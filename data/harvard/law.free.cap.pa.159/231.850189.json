Coleman died domiciled in the state of New York, without lineal heirs, leaving a will by which she directed as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-15\">\u201c 6.

The material facts are these :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b261-19\">\u201c Julia C. Coleman died domiciled in the state of New York, leaving a will, in which she directed her executors \u2018 to sell and convey all the rest, residue and remainder \u2019 of her real estate and \u2018 convert the same into money and apply the proceeds aris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>ing therefrofn \u2019 toward, the payment of certain legacies given to collaterals. Included in this residue is real estate situated in this commonwealth, part of which these accountants have sold under said power, and the proceeds are here for distribution. Between the dates of Julia C. Coleman\u2019s death and this sale, the register made an appraisement of the land for the purpose of collateral inheritance tax, and from that appraisement no appeal has been taken. The register now claims the tax out of this fund, and the accountant denies its liability, because the legatees \u2018acquire nothing more under the will than a right to receive a sum of money out of the proceeds of sale; a mere chose in action ; a claim of strictly personal character.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b262-4\">\u201c The solution of the question involved in this case turns mainly upon the application of the maxim that the situs of personal property follows' the domicile of the owner. It was said in Small\u2019s Est., 151 Pa. 1, that as a general rule intangible personal property of a nonresident, such as bonds, mortgages and other choses in action, is governed, as to its situs, by the fiction of law above noticed, and hence such property is not subject to collateral inheritance taxation under the act of 1387, because not situated in this state. Some species of personal property, it is true, when used in carrying on business or for other particular purposes,- may have an actual as distinct from a legal situs ; but the local character of the use takes it out of the operation of the rule. And of this Small\u2019s Estate is of itself a striking illustration. Not only was the \u2018 thing \u2019 given employed in a business which was by its nature localized, but the manifest intent of the testator was that it should remain in this state. The bequest was specifically of testator\u2019s interest, including \u2018 all the property, real and personal, notes, stocks, bonds and accounts,\u2019 in a limited partnership organized under the laws, and having its principal place of business in this state. The value of the property depended largely upon its continuance here. There was no reason for its conversion and transmission to the testator\u2019s domicile, and it was given to the surviving partners as such in specie. The facts plainly made an exception to the general rule. The actual situs was here, and liability to the tax followed. It is urged upon behalf of the commonwealth that this case rules the present; but the facts differ in material respects. The gift here was of an interest in a fund whose distribution belonged to the domicile of the donor.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b263-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>\u201c It was said in Bittinger\u2019s Ap., 129 Pa. 338, that the collateral inheritance tax was not a succession, but a direct tax upon the * thing \u2019 given in the hands of the donees. What was the \u2018 thing \u2019 given to these legatees ? The answer is in Miller v. Com., Ill Pa. 321, in which it was held that where a testator domiciled in this state orders land situated without to be sold to pay pecuniary legacies, these legacies will pass to the legatees as money, subject to the domiciliary law, and consequently to the collateral inheritance tax. \u2018 Under all the decisions it cannot be questioned,\u2019 said the court, \u2018 that the third clause of (sale under the) will operated as a conversion of the residuary real estate into personalty efficacious from the moment of testator\u2019s death. . . . Had there been a mere direction to\" sell, as was the case in Drayton\u2019s Ap., 61 Pa. 172, we should have felt bound to hold there was no conversion, and that as the land was situated in another state it would not be subject to collateral inheritance tax.\u2019 The facts here are precisely similar, and should work the same result. The thing given was not land, but an interest in its proceeds. If bonds, notes, stocks, bonds and mortgages be intangible personal property, surely this is. The administration here being ancillary, the legatees have no status. Local debts and expenses having been paid, it is the sole duty of the administrator to transmit the balance to the domicile for administration. The collateral tax is imposed only on what remains for distribution after all the expenses of administration, debts and rightful claims of third parties, domestic as well as foreign, have been paid or provided for; it is only the net balance that is liable. How, then, is it possible to impose a tax on this fund when it has never been ascertained judicially how much or whether any of it will go to the collateral legatees ? Who can tell how much of the fund may be successfully claimed by creditors and others as against the legatees ? The court of the domicile is the only tribunal that can determine how much will ultimately go to them : Oreutt\u2019s Ap., 97 Pa. 179. Suppose the whole of the fund should be required for the payment of claims of domiciliary creditors, a tax imposed here now would be upon a class not within the purview of our law and unjust. Suppose the legatees should be entitled to receive only part of the fund upon which the tax is imposed here, the expense of recovering the excess would be a burthen. So, too, the impo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>sition of a tax here would result in the hardship of a double tax. It is apparent, therefore, that the imposition of a tax on the fund here would not only be unwarranted by the act of 1887, but would work injustice to these beneficial parties.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-4\">But in addition to these reasons, there is a question of public policy involved which is worthy of consideration. The rule that personal property follows the domicile of the owner is internationally recognized and observed as being founded in convenience (2 Wm. Exrs., 1515), and a disregard of it here may react to the prejudice of our own citizens.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-5\">\u201c The gift to these collaterals being, then, manifestly an interest in intangible personal property, is governed by the domiciliary law, and consequently cannot be taxed for collateral inheritance in this state : Miller v. Com., supra.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-6\">\u201c It has been suggested that a result from the rule here indicated will lead foreign testators to order the sale of their lands located here with a view to avoid liability for payment of collateral inheritance tax. But Miller v. Com., supra, will obviously have the same effect on testators domiciled here, and the one class will practically equalize the other and the state lose nothing.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-7\">\u201c It also follows logically that the assessment of the land owned by the testator as land by the register was without authority of law; it was not given to these collaterals ; and the assessment was, therefore, void.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b264-8\"><em>Error assigned </em>was (1) in holding that the lands of testatrix in Pennsylvania were not subject to collateral inheritance tax; (2) in not holding failure to appeal from appraisement conclusive.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b264-9\"><em>R.
