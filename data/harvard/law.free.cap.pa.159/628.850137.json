Before Fell, J.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b658-10\">At the trial, it appeared that, on Feb. 13, 1889, plaintiff was ejected from a car on defendant\u2019s Allegheny line. Plaintiff by mistake had taken an Allegheny avenue car instead of a car to Frankford where he lived. When the Allegheny avenue car reached its terminus he refused to get off unless his ticket or his fare was returned to him. The conductor refused to return either, and ejected him from the car. Plaintiff then took the car to Frankford. The conductor of the Frankford car and a passenger named Slafer testified that plaintiff made no com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>plaints of having received any injury, and that he was not apparently suffering from any. In rebuttal witnesses for plaintiff testified that at a criminal hearing of the conductor of the Allegheny avenue car for assault on plaintiff, Slafer had sworn that plaintiff had stated on the second car that he had been hurt at the hands of the conductor of the first car. The testimony of other witnesses for plaintiff tended to show that plaintiff was suffering from an injury shortly after he alighted from the second car.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b659-5\">The court below, after reviewing plaintiff\u2019s statement of his case and some of the evidence in behalf of defendant, charged:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b659-6\">\u201c [As to what occurred after he got upon the second car at Allegheny avenue there are three witnesses.

He testified that he got in this car at the lower part of Frankford; while he was talking to the conductor the plaintiff came out of the car and talked with him; that he said he had had a fuss with the conductor of the one-horse car; that after some further conversation, and as they'neared Orthodox street, seeing that the plaintiff was about to get off, he told the conductor to stop; the plaintiff was about to get off the car before it crossed the street; the conductor put his hand upon his arm to restrain him from so doing, at the same time ringing the bell, and held him in that position to prevent him getting off while the car was in motion, until the car had stopped on the. other side.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b659-8\">\u201c These witnesses both agreed in the statement that at that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>time there was no apparent injury of the plaintiff, and that he made no complaints.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b660-4\">\u201c The conductor is corroborated by the driver in saying that the plaintiff got upon his car while it was in motion and while the horses were trotting.
