By his will, dated March 18, 1891, after stating that his son, Dr. Edward Pepper, was amply provided for by the trust estate left to him by jhis father, the late George Pepper, he devised a legacy of $40,000 to Elvina <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>Eliza Mary Phelipot. The residue of his estate he directed to be divided into four parts. One of said parts he gave to the said Elvina Eliza Mary Phelipot; two other of said parts to Arthur M. Phelipot, and the remaining fourth part to David Pepper.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b539-3\">The son, Dr. Edward Pepper, filed a caveat and commenced taking testimony to contest this will. Pending these proceedings, after taking a great deal of testimony, he entered into an agreement of compromise, dated Feb. 27, 1893, by which he (Dr. Edward Pepper) withdrew all claim to the personal and real estate on the payment to him of $25,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b539-4\">David Pepper, the executor of the last will and testament of Edward Pepper, has paid the collateral inheritance tax on the real estate, and has also paid the collateral inheritance tax on all of the personal estate except the $25,000 paid to Dr. Edward Pepper, the son of testator, and the register of wills claims a similar payment on this $25,000.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b539-5\">The orphans\u2019 court disallowed the claim of the common-wealth, in the following opinion by Hanna, P. J.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b539-6\">\u201c The collateral inheritance tax is imposed, by the act of 1887, only upon such portion of the estate of a testator or intestate as passes at his death to the persons, etc., other than lineal descendants or ancestors described in the act. In this case, if the will was allowed to stand, the entire estate is liable to the tax; but the only son of testator, and to whom no bequest was made, for the reasons stated in the will, that he was already amply provided for, filed a caveat to contest the validity of the will. After some testimony had been taken, an agreement of compromise was entered into between some of the legatees and the caveator, whereby they authorized the executor to pay to him a certain sum out of the bequests to them in settlement of the controversy, and, in consideration thereof, the caveator agreed to withdraw the caveat, discontinue all proceedings, and that the will should be admitted to probate, etc.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b539-7\">u The question now arises-whether the legatees are liable not only to the collateral tax upon the balance of their legacies, but also to that upon the amount they agreed to pay the caveator in compromise and settlement. We have reached the conclusion that, under the most favorable construction of the act, so far as respects the contention on behalf of the commonwealth, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>they are not so liable, and for the reason that the amount paid the caveator was never received by them as legatees, and, under the act, it is only so much of the estate which actually passes to them by virtue of the will that is liable to the tax. It will readily be seen if the contest instituted by the caveator had been successful he would be entitled, under the intestate law, to the entire estate, and freed from the tax. But instead of further litigation he accepted a portion of the estate, relinquished his claim to the balance, and thus, of course, reduced the amount passing to the legatees, and, in fact, to the extent of the amount he received, the will is a nullity. So that all the legatees take is the amount of their bequests, after deducting the sum paid the caveator. And this they concede is subject to the tax.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b540-4\">\u201c This, we think, is the proper construction to be placed upon the act of assembly. A contrary view would not only be inequitable, but work a hardship upon legatees and distributees, and surely it was never contemplated thus to impose a double burden. And, it may be sirggested, the compromise is infinitely more to the interest of the commonwealth than if the terms of settlement were reversed, viz., the will set aside, the entire estate received by the caveator, and then he had paid the legatees, as a gratuity, the amount they now receive. No tax whatever would then be paid. And, as shown in Kerr\u2019s Est., 2 Dist. R., 535, [affirmed, the next case,] the payment to the caveator \u2018 simply reduced the estate afterwards passing to volunteers, with the same effect as if the reduction had been caused by the payment of debts, or if the payment or surrender had been the result of a suit terminating in favor of the claimant.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b540-5\">\u201c The appeal is sustained, and the appraisement for taxation corrected.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b540-6\"><em>Error assigned </em>was decree as above.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b540-7\"><em>Howard W. </em>Page, <em>S'. Davis Page, E. P. Allinson, Bois Pen-rose </em>and <em>W. U. Hensel, </em>attorney general, with them, for appellant. \u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Api\">If it be true that only so much of the estate as actually passes to the legatees is subject to the tax, and that money <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>not actually received by them is exempt, the tax could be evaded in every instance by merely assigning the legacy and authorizing the executor to make payment to the assignee; and a creditor of a legatee or distributee who had attached his interest in the fund in the hands of the executor or administrator would take clear of the tax.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b541-4\">The act imposes the tax upon all estates \u201c passing \u201d to col-laterals, not merely upon estates \u201c actually \u201d so passing; non constat, but that a devolution of title upon collaterals is a sufficient \u201c passing \u201d within the meaning of the act. This view is strengthened by the fact that the commonwealth\u2019s right to the \u25a0tax accrues, and is a lien on decedent\u2019s real estate, as of the date of his death: Frank\u2019s Est., 28 W. N. 328.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b541-5\">The legal effect of the compromise is the same as though the validity of the will had been established by a verdict in favor of proponents \u2014 the will is admitted to probate, the whole estate passes to collaterals, and of course becomes subject to the tax. As the record stands, the executor cannot with safety pay the whole of decedent\u2019s estate otherwise than to collaterals ; the orphans\u2019 court must so distribute it when his account is audited. The will once admitted to probate, the title of the collaterals to the whole estate, less debts and administration expenses, relates back to the testator\u2019s death, and must be taken to have accrued as of that date, so that the caveator must, necessarily, take mediately through the Phelipots under the agreement of compromise, and not directly from decedent, as in case of intestacy: 19 A. &amp; E. Enc. L., p. 181.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b541-6\">As the record stood the executor was bound to pay the whole estate to collaterals; the caveator had no standing.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b541-7\">The suggestion that the commonwealth should lose the tax because \u201cif the contest instituted by the caveator had been successful he would be entitled, under the intestate law, to the entire estate, and freed from the tax,\u201d overlooks the fact that the legal effect of the compromise was the same as though the will had been admitted to probate without opposition: Small\u2019s Est., 151 Pa. 1.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b541-8\"><em>John S. </em>Gerhard, for appellee,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Avqj\">not heard, cited: Act of May 6, 1887, P.
