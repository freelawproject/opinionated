He averred that defendant, as executor of Thomas Costigan, deceased, had charged excessive commissions in his account, and when his account was called for audit had agreed, in consideration of the distributees not asking for a surcharge, to pay his own counsel fees. The writing was as follows, signed by T. D. McGlathery and P. K.

That the memorandum signed by him was presented to him in the haste and excitement of the court room, and does not contain the agreement as he made it, nor was there any consideration for the same, except a threat to object to his commissions, which were not excessive, to wit: 2^ per centum upon $31,539.69, the proceeds of real estate. That the orphans\u2019 court did reduce defendant\u2019s counsel\u2019s fee from $500 to $440; to wit, $60.00, which the defendant is ready to pay.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b638-9\">\u201c That he has had and made a full settlement with all the distributees prior to their assignments to the plaintiff, and received from them releases of all demands due by him, except the sum of $2,800 (clerical error, should be $994.04), which was retained by him upon their express directions to pay orders given upon him by them, which sum has since been disbursed and paid, and full acquittance been given.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b638-10\">The court made absolute a rule for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence, assessing the damages at $846.71.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b638-11\"><em>Error assigned </em>was order as above.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b639-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number><em>Albert P. </em>Peterson, for appellant. \u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Adg\">An averment, in an affidavit of defence, that words contrary to the express understanding and agreement of the defendant were inserted in an obligation, is sufficient to justify submission of case to jury: Ecoff v. Gillespie, 13 W. N. 564; Church v. Jones, 132 Pa. 462.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b639-5\">Without a written acceptance by defendant or his authorized agent, there could be no recovery against him upon the order: Act of May 10, 1881, \u00a7 1, P. L. 17; Maginn v. Bank, 131 Pa. 362.</p>\n<p data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b639-6\">The affidavit and supplemental affidavit aver facts which, if proved on the trial, would oblige plaintiff to give evidence, dehors the instruments sued upon. It has been held that such averments justify the submission of the case to a jury: Hutchison v. Boggs, 28 Pa. 294; Converse v. Colton, 49 Pa. 346; Thompson v. Clark, 56 Pa. 33; Kaster v. Welsh, 157 Pa. 590.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b639-7\"><em>J. O. </em>Stillwell, for appellees. \u2014</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AGr\">An affidavit of defence should aver distinctly every fact necessary to constitute a defence; nothing should be left to inference : Peck v. Jones, 70 Pa. 83.</p>\n<p data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b639-8\">It has been held that it is only when a chancellor would reform the instrument that parol evidence is admissible to contradict it, and the evidence must be clear, precise and indubitable : Murray v. R. R., 103 Pa. 37; Phillips v. Meily, 106 Pa. 536 ; Sylvius v. Kosek, 117 Pa. 67; Jenks v. Fritz, 7 W. &amp; S. 201.</p>\n<p data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b639-9\">A mistake has been defined to be \u201c that result of ignorance of law or fact, which has misled a person to do an act which, if he had not been in error, he would not have done: \u201d Bisph. Eq. \u00a7 ,185; Bruse v. Nelson, 35 Iowa, 160.</p>\n<p data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b639-10\">A defendant should specifically state what the parol agreement is. He should state it so clearly that the court may decide whether it is not substantially the same as the writing: Fox v. Sheldrake, 1 Del. Co. R. 22; McBrier v. Marshall,. 126 Pa. 390; Johnson v. Blain, 126 Pa. 426; Ecoff v. Gillespie, 13 W. N. 564.</p>\n<p data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b639-11\">Acceptance of the order was not necessary: Act of May 10, 1881, P. L. 17; Maginn v.

Jaquett, 5 W. N. 183.</p>\n<p data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b640-4\">Payments and releases must be set out fully as to the dates, amounts, from and to and by whom made: McCracken v. Congregation, 111 Pa. 106; Blackwood v. Dean, 5 Lanc. L. R. 213; Hiestand v. Williamson, 128 Pa. 122. It is not sufficient to state that defendant has receipts for the money claimed: B. Association v. Phillips, 1 Luz. Leg. Rec. 104. Payments must be expressly stated to have been made on account of the claim in suit: Selden v. Bid. Assn., 81* Pa. 336. The consideration for the release must be shown: Kaufman v. Cooper Iron Co., 105 Pa. 537.</p>\n<p data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b640-5\">It is a fatal defect in an affidavit of defence to refer therein to a material paper which is accessible, without annexing a copy thereof, that the court may judge of the legal import of its terms: Erie City v. Butler, 120 Pa. 374.</p>\n<p data-order=\"51\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b640-6\">An instrument of writing is within the affidavit of defence law, if it be for the payment of money as contra-distinguished from one for the performance of any collateral undertaking, though not exhibiting on its face a prima facie right in the plaintiff to recover, if supplemented with such averments of facts as, with the instrument itself, would warrant a verdict for plaintiff: Vulcanite Paving Co. v. Phila. Traction Co., 115 Pa. 280.</p>\n<p data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b640-7\">The practice act of May 25, 1887, P. L. 271, embraces not only such instruments for the payment of money as weye within the affidavit of defence law prior thereto, but also all actions sounding in contract: Bradley v. Potts, 2 Dist. R. 79.</p>\n<p data-order=\"53\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b640-8\">It is respectfully suggested that, if the court is of the opinion that the affidavits present a sufficient defence to any of the plaintiffs\u2019 three items of claim, then the judgments entered in the case should be permitted to stand as to such items as to which the affidavits do not present a sufficient defence, and a venire awarded as to the former, only, under the provisions of the act of May 31, 1893, P. L. 185.</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"54\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"Aivz\">February 12, 1894:</decisiondate>\n<opinion data-order=\"55\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b640-9\">Opinion by</p>\n<author id=\"AT2\">Mr. Justice Green,</author>\n<p id=\"b640-10\">It must be confessed that the plaintiffs displayed but little wisdom in accepting the defendant\u2019s promises to pay them for excessive charges in his accounts, instead of corrections of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>accounts by the decree of the auditing judge. But whether wise or unwise, the defendant\u2019s promise to pay whatever fee should be allowed to his counsel, out of his commissions, and that the estate should not be charged with any amount as a fee to his counsel, was in writing, and his- affidavits set forth no real defence to it. It is of no consequence to say that it was signed by him \u201c in the haste and excitement of the court room,\u201d and \u201c does not contain the agreement as he made it.\u201d Such allegations are totally insufficient to set aside written agreements. There is no allegation of fraud, misrepresentation or mistake, or that he was induced by any parol promise which was subsequently broken, to sign the agreement, and nothing short of such defences could be heard against the contract. We think the affidavits disclose no defence against this part of the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-5\">As to the item $116.50 for excessive commissions charged in defendant\u2019s second account, he makes no defence at all except the general release subsequently asserted which will be presently considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-6\">As to the item of $173, it is \u2018founded upon a written order given by Boyd, defendant\u2019s counsel, on the defendant, for the payment of that amount of money out of the fees allowed him in the adjudication made by the orphans\u2019 court. The claim is only made upon the order, and not upon any promise of defendant to accept such an order, or any order, drawn by Boyd. It was never accepted by Daly and therefore he is not liable upon it as an order for the payment of money. Maginn v. Dollar Savings Bank, 131 Pa. 362; Hazleton Co. v. Improvement Co., 143 Pa. 581. As an equitable assignment of a fund it is of no avail against the affidavit of defence, which alleges that the acceptance was refused because Boyd was largely indebted to him. \u2022 We do not think it was necessary for the defendant to go into a minute specification of such indebtedness in an affidavit of defence, as the unaccepted order created no prima facie liability on Daly\u2019s part which he was bound to dispel by alleging a specific set-off. Any indebtedness from Boyd to him which did not leave the clear sum of $173 due to Boyd, would be a sufficient reason for refusing to accept, and as there is nothing on the record showing such air amount of indebtedness affirmatively, a denial of it is enough to carry the question to a jury, where the whole subject can be heard and determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>So far as the alleged releases are concerned they amount to nothing, for several reasons, one of which is alone sufficient to demonstrate the inadequacy of their allegation. The alleged promises of the defendant to pay were outside of the balances determined by the accounts to be due to the heirs, and therefore any releases of such balances would be no reply to such promises. Moreover the affidavits do not annex any copies of the releases nor disclose their contents, nor do they give any particulars from which their applicability to the defendant\u2019s promises of payments can be determined.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-5\">It is not clear that judgment can be entered for the plaintiffs under the act of May 31, 1893, P. L. 185. That act only provides that judgment may be taken for such amounts of the plaintiff\u2019s claim as are admitted to be due, and that execution may issue for such admitted indebtedness, with a right to proceed to trial for the remainder of the claim. It was doubtless passed to settle all doubts upon that subject, as there were different opinions relating to it. But it would be inapplicable in this case because these affidavits do not admit anything to be due. While in our opinion they are insufficient as to two items of the claim, they are not admissions of the correctness of those items, and literally the case is not brought within the terms of the act. We feel obliged with some reluctance to reverse the judgment because of the situation as to the third item of the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b642-6\">Judgment reversed and procedendo awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
