Childs, Esq., as master, who reported in favor of dismissing the bill.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b674-12\">Exceptions to the master\u2019s report were dismissed by the court, in the following opinion, by Weand, J.:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b674-13\">\u201c This bill is brought for the cancellation of an executed contract of sale of certain shares of stock bought by the plaintiffs at a public sale and afterwards sold to the defendant Latshaw. The allegation is that Latshaw induced plaintiffs to sell him the stocks by false representations as to their value and as to his object in buying. The stocks consisted of 750 shares of the New York &amp; Middle Coal Field Railroad &amp; Coal Co., 1500 shares of the Arion Silver Mining Co., and 500 shares of the Montana Gold &amp; Silver Mining Co., and had belonged to one Daniel Latshaw, deceased, the father of defendant, and were bought by plaintiffs at an executor\u2019s sale of decedent\u2019s effects, held March, 1887, for 111.40.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b674-14\">\u201cAfter the sale, defendant Latshaw, who was one of the executors, remarked to the purchaser that the stocks were of no value, and that he did not know where the offices of the companies were located. In September, 1891, one C. R. Lindsay, who previously had been connected as secretary with the New York &amp; Middle Coal Field Railroad &amp;\u2019Coal Co., wrote to Daniel Latshaw, not knowing he was dead, inquiring whether he still held <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>any stock in said company, and asking the lowest price he would take for it, stating also that the stock had no market value but that he could use it at two dollars per share. This letter was received and answered bjr defendant S. B. Latshaw, who then wrote to Saylor, one of the plaintiffs, asking whether he still held the stocks bought at the sale, and what he'would take for them. A correspondence was then carried on between defendant and Saylor, in.which Latshaw stated that he believed the stocks had no intrinsic value, and that he could find no offices of the company, and offering twenty-five dollars for the lot. The parties, plaintiff and defendant, afterward met at Pottstown, when the stocks mentioned were sold to Latshaw for fifty dollars. It is alleged by plaintiffs that at the time of transfer Latshaw was asked by Saylor, \u2018 What is there in this stock that you appear so anxious to have it? You laughed at me when I bought it,\u2019 and that he replied, \u2018 I want it as a relic of my father\u2019s effects; it has no value, and no office or officers of the company,\u2019 and that these representations were the inducement to sell them to him. At this time Latshaw had Lindsay\u2019s offer of two dollars per share for the 750 shares of railroad and coal company stock. The other stocks had no market value, nor does it appear that the companies are still in existence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b675-3\">\u201c The plaintiffs could only find certificates for 600 shares of the railroad and coal company stock, but the assignment to Latshaw covered them all; but because of the missing certificates Latshaw could only realize on 600 shares of the railroad and coal company stock, for which he received f 1,200 from Lindsay. The bill prays for a reassignment of said shares and for an injunction to prevent further transfers.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b675-4\">\u25a0\u201c The master dismissed the bill for want of jurisdiction, holding that there was a complete and adequate remedy at law. Exceptions were filed by plaintiffs.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b675-5\">\u201cIn McGrowin v. Remington, 12 Pa. 56, Judge Bell, in speaking of cases for the recovery of chattels by a proceeding in equity, said: \u2018 The precise ground of this jurisdiction is said to be the same as that upon which the specific performance of an agreement is enforced, namely, that fruition of the thing, the subject of the agreement, is the object, the failureuf which would be but illy supplied by an award of damages; and that chancery always interferes where, from the nature of the sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>ject, or the immediate object of the parties, no convenient measure of damages can be ascertained, or where nothing could answer the justice of the case but the performance of a contract in specie.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b676-4\">\u201c There are exceptions to the well settled principles of law that equity will not enforce specific execution of contracts relating to chattels, as was ruled in Foil\u2019s Appeal, 91 Pa. 434; Goodwin Gas, Stove and Meter Co.\u2019s Appeal, 117 Pa. 514, and other cases. But we fail to find that plaintiffs have brought themselves within any of the excepted cases. To the plaintiffs these stocks have no special or peculiar value, and were not purchased for any special purpose. The only object of their purchase was to make money for them, and hence their only value to plaintiffs is what might be realized from a resale. When they bought, plaintiffs thought they were worthless, and did not even know that the companies had an existence; and, therefore, if there was nothing else in the case but a mere breach of contract, plaintiffs would have a complete and ample remedy at law for the loss sustained, if any.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b676-5\">\u201c This damage could be readily ascertained, as appears by the testimony in the case. It is no answer to say that the stocks other than the railroad and coal company stock have no market value, and that the damage on that account could not be ascertained, for it is apparent that as to them defendant made no fraudulent representation, for he knew nothing of their value, nor do the plaintiffs; and were it not for the railroad and coal company stock, this suit never would have been brought. In the language of the master: \u2018 The wrong, therefore, against which they complain is the acquirement of the coal stock from them for a nominal price. If they paid the full value of the coal stock they will, under their own showing, be entirely compensated for all damages consequent upon any wrong of the defendant.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b676-6\">\u201c Gan the bill be sustained upon the ground that the defendant Latshaw was a trustee ex maleficio, or upon the ground that he had practiced a fraud in procuring the stocks ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b676-7\">\u201c He occupied no fiduciary relation to the plaintiffs. What he said at the executors\u2019 sale had nothing to do with plaintiffs\u2019 purchase, and after that he was acting towards them as an individual, and their relations were simply that of vendor and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>vendee. He was not bound to disclose his knowledge of the value of the stocks, provided he did not make fraudulent representations or suppress the truth when it was his duty to speak. Plaintiffs had opportunities for informing themselves of the condition of the various companies, but they appeared to have taken but little interest in the matter. Was he guilty of such fraud as will entitle the plaintiffs to the relief asked for? It is true that a confidential relation is not necessary to establish a constructive trust, and that a trust may arise from actual fraud; but this fraud alone will not be sufficient to warrant relief, unless the parties relied upon the fraudulent representations which were the inducements to their contract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b677-3\">\u201cIn Adams\u2019s Equitjq 5 Am. Ed., *174, it is said: \u2018The jurisdiction for rescission and cancellation arises where a transaction is vitiated by illegality or fraud, or by reason of its having been carried on in ignorance or mistake of facts material to its operation. And it is exercised .... for setting aside executed conveyances or other impeachable transactions, where it is necessary to replace the parties in statu quo. And in such cases, though pecuniary damages might be in some sense a remedy, yet if fraud be complained of there is jurisdiction in chancery.\u2019 The author instances amongst cases of this character the procuring contracts to be made or acts to be done by means of willful misrepresentation, either express or implied, etc. But to constitute a ease of this kind there must be a representation, express or implied, within the knowledge of the party making it, reasonably relied on by the other party, and constituting a material inducement to his contract or act. Tested by this rule, have the plaintiffs a standing in a court of equity ?</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b677-4\">\u201c According to the evidence the coal company at all times had an office in Philadelphia, which was given in the city directory ; and it further appears that some time after the purchase by plaintiffs, Mr. Edelman visited New York to inquire about the stocks, having with him one of the certificates for the coal company stock. It thus appears that plaintiffs had means of information open to them, and that they investigated the matter. How can it be said, therefore, that they relied on Mr. Latshaw\u2019s representations as to value rather than on their own knowledge.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b678-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>\u201cIn Clapham v. Shillito, 7 Beavan, 146, it was ruled that \u2018 cases had frequently occurred in which, upon entering into contracts, misrepresentations made by one party have not been in any degree relied on by the other party. If the party to whom the representations were made himself resorted to the proper means of verification before he entered into the contract, it may appear that he relied on the result of his own investigation and inquiry and not upon the representations made to him by the other party.\u2019</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b678-4\">\u201cIn the case under consideration plaintiffs held the stock for four years, had made investigation, and. must have been convinced without any representations\u2019 from Latshaw that the stocks wer\u00e9 worthless.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b678-5\">\u201c It is also stated in Adams\u2019s Equity, 356, that a mere misstatement by the buyer of his motive in purchasing or in limiting the amount of his offer, will not bring the case within the class of cases in which equity will grant relief. And for this he cites Vernon v. Keys, 12 East, .632, where the vendee \u2018 falsely and deceitfully represented to the vendor that he was about to enter into partnership in the same trade with other persons-whose names he would not disclose, and that these persons would not consent to his giving the plaintiff more for his interest than a certain sum; whereas, in truth, neither A and B, with whom he was then about to enter into partnership, nor any other intended partners of his, had refused to give more than that sum, but had then agreed with the defendant that he should make the best terms he could with the plaintiff, and would have given him a larger sum. And in fact the defendant charged them with a larger price in account for the purchase of plaintiff\u2019s interest.\u2019 Held, that an action on the case did not lie for this false and deceitful representation by the bidder of the seller\u2019s probabilities of getting a better price for his property, for it was either a mere false representation or at most a gratis dictum of the bidder upon a matter which he was not under any legal obligation to the seller to disclose with accuracy, and on which it was the folly of the seller to rely.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b678-6\">\u201c There is another reason which is fatal to the plaintiffs\u2019 contention. It is apparent that plaintiffs are seeking to recover damages for their loss, and not to recover the specific chattels sold. It is not alleged nor shown that the stocks have to them <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>any especial value apart, from their money value, and plaintiffs will be placed in statu quo when they are paid what they have lost in money. In Mackintosh v. Tracy, 4 Brews. 59, it was held that \u2018 in cases of fraud, especially where the fraud relates to sales of personal chattels, and where the 'relief sought is merely compensation in damages, if the remedy at law is adequate, relief is not ordinarily granted in equity.\u2019 See also Parsons on Contracts, vol. 2, p. 782.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b679-3\"><em>Errors assigned </em>were dismissal of exceptions.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b679-4\"><em>Charles </em>Hunsiclcer, for appellants,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aue\">cited: Mortland v.

But if the facts upon which the cause of action was grounded were all true, there was a complete and adequate remedy by an action at law, and for that reason there is no jurisdiction in equity. The opinion of the learned court below is a sufficient vindication of the correctness of the conclusions reached, and for the reasons therein stated the decree is affirmed.
