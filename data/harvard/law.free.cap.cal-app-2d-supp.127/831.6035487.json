In the second cause of action' in their complaint the plaintiffs allege that the purchase was induced by fraud<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"Supp. 832\">*Supp. 832</page-number>ulent representations on the part of the defendant, and seek to recover damages therefor. Following entry of judgment by the trial court in favor of the defendant and adverse to plaintiffs upon each cause of action, and the denial of motion for a new trial upon the second cause of action, plaintiffs filed their notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-4\">Concurrently with the filing of such notice of appeal, plaintiffs also filed documents entitled, \u201cThe Proposed Settled Statement on Appeal\u201d and \u201cNotice of Election to Appeal on a Settled Statement.\u201d Copies of the latter pleadings were served upon defendant\u2019s counsel by mail on April 6, 1954. Apparently no further proceedings were taken in the trial court to perfect the record on appeal until May 26, 1954, when the judgment roll, papers, and records were transferred to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-5\">Appellants\u2019 \u201cNotice of Election to Appeal\u201d recites that such appeal is taken in accord with the procedural requirements of rule 7 of the \u201cRules on Appeal from Municipal Courts in Civil Cases.\u201d Such rule provides for the serving and filing of a condensed statement, in narrative form, of pertinent portions of the oral proceedings, a filing by respondent of proposed amendments thereto; the settlement of the statement after notice and hearing by the trial judge, the engrossing of the settled statement by appellant; and the right of objection by respondent.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-6\">The proposed statement has neither been settled nor engrossed. The record before the court is, therefore, lacking in any authenticated or approved statement of the oral proceedings. Since the record on appeal has not been certified by the trial judge or the clerk, or stipulated to by the parties, it cannot be presumed to include all matters material to a determination of the points on appeal as provided by rule 21 as amended.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-7\">\u201cThe Proposed Settled Statement of Appeal\u201d consists of generalities and conclusions. It would be impossible for this court to reach any decision concerning alleged errors in law in the rulings of the trial court upon the basis of such statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-8\">For the reasons herein set forth the appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-9\">Mitchell, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-10\">Coughlin, P. J., deeming himself disqualified, did not participate in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b854-11\">A petition for a rehearing was denied August 19, 1954.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
