The issues at the core of this action have been before this Court, as well as the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, several times. These issues have also been presented to federal courts in Virginia and West Virginia.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Indeed, it is apparent to the Court that this lawsuit is simply another chapter in a consistent and dedicated effort by groups including the plaintiffs, associations representing numerous fruit growers along the east coast (the \u201cGrowers\u201d),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to evade obligations imposed by this Court in the prior suits. As discussed in further detail <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1023\">*1023</page-number>below, the Court will not permit such a result. '</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-4\">Procedurally, there are now before the Court three motions for summary judgment \u2014 the defendant DOL\u2019s motion for summary judgment as against the plaintiff Growers, and what amount to cross-motions between the Growers and the defendant-intervenors regarding counterclaims interposed by the defendant-intervenors. The defendant-intervenors consist of .a class of migrant farmworkers (the \u201cFarm-workers\u201d) whose right to wages under DOL regulations are at issue for the years 1983, 1984 and 1985. Also before the Court is the Farmworkers\u2019 request for certification of a class of defendant Growers who might be subject to potential liability under the Farmworkers\u2019 counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-5\">The Court has determined to grant DOL\u2019s motion for summary judgment; to grant the Farmworkers\u2019 motion for summary judgment as to 1983 and 1985; and to deny the Growers\u2019 motion<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for summary as to 1983, but to grant it as to 1984. The Court grants in part the Farmworkers\u2019 request for class certification, and denies the remainder without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-6\">II. <em>Facts:</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1107-7\">Although the general facts underlying the Grow\u00e9rs\u2019 complaint have been set forth in copious detail in this Court\u2019s prior opinions, as well as in the opinions of the Court of Appeals, it is useful to reiterate those facts as they bear upon the Court\u2019s decision here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-12\">In. 1978, the DOL adopted a regulation which requires growers who compensate migrant farmworkers by the piece (as opposed to. an hourly or other time-based wage) to modify their piece rates annually to ensure that the aggregate wage paid to such workers will be \u201cequal\u201d to the DOL\u2019s minimum <em>hourly </em>rate paid to foreign workers.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The DOL originally interpreted this provision as requiring growers to hold productivity constant and to increase piece <em>rates </em>in order to ensure an aggregate equality between piece workers and hourly workers as the DOL\u2019s minimum hourly rate increases over time.' Absent such an interpretation, growers could create a false equality by demanding that piece workers increase productivity in order to bring their aggregate wage up to that paid hourly workers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-13\">In 1980, however, the DOL changed, its position. In approving the applications of growers to employ migrant workers, and in a subsequent 1981 interpretive letter, the DOL effectively took the position that a grower could increase productivity, rather than piece rates, in order to satisfy his obligation to establish aggregate wage equality between piece and hourly workers.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In <em>NAACP v. Donovan, </em>558 F.Supp. 218 (D.D.C.1982) (Richey, J.) <em>(\"NAACPI\u201d), </em>this Court rejected the DOL\u2019s interpretation.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>. . The plaintiffs in this action were not parties to that proceeding, and the DOL did not appeal from this Court\u2019s ruling. However, the DOL only applied the ruling of <em>NAACP I </em>to growers in West Virginia, the location of the workers on whose behalf <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1024\">*1024</page-number>the suit had been brought.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1108-4\">Because the DOL gave this Court\u2019s ruling in <em>NAACP I </em>such limited effect, the plaintiffs returned to this Court. In <em>NAACP v. Donovan, </em>566 F.Supp. 1202 (D.D.C.1983) (Richey, J.) <em>(\u201cNAACP II\u201d), </em>this Court, among other things, expanded the scope of <em>NAACP I </em>to include states other than West Virginia.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-5\">Apparently uncomfortable with the trend of litigation, and in compliance with an order of a federal district court in Virginia,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the DOL determined to cure the problem in 1983 by promulgating' a new rule. The new rule was intended to embody the average worker piece rate formula \u2014 rejected by this Court in <em>NAACP I </em>and <em>NAACP II\u2014 </em>and would have permitted growers to establish wage equality between foreign piece and hourly workers by requiring increased productivity. In an unpublished order dated September 8, 1983, this Court enjoined enforcement of the new rule, and directed growers to either pay the higher rates under <em>NAACP I </em>and <em>NAACP II </em>or place the difference into an escrow account. However, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia dissolved the injunction, and remanded the matter to this Court to determine the propriety of DOL\u2019s rulemaking procedure under the APA. <em>NAACP v. Donovan, </em>737 F.2d 67 (D.C.Cir.1984) <em>(\u201cNAACP III\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1108-11\">On remand, this Court approved the DOL\u2019s rulemaking procedure, and validated the DOL\u2019s average worker piece rate rule. As a result, while this decision was on appeal, the DOL permitted compliance with the new rule in growers\u2019 1984 job clearance orders. However, after the job clearance orders were approved, and average worker piece rates paid thereunder, the Court of Appeals reversed the decision of this Court as to the validity of the DOL\u2019s rule under the APA. <em>NAACP v. Donovan, </em>765 F.2d 1178 (D.C.Cir.1985) <em>(\u201cNAACP IV\u201d). </em>On remand, this Court reiterated the applicability of the prior rulings in <em>NAACP I </em>and <em>NAACP II, </em>and ordered that they be given prospective application. <em>NAACP v. Brock, </em>No. 82-2315 (D.D.C. August 14, 1985).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> As a result, average worker piece rates were paid to piece workers in 1984, but under an invalid rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-12\">The plaintiffs in this action (the Growers) were never parties to any of the ltigation that took place in this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1108-13\">In 1985, the Growers filed their job clearance orders with the DOL, promising to pay the proportional piece rate in the event the Court of Appeals and this Court determined that such payments would ultimately be appropriate.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The growers subsequent<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1025\">*1025</page-number>ly submitted letters to the DOL stating that they would pay the proportional piece rates \u201cunder protest\u201d because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1109-4\">The growers understand that, unless they execute these documents, their job orders will not be accepted by the Department of Labor for recruitment of United States workers nor will the growers\u2019 certifications for temporary foreign labor certifications be approved. We further understand that the Department of Labor will not accept a statement of protest on the face of the job order and therefore that a separate letter is the proper vehicle for entering such a protest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1109-5\">Accordingly, you are hereby advised that the growers in no way waive their right to challenge the contents of this amendment, administratively or in the courts, and, if successful, the growers reserve the right to amend their job orders accordingly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1109-6\">Pl.Comp. at \u00b6 33. In fact, following this Court\u2019s assertion of the continuing validity of <em>NAACP I </em>and <em>NAACP II </em>on August 14, 1985, the Growers did <em>not </em>pay the proportional piece rate. Instead, when reminded of their obligations to do so, the Growers filed this suit.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1109-7\">With this action, the Growers specifically challenge, under the APA, the DOL\u2019s actions in seeking to enforce the payment of the higher wage rate in 1985. The Growers contend that the DOL\u2019s actions in requiring adherence with <em>NAACP I </em>and <em>NAACP II </em>in 1985 were \u201carbitrary, capricious, contrary to law, and an abuse of discretion.\u201d As a practical matter, of course, the Growers\u2019 broader goal is to challenge the accuracy and continuing validity of this Court\u2019s rulings in <em>NAACP I </em>and <em>NAACP II. </em>Excusing themselves from the direct mandate of these rulings by virtue of the fact that they were not parties to the litigation, the Growers seek a declaration from this Court that the DOL\u2019s earlier average worker piece rate interpretation of 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 655.207(c) \u2014 an interpretation expressly repudiated in <em>NAACP </em>I \u2014 controls their wage obligations with respect to 1985, as well as in the future.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1109-11\">After the suit was filed, a group of migrant workers (the Farmworkers) intervened as defendants. As defendant-intervenors, the Farmworkers interposed counterclaims against the Growers for back piece-rate wages under <em>NAACP I </em>and <em>NAACP II </em>(the proportional piece rate) for the years 1983, 1984 and 1985. In addition to their claims against the Growers, the Farmworkers also seek certification of a defendant class of agricultural employers for purposes of liability under their counterclaim. The Farmworkers request certification of a class under Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(2), the members of which would consist of all agricultural employers who were members of the plaintiff associations in 1985 and who paid the lower rates in 1983, 1984 or 1985. The Growers have stipulated to such a class, but only as to 1985; they object to any class which would include employers who paid the average worker piece rate in 1983 or 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b1109-12\">Everyone has moved for summary judgment. As noted above, the Court grants the DOL\u2019s motion as against the Growers; grants the Farmworkers\u2019 motion as against the Growers for 1983 and 1985; and denies the Growers\u2019 motion as against the Farm-workers as to 1983, but grants the Growers\u2019 motion as to 1984. The Court further certifies a defendant class for 1985, but denies without prejudice the Farmworkers\u2019 request for certification of a defendant class for 1983, and denies with prejudice certification of a class for 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1026\">*1026</page-number>III. <em>Discussion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1110-4\">A. The Original Action \u2014 Summary Judgment is Granted in Favor of the DOL</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-6\">In challenging the DOL\u2019s actions with respect to the Growers\u2019 1985 obligations, the Growers seek a declaration that the DOL has acted in a manner which was \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law,\u201d and thus in violation of \u00a7 706(2)(A) of the APA. They also ask that the DOL be enjoined from demanding proportional piece rate payments in the future.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-7\">As to 1985, the DOL did not violate the APA because, in directing the proportional piece rate payments, the DOL was merely complying with an express directive of this Court. After the remand of <em>NAACP III, </em>this Court unambiguously directed the DOL to apply 20 C.F.R. 655.-207(c) in a manner consistent with the decisions in <em>NAACP I </em>and <em>NAACP II. </em>Thus, this Court\u2019s Order expressly reinstated the law as it had existed prior to the DOL\u2019s attempted rulemaking in 1983, and expressly directed that the DOL should apply that law \u201cunless and until modified, amended, or revoked by valid rulemaking.\u201d <em>NAACP v. Donovan, </em>No. 82-2315 (August 15, 1985). Because the Court of Appeals held in <em>NAACP IV </em>that such \u201cvalid rulemaking\u201d had not taken place, the DOL\u2019s efforts to enforce the dictates of <em>NAACP I </em>and <em>NAACP II </em>were in no way arbitrary, capricious or not in accordance with law, Instead, particularly given that the DOL had no choice <em>but </em>to comply with this Court\u2019s Order, the DOL acted in a perfectly responsible and appropriate manner. <em>See, e.g., GTE Sylvania, Inc. v. Consumers Union, </em>445 U.S. 375, 386, 100 S.Ct. 1194, 1201, 63 L.Ed.2d 467 (1980) (\u201cpersons subject to an injunctive order issued by a court with jurisdiction are expected to obey that decree until it is modified or reversed, even if they have proper grounds to object to the order\u201d). An agency acting on the express instructions of a federal court simply cannot be deemed to have violated the APA; at the very least, the agency cannot be deemed to have acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner. <em>Cf., American Federation of Gov. Emp. v. Block, </em>655 F.2d 1153 (D.C.Cir.1981) (agency permitted to dispense with APA notice and comment when complying with order of federal court).</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-10\">The Growers\u2019 request for prospective relief (as distinguished from their 1985 APA challenge) raises in a very direct fashion the Growers\u2019 challenge to <em>NAACP I </em>and <em>NAACP II. </em>Although the DOL contends that the Growers\u2019 argument as to the prospective application of <em>NAACP I </em>and <em>NAACP II </em>is moot, in light of DOL\u2019s recent rulemaking on this issue, the continued uncertainty and litigation over the rule\u2019s validity counsels against a finding of mootness. <em>See AFL-CIO v. Brock, </em>835 F.2d 912 (D.C.Cir.1987) (requiring DOL to offer more detailed reasons for change of policy embodied in new rule). Nevertheless, the Court finds that the Growers are not entitled to prospective relief from the rulings in <em>NAACP I </em>and <em>NAACP II </em>because, while perhaps not participants in that litigation, the Growers are bound by the results of those actions under principles of collateral estoppel.</p>\n<p id=\"b1110-11\">When a party has notice of an action which may dramatically affect its interests, that party cannot without consequence sit idly by and refuse, for strategic reasons, to participate in that action. Although it is true that a party bears no general duty to intervene, <em>Chase Nat\u2019l Bank v. City of Norwalk, </em>291 U.S. 431, 441, 54 S.Ct. 475, 479, 78 L.Ed. 894 (1929), the compelling interests of finality in federal litigation, coupled with the implicit suggestion that to protect one\u2019s interests a party must act when those interests are first endangered,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> has led several courts to conclude that a failure to intervene when the opportunity presents itself may result in the loss of any right to collaterally attack the judgment rendered in the prior action. <em>Nat\u2019l Wildlife Fed. v. Gorsuch, </em>744 F.2d 963 (3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1027\">*1027</page-number>Cir.1984); <em>Safir v. Dole, </em>718 F.2d 475, 481-83 (D.C.Cir.1983). In this Court\u2019s view, the concerns which justify such an estoppel\u2014 particularly that of finality \u2014 are magnified when, as here, the subject matter at issue implicates not merely private interests, but the administration of a substantial administrative program.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-4\">In this case, the Growers had ample notice of both <em>NAACP I </em>and <em>NAACP II, </em>and were well aware that the resolution of those actions would have a profound impact upon their interests. Yet, the Growers \u2014 for strategic reasons \u2014 made no effort to participate in the resolution of the difficult and controversial questions presented in those cases. Although the Court recognizes that the basis of its holding is one which should be used sparingly, the Court nevertheless holds that under the circumstances of this case the Growers are now collaterally estopped from attacking the results reached in <em>NAACP I </em>and <em>NAACP II.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1111-5\">Parties should not be allowed to play games with federal courts; when a federal court decides a matter, particularly one involving the validity of an administrative practice which regulates conduct nationwide, finality concerns demand that the decision be given some weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-6\">Here, however, the Growers seek, in effect, to play games with the system under the guise of \u201cstrategic litigation.\u201d The Growers were well aware of the pendency of the lawsuit which produced the decision in <em>NAACP </em>J.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> They knew full well that the subject matter of the suit was of vital importance to their economic interests. Yet, they chose to stand on the sidelines. The reasons for the Growers\u2019 inaction are not difficult to discern. The Growers wanted to preserve their right to take two bites at the apple. They felt perfectly comfortable with the DOL\u2019s ability to defend its practice respecting piece rates, and therefore stood aside in hopes that the DOL would prevail in <em>NAACP I. </em>Had the DOL prevailed, the Growers\u2019 interests would have been protected without any effort on their part. Yet, the decision not to participate, in the Growers\u2019 view, preserved their right to launch successive, and potentially infinite, collateral challenges to <em>NAACP I </em>in the event of an adverse decision. In fact, this is precisely what has happened.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-12\">The federal judicial system should not be forced to tolerate such a result. Parties should not be permitted to trifle with the system in order to manufacture for themselves a \u201cno lose\u201d situation. Single decisions by federal courts, particularly in the administrative context, necessarily impact upon a broad array or parties and interests; indeed, some have suggested that in certain settings federal litigation is more akin to regulatory action. <em>See, e.g., </em>Chayes, <em>The Role of the Judge in Public Law Litigation, </em>89 Harv.L.Rev. 1281 (1976). While neither accepting nor rejecting such a view of the role of a federal court, the Court does note that a decision in this context is meaningless unless it is final; such a decision is without value unless it can be reasonably free of strategic collateral attack from those, necessarily large in number, who may be inconvenienced by its result. The current chaos surrounding the DOL\u2019s piece rate regulations \u2014 almost entirely a product of strategic attacks upon <em>NAACP I </em>and <em>NAACP II </em>brought by the Growers and others in different courts \u2014 is a testament to this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b1111-13\">The Court recognizes the due process implications of a finding of collateral estoppel here. The Growers were <em>not </em>parties to <em>NAACP I </em>or <em>NAACP II, </em>and the Court appreciates as well as they the maxim that every man is entitled to his day in court. Yet, as a practical matter, under Rule 24 the Growers were given their day in Court, but, for strategic reasons, they decided not to show up. Due process does not, or at least should not, be read to grant every party with a crafty lawyer the right to embroil the federal courts in a mess of wasteful and repetitive litigation. That is the very point of intervention under Rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1028\">*1028</page-number>24. The Growers could have participated in <em>NAACP I; </em>indeed, the Court would have appreciated their participation. For strategic reasons, the Growers chose not to do so. In this Court\u2019s view, by so doing they forfeited their right to challenge the result. The Court finds the Third Circuit\u2019s views in <em>Gorsuch </em>directly applicable here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1112-4\">\u201cClearly, plaintiffs were not outsiders unaware of litigation in progress that would ultimately affect their interests. In a deliberate choice of litigation strategy, they chose to stand on the sidelines, wary but not active, deeply interested, but of their own volition not participants. Although plaintiffs may not have had their day in court as litigants, they had the opportunity and for reasons of their own adopted a different approach. Plaintiffs cannot, at this stage, assert persuasively that the interest of finality should not prevail.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1112-5\">744 F.2d at 972.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-6\">Because the Growers are collaterally es-topped from challenging the results of <em>NAACP I </em>and <em>NAACP II, </em>summary judgment shall be granted in favor of the DOL with respect to the prospective application of 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 655.207(c) as interpreted in those decisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-7\">B. The Counterclaims \u2014 the Farmworkers\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment is Granted as to 1983 and 1985, and the Growers' Motion for Summary Judgment is Granted as to 1984</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-8\">As defendant-intervenors, the Farmworkers have brought counterclaims seeking back wages for the years 1983, 1984 and 1985. As a technical matter, the conclusion reached above \u2014 that the Growers are collaterally estopped from challenging the <em>results </em>of <em>NAACP I </em>and <em>NAACP II </em>\u2014 does not dispose of the Growers\u2019 actual wage obligations in the years 1983, 1984 and 1985. Because the Orders issued in those cases expressly bound only the DOL, the viability of the Farmworkers\u2019 counterclaims depends upon the specific facts surrounding the Growers\u2019 job claim orders in those years. For the reasons described below, it is more appropriate to treat the Growers\u2019 obligations with respect to the years 1983 and 1984 together, and to treat the year 1985 separately.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-11\">1. <em>Equitable Restitution Requires the Growers to Pay Back Wages for 1983, But Not for 1984</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1112-13\">In 1983, the DOL required all growers submitting job clearance orders to commit to the payment of the proportional piece rate, but only until the DOL could promulgate a valid rule expressly authorizing payment of the average worker piece rate. On September 2, 1983, the DOL promulgated that rule. On September 8, 1983, this Court enjoined DOL from giving effect to the new rule, and directed DOL to withhold certification from any grower who failed to either (i) pay the proportional piece rate (under <em>NAACP I </em>and <em>NAACP II) </em>for the remainder of 1983, or (ii) place the difference between the proportional piece rate and average worker piece rate into escrow. As noted above, this Order was overturned by the Court of Appeals in <em>NAACP III. </em>However, notwithstanding that reversal, in July of 1985 the Court of Appeals finally invalidated the DOL\u2019s new rule in <em>NAACP IV. </em>765 F.2d 1178 (D.C.Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-14\">In 1984, the DOL, in reliance upon the new rule \u2014 which, as described above, had not yet been invalidated<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u2014 did not require growers to commit to the higher piece rates under <em>NAACP I </em>and <em>NAACP II </em>in their job clearance orders. Accordingly, no growers \u2014 including the plaintiffs here\u2014 paid the higher rates during 1984. The question for decision, then, is whether the Growers are obligated to provide the Farm-workers with back pay for the latter portion of 1983 (for the period following promulgation of the DOL\u2019s rule on September 2, 1983), and for all of 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b1112-15\">The Court finds that the Growers must provide back pay for the pertinent portion of 1983, but that the Growers shall not be required to provide back pay for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1029\">*1029</page-number>1984. The legal principle underlying the Court\u2019s decision is that expressed in <em>Democratic Central Comm. of D.C. v. Wash. Metrop. Area Transit Comm., </em>485 F.2d 786 (D.C.Cir.1973). In that case, the court noted that when funds have been either paid or withheld pursuant to an invalid administrative edict, the proper remedy is equitable restitution. 485 F.2d at 824 (relying upon <em>Williams v. Wash. Metrop. Area Transit Comm., </em>415 F.2d 922 (D.C.Cir.1968)). However, because the restitutionary remedy is a matter of equity, reimbursement of funds will be required \u201conly to the extent that justice between the parties requires.\u201d 485 F.2d at 825 (quoting <em>Williams, </em>415 F.2d at 944). Equity will require such a result \u201conly when the money was obtained in such circumstances that the possessor will give offense to equity and good conscience if permitted to retain it.\u201d 485 F.2d at 825 (quoting <em>Williams, </em>415 F.2d at 944).</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-4\">Here, the dictates of equity suggest that the Growers should be required to pay the full amount owing under <em>NAACP I </em>and <em>NAACP II </em>for 1983, but not for 1984.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-5\">As to both years, the Growers\u2019 sole justification for paying the average worker piece rate \u2014 for part of the year in 1983 and for the entirety of 1984 \u2014 was the existence of the DOL\u2019s new regulation, later found to be invalid. In 1983, however, at the time the Growers (at least those that actually did so<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>) decided to pay the average worker piece rate and forego escrow payments, they did so in direct violation of this Court\u2019s Order of September 8,1983. Moreover, in light of that Order, even those that placed the funds in escrow did so knowing full well that the DOL\u2019s rule was, if not flatly invalid, of at least dubious validity. Further, to the extent any of the Growers failed to pay the proportional piece rates <em>before </em>issuance of the DOL\u2019s regulation\u2014 on the expectation that it would be issued <footnotemark>16</footnotemark> \u2014 they did so in violation of the DOL job clearance order issued with respect to that year. Under these circumstances, equity simply will not permit the Growers to retain funds wrongfully withheld during 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b1113-10\">The year 1984, however, presents a different issue. In accepting job clearance orders for 1984, the DOL did <em>not </em>require\u2014 as it had in 1983 \u2014 compliance with <em>NAACP I </em>and <em>NAACP II. </em>Instead, based upon the fact that this Court\u2019s September 8, 1983 ruling had been reversed by the Court of Appeals in <em>NAACP III, </em>the DOL merely required that growers commit to compliance with DOL\u2019s new regulation in setting piece rates. Accordingly, in paying the average worker piece rates during 1984, the Growers had no particular reason to believe or suspect that they were acting improperly. Instead, the decision in <em>NAACP III, </em>coupled with this Court\u2019s ruling on the remand of <em>NAACP III, </em>provided the Growers with a perfectly reasonable basis for believing that they were acting in complete compliance with the law in paying the average worker piece rates. At least during 1984, the Growers, in their job clearance orders, had not committed to payment of anything else, and the law <em>then in effect </em>required payment of no more. In light of these facts, the Court finds that equity\u2014 \u201cjustice between the parties\u201d \u2014 does not require restitution of the amounts improperly withheld during 1984.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1114-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1030\">*1030</page-number>2. <em>The Growers Must Pay Back Wages for 1985 as a Matter of Contract</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1114-4\">The Growers\u2019 behavior in 1985 is fundamentally different than that in 1983 and 1984. In 1985, the Growers could not have reasonably believed that payment of the average worker piece rate was consistent with law. As noted above, following the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>NAACP IV, </em>the DOL expressly directed growers around the country, including the plaintiffs here, to amend their job clearance orders to include a promise to pay the proportional piece rate in the event <em>NAACP IV </em>became effective during the 1985 harvest. Although perhaps done \u201cunder protest\u201d (and thereby implicitly conceding their <em>legal </em>obligations to pay the proportional piece rate) the Growers amended their job clearance orders as instructed. On August 14, 1985, by Order of this Court, <em>NAACP IV </em>became effective. Yet, notwithstanding the commitment made in their job clearance orders, the Growers refused to pay the proportional piece rate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-5\">The Court holds that the Growers were bound to pay the proportional piece rate during 1985. It has been noted, properly in this Court\u2019s view, that the contents of a job clearance order under the Wagner-Peyser Act effectively constitute a contract between an employer and the employees subject to it. <em>Espinoza v. Stokely-Van Camp, Inc., </em>641 F.2d 535, 540 (7th Cir.1981) (employer liable to employees if job clearance order misrepresents actual terms of employment); <em>Western Col. Fruit Growers Assoc. v. Marshall, </em>473 F.Supp. 693, 696 (D.Colo.1979) (\u201cPlaintiff's clearance order is essentially an offer for a contract of employment\u201d; the contract may be accepted by individual employees).</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-6\">Here, the undisputed facts indicate that the Growers amended their 1985 job clearance orders, in response to the DOL\u2019s directive, solely in order to preserve their right to participate in the migrant farm-worker program. That the Growers felt compelled to make the amendment \u2014 upon pain of non-participation in the program\u2014 reflects a complete understanding on their part that the promise of wages at the higher rate embodied an essential term of the contract, as to both the DOL and the Farm-workers. Quite simply, the Growers made a promise in 1985, and they failed to keep it. The Growers accepted the benefits of the migrant farmworker program, but reneged on their promise to pay the price of participation, a price clearly established by both the DOL and this Court. The direct losers, of course, are those least able to defend their interests \u2014 the Farmworkers. The Court regards the Growers\u2019 actions in 1985 as self-serving and duplicitious, and will not permit the Growers to profit by such behavior. The Growers will be held liable for the consequences of their broken promises.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-8\">The Growers seek to avoid their 1985 wage obligations by asserting that the the commitment to pay the proportional piece rate was (1) ambiguous, and therefore incapable of supporting contract liability, (2) made under protest, (3) made under duress, and (4) never relied upon by the Farmworkers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-9\">The Court rejects each of the Growers\u2019 arguments. The Growers\u2019 promises in the amended 1985 job clearance orders were as unambiguous as it could possibly have been: the Growers promised to pay the higher rates, if and when they became legally obligated to do so. The language of the Growers\u2019 promise is clear, and it became effective when this Court issued its August 15, 1985 Order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1114-10\">As to the Growers\u2019 contention that the 1985 commitments were made under pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1031\">*1031</page-number>test, the language of the protest letters themselves makes clear that the Growers merely reserved the right to \u201cchallenge the contents of [the] amendment, administratively or in the courts.\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> The Growers stated that \u201cif successful\u201d in such a challenge, they \u201creserve the right to amend their job orders accordingly.\u201d However, nowhere in the protest letters do the Growers reserve the right <em>not to pay the wages </em>to which they had committed themselves in the 1985 job clearance orders as those wages became due. The letters merely reserved the right to lodge a subsequent challenge to the legal propriety of the DOL\u2019s position (in essence, to the propriety of <em>NAACP I </em>and <em>NAACP II). </em>In sum, the Growers claim that the protest letters overrode the job clearance order, that the letters granted the Growers <em>carte blanche </em>to ignore the commitment made in the job clearance order. The very language of the letters belies this claim. Moreover, even if the letters were framed as the Growers contend, the Growers\u2019 position \u2014 both as to its argument that the job clearance orders were accepted under protest and that they were agreed to under duress \u2014 simply finds no support in the law. <em>Matter of Penn Central Transp. Co., </em>831 F.2d 1221, 1231 (3rd Cir.1987) (\u201cClearly, Penn Central cannot, with full knowledge of the facts, accept the benefits of [a regulatory contract] and then ... attempt to take an inconsistent position in order to avoid its obligations under those contracts.\u201d); <em>Kaneb Services, Inc. v. Federal Savings and Loan Ins. Corp., </em>650 F.2d 78, 81 (5th Cir.1981) (\u201cIt is recognized that under the doctrine of equitable estoppel a party with full knowledge of the facts, which accepts the benefits of a transaction, contract, statute, regulation, or order may not subsequently take an inconsistent position to avoid the corresponding obligations or effects.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-4\">The Court further rejects the Growers contention that they cannot be liable for 1985 because none of the Farmworkers saw or relied upon the promise of higher wages. Even if true, the Court regards this fact as irrelevant. The terms of a job clearance order which reflect DOL requirements become a part of the employment contract as a matter of law. <em>Salazar-Calderon v. Presidio Valley Farmers Ass\u2019n, </em>765 F.2d 1334, 1342 (5th Cir.1985). An employer is expressly obligated to make those terms clear to his employees, <em>id. </em>at 1342. The fact that the Growers may have failed to do so, or that for whatever reason the Farmworkers may never have been aware of the job clearance order amendment, in no way minimizes the Growers\u2019 contractual obligation in this context.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-9\">Because the Growers made a contractual commitment to pay the higher wage in 1985, and because they failed to do so, the Growers shall be liable to the Farmworkers for the difference between the amounts owed under the proportional piece rate formula and the amounts actually paid in that year.</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-10\">C. The Farmworkers\u2019 Motion for Certification of a Defendant Grower Class Shall be Granted as to 1985, But Denied Without Prejudice as to 1983</p>\n<p id=\"b1115-11\">As noted above, the Farmworkers have moved for the certification of a defendant class of Growers who might be liable on the Farmworkers\u2019 counterclaims. The Farmworkers seek to certify, under Fed.R. Civ.P. 23(b)(2), a class which would include all members of the plaintiff associations in 1985 who paid the lower wages during the years 1983, 1984 or 1985.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The Growers have stipulated to such a class with respect to 1985. As noted above, however, the Court has concluded that the Growers shall not be liable with respect to 1984. At this juncture, then, the question is whether the Court should certify, under Rule 23(b)(2), a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1032\">*1032</page-number>class of association members who paid the lower wages in 1983 and 1985.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-4\">Recent developments in the law have complicated the matter somewhat. In <em>Henson v. East Lincoln Township, </em>814 F.2d 410 (7th Cir.1987), Judge Posner held, in what was apparently the first opportunity for close consideration of the issue at the appellate level, that certification of a defendant class is never permissible under Rule 23(b)(2). The United States Supreme Court has granted <em>certiorari. </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 108 S.Ct. 283, 98 L.Ed.2d 244 (1987). Accordingly, it appears to be the law \u2014 in at least the Seventh Circuit, and without reasoned contrary appellate authority \u2014 that Rule 23(b)(2) does not contemplate a defendant class of the type sought here. <em>See, e.g., Williams v. State Bd. of Elections, </em>696 F.Supp. 1563, 1573 (N.D.Ill.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-7\">On the other hand, the Court notes that prior to <em>Henson </em>it was common practice to certify defendant classes under Rule 23(b)(2). H. Newberg, <em>Newberg on Class Actions, </em>\u00a7 4.64 (2d ed.1985). Further, in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s grant of <em>certiorari </em>in <em>Henson, </em>it can fairly be said that the propriety of a defendant class under Rule 23(b)(2) remains an open question. However, it appears that several courts have certified defendant classes under Rule 23(b)(2) <em>since </em>the decision in <em>Henson. See, e.g., Nat\u2019l Broadcasting Co., Inc. v. Cleland, </em>697 F.Supp. 1204, 1217 (N.D.Ga.1988); <em>United States v. Rainbow Family, </em>695 F.Supp. 314, 321 (E.D.Tex.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-8\">Because the Court\u2019s present authority to certify a defendant class under Rule 23(b)(2) is uncertain, the Court has determined to take a middle course on the issue. As to 1983, given that the parties are in sharp dispute as to the propriety of certifying a defendant class for that year, the Court will deny the Farmworkers\u2019 motion, but without prejudice. Once the Supreme Court disposes of <em>Henson, </em>the Farmworkers may renew their request for class certification as to 1983 in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s disposition, and the Court will retain jurisdiction to entertain such a request.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-9\">As to 1985, however, the Court will give effect to the stipulation of the parties, and will certify a defendant class. In light of the presently uncertain legal environment, the Court views the agreement of the parties as having substantial weight, and finds it proper under these circumstances to certify a defendant class under Rule 23(b)(2). In accordance with the parties\u2019 stipulation, this defendant class will consist of all \u201c1985 employer members of the plaintiff associations (other than the New Hampshire grower members of the New England Apple Council) who were certified to employ H-2 workers and who paid their fruit pickers piece rates that did not conform to the proportional increase interpretation of 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 655.207(c) in the year <em>1985.\u201d</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1116-11\">This resolution of the class certification question, coupled with the liability determination made above, gives the Farmworkers the right to immediately obtain back wages for 1985 from the members of the certified class. As to 1983, however, the Farmworkers must await the Supreme Court\u2019s disposition of <em>Henson. </em>Obviously, the Farm-workers will have the right under this decision to immediately obtain back wages from those individual growers who are plaintiffs in this action <em>and </em>who failed to pay the proportional piece rate in 1983. The Farmworkers must wait, however, before they may obtain 1983 back wages from growers who were members of the plaintiff associations in 1985, but who were not also individual plaintiffs here.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-12\">An Order in accordance with the foregoing shall be issued of even date with this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-13\">APPENDIX A</p>\n<p id=\"b1116-14\">Prior litigation referenced in and relating to the issues raised in <em>Frederick County Fruit Growers, et al. v.

As detailed in <em>NAACP I, </em>in 1980 the DOL approved the applications of several growers to pay piece rates to workers that were based on an expected productivity of 80 <em>boxes </em>of apples per day. Previously, the DOL had only approved rates based on an expected productivity of 80 <em>bushels </em>per day. Because boxes are approximately 12% larger than bushels, the conversion from bushels to boxes to bushels forced the workers to increase productivity by at least that amount if they were to make the same wage in 1980 that they made in 1979. <em>NAACP I, </em>558 F.Supp. 218, 221-22 (D.D.C.1982). Simply put, the conversion from boxes to bushels, and the fact that the growers sought to pay the same wage for a box as they had paid for a bushel, \u2022was \u2014 and essentially remains \u2014 at the heart of the dispute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1108-6\">.

As of this writing, that challenge is before Judge Sporkin of this Court, and has not been resolved. <em>See, e.g., AFL-CIO v. Brock, </em>835 F.2d 912 (D.C.Cir.1987).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b1110-8\">. To this extent, the analysis employed seems to implicate the concerns underlying the equitable doctrine of laches.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b1111-7\">. Indeed, the Farmworkers assert in their Statement of Material Facts Not in Dispute that counsel for the Growers was in the courtroom during the pivotal hearing which led to the <em>NAACP I </em>decision. Int. St. at \u00b6 6. The Growers have offered nothing to rebut this claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b1112-9\">. Indeed, on the remand to this Court after <em>NAACP III, </em>this Court found the rule valid under the APA. This is the ruling that was in effect at the time the DOL processed job clearance orders in 1984.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b1113-6\">. It is not clear which of the plaintiff growers actually complied with the Court\u2019s Order of September 8, 1983, by either paying the proportional piece rates or by placing the difference in escrow. Only those that continued to pay the proportional piece rates, under <em>NAACP I </em>and <em>NAACP II, </em>will escape liability under the decision announced herein.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b1113-7\">. In <em>Kent Barley, see supra </em>note 7, Judge Turk had ordered the DOL to promulgate the new average worker piece rate regulation prior to September 1, 1983. Thus, the DOL may have approved the job clearance orders of a number of growers, and payments may have been made, prior to promulgation of the new rule. However, any such prior payments would have been made under the 1983 job clearance orders then -in effect, which required payment under the proportional piece rate formula.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b1113-12\">.The Farmworkers\u2019 counterclaims also seek back pay for 1984 (as well as for 1983) on the grounds that the Growers have violated the -Wagner-Peyser Act and the regulations promulgated thereunder, as well as the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act (\u201cAWPA\"), and the regulations promulgated thereunder. Arguably; these claims would pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1030\">*1030</page-number>vide an alternative basis for receiving back pay even if the restitutionary remedy detailed above might not. However, in light of the fact that the Growers, at least in 1984, were acting in accordance with DOL\u2019s interpretation of applicable law, the Court is unwilling to find that the Growers violated either a statutory or regulatory scheme in that year. Further, it is at least questionable whether the Farmworkers enjoy a private right of action to enforce alleged violations of the Wagner-Peyser Act. <em>Compare Gomez v. Florida State Employment Service, </em>417 F.2d 569 (5th Cir.1969) (private right of action exists under Wagner-Peyser Act), <em>with De La Fuente v. Stokely-Van Camp, Inc., </em>514 F.Supp. 68 (C.D.Ill.1981), <em>aff\u2019d on other grounds, </em>713 F.2d 225 (7th Cir.1983) (no private of action under Wagner-Peyser Act).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b1115-5\">. The pertinent portion of the protest letter is set forth above in the text at page 1025.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b1115-6\">. As an alternative to class certification, the Farmworkers sought to join as counterclaim defendants, under Fed.R.Civ.P. 19, each grower member of the plaintiff associations. In light of the fact that the joinder motion drew no distinction between growers who had paid the average worker piece rate and those who had paid the proportional piece rate, and in light of the parties\u2019 subsequent partial agreement as to the scope of a class, the Farmworkers\u2019 Rule 19 motion is denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
