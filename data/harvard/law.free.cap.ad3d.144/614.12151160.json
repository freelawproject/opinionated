The lease provided that the plaintiff was to occupy the entire fourth floor of a building owned by Hamilton. In 2008, the plaintiff commenced this action against Hamilton, among others, alleging that, between October 2006 and November 2007, Hamilton failed to maintain the building\u2019s roof, resulting in the plaintiff\u2019s constructive eviction. In 2013, the defendants moved for leave to amend their answer to assert the affirmative defense of waiver of subrogation, and separately moved, inter alia, for summary judgment dismissing the complaint insofar as asserted against Hamilton. The Supreme Court denied the motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">\u201cIn the absence of prejudice or surprise to the opposing party, leave to amend a pleading should be freely granted unless the proposed amendment is palpably insufficient or patently devoid of merit\u201d <em>(Bernardi v Spyratos, </em>79 AD3d 684, 688 [2010]; <em>see </em>CPLR 3025 [b]; <em>Lucido v Mancuso, </em>49 AD3d 220 [2008]; <em>Unger v Leviton, </em>25 AD3d 689 [2006]). Here, the Supreme Court erred in denying the defendants\u2019 motion to amend the answer to assert an affirmative defense based on the waiver of subrogation provision in the lease between the plaintiff and Hamilton. The defense was not patently devoid of merit, and the plaintiff\u2019s claim of surprise and prejudice is unpersuasive considering that it was a party to the lease containing the waiver of subrogation provision <em>(see Rodless Decorations v Kaf-Kaf Inc., </em>232 AD2d 620, 621 [1996], <em>affd </em>90 NY2d 654 [1997]). Moreover, the plaintiff was on notice of Hamilton\u2019s intention to rely on the provision as a defense by virtue of a prior motion by Hamilton for summary judgment which was denied without prejudice to renew upon the completion of discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>However, summary judgment dismissing the complaint insofar as asserted against Hamilton based on the waiver of subrogation provision was properly denied. \u201cSubrogation, an equitable doctrine, allows an insurer to stand in the shoes of its insured and seek indemnification from third parties whose wrongdoing has caused a loss for which the insurer is bound to reimburse\u201d <em>(Kaf-Kaf Inc. v Rodless Decorations, </em>90 NY2d 654, 660 [1997]; <em>see Pennsylvania Gen. Ins. Co. v Austin Powder Co., </em>68 NY2d 465, 471 [1986]). \u201cWhile parties to an agreement may waive their insurer\u2019s right of subrogation, a waiver of subrogation clause cannot be enforced beyond the scope of the specific context in which it appears\u201d <em>(Kaf-Kaf, Inc. v Rodless Decorations, </em>90 NY2d at 660).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">In its bill of particulars, the plaintiff represented that it is not seeking to recover for damages for which it had been reimbursed by its insurance company. Rather, it was seeking to recover additional damages which were not covered by insurance. Moreover, it is undisputed that the insurance proceeds that were paid to the plaintiff were subject to deductibles in the total sum of $10,000. While Hamilton argues that the plaintiff has insurance coverage for some of the additional damages that it is seeking to recover in this action, it failed to demonstrate, prima facie, the absence of any triable issue of fact as to whether all of those damages were within the ambit of the waiver of subrogation clause. Such failure required the denial of summary judgment, regardless of the sufficiency of the plaintiffs opposing papers (see <em>Winegrad v New York Univ. Med. Ctr., </em>64 NY2d 851, 853 [1985]; <em>see also Gap v Red Apple Cos., </em>282 AD2d 119 [2001]; <em>Federal Ins. Co. v Honeywell, Inc., </em>243 AD2d 605, 606 [1997]).</p>\n<judges id=\"AUs\">Dillon, J.P., Roman, Hinds-Radix and Connolly, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
