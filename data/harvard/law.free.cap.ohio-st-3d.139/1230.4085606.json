D\u2019Apolito from presiding over any further proceedings in case Nos. 2008CY00388 and 2012CV01153 in the Court of Common Pleas of Mahoning County.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-14\">{\u00b6 2} For the reasons explained below, no basis has been established to order the disqualification of Judge D\u2019Apolito.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-15\">\n<em>Case No. 2008CV00388</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b742-16\">{\u00b6 3} Grenga claims that at a pretrial hearing in case No. 2008CV00388, Judge D\u2019Apolito showed bias towards him by threatening him with contempt and bringing a deputy sheriff into the courtroom to intimidate him. R.C. 2701.03, however, \u201cclearly limits the authority of the Chief Justice in determining the existence of interest, bias, prejudice, or disqualification to matters pending before the court of common pleas.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Grossmann, </em>74 Ohio St.3d 1254, 1255, 657 N.E.2d 1356 (1994). Therefore, \u201cthe Chief Justice cannot rule on an affidavit of disqualification when * * * nothing is pending before the trial court.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Hayes, </em>135 Ohio St.3d 1221, 2012-Ohio-6306, 985 N.E.2d 501, \u00b6 6. Here, Grenga has failed to identify what, if anything, remains pending in case No. 2008CV00388. Indeed, the docket shows that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1231\">*1231</page-number>case is closed, with the judge\u2019s most recent entry issued in December 2009. Accordingly, because there does not appear to be any matter pending in case No. 2008CV00388, Grenga\u2019s affidavit relating to the case is dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">\n<em>Case No. 2012CV01153</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">{\u00b6 4} In case No. 2012CV01153, Judge D\u2019Apolito issued an entry in January 2014 that (1) granted summary judgment in favor of defendant Jason A. Vantell on Grenga\u2019s claims, (2) granted summary judgment in favor of Vantell on his counterclaim for defamation against Grenga, and (3) sustained Vantell\u2019s motion for sanctions based on frivolous conduct against Grenga. The gravamen of Grenga\u2019s affidavit of disqualification is that the judge\u2019s recent entry \u201creeks with bias\u201d against Grenga because \u201c[tjhere is not one point in Honorable Judge Lou A. D\u2019Apolito\u2019s Entry that has merit.\u201d Grenga challenges the validity of the entry on several grounds and concludes that a \u201crational objective observer that read the Entry could only see the bias and prejudice in every sentence thereof.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">{\u00b6 5} It is the role of a judge to resolve difficult questions in contentious matters, and therefore judges often disappoint some or all of the parties involved in litigation. However, it is well established that \u201c[ajdverse rulings, without more, are not evidence that a judge is biased or prejudiced.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Russo, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 1208, 2005-Ohio-7146, 850 N.E.2d 713, \u00b6 5. Accordingly, affidavits of disqualification cannot be used to remove a judge from a case simply because a party is particularly unhappy about a court ruling or a series of rulings. \u201cProcedures exists by which appellate courts may review \u2014 and, if necessary, correct \u2014 rulings made by trial courts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 6. However, reviewing legal errors is not the role of the chief justice in deciding affidavits of disqualification, and \u201cneither a party\u2019s disagreement with a judge\u2019s determination, nor its dissatisfaction with a particular result, can supply the evidentiary showing needed to so reflect upon a judge\u2019s partiality as to mandate judicial disqualification.\u201d Flamm, <em>Judicial Disqualification, </em>Section 16.2, 445-446 (2d Ed.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">{\u00b6 6} For the reasons stated above, the affidavit of disqualification is denied. The cases may proceed before Judge D\u2019Apolito.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
