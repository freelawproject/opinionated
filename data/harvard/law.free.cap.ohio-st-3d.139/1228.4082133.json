This is the second affidavit of disqualification that Lemley has filed in the underlying case. His previous affidavit was denied by entry dated April 29, 2013, because Lemley failed to identify what remained pending before Judge Lowman.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-14\">{\u00b6 2} In his present affidavit, Lemley asserts that Judge Lowman is biased and prejudiced against him for the following reasons: the judge always rules in favor of the mother, despite what Lemley characterizes as \u201cundisputed evidence\u201d against the mother and despite the wishes of the minor child; the judge made a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1229\">*1229</page-number>comment in 2008 comparing Lemley to a mass murderer; the judge has commented that he hates pro se litigants; the judge has contempt for the working poor; and the judge\u2019s comments suggest that the judge is \u201cof mentally diminished capacity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">{\u00b6 3} Judge Lowman has responded in writing to the allegations in Lemley\u2019s affidavit, stating that Lemley\u2019s allegations are untrue, that he has been fair to Lemley in the past, that he will continue to be fair to Lemley in the future, and that all of his rulings have been based on the evidence and are in the best interest of the minor child.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">{\u00b6 4} For the reasons explained below, no basis has been established to order the disqualification of Judge Lowman.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">{\u00b6 5} First, most of Lemley\u2019s bias allegations are based on Judge Lowman\u2019s legal rulings. However, it is well settled that an affidavit of disqualification \u201cis not a vehicle to contest matters of substantive or procedural law.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Solovan, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 1214, 2003-Ohio-5484, 798 N.E.2d 3, \u00b6 4. And a party\u2019s dissatisfaction with a court\u2019s legal decisions, even if those decisions are erroneous, does not constitute bias or prejudice and is not grounds for disqualification. <em>In re Disqualification of Floyd, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 1217, 2003-Ohio-7351, 803 N.E.2d 818, \u00b6 4. The remedy for Lemley\u2019s legal claims, if any, lies on appeal, not through the filing of an affidavit of disqualification. <em>In re Disqualification of Russo, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 1208, 2005-Ohio-7146, 850 N.E.2d 713, \u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-8\">{\u00b6 6} Second, Lemley has failed to substantiate his remaining claims based on the judge\u2019s alleged prejudicial comments. In affidavit-of-disqualification proceedings, the burden falls on the affiant to submit sufficient evidence demonstrating that disqualification is warranted. <em>See </em>R.C. 2701.03(B)(1). \u201cGenerally, an affiant is required to submit evidence beyond the affidavit of disqualification supporting the allegations contained therein.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of Baronzzi, </em>135 Ohio St.3d 1212, 2012-Ohio-6341, 985 N.E.2d 494, \u00b6 6. Lemley claims that Judge Lowman made various prejudicial comments throughout these proceedings, but Lemley did not submit a transcript or other evidence to substantiate his allegations. Vague or unsubstantiated allegations are insufficient to establish bias or prejudice. <em>In re Disqualification of Walker, </em>36 Ohio St.3d 606, 522 N.E.2d 460 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b741-9\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cThe statutory right to seek disqualification of a judge is an extraordinary remedy. * * * A judge is presumed to follow the law and not to be biased, and the appearance of bias or prejudice must be compelling to overcome these presumptions.\u201d <em>In re Disqualification of George, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 1241, 2003-Ohio-5489, 798 N.E.2d 23, \u00b6 5. Those presumptions have not been overcome in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1230\">*1230</page-number>\u25a0{\u00b68} For the reasons stated above, the affidavit of disqualification is denied. The case may proceed before Judge Lowman.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
