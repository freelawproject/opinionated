(\u201cEast Bank\u201d), appeals the decision of the Board of Tax Appeals (\u201cBTA\u201d), which reinstated the county auditor\u2019s valuations for 21 condominium units owned by East Bank. Originally, a majority of this court rejected the auditor\u2019s valuations and accepted the bulk-appraisal valuation East Bank submitted. <em>Dublin City Schools Bd. of Edn. v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>139 Ohio St.3d 193, 2013-Ohio-4543, \u2014 N.E.3d - <em>(\u201cDublin City Schools I\u201d), </em>\u00b6 27. Today we grant, in part, the Dublin City Schools Board of Education\u2019s motion for reconsideration of our prior decision. We conclude that the BTA was correct in rejecting East Bank\u2019s bulk-appraisal valuation for the units, but was incorrect in adopting the auditor\u2019s valuations. Accordingly, we remand this matter to the BTA for an independent determination of value.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>\n<em>Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">{\u00b6 2} This case concerns the valuation of 21 units in East Bank\u2019s 28-unit condominium complex. As of tax-lien date January 1, 2008, the 21 units were still under construction and unsold. The Franklin County Auditor valued each unit as a separate parcel. The aggregate value of the 21 units amounted to $8,139,300. The property-record cards do not indicate, however, whether the auditor properly took into account the unfinished state of the units when determining their values, as required by Ohio Adm.Code 5703-25-06(G).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">{\u00b6 3} East Bank filed valuation complaints, challenging the auditor\u2019s assessments for each of the 21 units. The school board filed countercomplaints, seeking to retain the auditor\u2019s valuations.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">{\u00b6 4} At the board of revision (\u201cBOR\u201d) hearing, East Bank presented a report and testimony from appraiser Thomas Horner. After deducting the cost of finishing the units, Horner opined that the condominiums would yield \u201cgross sale proceeds\u201d of $6,492,294. Horner further determined that he had to value the units in bulk, because, in his view, all 21 condominiums were a \u201csingle economic unit.\u201d Accordingly, Horner discounted his figure to arrive at a \u201cnet present-value\u201d of $3,100,000, which is less than 48 percent of the predicted gross sale proceeds. According to Horner, this number represented what a single investor would pay for all 21 condominiums. The BOR adopted Horner\u2019s $3,100,000 bulk valuation.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">{\u00b6 5} The school board appealed to the BTA. The school board argued for adoption of the auditor\u2019s valuations, or, in the alternative, for adoption of Horner\u2019s \u201cgross sale proceeds\u201d value of $6,492,294. At the BTA hearing, the school board did not put on any witnesses or evidence. Instead, it focused solely on attacking the validity of Horner\u2019s appraisal.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">{\u00b6 6} The BTA found that Horner\u2019s bulk-appraisal method was improper. <em>Dublin City Schools Bd. of Edn. v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>BTA Nos. 2009-Q-1282 through 2009-Q-1301 and 2009-Q-1408, 2012 WL 3166815, *5 (July 24, 2012). It subsequently ordered reinstatement of the auditor\u2019s valuations, which totaled $8,139,300 for the 21 units. <em>Id. </em>at *6.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-10\">{\u00b6 7} East Bank appealed the BTA\u2019s decision to this court. East Bank argued in part that the BTA erred by rejecting Horner\u2019s bulk-discount methodology and by not valuing the condominiums as a single economic unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-11\">{\u00b6 8} On October 16, 2013, this court issued its original decision in this matter, reversing the BTA. <em>Dublin City Schools I, </em>139 Ohio St.3d 193, 2013-Ohio-4543, \u2014 N.E.3d -. We held that the BTA erred in reverting to the auditor\u2019s determinations of value. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 27. The majority opinion then concluded by \u201cadopting] the only evidence of valuation contained in the record presented by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>East Bank through its expert, resulting in a valuation of $3,100,000.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The majority opinion did not, however, consider whether the bulk-valuation approach, which was used by East Bank to arrive at the $3,100,000 figure, was appropriate. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 27, fn. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">\n<em>Questions Presented</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">{\u00b6 9} The school board has moved for reconsideration. Under S.Ct.Prac.R. 18.02, we use our reconsideration authority to \u201ccorrect decisions which, upon reflection, are deemed to have been made in error.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Huebner v. W. Jefferson Village Council, </em>75 Ohio St.3d 381, 383, 662 N.E.2d 339 (1995). We will not, however, grant reconsideration when a movant seeks merely to reargue the case at hand. S.Ct.Prac.R. 18.02(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">{\u00b6 10} The school board raises three grounds for reconsideration. First, it argues that this court erred in holding that the school board had to offer additional evidence of value in order to meet its burden of proof at the BTA hearing. This court already thoroughly considered the burden-of-proof issue in our first decision. <em>Dublin City Schools I </em>at \u00b6 14-16. The issue was the subject of much discussion and debate in this court\u2019s competing opinions. <em>See id. </em>at \u00b6 55-59. And all seven justices agreed, albeit for different reasons, that the school board needed to offer additional proof to the BTA. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 16, 58-59. Therefore, the school board\u2019s first argument does not call our attention either to an obvious error or an issue that this court did not consider. Accordingly, we decline to reconsider our opinion as to the school board\u2019s first claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">{\u00b6 11} Second, the school board contends that this court erred factually in holding that the school board did not produce any evidence of its proposed value at the BTA hearing. Specifically, the school board claims that it produced evidence when it made an alternative argument to the BTA in support of Horner\u2019s $6,492,294 \u201cgross sale proceeds\u201d figure. In other words, it contends that East Bank\u2019s appraisal evidence was the school board\u2019s valuation evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-9\">{\u00b6 12} We are not persuaded. Regardless of what the school board said to the BTA, the school board specifically argued <em>against </em>the $6,492,294 figure in its merit brief to this court. The school board supported only the auditor\u2019s valuations. The school board cannot argue against the validity of the $6,492,294 figure, and then claim that this court should have considered that figure as evidence of value. We therefore decline reconsideration as to the school board\u2019s second claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-10\">(\u00b6 13} Finally, the school board argues that the majority erred when it summarily accepted East Bank\u2019s $3,100,000 bulk-sale valuation without considering the validity of that valuation. The school board contends that we should have remanded this case to the BTA for an independent determination of value. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>agree. Our prior decision erred when it adopted East Bank\u2019s bulk valuation without first conducting any analysis as to whether that valuation was accurate. This court can affirmatively accept a particular valuation only if it determines that the record supports that figure. <em>Bedford Bd. of Edn. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 449, 2007-Ohio-5237, 875 N.E.2d 913, \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-5\">{\u00b6 14} Similarly, this court cannot reverse the BTA without first analyzing whether the BTA\u2019s decision was correct. R.C. 5717.04. Our appellate power over the BTA is statutorily based. <em>Id. </em>We may reverse a decision of the BTA only upon determining \u201cthat such decision of the board is unreasonable or unlawful.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In this case, the BTA explicitly rejected East Bank\u2019s $3,100,000 valuation on the grounds that Horner\u2019s bulk-sale appraisal was legally improper. 2012 WL 3166815 at *5. A majority of this court reversed the BTA and adopted Horner\u2019s valuation. <em>Dublin City Schools I, </em>139 Ohio St.3d 193, 2013-Ohio-4543, 11 N.E.3d 213, at \u00b6 27. But the majority did so without first determining that the BTA acted unreasonably or unlawfully in rejecting the bulk-sale valuation. <em>Id. </em>The majority reasoned instead that it \u201cneed not consider whether the bulk sale approach was appropriate in this instance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 27, fn. 1. Both statute and precedent contradict this approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">{\u00b6 15} Accordingly, we grant the school board\u2019s motion for reconsideration in part. We now consider whether the BTA erred in rejecting the bulk-sale valuation and whether remand would be appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-7\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b323-8\">\n<em>A. Homer\u2019s Bulk-Value Appraisal Was Inappropriate</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Az4\">{\u00b6 16} Taxing authorities must value condominium units as separate parcels, even when those units are contained in a single complex. R.C. 5311.11 (\u201cEach unit of a condominium property * * * is deemed a separate parcel for <em>all purposes of taxation and assessment </em>of real property.\u201d) (Emphasis added.) Horner\u2019s appraisal violates this legal mandate by valuing all 21 individual parcels in bulk as if they were \u201ca single economic unit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b323-9\">{\u00b6 17} In <em>Eastcreek Corp. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>8th Dist. Cuyahoga Nos. 53150-53156, 1988 WL 1544 (Jan. 7, 1988), the Eighth District Court of Appeals relied on R.C. 5311.11 in considering and invalidating a similar bulk appraisal. In <em>Eastcreek, </em>the appellee owned 30 units in a condominium complex. The owner presented evidence from an appraiser who applied \u201ca forty percent discount to each unit because all of them were owned by one entity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *1. \u201cThe rationale for this discount was that the condominiums could not be sold individually because of market conditions\u201d and could only be sold in bulk. <em>Id. </em>The court found that this bulk-discounting method violated R.C. 5311.11. As the court explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>Under the plain language of [R.C. 5311.11], each condominium unit is \u201cdeemed to be a separate parcel for all purposes of taxation and assessment of real property.\u201d The board\u2019s use of a volume discount was based on the likelihood that all of the appellee\u2019s condominiums would be sold to one buyer. This method of valuation effectively treated the appellee\u2019s condominiums as if they all were one parcel. Consequently, the use of this method of valuation was in conflict with R.C. 5311.11, and was unlawful.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-5\"><em>Id, </em>at *2.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">{\u00b6 18} Horner\u2019s appraisal fails for the same reasons. Just as in <em>Eastcreek, </em>Horner conducted a bulk valuation on the grounds that all of the condominiums were owned by one owner and \u201cthat owner [could] only sell all units at one time to one investor.\u201d Horner admittedly treated the condominiums as \u201ca single economic unit.\u201d His methodology therefore runs afoul of R.C. 5311.11, as did the appraisal in <em>Eastcreek.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b324-7\">{\u00b6 19} East Bank relies on this court\u2019s plurality decision in <em>Pingue v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>87 Ohio St.3d 62, 717 N.E.2d 293 (1999), to support the notion that a bulk-condominium appraisal is permissible. <em>Pingue, </em>however, is fundamentally distinguishable because it involved an actual sale of condominiums, not an appraisal. And our decision made no mention of R.C. 5311.11. <em>Pingue </em>does not, therefore, support East Bank\u2019s position.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">{\u00b6 20} <em>Pingue </em>dealt with the valuation of 44 identical condominium units. <em>Id. </em>at 62. The property owner had purchased all 44 units for $2,530,000, or $57,500 per unit. <em>Id. </em>He presented uncontroverted evidence that the purchase was an arms-length transaction and argued that the sale price of $57,500 per unit should establish the taxable value for each parcel. <em>Id. </em>at 63. The BTA rejected the sale price and instead looked to appraisal evidence to determine the value of each parcel. <em>Id. </em>This court reversed the BTA. We held that under former R.C. 5713.03, we were required to use the allocated sale price to establish the true taxable value of the properties. <em>Id. </em>at 64-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-9\">{\u00b6 21} <em>Pingue </em>does not support the notion that the BTA can accept bulk-appraisal evidence when determining the taxable value of condominium units. <em>Pingue </em>merely supports the notion that the law favors the use of a sale price over competing appraisal evidence. In this case, there is no actual sale price to consider. East Bank presented only an appraisal, and that appraisal violated R.C. 5311.11. <em>Pingue </em>is therefore inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-10\">{\u00b6 22} In addition to being legally impermissible, East Bank\u2019s appraisal was also inconsistent with the record. As we previously noted, Horner testified that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>the condominiums constituted a single economic unit because East Bank owned all the units and could only sell them in bulk to a single investor. He further implied that the highest and best use of the condominiums was as a single investment property, rather than individual, owner-occupied residences.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">{\u00b6 23} The record contradicts Horner\u2019s conclusions. First, despite his testimony, Horner\u2019s own appraisal report lists the highest and best use of the properties as \u201c[o]wner-occupied residential condominiums.\u201d East Bank partner George Babyak also confirmed that East Bank planned the condominium development for individual residential use. Babyak further testified that although a few out-of-state developers informally approached East Bank about purchasing all 21 units, East Bank rejected these bulk-purchase offers, preferring to market and sell the condominiums individually. By late 2011, East Bank had sold 14 of the 21 units. No bulk sale ever occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">{\u00b6 24} Horner\u2019s appraisal method, which \u201cresults in a bulk purchase value and represents what the owner would sell all of the units [for] to a single purchaser,\u201d is inconsistent with these facts. The highest and best use of the condominiums was as owner-occupied residential units. East Bank continuously marketed and sold the condominiums individually. At no point did East Bank ever list the 21 units as a bulk-sale investment property. It was therefore inappropriate for Horner to value the condominiums in bulk as if East Bank could sell them only to a single investor. The facts do not support the appraisal\u2019s \u201csingle economic unit\u201d premise.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">{\u00b6 25} Finally, East Bank\u2019s appraisal is also invalid because it does not comport with the statutory purposes of real-property taxation. County auditors are charged with assessing the \u201ctrue value\u201d of real property. R.C. 5713.01(B). \u201cTrue value\u201d means either the amount the property recently sold for on the open market or the amount of an appraisal predicting what that sale price would be. Ohio Adm.Code 5703-25-05(A); <em>Cummins Property Servs., L.L.C. v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>117 Ohio St.3d 516, 2008-Ohio-1473, 885 N.E.2d 222, \u00b6 23; <em>State ex rel. Park Invest. Co. v. Bd. of Tax Appeals, </em>175 Ohio St. 410, 412, 195 N.E.2d 908 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b325-8\">{\u00b6 26} East Bank\u2019s appraisal does not assess the \u201ctrue value\u201d of the condominium parcels for taxation purposes. Instead of predicting what the units would sell for on the open market, the appraisal predicted the units\u2019 \u201cnet present\u201d investment value. It began by valuing the condominiums \u201cin their present condition on a retail basis if sold to individuals.\u201d It then deducted \u201csales costs\u201d such as commissions, legal fees, holding costs, and property taxes. Next, it applied a 20 percent time-value-of-money discount to account for the absorption rate of the condominiums. The appraisal\u2019s final figure \u2014 $3,100,000\u2014represents \u201ca 48% discount from the retail price or total anticipated sales income.\u201d Essentially, East <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>Bank\u2019s appraisal predicted actual sale prices and then discounted those sale prices to arrive at a cash-in-hand valuation.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">{\u00b6 27} The BTA was therefore correct in rejecting East Bank\u2019s appraisal on the grounds that it \u201carrives at an investment value, rather than real market value.\u201d <em>Dublin City Schools Bd. of Edn., </em>2012 WL 3166815, at *4, citing <em>M/I Homes of Cincinnati, L.L.C. v. Warren Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>BTA No. 2009-V-3796, 2010 WL 3724159 (Sept. 21, 2010). As the BTA pointed out, this methodology may have been appropriate for a financial institution making lending decisions, but it was not an appropriate way to appraise real property for taxation purposes. 2012 WL 3166815 at *5 (\u201cwhile it may be true that, for purposes of appraising properties for financing purposes, it is appropriate to apply a bulk discount, the present matter concerns appraisal for tax valuation purposes\u201d). The appraisal openly deviated from finding the true values, or anticipated sale prices, of the condominiums. Rather, East Bank proffered an investment value that was significantly less than the predicted sale prices of the units. We cannot sanction this approach; the law mandates that we use the predicted sale prices themselves as the true taxable value of the properties. <em>Cummins </em>at \u00b6 23; Ohio Adm.Code 5703-25-05(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">{\u00b6 28} Finally, we acknowledge Horner\u2019s testimony that the appraisal\u2019s methodology comported with professional FIRREA<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and USPAP<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> guidelines. Those guidelines, however, are ultimately irrelevant in this context. Industry standards do not establish the legal parameters of real-property assessment for taxation purposes. <em>See, e.g., HIN, L.L.C. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>138 Ohio St.3d 223, 2014-Ohio-523, 5 N.E.3d 637, \u00b6 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">{\u00b6 29} For all these reasons, the BTA did not err in rejecting East Bank\u2019s bulk-value-appraisal methodology in this case. The methodology contradicted R.C. 5311.11, the facts of this case, and the statutory goals of real-property assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">\n<em>B. Rather Than Revert to the Auditor\u2019s Valuations, the BTA Should Have Independently Determined the Value of the Properties</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b326-9\">{\u00b630} After it considered and rejected East Bank\u2019s arguments, the BTA reinstated the auditor\u2019s valuations for each parcel. <em>Dublin City Schools Bd. of Edn., </em>2012 WL 3166815, at *6. In this court\u2019s prior opinion, we held that the BTA erred in reverting to the auditor\u2019s valuations. <em>Dublin City Schools I, </em>139 Ohio St.3d 193, 2013-Ohio-4543, 11 N.E.3d 213, at \u00b626. That portion of our prior decision remains unchanged.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>{\u00b6 31} Rather than adopt the auditor\u2019s valuations, the BTA should have conducted its own analysis and made an independent determination as to the taxable values of the properties. <em>See, e.g., Vandalia-Butler City Schools Bd. of Edn. v. Montgomery Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>130 Ohio St.3d 291, 2011-Ohio-5078, 958 N.E.2d 131, \u00b6 26 (\u201cWhen there is sufficient evidence to permit the BTA to perform an independent valuation * * * the BTA must do so\u201d); <em>Colonial Village, Ltd. v.

If necessary, the BTA may order the presentation of additional evidence to assist with this determination. R.C. 5717.01; <em>Columbus City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>90 Ohio St.3d 564, 567, 740 N.E.2d 276 (2001) (remanding to the BTA for an independent determination of value and noting that under R.C. 5717.01, the BTA \u201c \u2018may order the hearing of additional evidence, and may make such investigation concerning the appeal as it deems proper\u2019 \u201d). Accordingly, we remand this case to the BTA so that it may conduct an independent valuation for the properties in question. <em>See Colonial Village </em>at \u00b6 1 (ordering remand for the BTA to conduct an independent valuation of the property after the BTA had unlawfully upheld the auditor\u2019s valuation); <em>Vandalia-Butler </em>at \u00b6 27 (remanding because the BTA did not conduct an independent analysis of value).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">{\u00b6 32} Upon partial reconsideration of our prior decision, we find that the BTA correctly rejected East Bank\u2019s bulk-value appraisal for the 21 condominium units and we therefore affirm that portion of the BTA\u2019s decision. East Bank\u2019s appraisal violated real-property-assessment statutes and was otherwise unsupported by the facts in the record. The BTA erred, however, in reverting to the auditor\u2019s determinations of value. The BTA should have independently determined the taxable values of the 21 properties in question. We remand this case to the BTA so that it may perform that independent valuation.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">Motion for reconsideration granted in part, decision affirmed in part and reversed in part, and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b327-8\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Lanzinger and O\u2019Neill, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"AEt\">Pfeifer, O\u2019Donnell, and Kennedy, JJ., dissent in part.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b326-10\">.

Here, East Bank presented expert evidence of a $3,100,000 valuation, and the Dublin City Schools Board of Education failed to present any evidence supporting a different valuation and thus failed to meet its burden of proof on appeal to the BTA. Moreover, because evidence in the record negated the auditor\u2019s valuation of the property, the BTA acted unreasonably and unlawfully by reverting to that valuation instead of conducting its own independent valuation based upon the evidence in the record. Accordingly, I would adopt East Bank\u2019s evidence and establish the 2008 valuation as $3,100,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">\n<em>Factual Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">{\u00b6 34} This case involves the property valuation of 21 condominium units that remained unfinished to varying degrees as of the 2008 tax lien date. The Franklin County auditor assessed the true value of each of the 21 units and determined that the aggregate value of the units for the tax year 2008 was $8,139,300. East Bank filed complaints with the board of revision challenging the auditor\u2019s valuation of the property, and the board of education filed countercomplaints seeking retention of the auditor\u2019s valuation.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">{\u00b6 35} At the board of revision hearing, the only evidence regarding valuation came from East Bank. In addition to the testimony of East Bank\u2019s managing partner, East Bank presented the testimony and appraisal report of Thomas Horner, who opined that the 21 units had a \u201cnet present market value\u201d or \u201cas-is value\u201d of $3,100,000. To arrive at this value, Horner conducted a comparable sales analysis and then deducted the estimated cost to finish the remaining units. This analysis yielded \u201cgross sale proceeds\u201d of $6,492,294. Because he considered the 21 units as a \u201csingle economic unit\u201d due to the facts that they are \u201cowned by one owner\u201d and \u201c[tjhat owner can only sell all units at one time to one investor,\u201d he applied a \u201cbulk discount\u201d to arrive at an estimated value of $3,100,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">{\u00b6 36} Although counsel for the school board cross-examined East Bank\u2019s managing partner, the school board did not present any witnesses or additional evidence regarding the value of the property at the board of revision hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-10\">{\u00b6 37} The board of revision adopted Horner\u2019s valuation of $3,100,000 as the total fair market value for the 21 units, noting, \u201cWe were given no additional information on behalf of the county complainant school board in this matter, and * * * we recognize Mr. Horner as being an expert in the area of real estate appraisal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b328-11\">{\u00b6 38} The school board appealed the board of revision\u2019s decision to the BTA. At the BTA hearing, however, the school board failed to present any witnesses or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>any evidence supporting its valuation or the auditor\u2019s valuation. East Bank presented the testimony of its managing partner and Horner, who offered additional data from condominium sales occurring after the tax lien date and retrospectively concluded that a revised cash flow analysis yielded a value of $2,900,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">{\u00b6 39} After its review, the BTA reversed the board of revision\u2019s adjustments and reinstated the auditor\u2019s valuation of the 21 units, determining that Horner\u2019s use of the bulk discount was improper and concluding that East Bank \u201cfailed to present competent and probative evidence to either this board or the BOR in support of its requested decreases in value.\u201d <em>Dublin City Schools Bd. of Edn. v.

Franklin Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>139 Ohio St.3d 193, 2013-Ohio-4543, 11 N.E.3d 209-10, \u00b6 15 <em>{\u201cDublin City Schools I\u201d), </em>citing <em>Columbus City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>90 Ohio St.3d 564, 566, 740 N.E.2d 276 (2001). We further explained that when the board of revision adopted East Bank\u2019s valuation, the burden of presenting \u201ccompetent and probative evidence\u201d supporting a different valuation shifted to the board of education on appeal to the BTA. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 16. However, we determined that the board of education failed to meet its burden in this case, because it did not present any evidence to support its own valuation or the auditor\u2019s valuation. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">{\u00b6 41} Moreover, we determined that \u201cthe BTA\u2019s reinstatement of the auditor\u2019s valuation was \u2018not justified, because the taxpayer had presented evidence contrary to the auditor\u2019s determination to the board of revision.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 21, quoting <em>Bedford Bd. of Edn. v.

Specifically, we noted that \u201cthere is no evidence indicating that the auditor accounted for the unfinished state of the units or the units\u2019 depreciation in value due to market conditions, and the historical sales evidence provided by East Bank further contradicts the auditor\u2019s valuation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, we concluded that \u201c[w]hen confronted with such clear evidence negating the auditor\u2019s valuation, the BTA acted unreasonably and unlawfully in adopting the auditor\u2019s valuation rather than determining the taxable value of the property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">{\u00b6 42} Determining that the school board did not present any evidence before the board of revision or the BTA, that the evidence in the record negated the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>auditor\u2019s valuation, and that the BTA acted unreasonably and unlawfully in failing to conduct its own independent valuation despite sufficient evidence in the record to do so, we reversed the decision of the BTA and established the 2008 valuation as $3,100,000 in accordance with the only evidence of valuation contained in the record as presented by East Bank\u2019s expert. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 27. We further explained, \u201cWe need not consider whether the bulk sale approach was appropriate in this instance because we determine that the BTA acted unreasonably and unlawfully in not conducting its own independent valuation of the property taking into account the unfinished state of some, if not all, of the units, the depreciation in value, and the sales history.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at fn. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">\n<em>Reconsideration</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">{\u00b6 43} Instead of determining whether the BTA erred in rejecting the bulk sale valuation and remanding the cause, I would reinstate the valuation of $3,100,000 based upon East Bank\u2019s evidence of value and the board of education\u2019s failure to present any evidence supporting a different valuation.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">{\u00b6 44} In <em>Bedford, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 449, 2007-Ohio-5237, 875 N.E.2d 913, a case involving the valuation of an improved parcel of land that was one of several parcels in a strip mall, <em>id. </em>at \u00b6 1, we concluded that the BTA\u2019s reinstatement of the auditor\u2019s valuation was not justified, because the property owner presented evidence contradicting the auditor\u2019s determination to the board of revision and the school board\u2019s evidence before the BTA \u201cdid not amount to independent evidence of value that would undermine the BOR\u2019s determination\u201d nor did it \u201csupport reinstating the auditor\u2019s valuation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 12-13. We further explained that we did \u201cnot need to remand the cause to the BTA, because the BOR\u2019s determination comports with the evidence in the record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-7\">{\u00b6 45} Similarly, in my view, we do not need to remand this matter to the BTA, because East Bank provided expert evidence supporting the value of $3,100,000 and the school board had the opportunity \u2014 and the burden \u2014 to present evidence supporting a different valuation on appeal to the BTA but failed to do so. Considering that the parties had \u201cample opportunity to present evidence,\u201d they should not be given another chance to present additional evidence on remand. <em>Worthington City Schools Bd. of Edn. v.

Zeiger, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">{\u00b6 46} Moreover, the BTA acted unreasonably and unlawfully in reinstating the auditor\u2019s valuation, because the evidence in the record contradicted that valuation and there was sufficient evidence in the record from which the BTA could independently determine value. <em>Dublin City Schools I, </em>139 Ohio St.3d 193, 2013-Ohio-4543, 11 N.E.2d 211-12, 213, at \u00b6 21, 26. The BTA should have conducted an independent determination of value based on the evidence in the record in the first instance, and for that reason I dissent from the majority\u2019s decision to \u201cremand this case to the BTA so that it may conduct an independent valuation for the properties in question.\u201d Majority opinion at \u00b6 31. A remand in this situation prolongs even further the determination of value in a case involving a 2008 tax lien date.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">{\u00b6 47} Accordingly, I would reverse the determination of the BTA and, in light of the school board\u2019s failure to satisfy its burden and provide evidence supporting a different valuation, I would establish the 2008 valuation at $3,100,000 in accordance with the evidence presented in this case.</p>\n<judges id=\"b331-6\">Pfeifer and Kennedy, JJ., concur in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
