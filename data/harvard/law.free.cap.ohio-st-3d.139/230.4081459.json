On May 21, 2012, relator, disciplinary counsel, filed a complaint against Bukstein with the Board on the Unauthorized Practice of Law. That complaint alleged that Bukstein engaged in the unauthorized practice of law by providing legal advice, drafting a motion for a party to sign pro se, and sending communications demanding discovery and making legal arguments on behalf of parties in two domestic-relations cases. In her answer, Bukstein admitted that she engaged in some of the alleged conduct, but argued that she acted as a \u201ccivil rights advocate,\u201d not as an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-12\">{\u00b6 2} A panel of the board conducted a hearing on April 11, 2013, but Bukstein was not present. Based on the testimony of two witnesses, the deposition testimony of a third witness, and ten exhibits submitted by relator, the panel issued findings of fact and conclusions of law and determined that Bukstein had engaged in the unauthorized practice of law as charged in the complaint. The panel recommended that we enjoin Bukstein from committing further illegal acts and assess a $20,000 civil penalty against her. The board adopted the panel\u2019s findings and recommended penalty. Neither party has filed objections to the board\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-13\">{\u00b6 3} We agree that Bukstein engaged in the unauthorized practice of law and that an injunction is warranted. However, we conclude that her conduct does not warrant the imposition of the maximum civil penalty permitted by Gov.Bar R. VII(8)(B), and we therefore reduce the board\u2019s recommended penalty of $20,000 to $10,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>Unauthorized Practice of Law</p>\n<p id=\"b339-5\">{\u00b6 4} The unauthorized practice of law is \u201c[t]he rendering of legal services for another by any person not admitted to practice in Ohio.\u201d Gov.Bar R. VII(2)(A)(1); <em>Cleveland Bar Assn. v. Pearlman, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 136, 2005-Ohio-4107, 832 N.E.2d 1193, \u00b6 7. The practice of law \u201cembraces the preparation of pleadings and other papers incident to actions and special proceedings and the management of such actions and proceedings on behalf of clients before judges and courts, * * * and in general all advice to clients and all action taken for them in matters connected with the law.\u201d <em>Land Title Abstract &amp; Trust Co. v. Dworken, </em>129 Ohio St. 23, 193 N.E. 650 (1934), paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-6\">{\u00b6 5} In her answer, Bukstein admitted that she is not an attorney. She is not admitted to the practice of law in Ohio pursuant to Gov.Bar R. I, nor is she registered pursuant to Gov.Bar R. VI or certified pursuant to Gov.Bar R. II, IX, or XI. She described herself as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b339-7\">a Civil Rights Advocate from Minnesota that works on cases all over the nation. Ms. Bukstein specializes in ethics issues arising in litigation and government agencies. Finding innovative solutions to complex problems, Ms. Bukstein supports the rights of everyone regardless of position or circumstance and helps legal professionals and public officials identify and repair problems.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b339-8\">{\u00b6 6} Although Bukstein identified herself as a civil-rights advocate rather than an attorney and claimed that she did not receive a fee for her services, the board found that her activities on behalf of two women in their respective domestic-relations proceedings crossed the line into the unauthorized practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-9\">The Melinda Polen Matter</p>\n<p id=\"b339-10\">{\u00b6 7} Judge Thomas J. Capper presided over Melinda Polen\u2019s divorce case in the Clark County Court of Common Pleas, Domestic Relations Division. Judge Capper testified that he first met Bukstein in March 2011, when she attended a postdecree hearing and sat at the counsel table with Polen. He stated that Bukstein identified herself as a civil-rights advocate and complied with his request that she move from the counsel table because she was not an attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-11\">{\u00b6 8} Judge Capper testified that Polen\u2019s behavior changed and the case took a dramatic turn downward after Bukstein got involved. He reported that Bukstein\u2019s interviews with the parties\u2019 son who has special needs caused the child to become uncomfortable and distrustful of Polen. He also recalled that Polen\u2019s attorney withdrew from the case as a result of Bukstein\u2019s interference.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>{\u00b6 9} While Polen filed some pleadings pro se, Judge Capper reported that she seemed unfamiliar with their content when he questioned her about them in court. This fact, together with his awareness of Bukstein\u2019s involvement in the case, led him to believe that it was Bukstein who had drafted the pleadings.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">{\u00b6 10} The board found Judge Capper\u2019s testimony to be credible and found that Bukstein engaged in the unauthorized practice of law by providing legal advice; drafting a motion for a party to sign pro se; sending communications on behalf of another in which she made legal arguments; and appearing in court, sitting at the counsel table, and identifying herself to the judge as a civil-rights advocate.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-6\">{\u00b6 11} In addition to the testimony of Judge Capper, six exhibits relating to the Polen matter were admitted into evidence, including a copy of a motion for reallocation of parental rights and responsibilities that had been filed pro se by Polen. Attached to that motion are at least 19 documents, including the exhibits, e-mails, letters, and formal complaints that Bukstein had prepared and submitted on Polen\u2019s behalf to the Ohio Board of Nursing; the superintendent of the Northwestern School District; the Ohio Counselor, Social Worker and Marriage &amp; Family Therapist Board; the Ohio auditor of state; and Senator Sherrod Brown, as well as an annotated list summarizing the content of those documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">{\u00b6 12} In her answer to relator\u2019s complaint, Bukstein admitted that she authored several of those documents and presented a brief summary of their content. A review of those documents reveals that Bukstein filed a grievance with the Ohio Board of Nursing against the current wife of Polen\u2019s ex-husband. She also corresponded with the school district superintendent, demanding that Polen receive access to her child\u2019s parent-teacher conferences. But rather than simply stating the facts of the alleged misconduct or inquiring about the school district\u2019s policies, she made legal arguments in the documents seeking to vindicate Polen\u2019s statutory and constitutional rights and to advance her custody case by silencing her critics. These are not the actions of a person seeking systemic reform of the legal system- \u2014 -they are the actions of a person advising and advocating for another on issues of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-8\">{\u00b6 13} In an affidavit filed with the domestic-relations court just one minute after Polen\u2019s motion, Bukstein averred that she was assisting Polen\u2019s access to justice, serving as a neutral third-party observer and a friend of the court, and bringing attention to situations in which Polen\u2019s rights had been denied. Bukstein argued that Polen had been \u201cdenied due process and kept from remedy and resolution,\u201d compared the facts of Polen\u2019s case to the facts giving rise to a fraud and corruption investigation of California\u2019s family courts, and claimed that she had \u201caccomplished a great deal\u201d in Polen\u2019s domestic-relations case. Bukstein also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>attached an annotated list of exhibits to her affidavit that was identical to the one that was submitted with Polen\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">{\u00b6 14} In a later pro se motion, Polen asked the court to dismiss or deny her ex-husband\u2019s motion for attorney fees and to award her custody of their minor child on the ground that the court\u2019s prior orders were void ab initio because the judge\u2019s signatures on them were forged.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">{\u00b6 15} Attached to that motion was a letter on Bukstein\u2019s letterhead and signed by Bukstein making the same argument and further alleging that Polen\u2019s ex-husband obtained custody of the child by fraud and a sham legal process, in violation of R.C. 2921.52 and Polen\u2019s constitutional rights. That letter refers to complaints that Bukstein filed with the Ohio State Bar Association against the ex-husband (who is an attorney), Judge Capper, Polen\u2019s former counsel, and Douglas Geyer, counsel for the ex-husband, and suggests that if any of those attorneys would support the restoration of Polen\u2019s rights, \u201cI would be inclined to drop the complaint against that attorney. After all that is something that is well within my power.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-7\">{\u00b6 16} Also attached to Polen\u2019s March 15, 2012 motion was an e-mail that Bukstein had sent to Polen and her counsel, David MeNamee, the day before, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-8\">Melinda,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-9\">This email is to confirm our conversation just now since you are at work and this needs to be communicated immediately.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-10\">1. That you are working on putting together a pro se motion and should have that ready by tomorrow.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-11\">2. That MeNamee had better not file that continuance because you do not agree, <em>(if he files that behind your back without your permission I\u2019ll file yet another BAR complaint about his </em>stunt)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-12\">3. McNamee\u2019s [sic] has not sent you anything yet nor can we see anything filed from him in the on line docket. I\u2019ll call the court today and ask if he has. Also let them know MeNamee dumped you as his client and if he files is [sic] notice to with draw [sic] that\u2019s fine but to not accept that continuance at least not yet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-13\">This is to document.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-14\">(Emphasis and boldface sic.)</p>\n<p id=\"b341-15\">{\u00b6 17} Comparing these motions and documents, it is evident that Bukstein advised Polen, assisted her in preparing the legal arguments in her case, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>advanced those arguments on Polen\u2019s behalf in correspondence intimately related to her domestic-relations case. Our precedent is clear: \u201cThe practice of law is not limited to appearances in court. It also embraces the preparation of papers that are to be filed in court on another\u2019s behalf and that are otherwise incident to a lawsuit.\u201d <em>Toledo Bar Assn. v. Joelson, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 425, 2007-Ohio-4272, 872 N.E.2d 1207, \u00b6 6. Therefore, we accept the board\u2019s finding that Bukstein engaged in the unauthorized practice of law in the Polen matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">The Christine Tibbitts Matter</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">{\u00b6 18} Glen Tibbitts testified that in May and June 2011, he began to receive communications from Bukstein by e-mail, mail, and phone regarding parenting time and financial issues that had been addressed and resolved by the Delaware County Court of Common Pleas, Domestic Relations Division, in his divorce from his former wife, Christine Tibbitts. One of Bukstein\u2019s written communications stated that \u201cwhat had been ordered by the court could not be done.\u201d According to Mr. Tibbitts, on June 14, 2011, Bukstein called him \u201cspeaking in legalese\u201d and seeking to modify the court-ordered visitation schedule. Based on her communications, he believed that she was a civil-rights attorney representing his former wife in an attempt to modify the terms of their divorce decree. He testified that Bukstein\u2019s actions caused him anxiety, sleepless nights, nightmares, and emotional distress due to the fear that he would lose sole custody of his daughter. Mr. Tibbitts contacted his attorney and the Delaware County prosecutor in an effort to stop Bukstein\u2019s communications. His attorney, William L. Geary, was not available to testify at the panel hearing, but relator caused his deposition testimony to be read into the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">{\u00b6 19} Geary testified that Bukstein sent him an e-mail on June 9, 2011, regarding his failure to respond to questions and previous discovery requests allegedly submitted to him by Ms. Tibbitts. In that e-mail, Bukstein advised Geary that it was important for him to respond to these requests because he had a duty to respond to opposing counsel and Ms. Tibbitts was a \u201cpro se attorney of record.\u201d Bukstein alleged that Geary\u2019s actions raised an attorney-misconduct issue and stated that as a civil-rights advocate, she addressed such issues by filing complaints with the bar association. She also informed him that she had already filed a complaint against the attorney who served as the guardian ad litem for the Tibbittses\u2019 son. The board found the testimony of Mr. Tibbitts and Geary to be credible.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">{\u00b620} The board determined that by characterizing herself as a civil-rights advocate, Bukstein held herself out as an expert and person worthy of trust in matters of law and that this misrepresentation induced Polen and Ms. Tibbitts to rely on her unauthorized and unqualified legal advice \u2014 to their detriment and the detriment of other parties to the litigation. It also concluded that she engaged in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>the unauthorized practice of law by sending communications that made legal arguments and demanded discovery on behalf of others and by sending correspondence threatening to file disciplinary complaints or legal actions on behalf of others to coerce the recipients to cooperate in legal matters.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We agree and accept the board\u2019s finding that Bukstein engaged in the unauthorized practice of law in the Tibbitts matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">{\u00b6 21} Having found that Bukstein engaged in the unauthorized practice of law, we accept the board\u2019s recommendation that we issue an injunction prohibiting her from giving legal advice to others, pr\u00e9paring or assisting in the preparation of legal documents for others, sending communications making legal arguments or demanding discovery on behalf of others, sending correspondence threatening to file disciplinary complaints or legal actions on behalf of others, and engaging in all other acts constituting the practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">{\u00b6 22} We also accept the board\u2019s recommendation that we impose a civil penalty. Gov.Bar R. VII(8)(B) provides that \u201c[t]he Board may recommend and the Supreme Court may impose civil penalties in an amount up to ten thousand dollars per offense.\u201d Gov.Bar R. VII(19)(D)(l)(c) authorizes this court to impose a civil penalty \u201cfor an amount greater or less than the amount recommended by the Board, but not to exceed ten thousand dollars per offense.\u201d The board recommends that we impose a $20,000 civil penalty \u2014 the maximum penalty of $10,000 for each of the matters in which Bukstein engaged in the unauthorized practice of law. Having independently weighed the misconduct here, the relevant factors in Gov.Bar R. VII(8)(B), and our precedent, however, we conclude that the appropriate civil penalty is $5,000 for each matter \u2014 $10,000 total \u2014 for Bukstein\u2019s unauthorized practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">{\u00b6 23} Gov.Bar R. VII(8)(B) sets forth five factors to consider in imposing a civil penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">{\u00b6 24} (1) Degree of cooperation. Bukstein initially cooperated with relator\u2019s investigation. She corresponded with relator and the panel before her hearing and attempted to answer relator\u2019s pleadings. She has never admitted that her actions constituted the unauthorized practice of law, nor has she agreed to be enjoined from engaging in the unauthorized practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>{\u00b6 25} The board found that Bukstein repeatedly disregarded its instructions regarding filing and communication with the panel, sent harassing and potentially threatening e-mails to individual members of the panel, and made threats to file numerous complaints with various government agencies against the individual panel members and disciplinary counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">{\u00b6 26} Just before the start of the initially scheduled panel hearing, Bukstein\u2019s husband requested and received a continuance of the final hearing in this matter based on her reported hospitalization. Bukstein received by certified mail a final amended scheduling order stating the date, time, and location of the new hearing date, which advised the parties that no further continuances would be granted. Nonetheless, her husband sought another continuance two days before the hearing date, which the panel denied, and the hearing proceeded in her absence.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">{\u00b6 27} (2) The number of occasions that the unauthorized practice of law was committed. Bukstein engaged in multiple acts of the unauthorized practice of law in each of the two counts charged in this case. The board also found that there was evidence of persistent, systematic, and continuing occurrences in which Bukstein held herself out to others as a civil-rights advocate with a special knowledge of the domestic-relations-court system and ethics laws regarding attorneys and judges. But the board cites no specific evidence in support of these conclusions. And while we acknowledge that Bukstein\u2019s filings and correspondence at issue in this case claimed that she possessed specialized knowledge in ethics issues arising in litigation and government agencies and that she worked in cases all over the nation, we find no evidence that that she solicited any additional \u201cclients\u201d or held herself out as an expert in legal ethics in any other matters within this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">{\u00b6 28} (3) and (4) Flagrancy of the violations and harm to third parties. Bukstein offered legal advice to Polen and Ms. Tibbitts but refused to acknowledge it as such. The board emphasized that Bukstein\u2019s conduct harmed these two women, who relied on her advice to their detriment, harmed other parties in the litigation (including Polen\u2019s child) who were distressed and inconvenienced by her actions, and undermined public confidence in the judicial system. But from the record before us, it is unclear whether anyone suffered any lasting harm as a result of Bukstein\u2019s involvement in these matters. Indeed, neither of the women she attempted to assist has participated in this proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">{\u00b6 29} (5) Other relevant factors. The board\u2019s regulations list additional aggravating and mitigating factors that may be considered as part of this final catchall factor of Gov.Bar R. VII(8)(B). UPL Reg. 400(F). In aggravation, the board found that (1) both Judge Capper and attorney Geary had separately notified Bukstein that her actions might constitute the unauthorized practice of law, (2) she assisted parties in the preparation of legal instruments and filings <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>and prepared a motion that was filed with the court in the Polen matter, and (3) by referring to herself as a \u201ccivil rights advocate\u201d and by citing statutes, attempting to interpret legal authority, and contacting opposing counsel, opposing parties, and the court in a representative fashion, she has allowed others to mistakenly believe that she was admitted to practice law in this state. <em>See </em>UPL Reg. 400(F)(3)(c) (whether the respondent has been informed prior to engaging in the unauthorized practice of law that the conduct at issue might constitute an act of the unauthorized practice of law), (f) (whether respondent\u2019s conduct included the preparation of a legal instrument for filing with a court or other governmental entity), and (g) (whether the respondent has held herself out as being admitted to the practice of law in the state of Ohio or whether she has allowed others to mistakenly believe that she was admitted to practice in this state). The only mitigating factor that the board found applicable was that Bukstein\u2019s conduct appears to have resulted from motives other than dishonesty or personal benefit. <em>See </em>UPL Reg. 400(F)(4)(e).</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Ax5A\">Scott J. Drexel, Disciplinary Counsel, and Stacy Solochek Beckman, Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AHQ\">Kimberley Bukstein, pro se.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">{\u00b6 30} Having weighed these factors, the board recommends that we impose the maximum civil penalty of $10,000 for each of the two counts in which Bukstein has engaged in the unauthorized practice of law. Because Bukstein\u2019s conduct is not on par with the most egregious acts that we have found to constitute the unauthorized practice of law, however, we conclude that a lesser civil penalty is warranted. <em>See, e.g., Cleveland Metro. Bar Assn. v. McGinnis, </em>137 Ohio St.3d 166, 2013-Ohio-4581, 998 N.E.2d 474, \u00b6 14-15. Based on Bukstein\u2019s multiple acts of unauthorized practice of law in the Polen and Tibbitts matters, we find that the appropriate civil penalty is $5,000 for each ease in which she engaged in the unauthorized practice of law, for a total of $10,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">{\u00b6 31} Accordingly, we enjoin Kimberley Bukstein from engaging in any further acts that constitute the unauthorized practice of law, and we impose a civil penalty of $10,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">{\u00b6 32} Costs are taxed to Bukstein.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b345-9\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Kennedy, French, and O\u2019Neill, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b343-10\">. The board also found that Bukstein had identified herself as a \u201cpro se attorney of record\u201d and had stated that opposing counsel in the Tibbitts matter had a duty to respond to her as \u201copposing counsel.\u201d The record shows, however, that Bukstein had identified Christine Tibbitts as pro se attorney of record and had stated that attorney Geary had a duty to respond to Ms. Tibbitts as opposing counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
