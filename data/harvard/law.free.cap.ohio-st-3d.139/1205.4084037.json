Wilson, a retired judge sitting by assignment, from presiding over any further proceedings in case No. 13-04-0084, now pending for trial in the Court of Common Pleas of Logan County.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-14\">{\u00b6 2} Harrison claims that Judge Wilson is prejudiced against him and \u201chas an interest in making sure [Harrison is] convicted\u201d in the underlying case. Harrison, however, filed his affidavit with the clerk on March 24, 2014, the day before the scheduled trial. Under R.C. 2701.03(B), an affidavit of disqualification must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1206\">*1206</page-number>be filed \u201cnot less than seven calendar days before the day on which the next hearing in the proceeding is scheduled.\u201d This statutory deadline may be set aside only \u201cwhen compliance with the provision is impossible,\u201d such as when the alleged bias or prejudice occurs fewer than seven days before the hearing date or the case is scheduled or assigned to a judge within seven days of the next hearing. <em>In re Disqualification of Leskovyansky, </em>88 Ohio St.3d 1210, 723 N.E.2d 1099 (1999). Harrison claims that he did not file his affidavit earlier because he had filed a grievance against the judge, which he thought had the same effect as an affidavit of disqualification. Harrison\u2019s mistaken views about the affidavit-of-disqualification process do not excuse his late filing of the affidavit in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-4\">{\u00b6 3} Accordingly, Harrison has not set forth a sufficient basis for setting aside the seven-day filing requirement in R.C. 2701.03, and his affidavit of disqualification is therefore dismissed as untimely.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
