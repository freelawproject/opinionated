For the reasons explained below, we affirm Mammone\u2019s convictions and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-11\">I. CASE HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b575-12\">{\u00b6 2} On June 17, 2009, Mammone was indicted on three counts of aggravated murder (R.C. 2903.01), one with a firearm specification (R.C. 2941.145); two counts of aggravated burglary (R.C. 2911.11(A)), each with a firearm specification; violating a protection order (R.C. 2919.27(A)(1)); and attempted arson (R.C. 2923.02(A) and 2909.03(A)(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b575-13\">{\u00b6 3} Each aggravated-murder count carried two death specifications. Count One, involving Margaret\u2019s murder, included a course-of-conduct specification (R.C. 2929.04(A)(5)) and a specification for committing her murder in the course of an aggravated burglary (R.C. 2929.04(A)(7)). Counts Three and Four charged Mammone with the aggravated murders of Macy and James, and each included a course-of-conduct specification and a child-murder specification (R.C. 2929.04(A)(9)). Mammone pled not guilty to all counts and specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-14\">{\u00b6 4} Before trial, defense counsel filed, among other motions, a motion for a change of venue based on excessive pretrial publicity and a motion in limine to exclude all victim photographs at trial. After a hearing, the trial court denied Mammone\u2019s motion to change venue as premature but indicated that the motion could be renewed at a later date. The court held a separate hearing on the motion in limine and denied the motion as premature. The court at a later hearing preliminarily approved the photos that the state planned to introduce as evidence but invited further argument about specific photos at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>A. The State\u2019s Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"ApDm\">\n<em>1. Testimony of Marcia Eakin and Other Witnesses</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">{\u00b6 5} Mammone\u2019s trial began on January 11, 2010. The state called Mammone\u2019s ex-wife, Marcia Eakin, to testify. Marcia testified about the breakdown of her relationship with Mammone and stated that she first told Mammone in August 2007 that she intended to leave him. On that day, Mammone stayed home from work and refused to let her or their two children, Macy and James IV, leave the family\u2019s Canton residence. Mammone broke Marcia\u2019s cell phone and took all the house phones. She did not leave him that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">{\u00b6 6} Marcia and Mammone sought counseling, but she did not feel that the marital relationship improved. She testified that Mammone threatened her, warning that \u201cif I tried to leave he would kill me and the children.\u201d Unbeknownst to Mammone, Marcia contacted a lawyer to initiate the process of filing for divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">{\u00b6 7} On June 13, 2008, Mammone learned that Marcia was seeking a divorce when he intercepted a call from Marcia\u2019s lawyer. According to Marcia, Mammone again threatened to kill her, declaring: \u201cI told you if you tried to leave me I was going to kill you.\u201d He told Macy and James on that date that \u201cit was time for mommy to go to her grave.\u201d Mammone did not let Marcia or the children out of his sight for the rest of the day.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-7\">{\u00b6 8} Marcia explained that she and the children managed to get away from Mammone, and she sought a civil protection order against him. On July 10, 2008, the Stark County Common Pleas Court issued a two-year protection order requiring Mammone to stay more than 500 feet away from Marcia. He was permitted only supervised contact with the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-8\">{\u00b6 9} Marcia testified that the Mammones\u2019 divorce was finalized in April 2009. Under the final divorce decree, Mammone was permitted overnight visitation with the children four times a month and evening visitation twice a week. Marcia explained that Mammone picked up and dropped off the children at the home of her parents, Margaret and Jim Eakin, so that Mammone would not have direct contact with Marcia or know where she lived. During visits, Mammone was permitted to text Marcia about matters pertaining to the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-9\">{\u00b6 10} Marcia testified that on Sunday, June 7, 2009, Mammone picked up five-year-old Macy and three-year-old James at the Eakins\u2019 home for a scheduled overnight visit. Mammone was driving his green BMW.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-10\">{\u00b6 11} Marcia met a friend, Ben Carter, to play tennis and have dinner. At 4:25 p.m., Mammone began to text Marcia. Although the two never spoke that night, they exchanged dozens of text messages over the next 15 hours, and records of these messages were introduced at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>{\u00b6 12} At first, Mammone sought advice about consoling Macy, who was upset. But he quickly shifted to blaming Marcia for the children\u2019s suffering, texting: \u201cHow long are we going to let these children that you * * * had to have suffer?\u201d Throughout the evening Mammone repeatedly texted Marcia, accusing her of \u201cruin[ing] lives\u201d by putting herself first. He admonished her to put her children first and demanded to know what was more important than the kids at that moment. Marcia replied by texting that Mammone should \u201cstop tormenting\u201d the children. No fewer than five times, she offered to have Mammone return the children to her mother\u2019s house or asked if she could meet him to pick up the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">{\u00b6 13} Mammone advised Marcia in a text that he was \u201cat [the] point of no return\u201d and that he \u201crefuse[d] to let gov restrict my right as a man to fight for the family you promised me.\u201d At 9:11 p.m., he warned Marcia that \u201csafe and good do not apply to this night my love.\u201d Marcia promptly responded, texting: \u201cDo not hurt them.\u201d At 9:35 p.m., she asked him to \u201c[k]eep them safe.\u201d Mammone texted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b577-7\">You got five minutes to call me back on the phone. I am not fucking around. I have stashed a bunch of pain killers for this nigh[t] * * * i hope u would never let happen. I have put on my wedding band, my fav shirt and I am ready to die for my love tonight. I am high as a kite * * * bring o[n] the hail of bullets if need be.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">{\u00b6 14} At this point, Marcia called 9-1-1. The state played a recording of the call at trial. On the recording, Marcia advised the 9-1-1 operator that her children were in a car with her ex-husband, who had threatened to take \u201ca bunch of painkillers\u201d and had said that he was \u201cready to die tonight.\u201d While Marcia was on the line with the 9-1-1 operator, the operator attempted to call Mammone, but he would not answer his phone. After speaking to the 9-1-1 operator, Marcia texted Mammone that she would not call him (in accordance with the operator\u2019s advice), and again urged him to \u201ckeep the kids safe.\u201d At 10:18 p.m., Marcia in a text to Mammone asked him to meet her so that she could pick up the kids. Marcia\u2019s friend Carter confirmed that he and Marcia then drove around looking for Mammone.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-9\">{\u00b6 15} Marcia testified that she then contacted both Mammone\u2019s mother and the wife of Richard Hull, Mammone\u2019s friend and former employer. Phone records indicate that Richard Hull began to text Mammone, advising him to calm down and keep the kids safe. Hull\u2019s texts suggested that Mammone should drop the kids off with Mammone\u2019s mother. Hull testified that he and his father also drove around for a time looking for Mammone but did not find him.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>{\u00b6 16} At 2:00 a.m. on June 8, Mammone sent a text to Marcia, stating, \u201cI am not one who accepts divorce. * * * I married you for love and for life * * At 2:36 a.m., he wrote, \u201cI am so dead inside without u. The children r painful * * * [reminders of what I have lost of myself. This situation is beyond tolerable. So what happens next?\u201d At 2:50 a.m., Mammone reiterated in a text' to Marcia that the love of his children was \u201conly a source of pain\u201d without her love.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">{\u00b6 17} Hull testified that around 3:00 a.m., he spoke to Marcia and decided not to go back out looking for Mammone because they were hopeful that everything would be fine. Marcia attempted to end her text conversation with Mammone, writing, \u201cPleasef ] keep kids safe good night.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">{\u00b6 18} At 5:34 a.m., Mammone texted Marcia: \u201cLast chance. Here it goes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b578-8\">{\u00b6 19} One of the Eakins\u2019 neighbors, Edward Roth, testified that around 5:30 a.m., he heard gunshots and screaming through his open bedroom window. Roth said that he saw a goldish-tan-colored car leaving the Eakin residence and several minutes later saw the same car returning to the street to sit in the middle of the intersection near the house. Roth called 9-1-1. A law-enforcement officer testified that he and another officer arrived to find Margaret Eakin lying severely injured on the floor of a second-floor bedroom. The officers observed two shell casings and a broken lamp.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-9\">{\u00b6 20} Marcia testified that she heard a car roar up her driveway around 5:40 a.m. From a second-floor bedroom window, she saw Mammone get out of the car and empty a red gasoline container onto Carter\u2019s truck, which was parked in the driveway. She called 9-1-1, and a recording of the call was introduced at trial by the state. While Marcia was on the phone, she \u201cheard the glass in my back door breaking in and he was inside my apartment.\u201d She did not hear Mammone speak, but she heard something that he had thrown hit the ceiling. He then went back outside and threw things at the windows. Mammone left before two deputy sheriffs arrived. According to the deputies, the back door had been forced open, the screen-door glass was broken, and pieces of the door frame were on the kitchen floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-10\">{\u00b6 21} The deputies quickly realized that the incident at Marcia\u2019s apartment was linked to the incident at the Eakins\u2019 residence, but law-enforcement officers had not yet located Mammone, and they did not know whether the children were safe.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-11\">{\u00b6 22} At 6:04 a.m., Mammone left a voice mail on Hull\u2019s phone, in which the jury heard Mammone confess to Hull, \u201cI killed the kids.\u201d Mammone\u2019s voice mail continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>I said it when I got locked up fucking 358 days ago that she fucking has to die and unfortunately as fucking sick as it sounds I concluded after a while that she took my family from me and the fucking way to really get her is to take fucking her mom and her kids from her. I missed her dad by a couple minutes. I drove by the house, he was there, and I fucking circled the block and he must\u2019ve just pulled out or I\u2019d have fucking popped his fucking ass too.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">\n<em>2. Testimony of Officers</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">{\u00b6 23} Sergeant Eric Risner testified that he and other officers apprehended Mammone sometime after 7:30 a.m. on June 8, 2009, in the driveway of his residence. They found Macy and James dead in the back seat of Mammone\u2019s car, still strapped into their car seats. The children had apparently been stabbed in the throat.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">{\u00b6 24} Officer Randy Weirich testified that he removed two items from Mammone\u2019s car at the scene: a bloody knife from the back seat and a firearm from the front seat. The firearm had a live round in the chamber, its hammer was cocked, and the safety was off.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-9\">{\u00b6 25} After the vehicle was towed for processing, Officer Weirich cataloged the rest of the car\u2019s contents. The evidence log includes ammunition for a .32-caliber gun; a backpack containing knives, heavy-duty shears, and tongs; an axe handle with nails protruding from holes that had been drilled into it; a baseball bat; a military-style bayonet; Mammone\u2019s cell phone and a spare battery; a framed wedding photo of Marcia; and Marcia\u2019s dried wedding bouquet. Officer Weirich also removed from the car a switchblade and a pocket knife.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-10\">\n<em>3. Mammone\u2019s Confession</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b579-11\">{\u00b6 26} Mammone was arrested and transported to police headquarters. Once in custody, he signed a written waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and gave a full confession. The state introduced an audio recording of the confession at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b579-12\">{\u00b6 27} In his confession, Mammone explained that he had picked up Macy and James for visitation at about 4:00 p.m. on June 7. He then drove past Marcia\u2019s nearby apartment. (Mammone admitted that he was not supposed to know where Marcia lived, but he had learned her new address and occasionally stalked her.) He saw a truck parked in Marcia\u2019s driveway, and he recognized it because it had been parked there two weeks earlier. Macy told him that the truck belonged to a boy. Mammone explained that this news \u201cdidn\u2019t make me very happy obviously.\u201d He circled the block, and the truck was gone when he drove by again.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>{\u00b6 28} Mammone stated that he suspected that Marcia was on a date, so he went \u201con the hunt\u201d for her with the children in the back seat. He spent a few hours driving around looking for Marcia, all the while \u201csending [her] agitating text messages trying to get her attention.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">{\u00b6 29} Around 6:30 p.m., Mammone took the children to his place for dinner. As he continued to text Marcia, he was \u201cgetting to the point of no return.\u201d He figured that he had already violated the protection order, and he had \u201chad enough.\u201d He said that he had long hoped that things would improve, but stated that \u201conce I suspected that she might have a guy that she was interested in that was it for me, I can\u2019t deal with that. It\u2019s just not anything that I\u2019m willing to accept.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b580-6\">(\u00b6 30} According to Mammone, after dinner he loaded the children into a gold 1992 Oldsmobile that he had recently purchased. He stated that he had a Beretta .32-caliber automatic handgun, a gasoline container (which he later stopped to refill), a Scripto lighter, a bag full of butcher-type knives, a bayonet, a baseball bat, and another bat-type weapon he had made by driving nails through a hickory shovel handle or axe handle. He also said that he had approximately a dozen painkillers. He took one pill around 9:00 p.m. to \u201cdeaden the pain\u201d if he was shot by police officers later that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">{\u00b6 31} Mammone stated that he parked at Westminster Church (his and Marcia\u2019s \u201cfamily church\u201d) just before 5:45 a.m. He stabbed Macy and James with a butcher knife while they were still strapped in their car seats. Mammone related that he had to stab each child in the throat four or five times, which was more than he had expected would be necessary. When detectives asked why he had stabbed the children rather than shooting them, Mammone offered three reasons: (1) noise, (2) uncertainty about whether his gun was dependable, and (3) a desire to conserve rounds for what might lie ahead.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">{\u00b6 32} Mammone said that after killing Macy and James, he drove to the Eakins\u2019 home at approximately 5:45 a.m. He left the children in the back seat of the car and \u201cbarged in\u201d through the Eakins\u2019 unlocked door carrying his Beretta. Mammone found Margaret in a guest room and shot her in the chest. The gun jammed before he could fire a second round, so he began to hit Margaret with the gun. He then beat her with a lamp until the lamp began to fall apart. Mammone managed to unjam the gun and shot Margaret in the face at close range. He told police officers that a third bullet may have fallen out of the gun when he was attempting to dislodge the slide.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-9\">{\u00b6 33} Mammone stated that he then drove to Marcia\u2019s nearby apartment. The truck that he had seen the previous evening was in the driveway. He poured <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>gasoline on the truck and attempted to light it, but the lighter fell apart in his hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-5\">{\u00b6 34} Mammone related that after he was unable to light the fire, he retrieved four weapons from his car: (1) the handgun, which he had to unjam again to prepare to fire, (2) the bayonet, which he put in his front pocket, (3) the baseball bat, and (4) the \u201cbat type of weapon\u201d that he had made. He smashed Marcia\u2019s screen-door window and back door with the bat and then entered the apartment. Once inside, Mammone unsuccessfully looked for matches or a lighter. He did not go upstairs because he was concerned that Marcia or \u201cthe person that was there to protect her\u201d might have a firearm, and he did not want to be a \u201csitting duck.\u201d Mammone left the apartment and began throwing the baseball bat at a second-floor window, but he became frustrated. He searched his car for another lighter and, unable to find it, drove away.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">{\u00b6 35} After killing his mother-in-law and breaking into Marcia\u2019s apartment, Mammone drove around with the children\u2019s bodies for several hours. He had expected that he would want to die after committing these violent acts, but he was surprised to find that he \u201cdidn\u2019t really feel * * * like dying.\u201d He also \u201cdidn\u2019t feel like getting arrested,\u201d so he drove in areas where he did not expect to see police officers and drove the speed limit. He claimed that he then took approximately a dozen pills \u2014 which he identified as Valium or painkillers \u2014 but not enough to cause an overdose.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">{\u00b6 36} Mammone said that he then drove to the Independence Police Station to turn himself in, but he fell asleep in the station parking lot. When he woke, he contacted a relative who arranged for Mammone to turn himself in at a Canton park. En route to the park, Mammone decided to go by his apartment to switch to his BMW, with the idea of leaving the children in the Oldsmobile so that they would not be part of any scene at the park. But an unmarked police car was waiting for him, and he was apprehended.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">{\u00b6 37} Mammone told officers that he had contemplated \u201cdoing this\u201d for 22 months, but that he had initially intended to kill Marcia, not Macy and James. He said that he killed his mother-in-law because it was \u201ca major blow to [Marcia] to not have her mother.\u201d He indicated that hurting Marcia was one of the motives for killing Macy and James as well, but he also cited his objection to divorce as a reason for their murders. Mammone said that he did not intend to kill Marcia on June 8, but that he did plan to maim her. He had wanted to beat Marcia\u2019s uterus area with his homemade weapon (making her unable to conceive children), to break her ankles with the baseball bat (something she feared that she had seen done in a movie), and to cut out her tongue (as punishment for not speaking to him). Mammone also said that he would have killed the man at Marcia\u2019s apartment if he could have.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>\n<em>4. Forensic Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b582-5\">{\u00b6 38} Dr. P.S. Murthy, the Stark County coroner, performed autopsies on Margaret, Macy, and James on June 9, 2009. He testified that he determined that the cause of death for all three victims was homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">{\u00b6 39} According to Dr. Murthy, Margaret had suffered two fatal gunshot wounds and more than 20 blunt-impact injuries and lacerations, consistent with being struck by the butt of a gun and by a household lamp. One bullet had been fired into Margaret\u2019s left upper lip from a distance of about six to eight inches and was recovered from the occipital lobe of her brain. Another bullet pierced Margaret\u2019s right upper shoulder, perforated her right lung, and exited through her back.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">{\u00b6 40} Dr. Murthy testified that both children died as a result of stab wounds with exsanguination (massive blood loss). Macy had multiple stab wounds to the neck, while James had a single stab wound that went through his neck. Both children\u2019s lungs were filled with aspirated blood. Macy\u2019s right hand and right leg bore multiple defensive wounds, and James had a defensive wound on his right hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-8\">{\u00b6 41} According to a laboratory analyst who testified, multiple bloodstains on Mammone\u2019s shirt at the time of his arrest had DNA profiles consistent with Margaret\u2019s DNA. In addition, a laboratory analyst identified Mammone\u2019s fingerprint on a lighter that officers retrieved from a flowerbed near Marcia\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">{\u00b6 42} Law-enforcement officers took bodily fluid samples from Mammone on the day of his arrest. According to a laboratory analyst, tests did not reveal any trace of opiates or acetaminophen in Mammone\u2019s blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-10\">B. The Defense Case</p>\n<p id=\"b582-11\">{\u00b6 43} Mammone did not present a case in defense during the trial phase. Before the trial began, defense counsel advised the court during a bench conference that as a matter of strategy, Mammone had \u201celected to, in effect, concede the trial phase in this matter,\u201d and Mammone himself informed the judge that he instead preferred to focus on the second phase of trial. During a brief opening statement, defense counsel candidly explained to the jury that Mammone did not \u201ceontest[ ] much of the evidence and/or facts with respect to this matter.\u201d Mammone\u2019s counsel repeated that statement during trial-phase closing arguments, emphasized Mammone\u2019s honesty in responding to police officers\u2019 questioning, and urged the jury to decide the case based on the law rather than on emotion.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>C. Verdict, Sentencing, and Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">{\u00b6 44} On January 14, 2010, the jury returned guilty verdicts on all counts. After a sentencing hearing, the jury unanimously recommended a sentence of death for each of the three aggravated murders. The trial court accepted the recommendation and imposed three death sentences in open court on January 22, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">{\u00b6 45} The trial court then sentenced Mammone for his noncapital convictions. The court merged Mammone\u2019s convictions for two of the gun specifications and also merged his convictions for violating a civil protection order and aggravated burglary of the Eakins\u2019 home. Mammone was sentenced to a total of 27 years of consecutive imprisonment for his noncapital offenses. The trial court filed the R.C. 2929.03(F) sentencing opinion on January 26, 2010.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">{\u00b6 46} Mammone appealed, raising nine propositions of law. We will consider Mammone\u2019s propositions as they arose chronologically rather than in the order he presents them.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"Ad\">A. Pretrial Issues</p>\n<p id=\"AHY\">\n<em>1. Venue and Pretrial Publicity</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b583-9\">{\u00b6 47} In his first proposition of law, Mammone argues that the trial court\u2019s denial of his motion for a change of venue violated his rights to due process and to a fair trial by an impartial jury. <em>See </em>the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution; Ohio Constitution, Article I, Sections 5 and 16. According to Mammone, Stark County was so saturated with media coverage of his case that we should presume \u201cprejudice from the weight of the adverse publicity\u201d without the need for further inquiry. Alternatively, Mammone argues that we should conduct a review of the complete record and conclude that members of the jury were actually biased against Mammone due to their exposure to the extensive coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-10\">\n<em>a. Factual and procedural background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b583-11\">{\u00b6 48} Mammone filed a pretrial motion for a change of venue on October 1, 2009. As an appendix to the motion, Mammone attached copies of articles posted on the <em>Canton </em>Repository\u2019s website, CantonRep.com, between June 9 and August 26, 2009, along with comments posted by online readers of the newspaper.

During the hearing, Mammone submitted 11 exhibits, including coverage of his case from various radio, television, and print publications. The materials included a copy of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>a \u201cconfession letter\u201d that had been published in the print version of the <em>Repository </em>on August 25, 2009, and posted on its website. The letter, written and sent by Mammone himself, began with the statement that it was mailed to the newspaper to \u201cset the record straight regarding any questions and misconceptions\u201d about the murders of Margaret, Macy, and James. Mammone argued at the hearing that in light of these materials, \u201can attempt to seat a jury would be likely futile,\u201d so that the court should presume prejudice and grant his change-of-venue motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">{\u00b6 50} The state countered that it would be premature to change venue before conducting voir dire, and the trial court agreed. The court expressed concern about the <em>Repository\u2019s </em>publication of Mammone\u2019s letter, but observed that \u201cthis case has not gotten nearly the type of publicity\u201d that would require the court to grant the motion without even seeking \u201cto review and do a voir dire of prospective jurors.\u201d Without a thorough voir dire, the court deemed it impossible to determine whether media exposure was \u201cso pervasive that an impartial jury [would] be impossible to seat.\u201d As a result, the court denied Mammone\u2019s motion as premature but left the issue open for further consideration \u201cduring and after the Voir Dire.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">{\u00b6 51} At the close of the venue hearing, the court advised Mammone, \u201cI would expect you to refile at any time or reargue your motion for a change of venue.\u201d Mammone never did so.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">{\u00b6 52} We decline to allow Mammone to benefit from the publicity he created by submitting his own confession to the <em>Repository. </em>We conclude that the trial court\u2019s denial of Mammone\u2019s motion for a change of venue did not violate his rights to due process and to a fair trial by an impartial jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-8\">\n<em>b.

Illinois, </em>504 U.S. 719, 726-728, 112 S.Ct. 2222, 119 L.Ed.2d 492 (1992). \u201c[W]hen it appears that a fair and impartial trial cannot be held in the court in which the action is pending,\u201d Crim.R. 18(B) gives a trial court authority \u2014 sua sponte or upon a party\u2019s motion \u2014 to transfer venue to another jurisdiction. <em>See </em>R.C. 2901.12(E); <em>State v.

Texas, </em>381 U.S. 532, 85 S.Ct. 1628, 14 L.Ed.2d 543 (1965); <em>Rideau v.

To prevail on a claim of presumed prejudice, however, a defendant must make \u201c \u2018a clear and manifest showing * * * that pretrial publicity was so pervasive and prejudicial that an attempt to seat a jury would be a vain act.\u2019 \u201d <em>Warner </em>at 46, quoting <em>Herring </em>at syllabus; <em>see Herring </em>at 18 (citing judicial economy, convenience, and reducing taxpayer expense as reasons for a trial court to attempt to seat a jury prior to transferring venue to another location).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">{\u00b6 57} We therefore must engage in a two-step analysis of venue in this case, determining first whether the jury was presumptively prejudiced against Mammone and, if not, whether Mammone has established actual juror prejudice. <em>See Skilling v. United States, </em>561 U.S. 358, 381; <em>Campbell v. Bradshaw, </em>674 F.3d 578, 593-594 (6th Cir.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">c. <em>Prejudice should not be presumed in this case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b585-10\">{\u00b6 58} \u201cA presumption of prejudice\u201d because of adverse press coverage \u201cattends only the extreme case.\u201d <em>Skilling </em>at 381; <em>see also Campbell </em>at 593, quoting <em>Foley v. Parker, </em>488 F.3d 377, 387 (6th Cir.2007) (prejudice from pretrial publicity \u201c \u2018is rarely presumed\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-11\">{\u00b6 59} The doctrine of presumed prejudice \u201cis the product of three Supreme Court decisions from the 1960\u2019s\u201d: <em>Rideau v. Louisiana, Estes v. Texas, </em>and <em>Sheppard v. Maxwell. Hayes v. Ayers, </em>632 F.3d 500, 508 (9th Cir.2011). The United States Supreme Court most recently applied the doctrine in <em>Skilling v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number><em>United States, </em>in which the court analyzed four factors before rejecting a claim of presumed prejudice. Namely, the court considered (1) the size and characteristics of the community in which the crime occurred, (2) whether media coverage about the defendant contained \u201cblatantly prejudicial information of the type readers or viewers could not reasonably be expected to shut from sight,\u201d (3) whether the passage of time lessened media attention, and (4) whether the jury\u2019s conduct was inconsistent with a presumption of prejudice. <em>Id. </em>at 382-383; <em>see United States v. Warren, </em>989 F.Supp.2d 494 (E.D.La.2013). However, <em>Skilling </em>did not hold that these four factors are dispositive in every case or indicate that these are the only relevant factors in a presumed-prejudice analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">{\u00b6 60} Here, we find that our analysis is best informed by comparing the facts of this case not to <em>Skilling </em>\u2014in which prejudice was not presumed \u2014 but to the facts of the cases in which the United States Supreme Court <em>has </em>presumed prejudice. Two of these three cases, <em>Estes </em>and <em>Sheppard, </em>are not particularly instructive because they \u201cinvolved media interference with courtroom proceedings <em>during </em>trial.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>Skilling, </em>561 U.S. at 382, 130 S.Ct. 2896, 177 L.Ed.2d 619, fn. 14; <em>see also Hayes, </em>632 F.3d at 508. In <em>Estes, </em>\u201cextensive publicity before trial swelled into excessive exposure during preliminary court proceedings\u201d as the media \u201coverran the courtroom\u201d and caused significant disruption. <em>Skilling </em>at 379-380. In <em>Sheppard, </em>\u201cbedlam reigned at the courthouse during the trial and newsmen took over practically the entire courtroom.\u201d <em>Sheppard, </em>384 U.S. at 355, 86 S.Ct. 1507, 16 L.Ed.2d 600. The United States Supreme Court in <em>Sheppard </em>\u201cupset the [defendant\u2019s] murder conviction because a \u2018carnival atmosphere\u2019 [had] pervaded the trial.\u201d <em>Skilling </em>at 380, quoting <em>Sheppard </em>at 358. There is no evidence of such interference here.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">{\u00b6 61} The third case, <em>Rideau, </em>is most relevant to our analysis because in that case, the United States Supreme Court presumed prejudice based solely on pretrial publicity. In <em>Rideau, </em>the parish sheriffs office had filmed an interrogation of the defendant, during which he confessed to bank robbery, kidnapping, and murder. 373 U.S. at 724, 83 S.Ct. 1417, 10 L.Ed.2d 663. A 20-minute recording of the confession was broadcast three times on television within weeks of Rideau\u2019s trial. <em>Id. </em>Audiences ranging from 20,000 to 53,000 people viewed the broadcasts, in a total population of approximately 150,000 people. <em>Id. </em>Under the circumstances, the United States Supreme Court concluded that \u201cto the tens of thousands of people who saw and heard\u201d Rideau \u201cpersonally confessing in detail to the crimes,\u201d the interrogation \u201cin a very real sense <em>was </em>Rideau\u2019s trial \u2014 at which he pleaded guilty to murder.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>Id. </em>at 726. As a result, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>court concluded that the defendant\u2019s subsequent trial amounted to a \u201chollow formality,\u201d and it conclusively presumed prejudice. <em>Id. </em>at 726-727.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">{\u00b6 62} As in <em>Rideau, </em>the instant case involves the widespread dissemination of a suspect\u2019s supposed confession to crimes. Like the trial court, we believe that \u201cthe publication of the [confession] letter on the front page\u201d of the <em>Repository </em>\u201cis the thing that\u2019s most troublesome\u201d about the pretrial publicity in this case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A \u201cdefendant\u2019s own confession [is] probably the most probative and damaging evidence that can be admitted against him.\u201d <em>Skilling </em>at 383, quoting <em>Parker v. Randolph, </em>442 U.S. 62, 72, 99 S.Ct. 2132, 60 L.Ed.2d 713 (1979) (plurality opinion). That said, pretrial publicity about a confession \u2014 even one that is inadmissible at trial<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u2014 \u201cis not in itself sufficient to require a venue transfer.\u201d <em>United States v. Warren, </em>989 F.Supp.2d at 501.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">{\u00b6 63} Several constitutionally significant factors distinguish the print publication of Mammone\u2019s confession from the repeated television broadcasts of Rideau\u2019s confession that aired in 1961. First, the manner of publication differed in a crucial way. As the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit has explained, \u201c[T]he controlling factor in the <em>[Rideau] </em>decision was the fact that the public <em>viewed </em>the confession in a televised format.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>DeLisle v. Rivers, </em>161 F.3d 370, 384 (6th Cir.1998) (en banc). \u201c[Actually seeing and hearing the confession, as one would in a courtroom, would create a certainty of belief that would be difficult for the public to lay aside.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, the public did not <em>view </em>Mammone confessing.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-7\">{\u00b6 64} Second, the circumstances of publication diverge from <em>Rideau </em>in significant ways. In <em>Rideau, </em>the defendant\u2019s televised confession aired just weeks before the trial began, and roughly one-third of the entire local population viewed the broadcast. Here, Mammone\u2019s confession letter was published a single time more than four months before his trial began. And Mammone failed to establish a level of exposure in Stark County similar to the exposure in <em>Rideau. </em>The trial court concluded that it was not futile to attempt to seat a jury given \u201cthe figures submitted by the <em>Repository\u201d </em>about readership, \u201cthe population of Stark County,\u201d and the considerations that the county has three newspapers and that many <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>county residents subscribe to a fourth newspaper published outside the county. Mammone never supplemented the record or attempted to reargue this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">{\u00b6 65} Third, unlike <em>Rideau, </em>in which the defendant played no role in the dissemination of his confession, here Mammone himself provided the confession letter to the <em>Repository. </em>He therefore is responsible for instigating the single most significant incident of pretrial publicity in his case, which more than anything increased that publicity to a level that he claims should have required the trial court to grant his motion to change venue.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">{\u00b6 66} Finally, although Mammone claims that \u201c[t]he venires were replete with potential jurors who had been extensively prejudiced by media accounts and had formed such strong opinions as to not be able or willing to change their minds,\u201d the voir dire transcript reveals otherwise. Prejudice should not be presumed.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">{\u00b6 67} The trial court was very conscious of pretrial publicity in Mammone\u2019s case. Each potential juror was asked to complete an extensive publicity questionnaire, and the court permitted thorough questioning about publicity issues during small-group voir dire. Dozens of potential jurors stated that they knew nothing about the case. The court instructed the potential jurors during voir dire to disregard all information from outside sources and sought assurances that every juror would set aside any preexisting opinions and be fair to both sides. The potential jurors were reminded that the media is not always accurate, and they were warned to avoid additional publicity. Most importantly, the trial court excused potential jurors who expressed an inability to set aside preexisting opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">{\u00b6 68} Under these circumstances, we cannot conclude that extensive pretrial publicity rendered Mammone\u2019s trial a \u201chollow formality.\u201d <em>Compare Rideau, </em>373 U.S. at 726, 83 S.Ct. 1417, 10 L.Ed.2d 663. As a result, we hold that this is not one of the extraordinary cases in which prejudice should be presumed based solely on the amount and nature of the pretrial publicity alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-9\">\n<em>d. Actual prejudice does not exist in this case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b588-10\">{\u00b6 69} Having concluded that prejudice should not be presumed here, we next analyze whether actual prejudice exists. Because Mammone did not raise this objection in the trial court or seek a change of venue at any point after the pretrial venue hearing, we review this claim for plain error. <em>See State v. Trimble, </em>122 Ohio St.3d 297, 2009-Ohio-2961, 911 N.E.2d 242, \u00b6 61 (reviewing change-of-venue claim for plain error when defendant had waived the argument). We take notice of plain error \u201cwith the utmost caution, under exceptional circumstances and only to prevent a miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>State v. Long, </em>53 Ohio St.2d 91, 372 N.E.2d 804 (1978), paragraph three of the syllabus. To prevail, Mammone must show that an error occurred, that the error was plain, and that but for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>error, the outcome of the trial clearly would have been otherwise. <em>State v. Barnes, </em>94 Ohio St.3d 21, 27, 759 N.E.2d 1240 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">{\u00b6 70} Mammone levies several charges of actual bias due to pretrial publicity among members of both the jury pool and the seated jury and argues that the trial court should have ordered a change of venue. For the reasons below, we find no error in this regard, let alone plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">{\u00b6 71} First, Mammone argues that he was denied a fair trial because almost every seated juror \u201chad either read, heard, discussed or [seen] an account of the deaths of the Mammone children and their grandmother.\u201d But actual bias is not established simply by pointing out some degree of media exposure. <em>See, e.g., Trimble </em>at \u00b6 63-64; <em>State v. Maurer, </em>15 Ohio St.3d 239, 251, 473 N.E.2d 768 (1984). A juror -will be considered unbiased \u201cif the juror can lay aside his impression or opinion and render a verdict based on the evidence presented in court.\u201d <em>Irvin, </em>366 U.S. at 723, 81 S.Ct. 1639, 6 L.Ed.2d 751.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">{\u00b6 72} Second, Mammone objects that four specific seated jurors \u2014 juror Nos. 372, 438, 448, and 461 \u2014 were biased against him. But juror Nos. 438 and 448 testified that they had not formed <em>any </em>opinions about the case before trial. Juror Nos. 372 and 461 admitted that they had formed some preliminary opinions, but they assured the judge that they could set these opinions aside and be fair.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-7\">{\u00b6 73} The trial judge is \u201cin the best position to judge each juror\u2019s demeanor and fairness\u201d and thus to decide whether to credit a potential juror\u2019s assurance that he or she will set aside any prior knowledge and preconceived notions of guilt. <em>Trimble, </em>122 Ohio St.3d 297, 2009-Ohio-2961, 911 N.E.2d 242, at \u00b6 64. One factor in determining whether a trial judge reasonably accepted such assurances is how many other potential jurors admitted a disqualifying prejudice:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b589-8\">In a community where most veniremen will admit to a disqualifying prejudice, the reliability of the others\u2019 protestations [of impartiality] may be drawn into question; for it is then more probable that they are part of a community deeply hostile to the accused, and more likely that they may unwittingly have been influenced by it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b589-9\"><em>Murphy v. Florida, </em>421 U.S. 794, 803, 95 S.Ct. 2031, 44 L.Ed.2d 589 (1975). Here, there is no evidence of such unwitting influence. For example, in the first small-group voir dire session of 12 potential jurors, only two admitted to a disqualifying prejudice based on pretrial publicity and were excused. Upon careful examination of the record, we defer to the trial court\u2019s reasonable conclusion that the four jurors now challenged could be fair and impartial jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>{\u00b6 74} Finally, we are not persuaded by Mammone\u2019s vague claim that the entire jury was tainted because those jurors who had been exposed to extensive publicity shared \u201cinnumerable opinions about the case\u201d with other jurors. As explained above, Mammone has not established that any of his jurors were actually biased by pretrial publicity. Moreover, he presents no evidence that any juror improperly influenced another juror by stating an inappropriate opinion. Under the circumstances, we reject Mammone\u2019s contention as meritless and unsupported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">{\u00b6 75} For these reasons, we reject proposition of law I.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">\n<em>2. Juror Bias in Favor of the Death Penalty</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b590-7\">{\u00b6 76} In his second proposition of law, Mammone argues that two of his trial jurors, juror Nos. 418 and 448, \u201cwere unfairly biased in favor of the death penalty\u201d and made it apparent during their responses to questioning during voir dire that they \u201cwould automatically vote for the death penalty once they found Mammone guilty of the facts in this case.\u201d He asserts that this bias violated his constitutional rights to due process, to receive a fair and reliable sentence, and to be free from cruel and unusual punishment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See </em>the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution; Ohio Constitution, Article I, Sections 9, 10, and 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">{\u00b6 77} The United States Supreme Court and this court have long recognized that a defendant\u2019s right to a fair and impartial jury extends to capital sentencing. Accordingly, \u201c[a] prospective juror in a capital case may be excused for cause if [the prospective juror\u2019s] views on capital punishment would \u2018 \u201cprevent or substantially impair the performance of [the prospective juror\u2019s] duties as a juror in accordance with [the prospective juror\u2019s] instructions and * * * oath.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>State v.

Texas, </em>448 U.S. 38, 45, 100 S.Ct. 2521, 65 L.Ed.2d 581 (1980). If a juror would \u201cautomatically vote for the death penalty in every case,\u201d the juror cannot be fair and impartial because he or she \u201cwill fail in good faith to consider the evidence of aggravating and mitigating circumstances as the instructions require [the juror] to do.\u201d <em>Morgan v. Illinois, </em>504 U.S. at 729, 112 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>2222, 119 L.Ed.2d 492. \u201cIf even one such juror is empaneled and the death sentence is imposed, the State is disentitled to execute the sentence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">{\u00b6 78} When a defendant challenges a prospective juror for cause, the trial court\u2019s ruling \u201cwill not be disturbed on appeal unless it is manifestly arbitrary and unsupported by substantial testimony, so as to constitute an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>State v. Williams, </em>79 Ohio St.3d 1, 8, 679 N.E.2d 646 (1997). However, a defendant who does not present a challenge for cause \u201cwaive[s] any alleged error in regard to [that] prospective juror.\u201d <em>Jackson </em>at \u00b6 39; <em>see State v.

On her written questionnaire inquiring into her views on capital punishment, juror No. 418 stated her belief \u201cthat the punishment should fit the crime\u201d and stated that if a defendant \u201cis found guilty without doubt of taking another person\u2019s life, he indeed is not entitled to live out his own life.\u201d She indicated that the death penalty is \u201c[generally the proper punishment\u201d for aggravated murder, \u201cwith very few exceptions.\u201d However, she acknowledged that \u201cthere may be circumstances \u2014 such as, mental disability \u2014 \u201d in which it is not appropriate. Ultimately, juror No. 418 expressed her belief \u201cthat the death penalty is appropriate in <em>some </em>capital murder cases.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b591-8\">{\u00b6 81} During voir dire, defense counsel questioned juror No. 418 to determine whether she would automatically impose a death sentence if Mammone were convicted. The juror again explained that she generally thinks \u201cpunishment should fit the crime,\u201d but that she does not firmly believe that every murderer should receive the death penalty. She observed that \u201csometimes there are circumstances that you need to think about,\u201d such as \u201ca mental issue\u201d or \u201cthose types of things.\u201d In the absence of such circumstances, however, juror No. 418 stated that \u201cit should be an eye for an eye definitely, and especially where there [are] small children involved where it sounds like there was [here].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b591-9\">{\u00b6 82} Juror No. 418 never indicated that she would automatically impose the death penalty if Mammone were convicted. Her questionnaire and her verbal responses indicated a general preference for the death penalty for those who commit aggravated murder, but she consistently acknowledged exceptions \u2014 both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>before and after the trial court explained the two phases of a capital trial and the jury\u2019s duty to weigh aggravating circumstances and mitigating factors. <em>See State v. Stojetz, </em>84 Ohio St.3d 452, 460, 705 N.E.2d 329 (1999) (rejecting argument that a juror was an \u201cautomatic death penalty juror\u201d when the juror had \u201cexpressed a willingness to take into consideration other factors, such as defendant\u2019s background and the nature and circumstances of the crime, before deciding to render a death verdict\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b592-4\">{\u00b6 83} \u201c[DJeference must be accorded to the trial judge who sees and hears the juror.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, neither the court nor the parties expressed any concern that juror No. 418 was an \u201cautomatic death\u201d juror, even as they discussed concerns about other prospective jurors in the same small-group voir dire. Under these circumstances, we defer to the trial judge\u2019s decision to seat juror No. 418 and find no error with respect to her service.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">\n<em>b. Juror No. U8</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b592-6\">{\u00b6 84} Mammone also argues that juror No. 448 was \u201cunfairly biased in favor of the death penalty\u201d and \u201ccould not fairly consider all the possible sentencing options in this case.\u201d As with juror No. 418, Mammone did not challenge juror No. 448 for cause, so plain-error review applies. <em>Hale, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 118, 2008-Ohio-3426, 892 N.E.2d 864, at \u00b6 89-90.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-7\">{\u00b6 85} During larger-group voir dire, the trial judge flagged juror No. 448 as a juror to discuss with counsel. Juror No. 448 had responded to a question from defense counsel by stating, \u201cI think I would have some problem with\u201d being fair given the circumstances of the case. Later, the court and counsel for both sides discussed whether to have this juror return for small-group voir dire. The prosecutor indicated that she \u201cwant[ed] the opportunity to explore why\u201d juror No. 448 had \u201csaid I can\u2019t be fair.\u201d The court agreed that juror No. 448 should remain in the jury pool, and the defense made no effort to excuse the juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-8\">{\u00b6 86} Juror No. 448 first indicated his attitude toward the death penalty on his written questionnaire asking for his views on that subject. His responses revealed some tension in his thoughts about capital punishment. On the one hand, juror No. 448 wrote that he supported \u201cthe state law and right to enforce the death penalty\u201d \u2014 which he characterized as a \u201cGod-ordained law of the land\u201d \u2014 and he indicated agreement with the view that the death penalty is the \u201cproper punishment in all cases where someone is convicted of aggravated murder.\u201d On the other hand, he also wrote, \u201cI am not sure due to my religious views if I could give a death penalty verdict.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b592-9\">{\u00b6 87} During small-group voir dire, the judge and both parties explored this tension. Juror No. 448 assured the judge that even though he had \u201csome religious problems with it,\u201d he recognized the state\u2019s authority to impose the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>death penalty and \u201cwould want to follow [the court\u2019s] orders.\u201d He later explained that even though his church \u201cin general leans toward being\u201d pacifistic, he \u201cbelieves that an eye for an eye is in the Bible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">{\u00b6 88} During prosecution questioning, juror No. 448 expressed a preference for the death penalty in all cases of aggravated murder. But he later clarified that he could not say for sure whether if there were a conviction he would sentence Mammone to death; he \u201cwould have to look at the evidence.\u201d The prosecutor explained that mitigating factors \u201care things that might cause [a juror] to consider a sentence less than death,\u201d and juror No. 448 responded that he would follow \u201cthe law of the land\u201d and \u201cwould consider\u201d such a sentence. The prosecutor again asked, \u201cSo you\u2019ll follow the Judge\u2019s instructions?\u201d The juror said yes. But to defense counsel he again indicated in response to further questioning that if Mammone were convicted of aggravated murder, he \u201cwould tend or would vote for capital punishment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">{\u00b6 89} The judge and the parties did not later specifically analyze juror No. 448\u2019s attitudes about the death penalty because neither party challenged him for cause. However, the trial court did comment on juror No. 448\u2019s responses when analyzing a challenge to juror No. 412. The court observed that juror Nos. 412 and 448 had both \u201cgiven answers which would indicate a natural inclination to lean towards the death penalty.\u201d But the court went on to explain that \u201c[sjometimes in a vacuum it\u2019s hard for jurors to articulate how they feel about [the death penalty], and so it comes down to the basics of whether or not they would follow the law fairly, and that\u2019s why I pushed them on fairly.\u201d The court then denied the challenge to juror No. 412, and there was no further discussion of juror No. 448.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-7\">{\u00b6 90} The trial judge\u2019s comments are consistent with this court\u2019s past observations regarding the difficulty of having prospective jurors articulate their views on capital punishment during voir dire. Many prospective jurors in a death-penalty case are being asked \u201cto face their views about the death penalty\u201d \u201cfor the first time\u201d during voir dire. <em>Williams, </em>79 Ohio St.3d at 6, 679 N.E.2d 646. \u201c[I]t is not uncommon for jurors to express themselves in contradictory and ambiguous ways\u201d in this context, \u201cboth due to unfamiliarity with courtroom proceedings and cross-examination tactics and because the jury pool runs the spectrum in terms of education and experience.\u201d <em>White v. Mitchell, </em>431 F.3d 517, 537 (6th Cir.2005), citing <em>Patton v. Yount, </em>467 U.S. 1025, 1039, 104 S.Ct. 2885, 81 L.Ed.2d 847 (1984). Moreover, even when a prospective juror does have \u201cvery strongly held views\u201d about the death penalty, he or she likely has \u201cnever had to define them within the context of following the law.\u201d <em>Williams </em>at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>{\u00b6 91} During voir dire, both parties may be \u201cattempting to push a prospective juror into a certain position in order to remove him or her from the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7-8. Accordingly, \u201cit is often necessary <em>for </em>the trial judge to step in and provide some neutral, nonleading instructions and questions in an attempt to determine whether the prospective juror can actually be fair and impartial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 8. It then falls naturally on the \u201ctrial judge to sort through [the] responses and determine whether the prospective jurors will be able to follow the law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">{\u00b6 92} In this case, neither the judge nor the parties ultimately expressed reservations that juror No. 448 was biased in favor of the death penalty. When asked, the juror agreed that he could follow the trial judge\u2019s instructions on mitigating factors. The judge was able to \u201csee[ ] and heart ]\u201d juror No. 448, <em>Waimoright v. Witt, </em>469 U.S. at 426, 105 S.Ct. 844, 83 L.Ed.2d 841, and therefore had \u201cthe benefit of observing [the juror\u2019s] demeanor and body language.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>79 Ohio St.3d at 8, 679 N.E.2d 646. The judge was satisfied that juror No. 448 would follow instructions, and we defer to that judgment. <em>See Jackson, </em>107 Ohio St.3d 53, 2005-Ohio-5981, 836 N.E.2d 1173, at \u00b640 (no abuse of discretion in denying challenge for cause when \u201ca juror, even one predisposed in favor of imposing death, states that he or she will follow the law and the court\u2019s instructions\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">{\u00b6 93} For these reasons, we reject proposition II.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">B. Trial-Phase and Mitigation-Phase Issues</p>\n<p id=\"AcI\">\n<em>1. Gruesome Photographs</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">{\u00b6 94} Mammone argues in his fifth proposition of law that the trial court violated his constitutional rights by admitting \u201cshocking and gruesome photographs\u201d that were \u201cirrelevant, unnecessary, cumulative, [and] repetitive.\u201d Specifically, he challenges the admission of two categories of photos: (1) crime-scene photos of the dead children in their car seats and (2) autopsy photos of the children.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> According to Mammone, we should order a new trial or vacate his death sentence because these photos deprived him of due process, a fair trial, and a reliable sentencing determination. <em>See </em>the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution; Ohio Constitution, Article I, Sections 2, 9,10, and 16. We reject this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>{\u00b6 95} Under Evid.R. 403(A), a trial court <em>must </em>exclude evidence \u201cif its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, of confusion of the issues, or of misleading the jury.\u201d Under Evid.R. 403(B), a trial court <em>may </em>exclude evidence \u201cif its probative value is substantially outweighed by considerations of undue delay, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">{\u00b6 96} In the context of capital trials, however, we have established \u201ca stricter evidentiary standard\u201d for admitting gruesome photographs and have \u201cstrongly caution[ed] judicious use.\u201d <em>State v. Morales, </em>32 Ohio St.3d 252, 257-258, 259, 513 N.E.2d 267 (1987), citing <em>State v. Maurer, </em>15 Ohio St.3d 239, 473 N.E.2d 768, at paragraph seven of the syllabus. A gruesome photograph is admissible only if its \u201cprobative value * * * outweigh[s] the danger of prejudice to the defendant.\u201d <em>Morales </em>at 258. Unlike Evid.R. 403, which turns on whether prejudice <em>substantially </em>outweighs probative value, this standard requires \u201ca simple balancing of the relative values\u201d of prejudice and probative value. <em>Id. </em>And even if a photo satisfies the balancing test, it can be \u201cneither repetitive nor cumulative in nature.\u201d <em>Id.; see State v. Thompson, </em>33 Ohio St.3d 1, 9, 514 N.E.2d 407 (1987). A trial court\u2019s decision that a photo satisfies this standard is reviewable only for abuse of discretion. <em>See State v. Vrabel, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 184, 2003-Ohio-3193, 790 N.E.2d 303, \u00b6 69; <em>Morales </em>at 257; <em>Maurer </em>at 264.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">\n<em>a. Photos of the crime scene</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">{\u00b6 97} First, Mammone challenges the introduction of two crime-scene photos, Exhibits 2H and 21, showing Macy and James dead in their car seats. These photos depict the condition in which police officers found the child victims at the time of Mammone\u2019s arrest. Mammone unsuccessfully sought to exclude these photos before trial and again objected to them at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">{\u00b6 98} Exhibits 2H and 21 had significant probative value. Each photo \u201cillustrated the testimony of the detectives who described the crime scene,\u201d and also was \u201cprobative of [the defendant\u2019s] intent and the manner and circumstances of the victims\u2019 deaths.\u201d <em>Trimble, </em>122 Ohio St.3d 297, 2009-Ohio-2961, 911 N.E.2d 242, at \u00b6 134, 136; <em>see also State v. Monroe, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 384, 2005-Ohio-2282, 827 N.E.2d 285, \u00b6 26; <em>Morales </em>at 258. Detectives Weirich and Risner testified that upon arriving at the scene, they found the children dead in the back seat of Mammone\u2019s car. Macy and James had been stabbed in the throat while strapped into their car seats, unable to move.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-9\">{\u00b6 99} Mammone nevertheless claims that these photos were \u201ccompletely unnecessary\u201d because he never denied murdering Macy and James and the state could have proven cause of death \u201cin a less gruesome manner.\u201d But we have repeatedly rejected similar arguments in the past. <em>See Vrabel, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 184, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>2003-Ohio-3193, 790 N.E.2d 303, at \u00b6 70; <em>Maurer, </em>15 Ohio St.3d at 264-265, 473 N.E.2d 768. The state had the burden to prove that Mammone purposely killed the children, and these photos were probative of that issue. <em>See Maurer </em>at 265, quoting <em>State v. Strodes, </em>48 Ohio St.2d 113, 116, 357 N.E.2d 375 (1976), <em>vacated in part on other grounds, </em>438 U.S. 911, 98 S.Ct. 3135, 57 L.Ed.2d 1154 (1978) (\u201c \u2018[t]he state must prove, and the jury must find, that the killing was purposely done\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">{\u00b6 100} Under these circumstances, we conclude that the probative value of these two photos outweighed the danger of unfair prejudice to Mammone and that the photos \u201cwere neither repetitive nor cumulative in nature.\u201d <em>Morales, </em>32 Ohio St.3d at 258, 513 N.E.2d 267. The prosecution selected, and the trial court admitted, a single photo of each child victim from 34 available crime-scene photos showing Mammone\u2019s car with the children inside. These two photos were published to the jury only once, although two witnesses authenticated them during their testimony. Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by admitting Exhibits 2H and 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">\n<em>b. Autopsy photos</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">{\u00b6 101} Mammone also challenges the admission of autopsy photos \u201cof very young children.\u201d The trial court admitted six autopsy photos of James\u2019s injuries, Exhibits 5A-F, and seven of Macy\u2019s, Exhibits 6A-G. Defense counsel unsuccessfully sought to exclude these photos both before trial and during the coroner\u2019s testimony at trial. But notably, Mammone personally thanked the court during his allocution \u201cfor the discretion used in, ah, limiting the, ah, display of autopsy photos for the deceased in this matter.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">{\u00b6 102} Exhibits 5A-F and 6A-G had significant probative value. As mentioned above, the state was required to prove that Mammone purposely killed Macy and James. <em>See Maurer, </em>15 Ohio St.3d at 265, 473 N.E.2d 768. The number and location of the children\u2019s injuries and the resulting wounds were all probative evidence of a purpose to cause death. <em>Id. </em>In addition, each photo supported and illustrated the coroner\u2019s testimony about the wounds inflicted on Macy and James and the cause of their deaths. <em>Trimble, </em>122 Ohio St.3d 297, 2009-Ohio-2961, 911 N.E.2d 242, at \u00b6 148; <em>Monroe, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 384, 2005-Ohio-2282, 827 N.E.2d 285, at \u00b6 26; <em>Vrabel, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 184, 2003-Ohio-3193, 790 N.E.2d 303, at \u00b6 72.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-9\">{\u00b6 103} As with the crime-scene photos, Mammone contends that the prejudicial impact of showing the jury gruesome autopsy photos of young children outweighed this probative value. Mammone asserts that the photos were unnecessary because he did not dispute the cause of the children\u2019s deaths and because the state could have used testimony alone to prove the children\u2019s injuries. But, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>as explained above, the state bears the burden of proof and it has no obligation to meet that burden in the <em>least </em>gruesome way. Consistent with our previous holdings in cases involving children, we conclude that the prejudicial impact of these autopsy photos did not outweigh their probative value. <em>See, e.g., Vrabel </em>at \u00b6 69-72; <em>Trimble </em>at \u00b6 142-145, 155.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">{\u00b6 104} Further, these photos were neither repetitive nor cumulative. At trial, the state offered seven of the more than 100 photographs taken during Macy\u2019s autopsy. Each photo presents a different injury. Exhibit 6A depicts Macy as she arrived at the coroner\u2019s office, still strapped in her car seat. Exhibits 6B, 6D, and 6E show different knife wounds: (1) three wounds to Macy\u2019s left lower face and upper neck, severing her esophagus and trachea, (2) a cluster of three wounds on Macy\u2019s left neck, and (3) an exit wound. Exhibits 6C and 6F depict defensive wounds on Macy\u2019s right hand and right leg, respectively. Finally, Exhibit 6G shows finger-shaped bruises on Macy\u2019s left leg, consistent with someone having a firm grip on that spot.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">{\u00b6 105} Likewise, each of the six autopsy photos of James depicts something different: (1) Exhibit 5B shows a defensive wound on James\u2019s right palm, (2) Exhibit 5E depicts a large stab wound on James\u2019s neck, transecting his esophagus and trachea and cutting through to his back, (3) Exhibit 5F depicts the exit wound on James\u2019s upper left back, (4) Exhibit 5A captures a close-up of James\u2019s hands, (5) Exhibit 5C shows a view of the stab wound on his neck from the other side of his head, and (6) Exhibit 5D shows injuries on his right arm, including the defensive wound on his right hand. Like the autopsy photos of Macy, none of these photos is cumulative or repetitive.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">{\u00b6 106} For these reasons, we find no abuse of discretion in the admission of these autopsy photos.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Mammone\u2019s fifth proposition of law fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-9\">\n<em>2. Prosecutorial Misconduct</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b597-10\">{\u00b6 107} In his fourth and sixth propositions of law, Mammone argues that his due-process rights were violated due to prosecutorial misconduct. <em>See </em>the Sixth, Eighth, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution; Ohio <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>Constitution, Article I, Sections 1, 2, 9, 10, 16, and 20. According to Mammone, the prosecution \u201cinfest[ed]\u201d the trial phase by introducing irrelevant and \u201cdisturbing physical evidence in such a manner that it inflame[d] the jury.\u201d And at the sentencing phase, he contends, the prosecutor committed misconduct by questioning a defense expert\u2019s failure to write a report and by arguing revenge as an aggravating circumstance.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">{\u00b6 108} A prosecutor is \u201cin a peculiar and very definite sense the servant of the law, the twofold aim of which is that guilt shall not escape or innocence suffer.\u201d <em>Berger v. United States, </em>295 U.S. 78, 88, 55 S.Ct. 629, 79 L.Ed. 1314 (1935); <em>see State v. Lott, </em>51 Ohio St.3d 160, 166, 555 N.E.2d 293 (1990) <em>(Berger </em>court\u2019s comments about prosecutors \u201capply with equal force to Ohio prosecuting attorneys\u201d). Accordingly, even though a prosecutor \u201cmay prosecute with earnestness and vigor\u201d and \u201cmay strike hard blows,\u201d a prosecutor \u201cis not at liberty to strike foul ones.\u201d <em>Berger </em>at 88. Prosecutors have a \u201cduty to refrain from improper methods calculated to produce a wrongful conviction.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">{\u00b6 109} Because allegations of prosecutorial misconduct implicate due-process concerns, the touchstone of this analysis is the \u201c \u2018fairness of the trial, not the culpability of the prosecutor.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Newton, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 13, 2006-Ohio-81, 840 N.E.2d 593, \u00b6 92, quoting <em>Smith v. Phillips, </em>455 U.S. 209, 219, 102 S.Ct. 940, 71 L.Ed.2d 78 (1982). If any misconduct occurred, the court must consider the effect it had on the jury \u201cin the context of the entire trial.\u201d <em>State v. Keenan, </em>66 Ohio St.3d 402, 410, 613 N.E.2d 203 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">{\u00b6 110} With regard to each allegation of misconduct, we must determine whether the conduct was \u201cimproper, and, if so, whether [it] prejudicially affected substantial rights of the defendant.\u201d <em>State v. Smith, </em>14 Ohio St.3d 13, 14, 470 N.E.2d 883 (1984). \u201c[A] defendant\u2019s substantial rights cannot be prejudiced when the remaining evidence, standing alone, is so overwhelming that it constitutes defendant\u2019s guilt, and the outcome of the case would have been the same regardless of evidence admitted erroneously.\u201d <em>State v. Hicks, </em>194 Ohio App.3d 743, 2011-Ohio-3578, 957 N.E.2d 866, \u00b6 30 (8th Dist.2011), citing <em>State v. Williams, </em>38 Ohio St.3d 346, 349-350, 528 N.E.2d 910 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">{\u00b6 111} If a defendant failed to object to the alleged misconduct below, however, we review the claim for plain error. To prevail on plain-error review, Mammone must establish both that misconduct occurred and that but for the misconduct, the outcome of the trial clearly would have been otherwise. <em>State v. Barnes, </em>94 Ohio St.3d at 27, 759 N.E.2d 1240; <em>see </em>Crim.R. 52(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">\n<em>a. Misconduct during the trial phase</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b598-10\">{\u00b6 112} Mammone alleges that various incidents of misconduct occurred during the trial phase. First, he argues that the prosecution improperly used certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>evidence and other courtroom techniques to pander to the emotions of the jurors. According to Mammone, his trial was already emotionally charged due to pretrial publicity and the circumstances of the murders. Against that backdrop, he maintains that the prosecution took a \u201chistrionic approach\u201d using excessively emotional arguments, courtroom stunts, and irrelevant evidence. But Mammone does not specifically identify any examples of excessively emotional arguments or courtroom stunts. Instead, his brief argues that the prosecution introduced a variety of irrelevant (and repetitive) evidence in a \u201ccalculated\u201d effort \u201cto evoke an emotional response from the jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">{\u00b6 113} Second, Mammone claims that prosecutorial misconduct occurred when the state offered several additional pieces of \u201cinflammatory\u201d evidence at trial. Mammone argues that this evidence served no legitimate purpose and \u201cinflamed the jury and unnecessarily reminded the jury of the age and helplessness of the victims\u201d at both stages of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">{\u00b6 114} At bottom, these arguments are evidentiary claims. Accordingly, we must determine whether each piece of challenged evidence was properly admitted. Because \u201c[a] trial court enjoys broad discretion in admitting evidence,\u201d \u201c[t]his court will not reject an exercise of this discretion unless it clearly has been abused and the criminal defendant thereby has suffered material prejudice.\u201d <em>State v. Long, </em>53 Ohio St.2d at 98, 372 N.E.2d 804.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">{\u00b6 115} Evidence is relevant, and therefore generally admissible under Evid.R. 402, if it has \u201cany tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\u201d Evid.R. 401. A trial court may exclude relevant evidence if \u201cits probative value is substantially outweighed by considerations of undue delay, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\u201d Evid.R. 403(B). Further, a court <em>must </em>exclude evidence when its \u201cprobative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\u201d Evid.R. 403(A). Contrary to Mammone\u2019s suggestions, neither the Rules of Evidence nor this court\u2019s precedents make \u201cnecessity\u201d a prerequisite for admissibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">{\u00b6 116} If the evidence was properly admitted, then the prosecutor\u2019s decision to offer it cannot form the basis of a misconduct claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-9\">1) Prosecutorial theatrics</p>\n<p id=\"b599-10\">{\u00b6 117} Mammone objects that the prosecution engaged in inappropriate theatrics by introducing specific evidence during the testimony of four witnesses. For the reasons explained below, this evidence was properly admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-11\">{\u00b6 118} First, Mammone argues that the prosecution introduced a photo of Macy and James, dead in their car seats, during Detective Risner\u2019s testimony solely for \u201cshock value.\u201d Risner testified regarding his arrest of Mammone on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>the morning of June 8. While handcuffing Mammone and removing him from his car, Risner looked through the windows and saw a pistol near Mammone\u2019s leg and two dead children strapped in car seats. During Risner\u2019s testimony, the state offered a single photograph depicting the back seat of the car at the time of Mammone\u2019s arrest. The trial court admitted the photo over a defense objection, explaining that it was \u201cnecessary as to what [Risner] observed and [was] not unduly prejudicial given the totality of the testimony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b600-5\">{\u00b6 119} Risner\u2019s testimony and the photo were admissible because they were probative of Mammone\u2019s guilt for the charged offenses. Moreover, as discussed in the analysis of proposition V, the photo satisfies the standard for admitting gruesome photos in capital cases. Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion by permitting this evidence, and the prosecutor did not engage in misconduct by offering it.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">{\u00b6 120} Second, Mammone argues that the prosecution engaged in \u201ctheatrics\u201d by introducing during Detective Weirich\u2019s testimony physical evidence that had been in Mammone\u2019s car when he was arrested. Weirich collected evidence, took photographs, and processed the crime scenes. At trial, Weirich identified the photos and physical evidence, which was important to establish the chain of custody for several of the state\u2019s exhibits. The prosecution introduced items Weirich found in Mammone\u2019s car, including weapons, a wedding photo of Marcia, Marcia\u2019s dried wedding bouquet, car seats, sippy cups, children\u2019s blankets, diapers, sleepers, children\u2019s clothing, and diaper/overnight bags. Mammone did not object to Weirich\u2019s testimony or these exhibits at trial, but he now claims that the physical evidence had no probative value. Mammone reasons that Risner had already described the scene and the jury had already seen the photo of the children dead in their car seats, so the additional evidence was not probative.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-7\">{\u00b6 121} The trial court did not err by admitting this evidence because it was relevant to proving the offenses charged. This physical evidence supported a finding that Mammone acted with purpose when he committed the three murders; he planned ahead for the evening, bringing a host of weapons and supplies for the children with him. In addition, the presence of the wedding bouquet and wedding photo confirms that he acted with Marcia in mind, consistent with his admission that he knew the murders would be a major blow to Marcia, in revenge for their destroyed marriage. Weirich\u2019s description of the scene and the photograph of the children could not simply replace this physical evidence; instead, they supplemented it.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-8\">{\u00b6 122} But even if any of this evidence had been admitted in error, Mammone cannot show that it was outcome-determinative. <em>See </em>Crim.R. 52(B). Mammone gave a full confession to the crimes and, for the most part, did not contest the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>facts of the murders. He cannot persuasively argue that the exclusion of any, or all, of this physical evidence would have led to a different outcome at his trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">{\u00b6 123} Third, Mammone objects to the prosecution\u2019s introduction during Dr. Murthy\u2019s testimony of several autopsy photos of the children as well as the children\u2019s car seats, clothing, and other personal belongings found in Mammone\u2019s car. The trial court admitted the autopsy photos over defense objection, but Mammone did not object to the physical evidence at trial. Mammone now argues that all this evidence was irrelevant and lacked probative value.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">{\u00b6 124} This claim fails. The autopsy photos were properly admitted for the reasons explained in our analysis of proposition V. And the physical evidence collected from Mammone\u2019s car was admissible to illustrate the nature and circumstances of the crime. The car seats and children\u2019s clothing supported Dr. Murthy\u2019s testimony about the state of the children\u2019s bodies when he received them at the coroner\u2019s office. Moreover, even if any of this physical evidence had been improperly admitted, Mammone cannot, establish that the error was outcome-determinative.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-7\">{\u00b6 125} Finally, Mammone argues that it was improper for Michael Short to testify about the children\u2019s bloody car seats. Mammone did not object to this testimony at trial, but he now claims that the testimony was improper for three reasons: (1) two witnesses had already discussed the car seats, (2) the jury did not need Short\u2019s testimony to point out the apparent blood on the car seats, and (3) Short was introduced as a firearms expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-8\">{\u00b6 126} Mammone\u2019s first two arguments fail for several reasons. First, no other witness testified about the car seats from the perspective of a forensic analyst. Instead, a police officer discussed the car seats when describing his activity at the crime scene, and the coroner discussed the car seats because the children arrived at his office in the seats. Second, the fact that a jury can draw its own conclusions by observing physical evidence does not preclude a witness\u2014 particularly a forensic expert \u2014 from testifying about his own conclusions drawn from the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-9\">{\u00b6 127} Mammone also contends that because the court recognized Short as an expert \u201cqualified to render opinions in the area of firearms and fingerprints,\u201d Short could not opine about blood on car seats. Short testified that he is a criminalist with responsibility \u201cfor either assisting with forensic support or actually going out and responding and processing the major crime scenes in Stark County.\u201d He explained that he had examined the car seats for defects such as those consistent with knife slashes and briefly described one of the car seats as \u201csaturated with apparent blood.\u201d The trial court arguably defined Short\u2019s expertise too narrowly or erred by letting him offer expert testimony about the car seats. And if Mammone had objected during the trial, the court easily could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>have addressed these concerns. However, Mammone did not object, and he cannot now establish that but for Short\u2019s testimony about the car seats, the outcome of his trial would have differed.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">{\u00b6 128} For these reasons, the evidence Mammone objected to at trial was properly admitted, and no plain error occurred with regard to evidence that Mammone did not object to at trial. As a result, Mammone\u2019s claim that the prosecutor engaged in improper \u201ctheatrics\u201d by introducing this evidence likewise fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">2) Evidence with no probative value</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">{\u00b6 129} Mammone next argues that misconduct occurred when the prosecutor introduced evidence that allegedly lacked any probative value.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-8\">{\u00b6 130} As an initial matter, Mammone urges us to adopt a higher standard for the admission of \u201chighly inflammatory\u201d evidence in capital cases than the Rules of Evidence demand. We have adopted a stricter standard for admitting gruesome photos in capital cases than in other cases, <em>see Maurer, </em>15 Ohio St.3d 239, 473 N.E.2d 768, at paragraph seven of the syllabus, and Mammone argues that the same standard should also apply to other \u201chighly inflammatory evidence\u201d in capital cases. But we have never applied this heightened standard outside the context of gruesome images of victims, and we see no reason to do so here. <em>See State v. Benner, </em>40 Ohio St.3d 301, 312, 533 N.E.2d 701 (1988) (\u201cunlike gruesome photographs, testimony alleged to be gruesome should not be subjected to the <em>Maurer </em>standard\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b602-9\">{\u00b6 131} First, Mammone objects to \u201c[a]utopsy photos of dead children\u201d and \u201ca photo of dead children in their car seats.\u201d These photos were 'relevant and admissible for the reasons explained in our analysis of proposition Y.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-10\">{\u00b6 132} Second, Mammone objects to the admission of the children\u2019s bloodstained car seats and their belongings found in Mammone\u2019s car. This evidence was relevant and admissible because it was probative of Mammone\u2019s intent and of the manner and circumstances of the children\u2019s deaths. <em>See State v. Cunningham, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 197, 2004-Ohio-7007, 824 N.E.2d 504, \u00b6 65.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-11\">{\u00b6 133} Third, Mammone objects to the admission, during the testimony of Marcia and of Richard Hull, of text messages Mammone exchanged with Marcia and Hull on June 7 and 8, 2009. The messages were relevant and admissible because they were indicative of Mammone\u2019s intent and conduct throughout the events that occurred on those dates.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-12\">{\u00b6 134} Finally, Mammone challenges the admission of the audio recordings of Marcia\u2019s 9-1-1 calls. These recordings were relevant to establish the nature and circumstances of the crimes and to explain the actions of police officers as 'the events transpired.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>{\u00b6 135} None of this evidence was more prejudicial than probative. Nor was it unduly cumulative or repetitive. Instead, this evidence illustrated the testimony of different state witnesses, each of whom contributed to the prosecution\u2019s case against Mammone. And because none of this evidence was erroneously admitted, the prosecution\u2019s decision to introduce it did not deprive Mammone of due process or a fair trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">\n<em>b. Misconduct during the mitigation phase</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b603-7\">{\u00b6 136} Mammone argues in his sixth proposition of law that the prosecutor also committed two instances of misconduct during the mitigation phase, asserting that the prosecutor improperly commented on the fact that Mammone\u2019s expert failed to provide a written report and that the prosecutor improperly argued that Mammone\u2019s desire for revenge against his ex-wife was an aggravating factor. As explained below, however, the prosecutor\u2019s conduct in both regards was well within acceptable bounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-8\">1) Dr. Smalldon\u2019s failure to write a written report</p>\n<p id=\"b603-9\">{\u00b6 137} Mammone objects that the prosecution \u201crepeatedly commented upon Dr. Smalldon\u2019s failure to submit a written report\u201d during cross-examination at the mitigation phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-10\">{\u00b6 138} Dr. Jeffrey Smalldon is a psychologist who testified as a defense expert during the mitigation phase. On cross-examination, the prosecution questioned Dr. Smalldon about his practices with regard to written reports. Through questioning, the state made clear that Dr. Smalldon usually prepares a written report when he is appointed by the court in child-custody and some other cases. By contrast, here Dr. Smalldon was retained by defense counsel and did not write a report. The prosecutor conveyed to the jury that because there was no written report, he had to contact Dr. Smalldon before trial to get some idea of Dr. Smalldon\u2019s likely testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-11\">{\u00b6 139} Mammone argues that this line of questioning amounted to prosecutorial misconduct. In support, he cites <em>State v. Fears, </em>86 Ohio St.3d 329, 715 N.E.2d 136 (1999). In <em>Fears, </em>Dr. Smalldon had interviewed the capital defendant in preparation for mitigation. Dr. Smalldon took notes during the interview, and the prosecution sought access to those notes. The trial court ruled that the state could not see the notes, but \u201c[njevertheless, the prosecutor made several comments about these notes in the presence of the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 334. Over objection, the prosecutor asked Dr. Smalldon whether he had provided his notes to the state and alluded to Dr. Smalldon\u2019s failure to write a report. During closing argument, the prosecutor argued that \u201cSmalldon\u2019s bias was shown by his refusal to give information\u201d \u2014 including his notes \u2014 \u201cto the state.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The trial court \u201csustained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>several defense objections\u201d during the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination of Dr. Smalldon as well as an objection to the prosecutor\u2019s comment about the notes during closing. <em>Id. </em>at 334-335. On review, this court concluded that because the trial court had initially overruled the state\u2019s request for the notes, the prosecutor \u201cshould not have made\u201d the comments he did during closing. <em>Id. </em>at 335. However, even then, we did not find that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks denied Fears a fair trial. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">{\u00b6 140} Mammone maintains that as in <em>Fears, </em>the prosecutor here committed misconduct by \u201cimplying\u201d that Dr. Smalldon\u2019s failure to submit a report \u201cwas improper.\u201d But unlike in <em>Fears, </em>here, the prosecutor\u2019s allegedly improper comments occurred during cross-examination, not during closing arguments <em>after </em>the trial court had already sustained numerous objections to improper cross-examination on the same issue. In addition, in <em>Fears </em>the prosecutor accused Dr. Smalldon of wrongdoing by highlighting his refusal to provide existing materials. By contrast, here the prosecutor simply pointed out Dr. Smalldon\u2019s practice of not generating written reports in cases like this one and did not imply that the practice was irregular or unjustifiable. The prosecutor was entitled to cross-examine Dr. Smalldon about all relevant matters affecting bias and credibility, Evid.R. 611(B), and he did not engage in misconduct by doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">{\u00b6 141} Further, even if the prosecutor\u2019s comments had been improper, Mammone cannot meet the high standard for plain error. The outcome of the trial would not have differed even if this exchange had not occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">2) Revenge as an aggravating circumstance</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">{\u00b6 142} Finally, Mammone contends that the prosecutor improperly argued that revenge was an aggravating circumstance during closing arguments at the mitigation phase. Mammone did not raise this objection at trial, so he has waived all but plain error. <em>See Cunningham, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 197, 2004-Ohio-7007, 824 N.E.2d 504, at \u00b6 89.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">{\u00b6 143} In Ohio, the second phase of a capital trial has a specific purpose: the jury must determine \u201cwhether the aggravating circumstances the offender was found guilty of committing outweigh the mitigating factors\u201d beyond a reasonable doubt. R.C. 2929.03(D)(2). \u201c[T]he \u2018aggravating circumstances\u2019 against which the mitigating evidence is to be weighed <em>are limited to </em>the specifications of aggravating circumstances set forth in R.C. 2929.04(A)(1) through (8) that have been alleged in the indictment and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State v. Wogenstahl, </em>75 Ohio St.3d 344, 662 N.E.2d 311 (1996), paragraph one of the syllabus. The jury shall consider any evidence relevant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>those aggravating circumstances, including evidence about the nature and circumstances of those aggravators. <em>See </em>R.C. 2929.03(D)(1); <em>Wogenstahl </em>at 353.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">{\u00b6 144} As we have long recognized, a prosecutor\u2019s argument during the mitigation phase is restricted to issues germane to the jury\u2019s weighing process. The prosecutor may comment on any \u201ctestimony or evidence relevant to the nature and circumstances of the aggravating circumstances specified in the indictment of which the defendant was found guilty.\u201d <em>State v. Gumm, </em>73 Ohio St.3d 413, 653 N.E.2d 253 (1995), syllabus. However, because the jury is not at liberty to consider nonstatutory aggravating circumstances, the prosecutor cannot argue the existence of nonstatutory aggravating circumstances. <em>See Wogenstahl </em>at 355 (\u201cin the penalty phase of a capital murder trial, any use of the term \u2018aggravating circumstances\u2019 must be confined to the statutory aggravating circumstances set forth in R.C. 2929.04(A)(1) through (8)\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">{\u00b6 145} Mammone claims that the prosecutor argued a nonstatutory aggravating factor \u2014 revenge\u2014in his mitigation-phase closing argument. During closing, the prosecutor discussed the mitigating factors, then asked the jury, \u201cNow, what are the aggravating circumstances that you have to weigh against those mitigating factors?\u201d The challenged portion of the prosecutor\u2019s argument stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-8\">On June 8, 2009, [Mammone] trespassed, by force in the Eakin family home with purpose \u2014 not out of anger, because you don\u2019t drive around the block to see who\u2019s there when you\u2019re angry, ladies and gentlemen. You go, you\u2019re mad, you\u2019re upset. You don\u2019t care who\u2019s there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-9\">But he wanted Margaret alone and as he told police, because that would be a major [blow] to Marcia.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-10\">And in his letter to Marcia, My motivation was to hurt you \u2014 talking about killing Margaret. My motivation was to hurt you and bring forth the despair one feels when the whole family is taken from them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-11\">The whole family. Goes back to his plan, to his course of conduct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-12\">And his purpose when he went in there was to kill Margaret Eakin, that 57-year old former kindergarten teacher who made the holidays so special for James. And he committed that murder during an aggravated burglary.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-13\">And at the same time he committed another aggravating circumstance. Because Margaret was his third victim. She was the third person that this man purposely killed throughout a course of conduct, motivated by the same driving force, to hurt Marcia.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b605-14\">And prior to that he committed this first aggravating circumstance, when as he had planned, he killed his own daughter, Macy, five years old.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>She\u2019d only enjoyed five years on this earth and on that day he decided, James Mammone decided, not a jury, that Macy was to die. She was the first victim in his course of conduct that involved the purposeful killing of three people on the sacred ground that he chose.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-5\">But he wasn\u2019t done yet. No. Because he had also decided that James must die.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-6\">James, who would die at his own father\u2019s hands, because he thought it was necessary. James would become the second victim. Three-year old James, the second victim in this course of conduct, again, driven by that similar motivation, the desire to hurt Marcia.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-7\">Those are the aggravating circumstances that you must now weigh against the mitigating factors.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-8\">And I submit to you, ladies and gentlemen, that this course of conduct was not carried out because of deeply held religious beliefs. This course of conduct was carried out because of * * * [jealousy].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-9\">{\u00b6 146} Contrary to Mammone\u2019s claims, the prosecutor did not improperly refer to nonstatutory aggravating circumstances. The jury had convicted Mammone of a course-of-conduct specification, R.C. 2929.04(A)(5), for each of the three murders, meaning that the jury \u201c \u2018discern[ed] some connection, common scheme, or some pattern or psychological thread\u2019 \u201d that tied the offenses together. <em>State v. Sapp, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 104, 2004-Ohio-7008, 822 N.E.2d 1239, syllabus, quoting <em>State v. Cummings, </em>332 N.C. 487, 510, 422 S.E.2d 692 (1992). In his closing argument at the mitigation phase, the prosecutor argued the nature and circumstances of Mammone\u2019s course-of-conduct specification. Namely, he argued that jealousy and Mammone\u2019s desire to hurt Marcia motivated all three murders. The prosecutor did not suggest that the jury could independently consider revenge as an aggravating circumstance.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-10\">{\u00b6 147} Even if any of the prosecutor\u2019s comments had been improper, Mammone cannot show prejudice because the trial court correctly instructed the jury on the aggravating circumstances and the proper standard to apply in the weighing process. <em>See Cunningham, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 197, 2004-Ohio-7007, 824 N.E.2d 504, at \u00b6 90; <em>State v. Smith, </em>87 Ohio St.3d 424, 444, 721 N.E.2d 93 (2000). It is presumed that the jury followed the court\u2019s instructions. <em>State v. Loza, </em>71 Ohio St.3d 61, 79, 641 N.E.2d 1082 (1994). Accordingly, we find no plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-11\">c. <em>Cumulative effect of prosecutorial misconduct</em></p>\n<p id=\"b606-12\">{\u00b6 148} Finally, Mammone claims that the cumulative effect of \u201c[t]he prosecutor\u2019s misconduct, taken together with the presence of jurors biased in favor of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>death penalty, and the introduction of irrelevant and inflammatory evidence in the trial phase, so infected Mammone\u2019s trial as to result in a deprivation of his rights to due process.\u201d This argument lacks merit. <em>See Cunningham </em>at \u00b6 91; <em>State v. Landrum, </em>53 Ohio St.3d 107, 113, 559 N.E.2d 710 (1990); <em>Smith </em>at 444-445. And to the extent that Mammone more broadly invokes the doctrine of cumulative error, that doctrine does not apply because he cannot point to \u201cmultiple instances of harmless error.\u201d <em>State v. Garner, </em>74 Ohio St.3d 49, 64, 656 N.E.2d 623 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">{\u00b6 149} For all the above reasons, we reject propositions IV and VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">\n<em>3. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b607-7\">{\u00b6 150} In his third proposition of law, Mammone argues that counsel provided constitutionally ineffective assistance throughout the trial. <em>See </em>the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution; Ohio Constitution, Article I, Sections 2, 9, 10, and 16. He identifies three instances of allegedly deficient performance with regard to voir dire, presents a sweeping claim about counsel\u2019s failure to object to improper exhibits and instances of prosecutorial misconduct, asserts that counsel did not properly investigate and prepare for the mitigation phase, and criticizes counsel for allowing Mammone to make a five-hour unsworn statement in mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-8\">{\u00b6 151} To establish ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must both (1) show that counsel\u2019s performance \u201cfell below an objective standard of reasonableness,\u201d as determined by \u201cprevailing professional norms\u201d and (2) demonstrate \u201ca reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 688, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). When performing a <em>Strickland </em>analysis, courts \u201cmust indulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 689.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-9\">\n<em>a. Voir dire</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b607-10\">{\u00b6 152} Mammone contends that counsel rendered ineffective assistance at voir dire by failing to adequately question potential jurors about possible bias in favor of the death penalty, about exposure to pretrial publicity, and about their ability to understand and consider mitigating factors. He also alleges that counsel were ineffective for not challenging jurors for cause on these grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b607-11\">{\u00b6 153} When evaluating claims of ineffective assistance at voir dire, this court has \u201cconsistently declined to \u2018second-guess trial strategy decisions\u2019 or impose \u2018hindsight views about how current counsel might have voir dired the jury differently.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Mundt, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 22, 2007-Ohio-4836, 873 N.E.2d 828, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>\u00b6 63, quoting <em>State v. Mason, </em>82 Ohio St.3d 144, 157, 694 N.E.2d 932 (1998). Decisions about voir dire are highly subjective and prone to individual attorney strategy because they are often based on intangible factors. <em>Mundt </em>at \u00b6 64, citing <em>Miller v. Francis, </em>269 F.3d 609, 620 (6th Cir.2001). Accordingly, \u201ccounsel is in the best position to determine whether any potential juror should be questioned and to what extent.\u201d <em>State v. Murphy, </em>91 Ohio St.3d 516, 539, 747 N.E.2d 765 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-5\">{\u00b6 154} First, Mammone argues that counsel did not adequately question or challenge two jurors, juror Nos. 418 and 448, for cause. According to Mammone, these two jurors \u201cclearly indicated during voir dire that they could not fairly consider all the possible sentencing options in this case.\u201d But counsel did not provide deficient performance in this regard because, as explained in our analysis of proposition II, these jurors\u2019 views on the death penalty <em>were </em>extensively probed during voir dire. Neither party, nor the judge, expressed reservations that either juror No. 418 or No. 448 was biased in favor of the death penalty. And even now, Mammone does not identify any questions that counsel <em>should </em>have asked during voir dire. Under these circumstances, we find that counsel\u2019s decision not to inquire further was objectively reasonable. In fact, defense counsel could well have made a strategic decision not to challenge either juror for cause. <em>See State v. Cornwell, </em>86 Ohio St.3d 560, 569, 715 N.E.2d 1144 (1999) (\u201cwe will not second-guess trial strategy decisions such as those made in voir dire\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b608-6\">{\u00b6 155} Second, Mammone argues that counsel failed to adequately voir dire and challenge jurors as to pretrial publicity. As discussed in the analysis of proposition I, every potential juror completed a publicity questionnaire and was questioned about exposure to publicity during voir dire. Thus, counsel\u2019s failure to ask additional questions was not objectively unreasonable. Moreover, the trial court, which was in the best \u201cposition to judge each juror\u2019s demeanor and-fairness,\u201d concluded that every juror and alternate selected \u2014 including the four Mammone specifically expresses concern about \u2014 could be fair and impartial. <em>State v. Trimble, </em>122 Ohio St.3d 297, 2009-Ohio-2961,- 911 N.E.2d 242, at \u00b6 64. Accordingly, counsel\u2019s performance was not deficient in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-7\">{\u00b6 156} Finally, Mammone argues that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient in failing \u201cto voir dire jurors as to their ability to consider mitigating factors.\u201d The record indicates that the prosecutor thoroughly explained mitigation to the jurors and questioned them about whether they would be able to balance the aggravating circumstances against mitigating factors. Defense counsel then posed additional questions about possible mitigating factors, and the trial court itself inquired further when necessary. The fact that defense counsel did not decide to ask additional questions or to press every single potential juror on this issue \u2014 or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>to inquire about specific mitigating factors \u2014 is reasonable as a matter of strategy. <em>See Murphy, </em>91 Ohio St.3d at 539, 747 N.E.2d 765.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\">{\u00b6 157} Even if counsel\u2019s performance at voir dire had been deficient in one or more of these ways, Mammone cannot establish prejudice under <em>Strickland. </em>He has failed to establish a reasonable probability that but for counsel\u2019s allegedly deficient performance at voir dire, the result of the trial would have been different. <em>See, e.g., State v. Adams, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 508, 2004-Ohio-5845, 817 N.E.2d 29, at \u00b6 67.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-6\">{\u00b6 158} For these reasons, we find that counsel did not render ineffective assistance during voir dire.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">\n<em>b. Failure to object</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b609-8\">{\u00b6 159} In conjunction with propositions IV and VI, Mammone argues that counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to object to allegedly improper exhibits and instances of prosecutorial misconduct. As explained above, we reject Mammone\u2019s evidentiary claims and allegations of prosecutorial misconduct. Accordingly, he cannot establish ineffective assistance in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-9\">c. <em>Mitigation investigation and preparation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b609-10\">{\u00b6 160} Mammone contends that counsel also provided ineffective assistance during the second phase of his trial by failing to properly interview and prepare the defense\u2019s mitigation witnesses. Mammone asserts that information harmful to his mitigation defense emerged during the prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination of his mother, Gilise Mammone, and during the direct testimony of his father, James Mammone Jr.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-11\">{\u00b6 161} On direct examination, Gilise testified that Mammone regretted his actions and knew that what he did was wrong. But on cross-examination, she did not effectively dispute the prosecutor\u2019s allegation that Mammone continued to maintain that he had no regrets. She also did not dispute that Mammone had told her that Marcia \u201cgot exactly what she was told she would get,\u201d and she conceded that \u201c[f]rom what he tells me, he\u2019s warned her and warned her about it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b609-12\">{\u00b6 162} Mammone argues that the jury would not have heard this harmful testimony if counsel had fully interviewed Gilise before the hearing and better prepared her to testify. But there is no evidence that counsel did not fully interview Gilise or adequately prepare her. To establish that \u201cwould require proof outside the record,\u201d and such a claim \u201cis not appropriately considered on a direct appeal.\u201d <em>State v. Madrigal, </em>87 Ohio St.3d 378, 391, 721 N.E.2d 52 (2000). Further, Mammone\u2019s counsel may have been aware of potential pitfalls in Gilise\u2019s testimony but nevertheless still made a reasonable strategic decision to put her <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>on the stand. <em>See State v. Conway, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 412, 2006-Ohio-2815, 848 N.E.2d 810, at \u00b6 115 (counsel\u2019s decision to call a witness \u201creflected reasonable trial strategy\u201d). Gilise had valuable information to offer the jury about Mammone\u2019s childhood and history of abuse, and counsel may have decided that the information was more important than avoiding potentially unfavorable testimony on cross-examination. Therefore, Mammone cannot show that counsel were deficient in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\">{\u00b6 163} Further, Mammone cannot show a reasonable likelihood that but for counsel\u2019s alleged error, he would not have been sentenced to death. Mammone argues that Gilise conveyed two facts to the jury: (1) that Mammone felt that Marcia got what she deserved and did not regret the murders of the children and (2) that Mammone had repeatedly warned Marcia that there would be grave consequences for her actions. But Mammone\u2019s unsworn statement and Dr. Smalldon\u2019s testimony conveyed essentially the same information to the jury. Gilise\u2019s testimony in this regard was merely cumulative and does not provide a sufficient basis for establishing prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-6\">{\u00b6 164} Mammone similarly argues that counsel\u2019s mitigation investigation and preparation of his father, James Jr., was deficient because his father\u2019s testimony directly contradicted the defense\u2019s narrative about Mammone\u2019s difficult childhood and relationship with his father. James Jr. testified that he had a good relationship with Mammone when he was a child and denied abusing him or calling him names (at least often). He also made what Mammone characterizes as \u201cbizarre and unfocused comments,\u201d which Mammone argues detracted from his mitigation case.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-7\">{\u00b6 165} As with Gilise, Mammone cannot establish that counsel were deficient in preparing James Jr. to testify or that counsel were deficient in allowing him to testify at all. First, there is no evidence that counsel did not fully interview James Jr. or prepare him to testify. Second, counsel may have reasonably decided to put James Jr. on the stand in spite of some apparent contradictions between his testimony and the defense\u2019s mitigation theory. <em>See Conway, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 412, 2006-Ohio-2815, 848 N.E.2d 810, at \u00b6 115. James Jr. denied abusing Mammone, but he also candidly admitted that he drank frequently and that he recalled striking Gilise a few times. He also admitted that he regularly blacked out in those days, so that there was much he did not remember about this time period. In light of these statements, defense counsel could reasonably have decided that James Jr.\u2019s testimony would do more good than harm.</p>\n<p id=\"b610-8\">{\u00b6 166} Even if counsel\u2019s preparation of James Jr. had been somehow deficient, however, Mammone cannot establish that but for this error, there is a reasonable likelihood that he would have received a life sentence. Much of James Jr.\u2019s testimony was consistent with Mammone\u2019s mitigation theory and when it was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>inconsistent, Mammone had three witnesses to support his version of events \u2014 his mother, Dr. Smalldon, and himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-6\">{\u00b6 167} In sum, Mammone cannot establish that counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to adequately interview his mitigation witnesses or prepare them for the mitigation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-7\">\n<em>d. Mammone\u2019s unsworn statement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b611-8\">{\u00b6 168} Mammone argues that counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to prepare him for mitigation, by allowing him to make a five-hour unsworn statement, and by failing to limit or guide his statement in any way.</p>\n<p id=\"b611-9\">{\u00b6 169} At his mitigation hearing, Mammone presented a lengthy unsworn statement \u2014 spanning more than 250 pages in the transcript \u2014 that described his upbringing, his relationships with Marcia and his children, the events leading up to June 7 and 8, 2009, and the murders themselves. He began by stating that his intent was to give the jury \u201ca firsthand account of what I did and how I was feeling and thinking at the time.\u201d He concluded by saying that he is full of regrets and expressing hope that others will learn from this tragedy by renewing their commitments to God, their marriage, and their children. Ultimately, the court directed Mammone to \u201c[w]rap it up,\u201d and he responded by stating, \u201cI\u2019ve said my piece, Judge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b611-10\">{\u00b6 170} Mammone cannot establish that counsel were ineffective by allowing him to make this long unsworn statement. Mammone, <em>\u201cnot counsel, </em>had the choice whether to testify or give an unsworn statement.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>State v. Brooks, </em>75 Ohio St.3d 148, 157, 661 N.E.2d 1030 (1996). And regardless, \u201cthe decision to give an unsworn statement is a tactical one, a call best made by those at the trial who can judge the tenor of the trial and the mood of the jury.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b611-11\">{\u00b6 171} Mammone\u2019s statement was well spoken, coherent, and organized. For the most part, the statement amplified the confession Mammone had made to police officers the day he was arrested and gave the jury an opportunity to observe his personality and learn more about his background. Moreover, because the court permitted Dr. Smalldon to observe the statement, Dr. Smalldon was able to refer to it during his own testimony. Under the circumstances, to the extent that trial counsel may have influenced Mammone\u2019s decision to give an unsworn statement, allowing the statement was objectively reasonable as a matter of strategy. <em>See State v. Jalowiec, </em>91 Ohio St.3d 220, 237, 744 N.E.2d 163 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b611-12\">{\u00b6 172} Moreover, even if counsel had somehow performed deficiently with regard to Mammone\u2019s unsworn statement, this conduct was not prejudicial. Mammone speculates that the statement was harmful because it was long, cold, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>and detached and because the jury had no context for connecting it to Mammone\u2019s mental illness. But Mammone cannot establish a reasonable likelihood that he would have been sentenced to life imprisonment if not for this statement. For the most part, Mammone\u2019s statement amplified his confession statement to police officers, which was played for the jury at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-5\">e. <em>Cumulative errors</em></p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">{\u00b6 173} Finally, Mammone argues that trial counsel\u2019s cumulative errors and omissions violated his constitutional rights. However, because none of Mammone\u2019s individual claims of ineffective assistance has merit, he cannot establish an entitlement to relief simply by joining those claims together.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">{\u00b6 174} For all these reasons, we deny Mammone\u2019s ineffective-assistance claims and reject his third proposition of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">C. Challenges to the Death Penalty</p>\n<p id=\"A0I\">\n<em>1. Cruel and Unusual Punishment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">{\u00b6 175} In his eighth proposition of law, Mammone argues that his death sentence violates the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments because he is \u201cseriously mentally ill.\u201d We reject this claim because the Eighth Amendment does not bar the execution of the seriously mentally ill and, in any event, Mammone has not shown that he suffers from a \u201cserious mental illness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b612-10\">{\u00b6 176} As interpreted by the United States Supreme Court, the Eighth Amendment\u2019s prohibition on \u201ccruel and unusual punishments\u201d requires that the \u201cpunishment for crime * * * be graduated and proportioned to [the] offense.\u201d <em>Weems v. United States, </em>217 U.S. 349, 367, 30 S.Ct. 544, 54 L.Ed. 793 (1910). As \u201cthe most severe punishment,\u201d the death penalty is \u201creserved for a narrow category of crimes and offenders.\u201d <em>Roper v. Simmons, </em>543 U.S. 551, 568, 569, 125 S.Ct. 1183, 161 L.Ed.2d 1 (2005). Accordingly, the United States Supreme Court has identified three categories of offenders who cannot be sentenced to death consistent with the Eighth Amendment: juveniles, the insane, and the mentally retarded. <em>Id. </em>at 578 (abrogating <em>Stanford v. Kentucky, </em>492 U.S. 361, 109 S.Ct. 2969, 106 L.Ed.2d 306 (1989)); <em>Ford v. Wainwright, </em>477 U.S. 399, 106 S.Ct. 2595, 91 L.Ed.2d 335 (1986); <em>Atkins v. Virginia, </em>536 U.S. 304, 122 S.Ct. 2242, 153 L.Ed.2d 335 (2002) (abrogating <em>Penry v. Lynaugh, </em>492 U.S. 302, 109 S.Ct. 2934, 106 L.Ed.2d 256 (1989)).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-11\">{\u00b6 177} Mammone does not (and does not claim to) fit any of these categories. Instead, he urges this court to extend the Eighth Amendment\u2019s protections to a fourth category of offenders: defendants with severe mental illness. Mammone in effect argues that the Eighth Amendment protections can change over time because the amendment \u201cdraw[s] its meaning from the evolving standards of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.\u201d <em>Trop v. Dulles, </em>356 U.S. 86, 101, 78 S.Ct. 590, 2 L.Ed.2d 630 (1958) (Warren, C.J., plurality opinion). In light of present \u201cstandards of decency,\u201d Mammone would have us hold that the Eighth Amendment bars capital punishment for offenders with serious mental problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">{\u00b6 178} Mammone cites two concurring opinions in support of his argument. <em>State v. Lang, </em>129 Ohio St.3d 512, 2011-Ohio-4215, 954 N.E.2d 596, \u00b6 343-367 (Lundberg Stratton, J., concurring); <em>State v. Ketterer, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 70, 2006-Ohio-5283, 855 N.E.2d 48, \u00b6 210-250 (Lundberg Stratton, J., concurring). But these opinions do not support Mammone\u2019s- claim of an Eighth Amendment violation. Instead, they speak to policy matters. Justice Lundberg Stratton did not interpret the Eighth Amendment to bar the execution of the severely mentally ill. She noted that \u201c \u2018mental illnesses vary widely in severity\u2019 \u201d and that \u201c \u2018[t]he General Assembly would be the proper body to * * * take public testimony, hear from experts in the field, and fashion criteria for the judicial system to apply.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lang </em>at \u00b6 365 (Lundberg Stratton, J., concurring), quoting <em>Ketterer </em>at \u00b6 248 (Lundberg Stratton, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-7\">{\u00b6 179} Neither the United States Supreme Court nor any other court has ever recognized the seriously mentally ill as a category of offenders who cannot be constitutionally executed. <em>See State v. Dunlap, </em>155 Idaho 345, 380, 313 P.3d 1 (2013) (\u201cIt appears that every court that has considered this issue [has] refused to extend <em>Atkins </em>and hold that the Eighth Amendment categorically prohibits execution of the mentally ill\u201d). Likewise, we have repeatedly rejected claims that executing a severely mentally ill person constitutes cruel and unusual punishment. <em>See, e.g., Ketterer </em>at \u00b6 176; <em>State v. Hancock, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 57, 2006-Ohio-160, 840 N.E.2d 1032, \u00b6 155 (\u201cWe have found no court that has held that it violates the Eighth Amendment to impose a death sentence on a defe.nda.nt who was severely mentally ill at the time of the offense\u201d [footnote omitted]).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">{\u00b6 180} In addition, there is tremendous variation in the types and degrees of mental illness. <em>See Hancock </em>at \u00b6 157 (\u201cMental illnesses come in many forms; different illnesses may affect a defendant\u2019s moral responsibility or deterrability in different ways and to different degrees\u201d). It is therefore fitting that Ohio\u2019s sentencing statutes permit consideration of mental illness on a case-by-case basis. Evidence of mental illness is relevant during sentencing under R.C. 2929.04(B)(3) and (B)(7), thereby allowing for \u201cthe individualized balancing] between aggravation and mitigation in a specific case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 158. Here, defense counsel presented evidence about Mammone\u2019s mental illness in mitigation, and the jury and trial court weighed that information when determining his sentence. We will again weigh that evidence during our independent sentence evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>{\u00b6 181} Even if we had some inclination to interpret the Eighth Amendment more broadly, we are unconvinced that Mammone has a \u201cserious mental illness.\u201d Dr. Smalldon testified that Mammone has a personality disorder (not otherwise specified) with schizotypal, borderline, and narcissistic features. He further stated that Mammone also has passive-aggressive and compulsive personality traits, as well as some traits that are commonly associated with psychotics. Regardless of how \u201cserious mental illness\u201d is defined, Mammone\u2019s mental problems are less severe than those of defendants in other cases in which we have rejected Eighth Amendment challenges. <em>See, e.g., Ketterer, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 70, 2006-Ohio-5283, 855 N.E.2d 48, at \u00b6 211 (Lundberg Stratton, J., concurring) (noting that the state did not contest the defendant\u2019s serious mental illness, including bipolar disorder, substance-abuse problems, and multiple past suicide attempts); <em>State v. Scott, </em>92 Ohio St.3d 1, 2, 748 N.E.2d 11 (2001) (rejecting Eighth Amendment challenge to execution of \u201cany person with a biologically based severe mental illness such as schizophrenia\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">{\u00b6 182} For all these reasons, we reject proposition of law VIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">\n<em>2. Constitutional and International-Law Challenges</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b614-7\">{\u00b6 183} In his ninth proposition of law, Mammone presents seven often raised \u2014 and always rejected \u2014 constitutional challenges to Ohio\u2019s capital-punishment scheme. He also argues that Ohio\u2019s death-penalty statutes violate international law and treaties and therefore offend the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-8\">{\u00b6 184} The court has previously considered and rejected each of these claims:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b614-9\">\u2022 Ohio\u2019s death-penalty scheme is not imposed in an arbitrary and discriminatory manner. <em>State v.

Fry, </em>125 Ohio St.3d 163, 2010-Ohio-1017, 926 N.E.2d 1239, \u00b6 215-216; <em>State v. Davis, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 404, 2008-Ohio-2, 880 N.E.2d 31, \u00b6 381-383; <em>State v.

In addition, we have \u201crejected the argument that Ohio\u2019s death penalty statutes are in violation of treaties to which the United States is a signatory\u201d and thus have held that the statutes do not offend the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution. <em>Bey, </em>85 Ohio St.3d at 502, 709 N.E.2d 484.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-12\">{\u00b6 187} Mammone\u2019s ninth proposition of law is not well taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-13\">III. INDEPENDENT SENTENCE EVALUATION</p>\n<p id=\"b615-14\">{\u00b6 188} Finally, Mammone argues in his seventh proposition of law that his death sentences were unreliable and inappropriate. This claim invokes R.C. 2929.05(A), which requires us to review Mammone\u2019s death sentences for appropri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>ateness and proportionality. In conducting this review, we must determine whether the evidence supports the jury\u2019s finding of aggravating circumstances, whether the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating factors, and whether Mammone\u2019s death sentence is proportionate to those affirmed in similar cases. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">A. Aggravating Circumstances</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">{\u00b6 189} Mammone was convicted of two death specifications for each count of aggravated murder. The jury found that Mammone killed all three victims as \u201cpart of a course of conduct involving the purposeful killing of or attempt to kill two or more persons by the offender.\u201d R.C. 2929.04(A)(5). With respect to Macy and James, the jury also found a violation of R.C. 2929.04(A)(9), murdering a child under the age of 13. And with respect to Margaret, the jury found that the murder occurred during an aggravated burglary, in violation of R.C. 2929.04(A)(7). The evidence at trial supports the jury\u2019s finding of all these aggravating circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">{\u00b6 190} First, the murders of Margaret, Macy, and James were purposeful and part of a single continuing course of conduct. The attacks were linked in time and motive. <em>See State v. Sapp, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 104, 2004-Ohio-7008, 822 N.E.2d 1239, at syllabus and \u00b6 52 (factors such as time, location, a common scheme, or a common psychological thread can establish the factual link necessary to prove a course of conduct). In addition, Mammone\u2019s conduct was purposeful. He contemplated violent revenge for months. On June 7, 2009, he packed a bag of weapons and loaded Macy and James into his car. After driving around for hours, Mammone parked and stabbed his children as they sat strapped in their car seats. He then drove to Margaret\u2019s house, where he beat her and fatally shot her twice. Hours later, Mammone confessed to all three murders and agreed that they were all motivated, at least in part, by his desire to hurt Marcia. This evidence supports Mammone\u2019s conviction under R.C. 2929.04(A)(5) with respect to each of the three counts of aggravated murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">{\u00b6 191} Second, Mammone murdered children under the age of 13 when he killed Macy and James. Before trial, Mammone stipulated that his children were five and three years old at the time of their deaths. Accordingly, the evidence supports Mammone\u2019s conviction under R.C. 2929.04(A)(9) for two of the three counts of aggravated murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-8\">{\u00b6 192} Finally, the evidence shows that Mammone murdered Margaret during an aggravated burglary. R.C. 2911.11(A) defines aggravated burglary as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-9\">(A) No person, by force, stealth, or deception, shall trespass in an occupied structure * * *, when another person other than an accomplice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>of the offender is present, with purpose to commit in the structure * * * any criminal offense, if any of the following apply:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-5\">(1) The offender inflicts, or attempts or threatens to inflict physical harm on another;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b617-6\">(2) The offender has a deadly weapon or dangerous ordnance on or about the offender\u2019s person or under the offender\u2019s control.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b617-7\">Mammone committed aggravated burglary when he entered the Eakins\u2019 occupied home, with the intent to harm Margaret, while carrying a deadly weapon. Mammone located Margaret, then shot and beat her, causing her death. There is no question that Mammone was the principal offender in this murder; nothing suggests that any other offender was involved. Accordingly, the evidence supports the jury\u2019s finding of felony murder. <em>See </em>R.C. 2929.04(A)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">B. Mitigating Factors</p>\n<p id=\"b617-9\">{\u00b6 193} For each murder count, we must weigh the applicable aggravating circumstances against any mitigating evidence about the \u201cnature and circumstances of the offense\u201d and Mammone\u2019s \u201chistory, character, and background.\u201d R.C. 2929.04(B). In addition, we consider the statutory mitigating factors set forth in the subsections of R.C. 2929.04(B): (B)(1) (victim inducement), (B)(2) (duress, coercion, or strong provocation), (B)(3) (mental disease or defect), (B)(4) (youth of the offender), (B)(5) (lack of a significant criminal record), (B)(6) (accomplice rather than principal offender), and (B)(7) (any other relevant factors).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-10\">{\u00b6 194} At the mitigation hearing, the defense presented Mammone\u2019s unsworn statement, testimony from his parents, and testimony from defense expert psychologist Dr. Jeffrey Smalldon.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-11\">\n<em>1. Mammone\u2019s Unsworn Statement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b617-12\">{\u00b6 195} In his unsworn statement, Mammone told the jury about his background, described the events leading up to June 7 and 8, 2009, and gave \u201ca firsthand account\u201d of what he did and how he was feeling and thinking at the time of the murders.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-13\">{\u00b6 196} Mammone was born in Canton in 1973 and lived in that area most of his life. When Mammone was a child, his father drank excessively and regularly beat his wife and son severely. By the time Mammone was five or six years old, he was \u201chorrified to go home.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b617-14\">{\u00b6 197} Mammone\u2019s parents divorced when he was ten years old and his father, James Jr., moved back in with his own parents. Mammone\u2019s mother, Gilise, struggled financially and became depressed. Mammone, who had always been a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>strong student, lost interest in school and also became depressed. In 1986, Gilise began to date a neighbor, and she and her son eventually moved in with the neighbor. Mammone was extremely jealous and believed that his mother was being mentally controlled. He began to spend more time at his paternal grandparents\u2019 house. His relationship with his father improved, and he became very close to his grandfather, who had always treated Mammone like a son. One of Mammone\u2019s grandmothers took him to church with her and taught him strong values. Around this time, Mammone began to develop \u201ca complex\u201d about how his family wasn\u2019t the way that he \u201cthought families should be.\u201d As a teenager, Mammone had several close friends. He began working at age 16 and held a steady succession of jobs. At age 18, Mammone left home and lived with a friend for a short time before moving in with his paternal grandparents. He also met Richard Hull, and the two quickly became inseparable.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-5\">{\u00b6 198} Mammone and Marcia met while working at a restaurant, and they began dating in February 1996. They shared the same views about commitment and God. Mammone respected Marcia\u2019s family, and he began attending church with them. The couple married in December 1998. At some point, Marcia mentioned that she could imagine leaving Mammone if he were to make a certain kind of financial mistake with their money. This comment shocked Mammone, and he became insecure about the marriage. He questioned whether they should have children, because he believed that children should be raised only in a home with both parents present as husband and wife. Marcia assuaged Mammone\u2019s fears and reiterated her commitment to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">{\u00b6 199} Macy was born on March 22, 2004, and James IV was born on May 5, 2006. Marcia was overwhelmed after Macy\u2019s birth and even more overwhelmed after James was born. She started seeing a psychologist, but Mammone rejected the idea of joint marriage counseling. Eventually he agreed to see a psychological counselor on his own, but his counseling was not helpful and his relationship with Marcia deteriorated.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">{\u00b6 200} In spring 2007, Marcia got drunk at a party and informed her work colleagues that Mammone did not want Macy and James to be around them because many of them \u201chad been divorced and had children who were being raised in broken homes.\u201d This statement was true: Mammone did not \u201cwant [his] children in that environment.\u201d However, he had great difficulty explaining his views to Marcia\u2019s coworkers, some of whom he regarded as friends. Marcia felt more and more isolated and believed that Mammone was too judgmental.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">{\u00b6 201} On August 3, 2007, Marcia announced that she was leaving Mammone. Mammone reminded her that he would never let the children be raised in a home without both parents living together. Marcia told him that she already felt like a single mother and that she would rather just be one. Mammone refused to let <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>Marcia leave the house. He blocked the door and crushed her phone. By the end of the day, Mammone agreed to enter marriage counseling, and the couple committed to making the marriage work.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">{\u00b6 202} Mammone experienced a nervous breakdown. He quit his job and did not feel like leaving the house for several months.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">{\u00b6 203} In December 2007, Mammone got drunk at a Cleveland Browns game. He became very upset with Marcia and warned her, \u201cIf you try to leave me, you know, I\u2019ll kill you and I\u2019ll kill the kids.\u201d He assured her that he would \u201csend the children back to heaven to be with God\u201d because, as he had previously told her, he \u201cwould absolutely see [them] dead before I would see them go through what I know to be the tragedies of a broken home.\u201d Unbeknownst to Mammone at the time, Marcia contacted a lawyer soon after the Browns game. She also secretly started setting money aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">{\u00b6 204} One morning in summer 2008, Mammone saw Marcia decline a phone call. He took Marcia\u2019s phone, called the number on it, and was connected to a lawyer\u2019s office. Marcia then told Mammone that she was leaving him. Mammone threatened Marcia, but he did not really intend to hurt her. Later that day, Marcia was driving the family to the Eakins\u2019 house when they passed a police officer. Marcia yelled for help and Mammone was arrested. He was charged with verbal domestic violence and briefly jailed for threatening to kill Marcia. By the time Mammone was released, Marcia and the children had left on a trip to New York. Marcia later got a protection order and Mammone attended court-ordered domestic-violence therapy. After his arrest, Mammone experienced another nervous breakdown. He felt shocked, depressed, betrayed, and abandoned. Mammone assembled a shrine to Marcia in the living room of the house that they had formerly shared, with items such as her wedding photo and bridal bouquet.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">{\u00b6 205} Mammone \u201ccouldn\u2019t stop thinking about violent means\u201d of revenge. He bought a pickax, a machete-like tool, and a shovel handle at a farming supply store. He then sat in front of his living room shrine and drove long nails through the shovel handle to create a weapon. Throughout the summer, Mammone spoke to various people \u2014 including Richard Hull, another friend, and his lawyer \u2014 about his desire to kill Marcia, but he did not mention anything about killing his children.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">{\u00b6 206} Mammone tried to keep tabs on Marcia and the children throughout the summer. When he questioned Marcia about her social life, she told him to mind his own business. In response, Mammone once unsuccessfully tried to enter the Eakins\u2019 house with a baseball bat.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>{\u00b6 207} Mammone eventually got supervised visitation with Macy and James and, later, overnight visitation. But Mammone only became more upset and frustrated about the situation, and his thoughts grew increasingly violent.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">{\u00b6 208} On June 7, 2009, Mammone picked up Macy and James at the Eakins\u2019 house for an overnight visit. He and the children drove by Marcia\u2019s apartment and saw a truck in the driveway. When they drove by again, the truck was gone, so Mammone went looking for it.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">{\u00b6 209} Mammone began to text Marcia and became increasingly angry with her responses. Back at his apartment, Mammone filled a blue bag with the contents of a kitchen drawer, including tongs and a meat shears. He eventually also collected two knives, a handgun, a large wedding photo of Marcia, and Marcia\u2019s wedding bouquet. Mammone took a valium and drank half a bottle of wine. According to Mammone, \u201c[A]t this point in time I had concluded that * * * that night I was going to kill the children.\u201d He took all the supplies, loaded the children into his Oldsmobile, and began driving around.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">{\u00b6 210} Mammone continued to text Marcia. Around 3:30 a.m. on June 8, he decided to burn the truck that was parked in Marcia\u2019s driveway and went to his apartment for additional supplies.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">{\u00b6 211} Later, Mammone parked at the church. He pulled out a knife and plunged it into Macy\u2019s neck three or four times as she slept. He simultaneously severed Macy\u2019s jugular vein and brain stem because he wanted to kill her instantly. Mammone cut James at a different angle. Then he got back in the car, said a prayer, and started driving again.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-9\">{\u00b6 212} At a stop sign, Mammone looked back at his children and felt a surge of aggression that caused him to contemplate killing his wife\u2019s parents. He drove to the Eakins\u2019 house, grabbed the pistol, and cocked the hammer. Mammone ran upstairs and found Margaret lying on the bed in the guest bedroom. He shot her right shoulder. The gun jammed, so Mammone hit Margaret\u2019s face with the gun and a lamp. Mammone unjammed the gun and shot Margaret again, in the face.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-10\">{\u00b6 213} Next, Mammone drove to Marcia\u2019s apartment. He doused the truck that was parked there with gasoline, but his lighter fell apart. Mammone smashed in Marcia\u2019s back door and entered the apartment. Eventually, he left the apartment and threw a bat at Marcia\u2019s window before deciding to drive away.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-11\">{\u00b6 214} Mammone drove back to the church, where he called his mother and confessed that he had committed the three murders. He drove around for a time, took a dozen pills, and drank some wine. He left three voice mails for Hull. But \u2014 contrary to what Mammone said in one message to Hull \u2014 he had not actually decided a year earlier that what he had done would be the best way to get revenge on Marcia.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>{\u00b6 215} Mammone knew the detectives who interviewed him after his arrest. He felt comfortable with them and wanted to talk about what had happened. According to Mammone, he has plenty of regrets now. But he hopes that his children\u2019s deaths will encourage others to be fully committed to their marriages and their families.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">\n<em>2. Testimony of James Mammone Jr.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">{\u00b6 216} Mammone\u2019s father, James Jr., testified that he married Gilise in 1973, three months before Mammone\u2019s birth. The couple divorced when Mammone was ten, and James Jr. moved back to his parents\u2019 house.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">{\u00b6 217} James Jr. has been antisocial for about 15 years. He was unemployed at the time of the trial and prefers to be by himself. Although he lived only ten minutes away from Mammone for many years, they had not spoken since before Macy was born. Mammone stopped seeing James Jr. after James Jr. refused to come to the hospital when Macy was born.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">{\u00b6 218} James Jr. believed that he had a close relationship with Mammone when he was a child. He admitted to calling his son a \u201cmaggot,\u201d but he does not recall using this nickname often or in a particularly derogatory way or calling Mammone stupid. James Jr. was sad to hear that Mammone and his mother thought he was abusive, though he did recall striking his wife at least once or twice while Mammone was present. He testified that there is a lot that he does not remember, however, because at that time of his life he drank five to nine beers most nights and regularly blacked out.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-10\">{\u00b6 219} James Jr. stated that when he was a child, his own father \u201cwas a major drunk\u201d who regularly passed out at the steering wheel of his car. But James Jr. acknowledged that Mammone had a very good relationship with James Jr.\u2019s father.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-11\">\n<em>3. Testimony of Gilise Mammone</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b621-12\">{\u00b6 220} Gilise and James Jr. married in 1973 and divorced in 1984, when Mammone was ten years old. Gilise entered another relationship about four years later and had been with the same man for 22 years by the time of Mammone\u2019s trial. Gilise testified that James Jr. was a \u201cpretty bad drinker\u201d who mentally and physically abused her and Mammone. James Jr. called Gilise names and found it amusing to call Mammone a \u201cmaggot.\u201d He beat Gilise (sometimes making Mammone watch) and physically harmed Mammone.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-13\">{\u00b6 221} Although Mammone\u2019s relationship with his father was poor, he had a good relationship with his grandparents, especially his paternal grandfather and maternal grandmother. He was much closer to Gilise than to James Jr. As an only child, Mammone spent a lot of time alone in his room. But Gilise testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>that he was a smart child who got along well with other children. He was always with friends and treated them like brothers.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">{\u00b6 222} Gilise did not realize that Mammone and Marcia were having serious marital problems until Mammone was arrested for domestic violence. Marcia had complained that Mammone worked too much, but Gilise thought that her son had a wonderful relationship with Macy and James.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-6\">{\u00b6 223} Gilise stated her opinion that Mammone knew that he had done something wrong and regretted it, though he had not expressly told her so. On cross-examination, she explained that Mammone had called her from jail and gave her the impression that he had felt that murder was his only option. She recalls telling Mammone that Marcia had made a costly decision. But she was clear that she did not consider the murders to be Marcia\u2019s fault and stated that Mammone was \u201cthe only person at fault here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">\n<em>4. Testimony of Dr. Smalldon</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">{\u00b6 224} Psychologist Jeffrey Smalldon testified about his extensive and wide-ranging psychological evaluation of Mammone. Dr. Smalldon never doubted Mammone\u2019s competence to stand trial. He testified that Mammone knew the difference between right and wrong when he committed the murders, but he opined that Mammone was experiencing extreme emotional distress and suffering from a severe mental disorder.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">{\u00b6 225} As a child, Mammone was a bright but chronically underachieving student. Mammone and his mother both told Dr. Smalldon that he was abused by his father, but they also related that the abuse ended when the parents divorced when Mammone was age ten. On cross-examination, Dr. Smalldon admitted that he had no independent confirmation of abuse other than Mammone\u2019s and Gilise\u2019s allegations. Mammone has worked steadily since age 16 except for a few brief periods of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-10\">{\u00b6 226} Dr. Smalldon described an odd interview that he had conducted with Mammone\u2019s father, James Jr., for 40 minutes outside James Jr.\u2019s home on a frigid day during the winter while James Jr. was wearing only shorts. James Jr. had explained that he does not like to be around people and that he rarely leaves the house. Because James Jr. would not come to the hospital to see Macy when she was born, Mammone had not spoken to him in about five years. James Jr. indicated that he did not \u201csee what the big deal is about children.\u201d He denied abusing Mammone.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-11\">{\u00b6 227} Dr. Smalldon opined that Mammone was profoundly affected by his father frequently calling him names like \u201cmaggot\u201d and \u201closer\u201d as a child. Dr. Smalldon explained that certain developmental factors in Mammone\u2019s childhood likely played a role in shaping his personality. People interviewed by Dr. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>Smalldon described Mammone as inward, reclusive, and passive in his relationships with others. But according to Dr. Smalldon, Mammone experienced tremendous social turmoil during the two years preceding the murders.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-6\">{\u00b6 228} Marcia was Mammone\u2019s first serious girlfriend. They began dating when Mammone was age 23 and married when he was age 25. Mammone described Marcia in highly idealized terms, such as calling her a moral woman of God. He believed that they were soul mates and that God had blessed their union.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-7\">{\u00b6 229} A few years into the marriage, Marcia mentioned a scenario in which she could imagine leaving the marriage, and it hit Mammone hard. When he later learned that Marcia wanted to see a marriage counselor, his insecurity came to the surface. Marcia tried to leave Mammone in August 2007, and from then on, Mammone was beside himself and his anxiety increased. He blew up at a Cleveland Browns game in late 2007 and continued to be in emotional tumult during 2008. Mammone was devastated when Marcia left him. He responded with panic.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-8\">{\u00b6 230} Mammone was always polite and respectful during meetings with Dr. Smalldon. He was \u201calmost disarmingly casual and matter of fact,\u201d even when describing his crimes. In fact, Mammone was eager to discuss the circumstances of his crimes and arrest. He repeatedly expressed remorse about Margaret\u2019s death, but he never questioned his decision to take Macy\u2019s and James\u2019s lives. He justified killing the children by saying that he was acting as \u201can instrument of moral righteousness\u201d and that \u201cit was absolutely the correct thing to do to restore them to their purity.\u201d Mammone told Dr. Smalldon that it would have been unacceptable for them to be brought up in a broken home. According to Dr. Smalldon, Mammone still to this day considers himself to be a devoted father. Dr. Smalldon explained that when Mammone left the voice mail for his friend Richard Hull, he was speaking from the bottom, in a moment of anger and utter despair. Dr. Smalldon opined that he does not think that Mammone was literally stating his motivation for the murders in that voice mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-9\">{\u00b6 231} Dr. Smalldon performed cognitive and neuropsychological testing on Mammone. Mammone has a full-scale IQ of 117, indicating above-average intelligence. He always gave his best effort on tests and never tried to convince Dr. Smalldon that he was mentally ill. Dr. Smalldon found no evidence of physical brain impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b623-10\">{\u00b6 232} Mammone\u2019s profile on the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (commonly called the MMPI-2) indicated a number of characteristics that are rarely seen in people who are not psychotic. For example, Mammone\u2019s thinking was confused and very disordered, he experienced profound personal alienation, he was preoccupied with odd or occult ideas, he spent a great deal of time engaged in fantasies, his thinking was rigid and unwavering, he was preoccupied <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>with persecutory thoughts, and he viewed the world as highly threatening. Nevertheless, Dr. Smalldon stated that he does not believe that Mammone is psychotic.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">{\u00b6 233} Dr. Smalldon diagnosed Mammone with an unspecified personality disorder, with schizotypal, borderline, and narcissistic features. He explained that this is a severe personality disorder. \u201cSchizotypal\u201d refers to an inner personality that is typically perceived by others as highly idiosyncratic and is often associated with deficits in empathy and with feelings of alienation. \u201cBorderline\u201d means that Mammone tends to see things in black-and-white terms and has an unstable sense of self. He is likely to be preoccupied with abandonment and prone to overreact emotionally. Finally, \u201cnarcissistic\u201d means that Mammone acts with a high degree of self-absorption. Dr. Smalldon also identified passive-aggressive and obsessive-compulsive personality traits and concluded that Mammone suffers from generalized anxiety disorder. In addition, Mammone had engaged in episodic alcohol abuse in the past. Dr. Smalldon indicated that these diagnoses are consistent with diagnoses by prior treating mental-health professionals.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">{\u00b6 234} On cross-examination, Dr. Smalldon conceded that Mammone does not have brain damage and that he is not insane, bipolar, delusional, schizophrenic, or an alcoholic. He then confirmed that Mammone had \u201cthought about [murder] almost constantly for about a year,\u201d and he indicated that jealousy undoubtedly played a role in motivating Mammone to commit the killings.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-7\">C. Weighing of Aggravating Circumstances and Mitigating Factors</p>\n<p id=\"b624-8\">{\u00b6 235} This court is required to independently determine whether the aggravating circumstances the offender was found guilty of committing outweigh the mitigating factors in the case. R.C. 2929.05(A). Mammone now urges us to assign weight to the following mitigating factors: (1) his mental state at the time of the murders (R.C. 2929.04(B)(3)), (2) his history and background, (3) his lack of significant criminal history (R.C. 2929.04(B)(5)), and (4) his cooperation with the police investigation and remorse for Margaret\u2019s murder (R.C. 2929.04(B)(7)).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-9\">{\u00b6 236} Mammone\u2019s mental state is not entitled to any weight under R.C. 2929.04(B)(3). Although Dr. Smalldon testified that Mammone was under extreme emotional distress and was suffering from a severe mental disorder at the time of the murders, there is no evidence that Mammone \u201clacked substantial capacity to appreciate the criminality of [his] conduct or to conform [his] conduct to the requirements of the law\u201d at that time. R.C. 2929.04(B)(3). Dr. Smalldon acknowledged as much, and Mammone\u2019s own actions \u2014 taking steps to avoid detection such as driving at the speed limit on infrequently patrolled roads\u2014 confirmed that he knew that his conduct was criminal. Mammone\u2019s mental problems therefore do not qualify as a mitigating factor under R.C. 2929.04(B)(3). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>All of this evidence is, however, relevant under R.C. 2929.04(B)(7). <em>See, e.g., State v. Treesh, </em>90 Ohio St.3d 460, 492, 739 N.E.2d 749 (2001) (considering evidence of mental problems under R.C. 2929.04(B)(7) when evidence did not satisfy the criteria of R.C. 2929.04(B)(3)); <em>State v. Fears, </em>86 Ohio St.3d at 349, 715 N.E.2d 136.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">{\u00b6 237} Mammone\u2019s history and background are entitled to some weight in mitigation. As explained above, Mammone as a child had a strained relationship with his father. There is evidence that James Jr. emotionally abused Mammone and physically abused Mammone and his mother. But Mammone also enjoyed the love and support of his mother and his grandparents (particularly his paternal grandfather) throughout his childhood. We therefore assign slight mitigating weight to the difficult circumstances of Mammone\u2019s childhood. <em>See, e.g., State v. Perez, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 122, 2009-Ohio-6179, 920 N.E.2d 104, \u00b6244 (difficult childhood as mitigating factor); <em>State v. Scott, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 31, 2004-Ohio-10, 800 N.E.2d 1133, \u00b6 103,108 (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-7\">{\u00b6 238} Mammone\u2019s lack of a significant criminal record is entitled to minimal weight. Mammone has only one prior criminal conviction, for a fourth-degree misdemeanor. But that conviction was for domestic violence against Marcia, and given that revenge against her was a motivating factor in these purposeful killings, we assign little mitigating weight to Mammone\u2019s lack of criminal history. <em>See State v. Mundt, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 22, 2007-Ohio-4836, 873 N.E.2d 828, at \u00b6 207-208 (assigning little weight to criminal-history factor when defendant had a prior misdemeanor conviction for domestic violence against a member of his household).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-8\">{\u00b6 239} Finally, under the catchall mitigation provision, we assign weight to a variety of factors. First, we give moderate weight to Dr. Smalldon\u2019s extensive testimony about Mammone\u2019s severe personality disorder and his mental state. <em>See State v. Hoffner, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 358, 2004-Ohio-3430, 811 N.E.2d 48, \u00b6 76,118 (assigning moderate weight to defendant\u2019s personality disorders). Second, we give some weight to Mammone\u2019s strong work history and his success as a student. <em>See State v. Hand, </em>107 Ohio St.3d 378, 2006-Ohio-18, 840 N.E.2d 151, \u00b6 281 (work history as mitigating factor). Finally, since committing these crimes, Mammone has expressed remorse for Margaret\u2019s murder (though not for the murders of Macy and James), cooperated with the police investigation, and adjusted well to incarceration. <em>See State v. Smith, </em>80 Ohio St.3d 89, 121, 684 N.E.2d 668 (1997) (remorse, cooperation, and adjustment to incarceration afforded marginal weight). We assign modest weight to each of these factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">{\u00b6 240} We conclude that the two aggravating circumstances for each of the three murder counts outweigh the mitigating factors. With respect to Margaret\u2019s murder, the course-of-conduct and felony-murder specifications strongly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>outweigh the mitigating factors. <em>See State v. Short, </em>129 Ohio St.3d 360, 2011-Ohio-3641, 952 N.E.2d 1121, at \u00b6 163 (rejecting defendant\u2019s argument that multiple-murder specification should be afforded \u201ccomparatively light weight\u201d in case in which the state had proved two aggravating circumstances \u2014 course of conduct and felony murder predicated on aggravated burglary). The two specifications that apply to the murders of Macy and James \u2014 course of conduct and child murder \u2014 overwhelm the mitigating factors. \u201cIn particular, the R.C. 2929.04(A)(9) child-murder specification is entitled to great weight because it involved the murder of a young and vulnerable victim.\u201d <em>State v. Powell, </em>132 Ohio St.3d 233, 2012-Ohio-2577, 971 N.E.2d 865, \u00b6 282. As a result, we conclude that for each of the three murders, the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">D. Proportionality</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">{\u00b6 241} Finally, we conclude that the death penalty is appropriate and proportionate here when compared to death sentences approved in similar cases. We have previously upheld death sentences for a course of conduct under R.C. 2929.04(A)(5). <em>See, e.g., State v. Trimble, </em>122 Ohio St.3d 297, 2009-Ohio-2961, 911 N.E.2d 242, at \u00b6 329; <em>Hand, </em>107 Ohio St.3d 378, 2006-Ohio-18, 840 N.E.2d 151, at \u00b6 284; <em>State v. Cunningham, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 197, 2004-Ohio-7007, 824 N.E.2d 504, at \u00b6 140. We have also upheld the death penalty for other child murders under R.C. 2929.04(A)(9). See <em>Powell </em>at \u00b6 284; <em>State v. Hunter, </em>131 Ohio St.3d 67, 2011-Ohio-6524, 960 N.E.2d 955, \u00b6 206; <em>State v. Fitzpatrick, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 321, 2004-Ohio-3167, 810 N.E.2d 927, \u00b6 119. Finally, we have upheld the death penalty for aggravated murder during an aggravated burglary under R.C. 2929.04(A)(7). <em>See, e.g., State v. Goff, </em>82 Ohio St.3d 123, 143-144, 694 N.E.2d 916 (1998); <em>State v. Bonnell, </em>61 Ohio St.3d 179, 187, 573 N.E.2d 1082 (1991); <em>State v. Franklin, </em>62 Ohio St.3d 118, 129-130, 580 N.E.2d 1 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b626-8\">{\u00b6 242} We affirm all judgments of conviction and the sentences of death entered against James Mammone III.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">Judgments affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b626-10\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, O\u2019Donnell, Kennedy, and French, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b626-11\">O\u2019Neill, J., concurs in part and dissents in part.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"Aj-\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>John D.

Welch, Assistant Public Defenders; and Angela Miller, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b587-8\">. Mammone\u2019s generalized claims about other adverse pretrial publicity and social media are insufficient to trigger a presumption of prejudice. His assertions about extensive media coverage would apply to nearly every homicide case. And he points to no evidence that the social media comments cited \u201care representative of the hundreds of thousands of individuals who [were] eligible to serve as jurors\u201d in his trial. <em>United States v. Warren, </em>989 F.Supp.2d at 501.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b587-9\">. Mammone\u2019s confession letter published in the <em>Repository </em>was not admitted into evidence at trial. However, the jury during the trial phase did hear a recording of his confession made to police officers on the day of his arrest. The jury also heard a five-hour unsworn statement Mammone made during the mitigation phase of his trial, in which he confessed in great detail.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b590-9\">. Mammone also argues, in a single sentence without citation, that \u201cit was error for the trial court to deny defense counsel\u2019s motion for additional peremptory challenges.\u201d We summarily reject this argument based on our review of the record. <em>See State v. Stallings, </em>89 Ohio St.3d 280, 288-289, 731 N.E.2d 159 (2000) (summarily rejecting argument that trial court erred by denying motion for 12 peremptory challenges); <em>State v. Greer, </em>39 Ohio St.3d 236, 530 N.E.2d 382 (1988), paragraph two of the syllabus (numerical limit on peremptory challenges is reasonable regulation of right to challenge prospective jurors during voir dire).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b594-9\">. Mammone does not challenge any photographs of Margaret Eakin. Even if he had, however, the admission of those photos was proper because their probative value outweighed the danger of unfair prejudice and the photos were not repetitive or cumulative. <em>See State v. Maurer, </em>15 Ohio St.3d 239, 473 N.E.2d 768, at paragraph seven of the syllabus.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b597-11\">. Even if one or more of these photos had been introduced in error, any such error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 23-24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967); <em>State v. Lundgren, </em>73 Ohio St.3d 474, 486, 653 N.E.2d 304 (1995). The evidence that Mammone murdered Macy and James was overwhelming: Mammone confessed these crimes to law enforcement in detail, and the jury heard his recorded confession at trial. Further, there is no evidence that these photos improperly affected the jury during the penalty phase. <em>Compare Thompson, </em>33 Ohio St.3d at 14-15, 514 N.E.2d 407 (admission of gruesome photos was harmless error at trial phase, but was not harmless when prosecutor committed misconduct during penalty phase by overzealously appealing to jurors\u2019 emotions in urging them to remember those photos when weighing appropriateness of death sentence).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b627-3\">O\u2019Neill, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AeZ\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">{\u00b6 243} Once again, a case has come before us that challenges my resolve to stay the course regarding the unconstitutionality of the death penalty in Ohio. It is incomprehensible how someone could murder his own children while they are helplessly strapped into their car seats. Five-year-old Macy and three-year-old James were stabbed in their throats by their father for absolutely no reason other than to make their mother suffer.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">{\u00b6 244} This case comes on the heels of <em>State v. Kirkland, </em>\u2014 Ohio St.3d-, 2014-Ohio-1966, \u2014 N.E.3d-, and <em>State v. Wogenstahl, </em>134 Ohio St.3d 1437, 2013-Ohio-164, 981 N.E.2d 900, two other capital cases involving atrocious monsters who took the lives of innocent children in gruesome acts of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">{\u00b6 245} There is no doubt that these three murderers should be dealt with in the strongest manner permitted under the Constitution. I agree with the majority in this ease that Mammone\u2019s convictions must stand. The state proved its case, and it has demonstrated that he is guilty of multiple murders, beyond a reasonable doubt. However, as evil as Mammone is, I still must conclude that life in prison without the possibility of ever being released is the appropriate sentence, for the reasons I offered in my dissent in <em>Wogenstahl. See id. </em>at \u00b6 1-9 (O\u2019Neill, J., dissenting). The death penalty is both cruel and unusual and I refuse to ratify the taking of any human life in the name of retribution, deterrence, or punishment. We as a society live by our Constitutions and by a moral code that clearly is not subscribed to by this defendant. On a moral level, I simply cannot countenance the concept of lowering 11 million Ohioans to Mr. Mammone\u2019s level of depravity.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">{\u00b6 246} Accordingly, I concur in affirming the convictions and dissent on the imposition of the death penalty.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
