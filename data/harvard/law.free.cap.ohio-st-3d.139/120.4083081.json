The court of appeals granted Judge McDonnell\u2019s motion to dismiss both actions. The brothers filed separate, timely appeals with this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">{\u00b6 2} Because the facts surrounding the brothers\u2019 convictions and the forfeiture of their property are nearly identical, we adopt the facts set forth in our opinion in Todd West\u2019s case, <em>State ex rel. West v. McDonnell, </em>139 Ohio St.3d 115, 2014-Ohio-1562, 9 N.E.3d 1025, as the facts in this case. For the same reasons that we rejected Todd West\u2019s two propositions of law, which are identical to Timothy West\u2019s first two propositions of law, we also reject Timothy West\u2019s first two propositions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">{\u00b6 3} In his third proposition of law, West objects to the manner in which court costs have been assessed against him. Specifically, West objects to the alleged failure of the clerk of courts to provide him with a copy of an itemized bill. Assuming that this is a proper matter to raise in this appeal, we nevertheless reject West\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">{\u00b6 4} The clerk of the court of common pleas is required to prepare an itemized bill of costs upon the rendition of any judgment. R.C. 2303.28. The clerk cannot issue an execution for costs unless an itemized statement has been rendered. Id.; <em>see also </em>R.C. 2335.19(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">{\u00b6 5} Pursuant to R.C. 2303.03(A), the clerk of the court of common pleas also serves as clerk of courts for the court of \u00e1ppeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-10\">{\u00b6 6} According to West, the cost bill sent by the clerk of courts was not itemized. However, West failed to submit a copy of the cost bill for the court\u2019s review. The appellate court record does contain a statement of costs, but it is unclear if this is the same document of which West complains.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-11\">{\u00b6 7} Moreover, West has not alleged that the clerk of courts has issued a certificate of judgment against him for those costs or undertaken any collection attempts. Therefore, his objection is premature at best.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-12\">{\u00b6 8} Based on the foregoing, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-13\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b229-14\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Pfeifer, O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, Kennedy, French, and O\u2019Neill, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<attorneys id=\"AZb\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>Timothy West, pro se.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A7\">Timothy J.
