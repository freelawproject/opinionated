The trial court accepted those recommendations and sentenced Neyland accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-11\">I. Trial Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b461-12\">A. <em>State\u2019s case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b461-13\">{\u00b6 2} Evidence introduced at trial showed that Neyland began working as a truck driver for Liberty Transportation Company in Perrysburg, Ohio, in July 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-14\">{\u00b6 3} Beginning in March 2007, Neyland was cited several times for falsifying his driver\u2019s logs and for committing other driving violations. On July 24, 2007, Liberty notified Neyland in writing of these infractions and informed him that any further violations for completing a false document would result in his termination from the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-15\">{\u00b6 4} Doug Smith was the branch manager for Liberty Transportation in Perrysburg. During the spring of 2007, Smith noticed a change in Neyland\u2019s attitude and performance. Smith was receiving complaints from Liberty\u2019s customers about Neyland, and some of them did not want Neyland to return to their businesses. Neyland and Smith had a meeting about one of the complaints. The meeting resulted in a bizarre ending with Neyland seated in a lawn chair outside Smith\u2019s office, repeatedly phoning him, while Smith remained in his office with the doors locked.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-16\">{\u00b6 5} During late July or early August 2007, Anthony Arent, the shipping manager at nearby Great Lakes Windows, overheard Neyland on the phone with Smith. Arent testified that Neyland was \u201cvery uncooperative\u201d during the conversation and that he resorted to profanity, calling Smith \u201ca bitch.\u201d William Lynch Jr., a truck driver for Liberty, talked to Neyland about a week before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>murders. Neyland, who was upset with Smith, warned, \u201cIf they mess with me, I\u2019ll just shoot them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">{\u00b6 6} On August 1, 2007, Neyland was involved in a vehicle accident and was determined to be at fault. Following this incident, officials at Liberty decided to terminate Neyland\u2019s employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">{\u00b6 7} Smith scheduled a meeting with Neyland at Smith\u2019s office at 8:00 a.m. on August 8, 2007, to terminate Neyland\u2019s employment. Thomas Lazar, the safety director for Liberty, planned to attend this meeting because Smith did not want to be alone with Neyland when he terminated him. Lazar also planned to remove the Department of Transportation (\u201cDOT\u201d) sticker that was attached to the door of Neyland\u2019s tractor-trailer.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">{\u00b6 8} On August 8, Neyland delayed the meeting three times before he finally agreed to meet with Smith and Lazar at 3:00 p.m. During one conversation to reschedule the meeting, Neyland told Smith that if Smith was going to have somebody at the meeting, then he was going to bring somebody, too.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">{\u00b6 9} At approximately 3:00 p.m., Neyland arrived outside Liberty\u2019s warehouse in his tractor. Neyland was wearing a dark Hawaiian shirt. It is unclear whether Neyland met with either Lazar or Smith when he first arrived. In any event, Neyland shot Lazar four times in the back and once in the arm in the yard outside the building. Neyland then entered Liberty\u2019s warehouse with a gun in his hand and walked up the stairway to Smith\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-8\">{\u00b6 10} Smith called 9-1-1 and reported that he heard shots being fired. He told the 9-1-1 operator that he needed to get downstairs to see what was going on. On the recording of the call, two gunshots can be heard and a voice says, \u201ccrawl bitch.\u201d There is then the sound of a struggle, and Smith repeatedly calls for help. A final shot was then fired. Neyland had killed Smith in his office with a single gunshot to the head.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">{\u00b6 11} Afterwards, Neyland left the warehouse with the gun in his hand. He walked to his tractor and drove away.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-10\">{\u00b6 12} Police officers arriving at the scene found Lazar lying on the lawn in front of Liberty\u2019s warehouse. He died at the scene shortly thereafter. Officers also went upstairs and found Smith\u2019s dead body lying on the floor near his desk. A description of Neyland\u2019s tractor, along with a partial license-plate number, was broadcast to law-enforcement agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-11\">{\u00b6 13} Investigators collected shell casings outside the warehouse and around Smith\u2019s office. They found one bullet hole that went through Smith\u2019s chair and into the wall and another bullet hole in the wall behind the chair. Investigators also found paperwork about Neyland\u2019s performance, including a driver\u2019s vehicle-inspection report, in the middle of the desk.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>{\u00b6 14} After the shooting, Neyland drove to the Silver Blue Motel in Monroe County, Michigan, where he was staying. During the late afternoon of August 8, 2007, police officers spotted Neyland\u2019s tractor parked outside the motel. Officers watched the tractor until the Monroe County Special Weapons and Tactics (\u201cSWAT\u201d) team arrived.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">{\u00b6 15} Around 6:00 p.m., Neyland came out of his motel room, got into the tractor, and drove the short distance to the motel office. The SWAT team then approached the vehicle and arrested Neyland. As he was being placed on the ground, Neyland said, \u201cI was going to turn myself in.\u201d Neyland also said, \u201cI want the letter. There\u2019s a letter in my truck. It\u2019s to my brother. It\u2019s my last will.\u201d When asked if he had any weapons before being handcuffed, Neyland said, \u201cNo, the gun is in the truck by the door.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">{\u00b6 16} Neyland was placed in a police cruiser following his arrest. Sgt. Keith Williamson of the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation (\u201cBCI &amp; I\u201d) Crime Scene Unit, obtained a gunshot-residue sample from Neyland\u2019s hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">{\u00b6 17} After obtaining a search warrant, the police seized evidence from Neyland\u2019s tractor. A Ruger 9 mm handgun and magazine inside a holster, another weapon magazine, and a dark Hawaiian shirt were found between the driver\u2019s and the passenger\u2019s seats. Sgt. Williamson also obtained a gunshot-residue sample from the steering wheel.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">{\u00b6 18} During the search of the tractor, the police collected an envelope addressed to Phyllis Gregory with Neyland\u2019s return address. Inside the envelope were three default-payment notices that had been sent to Neyland for four storage units. On each of the notices, Neyland had handwritten some variation of the following statement: \u201cThis may be my last will and testament. You may have these items. I will no longer be able to pay; these are paid til 8/1/07.\u201d Two of the statements were signed by Neyland. On the reverse side of one notice, Neyland wrote that additional items were located at the Silver Blue Motel. Beneath this last statement, Neyland wrote an address next to his brother\u2019s name.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-10\">{\u00b6 19} Dr. Cynthia Beisser, M.D., deputy coroner for Lucas County, conducted the autopsies on Smith and Lazar. Dr. Beisser testified that Smith died from one gunshot wound to the head. The gunshot entered Smith\u2019s right cheek and exited just above his left ear.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-11\">{\u00b6 20} Dr. Beisser testified that Lazar was shot four times in the back and once in the right arm. Three of the shots in the back were in close proximity and displayed a triangular pattern. Gunpowder stippling around one of the gunshot wounds in the back indicated \u201can intermediate range of fire.\u201d Dr. Beisser concluded that Lazar\u2019s death resulted from multiple gunshot wounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>{\u00b6 21} After obtaining a search warrant, the police searched Neyland\u2019s storage units. In one of the units, the police found two spotting scopes set up in the middle of the unit with pieces of paper underneath. The top piece of paper stated, \u201cIf your big dumb retard ass wasn\u2019t in here!!! You wouldn\u2019t be reading this would you?\u201d A paper underneath that one stated, \u201cOOOO, I\u2019m so scared. Three Round Shot Group.\u201d On the same paper, three pennies were arranged in a triangular pattern with circles drawn around them. Below the pennies, there was the statement, \u201cYou think I\u2019m playing[.] You\u2019re gonna come up missing!!!\u201d Numerous firearms and ammunition were also found in the storage unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">{\u00b6 22} Daniel Davison, a forensic scientist at BCI &amp; I, performed a gunshot-residue analysis on samples from Neyland\u2019s hands and from the steering wheel of the tractor. Davison testified that test results were \u201chighly indicative of gunshot residue\u201d on one of the samples from Neyland\u2019s hands and on a sample from the steering wheel.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">{\u00b6 23} Todd Wharton, a forensic scientist at BCI &amp; I, compared Neyland\u2019s fingerprints with a fingerprint lifted from a weapons magazine found in Neyland\u2019s tractor. Wharton testified that his comparison identified the print of Neyland\u2019s left little finger on the magazine.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">{\u00b6 24} Wharton also examined the Ruger 9 mm semiautomatic pistol found in Neyland\u2019s tractor. Testing established that the empty cartridge cases collected at the murder scene were fired from this firearm. Testing also confirmed that bullets recovered from the scene and from the Lazar autopsy had been fired by this firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">B. <em>Defense case</em></p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">{\u00b6 25} The defense presented no witnesses during the trial phase. The defense did present four sales receipts showing that two rifles, a shotgun, and a pistol found in Neyland\u2019s storage unit had been purchased on November 3, 2006. Defense counsel offered this evidence to show that these weapons were purchased almost ten months before the homicides.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">II. Case History</p>\n<p id=\"b464-10\">{\u00b6 26} Neyland was indicted on two counts of aggravated murder pursuant to R.C. 2903.01(A). Count One charged Neyland with the aggravated murder of Lazar with prior calculation and design. Count Two charged Neyland with the aggravated murder of Smith with prior calculation and design.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-11\">{\u00b6 27} Counts One and Two included death-penalty specifications for purposeful killings as part of a course of conduct, R.C. 2929.04(A)(5). Count Two included a death-penalty specification for murder to escape accounting for a crime, R.C. 2929.04(A)(3). Both counts also included gun specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>{\u00b6 28} Neyland pleaded not guilty to all charges. The jury found Neyland guilty of all charges and specifications, except he was found not guilty of the specification for murder to escape accounting for a crime. Neyland was sentenced to death on the two counts of aggravated murder. He was also sentenced to six years in prison for the two gun specifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">III. Issues on Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">{\u00b6 29} The principal issues for review include Neyland\u2019s competency to stand trial, the trial court\u2019s order that Neyland wear leg restraints in the courtroom, the introduction of weapons and ammunition not used in the murders, the introduction of Dr. Smith\u2019s former testimony during the penalty phase, and the adequacy of the trial court\u2019s sentencing opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">{\u00b6 30} In this appeal, Neyland seeks reversal of his convictions and sentence in 19 propositions of law. We will address the issues in the approximate order that they arose during the trial proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">A. <em>Pretrial and trial-phase issues</em></p>\n<p id=\"b465-10\">1. <em>Competency to stand trial </em>(Proposition of law I)</p>\n<p id=\"b465-11\">{\u00b6 31} Neyland argues that the trial court abused its discretion in finding that he was competent to stand trial, because this ruling is not supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-12\">{\u00b6 32} The test for determining whether a defendant is competent to stand trial is \u201c \u2018 \u201cwhether [the defendant] has sufficient present ability to consult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding \u2014 and whether he has a rational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Berry, </em>72 Ohio St.3d 354, 359, 650 N.E.2d 433 (1995), quoting <em>Dusky v. United States, </em>362 U.S. 402, 80 S.Ct. 788, 4 L.Ed.2d 824 (1960), quoting the argument of then Solicitor General J. Lee Rankin. Moreover, a defendant is presumed to be competent to stand trial, and the burden is on the defendant to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that he is not competent. <em>State v. Jordan, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 216, 2004-Ohio-783, 804 N.E.2d 1, \u00b6 28; R.C. 2945.37(G).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-13\">{\u00b6 33} A trial court\u2019s finding that a defendant is competent to stand trial will not be disturbed when there is some reliable and credible evidence supporting that finding. <em>State v. Were, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 448, 2008-Ohio-2762, 890 N.E.2d 263, \u00b6 46; <em>State v. Vrabel, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 184, 2003-Ohio-3193, 790 N.E.2d 303, \u00b6 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-14\">a. The competency proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b465-15\">{\u00b6 34} Defense counsel submitted a pretrial motion requesting that Neyland be examined to determine whether he was competent to stand trial. Dr. Thomas G. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>Sherman, a psychiatrist at the Court Diagnostic and Treatment Center, met with Neyland and concluded that he was not competent to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">{\u00b6 35} The trial court granted the state\u2019s request for a second evaluation of Neyland\u2019s competency to be conducted on an in-patient basis at Twin Valley Behavioral Healthcare. Dr. Delaney Smith, a psychiatrist at Twin Valley, and Dr. Kristen E. Haskins, a clinical psychologist at Twin Valley, evaluated Neyland. They found that Neyland was competent to stand trial. The trial court then granted a defense request for a third evaluation. Dr. Barbra A. Bergman, a clinical/forensic psychologist, conducted this evaluation and concluded that Neyland was competent.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">{\u00b6 36} Thereafter, the trial court conducted a competency hearing. Dr. Sherman testified that he spent a little over an hour talking with Neyland and determined that he had a mental illness, most likely schizophrenia. Dr. Sherman mentioned that Neyland had been evaluated in the late 1990s, and it was determined that he had a mental illness then. Dr. Sherman provided examples of Neyland\u2019s paranoid thinking. Neyland believed that people were placing prophylactics in his laundry and that people were entering his apartment and listening to his answering machine.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">{\u00b6 37} Dr. Sherman stated that as a result of his mental illness, Neyland was \u201cnot able to understand the nature or the gravity of the charges against him, but more importantly it impacted upon his ability to cooperate with his own defense.\u201d Dr. Sherman concluded that Neyland was not competent to stand trial. He stated, \u201cThis was not even a close call.\u201d During cross-examination, Dr. Sherman acknowledged that he did not speak with Neyland\u2019s attorneys, did not administer any tests, and did not review the reports completed by the other psychologists who had examined Neyland.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-8\">{\u00b6 38} Dr. Smith testified that Neyland was under her care during his 30-day in-patient stay at Twin Valley. Dr. Smith was responsible for doing \u201cintake on him, a psychiatric assessment, and prescribing any medications.\u201d Dr. Smith detected no signs of mental illness, but determined that Neyland had a paranoid personality disorder. She stated that Neyland discussed his plans to work with his attorneys and mentioned that if things did not work out at trial he could file an appeal. Dr. Smith also testified that \u201che was able to be cooperative when he chose to be so; and that when he chose not to be cooperative it was just that, it was a choice that he was making and not the product of some mental illness, such as being grossly delusional * * * or hearing voices telling him not to cooperate.\u201d Dr. Smith concluded, \u201cIt is my opinion within a reasonable medical certainty that he is both able to understand the nature and objectives of the proceedings as well as to assist counsel in his defense should he choose to do so.\u201d Yet Dr. Smith did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>not complete a written report and acknowledged that it was not her purpose to conduct a competency evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">{\u00b6 39} Dr. Haskins also evaluated Neyland during his stay at Twin Valley. She administered a test called the MacArthur Competence Assessment Tool-Criminal Adjudication (\u201cMacCAT-CA\u201d) to help determine Neyland\u2019s competency. Neyland had a low score of 4 out of a possible 16 on the reasoning section, suggesting serious difficulty in distinguishing relevant from irrelevant information and difficulty in reasoning through the options of pleading guilty or not guilty. Dr. Haskins attributed this low score to Neyland\u2019s refusal to cooperate with the assessment procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">{\u00b6 40} But Dr. Haskins\u2019s clinical evaluation showed that Neyland was aware of the charges against him, knew the possible pleas and the potential sentences, and understood the different roles of the parties. Neyland also stated that he would allow his attorneys to defend him. Dr. Haskins testified that Neyland is \u201cat least of average intelligence\u201d and that he does not have a serious mental illness. She concluded that Neyland is \u201ccapable of understanding the nature and objective of the proceedings against him and of assisting in his own defense.\u201d Yet Dr. Haskins said, \u201c[I]t\u2019s going to be very difficult for his attorneys to represent him. He is not stupid. * * * He has certain thoughts about how he wants things to go.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">{\u00b6 41} Dr. Bergman evaluated Neyland during a one-hour interview at the Wood County Jail. She testified that Neyland did not want her to conduct this evaluation, because a competency evaluation had already found that he was competent. She stated that Neyland was \u201cvery controlling\u201d and would not allow her to ask questions about pertinent topics. Dr. Bergman believed that Neyland had a personality disorder with predominant features that are paranoid, narcissistic, schizoid, and obsessive-compulsive. Dr. Bergman concluded that Neyland understood the nature and significance of the charges and the objectives of the court proceedings and that he was capable of assisting his counsel and meaningfully participating in the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">{\u00b6 42} The trial court found Neyland competent to stand trial. The trial court stated that Dr. Smith and Dr. Haskins were more persuasive than Dr. Sherman, because the doctors at Twin Valley had the opportunity to observe Neyland\u2019s behavior for approximately 30 days. The trial court discounted Neyland\u2019s low score on the reasoning section of the MacCAT-CA because all the doctors who evaluated Neyland indicated that he was very guarded and that Neyland exercised his right against self-incrimination, which made it difficult to administer the test.</p>\n<p id=\"Adg\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>b. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">{\u00b6 43} Neyland argues that the trial court abused its discretion in finding that he was competent to stand trial. He asserts that Dr. Sherman\u2019s report, along with his experience, deserved as much weight, if not more, than the other expert opinions. Neyland also attacks the findings of the three experts who found him to be competent and argues that the trial court erred in relying on their testimony in finding him competent.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">{\u00b6 44} First, Neyland argues that Dr. Haskins\u2019s opinion that he was competent was not supported by her own underlying findings about Neyland, including (1) his inability to disclose personal information, (2) his rigid neurotic adjustment, (3) his clinically significant impairment and serious difficulty in distinguishing relevant from less relevant factual information and in reasoning through legal options of pleading guilty or not guilty, and (4) the likelihood that he would be a very difficult defendant with whom to reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">{\u00b6 45} Neyland\u2019s claims take Dr. Haskins\u2019s statements out of context. Dr. Haskins acknowledged that the validity of Neyland\u2019s test results on the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 (\u201cMMPI-2\u201d) might have been compromised by his unwillingness or inability to disclose personal information. Dr. Haskins also discussed the possibility that Neyland\u2019s pattern of uncooperativeness may be due to a \u201crigid neurotic adjustment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">{\u00b6 46} Dr. Haskins did report that Neyland scored low on the reasoning section of the MacCAT-CA. But Dr. Haskins attributed Neyland\u2019s low score to his refusal to cooperate with the assessment procedures. Dr. Haskins\u2019s comment that Neyland will be a \u201cvery difficult defendant with whom to reason\u201d came after her discussion about Neyland\u2019s refusal to cooperate and refusal to answer certain questions on the MacCAT-CA. Dr. Haskins\u2019s observations do not conflict with her finding that Neyland is competent to stand trial. As noted in <em>Berry, </em>72 Ohio St.3d at 360-361, 650 N.E.2d 433, a defendant\u2019s failure to cooperate with counsel does not constitute sufficient indicia of incompetence to raise doubt about a defendant\u2019s competence to stand trial. Thus, Dr. Haskins\u2019s findings do not undermine her competency findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">{\u00b6 47} Second, Neyland argues that Dr. Bergman\u2019s opinion that he was competent to stand trial is undermined by her observations of Neyland\u2019s (1) poor judgment, (2) inflexible, rigid views, (3) limited insight, (4) severe personality disorder, and (5) failure to assist his counsel to prepare for his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">{\u00b6 48} Dr. Bergman discussed Neyland\u2019s mental status in her written evaluation. Neyland\u2019s poor judgment, inflexible, rigid views, and limited insight into his own behavior were some of the factors that led to Dr. Bergman\u2019s conclusion that Neyland had a severe personality disorder. These findings do not undermine Dr. Bergman\u2019s conclusion that Neyland was competent to stand trial. Indeed, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>\u201c[i]neompetency must not be equated with mere mental or emotional instability or even with outright insanity. A defendant may be emotionally disturbed or even psychotic and still be capable of understanding the charges against him and of assisting his counsel.\u201d <em>State v. Bock, </em>28 Ohio St.3d 108, 110, 502 N.E.2d 1016 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">{\u00b6 49} Dr. Bergman\u2019s evaluation included her discussion with J. Scott Hicks, Neyland\u2019s defense counsel. Hicks reported that Neyland is \u201cno help at all in preparing the case for [the] defense.\u201d Dr. Bergman stated that Neyland had his own ideas about his defense and expressed his unhappiness with counsel\u2019s direction in managing his case. Yet Neyland clearly understood his legal rights and stated several times, \u201cI have a right to remain silent.\u201d Neyland\u2019s lack of cooperation with defense counsel at various times did not establish that he was not competent to stand trial. <em>See Vrabel, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 184, 2003-Ohio-3193, 790 N.E.2d 303, at \u00b6 30. Thus, Dr. Bergman\u2019s comments about Neyland\u2019s lack of cooperation with counsel did not invalidate her findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">{\u00b6 50} Neyland also argues that Dr. Bergman\u2019s finding of competency was based on the wrong standard, i.e., she believed that he must be suffering from mental illness or mental retardation to be found incompetent. We also reject this claim. In finding Neyland competent, Dr. Bergman testified, \u201cIn my opinion he does understand the nature and significance of the charges. He does understand the nature and objectives of the Court proceedings. He is capable of assisting his attorney and he is capable of participating in a meaningful manner in the Court proceedings.\u201d Thus, Dr. Bergman used the correct standard in finding that Neyland was competent to stand trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-8\">{\u00b6 51} Finally, Neyland argues that the trial court\u2019s factual findings underlying its determination that he was competent to stand trial were clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">{\u00b6 52} First, Neyland argues that Dr. Smith\u2019s testimony could not form the basis for the trial court\u2019s findings, because Dr. Smith testified that it was not her job to perform a competency evaluation and she did not prepare a written report. Thus, Neyland argues that Dr. Smith\u2019s testimony did not meet the exacting standards of R.C. 2945.371. However, Neyland failed to object to Dr. Smith\u2019s opinion about his competency at the hearing and thus waived all but plain error. <em>See State v. Mink, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 350, 2004-Ohio-1580, 805 N.E.2d 1064, \u00b6 29. No plain error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-10\">{\u00b6 53} R.C. 2945.371 provides procedures for a trial court to follow in conducting competency evaluations. R.C. 2945.371(G)(1) and (2) provide that an examiner shall file a written report that includes the examiner\u2019s findings and the facts in reasonable detail on which the findings are based.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-11\">{\u00b6 54} R.C. 2945.37 provides procedures for conducting a competency hearing. R.C. 2945.37(E) states: \u201cThe prosecutor and defense counsel <em>may </em>submit evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>dence on the issue of the defendant\u2019s competence to stand trial. A written report of the evaluation of the defendant <em>may </em>be admitted into evidence at the hearing * * *.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Nothing in R.C. 2945.37 limits expert testimony that may be presented during such hearings.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">{\u00b6 55} Evid.R. 702(B) provides that \u201ca witness may testify as an expert\u201d by reason of his or her \u201cspecialized knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education.\u201d Dr. Smith was qualified to testify as an expert under Evid.R. 702 because of her specialized knowledge and experience as a psychiatrist. She testified that she had previously conducted between 30 and 40 competency evaluations. Neyland was under Dr. Smith\u2019s care during the 30 days that he was at Twin Valley, and she met with him throughout his stay. She also testified that she talked to other staff members who interacted with Neyland on a daily basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">{\u00b6 56} We conclude that a sufficient foundation was established for Dr. Smith to render an opinion about Neyland\u2019s competency to stand trial. Neyland\u2019s complaint that it was not Dr. Smith\u2019s job to conduct a competency evaluation goes to the weight to be given to her opinion and not her ability to render such an opinion. <em>See State v. Luoma, </em>2d Dist. Montgomery No. 10719, 1990 WL 197944, *10 (Dec. 7, 1990) (psychiatrist permitted to testify concerning defendant\u2019s sanity although his sole purpose for evaluating the defendant was to determine competency).</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">{\u00b6 57} Second, Neyland argues that the trial court should not have relied on Dr. Haskins\u2019s evaluation, because she spent only four hours with him. Neyland\u2019s claim overlooks the fact that Dr. Haskins reported that she received treatment-team updates during Neyland\u2019s in-patient stay, talked to defense counsel about him, reviewed treatment charts, reviewed Dr. Sherman\u2019s report, consulted with Dr. Smith, and reviewed other information involving his case. Moreover, Dr. Haskins was unable to meet with Neyland for a longer period, because he refused to meet with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">{\u00b6 58} Third, Neyland argues that the trial court erred in finding that because Dr. Smith and Dr. Haskins observed him for approximately 30 days, this gave them a better opportunity to observe his behavior than Dr. Sherman. Neyland emphasizes that Dr. Smith and Dr. Haskins testified that the length of an examination is not the crucial factor in conducting a competency evaluation. Neyland also points out that Dr. Bergman met with him for only an hour.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">{\u00b6 59} As with other witnesses, the trial judge heard all of the expert testimony, and it was his job to judge their credibility and weigh all the evidence in making his findings. Deference on these issues should be given to those \u201cwho see and hear what goes on in the courtroom.\u201d <em>State v. Cowans, </em>87 Ohio St.3d 68, 84, 717 N.E.2d 298 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>{\u00b6 60} The trial court\u2019s findings about the length of the evaluations were not unreasonable. Indeed, Dr. Smith compared her examination with Dr. Sherman\u2019s shorter examination. She noted, \u201cI had more time to observe and interact with Mr. Neyland and see him in various different settings and see his interactions with different people.\u201d Thus, we also reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">c. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">{\u00b6 61} We hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that Neyland was competent to stand trial. Three of the four witnesses who testified concluded that he was competent. The trial court also reasonably determined that greater weight should be given to testimony of a psychiatrist and a psychologist who examined Neyland during a 30-day observational period rather than a psychiatrist who spent only a little more than an hour with him. Thus, rehable and credible evidence supports the trial court\u2019s decision. We reject proposition I.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">2. <em>Request for self-representation </em>(Proposition of law XIV)</p>\n<p id=\"b471-9\">{\u00b6 62} Neyland argues that the trial court erred by failing to grant his request for self-representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-10\">a. Assertions and request for self-representation</p>\n<p id=\"b471-11\">{\u00b6 63} During a pretrial hearing on December 11, 2007, Neyland told the trial court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-12\">I might be able, I <em>might have to defend myself </em>because I am not getting cooperation that I need from the public defender\u2019s office.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-13\">And my credibility right now, I have 800 pages of prosecution here. I have no, I have nothing for discovery [from] the public defender\u2019s office. I have 800 pages from October from the prosecution\u2019s office, and I read the 800 pages. There is a credibility problem with every witness in here.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-14\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b471-15\">{\u00b6 64} In response, the trial court encouraged Neyland to work with his attorneys. The judge stated, \u201cI realize that everyone in your circumstance is nervous about their representation; but in view of the reports that I have received, I would strongly encourage you to not * * * consider that.\u201d The trial court\u2019s reference to \u201creports\u201d appears to have been Dr. Sherman\u2019s competency evaluation that the parties had been discussing during this hearing. Neyland responded, \u201cMy Sixth Amendments Rights have been violated.\u201d But Neyland said nothing more about representing himself.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>{\u00b6 65} During a pretrial hearing on February 12, 2008, the trial court expressed concern about the possibility that Neyland would request self-representation. The judge stated, \u201cI\u2019m hoping that he won\u2019t raise this * * *. But if at some point he expresses a clear and unequivocal request, then the Court is going to have to rule on it and address it.\u201d Adrian Cimerman, lead defense counsel, stated that Neyland had \u201cnever seriously, if at all, raised the desire to represent himself.\u201d J. Scott Hicks, assistant defense counsel, also stated, \u201cHe has never expressed to me any desire to represent himself.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">{\u00b6 66} During a pretrial hearing on August 25, 2008, the trial court asked defense counsel if Neyland was insisting that counsel withdraw and that he represent himself. Cimerman replied that Neyland was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">{\u00b6 67} On October 30, 2008, following the introduction of all the trial-phase evidence, the trial judge stated that the deputies had informed him that Neyland wanted to discuss representing himself. The trial court stated, \u201cI definitely am not going to let him represent himself pro se at this time because we\u2019re done basically other than closing arguments.\u201d Nevertheless, the trial court allowed Neyland to make his request.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">{\u00b6 68} Neyland addressed the trial court and made the following remarks about a pro se motion and his request for self-representation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-8\">Thank you, Your Honor. The first question I need to ask you is I understand that the addendum to Motion 44 was not filed in a timely manner. There is some information from the witnesses that was testified to on the witness stand that is included in the addendum, and I would like to only address that during a presentation. <em>I would like to mount my own defense from the defense table and counsel with counsel\u2019s assistance. </em>I am not requesting to be a witness. I\u2019m not a witness. I am introducing myself to the jury because they do not have any background information, personal background information, family background information, and I have no defense witnesses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b472-10\">{\u00b6 69} Neyland then discussed his concerns about the defense. Neyland claimed that there were discrepancies in witness statements that he wanted to read and mentioned his desire to read court cases into the record that involved him and his previous employers. Neyland also discussed his unhappiness with counsel because they failed to use his notes during cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-11\">{\u00b6 70} In response, the trial judge told Neyland that he had noticed that his counsel were paying attention to him when he offered points. The trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>stated, \u201cI\u2019m sure they determined that they just weren\u2019t proper issues because you don\u2019t understand what is a proper issue before the Court. So, again, I\u2019m going to deny your request to represent yourself.\u201d There was no further discussion about self-representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">b. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">{\u00b6 71} \u201cThe Sixth Amendment * * * guarantees that a defendant in a state criminal trial has an independent constitutional right of self-representation and that he may proceed to defend himself without counsel when he voluntarily, and knowingly and intelligently elects to do so.\u201d <em>State v. Gibson, </em>45 Ohio St.2d 366, 345 N.E.2d 399 (1976), paragraph one of the syllabus, citing <em>Faretta v. California, </em>422 U.S. 806, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562 (1975). If a trial court denies the right to self-representation when the right has been properly invoked, the denial is per se reversible error. <em>State v. Reed, </em>74 Ohio St.3d 534, 535, 660 N.E.2d 456 (1996), citing <em>McKaskle v. Wiggins, </em>465 U.S. 168, 177, 104 S.Ct. 944, 79 L.Ed.2d 122 (1984), fn. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">{\u00b6 72} The assertion of the right to self-representation must be clear and unequivocal. <em>State v. Dean, </em>127 Ohio St.3d 140, 2010-Ohio-5070, 937 N.E.2d 97, \u00b6 68; <em>State v. Cassano, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 94, 2002-Ohio-3751, 772 N.E.2d 81, \u00b6 38. A request for self-representation may be denied when circumstances indicate that the request is made for purposes of delay or manipulation of the trial process. <em>See United States v. Frazier-El, </em>204 F.3d 553, 560 (4th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">{\u00b6 73} First, Neyland argues that the trial court erred in failing to grant his request for self-representation on December 11, 2007. On that occasion, Neyland told the trial court that he \u201cmight have to defend himself\u2019 at the same time that he was voicing his frustration about getting discovery from the public defender\u2019s office. Other courts have held that a request for self-representation is not unequivocal if it is a \u201c \u2018momentary caprice or the result of thinking out loud,\u2019 \u201d <em>Jackson v. Ylst, </em>921 F.2d 882, 888 (9th Cir.1990), quoting <em>Adams v. Carroll, </em>875 F.2d 1441, 1445 (9th Cir.1989), or the result of frustration, <em>Reese v. Nix, </em>942 F.2d 1276, 1281 (8th Cir.1991) (defendant merely expressed frustration and did not clearly invoke his right of self-representation). Similarly, we conclude that Neyland was expressing his frustration and not clearly invoking his right to self-representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">{\u00b6 74} Defense counsel confirmed that Neyland was not invoking his right to self-representation. Counsel told the trial court during a pretrial hearing on February 12, 2008, that Neyland had \u201cnever seriously, if at all, raised the desire to represent himself.\u201d Thus, we reject Neyland\u2019s claim that his request for self-representation on December 11, 2007, was improperly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>{\u00b6 75} Second, Neyland argues that the trial court erred in failing to grant his request for self-representation after the state\u2019s case-in-chief was completed. Neyland told the court at that time, \u201cI would like to mount my own defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">{\u00b6 76} A trial court may deny a defendant\u2019s request for self-representation if it is untimely made. In <em>Cassano, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 94, 2002-Ohio-3751, 772 N.E.2d 81, at \u00b6 40, the court held that a defendant\u2019s request to represent himself made three days before trial was untimely. Other courts have also found that a request for self-representation can be denied when the request is untimely. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Young, </em>287 F.3d 1352, 1354 (11th Cir.2002) (\u201ca defendant\u2019s request to proceed <em>pro se </em>is untimely if not made before the jury is empaneled\u201d); <em>Wood v. Quarterman, </em>491 F.3d 196, 202 (5th Cir.2007) (\u201cWood did not move to proceed <em>pro se </em>until <em>after </em>the jury had already returned a guilty verdict against him, immediately before the sentencing phase of his [capital-murder] trial, and the trial court therefore had the discretion to deny the motion\u201d [emphasis sic]); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>413 F.3d 1253, 1281 (10th Cir.2005) (request made six days before trial untimely).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">{\u00b6 77} Neyland\u2019s request for self-representation was untimely because he did not make it until just before the beginning of the trial-phase closing arguments. Thus, we hold that the trial court did not err in denying Neyland\u2019s late request for self-representation.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">{\u00b6 78} But Neyland argues that the trial court sidestepped the issue and never addressed his request to waive counsel. Upon learning of Neyland\u2019s intent to request self-representation, the trial court informed the parties that he was going to deny this request because it was untimely. Nevertheless, the trial court allowed Neyland to make his request for self-representation and voice any other concerns that he had about the proceedings. After Neyland finished, the trial court said, \u201cYou\u2019ve raised these issues, and the Court is denying your request at this time.\u201d Thus, the record shows that the trial court did consider Neyland\u2019s request for self-representation and denied it for being untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">{\u00b6 79} Neyland also argues that the trial court erred by failing to consider whether he was competent to represent himself. <em>See Indiana v. Edwards, </em>554 U.S. 164, 177-178, 128 S.Ct. 2379, 171 L.Ed.2d 345 (2008). However, the trial court did not need to determine Neyland\u2019s competency to represent himself, because Neyland\u2019s underlying request was untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">{\u00b6 80} Based on the foregoing, we reject proposition XIV.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-9\">3. <em>Leg restraints </em>(Propositions of law II and III)</p>\n<p id=\"b474-10\">{\u00b6 81} In proposition of law II, Neyland argues that the trial court erred when it ordered Neyland to wear leg restraints without a valid reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>{\u00b6 82} No one should be tried while shackled, absent unusual circumstances. <em>State v. McKnight, </em>107 Ohio St.3d 101, 2005-Ohio-6046, 837 N.E.2d 315, \u00b6 219, citing <em>Illinois v. Allen, </em>397 U.S. 337, 344, 90 S.Ct. 1057, 25 L.Ed.2d 353 (1970). The use of restraints tends to erode the presumption of innocence that the justice system attaches to every defendant. <em>State v. Franklin, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 1, 2002-Ohio-5304, 776 N.E.2d 26, \u00b6 79. But it is widely accepted that a prisoner may be shackled when there is a danger of violence or escape. <em>State v. Woodards, </em>6 Ohio St.2d 14, 23, 215 N.E.2d 568 (1966). The decision to require restraints is left to the sound discretion of the trial court, which is in a position to consider the prisoner\u2019s actions both inside and outside the courtroom, as well as his demeanor while the court is in session. <em>Franklin </em>at \u00b6 79.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">a. Rulings on leg restraints</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">{\u00b6 83} On April 10, 2008, defense counsel filed a motion requesting that Neyland appear at all proceedings without restraints. On June 2, 2008, the trial court denied this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">{\u00b6 84} On August 25, 2008, during a pretrial session outside the defendant\u2019s presence, the trial court discussed the potential that Neyland might become disruptive during trial based on his propensity \u201cto insist on certain subject matters being addressed\u201d and that \u201che may become out of control a little bit\u201d if the court \u201crules against him on relevance.\u201d The trial court added, \u201cI don\u2019t know what we can do other than obviously using some sort of restraint, but I guess now is the time to talk about it so that we\u2019re not all caught off guard.\u201d The court also said, \u201cOther than that he\u2019s been pretty well-behaved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">{\u00b6 85} In response, defense counsel said, \u201cIn fairness to Calvin it\u2019s hard to predict, he\u2019s very unpredictable, but I would anticipate he would be demonstrative, not necessarily disruptive.\u201d Defense counsel also mentioned that he has had previous clients wear leg shackles that were hidden from the jury by an apron in front of counsel\u2019s table.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-10\">{\u00b6 86} During pretrial proceedings on September 24, 2008, the trial court stated that it was considering having Neyland wear either leg irons or some other leg restraint under his pants and that placing skirting around the table would ensure that the jury could not see that Neyland was restrained. The trial court also mentioned that there would be two or three deputies in the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-11\">{\u00b6 87} During pretrial proceedings on October 8, 2008, the bailiff indicated that a leg restraint had been found that would fit Neyland. He stated that Neyland would walk with a \u201cslight gate [sic],\u201d apparently meaning that Neyland\u2019s gait would be slightly impaired. During pretrial proceedings on October 15, 2008, the trial court stated that a leg restraint would be used and that a skirt around the defense counsel\u2019s table would not be necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>{\u00b6 88} After trial began, the state filed a motion to have Neyland wear two leg restraints because he had figured out how to manipulate the single one. During a hearing on the motion, the trial court asked defense counsel if they wanted to have an evidentiary hearing. Defense counsel responded, \u201cWe\u2019ll leave it up to the sheriffs department.\u201d Defense counsel added, \u201cMy experience with leg braces, * * * the defendant has figured out how to unlock it or manipulate it or something, which I think that\u2019s not a secret how to do that. * * * Again, * * * let\u2019s not do anything at this point unless the sheriff thinks it\u2019s appropriate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">{\u00b6 89} The trial court then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-6\">And he is obviously a big individual. We have tried to do the most we could in terms of not restraining him certainly in a visible way, and that\u2019s our effort is to not have the jury even be aware.. From what I\u2019ve been able to see thus far, no one would even know. What I think I\u2019ll do is authorize it but leave it at the discretion of the sheriffs department. Does that seem fair? And if they feel it\u2019s appropriate, they can do it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">{\u00b6 90} Both the prosecutor and the defense counsel expressed their agreement. The trial court said, \u201cWe\u2019ll leave it at that. That will be the order of the Court.\u201d Subsequently, the trial court issued an order granting the state\u2019s motion to require Neyland to wear a second leg restraint at trial \u201cif deemed necessary by the Wood County Sheriff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">b. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"AHM\">(1) <em>First leg restraint</em></p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">{\u00b6 91} Neyland claims that the trial court ordered him to wear restraints without any showing that restraints were necessary because of his disruptive behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-10\">{\u00b6 92} The trial court granted the state\u2019s request on shackling without first conducting a hearing to consider whether evidence showed that shackling was necessary. We continue to emphasize that prior to ordering a defendant to wear restraints, the trial court should hold a hearing on the matter. <em>Franklin, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 1, 2002-Ohio-5304, 776 N.E.2d 26, at \u00b6 82.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-11\">{\u00b6 93} The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit has held that when considering whether to physically restrain a defendant during trial, the court should conduct a formal hearing with sworn testimony to resolve factual disputes and preserve the appellate record. <em>United States v. Perry, </em>401 Fed. Appx. 56, 63 (6th Cir.2010). However, the United States Supreme Court has not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>held that such a hearing is required. <em>See Deck v. Missouri, </em>544 U.S. 622, 629, 125 S.Ct. 2007, 161 L.Ed.2d 953 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">{\u00b6 94} We have also held that a hearing on the necessity for restraints is not an \u201cabsolute rule.\u201d <em>Franklin </em>at \u00b6 82. In <em>Franklin, </em>we stated, \u201cWhere the facts and circumstances surrounding a defendant illustrate a <em>compelling need </em>to impose exceptional security procedures, the trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion in this regard should not be disturbed unless its actions are not supported by the evidence before it.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">{\u00b6 95} While there was no formal hearing, the trial court\u2019s reasons for ordering Neyland to wear a leg restraint can be gleaned from the record. During the pretrial session on August 25, 2008, the judge voiced his concerns about Neyland\u2019s potential for disruptive courtroom behavior. Defense counsel stated that Neyland was \u201cvery unpredictable\u201d and acknowledged that he \u201cwould be demonstrative, not necessarily disruptive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b477-8\">{\u00b6 96} The trial court had observed Neyland\u2019s demeanor in court. The trial court had also heard two psychologists and two psychiatrists testify at the competency hearing about Neyland\u2019s bizarre thinking and paranoid behavior. The trial court was also mindful that Neyland was a large man and that sheriffs deputies might have difficulty in handling him if he became disruptive. Neyland\u2019s driver\u2019s license stated that he stood six feet, three inches tall and weighed 250 pounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-9\">{\u00b6 97} Yet nothing shows that Neyland had been disruptive in court or had been violent or disruptive in jail. Indeed, the trial court stated that Neyland had been \u201cpretty well-behaved.\u201d <em>Compare Franklin, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 1, 2002-Ohio-5304, 776 N.E.2d 26, at \u00b6 80-81 (defendant demonstrated a propensity for violence and a psychologist described him as a \u201ctime bomb waiting to happen\u201d); <em>Cassano, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 94, 2002-Ohio-3751, 772 N.E.2d 81, at \u00b6 55 (defendant had a history of violent felonies and committed a murder in prison).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-10\">{\u00b6 98} The trial court provided limited reasoning as to why it found a compelling need to keep Neyland shackled. Yet the trial judge was in a position to consider Neyland\u2019s actions inside and outside the courtroom and voiced his concerns about Neyland\u2019s potential for disruptive courtroom behavior. A \u201ccourt need not sit by helplessly waiting for a defendant to commit a violent or disruptive act in the courtroom before being cloaked with the power to invoke extra security measures.\u201d <em>Franklin </em>at \u00b6 79. Thus, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ordering Neyland to wear a leg restraint.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-11\">(2) <em>Second leg restraint</em></p>\n<p id=\"b477-12\">{\u00b6 99} After trial began, the trial court granted the state\u2019s request for Neyland to wear a second restraint, but left it to \u201cthe discretion of the sheriffs depart<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>ment.\u201d As an initial matter, the record is unclear whether Neyland was actually placed in a second leg restraint following the trial court\u2019s ruling. In any event, defense counsel failed to object and thus waived all but plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-5\">{\u00b6 100} Neyland argues that the trial court erred by leaving the final decision on wearing a second restraint to the sheriffs discretion. \u201cThe trial court must exercise its own discretion and not leave the issue up to security personnel.\u201d <em>State v. Adams, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 508, 2004-Ohio-5845, 817 N.E.2d 29, \u00b6 104; <em>see also United States v. Miller, </em>531 F.3d 340, 345-346 (6th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">{\u00b6 101} Accordingly, the trial court erred by leaving the final decision on wearing a second leg restraint to the sheriffs discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-7\">(\u00b6 102} Even assuming that Neyland wore a second restraint for the remainder of the trial, we hold that there was no plain error. The leg restraints were under Neyland\u2019s pants and not visible to the jury. But Neyland argues that when he went to the podium to make an unsworn statement during the mitigation phase of the trial, his constrained movements must have been visible to the jury. However, nothing in the record indicates that the jury observed Neyland walking with constrained movements before he made his unsworn statement. Neyland bears the burden on plain-error review, and he has not met that burden. Thus, this claim is rejected. <em>See Miller, </em>531 F.3d at 347.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">(3) <em>Defense arguments</em></p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">{\u00b6 103} Neyland argues that the trial court failed to consider lesser alternatives, such as the employment of extra deputies, before ordering that he wear leg restraints. Some Ohio courts of appeals have held that a trial court has \u201ca duty to determine whether there is a \u2018less prejudicial but adequate means of providing security\u2019 \u201d before ordering restraints. <em>State v. McCree, </em>5th Dist. Richland No. 10CA133, 2011-Ohio-4114, 2011 WL 3652755, \u00b6 14, quoting <em>Lakin v. Stine, </em>431 F.3d 959, 964 (6th Cir.2005); <em>State v. Davis, </em>2d Dist. Clark No. 2011 CA 15, 2012-Ohio-1225, 2012 WL 996909, \u00b6 15; <em>State v. Mitchell, </em>6th Dist. Williams No. WM-05-004, 2006-Ohio-5117, 2006 WL 2790333, \u00b6 29.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-10\">{\u00b6 104} The trial court did discuss the use of deputies to provide courtroom security. The trial court also discussed the option of using a stun belt. The bailiff stated that two uniformed deputies would be with the defendant at all times. But the presence of additional deputies was not discussed as a lesser alternative to the use of leg restraints.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-11\">{\u00b6 105} The trial court should have considered whether there were lesser alternatives to the use of leg restraints to provide adequate courtroom security. Nevertheless, the trial court used restraints that were not visible to the jury rather than shackles or other visible types of restraints. Even though the record is unclear, it appears that the trial court considered the presence of deputies <em>and </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>the use of leg restraints as the least form of restraint necessary to ensure courtroom security. Under these circumstances, we reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-6\">{\u00b6 106} Finally, Neyland argues that the leg restraints inhibited his interaction with defense counsel and thus interfered with his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. However, the defense never asserted that restraints interfered with the attorney-client relationship and thus waived all but plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">{\u00b6 107} No plain error occurred. Nothing in the record indicates that Neyland\u2019s leg restraints inhibited his communication with counsel with respect to his defense. Both of Neyland\u2019s hands were free throughout the trial. Neyland also does not claim that the restraints impeded his ability to follow the proceedings and take an active interest in the presentation of his case. Indeed, when asking to represent himself, Neyland said that he had taken pages and pages of notes that he wanted counsel to use during cross-examination. The trial court responded, \u201cI noticed that they [defense counsel] were paying attention to you when you offered points.\u201d <em>See State v. Chester, </em>10th Dist. Franklin No. 08AP-1, 2008-Ohio-6679, 2008 WL 5265860, \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">(4) <em>Harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt</em></p>\n<p id=\"b479-9\">{\u00b6 108} Even assuming that the trial court abused its discretion in ordering Neyland shackled, we find that such error was harmless. Nothing in the record shows that the jury observed Neyland in leg restraints, and he was not prejudiced.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-10\">{\u00b6 109} Moreover, even if the jurors <em>obseded </em>Neyland in shackles, any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b479-11\">[W]here a court, without adequate justification, orders the defendant to wear <em>shackles that unit be seen by the jury, </em>the defendant need not demonstrate actual prejudice to make out a due process violation. The State must prove \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt that the [shackling] error complained of did not contribute to the verdict obtained.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b479-12\">(Emphasis added.) <em>Deck, </em>544 U.S. at 635, 125 S.Ct. 2007, 161 L.Ed.2d 953, quoting <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-13\">{\u00b6 110} The state can meet this burden because overwhelming evidence of Neyland\u2019s guilt was presented at trial. Evidence showed that Neyland was scheduled to meet with Lazar and Smith about the termination of his employment as a truck driver with Liberty Transportation. After arriving at Liberty, Neyland shot Lazar several times in the back and then walked upstairs to Smith\u2019s office and shot him once in the head. Neyland\u2019s murder of Smith can be heard <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>on a 9-1-1 tape that was introduced at trial. A handgun was found in Neyland\u2019s truck after the police arrested him. Forensic testing matched this handgun with bullets and shell casings found at the murder scene and with a bullet recovered from the autopsy of Thomas Lazar. Gunshot residue was found on Neyland\u2019s hands. Investigators also found pieces of paper in Neyland\u2019s storage unit on which three pennies were arranged in a triangular pattern that matched the triangular gunshot pattern on Lazar\u2019s back. The paper contained the words, \u201cOOOO, I\u2019m so scared. Three Round Shot Group.\u201d There was also the statement, \u201cYou think I\u2019m playing[.] You\u2019re gonna come up missing!!!\u201d Thus, there is little chance that leg restraints, even if observable, affected the verdict or the sentence in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">{\u00b6 111} In proposition of law III, Neyland argues that defense counsel provided ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to object to the trial court\u2019s order that he wear leg restraints. Neyland also argues that counsel was deficient by failing to set forth the relevant case law on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">{\u00b6 112} Reversal of a conviction for ineffective assistance requires that the defendant show, first, that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and, second, that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense so as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). <em>Accord State v. Bradley, </em>42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373 (1989), paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">{\u00b6 113} Contrary to Neyland\u2019s claim, the record shows that defense counsel filed a pretrial motion asking that Neyland appear at all proceedings without restraints. Review of defense counsel\u2019s motion also shows that it included citations to relevant case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">{\u00b6 114} Yet defense counsel failed to renew their objection when the state requested that Neyland be ordered to wear a second leg restraint. The record is unclear whether Neyland was actually placed in a second restraint after the trial court\u2019s order. But even assuming that he was, he cannot establish any resulting prejudice, because nothing shows that the leg restraints were visible to the jury. <em>See State v. Ayers, </em>12th Dist. Warren Nos. CA2010-12-119 and CA2010-12-120, 2011-Ohio-4719, 2011 WL 4346678, \u00b6 61. Thus, this claim lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">{\u00b6 115} Based on the foregoing, we overrule propositions II and III.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">4. <em>Failure to file motions to suppress </em>(Proposition of law VII)</p>\n<p id=\"b480-10\">{\u00b6 \u00cd16} Neyland argues that trial counsel were ineffective by failing to file motions to suppress his statements to police and the evidence seized from the search of his motel room.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>a. Failure to challenge admission of Neyland\u2019s pretrial statements</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">{\u00b6 117} Under <em>Strickland, </em>Neyland must demonstrate that trial counsel were deficient. This requires Neyland to establish that a basis existed to suppress his pretrial statements. <em>Adams, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 508, 2004-Ohio-5845, 817 N.E.2d 29, at \u00b6 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-6\">{\u00b6 118} The state introduced statements Neyland made to the SWAT team at the time of his arrest outside the Silver Blue Motel. Det. Sgt. Enrico Galimberti, the SWAT team leader, testified that Neyland was removed from his tractor and placed on the ground with his hands out to the side. According to Galimberti, Neyland blurted out, \u201cI was going to turn myself in.\u201d He also said, \u201cI want the letter. There\u2019s a letter in my truck. It\u2019s to my brother. It\u2019s my last will. Can I get that letter?\u201d Before handcuffing Neyland, Galimberti asked Neyland if he had any weapons. Neyland responded, \u201cNo, the gun is in the truck by the door.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b481-7\">{\u00b6 119} First, the requirement that police officers administer <em>Miranda </em>warnings applies only when a suspect is subjected to both custody and interrogation. <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 444, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966) (prohibiting \u201ccustodial interrogation\u201d without warnings). Neyland was arrested and almost immediately stated that he was going to turn himself in and wanted the letter containing his last will that was in the tractor. An unsolicited and spontaneous statement such as the one made by Neyland in this case is not the product of interrogation, so <em>Miranda </em>does not apply. <em>Rhode Island v. Innis, </em>446 U.S. 291, 300, 100 S.Ct. 1682, 64 L.Ed.2d 297 (1980); <em>State v. Dunn, </em>131 Ohio St.3d 325, 2012-Ohio-1008, 964 N.E.2d 1037, \u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-8\">{\u00b6 120} Second, under the public-safety exception to <em>Miranda </em>established in <em>New York v. Quarles, </em>467 U.S. 649, 104 S.Ct. 2626, 81 L.Ed.2d 550 (1984), police officers can ask a suspect questions without first giving <em>Miranda </em>warnings if they reasonably believe it is \u201cnecessary to secure their own safety or the safety of the public.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 659. Recognizing a \u201cnarrow exception\u201d to the <em>Miranda </em>rule, <em>id. </em>at 658, <em>Quarles </em>reasoned that \u201cthe need for answers to questions in a situation posing a threat to the public safety outweighs the need for the prophylactic rule protecting the Fifth Amendment\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 657. Galimberti asked Neyland about the whereabouts of a weapon, because a gun had been used recently in killing Lazar and Smith. Moreover, Neyland was arrested in the parking area of a motel and the firearm would have posed a threat to public safety. Thus, Galimberti\u2019s questioning appears to have been warranted by the public-safety exception to <em>Miranda.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b481-9\">{\u00b6 121} Neyland argues that trial counsel should have filed a motion to suppress his statements because of his history of mental-health problems, including, at a minimum, a severe personality disorder. However, Neyland\u2019s mental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>problems would not serve as a basis for challenging either Neyland\u2019s unsolicited and spontaneous statements or his response to the question about weapons. <em>See Colorado v. Connelly, </em>479 U.S. 157, 107 S.Ct. 515, 93 L.Ed.2d 473 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">{\u00b6 122} Trial counsel could have decided that any motion to suppress Neyland\u2019s statements to the police would have been pointless. <em>See Adams, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 508, 2004-Ohio-5845, 817 N.E.2d 29, at \u00b6 38. Accordingly, we hold that trial counsel were not deficient by failing to challenge the admissibility of Neyland\u2019s pretrial statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-6\">b. Failure to challenge search warrant</p>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">{\u00b6 123} Neyland argues that his counsel were ineffective by failing to file a motion to suppress the evidence seized during the search of his motel room. The search yielded numerous weapons and other evidence that was admitted at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-8\">{\u00b6 124} Following Neyland\u2019s arrest, Michigan authorities obtained a search warrant for what they believed to be Neyland\u2019s motel room. A search of that room uncovered no evidence. On the following day, the police learned that they had searched the wrong room. Monroe County Sheriffs Detective Tom Redmond then obtained a search warrant for the motel room where Neyland had actually stayed. Police searching that motel room seized an array of firearms and ammunition, a stun gun, handcuffs, and a couple of Hawaiian shirts.</p>\n<p id=\"b482-9\">{\u00b6 125} During trial, Neyland filed a pro se motion challenging the legality of the search warrant used in searching his motel room. The trial court denied the motion as not timely filed. Following the completion of the state\u2019s case, the trial court revisited Neyland\u2019s motion, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-10\">After hearing the testimony, and, by the way, I ruled that it was not timely filed. Now that I have heard the testimony on all of it and have these exhibits, I do find that there is no basis to take those back. There was certainly probable cause for each of these search warrants. They appeared to be only obtained after there was probable cause, and they appeared to be properly executed. So Pm going to so rule at this time and consider, since the motion wasn\u2019t filed in time to have a separate hearing on that issue, the Court is going to determine it on its own based on the exhibits.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-11\">{\u00b6 126} \u201c \u2018Where the record contains no evidence which would justify the filing of a motion to suppress, the appellant has not met his burden of proving that his attorney violated an essential duty by failing to file the motion.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Drummond, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 14, 2006-Ohio-5084, 854 N.E.2d 1038, \u00b6 208, quoting <em>State v. Gibson, </em>69 Ohio App.2d 91, 95, 430 N.E.2d 954 (8th Dist.1980). Further, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>\u201c \u2018failure to file a suppression motion does not constitute per se ineffective assistance of counsel.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Madrigal, </em>87 Ohio St.3d 378, 389, 721 N.E.2d 52 (2000), quoting <em>Kimmelman v. Morrison, </em>477 U.S. 365, 384, 106 S.Ct. 2574, 91 L.Ed.2d 305 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">{\u00b6 127} Neyland specifies no reason why the search warrant could have been legitimately challenged. The affidavit for the search warrant provided detailed facts supporting probable cause for the search of Neyland\u2019s motel room. The search warrant specified the location to be searched (the motel room) and the property to be searched for and seized (9 mm handgun and other weapons and evidence pertinent to the investigation). Thus, the warrant was valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">{\u00b6 128} Moreover, the trial court ultimately found that there was probable cause for the search of the motel room. Thus, Neyland cannot show that he was prejudiced by trial counsel\u2019s failure to file a motion to suppress. This claim also lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-6\">{\u00b6 129} Based on the foregoing, we overrule proposition VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-7\">5. <em>Jury selection </em>(Proposition of law XI)</p>\n<p id=\"b483-8\">{\u00b6 130} Neyland argues that the trial court erred in excusing four prospective jurors. He argues that under <em>Witherspoon v. Illinois, </em>391 U.S. 510, 88 S.Ct. 1770, 20 L.Ed.2d 776 (1968), and R.C. 2945.25(C), it is improper to excuse a prospective juror for cause in the death-qualification process unless that juror unequivocally states that he would not recommend death under any circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">{\u00b6 131} However, the constitutional standard for determining when a prospective juror may be excluded for cause based upon his or her views on capital punishment is whether the juror\u2019s views would prevent or substantially impair the performance of his duties as a juror in accordance with his instructions and oath. <em>Wainwright v. Witt, </em>469 U.S. 412, 424, 105 S.Ct. 844, 83 L.Ed.2d 841 (1985); <em>State v. Rogers, </em>17 Ohio St.3d 174, 478 N.E.2d 984 (1985), paragraph three of the syllabus. This court has held that if a juror satisfies the <em>Witt </em>criterion, he may be excluded for cause under the catch-all provision of R.C. 2945.25(0) even though he does not satisfy the more specific R.C. 2945.25(C). <em>State v. Williams, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 493, 2003-Ohio-4396, 794 N.E.2d 27, \u00b6 40. Thus, we evaluate Neyland\u2019s claim under the <em>Witt </em>standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-10\">{\u00b6 132} First, Neyland argues that the trial court abused its discretion in excusing prospective juror No. 17, because this juror stated that he could follow the court\u2019s instructions. During voir dire, juror No. 17 stated that he could follow the court\u2019s instructions \u201cin most cases.\u201d When asked to explain, juror No. 17 stated that \u201cthere is a thing called juror nullification that I might have to consider given the certain circumstances, which I think would be rare.\u201d The trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>court then asked, \u2018You understand that if you did do that, you would be violating your oath as a juror?\u201d Juror No. 17 replied, \u201cWell, I think there is a higher oath than this.\u201d Over defense objection, the trial court excused this juror for cause, because \u201che just couldn\u2019t unequivocally indicate he would follow the Court\u2019s instruction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">{\u00b6 133} A trial court\u2019s resolution of a challenge for cause will be upheld on appeal unless it is unsupported by substantial testimony. <em>Williams </em>at \u00b6 45. Juror No. 17 refused to promise to follow the trial court\u2019s instructions and reserved the right to consider engaging in juror nullification in some circumstances. Thus, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excusing this juror for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-6\">{\u00b6 134} Second, Neyland argues that the trial court abused its discretion in excusing prospective juror No. 24 for cause, because that juror stated that she could vote to impose the death penalty, even though she expressed reluctance to provide a blanket \u201cyes\u201d that would cover all contingencies. Juror No. 24 was opposed to the death penalty. She provided contradictory answers as to whether she would follow the instructions on the death penalty. Juror No. 24 told the trial court, \u201cI could follow [the instructions]; but I don\u2019t know if my view would change or not. I can\u2019t say at this time.\u201d She also told the prosecutor, \u201cI honestly can\u2019t say,\u201d when asked whether she would follow such instructions. Juror No. 24 told defense counsel, \u201cYeah, I guess I would consider that.\u201d Over defense objection, juror No. 24 was excused for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-7\">{\u00b6 135} This juror\u2019s final statement to defense counsel, viewed in isolation, does not suggest that she would be substantially impaired in performing her duties as a juror. \u201cHowever, where a prospective juror gives contradictory answers on voir dire, the trial judge need not accept the last answer elicited by counsel as the prospective juror\u2019s definitive word. * * * Rather, \u2018it is for the trial court to determine which answer reflects the juror\u2019s true state of mind.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Group, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 248, 2002-Ohio-7247, 781 N.E.2d 980, \u00b6 66, quoting <em>State v. Jones, </em>91 Ohio St.3d 335, 339, 744 N.E.2d 1163 (2001). Juror No. 24 equivocated on whether she would follow the trial court\u2019s instructions. Thus, substantial evidence supported excluding this juror. We hold that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in doing so. <em>See State v. Bethel, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 416, 2006-Ohio-4853, 854 N.E.2d 150, \u00b6 123.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">{\u00b6 136} Third, Neyland argues that the trial court abused its discretion in excusing prospective juror No. 55, because this juror provided \u201cstrong answers\u201d indicating that she could follow the law. Juror No. 55 stated that she \u201cwould have a hard time doing it,\u201d but she would follow the instructions on the death penalty, \u201c[i]f legally I have to do it.\u201d There was also the following exchange:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>The Court: So there are some times when you could get by your personal beliefs and impose the death penalty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-6\">Juror 55: Possibly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-7\">The Court: You\u2019re still hedging on me here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-8\">Juror 55: I know I am. I cannot say 100 percent, yes, I could do it or, no, I cannot, first of all because I\u2019ve never truly had to make that decision on somebody\u2019s life. And we all think about it. But when it truly comes down to me having to make that decision in that instance when I had to answer that, I still go, I\u2019m not a hundred percent convinced either way.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">{\u00b6 137} The trial court, over defense objection, excused juror No. 55 for cause, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-10\">She was not unequivocal about anything. And if that\u2019s an understatement, I apologize. I\u2019m going to find that her beliefs do impair her ability to serve as a juror. Even though she did seem to voice some desire to please the Court, she also seemed to indicate that her personal beliefs were such that she just couldn\u2019t do it. So that\u2019s a close call, I have to admit * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-11\">{\u00b6 138} The record supports the trial court\u2019s decision to excuse juror No. 55. She provided equivocal responses on her ability to follow the trial court\u2019s instructions on the death penalty. Moreover, on her juror questionnaire, juror No. 55 responded \u201cNo\u201d when asked whether she could \u201cconsider fairly\u201d the court\u2019s instructions on the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-12\">{\u00b6 139} Neyland argues that juror No. 55 should not have been excused, because the trial court acknowledged that his decision was a \u201cclose call.\u201d But the trial court\u2019s determination that juror No. 55 was impaired is entitled to deference. Where, as here, a juror gives conflicting answers, it is for the trial court to determine which answer reflects the juror\u2019s true state of mind. <em>Jones, </em>91 Ohio St.3d at 339, 744 N.E.2d 1163.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-13\">{\u00b6 140} Finally, Neyland argues that the trial court abused its discretion in excusing prospective juror No. Ill for cause, because this juror expressed his willingness to follow the law. Juror No. Ill stated that his religious beliefs would make it difficult to impose the death penalty: \u201cI believe that * * * God has that say of whether to take life. And again, only as a last resort and if I\u2019m commanded to by you people. But I certainly wouldn\u2019t want to make that decision by any means if I didn\u2019t have to, you know.\u201d Juror No. Ill also acknowledged that his religious beliefs \u201cwould be a factor\u201d in weighing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>aggravating circumstances and the mitigating factors. But juror No. Ill also stated that he would \u201cfollow the law.\u201d Over defense objection, juror No. Ill was excused for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">{\u00b6 141} \u201cA prospective juror\u2019s conscientious or religious opposition to the death penalty in and of itself is not grounds for a challenge for cause.\u201d <em>State v. Treesh, </em>90 Ohio St.3d 460, 468, 739 N.E.2d 749 (2001). But juror No. Ill\u2019s answers demonstrate that his strong religious views might impair his ability to perform his duties as a juror. Indeed, he indicated that he would recommend death \u201conly * * * if I\u2019m commanded to by you people,\u201d which would never happen.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">{\u00b6 142} Moreover, the trial court had also reviewed juror No. Ill\u2019s questionnaire. On the questionnaire, the prospective jurors were asked, \u201cIf instructed by the Court to consider fairly the imposition of a sentence of death, would you be able to follow the Instruction?\u201d Juror No. Ill responded, \u201cIf this court or my country asked me to and I had no other choice I guese [sic] I would have to, I really believe it is up to god weather [sic] we live or die, I believe it is God desicision [sic].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b486-7\">{\u00b6 143} Here again, the trial court\u2019s determination that juror No. Ill\u2019s religious views \u201cwould substantially impair the performance of his duties\u201d is entitled to deference. <em>See Bethel, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 416, 2006-Ohio-4853, 854 N.E.2d 150, at \u00b6 126. We hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excusing this juror for cause. Proposition XI is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-8\">6. <em>Prosecutorial misconduct </em>(Proposition of law XII)</p>\n<p id=\"b486-9\">{\u00b6 144} Neyland argues that the prosecutor committed misconduct by making improper victim-impact comments and eliciting improper victim-impact testimony. But defense counsel failed to object to the prosecutor\u2019s comments and questions and thus waived all but plain error. <em>State v. Childs, </em>14 Ohio St.2d 56, 236 N.E.2d 545 (1968), paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-10\">{\u00b6 145} The test for prosecutorial misconduct is whether the remarks were improper and, if so, whether they prejudicially affected the accused\u2019s substantial rights. <em>State v. Smith, </em>14 Ohio St.3d 13, 14, 470 N.E.2d 883 (1984). The touchstone of the analysis \u201cis the fairness of the trial, not the culpability of the prosecutor.\u201d <em>Smith v. Phillips, </em>455 U.S. 209, 219, 102 S.Ct. 940, 71 L.Ed.2d 78 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b486-11\">{\u00b6 146} First, Neyland argues that the prosecutor committed misconduct during opening statements by remarking, \u201cI\u2019d really like to introduce you to Doug Smith and Tomm Lazar, unfortunately I\u2019m never going to be able to do that because the Defendant, Calvin Neyland, Jr., purposely killed them on August 8th, 2007.\u201d Neyland asserts that these comments were irrelevant to his guilt or innocence and inflamed the passions of the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>{\u00b6 147} During opening statements, counsel is accorded latitude and allowed fair comment on the facts to be presented at trial. <em>State v. Leonard, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 54, 2004-Ohio-6235, 818 N.E.2d 229, \u00b6 157. However, it is questionable whether the prosecutor\u2019s comment about Lazar\u2019s and Smith\u2019s inability to appear was proper. <em>See State v. Biros, </em>78 Ohio St.3d 426, 454, 678 N.E.2d 891 (1997) (prosecutor\u2019s argument that unlike the defendant, the deceased victim \u201cdid not have the opportunity to testify\u201d was improper). But the comments were brief and not overly emotional. Moreover, the trial court instructed the jury that the opening statements of counsel were not evidence. Thus, no plain error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-6\">{\u00b6 148} Next, Neyland argues that the prosecutor committed misconduct by presenting testimony that Lucinda Collins was Smith\u2019s fianc\u00e9e. During her introductory testimony, Collins testified that she had been engaged to Smith for two years. Neyland contends that such testimony constituted improper victim-impact evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-7\">{\u00b6 149} \u201cEvidence relating to the facts attendant to the offense is \u2018clearly admissible\u2019 during the guilt phase, even though it might be characterized as victim-impact evidence.\u201d <em>McKnigkt, </em>107 Ohio St.3d 101, 2005-Ohio-6046, 837 N.E.2d 315, at \u00b6 98, quoting <em>State v. Fautenberry, </em>72 Ohio St.3d 435, 440, 650 N.E.2d 878 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">{\u00b6 150} Collins\u2019s preliminary testimony about her relationship with Doug Smith explained why she was knowledgeable about Smith\u2019s problems with Neyland and laid the foundation for Collins\u2019s later testimony about these matters. <em>See State v. Hartman, </em>93 Ohio St.3d 274, 293, 754 N.E.2d 1150 (2001). We hold that Collins\u2019s testimony was relevant, and no plain error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-9\">{\u00b6 151} Based on the foregoing, we reject proposition XII.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-10\">7. <em>Other weapons and ammunition </em>(Proposition of law XV)</p>\n<p id=\"b487-11\">{\u00b6 152} Neyland argues that the trial court erred in allowing the state to introduce evidence of weapons and ammunition not related to the charged offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-12\">a. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b487-13\">{\u00b6 153} The state presented photographs of weapons and ammunition that the police seized during their search of Neyland\u2019s motel room and storage units. The state also presented a cooler bag containing a stun gun, two knives, handcuffs, and 9 mm ammunition. These weapons and ammunition were not linked to the murders themselves. But the state argued that such evidence was relevant to prove Neyland\u2019s prior calculation and design, which is an element of the aggravated-murder charges. The trial court, over defense objection, permitted police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>officers to testify about these weapons and ammunition and also admitted their photographs.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">(1) <em>Neyland\u2019s storage unit</em></p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">{\u00b6 154} Perrysburg Detective Monica Gottfried testified about the weapons and ammunition found in one of Neyland\u2019s storage units and used photographs to show them to the jury. Four of these photographs displayed two rifles with silencers and two cases of ammunition. A separate photograph displayed all the weapons and ammunition that the police found in the storage unit, including at least six rifles.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">(2) <em>Neyland\u2019s motel room</em></p>\n<p id=\"b488-7\">{\u00b6 155} Perrysburg Detective James Gross testified about the weapons and ammunition found in Neyland\u2019s motel room. He said that \u201cit appeared to be an arsenal.\u201d Gross found weapons on the floor next to the bed. He used a photograph to show the weapons and ammunition after they had been placed on the bed. This photograph displayed two rifles, a handgun, several weapons magazines, and boxes of ammunition. Gross also testified that a cooler bag found in the room contained a camouflaged lock-blade knife, a folding-blade Leather-man-style tool knife, a stun gun, a pair of handcuffs, and two magazines loaded with 9 mm ammunition.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">b. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b488-9\">{\u00b6 156} In <em>State v. Trimble, </em>122 Ohio St.3d 297, 2009-Ohio-2961, 911 N.E.2d 242, the state presented evidence about firearms and ammunition that were seized from the defendant but not used in the murders. The trial court, over defense objection, permitted testimony that 19 firearms not used in the murders were found in the defendant\u2019s basement. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 102-103. The state argued that the firearms in the basement were relevant in proving that Trimble murdered the victim with prior calculation and design as charged in one of the aggravated-murder counts. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 105. This court stated: \u201cWe reject this argument because the weapon used to kill [the victim] was unmistakably identified and admitted into evidence. The other firearms were not used in [the victim\u2019s] murder and thus had no relevance to prove that Trimble murdered her with prior calculation and design.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 106.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-10\">{\u00b6 157} As in <em>Trimble, </em>the 9 mm handgun used in killing Lazar and Smith was identified and admitted into evidence. The other weapons and ammunition found in Neyland\u2019s motel room and storage unit had no connection with the murders. Thus, these other weapons and ammunition had no relevance in proving Neyland\u2019s prior calculation and design as charged in the aggravated-murder offenses. We hold that the trial court erred in admitting this other evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"AGC\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>c. Harmless error</p>\n<p id=\"b489-3\">{\u00b6 158} We must now determine whether the erroneous admission of the weapons and ammunition constituted harmless error. \u201cNonconstitutional error is harmless if there is substantial other evidence to support the guilty verdict.\u201d <em>State v. Webb, 70 </em>Ohio St.3d 325, 335, 638 N.E.2d 1023 (1994). In <em>Trimble, </em>we employed such an analysis in finding that the error in admitting the firearms was harmless. _ In that case, we found that overwhelming evidence established Trimble\u2019s guilt. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 111. We also concluded that the jury did not impose the death penalty based on the fact that Trimble owned many firearms. <em>Id. </em>In reaching that conclusion, we emphasized that the firearms found in the basement were not readmitted during the penalty phase. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b489-4\">{\u00b6 159} As discussed in proposition II, overwhelming evidence was introduced that established Neyland\u2019s guilt. Moreover, the evidence of Neyland\u2019s other weapons and ammunition was less prejudicial than the presentation of such evidence in <em>Trimble. </em>In <em>Trimble, </em>the state displayed the weapons and ammunition upon two long tables in the courtroom during the testimony of one of the police officers. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 114. The trial court also allowed the firearms to be in the jury room during the trial-phase deliberations. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 115. In contrast, the prosecutor in the present case introduced mostly photographs of the firearms and ammunition, and the photographs were not readmitted during the penalty phase. Thus, we conclude that the jury did not impose the death penalty because of the other weapons and ammunition. Proposition XV is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">B. <em>Penalty-phase issues</em></p>\n<p id=\"AF5\">1. <em>Former testimony </em>(Proposition of law XIII)</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">{\u00b6 160} Neyland argues that the trial court erred in admitting the former testimony of Dr. Delaney Smith as a rebuttal witness in the penalty phase, because it violated his right to confrontation and due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">a. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b489-8\">{\u00b6 161} Dr. Thomas G. Sherman, a psychiatrist, testified as a defense mitigation witness. Dr. Sherman had conducted a competency evaluation of Neyland, and he testified during mitigation that \u201cit was crystal clear to me that [Neyland] had a mental illness, and I thought he was incompetent to stand trial.\u201d Dr. Sherman diagnosed Neyland with \u201c[o]ne * * * a delusional disorder, a persecutory type. And second * * * schizophrenia, a more severe form of that illness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">{\u00b6 162} Dr. Sherman provided examples of Neyland\u2019s behavior that supported his findings. First, Neyland moved out of his house and into his truck because he believed that people were breaking into his house to listen to his answering machine. Second, Neyland mentioned that prophylactics were showing up all the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>time in his laundry. Finally, Neyland left bizarre notes in his storage unit saying, \u201cI\u2019m so scared\u201d and other comments possibly related to the killings.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">{\u00b6 163} As it relates to the mitigating factors, Dr. Sherman testified that at the time of committing these offenses, because of a mental disease or defect, Neyland lacked substantial capacity to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Dr. Sherman concluded, \u201c[A]ll of this indicates to me [that] he had a severe mental illness of a paranoid type, that he suspected virtually everybody of something, that probably would have not taken very much to tip him off.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">{\u00b6 164} The state called Dr. Barbra Bergman and Dr. Kristen Haskins as rebuttal witnesses. Both witnesses had also conducted competency evaluations of Neyland. Dr. Bergman, a psychologist, testified that Neyland was not suffering from a mental illness but had a severe personality disorder. Dr. Bergman stated that she could not determine whether Neyland lacked substantial capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct because Neyland would not talk to her about his criminal conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">{\u00b6 165} Dr. Haskins, a psychologist, testified that Neyland had a \u201cmixed personality disorder.\u201d She stated, \u201c[H]e\u2019s capable of choosing his behaviors and actions and of making decisions. And there were no indications that those were tainted by any kind of severe mental illness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">{\u00b6 166} Dr. Delaney Smith, a psychiatrist, was also a rebuttal witness, although she was not present for the hearing. The prosecutor sought to introduce Dr. Smith\u2019s former testimony at the competency hearing in lieu of calling her as a witness in the penalty phase, because she was on maternity leave. The prosecutor stated that Dr. Smith had been subpoenaed, but that the legal department at Twin Valley Behavioral Health Care, where Dr. Smith worked, notified the state that Dr. Smith was unavailable because she was on maternity leave. The prosecutor also presented a letter from a nursing supervisor at Twin Valley, dated November 3, 2008, stating that Dr. Smith was aware of the subpoena, but was currently on maternity leave and \u201cwill be unavailable until after the first of the year.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-8\">{\u00b6 167} Defense counsel objected to admitting Dr. Smith\u2019s former testimony from the competency proceedings during mitigation, arguing that \u201cthe issue before the Court at that time is significantly different than the issue before the jury today.\u201d The defense asked that Dr. Smith\u2019s testimony be excluded, on the basis that \u201cthe party against whom the testimony [is] being offered does not have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>the same motive to develop testimony today as we would have had back in the competency hearing * *</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">{\u00b6 168} The trial court overruled the defense objection, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-5\">And in looking at this * * *, hearsay is permitted even though the unavailability of this witness would probably make the transcript admissible regardless, so hearsay is not really, and I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s the defense\u2019s objection, the competency issue, the fact that that was advanced, the testimony was advanced during the competency hearing and so has all the rest of the testimony that we\u2019ve heard thus far in this proceeding and this phase of it. So I don\u2019t see how that would be a problem in terms of objections. I\u2019m going to overrule the objection and permit the State to proceed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">{\u00b6 169} Thereafter, the state read to the jury the transcript of Dr. Smith\u2019s former testimony from the competency hearing. Dr. Smith stated that she observed Neyland during his 30-day inpatient stay for a competency evaluation at Twin Valley. Dr. Smith detected no signs of mental illness, but determined that Neyland had a paranoid personality disorder. Dr. Smith reviewed Dr. Sherman\u2019s report and stated that she had \u201cmore time to observe and interact with Mr. Neyland and see him in various different settings and see his interactions with different people.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">{\u00b6 170} The former testimony included Dr. Smith\u2019s cross-examination. Dr. Smith acknowledged that it was not her job to do a competency evaluation of Neyland, and she did not complete a written report. Dr. Smith stated that she saw signs that Neyland had a paranoid personality disorder. She also reviewed Neyland\u2019s results on the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (\u201cMMPI\u201d) and stated that Neyland answered questions in such a way as to present himself in a very positive light. She also recognized that Neyland scored extremely low in the reasoning category of the MacCAT-CA, but characterized such low scores as resulting from his personality disorder. During redirect examination, Dr. Smith expressed her opinion that Neyland was competent to stand trial. On recross, Dr. Smith again stated that Neyland has a personality disorder. But she stated that Neyland can still make reasoned choices.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-8\">b. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b491-9\">{\u00b6 171} Neyland argues that the trial court erred in admitting Dr. Smith\u2019s former testimony from the competency hearing. Neyland claims that defense counsel\u2019s inability to cross-examine Dr. Smith denied him the right to confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>{\u00b6 172} The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides, \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right * * * to be confronted with the witnesses against him * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">{\u00b6 173} In <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 68, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), the Supreme Court held that the admission of a testimonial hearsay statement made by a declarant who does not testify at trial violates the Sixth Amendment unless (1) the declarant is unavailable and (2) the defendant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine the declarant.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">{\u00b6 174} While <em>Crawford </em>did not establish a precise definition of the term \u201ctestimonial,\u201d the Supreme Court did provide some guidance, holding that, at a minimum, statements are testimonial if the declarant made them at a \u201cpreliminary hearing, before a grand jury, or at a former trial; and [in] police interrogations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 68. Dr. Smith\u2019s former testimony was presented during the competency hearing that was conducted during an earlier stage of Neyland\u2019s trial. Thus, Dr. Smith\u2019s testimony constituted a testimonial statement and unless it met the two requirements of <em>Crawford, </em>its admission violated Neyland\u2019s constitutional right to confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">(1) <em>Unavailability</em></p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">{\u00b6 175} The trial court determined that Dr. Smith was unavailable to testify because she was on maternity leave. Neyland asserts that it is questionable whether Dr. Smith was truly unavailable and whether the state made a good-faith effort to procure her attendance.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">{\u00b6 176} Yet defense counsel did not object to Dr. Smith\u2019s former testimony on the basis that her unavailability had not been established. Given defense counsel\u2019s failure to dispute unavailability, Neyland has waived all but plain error as to this point. <em>See State v. Pasqualone, </em>121 Ohio St.3d 186, 2009-Ohio-315, 903 N.E.2d 270, \u00b6 14 (\u201cConfrontation Clause rights, like other constitutional rights, can be waived\u201d); <em>State v. Mitchell, </em>2d Dist. Montgomery No. 24797, 2012-Ohio-3722, 2012 WL 3542309, \u00b6 10 (failure to object on the basis of unavailability constitutes waiver).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">{\u00b6 177} An alleged error is plain error only if the error is \u201c \u2018obvious,\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Barnes, </em>94 Ohio St.3d 21, 27, 759 N.E.2d 1240 (2002), quoting <em>State v. Sanders, </em>92 Ohio St.3d 245, 257, 750 N.E.2d 90 (2001), and \u201cbut for the error, the outcome of the trial clearly would have been otherwise,\u201d <em>State v. Long, </em>53 Ohio St.2d 91, 372 N.E.2d 804 (1978), paragraph two of the syllabus. Notice of plain error \u201cis to be taken with the utmost caution, under exceptional circumstances and only to prevent a manifest miscarriage of justice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>{\u00b6 178} We hold that no plain error occurred. Dr. Smith\u2019s testimony was cumulative. Dr. Bergman and Dr. Haskins provided similar testimony that rebutted Dr. Sherman\u2019s testimony about Neyland\u2019s mental condition. Indeed, a review of Dr. Smith\u2019s testimony shows that she provided little information that was not also provided by the state\u2019s other two rebuttal witnesses. Thus, no outcome-determinative plain error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">(2) <em>Prior Opportunity for Cross-Examination</em></p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">{\u00b6 179} The trial court permitted Dr. Smith\u2019s former testimony to be introduced over a defense objection that trial counsel did not have an opportunity and similar motive to cross-examine Dr. Smith at the competency hearing about Dr. Sherman\u2019s conclusion that Neyland\u2019s mental illness met the requirements as an R.C. 2929.04(B)(3) mitigating factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-8\">{\u00b6 180} <em>Crawford </em>requires a prior opportunity for the defendant to cross-examine the declarant about the testimonial statement sought to be admitted. The \u201cprior opportunity to cross-examine\u201d is both a \u201cnecessary\u201d and \u201cdispositive\u201d requirement for the admission of testimonial statements. <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 55, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-9\">{\u00b6 181} Neyland argues, in effect, that <em>Crawford </em>incorporates the \u201csimilar motive\u201d requirement set forth in Evid.R. 804(B)(1). <em>Crawford </em>did not state whether the Confrontation Clause requires a defendant to have had both an opportunity and a similar motive to cross-examine. <em>See Contreras, </em>979 So.2d at 909. However, in <em>United States v. Hargrove, </em>382 Fed.Appx. 765, 778 (10th Cir.2010), the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-10\"><em>Crawford </em>requires only that the defendant have an opportunity to cross-examine the adverse witness at the prior proceeding \u2014 it does not require that the defendant have a similar motive at the prior proceeding. The prior motive requirement comes from the Federal Rules of Evidence, not the Confrontation Clause. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 804(b)(1).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-11\">{\u00b6 182} However, Dr. Smith\u2019s former testimony must also meet the requirements of Evid.R. 804(B)(1) to be admissible. Thus, we must examine whether trial counsel had the opportunity and a similar motive to cross-examine Dr. Smith during the competency proceedings. \u201cAn identical motive to develop testimony is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>not required by Evid.R. 804(B)(1), only a similar motive.\u201d <em>State v. White, </em>2d Dist. Montgomery No. 20324, 2005-Ohio-212, 2005 WL 120059, \u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">{\u00b6 183} During mitigation, Dr. Sherman testified that he had conducted a competency evaluation and determined that Neyland had a mental illness and was incompetent to stand trial. Dr. Sherman also testified that Neyland\u2019s mental illness qualified as an R.C. 2929.04(B)(3) mitigating factor. But Dr. Smith\u2019s former testimony did not purport to rebut Dr. Sherman\u2019s findings regarding the R.C. 2929.04(B)(3) factor. Rather, Dr. Smith\u2019s rebuttal was limited to challenging Dr. Sherman\u2019s findings that Neyland was incompetent and suffered from a mental illness.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-6\">{\u00b6 184} During the competency hearing, Dr. Smith had also testified that she disagreed with Dr. Sherman\u2019s findings. She concluded that Neyland suffered from a personality disorder and not a mental illness and was competent to stand trial. At that time, defense counsel fully cross-examined Dr. Smith. Thus, defense counsel had \u201can opportunity and similar motive\u201d to cross-examine Dr. Smith during the competency hearing as to those matters she testified to during the mitigation proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-7\">{\u00b6 185} However, Neyland claims that defense counsel did not have a similar motive to cross-examine Dr. Smith about Dr. Sherman\u2019s findings regarding the R.C. 2929.04(B)(3) mitigating factor. Neyland cites <em>State v. Vrabel, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 184, 2003-Ohio-3193, 790 N.E.2d 303, \u00b6 87 (Moyer, C.J., dissenting), in arguing that the standard for an insanity defense and the standard for the R.C. 2929.04(B)(3) mitigating factor are not synonymous. But in <em>State v. Cooey, </em>46 Ohio St.3d 20, 33, 544 N.E.2d 895 (1989), the court held that a psychological report on sanity is relevant to the existence of the R.C. 2929.04(B)(3) mitigating factor, stating, \u201cThe issues involved are similar: whether a \u2018mental disease or defect\u2019 existed and, if so, whether and to what degree it may have impaired [the defendant\u2019s] cognition and volition.\u201d <em>See State v. Evans, </em>63 Ohio St.3d 231, 244, 586 N.E.2d 1042 (1992) (\u201cthe results of a competency evaluation would also be relevant to mitigation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-8\">{\u00b6 186} Defense counsel was motivated at the mitigation hearing by issues similar to those at the competency hearing. <em>See United States v. Salerno, </em>505 U.S. 317, 326, 112 S.Ct. 2503, 120 L.Ed.2d 255 (1992) (Blackmun, J., concurring) (\u201cBecause \u2018similar motive\u2019 does not mean \u2018identical motive,\u2019 the similar-motive inquiry * * * is inherently a <em>factual </em>inquiry, depending in part on the similarity of the underlying issues and on the context of the [prior] questioning\u201d [emphasis sic] ).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b494-9\">The requirement has become, not a mechanical one of identity or even of substantial identity of issues, but rather that the issues in the first <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>proceeding, and hence the purpose for which the testimony was offered, must have been such as to produce an adequate motive for testing on cross-examination the credibility of the testimony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">McCormick, <em>Evidence, </em>Section 304, at 495 (7th Ed.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-6\">{\u00b6 187} Dr. Smith\u2019s testimony that Neyland suffered from a personality disorder rather than a mental illness would have also been relevant in determining the existence of the R.C. 2929.03(B)(3) mitigating factor. Defense counsel would have had a similar motive in challenging this testimony during both the competency and the mitigation hearings. Thus, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that defense counsel had a prior opportunity to cross-examine Dr. Smith pursuant to Evid.R. 804(B)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-7\">{\u00b6 188} Based on the foregoing, proposition XIII is rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-8\">2. <em>Prosecutorial misconduct </em>(Proposition of law YI)</p>\n<p id=\"b495-9\">{\u00b6 189} Neyland argues that the prosecutor committed misconduct during the penalty-phase opening statement and closing argument. However, except where noted, Neyland failed to object to the prosecutor\u2019s comments and thus waived all but plain error. <em>See State v. Wade, </em>53 Ohio St.2d 182, 373 N.E.2d 1244 (1978), paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-10\">{\u00b6 190} First, Neyland argues that the prosecutor committed misconduct during the penalty-phase opening statement by stating, \u201cI submit to you that the heinous crime of purposely killing Doug Smith and Tomm Lazar will outweigh any mitigating factors that you will hear today beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d Neyland argues that the prosecutor\u2019s statement that this was a \u201cheinous crime\u201d was an improper comment on the nature and circumstances of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-11\">{\u00b6 191} The prosecutor\u2019s assertion that this was a \u201cheinous crime\u201d was a fair and permissible comment upon the nature and circumstances of the offenses. <em>See State v. Beuke, </em>38 Ohio St.3d 29, 32, 526 N.E.2d 274 (1988) (prosecutor\u2019s description of defendant\u2019s course of conduct as \u201chorrible,\u201d \u201ctreacherous,\u201d and \u201cvicious\u201d and a \u201cHollywood murder\u201d was permissible comment upon the nature and circumstances of the offenses). Moreover, the trial court in this case instructed the jury at the beginning of the penalty phase, \u201cWe are now to the opening statements of counsel. And, again, I caution you that these are statements of counsel and are not evidence.\u201d It is presumed that the jury followed the instructions of the judge. <em>State v. Jones, </em>135 Ohio St.3d 10, 2012-Ohio-5677, 984 N.E.2d 948, \u00b6 205. No plain error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b495-12\">{\u00b6 192} Second, Neyland argues that the prosecutor misstated the law during the penalty-phase closing argument by stating, \u201cNow, the defendant spoke to you about the scales of justice remaining balanced. He spoke to you about the scales <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>remaining balanced. However, that cannot happen in this case because the defendant purposely \u2014 .\u201d At this point, the defense objected. The objection was overruled, and the prosecutor continued: \u201cAgain, when the defendant spoke to you about the scales of justice, they cannot remain balanced in this case because the defendant purposely killed two people, Tomm Lazar and Doug Smith.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b496-4\">{\u00b6 193} Neyland argues that the prosecutor misstated the law because, if the aggravating circumstances and the mitigating factors were of equal weight, a life sentence must be imposed. <em>See State v. Greer, </em>39 Ohio St.3d 236, 251, 530 N.E.2d 382 (1988) (\u201cIf aggravation and mitigation are in equipoise, the jury must recommend a sentence of life imprisonment\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">{\u00b6 194} The prosecutor was not arguing that the jury could impose a death sentence if the aggravating circumstances and mitigating factors were balanced. Rather, the prosecutor was responding to a theme from Neyland\u2019s unsworn statement. Neyland said, \u201cIn order for the scales of justice to remain balanced, all [of the] Court\u2019s findings, in parenthesis, decisions, must be based on the rule of law * * Neyland later repeated, \u201cIn order for the scales of justice to remain balanced, it is not the Court\u2019s responsibility to tell the prosecutor or defense how to present the case, examining witnesses or cross-examine witnesses.\u201d Thus, Neyland\u2019s claim that the prosecutor\u2019s argument misstated the law by saying that the death sentence may be imposed when the aggravating circumstances and mitigating factors are in equipoise is incorrect.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">{\u00b6 195} We also reject Neyland\u2019s claim that the trial court erred by not giving a curative instruction, because such an instruction was unnecessary. Moreover, the trial court later instructed the jury, \u201cIf the weight of the aggravating circumstance and mitigating factors are equal, then you must proceed to consider the life sentence alternatives.\u201d Again, it is presumed that the jury followed the court\u2019s instructions. <em>State v. Diar, </em>120 Ohio St.3d 460, 2008-Ohio-6266, 900 N.E.2d 565, \u00b6 145. These instructions eliminated any possible confusion about equipoise.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">{\u00b6 196} Neyland also argues that the prosecutor\u2019s argument improperly commented on the nature and circumstances of the offense. We have held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-8\">Although * * * prosecutors cannot argue that the nature and circumstances of an offense are aggravating circumstances, the facts and circumstances of the offense must be examined to determine whether they are mitigating. R.C. 2929.04(B). Thus, a prosecutor may legitimately refer to the nature and circumstances of the offense, both to refute any suggestion that they are mitigating and to explain why the specified aggravating circumstance[s] outweigh mitigating factors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number><em>State v. Sheppard, </em>84 Ohio St.3d 230, 238, 703 N.E.2d 286 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">{\u00b6 197} The prosecutor\u2019s argument that Neyland purposely killed Lazar and Smith was proper. It simply described what the defendant did in committing the course-of-conduct aggravating circumstance.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">{\u00b6 198} Finally, Neyland argues that the prosecutor encouraged the jury to \u201cstack\u201d the aggravating circumstances during rebuttal arguments by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b497-8\">The Court will tell you that it is not the quantity of the evidence presented to you but in fact the quality of the evidence presented. In weighing the factors, consider that it\u2019s the defendant\u2019s choice in how he acted and reacts to certain situations. The defendant made the choice to fire eight times at Tomm Lazar and then walked immediately to his truck to go up the stairs, shoot Doug Smith in the face after yelling at him[,] \u201cCrawl, bitch, crawl.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">{\u00b6 199} \u201c[T]he jury is obligated to separately consider each count and separately weigh the aggravating circumstance or circumstances applicable to each count against any mitigating factors.\u201d <em>State v. Keith, </em>79 Ohio St.3d 514, 532, 684 N.E.2d 47 (1997). The prosecutor was entitled to argue that Neyland shot and killed Lazar and Smith, because Neyland had been convicted of the course-of-conduct aggravating circumstance for each killing. The prosecutor\u2019s argument did not improperly aggregate the aggravating circumstances. No plain error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-10\">{\u00b6 200} Neyland also argues that the prosecutor\u2019s rebuttal argument that the \u201cdefendant made the choice\u201d to shoot the victims treated the nature and circumstances of the offense as aggravating circumstances. However, defense counsel opened the door to the prosecutor\u2019s rebuttal. This argument responded to defense arguments that \u201cbecause of a mental disease or defect, Calvin lacked substantial capacity to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.\u201d Both parties have latitude in responding to arguments of opposing counsel. <em>State v. Loza, </em>71 Ohio St.3d 61, 78, 641 N.E.2d 1082 (1994). Thus, the prosecutor\u2019s rebuttal represented fair comment, and no plain error occurred. <em>See State v. Powell, </em>132 Ohio St.3d 233, 2012-Ohio-2577, 971 N.E.2d 865, \u00b6 182.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-11\">{\u00b6 201} Neyland also argues that the prosecutor\u2019s argument consisted of improper victim-impact evidence. But Neyland fails to explain how the prosecutor\u2019s argument that summarized Neyland\u2019s actions in shooting Lazar and Smith was improper. Again, no plain error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-12\">{\u00b6 202} Based on the foregoing, we overrule proposition VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>3. <em>Instructions </em>(Proposition of law IX)</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">{\u00b6 203} Neyland argues that the penalty-phase instructions contain various errors and that those errors necessitate a new penalty-phase hearing. However, defense counsel failed to object to these instructions and waived all but plain error. <em>State v. Underwood, </em>3 Ohio St.3d 12, 444 N.E.2d 1332 (1983), syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-6\">{\u00b6 204} First, Neyland claims that the trial court should have instructed the jury that the state had to prove that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. We reject this argument because the trial court did so instruct the jury, and its instructions on the burden of proof followed the language in R.C. 2929.03(D)(1) and (D)(2). <em>See State v. Frazier, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 139, 2007-Ohio-5048, 873 N.E.2d 1263, \u00b6 192.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">{\u00b6 205} Second, Neyland argues that the trial court erred in listing the mitigating factors in the alternative, because this had the effect of limiting the jury\u2019s consideration to only one of the mitigating factors rather than all of the mitigating factors or a combination of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">{\u00b6 206} The trial court provided the jury with the following instructions on considering the mitigating factors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-9\">Mitigating factors are factors about an individual or an offense that weigh in favor of a decision that a life sentence rather than a death sentence is appropriate. Mitigating factors are factors that diminish the appropriateness of a death sentence. <em>You must consider all of the mitigating factors presented to you. Mitigating factors include, but are not limited to, </em>the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history, character and background of the defendant; and, A, whether at the time of committing the offense the defendant, because of a mental disease or defect, lacked substantial capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law; or, B, the defendant\u2019s lack of a significant history of prior criminal convictions and delinquency adjudications; or, C, any other factors that weigh in favor of a sentence other than death. <em>This means you are not limited to the specific mitigating factors that have been described to you. You should consider any other mitigating factors that weigh in favor of a sentence other than death.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b498-11\">{\u00b6 207} The trial court\u2019s instructions clearly informed the jury that they must consider all the mitigating factors that were presented to them. Thus, we reject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>Neyland\u2019s claim that these instructions limited the jury\u2019s consideration to only one of the mitigating factors and hold that no plain error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">{\u00b6 208} Third, Neyland cites <em>State v. Awkal, </em>76 Ohio St.3d 324, 667 N.E.2d 960 (1996), in arguing that the trial court failed to instruct the jury that if they did not find that the R.C. 2929.04(B)(3) statutory factor applied, the jury should still consider such evidence under the \u201ccatch-all\u201d R.C. 2929.04(B)(7) mitigating factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">{\u00b6 209} In <em>Awkal, </em>the defendant argued that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that it could consider Awkal\u2019s psychological evidence mitigating <em>only if </em>Awkal established that he lacked substantial capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law. <em>Id. </em>at 334. In <em>Awkal, </em>the court expressly instructed the jury that it was not limited to the statutory mitigating factors in conducting the weighing process. <em>Id. </em>at 335. However, <em>Awkal </em>held that the trial court erred by failing to instruct the jury that \u201cit could use the psychological evidence for any purpose other than establishing the statutory mitigating factor in R.C. 2929.04(B)(3).\u201d <em>Id. Awkal </em>stated that the jury should have been instructed that \u201ceven if the jury determined that this mitigating factor was not established, it could view appellant\u2019s psychological evidence as mitigating under R.C. 2929.04(B)(7).\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">{\u00b6 210} The trial court did not specifically instruct Neyland\u2019s jury that if they did not find that Neyland\u2019s psychological or psychiatric evidence qualified under R.C. 2929.04(B)(3), such evidence should still be considered under R.C. 2929.04(B)(7). However, the trial court emphasized, \u201cYou must consider all of the mitigating factors presented to you. * * * This means you are not limited to the specific mitigating factors that have been described to you. You should consider any other mitigating factors that weigh in favor of a sentence other than death.\u201d Thus, <em>Awkal </em>is inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">{\u00b6 211} In <em>State v. Skatzes, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 195, 2004-Ohio-6391, 819 N.E.2d 215, \u00b6 172, we rejected a defense claim that the trial court erred in failing to instruct on all mitigating factors raised by the defense. <em>Skatzes </em>noted that the court did instruct the jury that it could consider \u201c \u2018any other factors that are relevant to the issue of whether the offender should be sentenced to death.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. Skatzes </em>held that the trial court did not err in failing to tailor its instructions more to the evidence. <em>Id. </em>The instructions in <em>Skatzes </em>and the present case were similarly worded. Thus, we conclude that the instructions on the consideration of mitigating evidence were not deficient and hold that no plain error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">{\u00b6 212} Finally, Neyland claims that the trial court improperly allowed the jury to determine which trial-phase evidence was relevant to the aggravating circumstance during the penalty phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>{\u00b6 213} During the penalty-phase instructions, the trial court advised the jurors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-5\">Some of the evidence and testimony that you considered in the trial phase of this case may not be considered in this sentencing phase. For purposes of this proceeding, only that evidence admitted in the trial phase that is relevant to the aggravating circumstance and to any of the mitigating factors is to be considered by you. You will also consider all of the evidence admitted during the sentencing phase together with the defendant\u2019s own statement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">{\u00b6 214} It is the trial court\u2019s responsibility to determine what trial-phase evidence is relevant in the penalty phase. <em>See State v. Getsy, </em>84 Ohio St.3d 180, 201, 702 N.E.2d 866 (1998). Here, the trial court\u2019s instructions on relevancy limited the jury\u2019s consideration of the trial-phase evidence and testimony to the aggravating circumstance and the mitigating factors. The trial court\u2019s instructions also made it clear that the jury would see only those trial-phase exhibits that the trial court admitted and deemed relevant. Viewing the penalty-phase instructions as a whole, we conclude that the trial court\u2019s instructions adequately informed the jury as to the evidence to consider during the penalty phase. <em>See State v. Lang, </em>129 Ohio St.3d 512, 2011-Ohio-4215, 954 N.E.2d 596, at \u00b6 251. No plain error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">{\u00b6 215} Based on the foregoing, we overrule proposition IX.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">4. <em>Sentencing opinion </em>(Proposition of law IV)</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">{\u00b6 216} Neyland argues that the trial court\u2019s sentencing opinion is flawed in reaching the conclusion that the aggravating circumstance outweighed the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-10\">{\u00b6 217} R.C. 2929.03(F) sets forth the findings a trial court must make when imposing a death sentence. The statute requires that the court shall state, in a separate opinion,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b500-11\">its specific findings as to the existence of any of the mitigating factors set forth in division (B) of section 2929.04 of the Revised Code, the existence of any other mitigating factors, the aggravating circumstances the offender was found guilty of committing, and the reasons why the aggravating circumstances the offender was found guilty of committing were sufficient to outweigh the mitigating factors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>{\u00b6 218} First, Neyland argues that the trial court failed to give decisive weight to testimony that he suffers from severe mental problems in concluding that the aggravating circumstance outweighed the mitigating factors. However, the \u201cassessment and weight to be given mitigating evidence are matters for the trial court\u2019s determination.\u201d <em>State v. Lott, </em>51 Ohio St.3d 160, 171, 555 N.E.2d 293 (1990). Moreover, the fact that mitigation evidence is admissible \u201cdoes not automatically mean that it must be given any weight.\u201d <em>State v. Steffen, </em>31 Ohio St.3d 111, 509 N.E.2d 383 (1987), paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-4\">{\u00b6 219} The trial court reviewed the testimony of Dr. Sherman and the state\u2019s three experts about Neyland\u2019s mental problems. The trial court concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-5\">Considering all of the expert testimonies, the Court finds, as the three State\u2019s experts have opined, that defendant has a personality disorder which does not rise to the level of a \u201cmental disease or defect\u201d that prevented defendant from appreciating the criminality of his conduct. Defendant\u2019s personality disorder falls under the \u201ccatch-all\u201d statutory provision and the Court accords it modest weight.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Here, the trial court considered the evidence presented about Neyland\u2019s mental problems before giving it \u201cmodest weight.\u201d The trial court could assign any or no weight to such evidence. <em>See State v. Hanna, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 285, 2002-Ohio-2221, 767 N.E.2d 678, \u00b6 103. Thus, no error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">{\u00b6 220} Second, Neyland argues that the trial court failed to consider whether the nature and circumstances of the offense were mitigating. Neyland claims that the testimony established that the killings of Smith and Lazar reflected his paranoia, psychotic condition, and bizarre behavior, which were entitled to some weight in mitigation. R.C. 2929.04(B) provides that the court, in determining whether death is an appropriate penalty, \u201cshall consider, and weigh against the aggravating circumstances proved beyond a reasonable doubt, the nature and circumstances of the offense.\u201d Thus, the trial court was required to review these factors. <em>See Lang, </em>129 Ohio St.3d 512, 2011-Ohio-4215, 954 N.E.2d 596, at \u00b6 301.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">{\u00b6 221} Nothing in the sentencing opinion shows that the trial court considered whether the nature and circumstances of the offense might be mitigating. But \u201c[w]hile a sentencing court must consider all evidence of mitigation, it need not discuss each factor individually.\u201d <em>State v. Phillips, </em>74 Ohio St.3d 72, 102, 656 N.E.2d 643 (1995), citing <em>Parker v. Dugger, </em>498 U.S. 308, 314-315, 111 S.Ct. 731, 112 L.Ed.2d 812 (1991). We hold that the trial court\u2019s failure to discuss whether the nature and circumstances of the offense might be mitigating was not erroneous. In any event, our independent review of the sentence will cure any flaws in the trial court\u2019s opinion. <em>See Lang </em>at \u00b6 298.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>{\u00b6 222} As a final matter, the state concedes that the trial court failed to provide specific reasons for finding that the aggravating circumstance outweighed the mitigating factors. But the state argues that such errors can be cured during our independent review of the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">{\u00b6 223} The trial court set forth the R.C. 2929.04(A)(5) aggravating circumstance that Neyland was found guilty of committing. The court also summarized the evidence that established Neyland\u2019s guilt of the offenses charged. The court then listed the mitigation evidence that it found Neyland was able to establish: \u201clack of significant criminal history, personality disorder, relatively successful and long employment history, and good behavior while in detention awaiting trial.\u201d The trial court then concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-6\">They [the mitigating factors] pale in comparison to the aggravating circumstance in this case and are only entitled to modest weight. The purposeful lulling [of] two or more persons is a grave aggravating circumstance of a very serious weight.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b502-7\">{\u00b6224} The trial court\u2019s sentencing opinion did not clearly explain why the aggravating circumstance in each count outweighed the mitigating factors. Yet the trial court\u2019s reasoning implicitly concluded that the aggravating circumstance as to each count, which was proved beyond a reasonable doubt, clearly outweighed the mitigating evidence that was presented. Our independent assessment of the evidence will purge any additional deficiency in the trial court\u2019s reasoning. <em>See State v. Dixon, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 328, 2004-Ohio-1585, 805 N.E.2d 1042, \u00b6 96-97.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-8\">{\u00b6 225} Based on the foregoing, we overrule proposition TV.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">C. <em>Ineffective assistance of counsel</em></p>\n<p id=\"b502-10\">{\u00b6 226} In propositions of law V and XIX, Neyland raises various claims that his counsel provided ineffective assistance during both phases of the trial. As previously noted, reversal of a conviction or sentence based on ineffective assistance requires finding both deficient performance and prejudice. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687,104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-11\">1. <em>Failure to rehabilitate prospective jurors</em></p>\n<p id=\"b502-12\">{\u00b6 227} Neyland asserts that trial counsel were ineffective by failing to ask follow-up questions of prospective jurors Nos. 81, 87, and 91, who indicated that they could not impose the death penalty.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-13\">{\u00b6 228} We have consistently declined to \u201csecond-guess trial strategy decisions\u201d or impose \u201chindsight views about how current counsel might have voir <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>dired the jury differently.\u201d <em>State v. Mason, </em>82 Ohio St.3d 144, 157, 694 N.E.2d 932 (1998). \u201c \u2018Few decisions at trial are as subjective or prone to individual attorney strategy as juror <em>voir dire, </em>where decisions are often made on the basis of intangible factors.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Mundt, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 22, 2007-Ohio-4836, 873 N.E.2d 828, \u00b6 64, quoting <em>Miller v. Francis, </em>269 F.3d 609, 620 (6th Cir.2001). Moreover, \u201ccounsel is in the best position to determine whether any potential juror should be questioned and to what extent.\u201d <em>State v. Murphy, </em>91 Ohio St.3d 516, 539, 747 N.E.2d 765 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">{\u00b6 229} Juror No. 81 expressed strong views against the death penalty. On the jury questionnaire, juror No. 81 stated that she would be unable to follow instructions and \u201cto consider fairly the imposition of a sentence of death.\u201d Juror No. 87 was opposed to the death penalty for religious reasons and believed that there were no circumstances in which the death penalty would be appropriate. We conclude that trial counsel were not deficient by failing to ask follow-up questions of these jurors after they expressed intractable views opposing the death penalty. <em>Powell, </em>132 Ohio St.3d 233, 2012-Ohio-2577, 971 N.E.2d 865, at \u00b6 200.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">{\u00b6 230} Juror No. 91 stated that he was against the death penalty \u201cin most cases.\u201d Juror No. 91 did not rule out voting for the death penalty in all situations and said, \u201cI can follow instructions.\u201d But juror No. 91 stated, \u201cI would probably vote against [the death penalty],\u201d when asked whether his beliefs would substantially impair his ability to follow the court\u2019s instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">{\u00b6 231} Trial counsel\u2019s decision not to question juror No. 91 was an exercise in discretionary judgment. <em>See State v. Goodwin, </em>84 Ohio St.3d 331, 335, 703 N.E.2d 1251 (1999). Even assuming trial counsel were deficient, any \u201cclaim of prejudice is necessarily speculative, because we cannot know whether [this juror] <em>could </em>have been rehabilitated.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>State v. Hale, </em>119 Ohio St.3d 118, 2008-Ohio-3426, 892 N.E.2d 864, \u00b6 213. Thus, this ineffectiveness claim lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">2. <em>Failure to object to excusal for cause</em></p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">{\u00b6 232} Neyland argues that trial counsel were ineffective by failing to object to the trial court\u2019s excusal for cause of prospective juror No. 24, because that juror stated that she could vote to impose the death penalty even though she expressed reluctance to provide a blanket \u201cyes\u201d to cover all contingencies. But the record shows that trial counsel did object to the excusal of juror No. 24. We reject this ineffectiveness claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">3. <em>Failure to prepare for mitigation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">{\u00b6 233} Neyland argues that his counsel were ineffective by failing to independently investigate his background or conduct any mitigation investigation. Ney<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>land asserts that his counsel\u2019s only attempt at mitigation was to \u201crecycle Dr. Sherman\u2019s testimony from the competency hearing\u201d and request a presentence investigation (\u201cPSI\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">{\u00b6 234} An attorney\u2019s failure to reasonably investigate the defendant\u2019s background and present mitigating evidence to the jury at sentencing can constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>Wiggins v. Smith, </em>539 U.S. 510, 521-522, 123 S.Ct. 2527, 156 L.Ed.2d 471 (2003). \u201cDefense counsel has a duty to investigate the circumstances of his client\u2019s case and explore all matters relevant to the merits of the case and the penalty, including the defendant\u2019s background, education, employment record, mental and emotional stability and family relationships.\u201d <em>Goodwin v. Johnson, </em>632 F.3d 301, 318 (6th Cir.2011). However, Neyland has the burden of demonstrating that his counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to conduct an adequate investigation. <em>State v. Hunter, </em>131 Ohio St.3d 67, 2011-Ohio-6524, 960 N.E.2d 955, \u00b6 104, citing <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">a <em>Background</em></p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">{\u00b6 235} Beginning on December 11, 2007 (more than ten months before trial), defense counsel informed the trial court that they wanted to \u201cstart preparing almost immediately\u201d for mitigation. Counsel hired Kelly Heiby, a mitigation expert, Dr. Wayne J. Graves, a psychologist, and Beth Ann Crum, a defense investigator, to assist counsel in preparing for mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-8\">{\u00b6 236} During a pretrial hearing on July 28, 2008, defense counsel informed the trial court that Neyland \u201crefused to cooperate in any preparation\u201d for mitigation. Neyland refused to meet with either Dr. Graves or Heiby. However, defense counsel said that they would continue trying to convince Neyland to cooperate with them. During a pretrial hearing on August 5, 2008, counsel notified the trial court that Neyland still refused to cooperate in preparing for mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-9\">{\u00b6 237} During a pretrial hearing on August 25, 2008, defense counsel told the court that Neyland refused to sign any releases to allow the defense to obtain any of his education, employment, military, medical, or court records. Counsel asked the trial court to order that these records be released to them. The trial court granted the defense request except for Neyland\u2019s juvenile-court records.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-10\">{\u00b6 238} On September 19, 2008, defense counsel filed a motion requesting the court to reconsider its finding that Neyland was competent. The defense motion was based, in part, on Neyland\u2019s refusal to cooperate with Dr. Graves and Heiby in preparing for mitigation. The motion included a letter from Heiby, stating, \u201c[Neyland] gave me no viable information to assist me in doing a proper mitigation investigation.\u201d The motion also included Dr. Graves\u2019s affidavit stating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>that Neyland \u201cexpressed an absolute refusal to cooperate in any type of preparation of mitigation for trial\u201d and \u201crefused to cooperate in any psychological testing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b505-6\">{\u00b6239} Following the state\u2019s presentation of trial-phase evidence, defense counsel stated that Neyland continued to refuse to cooperate in preparing for mitigation. Consequently, his counsel requested a PSI in the event that the jury found Neyland guilty of any of the capital specifications. Defense counsel expressed uncertainty about whether Neyland would cooperate in completing the PSI. But Adrian Cimerman, lead defense counsel, told the court that he and assistant defense counsel \u201care in possession of other information that we could pass on to the probation department in terms of employment history, family members who might be contacted for family background, [and] school records.\u201d {\u00b6240} During mitigation, the defense presented Dr. Sherman\u2019s testimony, Neyland made two unsworn statements, and the PSI was presented for the jury\u2019s consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-7\">b. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b505-8\">{\u00b6 241} Nothing in the record shows that defense counsel did not conduct an adequate investigation. Counsel obtained a mitigation specialist, a psychologist, and a defense investigator. Billing records show that Heiby spent numerous hours conducting her investigation between July 17 and October 22, 2008. The record does not show the full extent of the defense investigation into mitigation, but the court \u201ccannot infer a defense failure to investigate from a silent record.\u201d <em>Were, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 448,2008-Ohio-2762, 890 N.E.2d 263, at \u00b6 244.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-9\">(1) Neyland\u2019s refusal to cooperate</p>\n<p id=\"b505-10\">{\u00b6 242} Neyland\u2019s refusal to cooperate with defense experts in preparing for mitigation thwarted defense efforts to obtain information that could be used on his behalf during mitigation. The state argues that Neyland\u2019s ineffectiveness claim should be rejected based on the invited-error doctrine, because his refusal to cooperate with counsel in preparing mitigation caused the error that he now asserts.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-11\">{\u00b6 243} Under the invited-error doctrine, a party is not entitled to take advantage of an error that he himself invited or induced <em>the trial court </em>to make. <em>State ex rel. Kline v. Carroll, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 404, 2002-Ohio-4849, 775 N.E.2d 517, \u00b6 27. Neyland\u2019s ineffectiveness claim is not trying to take advantage of an error that he induced the trial court to make. Thus, the invited-error doctrine does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b505-12\">{\u00b6 244} Nonetheless, Neyland\u2019s lack of cooperation in preparing for mitigation is an important factor in reviewing whether counsel was deficient. To determine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>whether counsel\u2019s performance was deficient, the court must measure it against an objective standard based on accepted professional norms. <em>See Rompilla v. Beard, </em>545 U.S. 374, 380, 125 S.Ct. 2456, 162 L.Ed.2d 360 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b506-4\">{\u00b6 245} As a starting point, neither <em>Wiggins </em>nor <em>Strickland </em>addresses a situation where a defendant interferes with counsel\u2019s efforts to present mitigating evidence to a sentencing court. In <em>Rompilla, </em>the defendant refused to assist counsel in the development of a mitigation case, <em>id. </em>at 381, but there is no indication that the defendant ever informed the court that he did not want mitigating evidence presented. The Supreme Court held that counsel was responsible for conducting a further investigation even though the defendant suggested that no mitigation was available. <em>Id. </em>at 381-389.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">{\u00b6 246} In <em>Schriro v. Landrigan, </em>550 U.S. 465, 127 S.Ct. 1933, 167 L.Ed.2d 836 (2007), the defendant actively obstructed counsel\u2019s investigation and outright refused to allow counsel to present any mitigating evidence. For example, the defendant explicitly instructed his mother and ex-wife not to testify. <em>Id. </em>at 469. Counsel tried to make a proffer of the witnesses\u2019 testimony, but the defendant repeatedly interrupted his presentation to the court to reiterate that he did not want mitigating evidence presented. <em>Id. </em>at 470. The Supreme Court held that the defendant\u2019s refusal to cooperate in the penalty phase rendered counsel\u2019s limited investigation and presentation of mitigating evidence reasonable under the circumstances. <em>Id. </em>at 475-477.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">{\u00b6 247} In <em>Owens v. Guida, </em>549 F.3d 399 (6th Cir.2008), the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit considered whether counsel\u2019s failure to investigate a capital defendant\u2019s background was deficient when the defendant would not cooperate. In <em>Owens, </em>the defendant would not cooperate with mental-health examiners, would not allow counsel to communicate with her family, and contrary to counsel\u2019s advice, would not take the stand herself. <em>Id. </em>at 406-407. The court held that any failure to develop mitigating evidence was the result of the defendant\u2019s actions and not deficient performance by her counsel. <em>Id. </em>at 412. The court stated, <em>\u201cA </em>defendant cannot be permitted to manufacture a winning [ineffective-assistance-of-counsel] claim by sabotaging her own defense, or else every defendant clever enough to thwart her own attorneys would be able to overturn her sentence on appeal.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">{\u00b6 248} Other courts have held that a defendant\u2019s lack of cooperation does not eliminate counsel\u2019s duty to investigate. <em>See Hamilton v. Ayers, </em>583 F.3d 1100, 1118 (9th Cir.2009); <em>Sonnier v. Quarterman, </em>476 F.3d 349, 358 (5th Cir.2007). Moreover, the ABA Guidelines for the Appointment and Performance of Defense Counsel in Death Penalty Cases (2003) provide, \u201cThe investigation regarding penalty should be conducted regardless of any statement by the client that evidence bearing upon penalty is not to be collected or presented.\u201d <em>Id., </em>Guideline <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>10.7(A)(2), at 76. <em>See Bobby v. Van Hook, </em>558 U.S. 4, 7, 130 S.Ct. 13, 175 L.Ed.2d 255 (2009) (ABA standards useful as \u201cguides\u201d to what reasonableness entails to the extent that they describe professional norms that prevailed when the representation took place).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\">{\u00b6 249} Neyland\u2019s refusal to cooperate appears to fall somewhere between <em>Rompilla </em>and <em>Landrigan. </em>Neyland refused to cooperate with the mitigation specialist and the defense psychologist in preparing mitigation. But Neyland never told the trial court that he did not want defense counsel to present mitigation. Neyland made two unsworn statements during the mitigation proceedings, which indicates that he did want to present some mitigation. We hold that Neyland\u2019s refusal to cooperate with the mitigation specialist and the defense psychologist did not excuse counsel from conducting a mitigation investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">(2) Mitigating information obtained</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">{\u00b6 250} Despite Neyland\u2019s lack of cooperation, the record shows that the defense was able to assemble and collect mitigating information. Trial counsel obtained a court order for Neyland\u2019s records after he refused to sign a release. Trial counsel also had ample information about Neyland\u2019s mental condition from the competency proceedings that could be used for mitigation purposes after Neyland refused to cooperate with Dr. Graves and would not undergo any further psychological testing. Indeed, Dr. Sherman testified during mitigation. The PSI also shows that a wealth of information was obtained about Neyland\u2019s family history, educational background, employment history, military service, and lack of a serious criminal record.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">{\u00b6 251} Finally, Neyland\u2019s generalized claim fails to specify any mitigating information that his counsel failed to obtain. Thus, we hold that Neyland has failed to establish that defense counsel performed inadequately in preparing for mitigation. <em>See Hunter, </em>131 Ohio St.3d 67, 2011-Ohio-6524, 960 N.E.2d 955, at \u00b6 71; <em>State v. Perez, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 122, 2009-Ohio-6179, 920 N.E.2d 104, \u00b6226.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">4. <em>Other ineffective-assistance allegations</em></p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">{\u00b6 252} Neyland raises other instances of alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. As discussed in other propositions of law, trial counsel did object to the trial court\u2019s order that Neyland wear a leg restraint, and counsel\u2019s failure to object to the second leg restraint was not prejudicial (proposition of law III). Counsel were also not ineffective by failing to file motions to suppress his statements to police and the evidence obtained from a search of his motel room (proposition of law VII).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-10\">{\u00b6 253} As to other alleged instances of ineffective assistance of counsel, even if we assume that counsel were deficient, no prejudice resulted. Neyland was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>prejudiced by counsel\u2019s failure to object to the prosecutor\u2019s opening statement and closing argument during the penalty phase (proposition of law VI), and he was also not prejudiced by counsel\u2019s failure to object to penalty-phase instructions (proposition of law IX). Neyland also objects to other alleged instances of substandard lawyering but fails to provide any specific examples in support of this allegation. We also reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">{\u00b6 254} Based on the foregoing, we overrule proposition V.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">5. <em>Failure to preserve the record</em></p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">{\u00b6 255} In proposition of law XIX, Neyland argues that his counsel were ineffective by faffing to make timely objections and preserve meritorious issues for appellate review. Yet Neyland does not cite any record references, any objections that counsel failed to make, or any meritorious issues that counsel failed to preserve. Thus, Neyland has failed to establish deficient performance or prejudice. <em>See Powell, </em>132 Ohio St.3d 233, 2012-Ohio-2577, 971 N.E.2d 865, at \u00b6 197. We reject proposition XIX.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">D. <em>Remaining issues</em></p>\n<p id=\"b508-9\">1. <em>Cumulative error </em>(Proposition of law XVIII)</p>\n<p id=\"b508-10\">{\u00b6 256} Neyland argues that cumulative errors committed during the trial deprived him of a fair trial and require a reversal of his convictions and death sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-11\">{\u00b6 257} <em>State v. DeMarco, </em>31 Ohio St.3d 191, 509 N.E.2d 1256 (1987), paragraph two of the syllabus, recognized the doctrine of cumulative error. Under this doctrine, a conviction will be reversed when the cumulative effect of errors in a trial deprives a defendant of a fair trial, even though each of the numerous errors does not individually constitute cause for reversal. <em>Id. </em>at 196-197. <em>See also Powell </em>at \u00b6 222-224; <em>State v. Garner, </em>74 Ohio St.3d 49, 64, 656 N.E.2d 623 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-12\">{\u00b6 258} The doctrine of cumulative error is not applicable in the present case. Neyland received a fair trial. Moreover, none of the errors committed in this case, when considered either individually or cumulatively, resulted in prejudicial error. As previously discussed in other propositions of law, overwhelming evidence was introduced that established Neyland\u2019s guilt. Proposition XVIII is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-13\">2. <em>Proportionality </em>(Proposition of law X)</p>\n<p id=\"b508-14\">{\u00b6 259} Neyland argues that Ohio\u2019s proportionality review is unconstitutional. He contends that a meaningful proportionality review must include cases resulting in life imprisonment after a capital-sentencing hearing, as well as those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>resulting in the imposition of the death penalty. However, we have consistently held that the proportionality review required by R.C. 2929.05(A) is satisfied by a review of cases in which the death penalty has been imposed. <em>See State v. Scott, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 31, 2004-Ohio-10, 800 N.E.2d 1133, \u00b6 51; <em>State v. LaMar, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 181, 2002-Ohio-2128, 767 N.E.2d 166, \u00b6 23; <em>Steffen, </em>31 Ohio St.3d 111, 509 N.E.2d 383, at paragraph one of the syllabus. Proposition X is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">3. <em>Constitutionality of death penalty </em>(Proposition of law XVII)</p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">{\u00b6 260} Neyland challenges the constitutionality of Ohio\u2019s death-penalty statutes. These claims can be rejected. <em>See State v. Fry, </em>125 Ohio St.3d 163, 2010-Ohio-1017, 926 N.E.2d 1239, \u00b6 215-216; <em>State v. Carter, </em>89 Ohio St.3d 593, 607, 734 N.E.2d 345 (2000); <em>State v. Jenkins, </em>15 Ohio St.3d 164, 473 N.E.2d 264 (1984), paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">{\u00b6 261} In addition, Neyland claims that Ohio\u2019s death-penalty statutes violate international law and treaties to which the United States is a party. This argument also lacks merit. <em>See State v. Issa, </em>93 Ohio St.3d 49, 69, 752 N.E.2d 904 (2001); <em>Phillips, </em>74 Ohio St.3d at 103-104, 656 N.E.2d 643.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">4. <em>Lethal injection </em>(Proposition of law VIII)</p>\n<p id=\"b509-10\">{\u00b6 262} Neyland challenges the constitutionality of lethal injection. However, this court has previously rejected similar claims. <em>See Adams, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 508, 2004-Ohio-5845, 817 N.E.2d 29, at \u00b6 131; <em>Carter </em>at 608.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-11\">5. <em>Appropriateness of death sentence </em>(Proposition XVI)</p>\n<p id=\"b509-12\">{\u00b6 263} Neyland argues that the death penalty is not appropriate because of evidence of his mental condition and/or mental illness. We shall consider these arguments during our independent sentence evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-13\">IV. Independent Sentence Evaluation</p>\n<p id=\"b509-14\">{\u00b6 264} Having considered Neyland\u2019s propositions of law, this court must now independently review Neyland\u2019s death sentence for appropriateness and proportionality and independently determine whether the aggravating circumstance of which Neyland was convicted outweighs the mitigating factors pursuant to R.C. 2929.05(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-15\">A. <em>Aggravating circumstance</em></p>\n<p id=\"b509-16\">{\u00b6 265} Neyland was convicted of murdering Thomas Lazar and Douglas Smith as part of a course of conduct involving the purposeful killing of two or more persons in violation of R.C. 2929.04(A)(5). The evidence at trial supports the jury\u2019s finding of this aggravating circumstance.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>{\u00b6 266} The evidence established that Neyland arrived at Liberty Transportation to meet with Lazar and Smith about the termination of his employment. After arriving at Liberty, Neyland shot and killed Lazar in the parking-lot area and then went to Smith\u2019s office and killed him. Neyland fled to a Michigan motel, where he was later captured. A handgun found in Neyland\u2019s tractor was later identified as the murder weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">{\u00b6 267} Here, the killing of both victims was directly linked in time and location. <em>See State v. Sapp, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 104, 2004-Ohio-7008, 822 N.E.2d 1239, \u00b6 52 (time, location, and murder weapon can establish the factual link necessary to prove a course of conduct).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">{\u00b6 268} The evidence also establishes that Neyland\u2019s acts were purposeful. Neyland shot Lazar four times in the back and shot Smith in the head. Moreover, Neyland told another truck driver about a week before the murders, \u201cIf they mess with me, I\u2019ll just shoot them.\u201d The 9-1-1 tape also captured Neyland telling Smith to \u201ccrawl bitch\u201d before killing him. Finally, the coroner\u2019s testimony established that three of the gunshot wounds on Lazar\u2019s back were in close proximity and displayed a triangular pattern. Following Neyland\u2019s arrest, pieces of paper that Neyland had left were found in his storage unit. One piece displayed three pennies arranged in a close triangular pattern that matched the gunshot pattern on Lazar\u2019s back. The paper contained the words, \u201cOOOO, I\u2019m so scared. Three Round Shot Group.\u201d There was also the statement, \u2018You think I\u2019m playing[.] You\u2019re going to come up missing!!!\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">B. <em>Mitigating evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">{\u00b6 269} Against this aggravating circumstance, this court must weigh the mitigating factors contained in R.C. 2929.04(B). Neyland called Dr. Thomas Sherman as a witness. Neyland also made an unsworn statement, a supplemental unsworn statement, and a statement in allocution. In addition, Neyland introduced a PSI and the record of his behavior in jail.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">{\u00b6 270} Dr. Sherman evaluated Neyland during the competency proceedings. Dr. Sherman testified that Neyland was paranoid. Dr. Sherman stated that it was very obvious in talking with Neyland that \u201cthe normal process of reason and logic weren\u2019t there.\u201d He stated that \u201cit was crystal clear to me that he had a mental illness, and I thought he was incompetent to stand trial.\u201d Dr. Sherman made two diagnoses: \u201cOne is a delusional disorder, a persecutory type. And the second is schizophrenia, a more severe form of that illness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b510-10\">{\u00b6 271} Dr. Sherman provided examples of Neyland\u2019s behavior that supported his findings. First, Neyland moved out of his house and into his truck because he believed that people were breaking into his house to listen to his answering machine. Second, Neyland mentioned that prophylactics were mysteriously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>showing up all the time in his laundry. Finally, Neyland placed notes in his storage unit saying, \u201cI\u2019m so scared\u201d and left other comments relating to the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">{\u00b6 272} Dr. Sherman testified that Neyland met the criteria for the R.C. 2929.03(B)(3) mitigating factor. Dr. Sherman stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-7\">[Neyland] was laboring under severe mental disease, mental illness. As I mentioned earlier, there is no way he could formulate conclusions in a normal way. As I indicated, all of this indicates to me he had a severe mental illness of a paranoid type, that he suspected virtually everybody of something, that probably would have not taken very much to tip him off. And I have no idea what exactly it was about his relationship with these two people, but the intensity of the reaction was compatible with all of the things I mentioned earlier. You don\u2019t do something like this because you\u2019ve got a grudge against two people.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">{\u00b6 273} The PSI included a variety of information about Neyland\u2019s background. Neyland was 43 years old at the time of the offenses. He has never been married and has no children. Neyland was born in Toledo and was one of ten siblings. Neyland\u2019s father was a minister and \u201cworked in the pathology field,\u201d and his mother was a registered nurse. Neyland\u2019s parents divorced when he was 14 years old. Neyland and his siblings remained in their mother\u2019s custody after the divorce.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-9\">{\u00b6 274} Neyland reported that his mother was strict, and Neyland\u2019s family life was heavily influenced by his mother\u2019s involvement in church. Neyland later went to live with an uncle and then lived with his father in Michigan. Neyland denied any familial history of mental illness and stated that neither of his parents had a chemical-dependency problem. Neyland\u2019s father died in 1997, and his mother died in 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-10\">{\u00b6 275} Neyland attended Toledo schools for most of his education. He graduated from Scott High School in June 1982. He ranked 182d out of a class of 246 students. His grade point average was 1.23 on a 4.00 scale.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-11\">{\u00b6 276} Neyland served in the Army from March 1987 to May 1988. Military records showed that he was charged with desertion and later received a discharge \u201cfor the good of the service.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b511-12\">{\u00b6 277} Neyland reported that he graduated from American Truck Driving School in 1988. Neyland has worked as a truck driver for numerous trucking companies. He was hired as a truck driver for'Liberty Transportation in July <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>2006. As a driver for Liberty, Neyland committed traffic violations and violated company policy on several occasions.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">{\u00b6 278} Neyland does not have a significant criminal record. He was convicted of bad-check offenses in 1987. Otherwise, Neyland\u2019s record shows a history of traffic violations for speeding and other minor driving offenses. Neyland denied using any illicit substances, but he has occasionally used alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">{\u00b6 279} A report from the Wood County Sheriffs Office was introduced and provided a daily account of Neyland\u2019s behavior while he was in jail awaiting trial. The report shows that Neyland followed procedures and behaved himself except for a couple of minor incidents. .</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">{\u00b6 280} In his unsworn statement, Neyland said that while he was jailed at the Wood County Justice Center, other inmates called him \u201cOsama Bin Ladin.\u201d Neyland is not a Muslim. He is a Christian, and his father pastored two churches.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">{\u00b6 281} Neyland is the third oldest of ten children. He was born and raised in Toledo. Neyland\u2019s father prepared tissue samples for examination by doctors and surgeons. His mother was a registered nurse. Neyland has never had any children. But he has had \u201ctwo paternity tests\u201d against him. A case from Kansas was dismissed in Ohio. Neyland wanted that placed into the record so that there would be no questions about any nonpayment of child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">{\u00b6 282} Neyland has worked as \u201ca driver for 20 years off and on.\u201d Before that, Neyland was in the military and worked with the military police.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-9\">{\u00b6 283} Neyland also stated, \u201cI\u2019m going to read into the record a statement * * * because I really do believe that the case was not presented in its full totality.\u201d Neyland said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-10\">In order for the scales of justice to remain balanced, all [of the] Court\u2019s findings, in parenthesis, decisions, must be based on the rule of law, not on motions, underlined, all cases are subject to judicial review. This is a murder trial. All evidence must be presented, the evidence that in all probability will convict the defendant and evidence that could possibly exonerate the defendant. Neither the prosecution nor the defense presented the evidence in its totality during these court proceedings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-11\">{\u00b6 284} Neyland then told the jury about court cases that he had been involved in so that \u201cyou would have some idea of what type of person I am.\u201d The first case was an action involving Ohio Job and Family Services, in which he was \u201cawarded $7,500 for the year of unemployment that I was previously denied.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>The second case occurred in Indiana, and he was awarded reimbursement of a week\u2019s wages that had been withheld from him.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">{\u00b6 285} Neyland presented a supplemental unsworn statement after Dr. Sherman testified. Neyland said that he wanted to question Dr. Sherman but the judge would not allow it. Neyland wanted Dr. Sherman to observe him while he made a statement to the court and then tell the court what he witnessed. Neyland disputed Dr. Sherman\u2019s findings:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-6\">First of all, a psychotic person does not have a train of thought. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aj7\">I made $175,000 in 12 months. I have tax forms to prove it. From July the 1st of 2006 to January or December 31st of 2006, I made $85,558. A psychotic person doesn\u2019t have that memory, wouldn\u2019t be able to remember the numbers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">{\u00b6 286} Neyland then provided examples of his work as a truck driver and mentioned the time and effort that were required to perform those jobs. He stated, \u201cI\u2019m trying to make a point that a psychotic person would not be able to accomplish that nor would they be able to remember it nor would they be able to plan that.\u201d Neyland also said: \u201cI was a trainer for Gunther\u2019s, which means I train other drivers. Trucking companies would not allow drivers to train other drivers if they\u2019re psychotic. It is a requirement by DOT that drivers never have at any time * * * mental illness. So from 1999 to 2008 I was a driver.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">{\u00b6 287} Neyland also disputed the sufficiency of the evidence of his guilt. He stated that Smith did not mention Neyland\u2019s name in making the 9-1-1 call. Neyland also said that his clothes did not have any blood spatters on them and were not tested for gunpowder residue. He also stated, \u201cThe jury was not presented with Douglas Smith\u2019s hands, with what seemed to be blond hair wrapped around his fingers. * * * I don\u2019t have blond hair. * * * I have an afro, I have curly hair.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">{\u00b6 288} The state called Dr. Bergman, Dr. Kristen Haskins, and Dr. Delaney Smith as rebuttal witnesses. These witnesses had also evaluated Neyland during the competency proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-10\">{\u00b6 289} Dr. Bergman, a psychologist, testified that Neyland was not suffering from a mental illness but had a severe personality disorder. Dr. Bergman stated that she could not determine whether Neyland lacked substantial capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct because Neyland would not talk to her about his criminal conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-11\">{\u00b6 290} Dr. Haskins, a psychologist, testified that Neyland had a \u201cmixed personality disorder.\u201d She stated, \u201c[H]e\u2019s capable of choosing his behaviors and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>actions and of making decisions. And there were no indications that those were tainted by any kind of severe mental illness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">{\u00b6 291} Dr. Smith, a psychiatrist, detected no signs of mental illness, but determined that Neyland had a paranoid personality disorder. Dr. Smith had reviewed Dr. Sherman\u2019s report and stated that she had \u201cmore time to observe and interact with Mr. Neyland and see him in various different settings and see his interactions with different people.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">{\u00b6 292} Before sentencing, Neyland made a statement in allocution. Neyland discussed his background. He had a paper route with the Toledo Blade and also worked as a crew chief for McDonald\u2019s when he was growing up. Neyland stated that he did \u201cnot [have] a lot friends, not a lot of girlfriends, no children.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">{\u00b6 293} Neyland said, \u201cAll the males in my family from the Civil War to World War II, [and] Korea\u201d served in the military. Neyland is a veteran and entered the military two weeks after graduating from high school. Neyland said, \u201cAll of the jobs that I\u2019ve ever had, and that includes military jobs, I was given responsibility.\u201d He continued, \u201cI\u2019ve always operated on my own, and I\u2019ve made my own decisions. And this is how my dad raised me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b514-7\">{\u00b6 294} Neyland discussed the offenses. He stated that he did not know Doug Smith personally and had never met Lazar. Neyland also said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-8\">I sat here and I watched the jurors during the whole proceedings. And I am not sure from observing them that they are aware of the total idea or the total realm, if you put everything together, what actually happened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-9\">I cannot say that I know what happened August the 8th. But I can tell you from facts that Douglas Smith and Tomm Lazar are not here to take responsibility for what they did prior to August the 8th and what led to August 8th.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-10\">* % *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b514-11\">Just watching the jury, they did not listen to the whole case. What did they come up with? Death. They cannot place me at Liberty Transportation at 7171 Reuthinger Road. The law enforcement in the State of Ohio did not see me. They did not see my tractor. Law enforcement in Michigan at the time of the phone call at 2:58 p.m., from 3 p.m. to 3:30 p.m., Chief Hines of Erie Township Police Department viewed or saw the truck with Officer Konopka. The jury did not hear that. They did not want to hear that. I don\u2019t have a time machine. I could not possibly be in two places at once.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>* * * I don\u2019t live my life in fear and I fear no man. But I will tell you what my dad told me. \u201cVengeance is mine sayeth the Lord, and that is the double-edged sword.\u201d That\u2019s all I have to say, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b515-4\">C. <em>Sentence evaluation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">{\u00b6 295} Nothing in the nature and circumstances of the offenses appears to be mitigating. Neyland shot and killed two officials at Liberty Transportation who were about to fire him. Neyland left notes in his storage unit before the shootings occurred that indicated his intent to carry out these offenses. These offenses establish horrific crimes that lack any mitigating features.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">{\u00b6 296} Neyland\u2019s character offers little in mitigation. His history and background also provide little mitigating value. Neyland grew up in a large family with supportive parents. He was a high school graduate and served in the Army. Neyland was also gainfully employed as a truck driver for many years and supported himself with a good income.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">{\u00b6 297} The statutory mitigating factors under R.C. 2929.04(B) include (B)(1) (victim inducement), (B)(2) (duress, coercion, or strong provocation), (B)(3) (mental disease or defect), (B)(4) (youth of the offender \u2014 Neyland was 43 at the time of the offense), (B)(5) (lack of a significant criminal record), (B)(6) (not the principal offender), and (B)(7) (any other relevant factors). The factors under (B)(1), (B)(2), (B)(4), and (B)(6) do not appear to apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">{\u00b6298} Dr. Sherman testified that the R.C. 2929.04(B)(3) mitigating factor applies. The (B)(3) factor applies when \u201cat the time of committing the offense, the offender, because of a mental disease or defect, lacked substantial capacity to appreciate the criminality of the offender\u2019s conduct or to conform the offender\u2019s conduct to the requirements of the law.\u201d But two psychologists and another psychiatrist testified that Neyland suffered from a personality disorder rather than a mental illness. A behavior or personality disorder does not qualify as a mental defect or disease. <em>See State v. Fox, </em>69 Ohio St.3d 183, 192, 631 N.E.2d 124 (1994); <em>State v. Richey, </em>64 Ohio St.3d 353, 372, 595 N.E.2d 915 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b515-9\">{\u00b6 299} In weighing their conflicting testimony about the applicability of the (B)(3) factor, we note that Dr. Sherman met with Neyland for approximately one hour in conducting his examination. In contrast, Dr. Haskins and Dr. Smith evaluated Neyland during a lengthy in-patient observation period. We conclude that the (B)(3) factor has not been established.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-10\">{\u00b6 300} However, we give significant weight to Neyland\u2019s personality disorders and other mental problems under the catch-all provision, R.C. 2929.04(B)(7). Undoubtedly, Neyland is paranoid. On several occasions, Neyland made bizarre comments that made little sense and exhibited other odd behavior during trial. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>Yet Dr. Haskins emphasized that Neyland was \u201ccapable of choosing his behaviors and actions and of making decisions. And there were no indications that those were tainted by any kind of severe mental illness.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">{\u00b6 301} We also give weight to the R.C. 2929.04(B)(5) mitigating factor, because Neyland does not have a significant criminal record.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">{\u00b6 302} In addition, we give weight to Neyland\u2019s employment history and his military service as (B)(7) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-7\">{\u00b6 303} Neyland claims that his good behavior in jail is a mitigating factor. Good behavior in jail is relevant to lack of future dangerousness: \u201c \u2018[T]he lack of a prison disciplinary record reveals nothing about a defendant\u2019s character except that the defendant can exist in the highly structured environment of a prison without endangering others.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mundt, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 22, 2007-Ohio-4836, 873 N.E.2d 828, at \u00b6 210, quoting <em>Franklin v. Lynaugh, </em>487 U.S. 164, 186, 108 S.Ct. 2320, 101 L.Ed.2d 155 (1988) (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring). Thus, we give weight to Neyland\u2019s good behavior while in pretrial confinement.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-8\">{\u00b6 304} Based upon our independent weighing of the evidence, we conclude that the aggravating circumstance as to each count outweighs all the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. Neyland\u2019s course of conduct in killing Lazar and Smith is a grave aggravating circumstance. Neyland\u2019s mitigating evidence pales in comparison. We also note that Neyland shows no remorse for what happened and does not accept responsibility for his actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-9\">{\u00b6 305} As a final matter, we find that the penalty imposed in this case is not \u201cexcessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar cases\u201d of murder as a course of conduct involving the purposeful killing of two or more persons. R.C. 2929.05(A). <em>See State v. Clemons, </em>82 Ohio St.3d 438, 696 N.E.2d 1009 (1998) (truck driver went to office of employer and murdered three co-workers); <em>State v. Davie, </em>80 Ohio St.3d 311, 686 N.E.2d 245 (1997) (former employee killed two former co-workers and attempted to kill a third).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-10\">V. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b516-11\">{\u00b6 306} We affirm the judgments of conviction and the sentence of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-12\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b516-13\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and O\u2019Donnell, Lanzinger, and French, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b516-14\">Pfeifer, J., concurs in part and dissents in part.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b516-15\">O\u2019Neill, J., dissents.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b490-9\">. The R.C. 2929.04(B)(3) statutory mitigating factor states, \u201cWhether, at the time of committing the offense, the offender, because of a mental disease or defect, lacked substantial capacity to appreciate the criminality of the offender\u2019s conduct or to conform the offender\u2019s conduct to the requirements of the law.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b493-12\">.

There is no reasonable doubt about whether Neyland committed the murders in this case. Based on my independent weighing of the aggravating factors and the mitigating factors, primarily his mental health at the time the murders were committed, I conclude that Neyland should not be put to death. I would vacate the sentence of death and remand to the trial court under R.C. 2929.06 for a resentencing hearing in which the death penalty is not an option.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b517-5\">O\u2019Neill, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AX8\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-6\">{\u00b6 308} Something is terribly wrong with Ohio\u2019s application of the death penalty, and it does not seem to be getting any better with the passage of time. In 1994, Wilford Berry Jr. \u2014 commonly known as \u201cthe Volunteer\u201d \u2014 began doing everything he could to speed up the implementation of his death sentence. Berry was convicted in 1990 of the aggravated murder of Charles Mitroff, and even then it was clear that Berry had struggled with mental illness all his life, including personality disorders. <em>State v. Berry, </em>72 Ohio St.3d 354, 650 N.E.2d 433 (1995). But Berry was found to be competent to waive his appeals, and on February 19, 1999, he was executed- \u2014 the first person executed in Ohio in over 30 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-7\">{\u00b6 309} Seven years later, despite Donald Ketterer\u2019s lifelong psychiatric problems (including bipolar disorder and personality disorders), this court concluded that he was competent to plead guilty to aggravated murder, and we affirmed his sentence of death. <em>State v. Ketterer, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 70, 2006-Ohio-5283, 855 N.E.2d 48. In a concurring opinion, two justices of this court expressed their belief that the state should \u201creexamine whether we, as a society, should administer the death penalty to a person with a serious mental illness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 213 (Lundberg Stratton, J., concurring, and Pfeifer, J., joining the concurrence). Thus far, no such reexamination has occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-8\">{\u00b6 310} I have previously stated that the death penalty is both cruel and unusual and cannot be morally justified by retribution or deterrence. <em>State v. Wogenstahl, </em>134 Ohio St.3d 1437, 2013-Ohio-164, 981 N.E.2d 900 (O\u2019Neill, J., dissenting). But the unconstitutionality and inhumanity of capital punishment are even clearer when it is imposed on the mentally ill, such as Calvin Neyland. It is plain that the families of Douglas Smith and Thomas Lazar have suffered tremendously at Neyland\u2019s hands, and they deserve to see Neyland punished. But I cannot support the proposition that it is a just punishment to take the life of a man whose delusions of persecution led him to commit the horrible acts for which he was convicted.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"ATC3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>Paul A. Dobson, Wood County Prosecuting Attorney, and Gwen Howe-Gebers and Heather M. Baker, Assistant Prosecuting Attorneys, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">{\u00b6 311} The majority has concluded that Neyland had not established the statutory mitigating factor under R.C. 2929.04(B)(3) that \u201cat the time of committing the offense, the offender, because of a mental disease or defect, lacked substantial capacity to * * * conform the offender\u2019s conduct to the requirements of the law.\u201d This conclusion is baffling. The experts who testified at Neyland\u2019s trial all agreed that Neyland suffered from significant mental problems that affected his behavior: Dr. Bergman concluded that Neyland had a severe personality disorder, Dr. Haskins concluded that Neyland had a mixed personality disorder, and Dr. Smith testified that Neyland had a paranoid personality disorder. And the defendant\u2019s expert, Dr. Sherman, diagnosed Neyland with \u201cdelusional disorder, a persecutory type\u201d and schizophrenia. Dr. Sherman concluded that Neyland, to a reasonable degree of scientific certainty, \u201cwas laboring under severe mental disease, mental illness * * * [and that] there is no way he could formulate conclusions in a normal way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">{\u00b6 312} Neyland\u2019s mental illness was apparent as far back as 1999, when he simply fell through the cracks in the system. At the time he killed Douglas Smith and Thomas Lazar, Neyland was living in his truck because he believed that people were breaking into his house to listen to the messages on his answering machine. As Dr. Sherman observed, at the time he committed the murders, Neyland suffered from \u201ca severe mental illness of a paranoid type, that he suspected virtually everybody of something, [and] that [it] probably would have not taken very much to tip him off.\u201d Neyland was and is very resistant to treatment, and this is most effectively demonstrated by his refusal to participate in developing a mitigation case. He then offered a statement in rebuttal to the diagnosis of his own defense expert, further evidencing his denial and delusions. A mentally competent person simply does not challenge the findings of a defense expert who has been hired with the sole objective of saving that person\u2019s life.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">{\u00b6 313} It is plain that Neyland is not now mentally fit and that he was suffering from mental defects at the time he committed his terrible acts. As former governor Michael DiSalle recognized in 1959 when he commuted the sentence of Lewis Niday, \u201c[s]urely society [does] not need to take the life of a mentally defective individual in order to protect itself.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Capital punishment in general is abhorrent, but executing the mentally ill is unconscionable.
