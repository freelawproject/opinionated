(\u201cEast Bank\u201d), appeals from a decision of the Board of Tax Appeals (\u201cBTA\u201d) reversing the property valuation of the Franklin County Board of Revision regarding 21 condominium units and reinstating the county auditor\u2019s valuation of those condominium units as requested by the countercomplaints filed by the Dublin City Schools Board of Education. Many of the 21 units remained unfinished to varying degrees as of the 2008 tax lien date. Specifically, we are concerned with whether the BTA properly utilized the auditor\u2019s valuation of the 21 units when the only evidence in the record appears to negate the auditor\u2019s determination. Because the property owner presented expert evidence of valuation and because the board of education failed to present any evidence, we reverse the determination of the BTA and establish the 2008 valuation in accordance with the property owner\u2019s evidence of $3,100,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-12\">Factual Background and Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b301-13\">{\u00b6 2} East Bank began construction of the East Bank II condominium complex in 2006. The business plan involved first completing the construction of the building\u2019s infrastructure and then completing each of its 28 condominium units to suit the buyer. According to East Bank, as of January 1, 2008, the tax hen date, three of the 28 units were completed and sold, four units were finished but unsold, and 21 units remained unsold and unfinished.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>{\u00b6 3} The Franklin County auditor assessed the true value of each parcel individually for the tax year 2008 and determined that the aggregate true value of the 21 units was $8,139,300. East Bank objected and filed complaints for each of the unfinished and unsold units, challenging the valuation of the property with the board of revision. Subsequently, the school board filed countercomplaints seeking to retain the auditor\u2019s valuation of the condominium units.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">{\u00b6 4} At the board of revision hearing, East Bank presented the testimony of East Bank managing partner George Babyak, as well as the appraisal report and testimony of Thomas Horner. Although an attorney representing the board of education appeared at the board of revision hearing and cross-examined Babyak, the board of education did not present any witnesses or additional information regarding the valuation of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">{\u00b6 5} Thus, the only evidence of value presented at the hearing came from Horner\u2019s appraisal and testimony. Using a \u201ccondominium analysis,\u201d Horner opined that the 21 units had a \u201cnet present market value\u201d or \u201cas-is value\u201d of $3,100,000. Horner testified that he considered the 21 units as a \u201csingle economic unit\u201d because they are \u201cowned by one owner\u201d and \u201c[tjhat owner can only sell all units at one time to one investor.\u201d He utilized a comparable sales analysis using condominium sales and marketing activity of East Bank I and East Bank II and then made reductions based on the estimated cost to finish the remaining units. This analysis yielded \u201cgross sale proceeds\u201d of $6,492,294. Considering the units to be a \u201csingle economic unit,\u201d Horner applied what he called a \u201cbulk discount\u201d to arrive at an estimated value of $3,100,000, which is approximately 48 percent of $6,492,294.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">{\u00b66} After its review, the board of revision accepted Horner\u2019s.valuation of $3,100,000 as the total fair market value for the 21 units, stating, \u201cWe were given no additional information on behalf of the county complainant school board in this matter, and * * * we recognize Mr. Horner as being an expert in the area of real estate appraisal.\u201d The school board then appealed the board of revision\u2019s decision to the BTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">{\u00b6 7} At the BTA hearing, East Bank once again presented Babyak and Horner as witnesses. At that time, Horner had additional data from condominium sales occurring in the four-year period after the tax lien date. He testified to a revised cash flow analysis using the actual historical sales, which included investor discounts for some units ranging from $75,000 to $105,800. Taking into account the various investor discounts and the construction costs to complete the units, he retrospectively concluded that the cash flow analysis resulted in a value of $2,900,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>{\u00b6 8} Although the board of education\u2019s attorney cross-examined Babyak and Horner during the BTA hearing, the school board did not present any witnesses, evidence of its own valuation, or evidence in support of the auditor\u2019s valuation.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">{\u00b6 9} After reviewing the evidence, the BTA concluded that East Bank \u201cfailed to present competent and probative evidence to either this board or the BOR in support of its requested decreases in value.\u201d <em>Dublin City Schools Bd. of Edn. v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>BTA Nos. 2009-Q-1282 through 2009-Q-1301 and 2009-Q-1408, 2012 WL 3166815, *6 (July 24, 2012). Specifically, the BTA found that Horner\u2019s use of the bulk discount was improper under <em>MU Homes of Cincinnati, L.L.C. v. Warren Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>BTA No. 2009-V-3796, 2010 WD 3724159 (Sept. 21, 2010). <em>Id. </em>at *5. It further determined that it could not rely on the rest of Horner\u2019s appraisal report for multiple reasons. <em>Id. </em>First, the BTA took issue with the fact that Horner\u2019s calculation of each parcel\u2019s value was based on comparable sales of units within East Bank I and East Bank II, but the report contained withdrawn listings and listing prices \u2014 not sale prices \u2014 of the East Bank I units. <em>Id. </em>Second, it found no evidence that the \u201ccost to finish,\u201d which Horner deducted from each unit\u2019s estimated retail price, conformed to market costs. <em>Id. </em>And third, in response to East Bank\u2019s argument that the auditor had assessed the units as finished units as opposed to unfinished units, the BTA held that it could not make the appropriate adjustments to the valuation since there was no evidence as to the completion percentage of each unit. <em>Id. </em>at *6. It therefore reversed the board of revision\u2019s adjustments and reinstated the auditor\u2019s valuation of the 21 units. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">{\u00b6 10} East Bank appealed the BTA\u2019s decision to this court, contending first that the BTA\u2019s decision is unlawful and unreasonable because it reverted to the auditor\u2019s value when the board of education had introduced no evidence in support of the auditor\u2019s valuation. Second, East Bank argues that the BTA did not hold the board of education to its burden of proof and that it improperly shifted the burden of proof to East Bank. Third, East Bank asserts that the BTA erred as a matter of law by precluding the use of bulk discount factors in East Bank\u2019s valuation and that the BTA acted unreasonably and unlawfully by not valuing the 21 units as a single economic unit. Next, East Bank maintains that the record demonstrates that the units were unfinished on the tax lien date and also establishes the costs to complete the units, and it urges that the BTA acted unreasonably and unlawfully in not applying a discount based upon unfinished property. Finally, East Bank argues that the BTA abused its discretion in rejecting the board of revision\u2019s determination that East Bank presented the requisite evidence of value.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">{\u00b6 11} In response, the board of education asserts that Horner\u2019s appraisal is an \u201cinvestment value appraisal,\u201d which \u201cdoes not constitute competent and probative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>evidence of the true value of real property.\u201d The board of education further argues that because East Bank did not satisfy its initial burden to prove that Horner\u2019s appraisal evidenced the true value of the property, the BTA did not improperly shift the burden of proof to East Bank. The board of education also maintains that \u201c[t]he BTA is not required to accept the opinion of an appraiser <em>concerning the </em>cost <em>to </em>finish a condominium unit without any facts or figures to support that opinion or that the true value of the unit must be reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the amount of the costs to finish the unit.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b304-4\">{\u00b6 12} Thus, we must decide whether the BTA properly reinstated the auditor\u2019s valuation of the condominium units at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">{\u00b6 13} Pursuant to R.C. 5717.04, this court reviews decisions of the BTA to determine whether they are \u201creasonable and lawful.\u201d Our review of a question of law is not deferential but de novo. <em>Akron Centre Plaza, L.L.C. v. Summit Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>128 Ohio St.3d 145, 2010-Ohio-5035, 942 N.E.2d 1054, \u00b6 10. This court will affirm a decision of the BTA only if the BTA correctly applies the law. <em>HIN, L.L.C. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>124 Ohio St.3d 481, 2010-Ohio-687, 923 N.E.2d 1144, \u00b6 13. And, we will uphold the BTA\u2019s determination of fact if the record contains reliable and probative evidence supporting the BTA\u2019s determination. <em>Satullo v. Wilkins, 111 Ohio </em>St.3d 399, 2006-Ohio-5856, 856 N.E.2d 954, \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">Burdens of Proof</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">{\u00b6 14} We have established that the taxpayer bears the burden to establish the right to a deduction and a taxpayer is \u201c \u2018not entitled to the deduction claimed merely because no evidence is adduced contra his claim.\u2019 \u201d <em>Daytom-Montgomery Cty. Port Auth. v. Montgomery Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 281, 2007-Ohio-1948, 865 N.E.2d 22, \u00b6 15, quoting <em>W. Industries, Inc. v. Hamilton Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>170 Ohio St. 340, 342,164 N.E.2d 741 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">{\u00b6 15} When a party appeals a board of revision\u2019s decision to the BTA, the appellant, whether it be a taxpayer or a board of education, has the burden to prove its right to a reduction or increase in the board of revision\u2019s determination of value. <em>Columbus City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>90 Ohio St.3d 564, 566, 740 N.E.2d 276 (2001). To prevail on appeal before the BTA, the appellant must present \u201ccompetent and probative evidence\u201d supporting the value the appellant asserts. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b304-10\">{\u00b6 16} In this case, East Bank had the burden to prove its right to a reduction when it challenged the auditor\u2019s valuation of the 21 units before the board of revision. <em>See Dayton-Montgomery </em>at \u00b6 15. To meet this burden, East Bank presented testimony from its managing partner and an appraiser. The board of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>revision adopted East Bank\u2019s valuation, thereby shifting the burden of going forward with evidence to the board of education on appeal to the BTA to present \u201ccompetent and probative evidence to make its case.\u201d <em>Columbus City School Dist. </em>at 566. However, the board of education did not present any evidence to support its own valuation or the auditor\u2019s valuation and instead chose to attack Horner\u2019s valuation through cross-examination. The board of education thereby failed to sustain its burden. Since the board of education failed to meet its burden on appeal and the only evidence in the record \u2014 the testimony of Babyak and Horner \u2014 negates the auditor\u2019s determination, we now turn to the question of whether the BTA acted reasonably and lawfully by reinstating the auditor\u2019s valuation.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-4\">Reinstatement of the Auditor\u2019s Valuation</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\">{\u00b6 17} In <em>FirstCal Indus. 2 Acquisitions, L.L.C. v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>125 Ohio St.3d 485, 2010-Ohio-1921, 929 N.E.2d 426, \u00b6 31, we explained: \u201c[T]he auditor\u2019s initial determination of value for a given tax year possesses an increment of prima-facie probative force.\u201d But, when a taxpayer presents evidence contrary to the auditor\u2019s valuation and no evidence is offered to support the auditor\u2019s valuation, the BTA may not simply reinstate the auditor\u2019s determination. <em>Daytork-Montgomery, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 281, 2007-Ohio-1948, 865 N.E.2d 22, at \u00b6 27; <em>Bedford Bd. of Edn. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 449, 2007-Ohio-5237, 875 N.E.2d 913, \u00b6 11-12. Instead, \u201conce the BTA had determined that the record contained evidence tending to negate the county\u2019s original valuation, the BTA\u2019s duty was to \u2018determine whether the record as developed by the parties contain[s] sufficient evidence to permit an independent valuation of the property.\u2019 \u201d <em>Vandaliar-Butler City Schools Bd. of Edn. v. Montgomery Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>130 Ohio St.3d 291, 2011-Ohio-5078, 958 N.E.2d 131, \u00b6 26, quoting <em>Colonial Village, Ltd. v. Washington Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 493, 2007-Ohio-4641, 873 N.E.2d 298 <em>(\u201cColonial Village </em>/\u201d), \u00b6 25. Here, the board of education produced no evidence to support its valuation or the auditor\u2019s valuation of the units, nor did it identify the procedures or methods the auditor used in valuing those units.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">{\u00b6 18} In <em>Dayton-Montgomery, </em>the port authority challenged the auditor\u2019s valuation before the board of revision, which slightly decreased the value of the property. After rejecting the port authority\u2019s valuation as \u201cincomplete\u201d and the board of revision\u2019s adjustment as lacking a \u201ccredible explanation,\u201d the BTA had reinstated the auditor\u2019s valuation. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 9. In reversing, we held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b305-7\">when the evidence presented to the board of revision or the BTA contradicts the auditor\u2019s determination in whole or in part, and when no evidence has been adduced to support the auditor\u2019s valuation, the BTA may not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>simply revert to the auditor\u2019s determination. Whenever it does so, the BTA is acting unlawfully by making a finding of value that is affirmatively contradicted by the only evidence in the record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b306-5\"><em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">{\u00b6 19} We reaffirmed this principle in <em>Bedford. </em>Relying on our holding in <em>Daytorir-Montgomery, </em>we found that the BTA\u2019s reinstatement of the auditor\u2019s determination of value as the default value was \u201cnot justified, because the taxpayer had presented evidence contrary to the auditor\u2019s determination to the board of revision.\u201d <em>Bedford </em>at \u00b6 12. We found that the evidence the board of education presented on appeal to the BTA, which simply consisted of testimony suggesting that the parcel at issue should be valued not individually but instead in conjunction with other parcels, \u201cdid not amount to independent evidence of value that would undermine the BOR\u2019s determination\u201d and \u201cdid not support reinstating the auditor\u2019s valuation, because the auditor did not value the property in conjunction with other parcels any more than the BOR did.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">{\u00b6 20} During oral argument, the board of education directed the court to our decision in <em>Colonial Village, Ltd. v. Washington Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>123 Ohio St.3d 268, 2009-Ohio-4975, 915 N.E.2d 1196 <em>(\u201cColonial Village IF), to </em>assert that if the evidence presented is not reliable and is not probative, then the BTA should revert to the auditor\u2019s valuation as the default value. The board of education\u2019s application of <em>Colonial Village II </em>to this case is misplaced. First, the facts of <em>Colonial Village II </em>are distinguishable from the facts of this case because there, the board of revision initially adopted the <em>auditor\u2019s </em>valuation. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 18. Thus, after finding that the taxpayer had not met its burden on appeal, the BTA affirmed the conclusion of the board of revision in reinstating the auditor\u2019s valuation. In contrast, here, the board of revision adopted the <em>taxpayer\u2019s </em>valuation. Since East Bank presented competent, credible evidence of valuation and other evidence negating the auditor\u2019s valuation and the board of education did not present any evidence to support its valuation or the auditor\u2019s valuation, the BTA abused its discretion in reinstating the auditor\u2019s valuation. Second, the board of education fails to recognize that while we stated in <em>Colonial Village II </em>that \u201cthe BTA is justified in retaining the county\u2019s valuation of the property when an appellant fails to sustain its burden of proof at the BTA,\u201d <em>id. </em>at \u00b6 23, we then acknowledged that an exception to this general rule arises when the record affirmatively negates the validity of the county\u2019s valuation. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 24. This case falls under that exception as well because East Bank established a different valuation and the board of education offered no evidence to support its valuation or the auditor\u2019s valuation.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>{\u00b6 21} As in <em>Dayton-Montgomery </em>and <em>Bedford, </em>the BTA\u2019s reinstatement of the auditor\u2019s valuation was \u201cnot justified, because the taxpayer had presented evidence contrary to the auditor\u2019s determination to the board of revision.\u201d <em>Bedford, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 449, 2007-Ohio-5237, 875 N.E.2d 913, at \u00b6 12. In <em>Vandalia-Butler, </em>we clarified our holding in <em>Bedford </em>and explained: \u201cEven if some evidence tends to negate the auditor\u2019s valuation, it is proper to revert to that valuation when the BTA finds that the owner has not proved a lower value and there is otherwise \u2018no evidence from which the BTA can independently determine value.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis deleted.) <em>Id., </em>130 Ohio St.3d 291, 2011-Ohio-5078, 958 N.E.2d 131, at \u00b624, quoting <em>Simmons v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>81 Ohio St.3d 47, 49, 689 N.E.2d 22 (1998). But here, evidence existed from which the BTA could independently determine value. It is clear from a review of the record that the auditor\u2019s valuation of the property was too high. Specifically, there is no evidence indicating that the auditor accounted for the unfinished state of the units or the units\u2019 depreciation in value due to market conditions, and the historical sales evidence provided by East Bank further contradicts the auditor\u2019s valuation.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">{\u00b6 22} Under Ohio law, \u201c[i]f \u00e1 building, structure, fixture or other improvement to land is under construction on January first of any year, its valuation <em>shall be based upon its value or percentage of completion as it existed on January first.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Ohio Adm.Code 5703-25-06(G). East Bank asserts that the majority of the 21 units were 50 percent complete, two units were 60 percent complete, and two units were 80 percent complete.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">{\u00b6 23} In response to East Bank\u2019s argument that the auditor assessed the units based on the full finished retail value of the units, the BTA held that <em>\u201cno evidence </em>has been provided as to the completion percentage of each unit to allow this board to make appropriate adjustments to the properties\u2019 values.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Dublin City Schools Bd. of Edn., </em>2012 WL 3166815, at *6. But this finding of the BTA contradicts the record, which contains evidence of completion percentages of the units. East Bank provided competent evidence as to the completion percentages. Horner accounted for these in his appraisal, and both Horner and Babyak testified regarding the unfinished state of the units. In addition, a review of the property record cards indicates that the auditor considered 16 of the units to be only 85 percent complete as of the tax lien date. However, the record is unclear as to whether the auditor made, adjustments for the costs for completion in his valuation. Since the record contains evidence regarding the completion percentages and there is no evidence to demonstrate that the auditor actually factored the completion percentages into the assessed valuation, the BTA acted unreasonably and unlawfully in reinstating that valuation.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>{\u00b6 24} There is also no indication that the auditor considered the property\u2019s depreciation in value due to the downturn in the economy. Horner\u2019s appraisal provides a \u201cResidential Market Summary,\u201d which explains the substantial drop in \u201cresidential activity\u201d for condominiums and single family homes between 2006 and 2007. Horner also testified that \u201c[b]etween the time that this building was proposed, planned and built, the market dropped significantly.\u201d Further demonstrating the difficult market, East Bank in 2008 considered selling the entire building, including the 21 condominium units at issue, because of the downturn in the economy. East Bank did not pursue the informal offers it received ranging from $1.5 million to $3 million, because these amounts would not have covered the loan value. Considering the market conditions presented before the board of revision and the BTA and the absence of any evidence in the record addressing whether the auditor took those market conditions into account, additional grounds exist for determining that the BTA unreasonably adopted the auditor\u2019s valuation.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">{\u00b6 25} Lastly, the actual historical sales raise doubt as to the accuracy of the auditor\u2019s valuation. Many of the sales of East Bank II condominiums occurring after the tax lien date involved investor discounts ranging from $75,000 to $105,800. Using these sales figures and the actual construction costs to complete the units, Horner opined at the BTA hearing that the cash flow analysis resulted in a value of $2,900,000. This evidence further demonstrates that the auditor\u2019s valuation does not reflect the true market value.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">{\u00b6 26} When confronted with such clear evidence negating the auditor\u2019s valuation, the BTA acted unreasonably and unlawfully in adopting the auditor\u2019s valuation rather than determining the taxable value of the property. It acted \u201cunlawfully by making a finding of value that is affirmatively contradicted by the only evidence in the record.\u201d <em>Dayton-Montgomery, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 281, 2007-Ohio-1948, 865 N.E.2d 22, at \u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">{\u00b6 27} When a board of revision adopts the valuation of property presented by the taxpayer over the auditor\u2019s valuation, the burden shifts to the contesting party on appeal to demonstrate the true value of the property. When the party challenging a board of revision\u2019s determination fails to present any evidence supporting its valuation or the auditor\u2019s valuation and the only evidence in the record negates the auditor\u2019s valuation, the BTA must determine if there is sufficient evidence in the entire record for the BTA to perform an independent analysis. Here, the board of education did not present any evidence before the board of revision or the BTA. Thus, it failed to meet its burden.

The board of revision adopted Horner\u2019s appraisal\u2019s aggregate valuation of $3,100,000, which reflected not only an adjustment for the unfinished state of the condominiums, but also a decrease to 48 percent of what Horner termed the \u201cgross sale proceeds\u201d (sometimes called the \u201cgross sale price\u201d) of the unfinished units. The BTA correctly found that although Horner\u2019s \u201cbulk discount\u201d is an appropriate appraisal method for financial institutions that lend to condominium development projects, it does not apply to appraisals of real property for tax purposes under Ohio law. <em>Dublin City Schools Bd. of Edn. v.

That duty is critically important here because the deficiency in the Horner appraisal that the BTA identified is a legal flaw rather than a factual one, and therefore there was no necessity that the board of education present additional evidence to substantiate that flaw.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">{\u00b6 30} I would affirm the BTA\u2019s decision to the extent that it rejected the bulk-sale approach to valuing the condominiums and thus dissent from the majority\u2019s acceptance of that method of valuation. However, I concur in the majority\u2019s conclusion that the BTA should have determined a discount for the unfinished states of the condominiums on the tax-lien date. To remedy that defect, I would reverse the BTA\u2019s reinstatement of the auditor\u2019s valuation and remand this cause to the BTA for determination of a proper percentage discount as required by Ohio Adm.Code 5703-25-06(G).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">The Homer appraisal\u2019s bulk-discount approach runs afoul of the well-established economic-unit doctrine</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">{\u00b6 31} Because this case involves the valuation of 21 condominium units as of January 1, 2008, the analysis must begin with the recognition that each unit constitutes a separate parcel, in spite of the fact that they all are contained in a common building. The division into separate parcels for property-taxation purposes is a requirement imposed by law. \u201cEach unit of a condominium property * * * is deemed a separate parcel for all purposes of taxation and assessment of real property.\u201d R.C. 5311.11.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-8\">{\u00b6 32} In a county auditor\u2019s capacity as assessor of the real estate tax, the auditor is charged with the duty to \u201cview and appraise or cause to be viewed and appraised at its true value in money, each lot or parcel of real estate.\u201d R.C. 5713.01(B). Read together, Article XII, Section 2 of the Ohio Constitution and R.C. 5713.03 require the auditor, when determining the true value of each parcel, to use either an actual arm\u2019s-length sale price showing the value of the property or an appraisal determining what that sale price would be. <em>Conalco, Inc. v. Monroe Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>50 Ohio St.2d 129, 363 N.E.2d 722 (1977), paragraph one of the syllabus; <em>State ex rel. Park Invest. Co. v. Bd. of Tax Appeals, </em>175 Ohio St. 410, 412,195 N.E.2d 908 (1964); <em>see also Berea City School Disk Bd. of Edn. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>106 Ohio St.3d 269, 2005-Ohio-4979, 834 N.E.2d 782, \u00b6 9-10. The Horner appraisal did not comply with this constitutional and statutory framework.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>{\u00b6 33} In the valuation section of the appraisal report, Horner stated that his appraisal aimed at determining \u201ca bulk purchase value [that] represents what the owner would sell all of the units to a single purchaser [for].\u201d The report proceeded to explain that \u201c[t]he investor,\u201d i.e., the bulk purchaser, would then be \u201centitled to the future profit from the individual sales, but would also incur the cost of holding and selling the units during the absorption period.\u201d Given this premise for the appraisal, the BTA here justifiably relied on its earlier decision in <em>M/I Homes of Cincinnati, L.L.C. v. Warren Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>BTA No. 2009-V-3796, 2010 WL 3724159 (Sept. 21, 2010), to characterize Horner\u2019s approach as \u201can analysis [that] arrives at an investment value, rather than real market value,\u201d of the condominiums as parcels of real property. 2012 WL 3166815 at *4. Simply stated, the Horner appraisal did not value the individual condominiums in terms of what they would ultimately have sold for in the market. Instead, the appraisal projected a bulk-sale price that a developer-buyer or an investor would have paid for all the units together. That bulk price would inevitably have been less than the ultimate sale price of the individual units, because a bulk purchaser would have paid only an amount that would have yielded a profit once the condominiums were sold individually. Thus, the actual sale prices were discounted to a current investment value, but our precedent is clear that it is the sale prices themselves that must be the properties\u2019 values for tax purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">{\u00b6 34} This discounting process becomes graphically visible later in the valuation section of the appraisal report, which shows the allocation of the \u201cas-is price\u201d to each condominium on a per-square-foot basis and then shows the discount taken for each condominium to 48 percent of that price. In addressing a similar type of appraisal, the Oregon Supreme Court cogently stated that because a developer\u2019s discount \u201creduces the market price of the properties by a rate of return based on expected profit, taking into account the expected time necessary to sell the lots,\u201d it does not \u201cassess the value of the properties if put to their highest and best use, but reduces their value to arrive at the value of the properties considered as an investment.\u201d <em>First Interstate Bank of Oregon, N.A. v. Dept. of Revenue, </em>306 Or. 450, 454-455, 760 P.2d 880 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">{\u00b6 35} Additional evidence that the bulk-discount analysis does not indicate the tax value of the individual units is found in Horner\u2019s reliance on the FIRREA exhibit introduced at the BTA hearing. That exhibit includes a statement that for a condominium building with five units or more, a financing institution \u201cmay not use the aggregate retail sales prices of the individual units as the market value to calculate the [loan-to-value] ratio.\u201d That is the rule on which Horner\u2019s bulk discount is based. It states in so many words that the bulk-discount valuation is not equivalent to the sale price of the condominiums. However, the sale price must be the proper measure of value for tax purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>{\u00b6 36} Under certain circumstances, Ohio law may permit multiple parcels to be valued as a single economic unit. But those circumstances are not present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">{\u00b6 37} For example, in <em>Park Ridge Co. v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>29 Ohio St.3d 12, 504 N.E.2d 1116 (1987), this court noted that an \u201ceconomic unit\u201d for tax-valuation purposes may in some situations comprise multiple parcels or a portion of a larger parcel, and stated the test for determining a property\u2019s status as an economic unit: \u201cFor tax valuation purposes, property with a single owner, <em>for which the highest and best use is a single unit, </em>constitutes a tract, lot, or parcel.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Id. </em>at paragraph two of the syllabus. <em>See also Strongsville Bd. of Edn. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>77 Ohio St.3d 402, 404-406, 674 N.E.2d 696 (1997) (citing and applying the <em>Park Ridge </em>syllabus). A determination to value a property as an economic unit therefore depends, as a matter of law, on a finding that the highest and best use of the parcels at issue consists of continued use under common ownership. On this record, the BTA was justified in not making such a finding. Indeed, no evidence in the record would have supported it.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">{\u00b6 38} Far from furnishing support for such a finding, Horner\u2019s appraisal negates it. Several statements in the appraisal indicate that the ultimate sales of the condominiums were anticipated to be as individual units. Moreover, the section of Horner\u2019s appraisal specifically discussing highest and best use states that \u201c[biased on those uses that are legally permissible, physically possible and financially feasible, the maximally productive use of the site involves 28 total living units.\u201d Although this part of the appraisal does not explicitly state that the \u201cliving units\u201d will be individually owned, the statement certainly does not assert that the highest and best use constitutes continued common ownership. This case does not involve an apartment building, in which a single landlord owns the entire building and rents out individual units; this case involves condominiums. Taken in context, the \u201chighest and best use\u201d determination must be that the condominiums will ultimately be individually owned and are not an economic unit.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">{\u00b6 39} In addition to Horner\u2019s original appraisal, the majority refers to Horner\u2019s analysis of actual subsequent sales that he later offered at the BTA hearing as though that analysis somehow corroborates the propriety of the bulk discount in the original appraisal. It does not.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">{\u00b6 40} The majority fails to recognize that the subsequent-sale analysis merely repeats the very same flaw that the BTA identified in the original appraisal. Once again, Horner does not value the individual units according to the price at which they would sell (or the price at which they did, in fact, sell). Rather, Horner for a second time discounts from that \u201cretail\u201d sale price to determine what an investor would have paid in bulk on January 1, 2008, with a view to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>making a profit. The bulk-sale price of $2,900,000 that Horner presented to the BTA turned out to be lower than the $3,100,000 projected in the original appraisal because the sale prices turned out to be lower than projected.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">{\u00b6 41} On redirect examination during the BTA hearing, Horner confirmed this point. He was asked whether the revised $2,900,000 figure \u201creduced lower the net present value [i.e., the bulk-discount valuation of $3,100,000] you came up with in your original appraisal.\u201d Horner answered: \u201cCorrect.\u201d Moreover, Horner testified that the subsequent sales indicated \u201can average of $146 per square foot.\u201d That number, projected over the 42,627 total square feet of the 21 units still to be sold as of January 1, 2008, would have amounted to gross sale proceeds for all 21 units of $6,223,542 (as opposed to the gross sale proceeds of $6,492,294 projected in the original appraisal). Horner\u2019s revised \u201cnet present value\u201d of $2,900,000 was about 47 percent of the gross sale proceeds of $6,223,542, just as the original appraisal\u2019s net present value of $3,100,000 was about 48 percent of- $6,492,294. Thus, the flawed methodology did not change, even though subsequent sales were used.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">{\u00b6 42} The BTA acted reasonably and lawfully in determining that the board of revision had erred by relying on the Horner appraisal\u2019s bulk-discount approach. I must dissent from the majority\u2019s conclusion to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">Because the BTA\u2019s duty is to independently weigh the evidence, it may reverse a decision of a board of revision even if no new evidence is presented before the BTA</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">{\u00b6 43} I also disagree with the majority\u2019s view that because the board of education presented no new evidence at the BTA hearing to controvert the Horner appraisal, the BTA was required to affirm the board of revision\u2019s decision to adopt that appraisal. This reasoning cannot be reconciled with the BTA\u2019s duty to perform a fully independent weighing of the evidence presented at all levels when determining the value of real property.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">{\u00b6 44} Although the majority opinion cites <em>Vandalia-Butler City Schools Bd. of Edn. v. Montgomery Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>130 Ohio St.3d 291, 2011-Ohio-5078, 958 N.E.2d 131, the holding in that case does not support the majority\u2019s analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">{\u00b6 45} In <em>Vandalia-Butler, </em>the property owner filed a complaint and presented evidence before the board of revision, just as in the present case. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 3-4. The board of revision adopted a lower valuation based on the owner\u2019s evidence, just as in the present case. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 6. At the BTA hearing, the board of education argued that the owner\u2019s evidence was insufficient, but it presented no new evidence, just as in the present case. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 8-9.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">{\u00b646} Although the BTA expressed reservations about the quality of the evidence the owner had presented to the board of revision, the BTA stated the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>issue as whether there was sufficient evidence to support the board of revision\u2019s determination. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 9. The BTA ultimately adopted the board of revision\u2019s valuation in spite of its explicit reservations. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">{\u00b6 47} On appeal, we unanimously found error as a matter of law, vacated the BTA\u2019s decision, and remanded to the BTA for further proceedings. We stated that \u201cthe BTA\u2019s crucial error in this case lay in its exclusive reliance on the BOR\u2019s evaluation of the evidence rather than its own.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 14. We specifically faulted the BTA for exercising excessive deference to the board of revision\u2019s decision. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 19. On remand, we ordered the BTA to determine whether sufficient evidence permitted it to perform an independent valuation; if there was sufficient evidence, the BTA was to perform that valuation. If there was not, the BTA was to revert to the auditor\u2019s determination. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 26-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">{\u00b6 48} Our discussion in <em>Vandaliar-Butler </em>of the independent role of the BTA should apply equally to the situation here. Although the unfinished state of the condominiums had to be taken into account when valuing them, the majority fails to recognize the validity of the BTA\u2019s reasonable and lawful rejection of the Horner appraisal\u2019s bulk-discount approach. The BTA\u2019s duty to independently weigh evidence permitted it to reject that bulk-discount approach regardless of whether the school board presented further evidence before the BTA, and its decision should be affirmed to that extent. Our precedent is clear and should be followed here.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">The BTA should have performed an independent determination of the discounted value of the condominiums because of their unfinished state</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">{\u00b6 49} Finally, I concur with the majority that the BTA erred by failing to ensure that the value assigned to the condominiums reflected a discount based on their unfinished state as of January 1, 2008, the tax-lien date. But instead of requiring reinstatement of the board of revision\u2019s decision, which relied on the erroneous bulk-sale approach, this error calls for a remand to the BTA for a proper determination of the percentage discount required by Ohio Adm.Code 5703-25-06(0, which provides that \u201c[i]f a building, structure, fixture or other improvement to land is under construction on January first of any year, its valuation shall be based upon its value or percentage of completion as it existed on January first.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">{\u00b6 50} The property-record cards in this case set forth percentage-of-completion figures, but do not evidence whether the auditor properly applied a discount. Additionally, the Horner appraisal took into account the percentage of completion. I would remand to the BTA with the instruction that the BTA perform an appropriate reduction to account for the unfinished state of the condominiums, basing its finding on the entire record or, if need be, on additional evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>adduced pursuant to the BTA\u2019s authority to \u201cmake * * * investigation concerning the appeal\u201d under R.C. 5717.01.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">{\u00b6 51} I concur in the majority\u2019s conclusion that the auditor\u2019s valuation was too high, but dissent from the remainder of the majority\u2019s opinion and its order that the board of revision\u2019s valuation must be reinstated.</p>\n<judges id=\"b315-6\">Lanzinger and French, JJ., concur in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b309-12\">.

I also agree that the BTA erred when it adopted the auditor\u2019s valuation. I respectfully disagree, however, with the majority\u2019s analysis as to why the board of education failed to meet its burden of proof. The majority opinion implies that an auditor\u2019s appraisal can never, by itself, constitute probative evidence of value. Because this holding contradicts our case law, I cannot endorse it.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-10\">{\u00b6 54} I also respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s decision to adopt East Bank\u2019s valuation of the property, rather than remand this case to the BTA for an independent determination of value. The majority accepts East Bank\u2019s valuation without reason or analysis, and our case law requires a remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-11\">Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b315-12\">\n<em>Burdens of Proof</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b315-13\">{\u00b6 55} In this case, the board of education sought retention of the auditor\u2019s property valuation. This valuation was based on the auditor\u2019s separate appraisals for the condominium units. Al 21 appraisals were in the record before the BTA. When the board of education appealed to the BTA, however, it produced no additional evidence supporting the auditor\u2019s appraisals. Based solely on the fact that the board of education produced no new evidence, the majority concludes that the board of education failed to meet its burden of proof before the BTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-14\">{\u00b6 56} The majority\u2019s conclusion assumes, incorrectly, that a BTA appellant seeking retention of an auditor\u2019s valuation must necessarily support the auditor\u2019s valuation with additional proof. This assumption contradicts our precedent. A party need not, as a matter of course in every case, confirm an auditor\u2019s appraisal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>with further evidence in order to meet its burden of proof. <em>Colonial Village, Ltd. v.

In that scenario, a party must produce proof beyond the auditor\u2019s appraisal. <em>Dayton-Montgomery </em>at \u00b6 27, 30. Here, we need not even consider East Bank\u2019s evidence to determine that the auditor\u2019s appraisal is invalid. The appraisal is deficient on its face. Specifically, the property-record cards do not indicate whether the auditor applied the percentage-of-completion discounts required by Ohio Adm.Code 5703-25-06(G). Because of this deficiency, the board of education had to produce additional support for the auditor\u2019s valuation. It did not, thereby failing to meet its burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-5\">{\u00b6 59} I therefore concur with the majority in two respects: (1) the board of education had to produce additional support for the auditor\u2019s appraisal and (2) because the board of education did not produce this support, it did not meet its burden of proof. I cannot, however, join the majority\u2019s analysis as to why the board of education had to produce more evidence. The majority opinion suggests that a party must <em>always </em>produce additional support for an auditor\u2019s appraisal. This approach contradicts our precedent. I would hold that the board of education had to produce more evidence in this case only because the auditor\u2019s appraisal was deficient on its face.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">\n<em>Remand Is the Proper Remedy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">{\u00b6 60} Because the auditor\u2019s appraisal was deficient on its face and the board of education presented no evidence to cure the deficiency, the BTA erred in adopting the auditor\u2019s valuation. <em>Columbus City School Dist. Bd. of Edn. v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>90 Ohio St.3d 564, 567, 740 N.E.2d 276 (2001) (the BTA cannot adopt a value that is unsupported by the record); <em>Dayton-Montgomery </em>at \u00b6 27 (\u201cwhen the evidence * * * contradicts the auditor\u2019s determination in whole or in part, and when no evidence has been adduced to support the auditor\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>valuation, the BTA may not simply revert to the auditor\u2019s determination\u201d). Instead, the BTA should have conducted its own analysis of the evidence and independently determined the taxable value of the property. <em>Vandaliar-Butler, </em>130 Ohio St.3d 291, 2011-Ohio-5078, 958 N.E.2d 131, at \u00b6 26 (\u201cWhen there is sufficient evidence to permit the BTA to perform an independent valuation * * * the BTA must do so\u201d); <em>Colonial Village, Ltd. v. Washington Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>114 Ohio St.3d 493, 2007-Ohio-4641, 873 N.E.2d 298 <em>(\u201cColonial Village I\u201d), </em>\u00b6 23-25. As the majority points out, at \u00b6 23 of the opinion, the record appears to contain enough evidence for the BTA to independently determine value. And as the chief justice notes in her separate opinion at \u00b6 50, the BTA may always order the presentation of additional evidence if necessary. R.C. 5717.01; <em>Columbus City School Dist. </em>at 567 (remanding to the BTA for an independent determination of value and noting that under R.C. 5717.01, the BTA \u201c \u2018may order the hearing of additional evidence, and may make such investigation concerning the appeal as it deems proper\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">{\u00b6 61} The appropriate remedy for the BTA\u2019s failure to conduct an independent valuation is, not surprisingly, a remand for the BTA to conduct an independent valuation. <em>Colonial Village I </em>at \u00b6 1 (ordering remand for the BTA to conduct an independent valuation of the property after the BTA had unlawfully upheld the auditor\u2019s valuation); <em>Vandaliar-Butler </em>at \u00b6 27 (remanding because the BTA did not conduct an independent analysis of value); <em>Dayton-Montgomery, </em>113 Ohio St.3d 281, 2007-Ohio-1948, 865 N.E.2d 22, at \u00b6 28 (remanding for the BTA to independently determine value). Instead of ordering this remand, though, the majority summarily resolves this case by adopting the same valuation the board of revision adopted \u2014 East Bank\u2019s $3,100,000 appraisal. But the majority opinion offers no explanation as to why East Bank\u2019s valuation is correct or as to how the majority arrived at this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">{\u00b6 62} The majority could not have accepted East Bank\u2019s valuation simply out of deference to the board of revision. Decisions of boards of revision \u201clack * * * any presumption of validity.\u201d <em>Columbus Bd. of Edn. v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>76 Ohio St.3d 13, 16, 665 N.E.2d 1098 (1996); <em>see also Dayton-Montgomery </em>at \u00b6 24. This court would commit serious error if it accepted East Bank\u2019s evidence \u201con the grounds that the board of revision was persuaded\u201d by that evidence. <em>Vandaliar-Butler </em>at \u00b6 14. Doing so would constitute \u201cthe very deference that the case law prohibits.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">{\u00b6 63} East Bank asserts that automatic deference to the board of revision is appropriate here because the board of education did not meet its burden of proof at the BTA. This argument is unpersuasive. The mere fact that the board of education failed to prove the legitimacy of its preferred value tells us only that the board of education\u2019s value loses. It does not tell us that the board of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>revision\u2019s value wins. In every ease, the BTA must conduct a de novo review of the evidence and independently determine the taxable value of the property. <em>Columbus Bd. of Edn. </em>at 15; <em>Vandalicir-Butler, </em>130 Ohio St.3d 291, 2011-Ohio-5078, 958 N.E.2d 131, at \u00b6 13-14,19.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">{\u00b6 64} Although the board of revision is not entitled to automatic deference, this court could still adopt the board of revision\u2019s valuation if the court independently found that the record supports the board of revision\u2019s decision. <em>VandaliaButler </em>at \u00b6 21 (the board of revision\u2019s value may be adopted <em>\u201cif and only if\u201d </em>the evidence is independently found to support the board of education\u2019s value [emphasis sic]); <em>Bedford Bd. of Edn. v. Cuyahoga Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 449, 2007-Ohio-5237, 875 N.E.2d 913, \u00b6 15. But the majority does not make any such finding. To the contrary, it openly declines to consider whether East Bank\u2019s appraisal methods were appropriate. Majority opinion at \u00b6 27, fn. 1. The end result is puzzling: the majority refuses to analyze whether East Bank\u2019s appraisal was valid, but then \u2014 without explanation \u2014 accepts the appraisal as valid.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">{\u00b6 65} Ultimately, the majority could not adopt East Bank\u2019s valuation based on deference to the board of revision, and it did not adopt East Bank\u2019s valuation based on its own analysis of the evidence. Furthermore, I agree with the chief justice that if the majority had reviewed the evidence, it would find that East Bank\u2019s appraisal method was not valid. Accordingly, our precedent compels a remand to the BTA.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">{\u00b6 66} I concur in the majority\u2019s holding that the board of education had to support the auditor\u2019s valuation with additional evidence. I also agree that because the board of education did not produce more evidence, it did not meet its burden of proof. I respectfully dissent from the majority opinion to the extent that it holds that the board of education was required to produce more evidence as a general rule. The additional support is required in this case only because the auditor\u2019s appraisal was deficient on its face. I also respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s adoption of East Bank\u2019s valuation. There is no basis for adopting East Bank\u2019s valuation, and the majority offers none. We should vacate the BTA\u2019s decision and remand for the BTA to conduct an independent determination of value.</p>\n<judges id=\"b319-8\">O\u2019Connor, C.J., and Lanzinger, J., concur in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b316-7\">. During oral argument, East Bank\u2019s counsel conceded that an auditor\u2019s appraisal can be valid on its face, without supporting evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b317-8\">. I also stress that an auditor\u2019s appraisal does not lose probative value merely because a board of revision rejects it. A board of revision\u2019s decision \u201claek[s] * * any presumption of validity.\u201d <em>Columbus Bd. of Edn. v. Franklin Cty. Bd. of Revision, </em>76 Ohio St.3d 13, 16, 665 N.E.2d 1098 (1996). The decision does not, therefore, set a baseline that the parties start from once they reach the BTA. Nor does it impose a handicap that the BTA appellant must overcome with new evidence. The BTA reviews cases de novo, without giving any deference to what the board of revision decided. <em>Id. </em>at 15; <em>Vandalia-Butler, </em>130 Ohio St.3d 291, 2011-Ohio-5078, 958 N.E.2d 131, at \u00b6 13-14, 19.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
