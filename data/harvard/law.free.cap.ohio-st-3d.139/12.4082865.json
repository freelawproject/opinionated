Trial Evidence</p>\n<p id=\"b121-9\">{\u00b6 2} Evidence introduced at trial showed that McCorkle and Maxwell had a long-term relationship that began in 1999, living together on different occasions over the next few years. They had one child, C.M., nearly four years old. Nichole also had two other children, D.C. and D.K. In August 2005, she purchased a single-family home at 1046 East 146th Street in Cleveland and lived there with her father and two of the children. Maxwell had a key to the side door of the house and kept some clothes there.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-10\">\n<em>The underlying assault</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b121-11\">{\u00b6 3} The prosecution introduced evidence showing that on October 6, 2005, Nichole went to the hospital and received stitches for head injuries after Maxwell struck her. Police came to the hospital and took Nichole\u2019s report about the incident. On the same date, Maxwell told John Gregg, a friend and coworker, that he had pistol-whipped Nichole. On October 13, 2005, she obtained a temporary protection order against Maxwell.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-12\">{\u00b6 4} Afterward, prosecutors presented felonious-assault charges against Maxwell to the grand jury. Nichole was subpoenaed to testify before it on November 23, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-13\">{\u00b6 5} Maxwell told Gregg that he was concerned about receiving prison time for felonious assault. Maxwell knew about the temporary protection order and that a warrant had been issued for his arrest. He had also learned that Nichole was going to testify against him at the grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-14\">{\u00b6 6} At Maxwell\u2019s behest, Gregg contacted Nichole about her grand jury testimony in an effort to reduce the charges from felonious assault to a lesser offense. Gregg asked Nichole to \u201cstick to the story that it was a simple domestic; she pushed him, he pushed her, she slipped and hit her head on the stove.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>\n<em>A. Nichole\u2019s grand jury testimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">{\u00b6 7} Following Nichole\u2019s testimony on November 23, 2005, the grand jury indicted Maxwell for felonious assault, abduction, and domestic violence. Brian Mooney, an assistant prosecutor for Cuyahoga County, informed Nichole that day that the grand jury had voted to indict and told her what the charges were. Because of the Thanksgiving holiday, the indictment was not signed by the grand jury foreman and filed with the clerk of court until November 28, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">{\u00b6 8} The evening of the grand jury\u2019s decision, Maxwell called Gregg and said that he had been trying to talk to Nichole about her grand jury testimony but had been unable to contact her. Maxwell then called Nichole while Gregg remained on the line and heard their conversation. Maxwell asked Nichole what happened in court that day. Nichole told him, \u201cI told the truth. I had to tell the truth.\u201d According to Gregg, Maxwell was very upset after the phone call and said that \u201cthe bitch was going to make him kill her.\u201d Maxwell also asked Gregg where he could get a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-7\">\n<em>B. The events of November 26 and 27, 2005</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b122-8\">{\u00b6 9} The prosecution presented evidence that on the evening of November 26, 2005, Nichole and Willie Hutchinson met at a bar. Lauretta Kenney, Nichole\u2019s sister, had introduced Hutchinson to Nichole after the October 6 incident. Nichole and Hutchinson arrived at the bar in separate cars and had a few drinks. When they departed, although Nichole had told Hutchinson that she would call him when she got home, she did not. But Hutchinson called Nichole, and a man answered the phone. Hutchinson then called Lauretta and told her to check on Nichole.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-9\">{\u00b6 10} Near 2:30 a.m. on November 27, Lauretta called Nichole, and Maxwell answered the phone. Maxwell immediately gave the phone to Nichole. Lauretta asked Nichole why Maxwell was there and told her that he needed to leave. According to Lauretta, Nichole said that \u201cshe was confused and she didn\u2019t know what was going on.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b122-10\">{\u00b6 11} Lauretta then drove to Nichole\u2019s home and arrived around 2:40 a.m. but did not see Maxwell\u2019s car on the street or in the driveway. Lauretta called Nichole, saying she was outside. Nichole \u201cmumbled something\u201d and then hung up. Lauretta went onto the porch, and Nichole and Maxwell were standing next to each other when Lauretta opened the screen door.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-11\">{\u00b6 12} Lauretta told Maxwell that he was not supposed to be there and needed to leave. Maxwell said that he was just talking to Nichole. Lauretta testified, \u201cI told him, there\u2019s no talking, that you needed to leave.\u201d He then called Lauretta \u201ca bitch\u201d and said, \u201c[I]f anybody\u2019s leaving it\u2019s going to be you.\u201d Maxwell then stepped back and pulled a gun from his pants. Nichole screamed, \u201c[0]h my God, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>Lauretta, he got a gun, run.\u201d Lauretta then jumped off the porch and started running. Lauretta heard two gunshots as she ran across the street and heard a third gunshot after she crossed the street. Lauretta then saw Maxwell kneeling down by Nichole.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-6\">{\u00b6 13} C.M., a day short of four years old, was standing near Maxwell and Nichole when Lauretta came to the door. Later, when asked what she had seen, C.M. testified, \u201cHe shoot my mommy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-7\">{\u00b6 14} Maxwell ran from the house after shooting Nichole and fled down the street. Lauretta followed him for a short distance before he disappeared. Shortly afterwards, police officers and emergency medical personnel arrived on the scene. Nichole was taken to the hospital, where she died from her injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-8\">{\u00b6 15} On the morning of November 27, Michelle Kenney, Nichole\u2019s other \u2022 sister, called Gregg and told him that Maxwell had killed Nichole. Gregg said that he then called Maxwell and asked him if he had killed Nichole. Maxwell admitted killing her and recounted what happened. He said he had followed Nichole from her home to the bar. She went into the bar, and Maxwell waited outside in his car. He then went inside and saw Nichole and another man sitting in the back of the bar \u201cmaking out.\u201d Maxwell then returned to his car and waited. After they left the bar, he followed Nichole and the man as they drove in separate cars to Nichole\u2019s house. Nichole kissed the man and went into her house, and the man drove away.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">{\u00b6 16} Gregg also testified that Maxwell told him that he called Nichole after the other man drove away and asked if he could come over. Nichole said he could, and Maxwell went to her house. Maxwell answered the phone at Nichole\u2019s house, including repeated calls from a man who asked to speak to Nichole. He also answered a call from Lauretta. Maxwell told Gregg that \u201cthey started arguing and then he confronted her about that night.\u201d Lauretta then came to the front door, and Maxwell \u201copened the door[,] pointed the gun and fired but she had ran.\u201d Then, Maxwell told Gregg, \u201che just turned around, shot Nichole and she fell down and * * * she moved and then he shot her again.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-10\">\n<em>C. The police investigation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b123-11\">{\u00b6 17} Police investigators found two .25 caliber shell casings inside the house. Investigators looked inside and outside the house for a third shell casing, which they never found. Investigators also did not find any bullet holes inside or outside the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-12\">{\u00b6 18} Dr. David Dolinak, a medical examiner with the Cuyahoga County coroner\u2019s office, conducted Nichole\u2019s autopsy. Nichole suffered two gunshot wounds to the head. One gunshot in the middle of the right eyebrow broke the bones of the eye socket. The bullet did not enter the brain but lodged in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>sinuses on the right side of the nose. The other gunshot went through the left side of the head into the right side of the brain. Dr. Dolinak concluded that Nichole died from gunshot wounds to the head and that the death was a homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">{\u00b6 19} Detective James Ealey, a firearms examiner with the Cleveland Police Department, examined the two bullets recovered during the autopsy. Ealey testified that they had been fired from the same weapon. His written report stated that the bullets were \u201cconsistent with 25 auto type ammunition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">{\u00b6 20} The police sought to locate and arrest Maxwell following Nichole\u2019s death. On December 16, 2005, FBI Special Agent Robert Riddlebarger and other members of the Cleveland/Cuyahoga County Fugitive/Gang Task Force went to a Cleveland home to arrest him. After entering the home, they found Maxwell hiding in a crawl space behind a bed in a second-floor bedroom. As he was being handcuffed, Maxwell was asked whether he was armed or whether there were any weapons nearby. He replied, \u201cI do not have a gun anymore.\u201d A few seconds later, Maxwell blurted out that he had gotten rid of the gun that he had.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">{\u00b6 21} The defense presented no witnesses during the guilt phase of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">II. Case History</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">{\u00b6 22} Maxwell was indicted on two counts of aggravated murder. Count One charged him with the aggravated murder of Nichole with prior calculation and design. Count Two charged him with the aggravated murder of Nichole while committing kidnapping and/or aggravated burglary. Both counts contained death-penalty specifications for a course of conduct involving multiple murders or attempted murders, R.C. 2929.04(A)(5), murder while committing kidnapping or aggravated burglary, R.C. 2929.04(A)(7), murder in retaliation for testimony in a criminal proceeding, R.C. 2929.04(A)(8), and murder to escape accounting for a crime, R.C. 2929.04(A)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">{\u00b6 23} Maxwell was also charged with six additional counts: Count Three\u2014 kidnapping, Counts Four and Five \u2014 aggravated burglary, Count Six \u2014 the attempted murder of Lauretta Kenney, Count Seven \u2014 retaliation against Nichole because she filed criminal charges against him, and Count Eight \u2014 having a weapon while under disability. Counts One through Seven each contained a firearm specification.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-11\">{\u00b6 24} Maxwell pled not guilty to all charges and specifications. The matter proceeded to a jury trial on the first seven counts, while Maxwell waived a jury trial on Count Eight. At the close of the state\u2019s case, defense counsel filed a Crim.R. 29 motion to dismiss the charges. The trial court granted the motion to dismiss Counts Two through Five and the felony-murder death-penalty specification but denied the motion to dismiss the other charges. The jury found Maxwell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>guilty of Counts One and Seven, the retaliation and murder-to-escape-accounting specifications, and two firearm specifications. He was found not guilty of Count Six and the course-of-conduct specification. Separately, the trial court found Maxwell guilty of having a weapon while under a disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">{\u00b6 25} Prior to sentencing, the R.C. 2929.04(A)(3) specification was merged into the R.C. 2929.04(A)(8) specification. Following the presentation of evidence in the penalty phase of the trial, the jury recommended that Maxwell be sentenced to death. The trial court accepted the jury\u2019s recommendation, and Maxwell was sentenced to death on Count One. He was also sentenced to five years in prison for the independent count of retaliation, three years on the firearm specification, and five years for having a weapon under a disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">III. Issues on Appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">{\u00b6 26} The principal issues for review include the adequacy of trial counsel\u2019s preparation and presentation of mitigating evidence, the trial court\u2019s failure to appoint a neurologist, the admissibility of Maxwell\u2019s statements to police at the time of his arrest, and the admissibility of the medical examiner\u2019s testimony and the autopsy report under <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">{\u00b6 27} In this appeal, Maxwell raises 19 propositions of law. We will address the issues in the approximate order that they arose during the trial; however, we will first discuss proposition of law XV, which deals with the admissibility of the medical examiner\u2019s testimony and the autopsy report, as those issues present novel questions of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">Proposition of Law XV</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">{\u00b6 28} In proposition of law XV, Maxwell argues that the trial court erred by admitting the autopsy report on Nichole McCorkle and by allowing Dr. Felo, who did not conduct the autopsy, to testify about the autopsy results in violation of his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation and <em>Crawford.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b125-10\">{\u00b6 29} Dr. David Dolinak conducted Nichole\u2019s autopsy on November 28, 2005. The prosecution called Dr. Joseph Felo to testify about the autopsy instead of Dr. Dolinak, who at the time of trial had become the medical examiner for Austin, Texas. Maxwell objected to Dr. Felo\u2019s testimony, citing <em>Crawford </em>and the best-evidence rule. The trial court cited <em>State v. Craig, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 306, 2006-Ohio-4571, 853 N.E.2d 621, and allowed Dr. Felo to substitute as a witness. Dr. Dolinak\u2019s autopsy report was also admitted into evidence over defense objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-11\">{\u00b6 30} Dr. Felo testified that he had reviewed the autopsy report and the autopsy photographs and x-rays of the victim and looked at tissue slides under the microscope. He discussed the external examination of Nichole that was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>conducted during the autopsy. He testified that there were two gunshot wounds to the head and a bruise in the midportion of the chest. He referred to the autopsy report in stating that this injury \u201cwas interpreted to be because of medical therapy, CPR, doing chest compressions.\u201d He testified that the internal examination of the skull revealed a tear going through the right eyeball and into the brain. There was also some bleeding and bruising caused by bullets going through the brain.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">{\u00b6 31} Dr. Felo referred directly to the autopsy report in discussing the victim\u2019s wounds. He testified, \u201cGunshot wound number one <em>is described </em>as being in the right eyebrow\u201d (emphasis added), and he referred to the autopsy report in describing the trajectory of the gunshot. He also testified that the bullet from the other gunshot traveled \u201cthrough the scalp and through the brain and skull from the left side going towards her right side.\u201d He used autopsy photographs to illustrate this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">{\u00b6 32} Dr. Felo testified that microscopic examination showed the tears and bleeding caused by the bullets going through the brain, that microscopic evaluation of swabs taken from the victim\u2019s mouth, vagina, and rectum revealed no evidence of sperm, and that stippling was found around both entrance wounds. He expressed his opinion that stippling is generally found when \u201cit\u2019s within 18 inches of the end of the muzzle to the target.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">{\u00b6 33} Although Dr. Felo testified that the Cuyahoga County coroner had established the cause and manner of death, he also provided his own opinion, stating, \u201cThe cause of Nichole Anna Maria McCorkle\u2019s death is gunshot wounds of [the] head * * *. The manner of death is a homicide.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">{\u00b6 34} The Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause provides, \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right * * * to be confronted with the witnesses against him * * *.\u201d The United States Supreme Court has interpreted this to mean that admission of an out-of-court statement of a witness who does not appear at trial is prohibited by the Confrontation Clause if the statement is testimonial unless the witness is unavailable and the defendant has had a prior opportunity to cross-examine the witness. <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. 36, 53-54, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-9\">{\u00b6 35} <em>Crawford </em>did not define the word \u201ctestimonial\u201d but stated generally that the core class of statements implicated by the Confrontation Clause includes statements \u201c \u2018made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 52, quoting the amicus brief of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. The Crawford opinion announced a \u201cfundamentally new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>interpretation of the confrontation right.\u201d <em>Williams v. Illinois, </em>\u2014 U.S. 132 S.Ct. 2221, 2232, 183 L.Ed.2d 89 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">{\u00b6 36} We have already considered the distinction between testimonial and nontestimonial statements. In <em>State v. Craig, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 306, 2006-Ohio-4571, 853 N.E.2d 621, \u00b6 88, we held that an autopsy report completed by a nontestifying medical examiner was admissible as a nontestimonial business record under Evid.R. 803(6). We held that there was no Sixth Amendment violation in admitting the autopsy report because <em>Cranford </em>had indicated that \u201cbusiness records are, \u2018by their nature,\u2019 not testimonial\u201d and were therefore admissible. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 81, quoting <em>Cranford </em>at 56. We stated, \u201cAn autopsy report, prepared by a medical examiner and documenting objective findings, is the \u2018quintessential business record.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 82, quoting <em>Rollins v. State, </em>161 Md.App. 34, 81, 866 A.2d 926 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">{\u00b6 37} After our decision in <em>Craig, </em>the United States Supreme Court decided that analysts who had performed laboratory tests were required to testify. <em>Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, </em>557 U.S. 305, 129 S.Ct. 2527, 174 L.Ed.2d 314 (2009). While the dissent states that the reasoning in <em>Craig </em>has been undone by <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>we do not agree. In <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>the court held that three notarized certificates of analysis showing that a forensic analysis identified cocaine were inadmissible. Being \u201cquite plainly affidavits,\u201d they constituted testimonial statements because they were \u201cfunctionally identical to live, in-court testimony, doing \u2018precisely what a witness does on direct examination.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 310-311, quoting <em>Davis v. Washington, </em>547 U.S. 813, 830, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224 (2006). The affidavits were also \u201c \u2018 \u201cmade under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statements] would be available for use at a later trial.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 311, quoting <em>Cranford, </em>541 U.S. at 52, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177, quoting the amicus brief of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. Thus, the analysts who had provided the affidavits were witnesses for Confrontation Clause purposes, and the defendant had the right to confront them. <em>Id. </em>at 311.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-9\">{\u00b6 38} Shortly afterwards, we considered how foundational testimony is to be presented for DNA analysis. <em>State v. Crager, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 369, 2007-Ohio-6840, 879 N.E.2d 745. In <em>Crager, </em>a DNA expert from the Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation (\u201cBCI\u201d) had testified about a DNA analysis performed by another agent. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 8. We held that the DNA report was a nontestimonial business record and that its introduction without the testimony of the BCI agent who prepared it did not violate <em>Crawford. Id. </em>at \u00b6 78-79. Relying upon our earlier opinion, we stated, \u201cThe autopsy report at issue in <em>Craig </em>is not distinguishable from the DNA reports in this case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 51. \u201cAs in <em>Craig, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>the scientific-test reports in this case were prepared in the ordinary course of regularly conducted business and so were not testimonial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 54. The United States Supreme Court vacated the judgment in <em>Crager </em>and remanded the case for further consideration in light of <em>Melendez-Diaz. Crager v. Ohio, </em>557 U.S. 930, 129 S.Ct. 2856, 174 L.Ed.2d 598 (2009). Thereafter, without deciding whether Crager\u2019s right to confront witnesses had been denied, we \u201cvacat[ed] the judgment of the trial court and remand[ed] the cause to the trial court for a new trial consistent with <em>Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts.\u201d State v. Crager, </em>123 Ohio St.3d 1210, 2009-Ohio-4760, 914 N.E.2d 1055, \u00b6 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">{\u00b6 39} Next, the Supreme Court decided <em>Bullcoming v. New Mexico, </em>564 U.S. -, 131 S.Ct. 2705, 180 L.Ed.2d 610 (2011). In <em>Bullcoming, </em>instead of calling the analyst who signed and certified the forensic report for blood-alcohol concentration in a DWI case, the prosecution introduced the lab report through the testimony of another analyst who had not performed or observed the analysis but was familiar with the testing procedures of the laboratory. Although the witness was a \u201cknowledgeable representative of the laboratory\u201d who could \u201cexplain the lab\u2019s processes and the details of the report,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 2723 (Kennedy, J, dissenting), the majority held that the surrogate witness was not a proper substitute for the analyst who had conducted the test. The court concluded, \u201cThe accused\u2019s right is to be confronted with the analyst who made the certification * * <em>Id. </em>at 2710.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-7\">{\u00b6 40} <em>Bullcoming </em>also held that the blood-alcohol analysis reports were testimonial. The court stated, \u201cIn all material respects, the laboratory report in this case resembles those in <em>Melendez-Diaz. </em>Here, as in <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>a law-enforcement officer provided seized evidence to a state laboratory required by law to assist in police investigations. * * * Like the analysts in <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>[the certifying analyst] tested the evidence and prepared a certificate concerning the result of his analysis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2717. Thus, while the <em>Crawford </em>court declined to define \u201ctestimonial,\u201d later decisions seem to explain the meaning of the word by stating that testimonial statements are those made for \u201ca primary purpose of creating an out-of-court substitute for trial testimony.\u201d <em>Michigan v. Bryant, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 1143, 1155, 179 L.Ed.2d 93 (2011); <em>see also Bullcoming </em>at 2714, fn. 6, quoting <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S. at 822, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224 (\u201cTo rank as \u2018testimonial,\u2019 a statement must have a \u2018primary purpose\u2019 of \u2018establishing] or proving] past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution\u2019 \u201d). If a statement\u2019s primary purpose is anything else, the statement is nontestimonial. Its admissibility is \u201cthe concern of state and federal rules of evidence, not the Confrontation Clause.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b128-10\">{\u00b6 41} Most recently, five justices held that expert testimony from a forensic specialist did not violate a defendant\u2019s right to confrontation. <em>Williams v. Illinois, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2221, 183 L.Ed.2d 89 (2012). The expert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>witness testified that a DNA profile produced by an outside laboratory (Cell-mark) from a rape victim\u2019s vaginal swabs matched the defendant\u2019s DNA profile produced by a state police lab from the defendant\u2019s blood sample. <em>Id. </em>at 2229-2230. The Cellmark report itself was neither admitted into evidence nor shown to the fact-finder. The expert witness also did not quote or read from the report or identify the report as the source of any of her opinions. <em>Id. </em>at 2230.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">{\u00b6 42} Four of the five justices reasoned that the statements in the Cellmark report were nontestimonial because, first, the out-of-court statements were related by the expert solely for the purpose of explaining the assumptions on which the expert\u2019s opinion relied and were not offered for their truth. <em>Id. </em>at 2240-2241. And second, even if the Cellmark report had been admitted into evidence, it was not a testimonial document, because it was not prepared for \u201cthe primary purpose of accusing a targeted individual,\u201d which distinguished this report from the forensic reports in <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>and <em>Bullcoming. Id. </em>at 2242. Justice Thomas agreed that the expert\u2019s testimony did not violate the Confrontation Clause, but only because the Cellmark report \u201clacked the requisite \u2018formality and solemnity\u2019 to be considered \u2018testimonial\u2019 for purposes of the Confrontation Clause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2255 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment), quoting <em>Bryant </em>at 1167 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">{\u00b6 43} The admission of the autopsy report and Dr. Felo\u2019s testimony must now be considered in light of the foregoing cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">\n<em>Maxwell\u2019s arguments</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b129-7\">{\u00b6 44} Maxwell argues that <em>Bullcoming </em>prohibited Dr. Felo\u2019s surrogate testimony about Nichole\u2019s autopsy even though he was a \u201cknowledgeable representative\u201d who could explain the lab\u2019s processes and the details of the autopsy report. Maxwell emphasizes that Dr. Felo\u2019s testimony was introduced to prove a key fact at trial and was offered for the truth of the hearsay. Thus, Maxwell argues that he was entitled to confront and cross-examine the medical examiner who actually performed Nichole\u2019s autopsy and wrote the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-8\">{\u00b6 45} Maxwell argues that <em>Williams, </em>a decision resulting from a bench trial, should be distinguished from his case, which was tried before a jury without any limiting instructions regarding the purpose for which the report could be considered. He emphasizes that the <em>Williams </em>plurality indicated that the DNA testimony might not have been admissible if that defendant had elected to have a jury trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-9\">{\u00b6 46} Maxwell also argues that unlike the purpose in <em>Williams, </em>the primary purpose of the autopsy and the related report was to establish that Nichole\u2019s death resulted from a crime rather than an accident, suicide, or other means. Thus, Maxwell argues that Dr. Felo\u2019s testimony and the introduction of the autopsy report resulted in a Confrontation Clause violation because the purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>was \u201c \u2018 \u201cto establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecutions,\u201d \u2019 \u201d quoting <em>Williams, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. at 2251, 183 L.Ed.2d 89 (Breyer, J., concurring), quoting <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S. at 822, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">\n<em>The state\u2019s arguments</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b130-7\">{\u00b6 47} The state advances three main arguments for the admissibility of the autopsy report and the deputy coroner\u2019s testimony. First, the state argues that this court should continue to apply <em>Craig, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 306, 2006-Ohio-4571, 853 N.E.2d 621, \u00b6 88, in which we held that an autopsy report completed by a nontestifying medical examiner was admissible as a nontestimonial business record under Evid.R. 803(6). Second, the state argues that the coroner has a duty to conduct autopsies and maintain reports and that this duty exists entirely independently of any potential criminal prosecution that might later occur. The state also asserts that autopsy reports are not created for the purpose of litigation, because they do not identify suspects and are not accusatory in nature. Third, the state also points out that the passage of time can easily lead to the unavailability of the medical examiner who conducted an autopsy and that requiring the medical examiner who conducted the autopsy to testify would be equivalent to placing a statute of limitations on murder prosecutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-8\">{\u00b6 48} Finally, even if admission of the autopsy report and Dr. Felo\u2019s testimony violated Maxwell\u2019s right to confrontation, the state argues that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b130-10\">{\u00b6 49} A key element in evaluating the admissibility of the coroner\u2019s testimony and the autopsy report in light of the recent United States Supreme Court cases is the primary-purpose test, which examines the reasons for and purpose of the record in question. To determine the primary purpose, a court must \u201cobjectively evaluate] the statements and actions of the parties to the encounter\u201d giving rise to the statements. <em>Bryant, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. at 1162, 179 L.Ed.2d 93; <em>see also Williams, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. at 2243, 183 L.Ed.2d 89 (plurality opinion of Alito, J.).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-14\">\n<em>Coroner\u2019s testimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b130-15\">{\u00b6 50} Although Maxwell relies on <em>Bullcoming, </em>which disallowed surrogate testimony and held that the blood-alcohol reports admitted during the surrogate\u2019s testimony were testimonial, the majority of jurisdictions that have examined this issue have concluded that a substitute examiner, on direct examination, may at least testify as to his or her own expert opinions and conclusions regarding the autopsy and the victim\u2019s death. <em>E.g., Commonwealth v. Avila, </em>454 Mass. 744, 762, 912 N.E.2d 1014 (2009) (\u201cthe expert witness\u2019s testimony must be confined to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>his or her own opinions and, as to these, the expert is available for cross-examination\u201d); <em>Commonwealth v. Phim, </em>462 Mass. 470, 479, 969 N.E.2d 663 (2012) (a substitute medical examiner may not testify on direct examination as to facts and conclusions stated in an autopsy report without personal knowledge or having independently reached the same conclusion); <em>State v. Joseph, </em>230 Ariz. 296, 298, 283 P.3d 27 (2012) (as long as the substitute expert reaches his or her own conclusions, the Confrontation Clause is satisfied).</p>\n<p id=\"b131-6\">{\u00b6 51} The Supreme Court of California, however, expanded the scope of admissible opinion testimony by a substitute examiner. The court allowed the substitute medical examiner to testify regarding his \u201cindependent opinion\u201d as an expert witness as to the cause of the victim\u2019s death, when that opinion was based solely on a review of the autopsy report. <em>People v. Dungo, </em>55 Cal.4th 608, 618, 147 Cal.Rptr.3d 527, 286 P.3d 442 (2012). Because the expert witness did not describe the conclusions reached by the nontestifying examiner, and the expert\u2019s descriptions were limited to objective facts, such as the condition of the victim\u2019s body at the time of the autopsy, these types of statements were not testimonial in nature. <em>Id. </em>at 619.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-7\">{\u00b6 52} We agree. Maxwell\u2019s argument is also not persuasive because the <em>Williams </em>plurality stated that the forensic report (the Cellmark report) could have been admitted into evidence without violating the Confrontation Clause. <em>Williams, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. at 2242,183 L.Ed.2d 89.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-8\">{\u00b6 53} Dr. Felo testified that he reached his own independent judgment on the cause and manner of Nichole\u2019s death based upon his analysis of the evidence in the autopsy report, which itself was admitted. His conclusions were the same as those in the report. But after reviewing the forensic evidence, Dr. Felo also provided some opinions that were not included in the autopsy report. For example, he provided his own conclusions about muzzle-to-target distance based on stippling around the entrance wounds on Nichole\u2019s head. Such testimony constituted Dr. Felo\u2019s original observations and opinions and did not violate the Confrontation Clause, because he was available for cross-examination regarding them.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-9\">\n<em>Autopsy report</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b131-10\">{\u00b6 54} In 2006, this court concluded that an autopsy report was a nontestimonial business record and that its admission did not impinge on a defendant\u2019s confrontation rights. <em>Craig, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 306, 2006-Ohio-4571, 853 N.E.2d 621, \u00b6 81-88 (applying <em>Crawford v. Washington). </em>Although the United States Supreme Court has decided several confrontation cases since our decision, they do not require departure from our holding in <em>Craig.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b131-11\">{\u00b6 55} Maxwell invokes the primary-purpose test that the <em>Williams </em>plurality discussed. The <em>Williams </em>plurality stated that the Cellmark report could have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>been admitted into evidence because it \u201cwas not prepared for the primary-purpose of accusing a <em>targeted </em>individual\u201d of engaging in criminal conduct. (Emphasis added.) <em>Williams, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. at 2243, 183 L.Ed.2d 89. In contrast, Maxwell argues that the primary purpose of the autopsy and the related report was to establish that Nichole\u2019s death was a crime. However, Maxwell fails to mention that five justices in <em>Williams </em>rejected the plurality\u2019s narrowed definition of the primary-purpose test (the targeted-individual test). <em>Id. </em>at 2273 (Kagan, J., dissenting). Thus, Maxwell\u2019s reliance on the plurality\u2019s narrowed definition of the primary-purpose test is not helpful to our resolution of this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">{\u00b6 56} Meanwhile, the state urges us to continue to adhere to <em>Craig\u2019s </em>holding that an autopsy report is admissible as a nontestimonial business record. But an otherwise inadmissible testimonial statement may not be admitted into evidence based upon the business-and-official-records hearsay exception. <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>557 U.S. at 324, 129 S.Ct. 2527, 174 L.Ed.2d 314. Although documents kept in the regular course of business are ordinarily admitted into evidence under the hearsay exception, they are inadmissible \u201cif the regularly conducted business activity is the production of evidence for use at trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 321. When a statement is \u201c \u2018made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial,\u2019 \u201d it is considered testimonial. <em>Id. </em>at 311, quoting <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 52, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177. Thus, labeling autopsy reports as \u201cbusiness records\u201d does not end the inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">{\u00b6 57} An analysis of the primary-purpose test bears out <em>Craig\u2019s </em>conclusion that autopsy reports are nontestimonial. Autopsy reports are not intended to serve as an \u201cout-of-court substitute for trial testimony.\u201d <em>Bryant, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. at 1155, 179 L.Ed.2d 93. Instead, they are created \u201cfor the primary purpose of documenting cause of death for public records and public health.\u201d Carolyn Zabryeki, Comment, <em>Toward a Definition of \u201cTestimonial\u201d: How Autopsy Reports Do Not Embody the Qualities of a Testimonial Statement, </em>96 CaLL.Rev. 1093, 1130 (2008); <em>see also People v. Leach, </em>2012 IL 111534, 366 Ill.Dec. 477, 980 N.E.2d 570, \u00b6 129 (a medical examiner is \u201ccharged with protecting the public health by determining the cause of a sudden death\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b132-11\">\n<em>Ohio statutes</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b132-12\">{\u00b6 58} Ohio coroners conduct autopsies pursuant to the authority granted to them by R.C. Chapter 313. Coroners must \u201ckeep a complete record of and * * * fill in the cause of death on the death certificate, in all cases coming under [their] jurisdiction.\u201d R.C. 313.09. The death certificate also must indicate the \u201cmanner and mode in which the death occurred.\u201d R.C. 313.19. If the cause and manner of death are not apparent \u2014 as when someone \u201cdies as a result of criminal or other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>violent means, by casualty, by suicide, or in any suspicious or unusual manner\u201d or \u201cwhen any person * * * dies suddenly when in apparent good health,\u201d R.C. 313.12 \u2014 the coroner is notified so that an autopsy may be conducted. An autopsy is a \u201ccompelling public necessity\u201d if it is needed to \u201cprotect[] against an immediate and substantial threat to the public health\u201d or to assist law enforcement in conducting a murder investigation. R.C. 313.131.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">{\u00b6 59} Although autopsy reports are sometimes relevant in criminal prosecutions, <em>Craig </em>rightly held that they are not created primarily for a prosecutorial purpose. Consistent with <em>Craig, </em>other courts have held that coroners are statutorily empowered to investigate unnatural deaths and authorized to perform autopsies in a number of situations, only one of which is when a death is potentially a homicide. <em>People v. Leach, </em>405 Ill.App.3d 297, 308-309, 345 Ill.Dec. 694, 939 N.E.2d 537 (2010), <em>affd, </em>2012 IL 111534, 366 Ill.Dec. 477, 980 N.E.2d 570; <em>Dungo, </em>55 Cal.4th 608, 147 Cal.Rptr.3d 527, 286 P.3d 442 (testimony by a chief medical examiner who did not prepare the decedent\u2019s autopsy report was admissible); <em>United States v. James, </em>712 F.3d 79, 97 (2d Cir.2013) (autopsy report was to be considered on whether it was \u201cprepared with the primary purpose of creating a record for use at a later trial\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">{\u00b6 60} Ohio courts of appeals have also continued to uphold the admissibility of autopsy reports prepared by nontestifying medical examiners since <em>Melendez-Diaz. State v. Hardin, </em>193 Ohio App.3d 666, 2010-Ohio-6304, 953 N.E.2d 847, \u00b6 9-20 (4th Dist.) (autopsy report prepared by nontestifying medical examiner admissible as a nontestimonial business record, since it was not prepared for purposes of litigation); <em>State v. Zimmerman, </em>8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 96210, 2011-Ohio-6156, 2011 WL 5997588, \u00b6 43-45 (admissibility of autopsy report prepared by nontestifying medical examiner does not conflict with <em>Bullcoming)-, State v. Adams, </em>7th Dist. Mahoning No. 08 MA 246, 2012-Ohio-2719, 2012 WL 2308131, \u00b6 20, 26 <em>(Craig </em>still controls and autopsy report is nontestimonial evidence under <em>Crawford, </em>as it is not made solely at the behest of police in order to convict the particular defendant); <em>State v. Monroe, </em>8th Dist. Cuyahoga No. 94768, 2011-Ohio-3045, 2011 WL 2476280 <em>(Craig </em>not in conflict with <em>Melendez-Diaz).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b133-8\">{\u00b6 61} As a final matter, the admissibility of autopsy reports completed by a nontestifying medical examiner presents unique policy interests that are not present in other Crawford-related evidentiary matters. A medical examiner who conducted an autopsy may be unavailable or deceased when a trial begins. And unlike other forensic tests, a second autopsy may not be possible due to cremation of the victim\u2019s body or other loss of evidence with passage of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-9\">{\u00b6 62} Under R.C. 313.09, coroners are required to \u201ckeep a complete record of and * * * fill in the cause of death on the death certificate, in all cases coming <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>under [their] jurisdiction.\u201d Moreover, the scope of an examiner\u2019s duty is the same regardless of whether criminal activity is suspected or not. The Illinois Supreme Court has recognized that in some instances, police may compel the conducting of an autopsy during investigation of a cold case for later use at trial, and in that event the autopsy may play a testimonial role. <em>People v. Leach, </em>2012 IL 111534, 366 Ill.Dec. 477, 980 N.E.2d 570, \u00b6 133. The dissent rejects the primary-purpose test and would hold that whether a particular autopsy report is testimonial should be determined on a case-by-case basis. But generally, autopsy reports are neither (1) prepared for the primary purpose of accusing a targeted individual nor (2) prepared for the primary purpose of providing evidence in a criminal trial. For Sixth Amendment purposes, it is only the <em>primary </em>purpose of a document that determines whether it is testimonial or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">{\u00b6 63} <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>and <em>Bullcoming, </em>on which Maxwell relies, are readily distinguishable here. In both cases, the forensic reports were made at the request of police, for specific \u201cevidentiary purposes\u201d in order to aid in a police investigation. The record does not show that to be the case here. We hold that an autopsy report that is neither prepared for the primary purpose of accusing a targeted individual nor prepared for the primary purpose of providing evidence in a criminal trial is nontestimonial, and its admission into evidence at trial under Evid.R. 803(6) as a business record does not violate a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment confrontation rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">{\u00b6 64} Finally, the state argues that any error in admitting Dr. Felo\u2019s testimony and the autopsy report constitutes harmless error beyond a reasonable doubt, an issue we must determine. <em>See Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967). Even if there was error in admitting the coroner\u2019s testimony and the autopsy report, as discussed later in proposition XIII, overwhelming evidence was introduced that established Maxwell\u2019s guilt, and expert testimony was not crucial in proving the cause and manner of Nichole\u2019s death. Eyewitness testimony established that Maxwell shot Nichole in the head, and two .25-caliber shell casings were found inside the house after Maxwell fled the scene. Maxwell also admitted to Gregg that he shot Nichole twice. Finally, Michelle Kenney testified that Nichole died a short time after arriving at the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">{\u00b6 65} We will now address the remaining issues in the approximate order that they arose during the trial proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-8\">\n<em>A. Pretrial and trial issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AB\">1. <em>Amendment of the indictment </em>(Proposition of law II)</p>\n<p id=\"b134-9\">{\u00b6 66} Maxwell argues that the trial court erred by allowing the prosecutor to amend the indictment without engaging in a colloquy with the defendant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>ensure that he knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his right to a grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">{\u00b6 67} At the beginning of trial, the prosecutor sought to amend pursuant to Crim.R. 7(D) the specification that accompanied Counts One and Two that the murder occurred to escape the accounting for a crime. The specification stated, \u201cThe offender committed the offense presented above for the purpose of escaping punishment for another offense committed by him, to-wit: Rape.\u201d The prosecutor stated that there was a typographical error and that the specification should state \u201cfelonious assault\u201d instead of \u201crape.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">{\u00b6 68} The defense did not object to amending the specifications. Defense counsel stated, \u201cThe prosecutor raised this issue with me * * * several pretrials ago. I had an opportunity to speak to Mr. Maxwell with regards to this. I explained to him certainly we have no objection to this, and he agrees with me in terms of that, and certainly the county prosecutor can, of course, take this back to the Grand Jury to correct the typographical error, if he wishes to do so.\u201d The prosecutor was then allowed to amend the specification. Because Maxwell failed to object to the amendment, he has waived all but plain error. <em>See State v. Rohrbaugh, </em>126 Ohio St.3d 421, 2010-Ohio-3286, 934 N.E.2d 920, \u00b6 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-7\">{\u00b6 69} Under Crim.R. 7(D), a court may amend an indictment \u201cat any time\u201d if the amendment does not change \u201cthe name or identity of the crime charged.\u201d An amendment that changes the penalty or degree of the charged offense changes the identity of the offense and is not permitted by Crim.R. 7(D). <em>State v. Davis, 121 </em>Ohio St.3d 239, 2008-Ohio-4537, 903 N.E.2d 609, syllabus. However, \u201c[a]s long as the state complies \"with Crim.R. 7(D), it may cure a defective indictment by amendment, even if the original indictment omits an essential element of the offense with which the defendant is charged.\u201d <em>State v. Pepka, </em>125 Ohio St.3d 124, 2010-Ohio-1045, 926 N.E.2d 611, \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">{\u00b6 70} The amendment to the R.C. 2929.04(A)(3) specification changed the underlying offense from rape to felonious assault. This amendment changed the elements of the specification, because proof of the defendant\u2019s commission of the prior offense constituted an essential element of the R.C. 2929.04(A)(3) specification. <em>See State v. Jones, </em>91 Ohio St.3d 335, 347, 744 N.E.2d 1163 (2001). But the name of the crime of aggravated murder was not changed; Maxwell was still charged with an R.C. 2929.04(A)(3) death-penalty specification. The amended specification also did not change the penalty or degree of the offense charged. Thus, the trial court committed no plain error in granting the state\u2019s motion to amend the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">{\u00b6 71} Nevertheless, Maxwell argues that the trial court did not comply with Crim.R. 7(A), because he did not properly waive his right to have the grand jury amend the indictment. Yet Maxwell was prosecuted by indictment and was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>sufficiently informed of the charges in the indictment. Therefore, Crim.R. 7(A) and its waiver requirements do not apply to this case. <em>See Rohrbaugh, </em>126 Ohio St.3d 421, 2010-Ohio-3286, 934 N.E.2d 920, at \u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">{\u00b6 72} Maxwell invokes <em>State v. Colon, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 26, 2008-Ohio-1624, 885 N.E.2d 917, <em>overruled by State v. Homer, </em>126 Ohio St.3d 466, 2010-Ohio-3830, 935 N.E.2d 26, \u00b6 45, in arguing that he had the right to have the grand jury hear and consider the essential facts underlying the amendment of the specification. In <em>Colon, </em>this court held that the omission of a mens rea allegation in the indictment was a structural defect that rendered the conviction improper. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 19. Maxwell fails to explain how this holding applies to this case. Moreover, after Maxwell raised the issue in his first brief, this court overruled <em>Colon </em>in <em>Homer. </em>Thus, we reject this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">{\u00b6 73} Finally, even if the amended indictment were defective, it made no difference to the case outcome because the trial court merged the R.C. 2929.04(A)(3) specification with the murder-in-retaliation specification in R.C. 2929.04(A)(8) before the jury considered its penalty-phase verdict. We overrule proposition II.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">2. <em>Ineffective assistance of counsel </em>(Proposition of law IV)</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">{\u00b6 74} Maxwell argues that his counsel provided ineffective assistance during jury selection and by failing to object to victim-impact evidence during the guilt phase of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">{\u00b6 75} Reversal of a conviction for ineffective assistance requires that the defendant show, first, that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and, second, that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense so as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial. <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). <em>Accord State v. Bradley, </em>42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373 (1989), paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-10\">{\u00b6 76} Maxwell first argues that trial counsel\u2019s performance must be judged by the standards set forth in the American Bar Association (\u201cABA\u201d) <em>Guidelines for the Appointment and Performance of Defense Counsel in Death Penalty Cases </em>(Rev.Ed.2003). The stated objective of the guidelines is \u201cto set forth a national standard of practice for the defense of capital cases in order to ensure high quality legal representation for all persons facing the possible imposition or execution of a death sentence by any jurisdiction.\u201d Guideline 1.1(A). To this end, the ABA guidelines present a detailed prescription for the legal representation of capital defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-11\">{\u00b6 77} However, the Supreme Court has held that the ABA guidelines are \u201conly guides\u201d to what reasonableness means, not its definition. <em>Strickland </em>at 688. In <em>Bobby v. Van Hook, </em>558 U.S. 4, 130 S.Ct. 13, 175 L.Ed.2d 255 (2009), the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>Supreme Court reversed a Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals decision that relied on the ABA guidelines to grant a capital defendant relief on the ground that his lawyers performed deficiently in investigating and presenting mitigating evidence. The Supreme Court criticized the Sixth Circuit for treating the guidelines \u201cnot merely as evidence of what reasonably diligent attorneys would do, but as inexorable commands with which all capital defense counsel \u2018 \u201cmust fully comply.\u201d \u2019 <em>\u201d Id. </em>at 8, quoting <em>Van Hook v. Anderson, </em>560 F.3d 523, 526 (6th Cir.2009), quoting <em>Dickerson v. Bagley, </em>453 F.3d 690, 693 (6th Cir.2006). The Supreme Court continued, \u201c ![W]hile States are free to impose whatever specific rules they see fit to ensure that criminal defendants are well represented, we have held that the Federal Constitution imposes one general requirement: that counsel make objectively reasonable choices.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 9, quoting <em>Roe v. Flores-Ortega, </em>528 U.S. 470, 479, 120 S.Ct. 1029, 145 L.Ed.2d 985 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">{\u00b6 78} Accordingly, trial counsel\u2019s performance is reviewed under the two-prong <em>Strickland </em>analysis. <em>See also State v. Hunter, </em>131 Ohio St.3d 67, 2011-Ohio-6524, 960 N.E.2d 955, \u00b6 37-40. We now address Maxwell\u2019s specific assertions of ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">a. Improper use of peremptory challenges</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">{\u00b6 79} Maxwell argues that his counsel were ineffective by improperly using peremptory challenges to eliminate women from the jury, in violation of <em>Batson v. Kentucky, </em>476 U.S. 79, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d-69 (1986), and <em>J.E.B. v. Alabama ex rel. T.B., </em>511 U.S. 127, 114 S.Ct. 1419, 128 L.Ed.2d 89 (1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">{\u00b6 80} In <em>Batson, </em>the United States Supreme Court held that the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution precludes purposeful discrimination by the state in the exercise of its peremptory challenges so as to exclude members of minority groups from service on petit juries. <em>Id. </em>at 89. A court adjudicates a <em>Batson </em>claim in three steps. <em>State v. Were, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 448, 2008-Ohio-2762, 890 N.E.2d 263, \u00b6 61. First the opponent of the peremptory challenge must make a prima facie case of racial discrimination. Second, if the trial court finds this requirement fulfilled, the proponent of the challenge must provide a racially neutral explanation for the challenge. <em>Batson </em>at 96-98. Finally, the trial court must decide based on all the circumstances whether the opponent has proved purposeful racial discrimination. <em>Id. </em>at 98.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-10\">{\u00b6 81} <em>Batson </em>has since been extended to defense peremptory challenges, <em>Georgia v. McCollum, </em>505 U.S. 42, 112 S.Ct. 2348, 120 L.Ed.2d 33 (1992), and gender-based peremptory challenges, <em>J.E.B. </em>at 144-145.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>{\u00b6 82} Maxwell argues that trial counsel violated the equal-protection rights of five female prospective jurors by peremptorily challenging them: Juanita Gibson, Gail Gibson-Gray, Fahtema Stephens, Carol Dardzinski, and Genevieve Torrero. Gibson, Gibson-Gray, and Stephens were also African-American. During jury selection, defense counsel peremptorily challenged Gibson and stated that she was excused \u201cbecause of the tragedies that have occurred in her family.\u201d Counsel did not make any comments with respect to his peremptory challenge of the other four female prospective jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">{\u00b6 83} Maxwell concedes that the voir dire responses of Gibson, Gibson-Gray, and Stephens provided gender-neutral reasons for trial counsel\u2019s peremptory challenge. Maxwell notes that Gibson had been a victim of a sex offense, Gibson-Gray suffered from depression and had been hospitalized for a mental disease, and Stephens had been a victim of domestic violence. Maxwell provides no other argument to support his ineffectiveness claim regarding the peremptory challenge of these three prospective jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">{\u00b6 84} Maxwell\u2019s remaining argument is that trial counsel were ineffective in peremptorily challenging Dardzinski and Torrero. But the record includes no discussion of a possible basis for counsel\u2019s challenges of these two prospective jurors, because no <em>Batson </em>or <em>J.E.B. </em>objection was raised. Thus, from the record, we cannot determine whether trial counsel had racially neutral or gender-neutral explanations for the peremptory challenges and, if so, whether the trial court could have properly accepted such explanations as credible and not a pretext for racial or gender discrimination. Moreover, we cannot presume prejudice from trial counsel\u2019s failure to raise a <em>Batson </em>or <em>J.E.B. </em>challenge. <em>See State v. Burks, </em>10th Dist. Franklin No. 07AP-553, 2008-Ohio-2463, 2008 WL 2152670, \u00b6 57 (court unable to consider defense counsel\u2019s failure to raise a <em>Batson </em>objection on direct appeal because of an inadequate record).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">{\u00b6 85} Yet Dardzinski\u2019s and Torrero\u2019s responses on the jury questionnaires appear to provide gender-neutral explanations to support the defense\u2019s peremptory challenges. In response to the question \u201cWhat is your opinion of our Criminal Justice System?\u201d Dardzinski stated, \u201cThere are times it can be fair, but I also feel that if someone is convicted of a crime, sentencing is not harsh enough.\u201d When asked about her views on the death penalty, Dardzinski stated, \u201cI firmly believe in capital punishment. If someone can just go and kill someone I feel their life should be taken also.\u201d When Torrero was asked about her feelings about the death penalty, she responded simply, \u201cMy feelings, if you can\u2019t do the time don\u2019t commit the crime.\u201d Based on the foregoing, we hold that Maxwell has failed to establish that trial counsel were deficient by peremptorily challenging female prospective jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>b. Failure to life-quality prospective jurors</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">{\u00b6 86} Maxwell argues that trial counsel were ineffective by failing to \u201clife-qualify\u201d a single prospective juror pursuant to <em>Morgan v. Illinois, </em>504 U.S. 719, 112 S.Ct. 2222, 119 L.Ed.2d 492 (1992). <em>Morgan </em>held that on voir dire, upon the defendant\u2019s request, the trial court must inquire into the prospective juror\u2019s views on capital punishment because a prospective juror who would always impose the death penalty must not be empaneled. <em>Id. </em>at 729-734. In the present case, the trial court received assurances from all of the seated and alternate jurors that they could vote for one of the life sentences if the state failed to prove that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating factors. Thus, counsel were not deficient by failing to also question the jurors about this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">c. Failure to object to characterization of the verdict as a recommendation</p>\n<p id=\"b139-7\">{\u00b6 87} Maxwell argues that trial counsel were ineffective by failing to object to the trial court\u2019s instructions indicating that the jury verdict was merely a recommendation, in violation of <em>Caldwell v. Mississippi, </em>472 U.S. 320, 105 S.Ct. 2633, 86 L.Ed.2d 231 (1985). But counsel did object to those instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-8\">{\u00b6 88} Moreover, there was no <em>Caldwell </em>violation. In <em>Caldwell, </em>the jury did not receive an accurate description of its role in the sentencing process due to the prosecutor\u2019s suggestion that the jury\u2019s decision to impose the death penalty would not be final, because the appellate court would review the sentence for correctness. <em>Id. </em>at 328-329. The court concluded that the comment unconstitutionally \u201cled [the jury] to believe that the responsibility for determining the appropriateness of the defendant\u2019s death rests elsewhere.\u201d <em>Id. </em>But when a defendant claims that a <em>Caldwell </em>violation occurred, he or she \u201cmust show that the remarks to the jury improperly described the role assigned to the jury by local law.\u201d <em>Dugger v. Adams, </em>489 U.S. 401, 407, 109 S.Ct. 1211, 103 L.Ed.2d 435 (1989). No <em>Caldwell </em>violation occurred in the present case, since the trial court\u2019s instructions accurately stated the law, emphasized the jury\u2019s responsibility to impose a sentence, and did not induce reliance on the prospect of appellate review. <em>See State v. Hughbanks, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 365, 2003-Ohio-4121, 792 N.E.2d 1081, \u00b6 102.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-9\">d. Failure to object to victim-impact testimony</p>\n<p id=\"b139-10\">{\u00b6 89} Maxwell argues that trial counsel were ineffective by failing to object to victim-impact testimony that was presented at trial. Maxwell also challenges the introduction of this evidence in proposition of law X. But as discussed in that proposition, trial counsel were not ineffective by failing to object to this evidence, because its admission was either proper or not prejudicial.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-11\">{\u00b6 90} Based on the foregoing, we reject proposition IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>3. <em>Jury challenges </em>(Propositions of law V and VI)</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">{\u00b6 91} In proposition of law V, Maxwell argues that the trial court had an obligation to determine sua sponte whether trial counsel had gender-neutral reasons to peremptorily challenge five female prospective jurors. Maxwell failed to assert a <em>J.E.B. </em>challenge at trial and thus waived all but plain error. <em>See State v. Ballew, </em>76 Ohio St.3d 244, 253, 667 N.E.2d 369 (1996) (failure to raise a <em>Batson </em>challenge constituted waiver).</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">{\u00b6 92} In raising a <em>J.E.B. </em>challenge, \u201ca party alleging gender discrimination must make a prima facie showing of intentional discrimination before the party exercising the challenge is required to explain the basis for the strike.\u201d <em>J.E.B., </em>511 U.S. at 144-145, 114 S.Ct. 1419, 128 L.Ed.2d 89. Without an objection from either defense counsel or the prosecutor, the trial court had no obligation to raise a <em>J.E.B. </em>challenge on its own motion. Moreover, the record includes no discussion of a possible basis for counsel\u2019s challenges, because a <em>J.E.B. </em>issue was never raised. In the absence of an adequate record, we find that no plain error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">{\u00b6 93} In proposition of law VI, Maxwell argues that the trial court erred in denying a defense challenge against juror Gibson because she was biased. Maxwell also argues that he suffered prejudice because he was forced to use a peremptory challenge against Gibson after the trial court denied the challenge for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">{\u00b6 94} A trial court has broad discretion in determining a prospective juror\u2019s ability to be impartial. <em>State v. White, </em>82 Ohio St.3d 16, 20, 693 N.E.2d 772 (1998). Former R.C. 2313.42(J) (now R.C. 2313.17(B)(9)) stated that good cause exists for the removal of a prospective juror when \u201che discloses by his answers that he cannot be a fair and impartial juror or will not follow the law as given to him by the court.\u201d A prospective juror who has been challenged for cause should be excused \u201cif the court has any doubt as to the juror\u2019s being entirely unbiased.\u201d Former R.C. 2313.43 (now R.C. 2313.17(D)); <em>see State v. Cornwell, </em>86 Ohio St.3d 560, 563, 715 N.E.2d 1144 (1999). A trial court\u2019s ruling on a challenge for cause will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b140-9\">{\u00b6 95} During voir dire, juror Gibson stated that she had been sexually assaulted about five years previously and that her assailant had been recently apprehended. Gibson did not have to testify against the defendant, because there was a plea bargain and he received a one-year sentence. Gibson stated that she had met with Carol Skutnik of the Cuyahoga County prosecutor\u2019s office once or twice before trial. As to her dealings with the prosecutor\u2019s office, Gibson stated, \u201cThey did everything the way they were supposed to I believe. I didn\u2019t have any issues with them.\u201d As a follow-up question, trial counsel asked Gibson about her experience with the prosecutor\u2019s office: .\u201cDo you think that\u2019s going to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>somehow possibly taint the way you view this case against my client?\u201d Gibson responded, \u201cWhy would it? No, I don\u2019t. One has nothing to do with [the] other.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">{\u00b6 96} Maxwell argues that juror Gibson should have been excused as a juror because she had been the victim of a sexual assault and her previous relationship with the prosecutor\u2019s office posed a risk that she would find the prosecutor\u2019s case against Maxwell more credible. Yet Gibson\u2019s answers showed that she would be a fair-minded juror. Nothing indicates that Gibson\u2019s experiences as a sexual-assault victim would cause her to be biased against Maxwell. Gibson also assured the court that her prior dealings with a different Cuyahoga County prosecutor would not influence her consideration of Maxwell\u2019s case. <em>See State v. Allen, </em>73 Ohio St.3d 626, 629, 653 N.E.2d 675 (1995) (prospective juror whose brother was a homicide victim permitted to remain as capital juror after assuring the court that she could set that aside and remain impartial). Thus, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting this challenge for cause. We also reject Maxwell\u2019s contention that the defense was forced to use a peremptory challenge against Gibson.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">{\u00b6 97} Based on the foregoing, we overrule propositions V and VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">4. <em>Competency of child witness </em>(Proposition of law III)</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">{\u00b6 98} Maxwell argues that the trial court erred in finding that C.M. was competent to testify at trial. He argues that the record fails to establish that C.M. was able to distinguish right from wrong and understand the difference between the truth and a lie.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-8\">{\u00b6 99} Evid.R. 601 provides: \u201cEvery person is competent to be a witness except: (A) * * * children under ten years of age, who appear incapable of receiving just impressions of the facts and transactions respecting which they are examined, or of relating them truly.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b141-9\">{\u00b6 100} A trial court must conduct a voir dire examination of a child under ten years of age to determine the child\u2019s competence to testify. In making this determination, the court must consider</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-10\">(1) the child\u2019s ability to receive accurate impressions of fact or to observe acts about which he or she will testify, (2) the child\u2019s ability to recollect those impressions or observations, (3) the child\u2019s ability to communicate what was observed, (4) the child\u2019s understanding of truth and falsity and (5) the child\u2019s appreciation of his or her responsibility to be truthful.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-11\"><em>State v. Frazier, </em>61 Ohio St.3d 247, 251, 574 N.E.2d 483 (1991). A determination of competency is within the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be reversed on appeal absent a clear abuse of discretion. <em>Id. </em>at 250-251.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>{\u00b6 101} C.M. was five years old when she testified. She was one day short of her fourth birthday when she witnessed her mother being killed. During the voir dire examination to determine her competency, C.M. stated the name of her brother and sister and mentioned that she attended preschool and knew her teacher\u2019s name. She stated that her favorite TV show was \u201cSponge Bob\u201d and named the characters on the show and mentioned their characteristics. C.M. also identified photographs of the different rooms in her house. C.M. showed that she knew what it meant to tell the truth and stated, \u201cYou will get in trouble\u201d if you tell a lie. Finally, C.M. related what happened the night her mother was killed. C.M. stated that her \u201cdaddy\u201d came to the house with a gun, that he was in her \u201cMommy room,\u201d and that the three of them went downstairs. Asked what Maxwell did with the gun, she stated, \u201cHe shoot my mommy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">{\u00b6 102} Following voir dire, the trial court stated, \u201c[C.M.] is capable of receiving just impressions, she understands the importance of telling the truth, and, therefore, the Court rules that she will be allowed to testify. She\u2019s competent as a witness in this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">{\u00b6 103} Maxwell argues that the trial court abused its discretion because nothing shows that C.M. understood the significance of upholding the oath or the consequences of lying under oath. However, trial counsel objected to C.M.\u2019s competency on the grounds that she was unable to adequately recall \u201cmaterial facts and impressions,\u201d rather than her lack of understanding of the significance of an oath. Evid.R. 103(A) requires that an objection state the specific grounds upon which it based. Thus, Maxwell\u2019s objection to C.M.\u2019s competency on different grounds than he now complains about constitutes waiver absent a showing of plain error. <em>See State v. Wade, </em>53 Ohio St.2d 182, 188, 373 N.E.2d 1244 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">{\u00b6 104} C.M. was not asked whether she understood the significance of taking an oath or lying under oath. But a child \u201cneed not have religious beliefs or detailed knowledge of the nature of the oath.\u201d <em>State v. Eastham, </em>39 Ohio St.3d 307, 313, 530 N.E.2d 409 (1988) (Brown, J., concurring). Rather, \u201cit must be shown that the child understands the duty to tell the truth and that some punishment will follow if the child fails to tell the truth.\u201d <em>Id. </em>C.M. demonstrated that she understood the concept of truthfulness and knew that there were consequences for not telling the truth during voir dire:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-8\">Q. And, [C.M.], do you know the difference between telling the truth and telling a lie?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b142-9\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>Q. And what\u2019s the difference?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-6\">A. The difference, when you don\u2019t tell the truth\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-7\">Q. Uh-huh?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-8\">A. \u2014you could get in trouble.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-9\">Q. Okay. And if you tell the truth, what happens? Is it good to tell the truth?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-10\">A. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-11\">Q. Okay. What happens if you tell a lie?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-12\">A. You will get in trouble.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b143-13\">{\u00b6 105} Thus, the record supports the trial court\u2019s finding that C.M. understood the importance of telling the truth in finding that she was competent. Moreover, we do not find an abuse of discretion simply because C.M. was only five years old at the time of trial. <em>See State v. Fry, </em>125 Ohio St.3d 163, 2010-Ohio-1017, 926 N.E.2d 1239, \u00b6 73-87 (child witness who was six years old at trial and five years old when he witnessed the murder competent to testify); <em>State v. Allard, </em>75 Ohio St.3d 482, 496-497, 663 N.E.2d 1277 (1996) (child eyewitness to two murders who was five years old at trial and four years old when he witnessed the murders competent to testify).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-14\">{\u00b6 106} As an alternative argument, Maxwell claims that the trial court abused its discretion in finding C.M. competent because her testimony showed she was confused and unable to accurately relate her observations. During cross-examination, C.M. stated that she sometimes went horseback riding with her father in the house. Maxwell claims that he went horseback riding with real horses and not pretend horses and that C.M.\u2019s answers showed her confusion and possible fantasy.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-15\">{\u00b6 107} Maxwell incorrectly asserts that this testimony was presented during the competency hearing. Instead, C.M.\u2019s cross-examination about horseback riding occurred during the state\u2019s ease-in-chief. Once C.M. was deemed competent to testify, her credibility, like that of any other witness, must be determined by the trier of fact. 1 Giannelli, <em>Evidence, </em>Section 601.6, at 433 (3d Ed.2010). Thus, we reject Maxwell\u2019s claim that this segment of C.M.\u2019s cross-examination shows that C.M. was incompetent.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-16\">{\u00b6 108} In conclusion, we hold that the trial court committed no plain error in finding that C.M. was competent to testify. Proposition III is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-17\">5. Miranda <em>compliance </em>(Proposition of law XIII)</p>\n<p id=\"b143-18\">{\u00b6 109} Maxwell argues that the trial court erred in admitting his statements to police at the time of his arrest, because the police had failed to advise him of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>his <em>Miranda </em>rights before questioning him. <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">{\u00b6 110} Before trial, Maxwell moved to suppress statements that he made in response to police questioning about whether he was armed at the time of his arrest. During the suppression hearing, Agent Robert Riddlebarger testified that on December 16, 2005, he and six other members of the Cleveland/Cuyahoga County Fugitive/Gang Task Force went to a home on Jeffries Avenue in Cleveland to arrest Maxwell. Task-force members entered the house after knocking on the door and not receiving a response. According to Riddlebarger, the task force was \u201clooking for persons, or * * * anything that might be used as a weapon against us.\u201d The team members searched the basement and the first-floor area and found nothing. The entire task force then went upstairs to clear the second floor. The team members separated and searched the two bedrooms on that floor.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">{\u00b6 111} Team members cleared both bedrooms. In one bedroom, team members noticed a crawl-space door behind the bed. They moved the bed, opened the door, and found Maxwell. Riddlebarger and Det. Zickes pulled Maxwell out of the crawl space, placed him face down on the bed, and handcuffed him. Riddlebarger testified, \u201cAt about the same time as he\u2019s handcuffed, * * * Detective Zickes asked Mr. Maxwell whether or not he was armed.\u201d Maxwell responded that \u201che did not have a gun anymore.\u201d Riddlebarger then patted Maxwell down for weapons and searched his clothing to make sure that he did not have any weapons on him. Diming the pat-down, Maxwell stated that he \u201chad gotten rid of the gun that he once had.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">{\u00b6 112} The trial court overruled the defense motion to suppress Maxwell\u2019s statements. The court stated, \u201cIn this case, as in <em>[New York v. Quarles, </em>467 U.S. 649, 659, 104 S.Ct. 2626, 81 L.Ed.2d 550 (1984)], there was a public safety exception to the requirement that Miranda warnings be given before a subject\u2019s answers could be admitted into evidence * * Later, Riddlebarger testified during the state\u2019s case-in-chief regarding Maxwell\u2019s statements at the time of his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">{\u00b6 113} Under <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 444, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694, \u201cthe prosecution may not use statements, whether exculpatory or inculpatory, stemming from custodial interrogation of the defendant unless it demonstrates the use of procedural safeguards effective to secure the privilege against self-incrimination.\u201d However, when officers ask \u201cquestions necessary to secure their own safety or the safety of the public\u201d as opposed to \u201cquestions designed solely to elicit testimonial evidence from a suspect,\u201d they do not need to provide the warnings required by <em>Miranda. New York v. Quarles, </em>467 U.S. 649, 659, 104 S.Ct. 2626, 81 L.Ed.2d 550 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>{\u00b6 114} In <em>Quarles, </em>the police apprehended a rape suspect in a supermarket and discovered that he was wearing an empty shoulder holster. Before reading <em>Miranda </em>rights to the suspect, an officer asked the suspect where the gun was located. The suspect nodded toward some empty cartons and stated, \u201c[T]he gun is over there.\u201d <em>Quarles </em>at 652. In upholding the admissibility of the defendant\u2019s statement, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-6\">The police in this case * * * were confronted with the immediate necessity of ascertaining the whereabouts of a gun which they had every reason to believe the suspect had just removed from his empty holster and discarded in the supermarket. So long as the gun was concealed somewhere in the supermarket, with its actual whereabouts unknown, it obviously posed more than one danger to the public safety: an accomplice might make use of it, a customer or employee might later come upon it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 657.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">{\u00b6 115} Recognizing a narrow exception to the <em>Miranda </em>rule, <em>Quarles </em>reasoned that \u201cthe need for answers to questions in a situation posing a threat to the public safety outweighs the need for the prophylactic rule protecting the Fifth Amendment\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In so holding, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b145-9\">We decline to place officers * * * in the untenable position of having to consider, often in a matter of seconds, whether it best serves society for them to ask the necessary questions without the <em>Miranda </em>warnings and render whatever probative evidence they uncover inadmissible, or for them to give the warnings in order to preserve the admissibility of evidence they might uncover but possibly damage or destroy their ability to obtain that evidence and neutralize the volatile situation confronting them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b145-10\"><em>Id. </em>at 657-658. <em>Quarles </em>indicated that this limited exception will not be difficult for police officers to apply \u201cbecause in each case it will be circumscribed by the exigency which justifies it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 658.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-11\">{\u00b6 116} Maxwell argues that <em>Quarles </em>did not justify the police questioning him about whether he was armed without first advising him of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Maxwell argues that he was handcuffed before he was asked about the weapon. He also argues that the public-safety exception does not apply, because he was arrested inside a private home that had been completely secured by the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-12\">{\u00b6 117} In <em>United States v. Williams, </em>483 F.3d 425, 428 (6th Cir.2007), the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit set forth the standard that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>the government must satisfy in order for custodial statements made before any <em>Miranda </em>warnings to be admissible under the <em>Quarles </em>public-safety exception. \u201cFor an officer to have a reasonable belief that he is in danger,\u201d and thus for the exception to apply, \u201che must have reason to believe (1) that the defendant might have (or recently have had) a weapon, and (2) that someone other than police might gain access to that weapon and inflict harm with it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 428. <em>Williams </em>stated that this evaluation of the applicability of the <em>Quarles </em>exception \u201ctakes into consideration a number of factors, which may include the known history and characteristics of the suspect, the known facts and circumstances of the alleged crime, and the facts and circumstances confronted by the officer when he undertakes the arrest.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">{\u00b6 118} In the present case, the first condition was satisfied because the members of the task force had a reasonable belief that Maxwell might possess a weapon. Evidence suggested that he possessed weapons and had recently shot Nichole. But the second condition was not met. When Maxwell was questioned, the task force had secured the premises, performed a sweep of the house, and determined that no one else was present. Maxwell was handcuffed and surrounded by several task-force members. The house was under full control of the agents during the questioning. These facts contrast with those of <em>Quarles, </em>in which a discarded gun in a supermarket presented a threat to public safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">{\u00b6 119} Nevertheless, the state argues that Det. Zickes could ask Maxwell whether or not he was armed because an officer\u2019s safety is <em>always </em>at risk, especially when the arrest occurs in the defendant\u2019s home. But the <em>Williams </em>test provides that in applying the <em>Quarles </em>exception, it is necessary to consider the facts and circumstances confronted by the police at the time of arrest, and here, nothing suggested that Maxwell might gain access to a weapon and inflict harm with it.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">{\u00b6 120} In <em>United States v. Kellogg, </em>306 Fed.Appx. 916 (6th Cir.2009), the court evaluated a similar fact situation involving the application of the public-safety exception. In <em>Kellogg, </em>the police asked the defendant, who was suspected of bank robbery, whether he had a gun or drugs on the premises before searching his home. <em>Id. </em>at 918. The court rejected claims that the public-safety exception allowed defendant\u2019s incriminating responses to be admitted at trial. The court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>stated that the suspicion that the defendant had recently committed a bank robbery satisfied the first prong of the <em>Williams </em>standard. <em>Id. </em>at 924. However, the court stated that the second prong of the <em>Williams </em>standard was not met:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-6\">[S]inee the arresting officers had just ordered all of the occupants out of the duplex, handcuffed Kellogg and conducted a security sweep of the residence, there was no reason to believe that a weapon would be immediately accessible to individuals other than police. Thus, the immediate danger to the officers or the public was insufficient to justify the officers\u2019 failure to inform Kellogg of his rights prior to eliciting incriminating statements regarding the items in the duplex.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-7\"><em>Id. See also United States v. Brathwaite, </em>458 F.3d 376, 382 (5th Cir.2006), fn. 8 (rejecting application of the public-safety exception where police secured the suspect and his coresidents, conducted two security sweeps, and gained control over the residence).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">{\u00b6 121} Maxwell made two statements after Det. Zickes asked him whether he was armed. His first statement, that he did not have a gun anymore, was in direct response to Zickes\u2019s question. His second statement, that \u201che got rid of the gun that he once had,\u201d was made while Riddlebarger was patting him down. Riddlebarger testified that this was an unsolicited response and was not made in response to further questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">{\u00b6 122} The admissibility of Maxwell\u2019s second statement depends on whether it was a continuation of his response to police questioning about whether he was armed. In determining whether one statement is a continuation of the previous statement, a court should consider factors such as whether the content in the statements overlap, the timing and setting of each statement, and the continuity of personnel. <em>See State v. Clark, </em>7th Dist. Mahoning No. 08MA15, 2009-Ohio-3328, 2009 WL 1915211, \u00b6 24. Maxwell\u2019s second response was made seconds after his first response, addressed the same matter, and was made to the same officers in the room. Thus, we conclude that both statements were improperly obtained in violation of <em>Miranda.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b147-10\">{\u00b6 123} Because Maxwell\u2019s statements were improperly admitted into evidence, we must determine whether the error was reversible or harmless. \u201cA constitutional error can be held harmless if we determine that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Conway, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 214, 2006-Ohio-791, 842 N.E.2d 996, \u00b6 78, citing <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967). We hold that the erroneous admission of Maxwell\u2019s statements was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt in view of the remaining evidence establishing Maxwell\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>{\u00b6 124} Properly admitted evidence provided overwhelming evidence of Maxwell\u2019s guilt. Gregg testified that Maxwell was very upset after Nichole testified at the grand jury and that he said, \u201c[T]he bitch is going to make me kill her.\u201d He also asked Gregg where he could get a gun. Four days later, Maxwell violated a temporary protection order and went to Nichole\u2019s house with a gun. Lauretta confronted Maxwell at the house, Maxwell fired shots, and she observed Maxwell standing over Nichole\u2019s body before he fled the scene. C.M. also witnessed Maxwell shooting her mother. Moreover, Maxwell called Gregg and admitted shooting Nichole that night.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">{\u00b6 125} Based on the foregoing, we overrule proposition XIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">6. <em>Admissibility of Nichole\u2019s phone conversation with Maxwell </em>(Proposition of law XIV)</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">{\u00b6 126} Maxwell argues that the trial court erred by admitting a segment of Nichole\u2019s telephone conversation with him, because it was inadmissible hearsay and violated his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">{\u00b6 127} On November 23, 2005, Nichole testified before the grand jury about the felonious assault. That evening, Maxwell called Gregg and told him that he had been trying to talk to Nichole about her grand jury testimony but had been unable to contact her. Maxwell then phoned Nichole while Gregg remained on the line, and Gregg heard their conversation. Gregg testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-9\">Q: And did Mr. Maxwell say anything to Ms. McCorkle?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-10\">A: Yes, he did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-11\">Q: What did he say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-12\">A: He asked her what had happened in court that day.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-13\">Q: Did she respond?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-14\">Mr. Luskin [defense counsel]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-15\">A: Yes, she did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-16\">The Court: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-17\">Q: What did she say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-18\">Mr. Rein [defense counsel]: Objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-19\">The Court: Overruled.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-20\">A: She had told him that \u2014 she was very sincere when she said it \u2014 but she said I told the truth. I had to tell the truth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-21\">Q: After she tells him that, how long after that \u2014 how long was the conversation all together?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b148-22\">A: A few minutes, not real long. Four or five minutes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>Q: Was there much conversation after she told him that she had to tell the truth?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-6\">A: No, there was not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">{\u00b6 128} Maxwell argues that Nichole\u2019s statement that she \u201ctold the truth\u201d was inadmissible hearsay and constituted a testimonial statement that violated the Confrontation Clause in violation of <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177. The state argues that Nichole\u2019s statement was not admitted for the truth of the matter asserted and was not a testimonial statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">{\u00b6 129} Out-of-court statements offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted are generally inadmissible as hearsay. Evid.R. 801 and 802. If a statement is not offered for the truth of the matter asserted, however, it is not prohibited by the hearsay rule and will be admissible, subject to the standards governing relevancy and undue prejudice. Evid.R. 402 and 403; <em>State v. LaMar, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 181, 2002-Ohio-2128, 767 N.E.2d 166, \u00b6 59. \u201cIt is well established that extrajudicial statements made by an out-of-court declarant are properly admissible to explain the actions of a witness to whom the statement was directed.\u201d <em>State v. Thomas, </em>61 Ohio St.2d 223, 232, 400 N.E.2d 401 (1980); <em>see also 2 </em>Giannelli, <em>Evidence, </em>Section 801.10, at 138 (3d Ed.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">{\u00b6 130} Nichole\u2019s statement that she testified truthfully before the grand jury was not offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted but to prove the effect of the statement on the listener, Maxwell. The statement was relevant because it set into motion the chain of events leading to the confrontation between Maxwell and Nichole and her shooting a few nights later. Thus, the trial court did not err in admitting Nichole\u2019s statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">{\u00b6 131} We also reject Maxwell\u2019s <em>Crawford </em>claim. In <em>Crawford, </em>the Supreme Court held that it is a violation of the Confrontation Clause to admit \u201ctestimonial statements of a witness who did not appear at trial unless he was unavailable to testify and the defendant had had a prior opportunity for cross-examination.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 53-54, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177. <em>Crawford </em>also stated that the Confrontation Clause \u201cdoes not bar the use of testimonial statements for purposes other than establishing the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 59, fn. 9, citing <em>Tennessee v. Street, </em>471 U.S. 409, 414, 105 S.Ct. 2078, 85 L.Ed.2d 425 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-11\">{\u00b6 132} Nichole\u2019s statement did not implicate Maxwell\u2019s confrontation rights. Nichole\u2019s out-of-court statement, repeated by Gregg, served the purpose of explaining how certain events came to pass or why Maxwell confronted and shot Nichole. <em>See United States v. Cromer, </em>389 F.3d 662, 676 (6th Cir.2004). Because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>the statements were not offered to establish the truth of the matter asserted, the Confrontation Clause did not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">{\u00b6 133} Based on the foregoing, we overrule proposition XIV.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">7. <em>Victim-impact testimony </em>(Proposition of law X)</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">{\u00b6 134} Maxwell argues that the trial court erred in admitting victim-impact testimony during the guilt phase of the trial. Except where noted, defense counsel failed to object to such evidence and thus waived all but plain error. <em>See State v. Reynolds, </em>80 Ohio St.3d 670, 679, 687 N.E.2d 1358 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">{\u00b6 135} \u201cEvidence relating to the facts attendant to the offense is \u2018clearly admissible\u2019 during the guilt phase, even though it might be characterized as victim-impact evidence.\u201d <em>State v. McKnight, </em>107 Ohio St.3d 101, 2005-Ohio-6046, 837 N.E.2d 315, \u00b6 98, quoting <em>State v. Fautenberry, </em>72 Ohio St.3d 435, 440, 650 N.E.2d 878 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">{\u00b6 136} First, Maxwell complains that Nichole\u2019s sister, Michelle Kenney, provided improper victim-impact testimony about family history and other personal matters. Michelle mentioned the names and ages of Nichole\u2019s children and her siblings and stated that Nichole had been married and divorced but kept her married name. Michelle also described the inside of Nichole\u2019s home at 1046 East 146th Street. Maxwell also complains that Michelle testified that Nichole wanted the women\u2019s biological father, Heinz Kenney, to move into her house after he was released from prison in July 2005 \u201cbecause he was sick and everything.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AIq\">{\u00b6 137} The testimony about Nichole\u2019s family and her divorce provided background information about Nichole\u2019s relationship with Maxwell and the witnesses who testified. Testimony about family members living at the house and information about the layout of the house showed the people who had access to the house and described where the shooting occurred. Moreover, none of this testimony was overly emotional. Thus, we hold that no plain error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">{\u00b6 138} Second, Maxwell contends that Michelle and Lauretta Kenney improperly testified about their frequent phone contact with Nichole. Michelle testified that she had daily contact with Nichole and talked with her on the phone every day. Lauretta also testified that she had daily contact with Nichole and spoke to her on the phone \u201c[f]our or five times a day.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b150-10\">{\u00b6 139} Maxwell also asserts that Michelle improperly testified that after the shooting, she went to the hospital and. saw Nichole \u201claying on an ambulance gurney * * * and she had all these tubes in her and she had a hose in her head and it was just blood everywhere.\u201d Michelle also mentioned that family members discussed the possibility that they might have to decide whether to continue Nichole on life support. However, Nichole died before that decision was necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>{\u00b6 140} Michelle\u2019s and Lauretta\u2019s frequent phone contact with Nichole was relevant in explaining their awareness of and involvement in the events leading up to Nichole\u2019s murder. Michelle\u2019s graphic description of Nichole\u2019s medical condition at the hospital and her testimony about the family discussion on discontinuing life support were of more questionable relevance. But we hold that no plain error resulted from admitting this testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">{\u00b6 141} Third, Maxwell argues that the prosecutor improperly had C.M. identify a photograph of her mother. However, Maxwell is incorrect. C.M. identified a photograph of the bloodstained carpet where her mother was lying after she had been shot. Nichole\u2019s body was not in the picture. Thus, we reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">{\u00b6 142} Finally, Maxwell complains that Dr. Joseph Felo, the chief deputy coroner for Cuyahoga County, improperly testified about the pain that Nichole must have suffered from one of the gunshot wounds. Dr. Felo testified that one of the gunshot wounds went through the right eyeball and that there would have been \u201cexcruciating pain associated with that.\u201d The trial court sustained a defense objection to this testimony and instructed the jury to disregard the answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">{\u00b6 143} Maxwell suffered no prejudice from Dr. Felo\u2019s testimony about pain that Nichole suffered, because the trial court instructed the jurors to disregard Dr. Felo\u2019s comments. <em>See State v. Heinish, </em>50 Ohio St.3d 231, 241, 553 N.E.2d 1026 (1990) (\u201cWhere a jury is cautioned and a correction is given to the jury, the effect of improper evidence may be cured\u201d). The trial court also sustained objections on two other occasions when Dr. Felo began to refer to the victim\u2019s pain.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">{\u00b6 144} Based on the foregoing, we overrule proposition X.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">8. <em>Sufficiency of the evidence </em>(Proposition of law VII)</p>\n<p id=\"b151-11\">a. Evidence of prior calculation and design</p>\n<p id=\"b151-12\">{\u00b6 145} Maxwell argues that the state failed to prove that he murdered Nichole with prior calculation and design as charged in Count One.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-13\">{\u00b6 146} When a court reviews a record for sufficiency, \u201c[t]he relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. J entes, </em>61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492 (1991), paragraph two of the syllabus, following <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979). \u201c[T]he weight to be given the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses are primarily for the trier of the facts.\u201d <em>State v. DeHass, </em>10 Ohio St.2d 230, 227 N.E.2d 212 (1967), paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>{\u00b6 147} Maxwell was convicted of one count of aggravated murder under R.C. 2903.01(A), which states: \u201cNo person shall purposely, and with prior calculation and design, cause the death of another * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">{\u00b6 148} No bright-line test exists that \u201cemphatically distinguishes between the presence or absence of \u2018prior calculation and design.\u2019 Instead, each case turns on the particular facts and evidence presented at trial.\u201d <em>State v. Taylor, </em>78 Ohio St.3d 15, 20, 676 N.E.2d 82 (1997). However, when the evidence presented at trial \u201creveals the presence of sufficient time and opportunity for the planning of an act of homicide to constitute prior calculation, and the circumstances surrounding the homicide show a scheme designed to implement the calculated decision to kill, a finding by the trier of fact of prior calculation and design is justified.\u201d <em>State v. Cotton, </em>56 Ohio St.2d 8, 381 N.E.2d 190 (1978), paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">{\u00b6 149} Maxwell argues that the evidence shows that he spontaneously shot Nichole after observing her with another man, kissing him goodnight, and receiving phone calls from him at home. Thus, Maxwell asserts that the evidence is insufficient to support a conviction of prior calculation and design.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">{\u00b6 150} Maxwell\u2019s argument overlooks the evidence showing that he shot Nichole in retaliation for her failure to change her grand jury testimony about the felonious assault. Gregg testified that at Maxwell\u2019s behest, he had contacted Nichole and asked her to \u201cstick to the story that it was a simple domestic\u201d incident when she testified before the grand jury. Nichole later told Maxwell that she had told the truth during her grand jury testimony. Maxwell then told Gregg that \u201cthe bitch was going to make him kill her\u201d and asked Gregg where he could get a gun. Maxwell went to Nichole\u2019s home and killed her four days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">{\u00b6 151} We have previously held that a defendant\u2019s threat to obtain a weapon and kill his victim and his later actions carrying out that threat are enough to prove prior calculation and design. <em>Conway, </em>108 Ohio St.3d 214, 2006-Ohio-791, 842 N.E.2d 996, at \u00b6 45; <em>State v. Sowell, </em>39 Ohio St.3d 322, 333, 530 N.E.2d 1294 (1988). Maxwell announced his intention to kill Nichole, and he never abandoned that plan. Moreover, according to Gregg\u2019s testimony, Maxwell told Gregg that when he shot Nichole \u201cshe fell down and * * * she moved and then he shot her again.\u201d The second gunshot belies Maxwell\u2019s argument that the murder was spontaneous, and his actions show that he was carrying out his stated intention to kill Nichole for testifying against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">{\u00b6 152} In <em>Fry, </em>125 Ohio St.3d 163, 2010-Ohio-1017, 926 N.E.2d 1239, we addressed a similar fact situation. On July 18, 2005, Fry and Tamela Hardison had a fight in the apartment where they lived. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 7. Hardison then filed charges against Fry for assault and aggravated menacing. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 148. While in pretrial custody, Fry told Hardison to go to court and drop the charges. On July <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>21, Fry told Hardison that he had received paperwork that she had signed saying that he had assaulted and threatened her. During that conversation, Fry told Hardison, \u201cI got two of them under my belt * * * toe tags,\u201d meaning that he had killed two people. He then told Hardison, \u201cFix this.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 150. Fry was released from jail on July 25 and killed Hardison on July 31. We upheld the sufficiency of the evidence and stated that there was sufficient time, reflection, and activity involved in Hardison\u2019s murder to show that Fry killed her with prior calculation and design. <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6 157.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">{\u00b6 153} Just as in <em>Fry, </em>Maxwell demanded that Nichole lie to the grand jury to have his charges reduced. Maxwell later learned that Nichole had told the truth during her grand jury testimony, and he then expressed his intent to kill Nichole. As in <em>Fry, </em>several days elapsed, and then Maxwell went to Nichole\u2019s house and killed her. Construing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, a rational juror could have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that Maxwell had formulated a plan to kill Nichole. Thus, we hold that there was sufficient time, reflection, and activity involved in Nichole\u2019s murder to show that Maxwell killed her with prior calculation and design.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">b. Evidence proving witness-murder specification (Proposition of law VIII)</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">{\u00b6 154} Maxwell argues that the state failed to prove his guilt on the witness-murder specification.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-9\">{\u00b6 155} Maxwell was convicted of the R.C. 2929.04(A)(8) death-penalty specification that the victim \u201cwas a witness to an offense and was purposely killed in retaliation for the victim\u2019s testimony in any criminal proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b153-10\">{\u00b6 156} Maxwell continues to argue that the evidence showed that he killed Nichole because he was upset with her for socializing with another man and kissing him goodnight. Maxwell asserts that this motive superseded evidence that he murdered Nichole in retaliation for her grand jury testimony. Thus, he argues that the evidence is insufficient to support an (A)(8) finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-11\">{\u00b6 157} As discussed in proposition of law VII, the evidence shows that Gregg, at Maxwell\u2019s behest, contacted Nichole and attempted to persuade her to change her grand jury testimony to obtain a charge reduction against Maxwell. Upon learning that Nichole did not change her testimony, Maxwell stated his intent to kill Nichole and asked Gregg where he could get a gun. Maxwell shot and killed Nichole four days later.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-12\">{\u00b6 158} Although the evidence supports a finding that Maxwell killed Nichole for testifying against him, the state was not required to prove that that was Maxwell\u2019s <em>sole </em>reason for killing Nichole. <em>Fry, </em>125 Ohio St.3d 163, 2010-Ohio-1017, 926 N.E.2d 1239, at \u00b6 153. Even assuming that jealousy was also a motive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>for the murder, we hold that the state presented sufficient evidence to prove the R.C. 2929.04(A)(8) specification.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-5\">c. Elements of witness-murder specification (Proposition of law IX)</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">{\u00b6 159} Maxwell maintains that the state failed to present sufficient evidence to prove the R.C. 2929.04(A)(8) specification, that he killed Nichole to prevent her \u201ctestimony in any criminal proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">{\u00b6 160} Nichole testified before the grand jury on Wednesday, November 23, 2005. According to Brian Mooney, Cuyahoga County assistant prosecutor at the time of the murder, the grand jury returned a true bill against Maxwell for felonious assault, abduction, and domestic violence on November 23. Because the next day was Thanksgiving, the indictment was not filed with the clerk of court until Monday, November 28, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">{\u00b6 161} Maxwell argues that the (A)(8) specification is inapplicable because the indictment for felonious assault was not filed until the day after the murder and no criminal proceeding was underway. In support of this argument, Maxwell cites R.C. 2901.13(E), which states, \u201cA prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an information filed * * *.\u201d He also cites Crim.R. 55(A), which states: \u201cAn action is commenced for purposes of this rule by the earlier of, (a) the filing of a complaint, * * * indictment, or information with the clerk, or (b) the receipt by the clerk of the court of common pleas of a bind over order under Rule 5(B)(4)(a).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b154-9\">{\u00b6 162} R.C. 2929.04(A)(8) does not require that a criminal action be pending when the defendant kills the witness. Indeed, a defendant can be charged with the witness-murder specification in situations in which no criminal proceeding has been initiated at the time the victim was murdered. <em>State v. Conway, </em>109 Ohio St.3d 412, 2006-Ohio-2815, 848 N.E.2d 810, \u00b6 55. The statute requires only (1) that the victim was a witness to an offense and (2) that the purpose of killing the witness was to prevent the victim from testifying in a criminal proceeding. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b154-10\">{\u00b6 163} As discussed above, the evidence established that Maxwell killed Nichole because she testified against him before the grand jury. Accordingly, we hold that Maxwell\u2019s guilt of the R.C. 2929.04(A)(8) specification was established by proof beyond a reasonable doubt even though the indictment for felonious assault was not filed until the day after Nichole\u2019s murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-11\">{\u00b6 164} Based on the foregoing, we reject propositions VII, VIII, and IX.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-12\">\n<em>B. Penalty-phase issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b154-13\">1. <em>Ineffective assistance of counsel </em>(Proposition of law I)</p>\n<p id=\"b154-14\">{\u00b6 165} Maxwell argues that his counsel failed to develop and present evidence of his mental retardation, failed to investigate and present mitigating evidence, and committed other errors during the penalty phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>a. Failure to present evidence of mental retardation</p>\n<p id=\"ACy2\">{\u00b6 166} Maxwell argues that trial counsel failed to properly develop evidence showing that he was mentally retarded and failed to request a hearing to determine whether he was mentally retarded pursuant to <em>Atkins v. Virginia, </em>536 U.S. 304, 122 S.Ct. 2242, 153 L.Ed.2d 335 (2002). He also argues that trial counsel faded to present such evidence during mitigation. Maxwell relies on evidence presented during his competency proceedings and testimony presented during the penalty phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">(1) <em>Facts</em></p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">{\u00b6 167} During the competency hearing, Dr. Michael Aronoff, a psychologist at the Court Psychiatric Clinic, testified that he had evaluated Maxwell and administered the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence. These test results showed that Maxwell had a full-scale IQ score of 72, which is in the borderline range. He also had a verbal IQ score of 68, which is in the range of mild mental retardation, and a performance IQ score of 83, which is in the low average range. Dr. Aronoff testified that earlier IQ test scores were not found in Maxwell\u2019s school records or any other records.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\">{\u00b6 168} Dr. Aronoff administered other tests, including the Competency Assessment to Stand Trial for Defendants with Mental Retardation (\u201cCAST*MR\u201d). Dr. Aronoff testified that Maxwell\u2019s low score on that test was significant \u201cbecause he didn\u2019t come up with a mentally retarded IQ score and he\u2019s had prior experience with the legal system.\u201d Due to the possibility of malingering on the CAST*MR, Dr. Aronoff recommended that Maxwell be referred to the court evaluation unit of the North Coast Behavioral Health Care System for a 20-day inpatient competency evaluation. The trial court ordered that Maxwell be referred for such treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-8\">{\u00b6 169} Dr. Alice Cook, a clinical psychologist, evaluated Maxwell during his inpatient treatment at North Coast. During the competency hearing, Dr. Cook testified that she performed no additional testing but was aware that Maxwell had attained a verbal IQ score of 68 during earlier testing. But Dr. Cook indicated that Maxwell was not mentally retarded. She stated, \u201cIn order to have a diagnoses of mental retardation, it needed to be identified prior to the age of 18, and there was no indication of any records from anyplace that he had been identified prior to age 18 as being mentally retarded.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b155-9\">{\u00b6 170} During the competency proceedings, defense counsel mentioned that Dr. John Fabian, a board-certified psychologist, had also met with Maxwell to assess his condition. Dr. Fabian was not called as a witness, and his assessment of Maxwell was never introduced. Following the competency hearing, the trial court ruled that Maxwell was competent to stand trial. Defense counsel present<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>ed no argument that Maxwell was mentally retarded and did not request an <em>Atkins </em>hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">{\u00b6 171} During the penalty phase, Dr. Sandra McPherson, a clinical psychologist, testified as a defense mitigation witness. Dr. McPherson evaluated Maxwell and administered the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale and wide-range achievement test. Dr. McPherson testified that Maxwell attained a full-scale IQ score of 84, which placed him in the low average range. Maxwell also attained a performance IQ score of 95 and a verbal IQ score of 77.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-5\">(2) <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b156-6\">{\u00b6 172} On June 20, 2002, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that the execution of a mentally retarded criminal violates the Eighth Amendment\u2019s ban on cruel and unusual punishments. <em>Atkins v. Virginia, </em>536 U.S. 304, 122 S.Ct. 2242, 153 L.Ed.2d 335. <em>Atkins </em>left to the states \u201c \u2018the task of developing appropriate ways to enforce the constitutional restriction\u2019 \u201d on executing the mentally retarded. <em>Id. </em>at 317, quoting <em>Ford v. Wainwright, </em>477 U.S. 399, 405, 416-417,106 S.Ct. 2595, 91 L.Ed.2d 335 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-7\">{\u00b6 173} In <em>State v. Lott, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 303, 2002-Ohio-6625, 779 N.E.2d 1011, this court developed procedures and substantive standards for resolving <em>Atkins </em>claims. <em>Lott </em>adopted a three-part test, which had been cited with approval in <em>Atkins </em>at 308, fn. 3, that defined mental retardation as (1) significantly subaverage intellectual functioning, (2) significant limitations in two or more adaptive skills, such as communication, self-care, and self-direction, and (3) onset before the age of 18. <em>Lott </em>at \u00b6 12. <em>Lott </em>went on to state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b156-8\">Most state statutes prohibiting the execution of the mentally retarded require evidence that the individual has an IQ of 70 or below. * * * While IQ tests are one of many factors that need to be considered, they alone are not sufficient to make a final determination on this issue. * * * We hold that there is a rebuttable presumption that a defendant is not mentally retarded if his or her IQ is above 70.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b156-9\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b156-10\">{\u00b6 174} First, Maxwell argues that trial counsel were ineffective by failing to request an <em>Atkins </em>hearing because IQ testing administered by Dr. Aronoff showed that he had a verbal IQ score of 68.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-11\">{\u00b6 175} In order for counsel\u2019s inadequate performance to constitute a Sixth Amendment violation, Maxwell must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and prejudiced him. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687,104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. <em>Strickland </em>requires that courts \u201capply[ ] a heavy measure of deference to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>counsel\u2019s judgments\u201d and \u201cindulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 691 and 689.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">{\u00b6 176} Maxwell fails to establish that trial counsel were deficient in failing to request an <em>Atkins </em>hearing. The results of two full-scale IQ tests showed that Maxwell\u2019s IQ was above 70. Dr. McPherson testified that Maxwell\u2019s IQ score was 84, which is significantly higher than the <em>Lott </em>cutoff level. There is also no evidence that Maxwell suffered \u201csignificant limitations in two or more adaptive skills.\u201d <em>Lott, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 303, 2002-Ohio-6625, 779 N.E.2d 1011, at \u00b6 2. Finally, Dr. Cook testified that Maxwell is not mentally retarded, because there was \u201cno indication\u201d of \u201cany records from anyplace that he had been identified prior to age 18 as being mentally retarded.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">{\u00b6 177} Maxwell argues that trial counsel were ineffective by allowing Maxwell to be retested after earlier testing had potentially excluded him from death eligibility. But Maxwell has not shown how Dr. McPherson\u2019s testing amounted to deficient performance. Dr. McPherson was an expert in this area, and she determined which tests to administer. <em>See State v. Leonard, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 54, 2004-Ohio-6235, 818 N.E.2d 229, \u00b6 150.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-8\">{\u00b6 178} Moreover, if trial counsel had requested an <em>Atkins </em>hearing, the trial court would have conducted a de novo review of the evidence in determining whether the defendant was mentally retarded. <em>See Lott </em>at \u00b6 18. <em>Lott </em>states, \u201cThe trial court should rely on professional evaluations of [a defendant\u2019s] mental status, and consider expert testimony, appointing experts if necessary in deciding this matter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, it is very likely that the trial court would have appointed other experts to evaluate Maxwell and further testing would have been administered to determine whether he was mentally retarded. Such testing would have likely included the use of more definitive tests, like the Wechsler Adult Intelligence scale, which Dr. McPherson administered.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-9\">{\u00b6 179} Maxwell also argues the additional test results were invalid because they failed to take into account the \u201cFlynn effect.\u201d The Flynn effect postulates that IQ scores rise over time and that IQ tests that are not renormed to adjust for rising IQ levels will overstate a testee\u2019s IQ. <em>Walker v. True, </em>399 F.3d 315, 322 (4th Cir.2005). However, nothing about Maxwell\u2019s Flynn-effect adjusted IQ scores was presented during the trial or appears in the record. \u201cA reviewing court cannot add matter to the record before it, which was not part of the trial court\u2019s proceedings, and then decide the appeal on the basis of the new matter.\u201d <em>State v. Ishmail, </em>54 Ohio St.2d 402, 377 N.E.2d 500 (1978), paragraph one of the syllabus. Thus, these speculative claims are rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-10\">{\u00b6 180} Second, Maxwell argues that trial counsel were ineffective in failing to present evidence of his low intelligence during the penalty phase. Maxwell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>claims that counsel were deficient by failing to call Dr. Aronoff as a mitigation witness to testify about Maxwell\u2019s borderline intellectual functioning and his low IQ scores. \u201cThe defense decision to call or not call a mitigation witness is a matter of trial strategy. * * * Likewise, the scope of questioning is generally a matter left to the discretion of defense counsel. Debatable trial tactics generally do not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>State v. Elmore, </em>111 Ohio St.3d 515, 2006-Ohio-6207, 857 N.E.2d 547, \u00b6 116.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">{\u00b6 181} While it is unclear why trial counsel did not call Dr. Aronoff as a witness, trial counsel could have legitimately decided not to call Dr. Aronoff as a witness in order to avoid further discussion about Maxwell\u2019s possible malingering when taking the CAST*MR test. Moreover, Dr. McPherson discussed Dr. Aronoff s evaluations and findings that documented Maxwell\u2019s \u201cborderline intellectual functioning * * * at the time based on the WASI, a shorter form of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale.\u201d The decision to present Dr. McPherson\u2019s summary of Dr. Aronoff s findings instead of calling Dr. Aronoff as a witness was a matter of trial strategy and does not constitute ineffective assistance. <em>See State v. Keith, </em>79 Ohio St.3d 514, 530, 684 N.E.2d 47 (1997) (\u201cthe presentation of mitigating evidence is a matter of trial strategy\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">{\u00b6 182} In addition, the record shows that the decision not to call Dr. Aronoff as a witness did not result from a lack of investigation. Maxwell\u2019s lawyers knew that Dr. Aronoff existed and what his testimony would be. Because Maxwell\u2019s counsel knew what Dr. Aronoff had to say, counsel\u2019s decision not to call him as a witness during the penalty phase is \u201c \u2018virtually unchallengeable.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Mundt, </em>115 Ohio St.3d 22, 2007-Ohio-4836, 873 N.E.2d 828, \u00b6 158, quoting <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 690,104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">{\u00b6 183} Maxwell cites the ABA guidelines, which state, \u201cCounsel\u2019s duty to investigate and present mitigating evidence is now well established.\u201d <em>Guidelines for the Appointment and Performance of Defense Counsel in Death Penalty Cases, </em>Guideline 10.7, comment, 80 (Rev.Ed.2003). Maxwell argues that these guidelines required trial counsel to present Dr. Aronoffs testimony about Maxwell\u2019s low IQ scores. But the ABA guidelines are not \u201cinexorable commands\u201d with which all capital defense counsel must fully comply. <em>Van Hook, </em>558 U.S. at 8, 130 S.Ct. 13, 175 L.Ed.2d 255. Moreover, \u201c[ajttorneys are not expected to present every potential mitigation theory, regardless of their relative strengths.\u201d <em>Fears v. Bagley, </em>462 Fed.Appx. 565, 576 (6th Cir.2012). Thus, trial counsel were not duty-bound to present Dr. Aronoff s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-8\">{\u00b6 184} Third, Maxwell argues that trial counsel were ineffective by failing to request instructions that would have allowed the jury to make an <em>Atkins </em>finding. But trial counsel were not ineffective by failing to request such instructions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>because the jury does not decide whether a capital defendant is mentally retarded. <em>Were, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 448, 2008-Ohio-2762, 890 N.E.2d 263, at \u00b6 187.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">{\u00b6 185} Finally, Maxwell argues that trial counsel were ineffective by failing to make a penalty-phase closing argument that discussed his low intelligence as a mitigating factor. During the penalty-phase opening statements, trial counsel told jurors that the defense mitigation would consist of testimony from family members, friends, and coworkers about Maxwell\u2019s life, and testimony from Dr. McPherson about mitigating factors that she had found. During closing arguments, trial counsel did not make an argument about Maxwell\u2019s low intelligence. Rather, trial counsel argued residual doubt, a sole juror\u2019s ability to prevent the death penalty, Maxwell\u2019s alcohol abuse, testimony that Maxwell is a kind and good-hearted man, and the reality of a life sentence as a sentencing option.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-6\">{\u00b6 186} Trial counsel\u2019s argument appears to reflect a decision to downplay Maxwell\u2019s mental deficiencies as a mitigating factor while emphasizing other factors, such his family background and the realities of serving life in prison as punishment. Maxwell has failed to demonstrate that trial counsel\u2019s argument was professionally unreasonable. <em>See Bobby v. Bies, </em>556 U.S. 825, 836, 129 S.Ct. 2145, 173 L.Ed.2d 1173 (2009), quoting <em>Atkins, </em>536 U.S. at 321, 122 S.Ct. 2242, 153 L.Ed.2d 335 (\u201c \u2018[Rjeliance on mental retardation as a mitigating factor can be a two-edged sword that may enhance the likelihood that the aggravating factor of future dangerousness will be found by the jury\u2019 \u201d). Moreover, Maxwell fails to show prejudice, as it cannot be said that there was a reasonable likelihood of a different outcome had defense counsel argued Maxwell\u2019s low intelligence as a mitigating factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">b. Failure to prepare for mitigation</p>\n<p id=\"b159-8\">{\u00b6 187} Maxwell argues that trial counsel were also ineffective because they were unprepared for the penalty-phase hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-9\">{\u00b6 188} Maxwell argues that trial counsel showed that they were unprepared for mitigation by requesting a continuance on the first day of the penalty-phase proceedings. The jury returned its guilt-phase verdict on February 23, 2007, and the penalty-phase proceedings began on February 27, 2007. On the afternoon of February 27, trial counsel filed a motion requesting a continuance in the mitigation proceedings because they had not had adequate time to prepare a meaningful defense. Trial counsel\u2019s reasons for a continuance were Maxwell\u2019s mental illness, counsel\u2019s continued inability to properly communicate with Maxwell, and the prosecution\u2019s failure to provide the defense with records that the state wanted to be considered during mitigation. The prosecutor responded that there were no records that the state planned to present during its case-in-chief. The trial court denied the motion for a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>{\u00b6 189} The presentation of mitigating evidence is a matter of trial strategy. <em>State v. Lang, </em>129 Ohio St.3d 512, 2011-Ohio-4215, 954 N.E.2d 596, \u00b6 74. Counsel in a capital case has an \u201cobligation to conduct a thorough investigation of the defendant\u2019s background\u201d to determine the availability of mitigating evidence. <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 396, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">{\u00b6 190} Counsel\u2019s \u201cinvestigations into mitigating evidence \u2018should comprise efforts to discover <em>all reasonably available </em>mitigating evidence and evidence to rebut any aggravating evidence that may be introduced by the prosecutor.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>Wiggins v. Smith, </em>539 U.S. 510, 524,123 S.Ct. 2527, 156 L.Ed.2d 471 (2003), quoting <em>ABA Guidelines for the Appointment and Performance of Counsel in Death Penalty Cases, </em>section 11.4.1(C), 93 (1989).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-6\">This constitutionally required background investigation is necessary to enable counsel to make strategic choices about presenting a mitigation defense. * * * Indeed, the deference owed to counsel\u2019s strategic judgments about mitigation is directly proportional to the adequacy of the investigations supporting such judgments. Accordingly, when evaluating the reasonableness of counsel\u2019s mitigation strategy in a capital case, \u201ca reviewing court must consider the reasonableness of the investigation said to support that strategy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b160-7\"><em>Jells v. Mitchell, </em>538 F.3d 478, 492 (6th Cir.2008), quoting <em>Wiggins </em>at 527.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">{\u00b6 191} Trial counsel employed a criminal investigator, a clinical psychologist who was a mitigation specialist, and another psychologist who was a mitigation expert. The mitigation specialist interviewed Maxwell on several occasions beginning in May 2006. Dr. McPherson reviewed Maxwell\u2019s school records, prison records, and the records from his competency assessments. Thus, the defense had thoroughly prepared for the penalty phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">{\u00b6 192} Nevertheless, Maxwell argues that the record shows that trial counsel were unprepared for the penalty phase. First, Maxwell argues that counsel failed to develop evidence that his mental illness prevented him from communicating with counsel during the penalty phase. However, the trial court ruled that Maxwell was \u201ccapable of understanding the nature and objectives of this proceeding and of assisting his counsel\u201d after the competency hearing had been conducted. Thus, counsel reasonably could have decided that any further development of this claim was unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-10\">{\u00b6 193} Second, Maxwell argues that trial counsel were unprepared because they called only family members to testify that he was nonviolent, a good father, and a hard worker. Maxwell also questions trial counsel\u2019s effectiveness in calling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>these witnesses because their testimony opened the door to cross-examination about Maxwell\u2019s criminal record.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-6\">{\u00b6 194} Maxwell\u2019s initial claim is incorrect because Dr. McPherson provided expert testimony about Maxwell\u2019s background, his drug and alcohol problems, and his mental status. Testimony from family members and friends did reveal Maxwell\u2019s criminal past. But there were advantages as well as disadvantages in calling these witnesses. These witnesses helped to humanize him in front of the jury and showed that he had many positive characteristics as a good father and a hard worker.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-7\">{\u00b6 195} Moreover, trial counsel knew that Dr. McPherson was going to discuss Maxwell\u2019s criminal record during her testimony. Dr. McPherson testified that Maxwell\u2019s records from the Allen Correctional Institute showed that he was compliant with authority and had the skills to adjust to prison life. We hold that counsel\u2019s decision to call family members and friends was a reasonable trial strategy and did not violate <em>Strickland. See State v. Powell, </em>132 Ohio St.3d 233, 2012-Ohio-2577, 971 N.E.2d 865, \u00b6 218.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">{\u00b6 196} Third, Maxwell argues that trial counsel failed to develop evidence about his alcohol dependency. Dr. McPherson diagnosed Maxwell with alcohol abuse, probable dependency, currently in remission in a controlled setting. She testified that Maxwell has \u201ca history that included blackouts, that included high use and tolerance\u201d of alcohol that met \u201cthe criteria for an alcoholism or alcohol dependence diagnosis.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b161-9\">{\u00b6 197} Maxwell argues that trial counsel were deficient by failing to ask any of his family members about his drinking problems. Maxwell asserts that this omission undermined Dr. McPherson\u2019s diagnosis, since she acknowledged during cross-examination that her diagnosis of alcohol dependency was based on Maxwell\u2019s self-reporting. Maxwell also asserts that the lack of family testimony allowed the prosecutor to argue during closing argument that his drinking was not that serious, since \u201cthe people that see him every single day\u201d said nothing about his alcoholism. But Maxwell\u2019s claims about family testimony are speculative because it is unknown what they would have said about his drinking problems. Thus, we reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b161-10\">{\u00b6 198} Finally, Maxwell argues that the lack of a mitigation investigation was apparent because trial counsel indicated during the competency hearing that they had not seen his high school records. Trial counsel mentioned that they had not seen these records during the competency proceedings on February 6, 2007. Yet trial counsel had ample time to review these records prior to mitigation because the penalty-phase proceedings did not begin until February 27, 2007. We also reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>c. Failure to develop a coherent mitigation theme</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">{\u00b6 199} Maxwell argues that trial counsel were ineffective by failing to develop a coherent mitigation theme. Trial counsel\u2019s strategy was to convince the jury that Maxwell should receive a life sentence by emphasizing Maxwell\u2019s positive traits and demonstrating that he had low intelligence, suffered from alcohol dependency, had no significant history of violence, and would be a good prisoner. Trial counsel also raised residual doubt as a reason for a life sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">{\u00b6 200} In support of this strategy, trial counsel presented the testimony of Maxwell\u2019s family members and coworkers that Maxwell was kind-hearted, a good worker, and a family man. Dr. McPherson reviewed Maxwell\u2019s educational records and discussed test results that showed his low intelligence. She also reviewed his prison records and explained how they showed that Maxwell would be a good prisoner if given a life sentence. Dr. McPherson also explained that Maxwell had suffered from alcohol dependency. The defense theory, although unsuccessful, was coherent and fit into the testimony. Counsel made a strategic decision in presenting the defense mitigation theory and were not ineffective. <em>See State v. Davis, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 404, 2008-Ohio-2, 880 N.E.2d 31, \u00b6 351-352.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-7\">d. Arguing residual doubt</p>\n<p id=\"b162-8\">{\u00b6 201} Maxwell argues that trial counsel were deficient by improperly raising and arguing residual doubt as the only mitigating factor during the penalty-phase closing arguments. He cites <em>State v. McGuire, </em>80 Ohio St.3d 390, 686 N.E.2d 1112 (1997). In <em>McGuire, </em>this court held that \u201c[rjesidual doubt is not an acceptable mitigating factor under R.C. 2929.04(B), since it is irrelevant to the issue of whether the defendant should be sentenced to death.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>at syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-9\">{\u00b6 202} Trial counsel raised residual doubt as a reason not to impose the death penalty during closing arguments but also set forth other reasons for a life sentence. Trial counsel emphasized family testimony demonstrating Maxwell\u2019s positive traits, his lack of any significant history of violence, and his apology to Nichole\u2019s family. They also argued that the jury should consider that Maxwell suffered from alcoholism, headaches, and neurological problems. Thus, trial counsel did not rely exclusively on residual doubt in arguing that Maxwell should not be sentenced to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-10\">{\u00b6 203} Maxwell also does not explain how raising residual doubt during closing arguments was prejudicial. Thus, he has failed to demonstrate that trial counsel was ineffective by arguing residual doubt. We reject this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>e. Misidentification of Dr. McPherson\u2019s qualifications</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">{\u00b6 204} Maxwell argues that trial counsel improperly elicited from Dr. McPherson that she was a certified mitigation specialist. Maxwell asserts that certification as a mitigation specialist is a designation that does not exist.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">{\u00b6205} Dr. McPherson testified that she had been certified as a mitigation specialist. Trial counsel then tendered her as an expert witness in the area of mitigation. Without objection, the trial court allowed Dr. McPherson to testify as an expert.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-7\">{\u00b6 206} Maxwell misstates the court\u2019s ruling and erroneously claims that the trial court sustained the state\u2019s objection to Dr. McPherson\u2019s designation as a certified mitigation specialist and that this ruling undermined the credibility of the witness. In any event, there is little chance that any improper testimony about Dr. McPherson\u2019s certification as a mitigation specialist was prejudicial. Thus, we reject this ineffectiveness claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-8\">f. Failure to object to cross-examination of Dr. McPherson</p>\n<p id=\"b163-9\">{\u00b6 207} Maxwell argues that trial counsel failed to object to cross-examination of Dr. McPherson that \u201climited the jury\u2019s consideration of the evidence it could treat as mitigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b163-10\">{\u00b6 208} In <em>State v. DePew, </em>38 Ohio St.3d 275, 288, 528 N.E.2d 542 (1988), the court stated that \u201cit is the defendant who has the right to present and argue the mitigating factors. If he does not do so, no comment on any factors not raised by him is permissible.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b163-11\">{\u00b6 209} Dr. McPherson provided testimony about Maxwell\u2019s mental status, possible neurological problems, ability to adapt to prison life, and his history of alcohol abuse that the jury could consider as mitigating evidence. The prosecutor\u2019s cross-examination of Dr. McPherson addressed these issues. The prosecutor\u2019s questioning did not elicit objectionable information that limited the jury\u2019s consideration of the mitigating evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-12\">{\u00b6 210} Moreover, the trial court instructed the jury, \u201cYou must consider all the mitigating factors presented to you. Mitigating factors include any factors that weigh in favor of a sentence other than death. This means that you are not limited to specific mitigating factors, you should consider any mitigating factors that weigh in favor of a sentence other than death.\u201d These instructions ensured that the jury understood its role in considering mitigation. Thus, trial counsel were not deficient by failing to object to such questioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-13\">{\u00b6 211} Maxwell also argues that trial counsel were deficient by failing to object to the prosecutor\u2019s reference to the R.C. 2929.04(B)(7) mitigating factor as the \u201ccatchall\u201d factor. R.C. 2929.04(B)(7) permits a capital defendant to present \u201c[a]ny other factors that are relevant to the issue of whether the offender should <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>be sentenced to death.\u201d Maxwell claims that trial counsel should have objected to the word \u201ccatchall\u201d because that designation implied that mitigation presented under (B)(7) did not merit the same consideration as evidence relating to the other statutory mitigating factors. But nothing shows that the jury gave less weight to (B)(7) evidence. Thus, we also reject this speculative claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">g. Failure to object and preserve error</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">{\u00b6 212} Finally, Maxwell complains that trial counsel failed to object to the trial court\u2019s use of the term \u201crecommendation\u201d during voir dire, failed to properly request a neurologist to assist in mitigation, and failed to object to the prosecutor\u2019s penalty-phase argument. Maxwell raised counsel\u2019s failure to object to the trial court\u2019s use of the term \u201crecommendation\u201d in proposition IV. But this claim lacks merit because counsel did object. Maxwell\u2019s other two claims recast unsuccessful substantive propositions of law into ineffectiveness claims. But as discussed below in proposition XI, Maxwell was not prejudiced by counsel\u2019s failure to object to the prosecutor\u2019s penalty-phase argument. And as discussed next in proposition XII, trial counsel were not ineffective by failing to request a neurologist for mitigation purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">{\u00b6 213} Based on the foregoing, we overrule proposition I.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-8\">2. <em>Failure to appoint a neurologist </em>(Proposition of law XII)</p>\n<p id=\"b164-9\">{\u00b6214} Maxwell argues that the trial court erred by failing to appoint a neurologist to develop mitigation. He also repeats claims that trial counsel were ineffective by failing to request a neurologist for mitigating purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-10\">a. Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b164-11\">{\u00b6 215} On January 19, 2007, trial counsel filed a motion requesting funds to allow Dr. John Fabian to perform a neurological evaluation of Maxwell\u2019s mental condition. Trial counsel stated that in assessing Maxwell\u2019s medical history during the competency evaluation, \u201cthe Court Psychiatric Clinic and Noi'theoast indicated that Defendant was rendered unconscious for some time [due] to a motorcycle accident.\u201d Thus, trial counsel requested the court \u201cto allow Dr. Fabian to continue to evaluate Defendant for Competency and Sanity and to allow him to conduct neurological testing and prepare reports outlining his findings and opinions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b164-12\">{\u00b6 216} During the competency hearing on February 6, 2007, trial counsel clarified that they were not requesting Dr. Fabian to conduct the neurological evaluation of Maxwell, since Dr. Fabian was not a neurologist. Dr. Fabian was serving as a liaison with neurologists who perform this type of testing. Trial counsel then stated that they were requesting a neurological evaluation because Maxwell had told them that his life and the way he looks at things were different <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>since that motorcycle accident. Thus, counsel requested a neurological evaluation to provide \u201cobjective medical findings in terms of an MRI or a CAT scan as per Dr. Fabian\u2019s recommendation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-5\">{\u00b6 217} During the competency hearing, Dr. Cook testified that she had talked, to Maxwell about the motorcycle accident, and he told her that he had received no treatment and had not been hospitalized as a result of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-6\">{\u00b6 218} Dr. Aronoff testified that he had reviewed Maxwell\u2019s medical records that showed he was treated at Meridia-Huron Hospital on March 29, 1999, after the motorcycle accident. Dr. Aronoff quoted findings from the medical records that reported that Maxwell was \u201csitting on motorcycle which was struck from behind by a car at low speed. He was thrown off the bike on to the right side. No loss of consciousness. Was wearing a helmet. Right shoulder, right hip, right elbow, right ankle are painful. No headache or neck pain.\u201d Dr. Aronoff also stated that x-rays were taken of Maxwell\u2019s shoulder, elbow, ankle, and hip, and they were all unremarkable.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> However, Dr. Aronoff testified that Maxwell told him that he was rendered unconscious in the motorcycle accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-7\">{\u00b6 219} The trial court denied the defense request for a neurological evaluation. Trial counsel did not renew the request for a neurologist during the remainder of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-8\">b. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b165-9\">{\u00b6 220} As a matter of due process, an indigent defendant in a capital case is entitled to the basic tools with which to conduct an adequate defense. <em>Ake v. Oklahoma, </em>470 U.S. 68, 77, 105 S.Ct. 1087, 84 L.Ed.2d 53 (1985). In <em>Ake, </em>the United States Supreme Court concluded that the state must provide a psychiatric expert for the defense when the defendant has made a preliminary showing that his sanity will be a significant factor at trial. <em>Id. </em>at 74. Although <em>Ake </em>dealt only with a defendant\u2019s entitlement to psychiatric assistance, this court has recognized that due process may require the state to provide other types of expert assistance to a criminal defendant. <em>State v. Mason, </em>82 Ohio St.3d 144, 149, 694 N.E.2d 932 (1998). Moreover, R.C. 2929.024 requires the trial court to provide expert assistance when \u201creasonably necessary for the proper representation of a defendant charged with aggravated murder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b165-10\">{\u00b6 221} In <em>Mason, </em>the court held that the state must provide an indigent criminal defendant with funds to obtain expert assistance when the defendant has made a particularized showing that (1) there exists a reasonable probability that the requested expert would aid the defense and (2) denial of that expert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>assistance would result in an unfair trial. The trial court\u2019s ruling on such requests is a matter left to the exercise of the court\u2019s \u201csound discretion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">{\u00b6 222} Trial counsel did not request the appointment of a neurologist for purposes of mitigation. Rather, as the defense concedes, trial counsel requested a neurologist in the context of his competency evaluation. Thus, this claim lacks merit because the trial court never entertained a defense motion for a neurologist for mitigation purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">{\u00b6 223} Even assuming that the trial court should have construed the defense motion for a neurologist as carrying over for mitigation purposes, we hold that no error occurred. A defendant must show not just a mere possibility but a reasonable probability that an expert would aid in his defense. State <em>v. Broom, </em>40 Ohio St.3d 277, 283, 533 N.E.2d 682 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b166-7\">{\u00b6 224} The defense request for a neurologist was based upon Dr. Fabian\u2019s recommendation and reports obtained during his competency evaluation stating that Maxwell was rendered unconscious following an earlier motorcycle accident. But Dr. Fabian did not testify, and any written reports from him were not submitted to the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-8\">'{\u00b6 225} Maxwell\u2019s medical records showed that he suffered no loss of consciousness and reported no headache or neck pain as a result of that motorcycle accident. Thus, Maxwell\u2019s request merely raised the possibility that he had suffered a brain injury as a result of a motorcycle accident. It was not supported by anything in his medical records. Moreover, the medical records contradicted Maxwell\u2019s story about what happened after the accident. Maxwell told Dr. Aronoff that he was rendered unconscious, and he told Dr. Cook that he received no medical treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-9\">{\u00b6226} Maxwell cites <em>State v. Eppinger, </em>91 Ohio St.3d 158, 743 N.E.2d 881 (2001), in arguing that the defense was entitled to a neurologist. <em>Eppinger </em>addressed a defendant\u2019s right to an expert psychologist at a sexual-offender-classification hearing. <em>Eppinger </em>held that a defendant is entitled to such an expert if the trial court determines that the expert\u2019s services are reasonably necessary to aid in determining whether the offender is likely to engage in the future in one or more sexually oriented offenses. <em>Id. </em>at syllabus. <em>Eppinger </em>involved a totally different type of fact situation from the present case and does not support Maxwell\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-10\">{\u00b6 227} Maxwell also cites <em>Frazier v. Huffman, </em>343 F.3d 780 (6th Cir.2003), in arguing that the trial court erred in not appointing a neurologist. In <em>Huffman, </em>a capital case, the court held that defense counsel were ineffective by failing to investigate and present evidence of the defendant\u2019s brain impairment during the trial. <em>Id. </em>at 797. The court found that counsel were ineffective because after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>reviewing the defendant\u2019s medical records, they were aware that the defendant had suffered a brain injury from falling from a ladder, but they failed to investigate and present evidence about it. <em>Id. </em>at 794-795. Unlike the records in <em>Huffman, </em>Maxwell\u2019s medical records contain nothing that documents that he had suffered any brain injuries. Thus, <em>Huffman </em>is inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">{\u00b6 228} Based on the foregoing, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the defense request for a neurologist. <em>Compare Hugh-banks, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 365, 2003-Ohio-4121, 792 N.E.2d 1081, at \u00b6 44-46 (no particularized need demonstrated for neuropharmacologist); <em>State v. Campbell, </em>90 Ohio St.3d 320, 327-328, 738 N.E.2d 1178 (2000) (\u201cmere possibility that the [specialized chest X-ray] could have had some [mitigation] value to the defense was not enough\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">c. Ineffective assistance of counsel</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">{\u00b6 229} In proposition of law I, Maxwell asserted that trial counsel were ineffective by failing to request a neurologist to assist in the development of mitigation. Yet Maxwell provides no argument and cites no legal authority in support of this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-8\">{\u00b6 230} Our review of this ineffectiveness claim starts with a review of Dr. McPherson\u2019s testimony to determine whether she provided counsel with additional information about Maxwell\u2019s head injuries from the motorcycle accident that required counsel to conduct a further investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-9\">{\u00b6 231} Dr. McPherson administered the Bender-Gestalt test during her evaluation of Maxwell. She described the Bender-Gestalt as a \u201ccopying task\u201d that serves as a low-level screening test. She testified that there was \u201csome indication [that] his hand might not have been steady, but there were distortions that didn\u2019t make a lot of sense, so the question remained as to whether or not there was some kind of organically based anomaly, something that affects how his brain processes information.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b167-10\">{\u00b6 232} Dr. McPherson testified about past injuries that Maxwell reported suffering. Maxwell stated that he had been briefly unconscious after falling off a horse but that he did not receive any medical treatment for that incident. Dr. McPherson also discussed the motorcycle accident and said, \u201c[H]e may have been briefly unconscious. He was certainly conscious when he was seen at the hospital for that one.\u201d Dr. McPherson also stated that there was nothing in Maxwell\u2019s medical records showing that he had suffered a traumatic head injury in the motorcycle accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-11\">{\u00b6 233} In discussing her final diagnosis, Dr. McPherson stated that Maxwell suffered from an adjustment disorder with depression and probable alcohol dependency. Dr. McPherson testified that she could not determine whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>Maxwell had had a traumatic brain injury and advised that \u201cwhoever is worldng with him next should continue to be aware that this may be there and try to come up with information to either rule it in or out.\u201d She also testified that Maxwell has \u201csome type of cognitive difficulty. He may have some underlying organic problems and these may have rendered him more likely to react with irritability since that\u2019s one of the known things that can occur with certain kinds of organicity making him more prone to act out in a stressful situation such as a relationship that was flawed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">{\u00b6 234} Dr. McPherson\u2019s testimony about the need for further testing to rule out possible brain impairment appears to be based upon Maxwell\u2019s performance on the Bender-Gestalt test. She testified that the Bender-Gestalt test indicated some distortions, but she did not indicate that these results were conclusive as to brain damage. Thus, the Bender-Gestalt results raised only the possibility of brain impairment. <em>See State v. Allen, </em>73 Ohio St.3d 626, 642, 653 N.E.2d 675 (1995) (trial court did not abuse discretion in refusing to appoint neurologist based on Bender-Gestalt test that showed little likelihood of brain damage).</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">{\u00b6 235} Maxwell fails to establish that counsel were deficient by failing to request a neurologist for mitigation purposes based on Dr. McPherson\u2019s testimony. First, the record does not show that trial counsel failed to investigate the need to request a neurologist after reviewing Dr. McPherson\u2019s findings. We cannot infer a defense failure to investigate from a silent record; the burden of demonstrating ineffective assistance is on Maxwell. <em>See Were, </em>118 Ohio St.3d 448, 2008-Ohio-2762, 890 N.E.2d 263, at \u00b6 244.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">{\u00b6 236} Second, the trial court could have properly denied a motion for a neurologist because Maxwell would have been unable to make a particularized showing of a reasonable probability that the requested expert would aid in his defense. <em>Mason, </em>82 Ohio St.3d 144, 694 N.E.2d 932, syllabus. Dr. McPherson reiterated that Maxwell\u2019s medical records did not show that he had suffered a traumatic head injury during the motorcycle accident. Indeed, Dr. McPherson\u2019s information about a possible head injury resulted from Maxwell\u2019s self-reporting.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">{\u00b6 237} Finally, Maxwell has failed to show that the absence of a neurological evaluation resulted in an unfair trial. <em>Id. </em>Dr. McPherson testified that there might be \u201csome underlying organic problems and these <em>may have </em>rendered him more likely to react with irritability * * * in a stressful situation.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The evidence showed that Maxwell murdered Nichole in retaliation for her testimony. Accordingly, this was a planned murder rather than a sudden encounter involving a stressful situation. Thus, we reject this ineffectiveness claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-9\">{\u00b6 238} Based on the foregoing, proposition XII is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>3. <em>Reintroduction of guilt-phase evidence </em>(Proposition of law XVI)</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">{\u00b6 239} Maxwell argues that the trial court erred by admitting guilt-phase evidence during the penalty phase that was irrelevant. The trial court, over defense objection, admitted photographs showing the victim displaying injuries she suffered during the felonious assault, a photograph of the victim without injuries, and an autopsy photograph of the victim\u2019s face.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-8\">{\u00b6 240} R.C. 2929.03(D)(1) provides that at the penalty stage of a capital proceeding, the court and jury shall consider \u201cany evidence raised at trial that is relevant to the aggravating circumstances the offender was found guilty of committing * * * [and] hear testimony and other evidence that is relevant to the nature and circumstances of the aggravating circumstances the offender was found guilty of committing.\u201d <em>DePew, </em>38 Ohio St.3d at 282-283, 528 N.E.2d 542. The trial court did not abuse its discretion in readmitting photographs displaying injuries that Nichole suffered during the felonious assault or the autopsy photograph, because these items bore some relevance to the nature and circumstances surrounding the R.C. 2929.04(A)(8) specification. The photograph of Nichole without injuries was of questionable relevance, but no prejudice resulted from its introduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-9\">{\u00b6 241} Based on the foregoing, proposition XVI is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-10\">4. <em>Prosecutorial misconduct during closing arguments </em>(Proposition of law XI)</p>\n<p id=\"b169-11\">{\u00b6 242} Maxwell argues that the prosecutor committed various instances of prosecutorial misconduct during his closing arguments. However, except where noted, trial counsel failed to object to the prosecutor\u2019s argument and thus waived all but plain error. <em>State v. Williams, </em>51 Ohio St.2d 112, 364 N.E.2d 1364 (1977), paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-12\">{\u00b6 243} Whether a prosecutor\u2019s remarks constitute misconduct depends upon (1) whether the remarks were improper and, if so, (2) whether the remarks prejudicially affected an accused\u2019s substantial rights. <em>State v. Smith, </em>14 Ohio St.3d 13, 14, 470 N.E.2d 883 (1984). The touchstone of the analysis \u201cis the fairness of the trial, not the culpability of the prosecutor.\u201d <em>Smith v. Phillips, </em>455 U.S. 209, 219, 102 S.Ct. 940, 71 L.Ed.2d 78 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b169-13\">{\u00b6 244} First, Maxwell argues that, over defense objection, the prosecutor commented, \u201cI know it\u2019s devastating for the families, especially Nichole\u2019s family and what they\u2019ve gone through.\u201d The mention of \u201cthe personal situation of the victim\u2019s family, without more, does not constitute misconduct.\u201d <em>State v. Goodwin, </em>84 Ohio St.3d 331, 339, 703 N.E.2d 1251 (1999). The prosecutor\u2019s comments about the victim\u2019s family were brief and did not dwell on the pain they suffered. Thus, we hold that no misconduct occurred. <em>See State v. Brinkley, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 231, 2005-Ohio-1507, 824 N.E.2d 959, \u00b6 140.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>{\u00b6 245} Second, Maxwell argues that the prosecutor improperly argued that his ability to adapt to prison life was not a mitigating factor. During arguments, the prosecutor stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-5\">You must engage in that weighing process and * * * with that aggravating circumstance, the retaliation think what have you heard in this case that mitigates against that * * *. What mitigating factors have you heard? He\u2019s capable of conforming to prison life? That\u2019s a mitigating factor? Is that \u2014 really? You assign the weight that you think each of these deserve.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">{\u00b6 246} \u201cProsecutors can urge the merits of their cause and legitimately argue that defense mitigation evidence is worthy of little or no weight.\u201d <em>State v. Wilson, </em>74 Ohio St.3d 381, 399, 659 N.E.2d 292 (1996). The prosecutor was not arguing that Maxwell\u2019s ability to adapt to prison was not a mitigating factor. Rather, the prosecutor was responding to Dr. McPherson\u2019s testimony that Maxwell could conform his conduct to the highly structured setting of a prison. He was arguing that such evidence was not entitled to significant weight. Nothing in this argument resulted in plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">{\u00b6 247} Finally, Maxwell contends that the prosecutor misbehaved by arguing the absence of mitigating factors the defense never raised. The prosecutor argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b170-8\">You\u2019ve had good people come up here and tell you about Mr. Maxwell, try to mitigate against this aggravating circumstance. We didn\u2019t hear bad childhood, abusive situations, * * * wanting for anything in life. We just didn\u2019t hear it. We heard he had support. We heard he was raised correctly. He went to church. You know and the Judge \u2014 the doctor said no mental defect or disease. Did you hear any remorse? I mean I don\u2019t \u2014 those are the things that you have to consider, folks.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">{\u00b6 248} \u201cA prosecutor can respond to issues raised by an accused.\u201d <em>State v. Cassano, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 94, 2002-Ohio-3751, 772 N.E.2d 81, \u00b6 101. The prosecutor was responding to extensive testimony presented by Maxwell\u2019s friends and family members, stating that Maxwell was kind-hearted, a good man, and a family man. Ernestine Brewer, Maxwell\u2019s mother, testified that he was \u201ca great kid\u201d and was raised in the church. The prosecutor\u2019s comments about remorse responded to Maxwell\u2019s unsworn statement: \u201cI would like to say that I\u2019m sorry to the victim\u2019s family and my family for going through this. I wouldn\u2019t want nobody\u2019s family to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>go through this.\u201d The prosecutor\u2019s comments about defense testimony and Maxwell\u2019s unsworn statement represented fair comment and did not constitute plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">{\u00b6 249} Based on the foregoing, proposition XI is rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">\n<em>C. Remaining issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">1. <em>Appropriateness of death sentence </em>(Proposition of law XVIII)</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">{\u00b6 250} Maxwell argues that the death penalty is not appropriate because of the compelling mitigating evidence presented in his behalf. We will address these arguments during our independent sentence evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">2. <em>Cumulative error </em>(Proposition of law XVII)</p>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">{\u00b6 251} Maxwell claims that the cumulative effect of errors committed during trial deprived him of a fair trial and necessitates reversal of his conviction and death sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-10\">{\u00b6 252} We have recognized the doctrine of cumulative error. <em>State v. DeMarco, </em>31 Ohio St.3d 191, 509 N.E.2d 1256 (1987), paragraph two of the syllabus. Under this doctrine, a conviction will be reversed when the cumulative effect of errors in a trial deprives a defendant of a fair trial even though each of the numerous instances of trial-court error does not individually constitute cause for reversal. <em>Id. </em>at 196-197.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-11\">{\u00b6 253} The doctrine of cumulative error is not applicable in the present case. Maxwell received a fair trial, and there are not numerous instances of trial-court error. Moreover, Maxwell was not prejudiced by any error at the trial or penalty phase of the proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-12\">3. <em>Settled issues </em>(Proposition of law XIX)</p>\n<p id=\"b171-13\">{\u00b6 254} Maxwell challenges the constitutionality of Ohio\u2019s death-penalty statutes under both the United States Constitution and the Ohio Constitution. We reject these claims on the basis of <em>State v. Carter, </em>89 Ohio St.3d 593, 607, 734 N.E.2d 345 (2000); <em>State v. Steffen, </em>31 Ohio St.3d 111, 509 N.E.2d 383 (1987), paragraph one of the syllabus; <em>State v. Jenkins, </em>15 Ohio St.3d 164, 473 N.E.2d 264 (1984), paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-14\">{\u00b6 255} Maxwell also challenges the constitutionality of Ohio\u2019s reasonable-doubt standard. However, this court has affirmed the constitutionality of R.C. 2901.05(D). <em>Jones, </em>91 Ohio St.3d at 347, 744 N.E.2d 1163; <em>see also State v. Goff, </em>82 Ohio St.3d 123,132, 694 N.E.2d 916 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>IV. Independent Sentence Evaluation</p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">{\u00b6256} Having considered Maxwell\u2019s propositions of law, this court must independently review Maxwell\u2019s death sentence for appropriateness and proportionality and independently determine whether the aggravating circumstance of which Maxwell was convicted outweighs the mitigating factors pursuant to R.C. 2929.05(A). The R.C. 2929.04(A)(3) murder-to-escape-accountability specification was merged with the R.C. 2929.04(A)(8) retaliation specification before sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">\n<em>A. Aggravating circumstance</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">{\u00b6 257} The evidence at trial established beyond a reasonable doubt that Maxwell murdered Nichole McCorkle in retaliation for her testimony in a criminal proceeding, R.C. 2929.04(A)(8). Accordingly, we consider whether the aggravating circumstance of which Maxwell was convicted, R.C. 2929.04(A)(8), murder in retaliation for testimony in another criminal proceeding, outweighs the evidence presented in mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">\n<em>B. Mitigating evidence presented</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">{\u00b6 258} Maxwell called ten mitigating witnesses and made an unsworn statement. William Steward, Maxwell\u2019s oldest brother, testified that Maxwell comes from a good family. Maxwell has four brothers and three sisters. Steward stated that Maxwell has a good heart and will give the shirt off his back to help people. Maxwell graduated from high school and later obtained vocational training and learned how to operate heavy machinery. Steward also stated: \u201c[Maxwell] is not a monster or anything. * * * [T]he picture that\u2019s being painted here is I think a little bit different than what really lurks here.\u201d Finally, Steward stated, \u201cI personally would like to say to the victims that I apologize and I\u2019m sorry about * * * what the family is going through and this whole incident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">{\u00b6 259} Herbert Nelson, grew up with Maxwell, a first cousin, and Maxwell\u2019s family would visit Nelson, who lived in Arkansas. Nelson later moved to the Cleveland area, and he and Maxwell worked jobs together. Nelson testified that Maxwell was a \u201creal good worker\u201d and a \u201creal good guy.\u201d Nelson stated that he missed Maxwell and asked the court to have mercy on him.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-10\">{\u00b6 260} Veronica Nelson, Herbert\u2019s wife, had known Maxwell since she became engaged to marry her husband five years earlier. Veronica testified that she has always felt comfortable around Maxwell. She stated that he was \u201calways well-dressed, well-behaved, not drunken, not cursing, [and] mannerable.\u201d Maxwell was also \u201cloving towards his family, his mother, his sisters, at all times.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b173-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>{\u00b6 261} Roscoe Horne, a neighbor, testified that he had known Maxwell since 2002 or 2003 and that Maxwell had performed construction work for Horne\u2019s construction company. Horne stated that Maxwell operated heavy equipment and was an excellent worker and very trustworthy. Horne also described him as a good neighbor who was friendly and went out of his way to help other people. Horne testified that Maxwell often took food to older people during the holidays. Horne concluded by saying, \u201c[A] lot of people love him and our hearts go out to him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\">{\u00b6 262} Bernard McNear, Maxwell\u2019s brother-in-law, had known Maxwell for five or six years. McNear testified that Maxwell offered him the opportunity to work on construction jobs and helped teach him the work. McNear stated that Maxwell was an outgoing person and was always willing to talk with McNear and give him positive advice.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">{\u00b6 263} Theresa McNear, Maxwell\u2019s younger sister, testified that Maxwell was a nice guy. Theresa spent a lot of time tagging along with Maxwell when they were growing up. They went fishing together, and Maxwell tried to teach her how to ride a horse. Maxwell provided Theresa with help in dealing with stressful issues and helped Theresa\u2019s daughter with her homework. Theresa also testified that Maxwell loved his daughter, C.M., and had a good interaction with her. Theresa concluded that Maxwell had a huge heart, loved hard, and would help anybody.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">{\u00b6 264} Sharon Graves, Maxwell\u2019s older sister, testified that he was a playful child and was always there if his brothers and sisters needed him. Graves stated that Maxwell had a loving relationship with C.M. Graves also stated that Maxwell had been supportive of her children and went to her daughter\u2019s high school graduation. Graves emphasized that Maxwell was a \u201cgood person.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">{\u00b6 265} Andy Maxwell, the defendant\u2019s younger brother, had always wanted to follow his big brother. When Andy was eight years old, Maxwell saved Andy from drowning. Andy testified that Maxwell had \u201cbeen like that\u201d all through life. He stated that Maxwell had a great relationship with C.M. and took her horseback riding and did other activities with her. Maxwell had also been very helpful with other people. For example, Maxwell distributed a list of information about felons needing jobs to possible employers.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">{\u00b6 266} Ernestine Brewer, Maxwell\u2019s mother, testified that Maxwell was born in Arkansas but spent most of his life in Ohio. Brewer testified that Maxwell was raised in the church and was a \u201cBible-taught kid.\u201d Brewer said that Maxwell spent time in prison but was always by her side after his release. Brewer said that Maxwell was a \u201cgood kid.\u201d In conclusion, she told the jury, \u201cHe might have fell by the wayside and I\u2019m asking them to please spare his life * * *. People do things out of anger, you know, so that\u2019s it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b174-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>{\u00b6 267} Dr. Sandra McPherson evaluated and conducted psychological testing of Maxwell. Dr. McPherson evaluated Maxwell\u2019s educational records from the Cleveland public schools, his records from Allen Correctional Institute, where he spent five years, and his competency assessments.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">{\u00b6 268} Dr. McPherson testified that Maxwell did not do particularly well in school. His grades \u201ctended to be * * * D\u2019s and F\u2019s; there were some C\u2019s.\u201d Dr. McPherson stated that Maxwell\u2019s criminal records show charges and convictions for drug trafficking and that there was also \u201ca domestic violence associated with the victim of this crime.\u201d Maxwell\u2019s prison records show that he was \u201ccompliant with authority.\u201d Dr. McPherson stated that \u201cthere was a report rendered to the parole board saying that his conduct had been basically exemplary and that he would be appropriate for release.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">{\u00b6 269} Maxwell also received a series of assessments during his competency evaluation that found him to be competent. Dr. McPherson testified that there were symptoms of possible mental illness, but there were also questions as to whether he was exaggerating them. Dr. McPherson also testified that there was a confirmed diagnosis of alcohol dependence, and other diagnoses included \u201ca differential between paranoid personality disorder and paranoid psychosis which was unresolved as well as borderline intellectual functioning.\u201d A history of head trauma was also noted in these evaluations.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">{\u00b6 270} Dr. McPherson testified that Maxwell\u2019s reading ability is at the eighth-grade level. Results from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale showed that Maxwell has a full-scale IQ of 84, a performance IQ of 95, and a verbal IQ of 77. She testified that results from the Bender-Gestalt test showed some distortions that might reflect \u201csome kind of organically based anomaly, something that affects how his brain processes information.\u201d She stated that Maxwell reported two head injuries. One injury occurred when he fell off a horse, and the other resulted from a motorcycle accident. Maxwell reported that he had periodic headaches that have continued through the years, and these interfere with his functioning when they occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">{\u00b6 271} Results of the Thematic Apperception Test were relatively limited. Dr. McPherson testified that there were indications in Maxwell\u2019s stories of depression and a desire to avoid what was unpleasant. Results on the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory-2 showed that his validity scales were within range, and the clinical scales were within normal limits. Dr. McPherson testified that there was \u201cno sign of any psychosis or condition that would have rendered him incapable of understanding what\u2019s going on in the world around him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">{\u00b6 272} Dr. McPherson diagnosed Maxwell with an adjustment disorder with depression and alcohol abuse, probable dependency, currently in remission in a controlled setting. Dr. McPherson\u2019s diagnosis included \u201cRule out traumatic brain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>injury with residual systems.\u201d Dr. McPherson testified that this means \u201cI can\u2019t call it but whoever is working with him next should continue to be aware that this may be there and try to come up with information to either rule it in or out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">{\u00b6 273} Dr. McPherson discussed mitigating factors that she found from her tests and interviews. She stated that Maxwell is capable of conforming his conduct in a highly structured setting and has the skills to adjust to prison and not be a problem. Dr. McPherson stated that Maxwell has some cognitive difficulty. He may have some underlying organic problems, and these may have rendered him more likely to react with irritability in a stressful situation such as a flawed relationship. She also testified that Maxwell has no record of violence other than the current situation. In addition, Maxwell has indicated his desire to be a positive person, and he has done things for his family.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">{\u00b6 274} Finally, Dr. McPherson stated that Maxwell maintains his innocence of the crime and continues to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">{\u00b6 275} Maxwell made an unsworn statement during mitigation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-9\">First of all, I would like to say that I\u2019m sorry to the victim\u2019s family and my family for going through this. I wouldn\u2019t want nobody\u2019s family to go through this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-10\">And I have one child and I did this to see her this one last time. And my family haven\u2019t saw her, I haven\u2019t saw her and my father is always in Arkansas and he comes to see her every two years probably and that\u2019s the only grandchild he has and I want her to be a part of his life.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-11\">{\u00b6 276} The next segment of Maxwell\u2019s unsworn statement was addressed to his daughter, C.M.:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-12\">I love her and I miss her. And I miss her mother too. And I want her to be a part of my family\u2019s life. The little time that I have with her.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b175-13\">{\u00b6 277} The final segment of Maxwell\u2019s unsworn statement was addressed to Nichole\u2019s family:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b175-14\">I want to say that I\u2019m sorry that they had to go through this. And I would ask them if they would let [C.M.] be a part of my family, my family\u2019s life. She love them and they love her.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>{\u00b6 278} Before final sentencing, Maxwell made a statement in allocution for the trial court\u2019s consideration:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b176-4\">I want to say I\u2019m sorry for the tragedy and what I meant to say was I want to be able to see my daughter grow up and my family \u2014 she be a part of my family because they\u2019re going to keep her away from my family and I want to be able to live and see her grow up. * * * I would like to be able to live and see her grow into a person. Thank you.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">{\u00b6 279} The statutory mitigating factors under R.C. 2929.04(B) include (B)(1) (inducement of murder by victim), (B)(2) (duress, coercion, or strong provocation), (B)(3) (mental disease or defect), (B)(4) (youth of the offender), (B)(5) (lack of a significant criminal record), (B)(6) (not being the principal offender), and (B)(7) (any other relevant factors). The first six factors do not apply, but several points in mitigation arise under the (B)(7) factor. We give appropriate weight to Maxwell\u2019s low-average intelligence (IQ of 84). His diagnosed alcohol abuse is also entitled to some weight. <em>See Craig, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 306, 2006-Ohio-4571, 853 N.E.2d 621, at \u00b6 146.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">{\u00b6 280} Some weight should be given to the love and support that Maxwell shares with his family. <em>See State v. Myers, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 335, 2002-Ohio-6658, 780 N.E.2d 186, \u00b6 178. We also give some weight to testimony that Maxwell is a good and dependable worker. <em>See State v. Trimble, </em>122 Ohio St.3d 297, 2009-Ohio-2961, 911 N.E.2d 242, \u00b6 327.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">{\u00b6 281} Maxwell argues that this court should consider testimony that he will be able to adjust well to prison life. <em>See State v. Madrigal, </em>87 Ohio St.3d 378, 397, 721 N.E.2d 52 (2000). Dr. McPherson testified that Maxwell\u2019s prison records showed that his conduct had been exemplary in prison. We give some weight in mitigation to Maxwell\u2019s ability to adjust to prison life.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">{\u00b6282} Maxwell also argues that his remorse is entitled to weight as a mitigating factor. In his unsworn statement, Maxwell apologized to his family and the victim\u2019s family \u201cfor going through this.\u201d During allocution, Maxwell told the trial court, \u201cI\u2019m sorry for the tragedy.\u201d Yet Dr. McPherson testified that Maxwell maintains his innocence of the charges. Thus, Maxwell continues to deny responsibility for Nichole\u2019s murder. Maxwell\u2019s denials negate the mitigating weight that we might otherwise give to his expressions of sorrow. <em>See Hunter, </em>131 Ohio St.3d 67, 2011-Ohio-6524, 960 N.E.2d 955, at \u00b6 205.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-9\">{\u00b6 283} Finally, Maxwell raises residual doubt as a mitigating factor. Maxwell argues that his reason for shooting Nichole was jealousy rather than retaliation for her testimony against him. He argues that this is at best a mixed-motive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>case and makes the aggravating circumstance of retaliation less serious. Yet the evidence established that Maxwell murdered Nichole because she testified against him before the grand jury. Moreover, residual doubt is not a reason to overturn a death sentence. <em>See McGuire, </em>80 Ohio St.3d 390, 686 N.E.2d 1112, syllabus. Thus, we reject residual doubt as a mitigating factor in this case. The evidence does not suggest any other (B)(7) mitigating factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">{\u00b6 284} There is nothing mitigating in the nature and circumstances of the offenses. Moreover, Maxwell\u2019s history and background provide little mitigating value. He was raised by a loving mother and was surrounded by a supportive family and friends.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">{\u00b6 285} We weigh the aggravating circumstance of R.C. 2929.04(A)(8), the witness-murder specification, against these mitigating factors. Here, Maxwell murdered Nichole McCorkle in retaliation for testifying against him before the grand jury. Maxwell\u2019s mitigating evidence is weak in comparison. Maxwell has also refused to accept responsibility for murdering Nichole. We find that the aggravating circumstance outweighs the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">{\u00b6 286} Finally, the death sentence is both appropriate and proportionate. <em>See Fry, </em>125 Ohio St.3d 163, 2010-Ohio-1017, 926 N.E.2d 1239, at \u00b6 235 (murder in retaliation for testimony); <em>State v. Bethel, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 416, 2006-Ohio-4853, 854 N.E.2d 150, \u00b6212 (murder to prevent testimony in an upcoming murder trial); <em>State v. Turner, </em>105 Ohio St.3d 331, 2005-Ohio-1938, 826 N.E.2d 266, \u00b6 101 (murder in retaliation for filing domestic-violence charges).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">Y.

Ohio\u2019s statutory scheme makes clear that an autopsy is intended to serve <em>two </em>distinct purposes: (1) investigation of homicides and other crimes and (2) investigation of publich\u00e9alth concerns. R.C. 313.131(C)(1) (\u201cAn autopsy is a compelling public necessity if it is necessary to the conduct of an investigation by law enforcement officials of a homicide or suspected homicide, or any other criminal investigation, or is necessary to establish the cause of the deceased person\u2019s death for the purpose of protecting against an immediate and substantial threat to the public health\u201d). To determine which purpose takes precedence in any given case, we must look to the facts of that particular case. Here, police responded to a shooting. The coroner received the body of a victim who had been shot twice in the head. Common sense tells us that the coroner was not investigating a mysterious public-health epidemic. He was investigating a homicide and would have clearly expected his report to be used in a subsequent murder trial. Thus, in this case, the report was testimonial.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">{\u00b6 290} I agree with the majority\u2019s independent review of the imposition of the death penalty, however, and would affirm on those grounds.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b178-6\">Pfeifer, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AL\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">{\u00b6 291} I dissent from the imposition of the death penalty in this case.

Ultimately, I concur in that part of the majority\u2019s judgment that affirms the conviction because I believe that although both the admission of Dr. David Dolinak\u2019s autopsy report into evidence and Dr. Joseph Felo\u2019s testimony regarding Dr. Dolinak\u2019s autopsy report violated defendant-appellant Charles Maxwell\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to confrontation, the trial court\u2019s errors were harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b178-10\">{\u00b6 293} In its landmark Confrontation Clause case, <em>Crawford, v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 53-54, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), the United States <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>Supreme Court held that the Confrontation Clause bars \u201ctestimonial statements of a witness who did not appear at trial unless he was unavailable to testify, and the defendant had a prior opportunity for cross-examination.\u201d But the court left \u201cfor another day any effort to spell out a comprehensive definition of \u2018testimonial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>To some extent, we still await that clarifying day, especially in the area of autopsy reports; several state court decisions regarding the admissibility of autopsy testimony have been appealed to the United States Supreme Court, but to this point, the court has not granted certiorari on the issue. <em>State v. Navarette, </em>2013-NMSC-003, 294 P.3d 435, <em>cert, denied </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 134 S.Ct. 64, 187 L.Ed.2d 254 (2013); <em>State v. Joseph, </em>230 Ariz. 296, 283 P.3d 27 (2012), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 936, 184 L.Ed.2d 733 (2013); <em>State v.

But since <em>Crawford, </em>the court in cases like <em>Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts, </em>557 U.S. 305, 129 S.Ct. 2527, 174 L.Ed.2d 314 (2009), <em>Bullcoming v. New Mexico, </em>564 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 2705, 180 L.Ed.2d 610 (2011), and <em>Williams v. Illinois, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. 2221,183 L.Ed.2d 89 (2012), has provided enough guidance to establish that in most criminal cases, autopsy evidence is testimonial and implicates a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment confrontation right.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-13\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b179-14\">Admission of the Autopsy Report</p>\n<p id=\"b179-15\">\n<em>Melendez-Diaz</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b179-16\">{\u00b6 294} I write today as the author of <em>State v. Craig, </em>110 Ohio St.3d 306, 2006-Ohio-4571, 853 N.E.2d 621. In <em>Craig, </em>this court held that an autopsy report prepared by a nontestifying medical examiner created no confrontation-right implications because it was a business record; the court in <em>Crawford </em>had indicated that business records are, \u201cby their nature,\u201d not testimonial. <em>Crawford </em>at 56. This court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-17\">An autopsy report, prepared by a medical examiner and documenting objective findings, is the \u201cquintessential business record.\u201d <em>Rollins v. State </em>(2005), 161 Md.App. 34, 81, 866 A.2d 926. \u201cThe essence of the business record hearsay exception contemplated in <em>Crawford </em>is that such records or statements are not testimonial in nature because they are prepared in the ordinary course of regularly conducted business and are \u2018by their nature\u2019 not prepared for litigation.\u201d <em>People v. Durio </em>(2005), 7 Misc.3d 729, 734, 794 N.Y.S.2d 863.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number><em>Craig, </em>\u00b6 82.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">{\u00b6 295} However, the reasoning that an autopsy report is admissible as a nontestimonial business record was undone by <em>Melendez-Diaz. </em>The court held that the business-and-official-records hearsay exception does not permit an otherwise inadmissible testimonial statement to be admitted into evidence. <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>at 324. The court pointed out that although documents kept in the regular course of business are ordinarily admitted into evidence under the hearsay exception, they will not be admitted \u201cif the regularly conducted business activity is the production of evidence for use at trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 321. The records may have had other purposes unrelated to their later use at trial, but if they were \u201c \u2018made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial,\u2019 \u201d they are considered testimonial. <em>Id. </em>at 311, quoting <em>Crawford </em>at 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-6\">{\u00b6 296} The question of whether an objective witness who prepared an autopsy report would believe that that statement would be available for later use at trial is a difficult hurdle for the state to overcome in a case like this one, where the medical examiner autopsied a victim who was shot twice in the head. Any objective medical examiner would reasonably believe that an autopsy report that reflected the examination of a shooting victim would be available for use at a later trial. In the autopsy report admitted into evidence in this case, the cause of death on the front page of the report is listed as \u201cGunshot wounds of head. HOMICIDE.\u201d Could a medical examiner who makes that conclusion believe anything other than that the report will be available for use at a later trial? He could not. But this court has distorted the applicable test.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">\n<em>\u201cPrimary Purpose\u201d Test</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b180-8\">{\u00b6 297} Every autopsy report is not, by definition, testimonial. At least one court has held that if a coroner did not contemplate at the time of the autopsy that criminal conduct had occurred, then the autopsy report is nontestimonial. <em>United States v. James, </em>712 F.3d 79 (2d Cir.2013). The court in <em>James, </em>like the majority, employed a \u201cprimary purpose\u201d test in evaluating the autopsy reports. Before <em>James, </em>the Second Circuit had held that \u201cautopsy reports could be admitted as business records without violating the Confrontation Clause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 87. Recognizing that recent precedents like <em>\u201cMelendez-Diaz </em>and <em>Bullcoming, </em>and to a lesser extent <em>Williams, </em>call this categorical conclusion into doubt,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 94, the court concluded that \u201ca statement triggers the protections of the Confrontation Clause when it is made with the primary purpose of creating a record for use at a later criminal trial,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 95-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>{\u00b6 298} Applying that test, the court held that testimony regarding a nontestifying coroner\u2019s autopsy report in a case where foul play had not been suspected at the time of the autopsy did not implicate the Confrontation Clause. In <em>James, </em>multiple victims had died from poisoning. Dr. Corinne Ambrosi testified about an autopsy that was conducted on one victim, Basdeo Somaipersaud, by Dr. Heda Jindrak, who did not testify. The court concentrated on the fact that murder was not suspected by the medical examiner who prepared the report:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-6\">The defendants do not argue * * * that Somaipersaud\u2019s autopsy was anything other than routine \u2014 there is no suggestion that Jindrak or anyone else involved in this autopsy process suspected that Somaipersaud had been murdered and that the medical examiner\u2019s report would be used at a criminal trial. * * * The autopsy report itself refers to the cause of death as \u201cundetermined\u201d and attributes it both to \u201cacute mixed intoxication with alcohol and chlorpromazine\u201d combined with \u201chypertensive and arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-7\">The autopsy was completed * * * substantially before any criminal investigation into Somaipersaud\u2019s death had begun. During the course of Ambrosi\u2019s lengthy trial testimony, neither the government nor defense counsel elicited any information suggesting that law enforcement was ever notified that Somaipersaud\u2019s death was suspicious, or that any medical examiner expected a criminal investigation to result from it. Indeed, there is reason to believe that none is pursued in the case of most autopsies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 98-99. Because of the nontestifying medical examiner\u2019s lack of expectation of criminal involvement, the court concluded that \u201cthe autopsy report was not testimonial because it was not prepared primarily to create a record for use at criminal trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 99. The court concluded similarly about another victim\u2019s toxicology report \u2014 there was no testimony that a criminal investigation was contemplated during the inquiry into the cause of death. <em>Id. </em>at 101.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-9\">{\u00b6 299} The majority applies the primary-purpose test in a very different way from the court in <em>James. </em>The majority does not conclude that the autopsy here was not part of a criminal investigation; it could not reasonably do so. Instead, it states the categorical conclusion that autopsy reports in Ohio in general \u201care created \u2018for the primary purpose of documenting cause of death for public records and public health.\u2019 \u201d Majority opinion at \u00b6 57. That is, autopsy records are created so that we can have records. That makes no more sense than holding that the primary purpose behind the medical examiner\u2019s autopsy report was that his boss told him to do it, or so that he could get paid for the week.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>{\u00b6 300} The majority does not explore <em>why </em>the state requires coroners to document causes of death in cases involving suspected violence. A coroner in Ohio is statutorily interconnected with Ohio\u2019s criminal-justice apparatus. Pursuant to R.C. 313.12(A),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-5\">[w]hen any person dies as a result of criminal or other violent means * * * the physician called in attendance, or any member of an ambulance service, emergency squad, or law enforcement agency who obtains knowledge thereof arising from the person\u2019s duties, shall immediately notify the office of the coroner of the known facts concerning the time, place, manner, and circumstances of the death * * *.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">{\u00b6 301} Pursuant to R.C. 313.15, the coroner works with the prosecuting attorney and other law-enforcement officials to determine how long a dead body should remain in the coroner\u2019s control; a coroner must keep possession of the body until he has decided that he no longer requires the body to determine the cause of death or until he has decided that law-enforcement officials no longer need the body to assist them with their duties</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">{\u00b6 302} Under R.C. 313.09, \u201c[t]he coroner shall promptly deliver, to the prosecuting attorney of the county in which such death occurred, copies of all necessary records relating to every death in which, in the judgment of the coroner or prosecuting attorney, further investigation is advisable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">{\u00b6 303} Pursuant to R.C. 313.10(A), autopsy records \u201cshall be received as evidence in any criminal or civil action or proceeding in a court in this state, as to the facts contained in those records.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">{\u00b6 304} The coroner relies on law enforcement to provide information about suspicious deaths, consults with law enforcement on the preservation of evidence, and informs prosecuting attorneys when further investigation is advisable. It is not enough for the coroner to stamp \u201cHomicide\u201d on an autopsy report and file it neatly away. The coroner\u2019s verdict establishes the starting point for a homicide investigation and eventual prosecution by determining a primary fact: a person has died by unnatural causes, not by his own hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-10\">{\u00b6 305} It is before that statutory backdrop that Dr. Dolinak received the victim\u2019s body. She had suffered two bullet wounds to the head. Curtiss Jones of the Cuyahoga Coroner\u2019s Office Trace Evidence and DNA Department testified that after the body was received and prior to the autopsy, evidence was collected to perform tests for gunpowder and trace metals and to evaluate blood and fingernail scrapings taken from the victim. Certainly, a reasonable medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>examiner in Dr. Dolinak\u2019s position would have had to know that this case had criminal implications.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">{\u00b6 306} In a case in which a coroner attests that the cause of death is homicide, the medical examiner knows at the time he or she attests to that statement that that report will be available for later use at trial. The level of detail involved with the autopsy process demonstrates that the primary purpose of an autopsy in a criminal case is potential prosecution. If only the fact of her death was relevant, why was trace evidence collected from the victim\u2019s body before the autopsy? In <em>James, </em>the circuit court looked, as this court should, at the expectations of the coroner conducting the autopsy at the time \u2014 did the medical examiner anticipate that the case was a criminal one?</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">{\u00b6 307} Under the majority\u2019s holding, a court would never look to the expectations of a reasonable medical examiner to determine primary purpose. The state has done his thinking for him \u2014 he may think he\u2019s helping to solve a crime, but this court says that he is only trying to keep meticulous records. Under the majority opinion, no medical examiner ever creates an autopsy report for the primary purpose of creating a record to be used at trial. Instead, I would hold that whether a particular autopsy report is testimonial should be determined on a case-by-case basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">{\u00b6 308} The majority decision is based entirely on the word \u201cprimary,\u201d stating that \u201c[f]or Sixth Amendment purposes, it is only the <em>primary </em>purpose of a document that determines whether it is testimonial or not.\u201d (Emphasis sic.) Majority opinion at \u00b6 62. I do not agree that the word \u201cprimary\u201d deserves the artificial elevation that the majority gives it. It is not a part of the majority tests for expert-witness testimony in <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>or <em>Bullcoming-, </em>\u201cprimary purpose\u201d is not the common thread in the Supreme Court\u2019s jurisprudence on testimonial statements. <em>James, </em>712 F.3d at 108 (Eaton, J., concurring). The primary-purpose test applies to police-interrogation cases like <em>Davis v. Washington, </em>547 U.S. 813, 822, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224 (2006), in which statements made to police by witnesses are evaluated by the declarant\u2019s reason for making the statement. In <em>Davis, </em>which concerned whether statements made in a 9-1-1 call to police were testimonial, the court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-8\">Statements are nontestimonial when made in the course of police interrogation under circumstances objectively indicating that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency. They are testimonial when the circumstances objectively indicate that there is no such ongoing emergency, and that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">{\u00b6 309} I would hold that although the primary-purpose doctrine may apply to a lay witness who is in extremis at the time the statement is made, it does not apply to professionals regularly involved in creating statements used at trial. Instead, I favor the definition of \u201ctestimonial statement\u201d as enunciated in Judge Eaton\u2019s concurrence in <em>James-. </em>\u201c[A] testimonial statement is one having an evidentiary purpose, declared in a solemn manner, and made under circumstances that would lead a reasonable declarant to understand that it would be available for use prosecutorially.\u201d <em>James, </em>712 F.3d at 108 (Eaton, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">{\u00b6 310} Under that test, too, the autopsy report in this case would be considered testimonial.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">\n<em>Williams</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">{\u00b6 311} A consideration of the court\u2019s separate opinions in <em>Williams </em>establishes that another possible justification for finding autopsy reports to be nontestimonial, that the autopsy report does not target a certain suspect, has been foreclosed. The court set forth the factual scenario at issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b184-9\">In petitioner\u2019s bench trial for rape, the prosecution called an expert who testified that a DNA profile produced by an outside laboratory, Cellmark, matched a profile produced by the state police lab using a sample of petitioner\u2019s blood. On direct examination, the expert testified that Cell-mark was an accredited laboratory and that Cellmark provided the police with a DNA profile. The expert also explained the notations on documents admitted as business records, stating that, according to the records, vaginal swabs taken from the victim were sent to and received back from Cellmark. The expert made no other statement that was offered for the purpose of identifying the sample of biological material used in deriving the profile or for the purpose of establishing how Cellmark handled or tested the sample. Nor did the expert vouch for the accuracy of the profile that Cellmark produced.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b184-10\"><em>Williams, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 132 S.Ct. at 2227,183 L.Ed.2d 89.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-11\">{\u00b6 312}' The lead opinion in <em>Williams, </em>which totaled just four supporters, offered two reasons why the expert\u2019s statements were not testimonial. First, the out-of-court statements from the Cellmark report were related by the testifying expert solely for the purpose of explaining the assumptions on which the expert\u2019s opinion relied \u2014 that the Cellmark result matched the state\u2019s result \u2014 and were not offered for their truth. <em>Id. </em>at 2240-2241. That issue is discussed below in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>opinion\u2019s analysis of the surrogate-testimony issue. Second, and more relevant to the issue of the admissibility of the autopsy report itself, the lead opinion concluded that even if the Cellmark report had been introduced for its truth, there would be no Confrontation Clause violation, because the statements did not involve \u201cout-of-court statements having the primary purpose of accusing a targeted individual of engaging in criminal conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2242. The lead opinion explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-5\">Here, the primary purpose of the Cellmark report, viewed objectively, was not to accuse petitioner or to create evidence for use at trial. When the ISP lab sent the sample to Cellmark, its primary purpose was to catch a dangerous rapist who was still at large, not to obtain evidence for use against petitioner, who was neither in custody nor under suspicion at that time.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 2243.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">{\u00b6 313} In my dissent in <em>State v. Crager, </em>116 Ohio St.3d 369, 2007-Ohio-6840, 879 N.E.2d 745, a case involving the admission of a DNA test result performed by a nontestifying analyst, I attempted to distinguish the admissible autopsy report in <em>Craig </em>from a DNA test that I argued should not be admissible:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-8\">The Confrontation Clause \u201capplies to \u2018witnesses\u2019 <em>against the </em>accused.\u201d (Emphasis added.) <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 51, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177. A coroner is concerned with how the decedent died rather than who may have killed him. Thus, the coroner is not a \u201cwitness\u201d against a specific person when he or she prepares a report from an autopsy. A coroner\u2019s report is not done at the behest of the prosecution in preparation for litigation; it is done pursuant to statute. See R.C. 313.131(B).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-9\"><em>Crager, </em>\u00b6 107 (Pfeifer, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-10\">{\u00b6 314} But one thing that emerged from the fractured court in <em>Williams </em>is that a majority of the court rejected the notion that test results are testimonial only if the testing targets a known suspect. Justice Thomas, who disagreed with both of the lead opinion\u2019s rationales, but concurred in judgment, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-11\">The new primary purpose test [from the <em>Williams </em>plurality opinion] asks whether an out-of-court statement has \u201cthe primary purpose of accusing a targeted individual of engaging in criminal conduct.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 2242. That test lacks any grounding in constitutional text, in history, or in logic.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number><em>Williams, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. at 2262, 183 L.Ed.2d 89 (Thomas, J., concurring in the judgment).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">{\u00b6 315} Writing for the four justices in dissent, Justice Kagan stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-7\">[T]he plurality states that the Cellmark report was \u201cnot prepared for the primary purpose of accusing a targeted individual.\u201d <em>Ante, </em>at 2248. Where that test comes from is anyone\u2019s guess. Justice Thomas rightly shows that it derives neither from the text nor from the history of the Confrontation Clause. * * * And it has no basis in our precedents. We have previously asked whether a statement was made for the primary purpose of establishing \u201cpast events potentially relevant to later criminal prosecution\u201d \u2014 in other words, for the purpose of providing evidence. <em>Davis, </em>547 U.S. at 822, 126 S.Ct. 2266, 165 L.Ed.2d 224. None of our cases has ever suggested that, in addition, the statement must be meant to accuse a previously identified individual.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 2273-2274 (Kagan, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">{\u00b6 316} The concurrence and dissent establish that a majority of the court rejects the idea that a diagnostic test is not testimonial if it does not target a specific individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-10\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b186-11\">Testimony by a Substitute Medical Examiner</p>\n<p id=\"A9\">{\u00b6 317} The majority makes the unremarkable statement that \u201cthe majority of jurisdictions that have examined this issue have concluded that a substitute examiner, on direct examination, may at least testify as to his or her own expert opinions regarding the autopsy and the victim\u2019s death.\u201d Majority opinion, \u00b6 50. However, the testifying examiner is greatly restricted from revealing to the jury information from the autopsy report of the nontestifying preparer of the report. The testifying medical examiner in this case improperly introduced testimonial statements contained in the autopsy report prepared by the nontestifying medical examiner; he became a surrogate for the presentation of testimonial statements. <em>Bullcoming</em></p>\n<p id=\"b186-12\">{\u00b6 318} In <em>Bullcoming, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. at 2713, 180 L.Ed.2d 610, the court held that a scientific report could not be used as substantive evidence against the defendant unless the analyst who prepared and certified the report was subject to confrontation. \u201cAs a rule, if an out-of-court statement is testimonial in nature, it may not be introduced against the accused at trial unless the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>witness who made the statement is unavailable and the accused has had a prior opportunity to confront that witness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2713. The test in question was a blood-alcohol test involving a defendant charged with driving while intoxicated. The state attempted to enter the test results into evidence through the testimony of another analyst; the analyst who performed the test was unavailable because he was on unpaid leave for an undisclosed reason. The court rejected the surrogate testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">{\u00b6 319} The holding applies not just to the original analyst\u2019s conclusions and opinions, but also to factual observations he or she may have generated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-5\">Most witnesses, after all, testify to their observations of factual conditions or events, <em>e.g., </em>\u201cthe light was green,\u201d \u201cthe hour was noon.\u201d Such witnesses may record, on the spot, what they observed. Suppose a police report recorded an objective fact \u2014 Bullcoming\u2019s counsel posited the address above the front door of a house or the read-out of a radar gun. * * * Could an officer other than the one who saw the number on the house or gun present the information in court \u2014 so long as that officer was equipped to testify about any technology the observing officer deployed and the police department\u2019s standard operating procedures? As our precedent makes plain, the answer is emphatically \u201cNo.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-6\"><em>Bullcoming </em>at 2715.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">{\u00b6 320} Therefore, as the court held in <em>Commonwealth v. Phim, </em>462 Mass. 470, 479, 969 N.E.2d 663 (2012), a substitute medical examiner cannot testify as to statements of fact contained in an autopsy report:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-8\">Consistent with the Sixth Amendment and traditional protections against hearsay * * * a substitute medical examiner may not testify on direct examination to the facts, data, and conclusions stated in an autopsy report. * * * Accordingly, the prosecutor should not have elicited testimony on the description of the fatal wound contained in the nontestifying medical examiner\u2019s files, or of the victim\u2019s weight, height, and general physical condition.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">\n<em>Williams</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b187-10\">{\u00b6 321} Nor can factual statements contained in an autopsy report be admitted into evidence as forming the basis of the substitute medical examiner\u2019s expert testimony. <em>Navarette, </em>2013-NMSC-03, 294 P.3d 435, \u00b6 13 and 19. The court in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number><em>Navarette </em>derived that conclusion from <em>Williams, </em>based upon the rejection by five members of the court in <em>Williams </em>of the lead opinion\u2019s assertion that \u201can out-of-court statement that supports an expert witness\u2019s opinion is not offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted, but is only offered as the basis for the expert\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>Navarette </em>at \u00b6 13. Justice Thomas\u2019s concurrence and the dissent of Justice Kagan together establish that conclusion. Justice Thomas wrote that \u201cstatements introduced to explain the basis of an expert\u2019s opinion are not introduced for a plausible nonhearsay purpose. There is no meaningful distinction between disclosing an out-of-court statement so that the factfinder may evaluate the expert\u2019s opinion and disclosing that statement for its truth.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. at 2257, 183 L.Ed.2d 89 (Thomas, J., concurring in the judgment). Justice Kagan wrote for the four dissenters:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-7\">[W]hen a witness, expert or otherwise, repeats an out-of-court statement as the basis for a conclusion,* * * the statement\u2019s utility is then dependent on its truth. If the statement is true, then the conclusion based on it is probably true; if not, not. So to determine the validity of the witness\u2019s conclusion, the factfinder must assess the truth of the out-of-court statement on which it relies. That is why the principal modern treatise on evidence variously calls the idea that such \u201cbasis evidence\u201d comes in not for its truth, but only to help the factfinder evaluate an expert\u2019s opinion \u201cvery weak,\u201d \u201cfactually implausible,\u201d \u201cnonsense,\u201d and \u201csheer fiction.\u201d D. Kaye, D. Bernstein, <em>&amp; </em>J. Mnookin, The New Wigmore: Expert Evidence \u00a7 4.10.1, pp. 196-197 (2d ed.2011); <em>id., </em>\u00a7 4.11.6, at 24 (Supp.2012).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 2268-2269 (Kagan, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b188-9\">\n<em>Dr. Felo\u2019s Testimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b188-10\">{\u00b6 322} In this case, at trial, Dr. Felo was encouraged by the state to review the autopsy report on the witness stand and to reveal the report\u2019s findings to the jury. For instance, from the autopsy report, he related:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-11\">And on the external surface of her body were some \u2014 three identifying tattoos, some evidence of medical therapy, and two specific injuries of the head. Each of those injuries were gunshot wounds with one injury, one gunshot wound within the right eyebrow, and the second gunshot wound through the left ear and into the skull near the ear on the left.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-12\">He also testified as to the internal examination conducted by Dr. Dolinak:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>Specifically there was a broken portion of the skull where the right forehead and eye socket is, there was a tear going through the right eyeball, and then in the brain there was some evidence of some bleeding and bruising caused by the bullets going into the skull and striking the brain.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">{\u00b6 323} The state also inquired regarding whether Dr. Dolinak had performed any microscopic evaluation of the body, and Dr. Felo responded, \u201cSamples were examined underneath the microscope of the brain which documented the tears and bleeding of the brain caused by bullets going through the brain.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">{\u00b6 324} I would conclude that the admission of the information contained in the autopsy report prepared by Dr. Dolinak through Dr. Felo\u2019s testimony violated Maxwell\u2019s confrontation rights. The Sixth Amendment does not countenance surrogate testimony, nor does it allow the admission of testimonial statements prepared by nontestifying experts to serve as the basis of a testifying expert witness\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">{\u00b6 325} Just because the Confrontation Clause would not allow Dr. Felo to testify regarding Dr. Dolinak\u2019s work does not mean that the Confrontation Clause would prohibit Dr. Felo\u2019s testimony altogether. I agree with the court in <em>Navarette </em>that a substitute medical examiner could testify regarding certain materials within an autopsy file:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-9\">This is not to say that all material contained within an autopsy file is testimonial and therefore inadmissible. Without attempting to catalogue all material in a file that could be admissible, we note that an expert witness may express an independent opinion regarding his or her interpretation of raw data without offending the Confrontation Clause. * * * For example, in this case, after being shown the autopsy photographs, [the substitute medical examiner] expressed his own opinion about the entry and exit wounds, explaining the basis for his opinion. He did not simply parrot the opinion or subjective statement of the pathologist who performed the autopsy and took the photographs. Thus, he was available for cross-examination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-10\"><em>Navarette, </em>2013-NMSC-003, 294 P.3d 435, \u00b622. In this case, too, Dr. Felo testified about his own conclusions regarding McCorkle\u2019s wounds while viewing autopsy photographs. To that extent, his testimony was proper under the Confrontation Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>c</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">Other Jurisdictions</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">{\u00b6 326} On the federal level, the Eleventh and D.C. Circuits, in <em>United States v. </em>Ignasiak, 667 F.3d 1217, 1231 (11th Cir.2012), and <em>United States v. Moore, </em>651 F.3d 30, 72-73 (D.C.Cir.2011), have held that forensic pathology reports are testimonial for Confrontation Clause purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">{\u00b6 327} Further, at least eight state courts of last resort also find that autopsy reports are testimonial. <em>State v. Locklear, </em>363 N.C. 438, 452, 681 S.E.2d 293 (2009); <em>Navarette; State v. Kennedy, </em>229 W.Va. 756, 735 S.E.2d 905 (2012); <em>Commonwealth v. Reavis, </em>465 Mass. 875, 992 N.E.2d 304 (2013); <em>People v. Childs, </em>491 Mich. 906, 810 N.W.2d 563 (2012); <em>Cuesta-Rodriguez v.

Medical examiners die, they retire, and they move between jurisdictions. The nontestifying medical examiner who performed the autopsy in this case, Dr. Dolinak, is perhaps the poster child for the issue. In <em>Wood, </em>299 S.W.3d 200, the tables were turned: Dr. Dolinak, since moved to Texas, testified instead of the medical examiner who conducted the autopsy. The Texas Court of Appeals held that Dr. Dolinak improperly revealed contents of the nontestifying medical examiner\u2019s autopsy report in his testimony: \u201cUnder the circumstances of this case, the disclosure of the out-of-court testimonial statements underlying Dr. Dolinak\u2019s opinions, even if only for the ostensible purpose of explaining and supporting those opinions, constituted the use of the testimonial statements to prove the truth of the matters stated in violation of the Confrontation Clause.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 213.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-12\">{\u00b6 329} Although the United States Supreme Court has not dealt squarely with the issue, in the corners and footnotes of <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>the majority and dissenters frame the practical concerns about the admissibility or inadmissibility of autopsy reports. Writing for the four dissenters in <em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>Justice Kennedy mentions the autopsy report as the drum major in a parade of horribles created by the majority decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>[T]he range of other scientific tests that may be affected by the Court\u2019s new confrontation right is staggering. See, <em>e.g., </em>Comment, Toward a Definition of \u201cTestimonial\u201d: How Autopsy Reports Do Not Embody the Qualities of a Testimonial Statement, 96 Cal. L.Rev. 1093, 1094, 1115 (2008) (noting that every court <em>post-Crawford </em>has held that autopsy reports are not testimonial, and warning that a contrary rule would \u201ceffectively functio[n] as a statute of limitations for murder\u201d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-5\"><em>Melendez-Diaz, </em>557 U.S. at 335, 129 S.Ct. 2527, 2546,174 L.Ed.2d 314.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">{\u00b6 330} Justice Scalia, writing for the majority, addresses the dissenters\u2019 claim that confrontation is not the only way to challenge forensic testing: \u201cRespondent and the dissent may be right that there are other ways \u2014 and in some cases better ways \u2014 to challenge or verify the results of a forensic test.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 318. But the majority adds in a footnote, \u201cThough surely not always. Some forensic analyses, such as autopsies and breathalyzer tests, cannot be repeated, and the specimens used for other analyses have often been lost or degraded.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at fn. 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">{\u00b6 331} These excerpts from <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>frame the concerns about autopsy reports. On the one hand, there is the concern that autopsy reports can last only as long as a preparer survives or stays within the jurisdiction. On the other hand, if the person who performed the autopsy is not available to testify, a defendant is powerless to rebut the findings of the one medical examiner who, in most cases, is the only person who will ever perform an autopsy on the victim in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-8\">{\u00b6 332} In my mind, the \u201cstatute of limitations on murder\u201d belies the argument for autopsy reports being nontestimonial. If having no autopsy report available makes a murder conviction impossible, elevating an autopsy to a central role in a murder trial, does that not make it all the more imperative that a defendant have an opportunity to call into doubt the veracity of the report through cross-examination?</p>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">{\u00b6 333} In reality, in most cases, like this one, the autopsy report will not affect the trial in a meaningful way. But there are other cases in which autopsy testimony will be crucial. There are innumerable conclusions that a coroner could make in an autopsy report \u2014 cause of death, time of death, whether certain injuries are antemortem or postmortem, the presence of defensive wounds, evidence of rape, whether a baby was shaken \u2014 that can implicate or exonerate a defendant. Further, the determinations made in an autopsy are not mechanical. \u201cAutopsies are also much more complex than the identification of a narcotic, and are more prone to shades of gray, as their outcome is a diagnosis, not a chemical compound match.\u201d Tsiatis, <em>Putting Melendez-Diaz on Ice: How Autopsy Re</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number><em>ports Can Survive the Supreme Court\u2019s Confrontation Clause Jurisprudence, </em>85 St. John\u2019s L.Rev. 355, 383 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">{\u00b6 334} \u201cMedical examiners are not mere scriveners\u201d and \u201cautopsy reports are the product of the skill, methodology, and judgment of the highly trained examiners who actually performed the autopsy.\u201d <em>United States v. Ignasiak, </em>667 F.3d 1217, 1232 (11th Cir.2012). It is the diagnostic, subjective nature of autopsy reports that makes them especially appropriate for cross-examination:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-5\">The crux of the confrontation issue \u2014 the need to confront and cross-examine the attending forensic pathologist \u2014 is that forensic pathologists are physicians. Physicians exercise judgment and make mistakes, whether they treat living, breathing patients or perform forensic autopsies. Courts that have adopted the view that forensic autopsy reports simply memorialize objective data are misinformed. Neither forensic pathologists nor forensic autopsy reports are fungible. Forensic pathologists would not necessarily report the same findings if each were, hypothetically, able to perform the same autopsy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Ginsberg, <em>The Confrontation Clause and Forensic Autopsy Reports </em>\u2014 A <em>\u201cTestimonial,\u201d </em>74 La.L.Rev. 117, 168 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">{\u00b6 335} The cross-examination of a surrogate is thus inadequate for a defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-8\">The only vehicle by which a criminal defendant may explore the subjectivity involved in the performance of the forensic autopsy \u2014 to question the judgment of the examining forensic pathologist \u2014 is cross-examination. The in-court testimony of the surrogate forensic pathologist who examines the autopsy report prepared by the examining pathologist is an inadequate substitute. The surrogate witness is not the physician who was required to be familiar with the facts and the autopsy protocol, examine the victim\u2019s body, perform the autopsy procedure, make and report findings, and report the cause and manner of death. The cross-examination of the surrogate yields very little. The surrogate can rely on the autopsy findings with impunity. There is simply little to be gained by the defendant in the effort to cross-examine the surrogate. Cross-examination is the great truth-seeking test, but it is an empty exercise when the surrogate testifies at trial.</blockquote>\n<attorneys id=\"AcF\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>Timothy J.

If other forensic tests implicate a defendant\u2019s confrontation right, certainly an autopsy report should:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-7\">Both <em>Bullcoming </em>and <em>Melendez-Diaz </em>hold that a laboratory analyst\u2019s report of sufficient solemnity triggers the protections of the Confrontation Clause. It would be incongruous indeed, if an autopsy report requiring numerous skilled judgments on the part of a medical examiner, did not require the same confrontation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-8\"><em>James, </em>712 F.3d at 111 (Eaton, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b193-9\">{\u00b6 337} The central question in the most serious of crimes is whether the victim involved suffered an unnatural death at the hands of another.
