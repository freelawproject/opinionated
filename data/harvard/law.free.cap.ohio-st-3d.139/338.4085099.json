On May 13, 2013, relator, disciplinary counsel, charged Flowers with professional misconduct after Flowers, on two separate occasions and with her client\u2019s permission, signed her client\u2019s name to five affidavits and then improperly notarized the client\u2019s purported signatures on the affidavits.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-12\">{\u00b6 2} A panel of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline considered the cause on the parties\u2019 consent-to-discipline agreement. <em>See </em>BCGD Proc.Reg. 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-13\">{\u00b6 3} In the consent-to-discipline agreement, Flowers stipulates to the facts alleged in relator\u2019s complaint and agrees that her conduct violated Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(d) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice) and 8.4(h) (prohibiting a lawyer from engaging in conduct that adversely reflects on the lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice law).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-14\">{\u00b6 4} The parties stipulate that mitigating factors include the absence of a prior disciplinary record and Flowers\u2019s cooperative attitude in the disciplinary proceeding. <em>See </em>BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(a) and (d). The parties agree that there are no aggravating factors. Based upon these factors, the parties stipulate that a public reprimand is the appropriate sanction for Flowers\u2019s misconduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-15\">{\u00b6 5} The panel and board found that the consent-to-discipline agreement conforms to BCGD Proc.Reg. 11 and recommend that we adopt the agreement in its entirety. In support of this recommendation, the panel and board refer to <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Mezacapa, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 156, 2004-Ohio-302, 803 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>N.E.2d 397 (a public reprimand was the appropriate sanction for an attorney who signed a client\u2019s name on an affidavit with the client\u2019s permission and then notarized the signature as that of the client); <em>Cincinnati Bar Assn. v. Thomas, </em>93 Ohio St.3d 402, 754 N.E.2d 1263 (2001) (same); <em>Mahoning Cty. Bar Assn. v. Melnick, </em>107 Ohio St.3d 240, 2005-Ohio-6265, 837 N.E.2d 1203 (a public reprimand was the appropriate sanction for an attorney who notarized signatures on three affidavits even though he had not complied with the jurat representation that the signatures were sworn to and subscribed in his presence). We agree that Flowers violated Prof.Cond.R. 8.4(d) and 8.4(h) and, as stated in the parties\u2019 agreement and as indicated by the cited precedent, that this conduct warrants a public reprimand. Therefore, we adopt the parties\u2019 consent-to-discipline agreement.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AxVa\">Scott J.
