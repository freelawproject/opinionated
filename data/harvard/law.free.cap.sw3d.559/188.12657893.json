Over two years later, Nghiem petitioned to intervene in a suit against a company that made repairs to the plane before the crash, Global Aviation Service, Inc. The trial court struck Nghiem's petition as untimely. In a single issue, Nghiem argues that the trial court erred in striking his petition because his implied warranty claim was governed by\n   the residual four-year statute of limitations of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In June 2013, Daniel Nghiem and Rupom Sajib were injured in a plane crash. Sajib asserted a negligence claim against Global, a company that had performed maintenance and repairs on the plane before the crash.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   More than two years later, Nghiem petitioned to intervene as a plaintiff in Sajib's suit against Global, asserting a claim for breach of the implied warranty of good and workmanlike repairs to existing tangible goods and property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Global moved to strike Nghiem's petition, arguing that Nghiem could not intervene because his implied-warranty claim was barred by the DTPA's two-year statute of limitations. Nghiem responded that he was asserting his claim under the common law and that his claim was therefore governed by the four-year statute of limitations of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code. Global replied that the implied warranty of good and workmanlike repairs is not actionable under the common law but only under the DTPA and is therefore necessarily governed by the DTPA's two-year statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The trial court agreed with Global, struck Nghiem's petition, and severed his claims. Nghiem appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    Statute of Limitations\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In a single issue, Nghiem contends that the trial court erred in striking his petition in intervention. Nghiem argues that his claim was not barred by limitations because it was brought under the common law, not the DTPA, and was therefore governed by the residual four-year statute of limitations of the Civil Practice and Remedies Code, not the two-year statute of limitations of the DTPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Applicable law and standard of review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The purpose of an intervention is to join a lawsuit that is already in progress.

App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 2015, no pet.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Foreman v. Pettit Unlimited, Inc.\n   </em>\n   , we held that a claim for breach of implied warranty of good and workmanlike repairs to existing tangible goods is actionable only under the DTPA and is therefore governed by the DTPA's two-year statute of limitations.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10008596\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/886/409/#p412\">\n    886 S.W.2d 409\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 412 (Tex. App.-Houston [1st Dist.] 1994, no writ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Our holding was based on\n   <em>\n    Melody Home Manufacturing Co. v. Barnes\n   </em>\n   , in which the Texas Supreme Court held that, as a matter of public policy, \"an implied warranty to repair or modify existing tangible goods or property in a good and workmanlike manner is available to consumers suing under the DTPA.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9972817\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/741/349/#p354\">\n    741 S.W.2d 349\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 354 (Tex. 1987). Although\n   <em>\n    Melody Home\n   </em>\n   did not expressly rule that the implied warranty is actionable only under the DTPA, it observed that consumers of services, unlike consumers of certain goods, do not enjoy the protection of any \"common law implied warranty scheme.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9972817\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/741/349/#p354\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9972817\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/741/349/#p354\">\n    at 353\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This observation led us to conclude in\n   <em>\n    Foreman\n   </em>\n   that \"the DTPA is the only way of pursuing an implied warranty claim for repairs to existing tangible goods\" and therefore that \"such a claim must necessarily be brought within the two-year DTPA limitations period.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10008596\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/886/409/#p412\">\n    886 S.W.2d at 412\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Since its issuance in 1994,\n   <em>\n    Foreman\n   </em>\n   has not been modified or overruled. Nghiem nevertheless contends that\n   <em>\n    Foreman\n   </em>\n   was wrongly decided and urges us to overrule the decision now. Citing case law from the Tyler court of appeals\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the Fifth Circuit,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nghiem contends that an implied warranty claim may be asserted under the common law, subject to the residual four-year statute of limitations set forth in the Civil Practice and Remedies Code.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. CIV. PRAC. &amp; REM. CODE \u00a7 16.051. Nghiem further contends that applying the DTPA's two-year statute of limitations to his implied-warranty claim would be \"against the public policy of adequately protecting consumers in complex matters.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   We recognize that courts are split as to whether a claim for breach of the implied warranty of good and workmanlike repairs may be brought under only the DPTA, but four Texas intermediate appellate courts-including this one-favor this approach.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <em>\n    Gonzales v.
