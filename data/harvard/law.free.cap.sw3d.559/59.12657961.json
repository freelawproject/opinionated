The parties settled child-custody issues before trial. Finding no error, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   An opinion would have no precedential value. The parties have been provided with\n   a memorandum, for their information only, setting forth the reasons for this decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   We affirm the trial court's judgment. Rule 84.16(b)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-16\">\n    Father's motion to strike mother's cross-response and reply brief is denied. Mother's motion to strike father's reply brief is granted. Rule 84.04(i) states in relevant part that \"[t]he respondent may file a reply brief in reply to appellant's response to the issues presented by respondent's appeal.\" In his reply brief, however, father again argues in opposition to mother's points on appeal rather than countering mother's responsive arguments to father's points on appeal.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
