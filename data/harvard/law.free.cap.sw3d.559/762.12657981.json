J.A., the child at issue in this appeal, was not present in the hotel room because he had been living in Oklahoma with his father for over a decade. This was not Foster's first encounter with DHS. L.G. and D.C. had been in foster care previously because of Foster's drug abuse and instability.

ABRAMSON, Judge\n     Melinda Foster appeals the January 3, 2018 Sebastian County Circuit Court's order terminating her parental rights to her three children, D.C., L.G., and J.A. On appeal, Foster waives any argument regarding D.C. and L.G. and addresses only the termination of her parental rights to her oldest child, J.A. Specifically, Foster argues that the circuit court erred in finding that termination was in J.A.'s best interest when he was in the physical custody of his father, Kevin Adamson. We disagree and affirm.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-9\">\n      This case began on November 28, 2015, when a child made multiple phone calls from room 252 at the River Valley Inn and Suites to the hotel's desk clerk, and the clerk contacted the Fort Smith Police Department for a welfare check. There were concerns that the children had been left alone in the hotel room. The desk clerk reported that despite numerous attempts by hotel staff to make contact to determine whether there was an adult in the room, their efforts had been unsuccessful. When the police arrived, the children were in the room with three adults, at least two of whom appeared to be under the influence of drugs. The police found methamphetamine, needles, a spoon on the bathroom floor, and a firearm in a duffle bag on top of a dresser. Foster, who was in the room, tested positive for methamphetamine and amphetamine. Foster was charged with first-degree child endangerment, among other charges.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-11\">\n      On May 12, 2016, the circuit court adjudicated D.C., L.G., and J.A. dependent-neglected and ordered that J.A. remain in Adamson's custody. DHS filed a petition for termination of parental rights on April 25, 2017. The court held a hearing on the petition on July 12, 2017.\n      <footnotemark>\n       1\n      </footnotemark>\n      The circuit court granted the petition terminating Foster's rights in an order entered on January 3, 2018. In doing so, the court explicitly considered the Juvenile Code's best-interest factors:\n     </p>\n     <p class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-12\">\n      The Court finds by clear and convincing evidence that it is in the best interest of [D.C., L.G., and J.A.] to terminate the parental rights of their mother, Melinda Foster.... In making this finding, the court specifically considered (A) the likelihood that the juveniles will be adopted if the termination petition is granted; and, (B) the potential harm on the health and safety of the juveniles caused by returning [them] to the custody of [Foster]. The Court finds that\n     regardless of adoptability, it is in the best interest of all three (3) juveniles for the parental rights of [Foster] to be terminated.... The risk of harm to these children if returned to [Foster] is both physical and psychological in nature. The best predictor of future behavior is past behavior. [D.C. and L.G.] entered foster care previously under circumstances very similar to those that existed at the time of this removal. The behaviors of [Foster] after [D.C. and L.G.] were returned to [Foster] in the Scott County case could have been life-threatening to [D.C. and L.G.]. Despite all of the services provided to her in the first case, [Foster] reverted to her dangerous life-style when [DHS] was out of her life. [Her] effort to rehabilitate herself and her circumstances during the second removal have fallen far short of what she apparently did during the course of her first case. These children have suffered emotionally and psychologically as a result of being returned to [Foster] in the Scott County case. They are currently making progress on acquiring emotional stability. That progress needs to remain on track. [DHS] is not seeking to free [J.A.] for adoption, as he is in the permanent custody of [Adamson].... The court finds that permanency has been achieved for [J.A.]. The rights of his mother have been terminated. He is in the permanent custody of his non-offending parent, Kevin Adamson. No services are needed for [J.A.] or for his father. The court does not believe that it would be in [J.A.]'s best interest to have contact with his mother.\n     </p>\n     <p id=\"p-13\">\n      Termination-of-parental-rights cases are reviewed de novo.\n      <em>\n       Hune v.
