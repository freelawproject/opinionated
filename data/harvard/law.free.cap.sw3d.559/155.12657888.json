On the Court's own motion, we withdraw our opinion dated August 3, 2015 and vacate the judgment of that date. This is now the Court's opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case involves claims for breach of the implied warranty of suitability and breach of contract arising out of a commercial lease. The jury found that both parties breached the lease, but the landlord breached first, and that the landlord breached the implied warranty of suitability. The trial court entered judgment for the tenant, UTSW DVA Healthcare, LLP (\"UT\"), against the landlord Rohrmoos, Eric Langford, Dan Basso, and Tobin Grove (collectively \"Rohrmoos\"). Rohrmoos appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Rohrmoos's appellate brief presents these eight issues:\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   (1) The parties contracted for an exclusive remedy that superseded the\n   <em>\n    implied warranty of suitability.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   (2)-(3) The trial court erred in admitting certain expert testimony and documents, without which there is no evidence or insufficient evidence that Rohrmoos breached the\n   <em>\n    implied warranty of suitability.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   (4) There is no evidence or insufficient evidence to support the jury's finding that Rohrmoos breached the\n   <em>\n    implied warranty of suitability\n   </em>\n   because there must be evidence of (a) defect at the lease's inception; (b) the defect must be latent and vital; and (c) the defect must exist at the lease termination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   (5) UT waived any breach of the\n   <em>\n    implied warranty\n   </em>\n   by remaining on the property for three years after discovering the alleged breach.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   (6) The trial court erred in awarding UT attorney's fees because (a) the lease allegedly does not provide for attorneys' fees to UT; (b) UT cannot recover its attorneys' fees under the declaratory judgment statute because UT allegedly abandoned its declaratory judgment claim; and (c) there is no evidence supporting the fee amounts the jury found.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   (7) The trial court erroneously refused to disregard the jury's answers to questions 1-6 in the charge because those answers are either unsupported by the evidence, or they are matters of law which the court is solely responsible for determining; and\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   (8) The trial court should have entered judgment against UT because there is evidence that UT breached the lease and Rohrmoos's damages evidence was uncontroverted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   For the reasons discussed below, we affirm the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The facts are detailed, and the record is extensive. But we discuss the facts generally because we decide this case on settled legal principles that do not need a detailed factual discussion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    Water Problems\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   This case revolved around water problems in a commercial building UT leased from Rohrmoos to operate as a dialysis clinic. There were extensive efforts to determine what was causing those problems. When Rohrmoos did not solve the problem, UT moved out before the lease term expired.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    The Trial\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   After moving out, UT sued Rohrmoos and Langford for breach of the implied warranty of suitability and breach of contract.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   UT also requested a declaratory judgment that: (i) a casualty occurred in accordance with the lease, (ii) Rohrmoos failed to remedy the casualty and (iii) UT had the right to terminate the lease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Rohrmoos answered the lawsuit and counterclaimed for negligence and breach of contract. Rohrmoos also asserted several affirmative defenses, including waiver and prior material breach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   UT asserted the following affirmative defenses in response to Rohrmoos's counterclaim:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   (i) contributory negligence, (ii) failure to mitigate damages, (iii) termination of the contract was justified due to health and safety concerns; (iv) \"waiver or estoppel,\" and (v) statute of limitations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Before trial, Rohrmoos moved to exclude the testimony from an engineer UT retained, Mike Stenstrom, and letters he wrote regarding the property. After two hearings, the trial court allowed some of Stenstrom's testimony and all but one section of one of his letters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Other UT witnesses included the property engineer Boyce Farrar, the property administrator, a state inspector, the facility maintenance man, and other UT personnel involved in operating the facility. UT's witnesses testified about the water and flooring problems and the unsuccessful efforts to resolve these problems. Because the issues were not resolved, and UT was concerned about patient health and safety, it terminated the lease and moved the facility to another location.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Rohrmoos's witnesses included engineer Tom Witherspoon, a plumber, an architect, two architectural engineers, two real estate service professionals, two ceramic tile experts, two of the facility's medical directors, and others. In short, Rohrmoos elicited testimony that (i) the floor tile buckled because it was installed incorrectly and (ii) the water issues were not caused by a structural defect and did not render the facility unsuitable for a dialysis clinic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The case was submitted to the jury after nine trial days and with over nine hundred exhibits. UT did not seek to recover damages on its breach of implied warranty or breach of contract claims. Instead, in questions 1-3, the jury was asked whether Rohrmoos failed to comply with the lease (and whether UT waived such breach), whether UT failed to comply with the lease, and if appropriate, which party failed to comply first. Question 4 asked whether Rohrmoos breached the implied warranty of suitability and whether UT waived any such breach. The charge also asked questions concerning attorney's fees for both parties that were not predicated on any affirmative liability findings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Responding to the charge's questions, the jury found that UT and Rohrmoos both failed to comply with the lease, that Rohrmoos failed to comply first, and that Rohrmoos breached the implied warranty of suitability. The jury found attorney's fees for both UT and Rohrmoos of $800,000 for trial court representation, $150,000 for representation at the Court of Appeals, and $75,000 for representation at the Texas Supreme Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Based on the jury's answers, the trial court entered final judgment against Rohrmoos for the amount of attorney's fees that the jury found.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Rohrmoos subsequently moved to reform the judgment, or alternatively, for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The trial court denied the motion, and Rohrmoos appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   <strong>\n    The Appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Rohrmoos's appellate arguments largely center on the jury's finding that Rohrmoos breached the\n   <em>\n    implied warranty of suitability.\n   </em>\n   But, because we uphold the judgment on the prior material breach findings favoring UT, we need not (and do not) address in detail those issues premised on the breach of implied warranty finding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Rohrmoos's Second through Fifth Issues: Is the evidence sufficient to support the breach of implied warranty finding?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Rohrmoos's issues two and three argue that without Stenstrom's and Farrar's allegedly improper testimony and the complained-of\n   exhibits, the evidence would be insufficient to support the jury's finding that Rohrmoos breached the\n   <em>\n    implied warranty of suitability.\n   </em>\n   Likewise, Rohrmoos's fourth issue argues that the evidence is insufficient to support certain elements of the\n   <em>\n    implied warranty\n   </em>\n   claim. Similarly, Rohrmoos's fifth issue posits that UT waived its\n   <em>\n    implied warranty\n   </em>\n   claim by remaining on the property for three years after allegedly discovering the breach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   All of these arguments, however, are irrelevant unless Rohrmoos also defeats the answers to questions one through three, which support UT's prior material breach of contract defense to Rohrmoos's counterclaim. But, as discussed later, Rohrmoos does not properly challenge the sufficiency of the evidence to support the jury's breach of contract findings.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   And unchallenged jury findings are binding on this court.\n   <em>\n    Carbona v. CH Med., Inc.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8204903\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/266/675/#p687\">\n    266 S.W.3d 675\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 687 (Tex.App.-Dallas 2008, no pet.). Accordingly, because the answers to questions one through three, which support UT's prior material breach defense to Rohrmoos's counterclaim, are binding on us, we reject Rohrmoos's issues two through five, which we need not and do not address in further detail.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   TEX. R. APP. P. 47.1 ;\n   <em>\n    Zurich Fin. Ltd. v.

(where unchallenged liability finding supported judgment, challenged liability finding was not reversible error).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In addition, Rohrmoos has not demonstrated that the jury's affirmative findings on breach of implied warranty and waiver caused it any harm.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. R. APP. P. 44.1 ;\n   <em>\n    Lorusso v. Members Mut. Ins.

Rohrmoos does not explain how a jury finding that does not result in any damages or support the attorney's fees award could be constitute anything more than harmless error, if it were error at all.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   For the above reasons, we resolve Rohrmoos's second, third, fourth and fifth issues against it.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Issue One: Did Article XIII provide UT's exclusive remedy?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In an effort to negate the jury's finding that Rohrmoos breached the implied warranty of suitability, Rohrmoos argues that article XIII of the lease, which addresses \"casualty\" events, provides an exclusive repair remedy that superseded the implied warranty of suitability.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rohrmoos states\n   that UT \"initially sued under Article XIII,\" but then \"opted to invoke the [implied warranty] remedy rather than the nearly-identical remedy it agreed to accept in the lease.\" According to Rohrmoos, \"[b]ecause UT abandoned its exclusive legal remedy at trial, any judgment holding [UT] had the right to terminate the lease ... is wrong and should be reversed.\" We reject Rohrmoos's first issue for several reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   One, although Rohrmoos correctly observes that the article XIII \"casualty\" theory was not tried or submitted to the jury, Rohrmoos did not object to the charge on the basis that Article XIII was UT's exclusive remedy. Nor did Rohrmoos assert that argument in its motion for new trial or otherwise identify any other portion of the record where it raised that argument. Thus, the argument was not preserved for our review.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. R. APP. P. 38.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Two, without a proper objection, our review is based on the charge submitted to the jury, even if it was defective.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Osterberg v. Peca,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11456409\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/12/31/#p55\">\n    12 S.W.3d 31\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 55 (Tex.2000).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Three, implicit in Rohrmoos's argument, had it been preserved, is the premise that there is no part of the Lease beyond Article XIII that could support a finding that Rohrmoos breached the Lease. But Article VIII of the lease, captioned \"LANDLORD'S MAINTENANCE RESPONSIBILITIES,\" required Rohrmoos to maintain critical parts of the building that were at issue:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   Landlord shall maintain the roof, foundations, floor slabs, columns, exterior walls, imbedded plumbing, imbedded electrical lines (specifically keeping the roof free of leaks) gutters, downspouts and subfloors and all other structural elements of the Premises, together with the common areas of the Building including landscaping and parking areas, in good order and repair throughout the term of the Lease....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Rohrmoos does not explain why a material breach of this provision would not support a finding that Rohrmoos materially breached the Lease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   We decide Rohrmoos's first issue against it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    C. Rohrmoos's Seventh Issue: Did the trial court erroneously refuse to disregard the jury's answers to questions one through six because those answers are either unsupported by the evidence, or they are matters of law which the court is solely responsible for determining?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Introduction.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Rohrmoos's seventh issue complains that the trial court \"erred by not ignoring the answers to jury questions 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 when it entered judgment\" and globally asserts, by reference to a nonexistent volume of the clerk's record, that these issues have all been preserved for our review.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rohrmoos's ensuing one paragraph arguments regarding questions one through\n   four and six essentially state that the questions were \"unnecessary,\" \"irrelevant,\" or \"should not have been asked.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Rohrmoos's argument concerning question 5 is that the jury instruction on the implied warranty of suitability was \"legally improper.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   For the following reasons, we disagree with Rohrmoos's seventh issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    2. Rohrmoos's Challenges to Questions One through Three.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Questions one through three addressed the following matters:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Question One: \"Did Rohrmoos fail to comply with the Lease Agreement\"? The accompanying instructions stated, among other things, that any such failure had to be material. The instructions also stated that \"Failure to comply by Rohrmoos is excused if compliance is waived by UTSW,\" and further instructed as to what constitutes waiver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Question Two: \"Did UTSW fail to comply with the Lease Agreement\"?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Question Three: After conditioning the question on \"yes\" answers to \"Question 1 and 2,\" Question Three asked \"Who failed to comply with the Lease Agreement first\"?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Rohrmoos's trial objections to these questions and related instructions were:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-65\">\n   Question Number 1, defendants feel the issue should be presented as a separate question from breach.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defendants also suggest that there should be an estoppel question, or an instruction and definition on this question of breach.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-66\">\n   Question Number 2, this question is improper as the Plaintiff [UT] has stipulated that they breached the contract, hence this question is unnecessary. The question will confuse the Jury. There is no evidence in opposition that would allow for the no answer to this question, or there is sufficient [sic] evidence in the record to support a no answer to the question.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   Question Number 3 is improper in this case, and should not be given at all. There is no evidence that the Plaintiff [UT] did not breach the lease. The question is not relevant and the word \"first\" is ambiguous or vague.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Rohrmoos's total briefing as to Questions One through Three under this issue is as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     A. Jury question no.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   1 (SuppCR7) asked whether Rohrmoos failed to comply with the Lease. However, this is not relevant to the case because UTSW abandoned any claim for damages for such breach. The trial court should thus never have given the question, or should have ignored it when entering judgment. 10RR108[.] In addition, there should have been an estoppel instruction given separately or accompanying this question, but the trial court refused to give one. 10RR108\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Oliver v.

Introduction.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The jury was asked to find the reasonable amount of UT's attorney's fees for representing UT in the trial court, \"through appeal to the Court of Appeals,\" and \"for oral argument and through the completion of proceedings in the Supreme Court of Texas.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   To this end, the jury was instructed to consider the\n   <em>\n    Arthur Andersen\n   </em>\n   factors in determining the reasonableness of the fee.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Based on that question and that instruction, the jury found that UT should recover $800,000 for trial court representation, $150,000 for Court of Appeals representation, and $75,000 for Texas Supreme Court representation and the trial court entered judgment in favor of UT on these findings. Rohrmoos challenges this fee award.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Rohrmoos's sixth issue posits that the trial court erred in awarding UT attorney's fees because (a) the lease allegedly does not provide for attorneys' fees to UT; (b) UT cannot recover its attorneys' fees under the declaratory judgment statute\n   because UT allegedly abandoned its declaratory judgment claim; and (c) there is no evidence supporting the fee amounts the jury found. As discussed below, we conclude that UT was a prevailing a party within the lease's clause that permits a prevailing party in any dispute to enforce the terms of the lease and that there is legally sufficient evidence supporting the fee amounts the jury found in UT's favor. Accordingly, we need not discuss whether UT's fee award would be proper under the attorney's fees statute or the declaratory judgment act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   Attorney's fees may be recovered only if permitted by statute or contract.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    1/2 Price Checks Cashed v.

The Lease's Attorney's Fees Clause.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   The lease provides that the \"prevailing party\" in an action to enforce the lease's terms is entitled to recover its reasonable attorney's fees:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   In any action to enforce the terms of this lease, the prevailing party shall be entitled to an award for its reasonable attorney's fees.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Rohrmoos does not dispute that this case involved an action to enforce the lease's terms but instead challenges whether UT was a \"prevailing party. To that end, Rohrmoos cites\n   <em>\n    International Group Partnership v. KB Home Lone Star, L.P.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7300739\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/295/650/#p655\">\n    295 S.W.3d 650\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 655 (Tex.2009), for the premise that we should look to the civil practice and remedies code chapter 38 \"prevailing party\" concept, which requires that a party recover damages to be entitled to recover its attorney's fees in a breach of contract case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Green Int'l Inc. v.

Based on that premise and the fact that UT did not recover any damages on UT's breach of contract claim, Rohrmoos argues that UT was not a prevailing party in this case because it did not recover any damages on its breach of contract claim against Rohrmoos:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   Because UTSW did not recover affirmative relief or money damages, attorneys' fees may not be awarded under the contract or under Texas Civil Practice &amp; Remedies Code, Chapter 38.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   We disagree with Rohrmoos's argument because that argument misapplies the supreme court's holding in\n   <em>\n    KB Home.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   <em>\n    KB Home\n   </em>\n   was applying a contract provision similar to that in the lease, authorizing recovery of attorney's fees by the \"prevailing party.\" As in this case, the contract did not define the term \"prevailing party.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 653.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Despite that similarity, however, we cannot conclude that\n   <em>\n    KB Home\n   </em>\n   controls the issue in this case. There, KB Home was the plaintiff and sought over $1 million in damages.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 655. The jury, however, awarded no damages.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   As a result, the supreme court held that KB \"achieved no genuine success on its claim\" because it neither received anything of value nor achieved a material alteration in its legal relationship with the defendant.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   UT, by contrast, was not just the plaintiff, but also defended against Rohrmoos's breach of contract counterclaim. UT did not seek any damages. Instead, UT asked the jury to find that Rohrmoos breached the lease first, thereby relieving it of the\n   obligation for future performance and to avoid Rohrmoos's undisputed damages on its breach of contract claim. Rohrmoos's counterclaim damages were conditioned on an affirmative finding that UT was the first to breach. But the jury found that Rohrmoos breached the lease first and was therefore not entitled to recover damages. Unlike what happened in\n   <em>\n    KB Home,\n   </em>\n   these findings and the resulting judgment favoring UT \"materially altered\" the legal relationship between Rohrmoos and UT.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   For the above reasons, and because a prevailing party includes one who is vindicated by the court's judgment,\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

Sufficiency of the Trial Fees Evidence.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Rohrmoos also asserts that there is no evidence or insufficient evidence to support the fee award amounts because UT's attorney's fees expert offered no evidence of the\n   <em>\n    Arthur Andersen\n   </em>\n   factors and because UT's counsel did not submit his billing records. While we review the decision to award attorney's fees under the abuse of discretion standard, the fee amount, if awarded, is reviewed under the legal and factual sufficiency standard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hunt v.

He said that he has a very broad variety of litigation practice and that is all he has done for twenty years. His standard rate is $430 an hour and he has handled cases similar to this one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   On cross-examination, Howard clarified that the $800,000 fees were necessary for his client because they were caused by the actions of opposing counsel. But he also said had this case been handled by both sides in a professional manner, the \"attorney's fees should have been in the 3-$400,000 range.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   Rohrmoos relies on Howard's testimony that his fees were \"ridiculously high\" to argue that there is no evidence of UT's reasonable fees. This argument, however, ignores the testimony's context. Howard said that the fees were $800,000, and though he considered the amount \"ridiculously high,\" the fees were necessary because the activity in the case exceeded the norm. Examples of what he considered excessive activity included the designating of numerous experts, a high volume of\n   depositions, document production, and motion practice. Testifying that the fees in a normal case should have been lower does not mean that the actual amount was not reasonable under the circumstances.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   <strong>\n    (b).

The Texas Supreme Court, however, distinguished the lodestar method from a traditional attorney's fees award, stating, \"[w]hile Texas courts have not routinely required billing records or other documentary evidence to substantiate a claim for attorney's fees, the requirement has merit in contested cases under the lodestar approach.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7315665\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/370/757/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7315665\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/370/757/\">\n    at 762\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Moreover, in a subsequent opinion, the Texas Supreme Court further clarified that even under the lodestar approach,\n   <em>\n    El Apple\n   </em>\n   does not hold that time records or billing statements are the only method of proof.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of Laredo v.

Badger testified that \"reasonable appellate fees\" for an appeal of the case to the court of appeals would be $150,000 and a \"reasonable fee in a case of this nature for an appeal to the Texas Supreme Court\" would be $75,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-128\">\n   Neither Badger nor Bundren limited their testimony to what only Rohrmoos might incur on appeal. Instead, both testified generally about reasonable fees on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-129\">\n   Thereafter, the jury awarded both parties the exact amount of appellate fees\n   identified by these witnesses. We thus conclude there is some evidence to support the award of appellate attorney's fees and we decide Rohrmoos's sixth issue against it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   <strong>\n    F. Rohrmoos's Eighth Issue: Did the trial court erroneously refuse to grant judgment for Rohrmoos?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Because we conclude the trial court did not err in granting judgment for UT, do not reach Rohrmoos's remaining issue.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. R. APP. P. 47.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   Having resolved all of Rohrmoos's issues against it, we affirm the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-136\">\n    The two lists of issues in Rohrmoos's brief are numbered differently and do not correspond to the arguments in the text. For example, the list of \"issues presented for review\" includes an additional issue (numbered four) that asserts the trial court erred by giving an incorrect instruction on the implied warranty of suitability. There is no separate section of the brief that argues this issue; the only reference is within the body of the seventh issue complaining about the jury's answers to the charge. Therefore, we address the complaint about the instruction in conjunction with the seventh issue. We number the issues in the order in which they appear in the Table of Contents section of the brief and address the points raised in the body that reference these numbers.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-137\">\n    Although the Table of Contents appears to state this issue more broadly, the text of Rohrmoos's brief casts this argument solely in terms of the implied warranty of suitability.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-138\">\n    The live pleading at trial also includes claims against Rohrmoos general partners Dan Basso and Tobin Grove.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-139\">\n    Although Rohrmoos's eighth issue summarily argues that we should reverse the judgment and render judgment in its favor for the \"undisputed proof of loss,\" this argument claims only that the amount of Rohrmoos's damages resulting from UT's breach are undisputed and ignores the jury's findings regarding Rohrmoos's prior material breach. And although the heading for the argument challenging the jury questions on breach of contract and prior material breach says the jury's answers are \"unsupported by the evidence,\" the ensuing text does not make that argument. Therefore, we cannot address the sufficiency of the evidence to support the breach of contract findings.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Tex. R. App. P. 38.1.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-140\">\n    In addition, Rohrmoos's summary statements concerning the documents that it alleges were erroneously admitted (issue three) do not meet the requirements of the rules of appellate procedure.
