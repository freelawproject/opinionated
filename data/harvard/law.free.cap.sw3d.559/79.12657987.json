(\"Jay\") Ashcroft, the Missouri Secretary of State (\"Secretary of State\"), to reverse his decision to certify as sufficient Initiative Petition 2018-051 (\"IP 2018-051\") pertaining to medical marijuana. Bradshaw alleges that signatures in support of IP 2018-051 were not collected in the manner required by statute, and that as a result the Secretary of State should be enjoined from certifying the measure for inclusion on the ballot for the November 6, 2018 General Election. Because Bradshaw's petition fails to state a claim for compelling the Secretary of State's certification of the sufficiency of IP 2018-051 to be reversed, the judgment dismissing Bradshaw's petition is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    Factual and Procedural Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On or about November 28, 2016, Sheila Dundon (\"Dundon\") submitted a sample sheet for IP 2018-051 to the Secretary of State.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On or about January 5, 2017, the Secretary of State approved the form of IP 2018-051 to be circulated for signatures, and certified the official ballot title for the measure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On or about May 4, 2018, Dundon filed signature pages for IP 2018-051 with the Secretary of State.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Secretary of State thereafter sent copies of the signature pages to local election authorities to verify that the persons whose names were listed as signers of the initiative petition were registered voters in each election authority's jurisdiction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On August 2, 2018, the Secretary of State issued a certificate certifying the sufficiency of IP 2018-051 and that the petition contained a sufficient number of valid signatures to be placed on the ballot for the November 6, 2018 General Election.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Specifically, the Secretary of State found that there were sufficient signatures from Congressional District Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7, but that there were insufficient signatures from Congressional District Nos. 6 and 8.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On August 10, 2018, Bradshaw, a citizen of Missouri, filed a petition in the Circuit Court of Cole County, Missouri seeking a writ of mandamus and injunctive relief. Bradshaw sought to compel the Secretary of State to reverse his decision to certify IP 2018-051, and to declare that the measure could not appear on the ballot for the November 6, 2018 General Election.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Bradshaw alleged, on information and belief, that: (i) \"thousands of individuals ... signed [IP 2018-051] while not in the presence of the circulator;\" (ii) \"one or more of the signatures on [IP 2018-051] are not by registered voters in the district identified on the petition;\" (iii) \"one or more of the signatures on [IP 2018-051] do not state the signatory's name, registered voting address, city, town, or village correctly;\" and (iv) \"the circulators did not actually sign the affidavits in the presence of notaries.\" A preliminary writ of mandamus was issued, and the Secretary of State was ordered to answer the petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Dundon and New Approach Missouri (\"New Approach\"), a campaign committee organized to support IP 2018-051, then sought and were granted leave to intervene as additional defendants in Bradshaw's lawsuit. Dundon, New Approach, and the Secretary of State answered Bradshaw's petition. Dundon and New Approach (collectively \"Intervenors\") filed a motion to dismiss Bradshaw's petition for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The Secretary of State filed a motion to quash the preliminary writ of mandamus that had been issued. After these motions were fully briefed, they were set for hearing on August 30, 2018. During that hearing, Bradshaw withdrew his request for a writ of mandamus, and limited the relief he sought to an injunction compelling reversal of the certification of sufficiency for IP 2018-051 and enjoining appearance of the measure on the ballot for the November 6, 2018 General Election.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On August 31, 2018, the trial court entered its judgment (\"Judgment\") granting the Secretary of State's motion to quash the preliminary writ of mandamus that had been issued.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Judgment also granted the Intervenors' motion to dismiss Bradshaw's petition for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. The trial court found that Bradshaw's allegations were insufficient as a matter of law to support compelling the Secretary of State to reverse his decision to certify the sufficiency of IP 2018-051 as to permit the measure to appear on the ballot for the November 6, 2018 General Election.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Bradshaw filed this appeal on August 31, 2018, pursuant to section 116.200.3.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    Expedited Disposition of Appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   We have expedited the disposition of this appeal. Pursuant to section 116.200.2, if, following a challenge to the secretary of state's\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   certification of the sufficiency or insufficiency of an initiative petition, a court determines that the initiative petition is insufficient, \"the court shall enjoin the secretary of state from certifying the measure and all other officers from printing the measure on the ballot.\" However, if a court determines that the initiative petition is sufficient, \"the secretary of state shall certify it as sufficient and attach a copy of the judgment.\" Section 116.200.2. Pursuant to section 115.125.2, the last date on which late notification to local election authorities can be made pursuant to court order with respect to placing an issue on the ballot is 5:00 p.m. on the sixth Tuesday before the election. In this case, that deadline is September 25, 2018, the sixth Tuesday before the November 6, 2018 General Election. The parties have stipulated that the disposition of this appeal could affect whether IP 2018-051 is placed on the ballot for the November 6, 2018 General Election. Thus, the parties have stipulated that this appeal must be disposed by September 25, 2018, as the continued pendency of the appeal beyond that date would likely render the appeal moot.\n   <em>\n    Dotson v.

To review whether Bradshaw's petition was properly dismissed for failure to state a claim, we must first understand the extent of the Secretary of State's authority to review IP 2018-051 for the purpose of determining and certifying its sufficiency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     The Secretary of State's Authority to Determine the Sufficiency of an Initiative Petition\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The power of the initiative petition process is expressly reserved to the people in article III, section 49 of the Missouri Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Before an initiative petition can be circulated for signatures, \"a sample sheet must be submitted to the secretary of state in the form in which it will be circulated.\" Section 116.332.1.

The form of an initiative petition is required to include notice that it is a crime to \"sign any initiative petition with any name other than [one's] own, or knowingly to sign [one's] name more than once for the same measure for the same election, or to sign a petition when such person knows he or she is not a registered voter.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9101104,9101121\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/111/553/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Section 116.040 requires the form of an initiative petition to afford a place for each person signing the petition to provide a signature, the date of signature, the signer's address including zip code, the signer's congressional district, and the signer's printed name. Section 116.040 requires the form of an initiative petition to include a circulator's affidavit swearing and affirming under penalty of perjury that persons identified on the petition \"signed this page of the foregoing petition ... in my presence,\" and that the circulator believes each signer to be \"a registered voter in the State of Missouri\" in the county specified on the signature page. Section 116.040 requires the form of an initiative petition to afford a place for the circulator's affidavit to be signed by the circulator in the presence of a notary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   If the form of an initiative petition is approved by the secretary of state pursuant to section 116.332, the secretary of state is then required to post the sample petition on his or her website for public comment for fifteen days, after which, within twenty-three days of approval of the form, the secretary of state shall prepare\n   and submit to the attorney general a concise summary of the measure. Section 116.334.1.

Section 116.100 addresses the secretary of state's authority to accept and review an initiative petition, in pertinent part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   The secretary of state shall not accept any initiative petition submitted later than 5:00 p.m. on the final day for filing initiative petitions. All pages shall be submitted at one time. When an initiative ... petition is submitted to the secretary of the state, the signature pages shall be in order and numbered sequentially by county, except in counties that include multiple congressional districts, the signatures may be ordered and numbered using an alternate numbering scheme approved in writing by the secretary of state prior to submission of the petition.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Any petition that is not submitted in accordance with this section, disregarding clerical and merely technical errors, shall be rejected as insufficient\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . After verifying the count of signature pages, the secretary of state shall issue a receipt indicating the number of pages presented from each county.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   (Emphasis added.) In a related vein, section 116.060 provides that \"[e]ach petition page filed with the secretary of state shall have the county where the signers are registered designated in the upper-right hand corner of such page.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Section 116.120 also addresses the secretary of state's statutory authority to determine the sufficiency of an initiative petition. It provides, in pertinent part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   1. When an initiative ... petition is submitted to the secretary of state, he or she shall examine the petition to determine whether it complies with the Constitution of Missouri and with this chapter. Signatures on petition pages that have been collected by any person who is not properly registered with the secretary of state as a circulator shall not be counted as valid.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Relevant to the secretary of state's obligations pursuant to section 116.120.1, section 116.040 provides that \"[i]f [the] form [specified by section 116.040] is followed substantially and the requirements of section 116.050 and 116.080 are met, [the initiative petition]\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     shall be sufficient\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , disregarding clerical and merely technical errors.\" (Emphasis added.) Section 116.050 addresses other requirements for the form of an initiative petition, including page size, the requirement that each page of the initiative petition attach or contain a full and correct text of the proposed measure, and the format and content of the full and correct text of the proposed measure. Sections 116.050.1 and .2. Section 116.080 addresses the required qualifications of and registration requirements for an initiative petition circulator (section 116.080.1), and provides at section 116.080.2 that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   Each petition circulator shall subscribe and swear to the proper affidavit on each petition page such circulator submits before a notary public commissioned in Missouri. When notarizing a circulator's signature, a notary public shall sign his or her official signature and affix his or her official seal to the affidavit only if the circulator personally appears before the notary and subscribes and sears to the affidavit in his or her presence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Section 116.080.2 thus reiterates form specifications set forth in section 116.040 relating to the circulator's affidavit, and the requirement that it be signed in the presence of a notary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Also relevant to the secretary of state's obligations pursuant to section 116.120.1 is article III, section 50 of the Missouri Constitution which provides, in pertinent part, that \"[i]nitiative petitions proposing amendments to the constitution shall be signed by eight percent of the legal voters in each of two-thirds of the congressional districts in the state[.]\" Section 116.120.1 authorizes the secretary of state to \"verify the signatures on [an initiative] petition by use of a random sampling ... [which] include an examination of five percent of the signatures\" on the petition. Section 116.120.2 provides that if the random sampling \"establishes that the number of valid signatures is less than ninety percent of the number of qualified voters needed to find the petition sufficient in a congressional district, the petition shall be deemed to have failed to qualify in that district.\" Section 116.120.3 provides that \"[i]f the random sample verification establishes that the number of valid signatures total more than one hundred ten percent of the number of qualified voters needed to find the petition sufficient in a congressional district,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     the petition shall be deemed to qualify in that district\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.) Finally, section 116.120.4 provides that \"[i]f the random sampling shows the number of valid signatures within a congressional district is within ninety to one hundred ten percent of the number of signatures of qualified voters needed to declare the petition sufficient in that district, the secretary of state shall order the examination and verification of each signature filed.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   To determine the validity of signatures on an initiative petition, section 116.130.1 authorizes the secretary of state to \"send copies of election pages to [local] election authorities to verify that the persons whose names are listed as signers to the petition are registered voters,\" which \"verification may either be of each signature or by random sampling as provided in section 116.120, as the secretary of state shall direct.\" Section 116.130.1 continues to provide that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   Each election authority shall check the signatures against voter registration records in the election authority's jurisdiction, but the election authority shall count as valid only the signatures of persons registered as voters in the county named in the circulator's affidavit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Signatures shall not be counted as valid if they have been struck through or crossed out.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Section 116.130.3 provides that if an initiative petition signer is determined by the election authority to have written the wrong congressional district number after the signer's signature, \"the election authority or the secretary of state shall correct the congressional district number on the petition page,\" and the \"[f]ailure of a\n   voter to give the voter's correct congressional district number shall not by itself be grounds for not counting the voter's signature.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Finally, section 116.130.4 directs that \"[t]he election authority shall verify the number of pages received for that county, and also certify the total number of valid signatures of voters from each congressional district which the election authority has been asked to check by the secretary of state.\" Section 116.130.4. Once local election authorities certify the validity of signatures on an initiative petition, the secretary of state is afforded no statutory authority to disregard the certification, save the limited authority provided by section 116.140. Section 116.140 provides that \"[n]otwithstanding certifications from election authorities under 116.130, the secretary of state shall have authority not to count signatures on initiative ... petitions which are, in his opinion, forged or fraudulent signatures.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Once the secretary of state has reviewed an initiative petition as required by section 116.120.1, \"if the secretary of state finds [the initiative petition] sufficient, the secretary of state shall issue a certificate setting forth that the petition contains a sufficient number of valid signatures to comply with the Constitution of Missouri and with this chapter.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Section 116.150.1. \"If the secretary of state finds the petition insufficient, the secretary of state shall issue a certificate stating the reason for the insufficiency.\" Section 116.150.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Summarized, chapter 116 bifurcates the secretary of state's authority with respect to the initiative process into two stages: the pre-signature collection stage and the post-signature collection stage. Bradshaw's petition does not challenge the Secretary of State's pre-signature collection approval of the form of IP 2018-051 pursuant to section 116.332, or the Secretary of State's pre-signature collection certification of the official ballot title for IP 2018-051 pursuant to section 116.334. Instead, Bradshaw's petition challenges only the Secretary of State's post-signature collection certification of IP 2018-051 as sufficient pursuant to section 116.150.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The secretary of state's authority to determine the sufficiency of an initiative petition submitted after the signatures are collected falls into two categories: (i) whether the initiative petition follows statutory requirements relating to the form of the petition; and (ii) whether a sufficient number of valid signatures have been affixed to the initiative petition to satisfy the requirements of article III, section 50 of the Missouri Constitution.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   With respect to the first category, the secretary of state is directed that an initiative petition \"shall be sufficient\" if the form required by section 116.040 \"is followed substantially and the requirements of section 116.050 and section 116.080 are met.\" Section 116.040. In addition, the secretary of state is directed that a petition which fails to submit all signature pages at one time, and in order and numbered as required, \"shall be rejected as insufficient,\" \"disregarding clerical and merely technical errors.\" Section 116.100.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   With respect to the second category, the secretary of state is directed not to count any signatures collected before an official ballot title is certified (section 116.334.4); not to count signatures from voters from counties other than the county designated on a signature page (section 116.060; section 116.130.1); not to count any signatures that have been struck\n   through or crossed out (section 116.130.1); and not to count signatures secured by an unregistered circulator (section 116.080.1). Beyond that, the secretary of state is required to determine whether all other signatures belong to registered voters, and whether sufficient valid signatures appear on an initiative petition to satisfy article III, section 50 of the Missouri Constitution. To do so, the secretary of state is authorized to ask local election authorities to certify the validity of signatures for their county. Although local election authorities are authorized to \"count as valid only the signatures of persons registered as voters in the county named in the circulator's affidavit (section 116.130.1), once they do so, the local election authorities are required to \"certify the total number of valid signatures of voters from each congressional district which the election authority has been asked to check by the secretary of state.\" Section 116.130.4. The secretary of state is required to accept the certification of valid signatures provided by local election authorities, subject only to the limited authority extended to reject certified signatures that, in the secretary of state's opinion, are fraudulent or forged. Section 116.140.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   With this statutory backdrop in mind, we turn to the allegations in Bradshaw's petition to determine whether they state a claim upon which relief could be granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Bradshaw's Petition Fails to State a Claim Permitting Reversal of the Secretary of State's Certification of IP 2018-051 as Sufficient\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Bradshaw alleges that the Secretary of State's certification of IP 2018-051 as sufficient should be reversed, and that the measure should not be permitted to appear on the November 6, 2018 General Election ballot. In reviewing the trial court's grant of the Intervenors' motion to dismiss Bradshaw's petition for failure to state a claim, the factual allegations in Bradshaw's petition that we deem true are as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   14.

For example, on multiple occasions, [IP 2018-051] was placed at retail establishments for individuals to sign without doing so in the presence of the circulator.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-55\">\n   16. Upon information and belief, one or more of the signatures on [IP 2018-051] are not by registered voters in the district identified on the petition.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-56\">\n   17. Upon information and belief, one or more of the signatures on [IP 2018-051] do not state the signatory's name, registered voting address, city, town, or village correctly.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   18. Upon information and belief, the circulators did not actually sign the affidavits in the presence of notaries for [IP 2018-051].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   We address these allegations in turn, mindful that to reverse the trial court's grant of Intervenors' motion to dismiss, we must find that the facts alleged, deemed true, meet the elements of a recognized cause of action.\n   <em>\n    Spencer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12187884\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/500/885/#p890\">\n    500 S.W.3d at 890\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In other words, the facts alleged, deemed true, must establish that the Secretary of State improperly exercised his authority to determine and certify the sufficiency of IP 2018-051.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   section 116.200.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The allegations in paragraphs 14, 15, and 18 of Bradshaw's petition relate to statutory requirements for the form of an initiative petition specified in sections 116.040 and 116.080. Sections 116.040 and 116.080 do require a circulator to swear and affirm under oath, and in the presence of a notary, that each person signing an initiative petition did so in the circulator's presence. However, neither section, nor any other provision in Chapter 116, authorizes the secretary of state to look behind a circulator's notarized affidavit to determine its veracity or proper execution. Instead, section 116.040 expressly provides that \"[if] this [initiative petition] form is followed substantially and the requirements of section 116.050 and section 116.080 are met, [the initiative petition]\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     shall be sufficient\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , disregarding clerical and merely technical errors.\" (Emphasis added.) Thus, although section 116.120.1 requires the secretary of state to confirm compliance with the requirements of the Missouri Constitution and Chapter 116 as a condition of certifying the sufficiency of an initiative petition, that obligation is necessarily tempered by section 116.040's unambiguous directive that an initiative petition \"shall be [certified] sufficient\" if the form specified by section 116.040 is substantially followed and the requirements of section 116.050 and section 118.080 are met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Here, Bradshaw does not allege that the circulator affidavits on IP 2018-051 were not signed. And Bradshaw does not allege that the circulator affidavits on IP 2018-051 were not notarized. In fact, Bradshaw concedes that IP 2018-051 contained signed and notarized circulator affidavits. Bradshaw nonetheless argues that we should disregard IP 2018-051's facial compliance with sections 116.040 and 116.080 because the Secretary of State was required to confirm that the circulators' affidavits and the notary attestations were truthful.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Chapter 116 does not impose this obligation on the secretary of state. Nor does Chapter 116 expressly provide that a circulator's dishonesty in an affidavit, or a notary's dishonesty in an attestation, will require otherwise valid voter signatures not to be counted.

To construe sections 116.040 and 116.080 as Bradshaw suggests would require us to ignore section 116.040's unambiguous directive to deem sufficient any initiative petition which substantially follows the requirements of section 116.040. \"Courts will reject an interpretation of a statute that requires ignoring the very words of the statute.\"\n   <em>\n    State ex rel.

It is true that section 116.040 was amended. Pertinent to this case, the statute added language to the specified form of the circulator's affidavit to reflect the circulator's acknowledgement that execution of the affidavit is under penalty of perjury. This language had previously appeared in section 116.080 RSMo 2000, but was removed from that statute effective November 4, 2014 and added instead to section 116.040.
