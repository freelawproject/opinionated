Accordingly, we are not persuaded by Hillman's argument, and we conclude that the County's immunity has not been waived under\n   <em>\n    Sabine Pilot\n   </em>\n   because its limited exception to the employment-at-will doctrine, allowing an employee to sue for wrongful termination, has not been extended to governmental employees who must show that immunity has been waived.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ochoa\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%207404594\">\n    2014 WL 7404594\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *7.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Next, Hillman argues that under the Michael Morton Act, the County has waived immunity in his suit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. CODE CRIM. PROC. ANN. art. 39.14 (West, Westlaw through 2015 R.S.). The County responds that the Michael Morton Act contains no explicit waiver of immunity for Hillman's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Michael Morton Act, which is codified in the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure article 39.14, provides that the State must upon the defendant's request \"produce and permit the inspection and the electronic duplication, copying, and photographing, by and on behalf of the defendant, of any offense reports, any designated documents, papers, written or recorded statements of the defendant or a witness, including witness statements of law enforcement officers but not including the work product of counsel for the state in the case.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%207404594\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   art. 39.14(a). Article 39.14(b) further provides that a party who requests not later than the thirtieth day before the date of jury selection is entitled to disclosure by the other party of the name and address of each person the disclosing party may use at trial to present evidence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39.14(b). In addition, article 39.14 provides that \"the state shall disclose to the defendant any exculpatory, impeachment, or mitigating document, item, or information in the possession, custody, or control of the state that tends to negate the guilt of the defendant or would tend to reduce the punishment for the offense charged.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 39.14(h).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Hillman has not specifically cited any subsection of article 39.14 that he believes waives the County's immunity, and instead argues that article 39.14\"makes it illegal for a prosecutor to withhold exculpatory evidence from a Defendant\" and that article 39.14\"in-and-of-itself provides [him] with the requisite legislative permission needed for a\n   <em>\n    Sabine Pilot\n   </em>\n   cause of action.\" We disagree. Hillman points to nothing in article 39.14, and we find nothing indicating that the Legislature intended to waive governmental immunity for suits against governmental agencies under\n   <em>\n    Sabine Pilot\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 39.14. In other words, there is nothing in 39.14 stating or implying that a governmental agency has waived immunity in a suit for wrongful termination and there is certainly not any language that would constitute a \"clear and unambiguous\" waiver of immunity.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Miranda\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9256802\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/133/217/#p226\">\n    133 S.W.3d at 232-33\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We overrule Hillman's sole issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    III. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   We affirm the trial court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-32\">\n    According to appellant, \"the facts in this case were never flushed-out in a trial, or otherwise, therefore the question at hand is not one of fact, but one of law.\" Hillman requested that we take as true the facts as set out in his brief as follows: (1) Hillman was an employee of Nueces County, Texas with the Nueces County District Attorney's office as an assistant district attorney; (2) while working on an assigned case, Hillman discovered some exculpatory evidence favorable to the defendant in the assigned case; (3) Hillman's supervisor instructed him not to disclose this evidence to the defendant; (4) Hillman objected, performed an independent investigation regarding ethical obligations of prosecutors and verified that it would be unethical to withhold the evidence from the defendant; (5) Hillman informed his supervisor that he would be releasing the information to the defendant; (6) Hillman shared the evidence with the defendant; and (7) Hillman was fired.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
