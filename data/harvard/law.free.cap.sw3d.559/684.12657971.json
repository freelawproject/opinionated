Severs and Lila Severs filed a lawsuit against their neighbors, Cross-Appellants Robert and Linda Gaudin, and their homeowners association, Appellee/Cross-Appellant Mira Vista Homeowners Association (Mira Vista) to prevent the Gaudins from constructing a second-story addition over their pool cabana. The Severses claimed that the Gaudins' second-story addition both substantively and procedurally violated the neighborhood's \"Declaration of Covenants, Conditions and Restrictions for Mira Vista\" (CCRs)-substantively because the construction was within a fifteen-foot side setback restriction in the CCRs and procedurally because it deviated from the design-and-construction approval process provided for in the CCRs. However, because Mira Vista's Architectural Control Committee had already approved of the Gaudins' second-story addition, the strategy of the Severses' lawsuit was to enforce the CCRs against the Gaudins vis-\u00e0-vis Mira Vista.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Gaudins and Mira Vista asserted counterclaims to recover their reasonable attorney's fees under the prevailing-party provision of article 12.05 of the CCRs and the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act, located in chapter 37 of the civil practice and remedies code.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2037.002\">\n    Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 37.002\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , .009 (West 2015). After the parties engaged in some discovery, the Severses nonsuited their\n   claims against the Gaudins without prejudice, and the trial court signed an order dismissing the Severses' suit against the Gaudins. The order also stated that the parties bear their own attorney's fees, which seemingly dismissed the Gaudins' counterclaim for attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The trial court disposed of the Severses' claims against Mira Vista when it granted Mira Vista's motion for summary judgment, but in doing so the trial court expressly did not rule on Mira Vista's counterclaim for attorney's fees. There remained confusion regarding the Gaudins' and Mira Vista's counterclaims for attorney's fees, which led to additional motions, hearings, and a three-page letter from the trial court explaining that it was denying the Gaudins' and Mira Vista's requests for attorney's fees because the court did not believe that any party had prevailed and that the equities of the case did not warrant an award of attorney's fees. Subsequently, the court signed an interlineated final order denying all of the parties' requests for attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On appeal, the Severses raise ten issues challenging summary judgment on each of their claims, but the Severses' primary challenge concerns their breach-of-contract claim under the CCRs. On cross-appeal, the Gaudins raise two issues and Mira Vista raises one issue with both seeking to recover their reasonable attorney's fees, which they believe were wrongly denied. For the reasons set forth below, we overrule the Severses' issues and affirm summary judgment on all of their claims, we reverse the trial court's denial of Mira Vista's request for attorney's fees, and we affirm the trial court's denial of the Gaudins' request for attorney's fees. Accordingly, we remand for further proceedings necessary to determine a reasonable amount of attorney's fees to be awarded to Mira Vista.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Mira Vista is Created and Governed by the CCRs\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Mira Vista is an upscale, multi-phase subdivision of single-family residences located in Fort Worth, Texas. Like many upscale communities, Mira Vista has CCRs that created the homeowners' association (HOA), that contain certain restrictive covenants, and that set forth the rights and duties of its homeowners and the HOA. Article 12.05 of the CCRs provides that any owner may initiate a legal action to enforce the CCRs and that \"[w]ith respect to any litigation hereunder, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorney's fees from the nonprevailing party.\" The CCRs do not, however, define \"prevailing party.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Article 10 of the CCRs established an Architectural Control Committee (ACC)-a body with authority to review and approve or deny proposed buildings, structures, and other improvements. Article 10 provides that when making its determinations, the ACC will consider such factors as the quality of the improvement's materials and workmanship, its aesthetic conformance with the rest of the development, and its location on the plot and possible effects on neighbors. Despite this authority, the CCRs explain that the ACC \"shall not have unbridled discretion with respect to taste, design and any absolute standards specified [in the CCRs],\" but it \"shall ... use its best efforts to balance the equities between matters of taste and design (on the one hand) and use of private property (on the other hand).\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Article 10(e) also permits the ACC to publish and promulgate architectural standards for guidance to homeowners for improving their property and states that such\n   standards \"shall supplement these Covenants and Restrictions and are incorporated herein by reference.\" Accordingly, the ACC published a set of Design Guidelines (Guidelines) in January 2007. Relevant here is section 2.1, which requires a minimum fifteen-foot side setback for each home, and section 5, which requires a design-and-construction approval process that includes, in part, the submission of building plans to the ACC prior to the commencement of construction. However, section 5.15 also gives the ACC the right to \"\n   <em>\n    waive or vary any of the procedures or standards\n   </em>\n   set forth herein\n   <em>\n    at its discretion\n   </em>\n   , for good cause shown.\" [Emphasis added].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II. The Gaudins and Severses Move Into Mira Vista\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On December 7, 2006, Robert and Linda Gaudin bought a home in Mira Vista that had been built in 2000 with an eight-foot side setback. This eight-foot setback apparently complied with the minimum side setback requirements at the time and was grandfathered in when the Guidelines were subsequently passed. Six months after moving in, the Gaudins submitted plans to the ACC to build a pool and one-story cabana-an entirely new structure that would be placed at the same eight-foot side setback-no closer to the property line than their existing home and conforming with all other guidelines and zoning requirements. Thus, the ACC approved the plan because the cabana and would simply extend straight back from the rear of the Gaudins' home.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Six years later, Jeffrey and Lila Severs became interested in purchasing the lot directly south of the Gaudins' residence. The Severses obtained copies of the CCRs and Guidelines, and influenced by the Guidelines' fifteen-foot side setback provision, the Severses purchased the lot on July 31, 2013, despite the facts that (1) both the Gaudins' home and cabana were openly and obviously only eight feet away from the property line, and (2) the Severses' own home was openly and obviously only eight feet away from the property line.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    III. The Dispute\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The instant dispute began on March 4, 2014, when the Severses noticed a construction dumpster in front of the Gaudins' house. After being notified of the construction without having approved any building plans, the ACC immediately halted construction, requested a building plan, and fined the builder $250. Three days later, on March 7, 2014, after receiving payment for the fine and a copy of the building plan, the ACC began evaluating the Gaudins' proposed improvement-a second-story addition above the existing and now almost seven-year old cabana. Because the renovation would not alter home's existing footprint-that is, the renovation was vertical and the structure would remain setback eight feet from the Severses' property line-and because the second-story addition complied with all of the CCRs and Guidelines' other height, material, and color guidelines, the ACC sent the Severses a letter dated March 11, 2014, informing them that the ACC was permitting construction to continue during its evaluation process and that there would be a March 21, 2014 meeting to take place at the Gaudins' home at 10:00 a.m. to discuss issues related to the construction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   The Severses attended the construction meeting where they learned that the Gaudins had not obtained a variance to complete the second-story addition within the fifteen-foot side setback. The Severses began contacting members of the HOA and ACC to voice their objections to the second-story addition. The Severses attended the April 1, 2014 HOA meeting where they asserted their objections that the Gaudins' second-story addition was built in violation of section 2.1's fifteen-foot side setback and that it would alter their view from, and impact the aesthetic value of, their backyard and pool. In response, the ACC held an emergency meeting on April 3, 2014, which was attended by Mrs. Gaudin and the Severses and their respective counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The ACC then held another meeting on April 16, 2014 to resolve the issue. In an April 17, 2014 letter, the ACC explained that it had considered the Severses' objections in their decision-making process but was nonetheless approving the Gaudins' second-story addition because it complied with the height, material, and color requirements outlined in the Guidelines and because neither the CCRs nor the Guidelines contain any provision related to view. The letter informed the Severses that in reaching this decision, all of the ACC's members had reviewed the Gaudins' building plans and personally visited the building site.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Although not included in the April 17, 2014 letter, the ACC later justified its approval because the second-story addition would not alter the Gaudins' home's ground footprint, which had been completed before the Guidelines' fifteen-foot side setback requirement. The ACC justified its streamlined approval process under section 5.15 of the Guidelines and explained that it frequently omits many of the cumbersome procedural steps when proposed projects do not include original construction. The ACC explained that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-29\">\n   [a] preliminary design submittal was not necessary to an addition for an existing house because no driveway, landscaping or additional foundation was installed. To do so would require the Gaudins to have incurred an unnecessary expense and unnecessarily delayed the project. The ACC does not require residents incur expenses in a remodel project simply to comply with steps intended for original construction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. The Severses File Suit Against the Gaudins and Mira Vista\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Having failed to halt the Gaudins' second-story addition through the ACC and HOA processes, on April 22, 2014, the Severses filed the underlying lawsuit and requested a temporary restraining order (TRO) against both the Gaudins and Mira Vista. In their application for a TRO, the Severses sought injunctive relief, requiring, inter alia, that the Gaudins' house \"must be returned to its previous condition and that no remodel construction can take place in violation of the 15 foot side setback restriction.\" On the same day, the Gaudins filed their original answer and counterclaims in which they sought recovery of their attorney's fees under article 12.05 of the CCRs, and alternatively, under section 37.009 of the civil practice and remedies code.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2037.009\">\n    Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code Ann. \u00a7 37.009\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The trial court denied the request for a TRO, and on June 11, 2014, the Severses amended their petition. Although the Severses\n   expanded their argument by claiming that the subsequent fifteen-foot setback in the Guidelines controls over the previously ACC-approved eight-foot side setback, they asserted no new causes of action and requested the same injunctive relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The trial court conducted a hearing on the Severses' second application for a TRO during which the following exchange occurred between the Severses' counsel and the trial court:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   [SEVERSES' COUNSEL]: Now, yes,\n   <em>\n    do my clients want -- in the ultimate world, I would like it to never have started. But we are where we are. So there's two things: Tear it all down, start back from the very beginning\n   </em>\n   , have a trial on the merits until you get to do it.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   THE COURT: Who pays for that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   [SEVERSES' COUNSEL]: I think the HOA does.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   I agree with [the Gaudins' counsel], the Gaudins, through their builder, submitted what the HOA told them to submit and the HOA said go forward.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   THE COURT: So you agree, then, that the Gaudins did not do anything wrong. They went through the process, they got their approval and they didn't do anything wrong?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   [SEVERSES' COUNSEL]: Well, from my understanding of building houses, the builder is the one who does all that.\n   <em>\n    So do I think that Mr. and Mrs. Gaudin actually did anything wrong? No, I don't think they did.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   [Emphasis added].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The trial court denied the Severses' second request for a TRO. The Severses responded by filing a second amended petition, adding a litany of tort claims against Mira Vista-including claims for breach of fiduciary duties, promissory estoppel, negligent misrepresentation, and private nuisance-in addition to their requests for declaratory and injunctive relief concerning the Gaudins.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The lawsuit proceeded to the discovery stage and in his deposition testimony, Mr. Severs acknowledged that because the Gaudins had indeed obtained approval from the ACC, the Severses primarily blamed Mira Vista and not the Gaudins for the alleged violations of the CCRs and Guidelines:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   [GAUDINS' COUNSEL]: What is it specifically that you think the Gaudins did wrong?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   MR. SEVERS: Specifically what the Gaudins did wrong other than -- other than the placement of their pool pumps and air-conditioning equipment, I'm not aware of anything else that they have done wrong relative to this construction. Okay? Now, there may be but I'm not aware of anything.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   [GAUDINS' COUNSEL]: And is that based on the fact that you don't disagree with the notion that they did get ACC approval for the remodeling projects on their home?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   MR. SEVERS: They did get ACC approval from what I understand, yes, but we -- we question if the guidelines were applied.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   [GAUDINS' COUNSEL]: And if there was deviation from the guidelines, it's not your contention that's the Gaudins' doing, is it?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   MR. SEVERS: Well, if the ACC approved the plans, then, you know, I would see that as being the -- the ACC's and the HOA's issue, not the Gaudins['].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Shortly thereafter the Severses filed a nonsuit without prejudice dismissing their claims against the Gaudins. Notably, the Severses' proposed order granting nonsuit included an order that the Gaudins should\n   bear their own legal fees, to which the Gaudins filed an objection. The Severses then filed a third amended petition and application for temporary restraining order, which no longer named the Gaudins as a party, but still included their requests for declaratory and injunctive relief that the second-story addition be taken down-relief that directly implicated the Gaudins.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mira Vista filed a motion for partial summary judgment on all of the Severses' claims, and the Gaudins filed a motion for partial summary judgment on their counterclaim for attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   <strong>\n    V. Attorney's Fees\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The trial court signed an order granting the Severses' nonsuit, dismissed all of the Severses' claims against the Gaudins without prejudice, and ordered the Gaudins to pay their own attorney's fees. On the same day, the trial court granted Mira Vista's motion for summary judgment and dismissed all of the Severses' claims against it but expressly did not rule on Mira Vista's counterclaim for attorney's fees. The Gaudins filed a motion to vacate the court's order on the Severses' nonsuit, and Mira Vista filed a motion for summary judgment and amended motion for summary judgment on its counterclaim for attorney's fees. After conducting several hearings, the trial court sent the parties a letter dated December 21, 2015, stating that it was denying both the Gaudins' motion to vacate and Mira Vista's motion for summary judgment on attorney's fees. The trial court explained that because \"no party prevailed in this matter\" under article 12.05 of the CCRs and because awarding attorney's fees is discretionary under section 37.009 of the civil practice and remedies code and the court did not believe the equities in the case warranted such, it was not awarding any party attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   The parties apparently remained confused, so Mira Vista filed a motion to reconsider and the Severses filed a motion for summary judgment on attorney's fees. The trial court held a status conference to clarify its position and then on April 19, 2016, signed an interlineated final order denying all parties' requests for attorney's fees. Each party timely appealed. The Severses challenge the trial court's summary judgment as to all of their claims against Mira Vista and the Gaudins and Mira Vista challenge the trial court's order denying their request for attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     STANDARD OF REVIEW\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   We review a summary judgment de novo.\n   <em>\n    Travelers Ins.

Breach of Contract\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The Severses believe that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on their breach-of-contract claim because it misconstrued the language contained in the CCRs and Guidelines. The Severses claim Mira Vista's actions were arbitrary and capricious in reasoning that the two-story addition to the Gaudins' home would not change the already-existing footprint with an eight-foot side setback, even though the Guidelines restrict construction within a fifteen-foot setback. The Severses' contention appears to be that because the Gaudins' home, as already constructed fourteen years earlier, was already in violation of the fifteen-foot setback requirements, any additional construction within the setback-even if only building vertically and thus not altering the \"footprint\"-would still need to go through the requisite application-and-approval-of-a-variance process or simply be denied.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In response, Mira Vista contends that the Guidelines do not apply to the Gaudins' home as a \"phase 1 home\" and that in any event, Mira Vista can waive any such requirements. Further, Mira Vista asserts that a statutory presumption of reasonableness applies to their decision pursuant to section 202.004 of the property code and that the Severses failed to overcome the presumption to establish that Mira Vista acted in an arbitrary, capricious, or discriminatory manner.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%20202.004\">\n    Tex.

The ACC's Decisions Were Within Its Contractual Authority\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Although the parties advance several arguments, in our view, the Severses' breach-of-contract claim ultimately turns on the scope of the ACC's authority to vary or waive its standards and procedures for approving the Gaudins' second-story addition and whether Mira Vista thus violated the CCRs and Guidelines. That is, whether the fifteen-foot side setback requirement of section 2.1 of the Guidelines applies to the Gaudins' phase-1 home and second-story addition-an issue on which the parties vehemently disagree-may not be dispositive if the Guidelines grant the ACC discretion to waive any such requirements contained therein. Thus, we begin by examining the plain language of section 5.15.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Section 5.15 of the Guidelines states, in part, \"The Architectural Control Committee reserves the right\n   <em>\n    to waive\n   </em>\n   or vary\n   <em>\n    any of the procedures or standards set forth herein\n   </em>\n   at its discretion for good cause shown.\" [Emphasis added]. We make several observations about this language. First, section 5.15 of the Guidelines distinguishes between the ACC's right to waive or vary. This matters because the remainder of section 5.15 concerns the requirements for granting variances, which, inter alia, must be requested in writing. So, although it is undisputed that no written\n   variance was requested or issued for the second-story addition, the ACC would still have discretion under the Guidelines to waive-i.e., intentionally relinquish its right to enforce\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   -any procedure or standard should it apply. Second, the ACC may waive \"\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   of the procedures\n   <em>\n    or\n   </em>\n   standards.\" [Emphasis added]. This is a categorical statement that expressly applies to both procedures and standards. We read the fifteen-foot side setback of section 2.1 to be a standard, so the ACC could waive it. Similarly, any procedure for the approval of construction-i.e., presubmission and approval of building plans-could also be waived. Finally, the fifteen-foot side setback requirement that the Severses seek to enforce is located \"herein\" in section 2.1 of the Guidelines. Thus, the ACC could waive the side setback requirement in approving any construction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   We conclude that this plain language expressly grants the ACC discretion to waive any procedures and standards necessary to approve the Gaudins' second-story addition. Thus, we hold that the ACC was within its contractual authority to alter its approval process or any applicable side-setback standards via waiver-even if the second-story addition conflicted with section 2.1 of the Guidelines.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pilarcik\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11833909\" index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/966/474/#p478\">\n    966 S.W.2d at 480\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding that \"[b]ecause the Architectural Control Committee had the authority to waive\" certain roof requirements under the restrictive covenants, \"the waiver provided by the ACC was effective\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   We overrule the Severses' first and second issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    C. No Showing Mira Vista Breached\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The Severses also challenge what they characterize as the trial court's implied finding that Mira Vista did not breach the Guidelines. The Severses assert ten examples of Mira Vista's purported breaches of the Guidelines that would challenge an implied finding that Mira Vista did not breach the Guidelines. However, all ten examples concern various approval procedures under sections four and five of the Guidelines, and as shown above, Mira Vista did not breach the CCRs or Guidelines as any breach-of-contract claims related to the approval process and fifteen-foot side setback requirements are subject to the ACC's contractual right of waiver.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, we overrule the Severses' third issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   <strong>\n    D. Neither Decision Was Arbitrary, Capricious, or Discriminatory\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   The Severses have an additional burden to rebut the statutory presumption that the ACC acted reasonably in altering its approval procedures and approving the Gaudins' second-story addition. In issues four, five, and six, the Severses challenge the trial court's implied findings that the ACC acted reasonably.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   The property code provides that \"[a]n exercise of discretionary authority by a property owners' association or other representative designated by an owner of real property concerning a restrictive covenant is presumed reasonable unless the court determines by a preponderance of the evidence that the exercise of discretionary authority was arbitrary, capricious, or discriminatory.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Tex.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%20202.004\">\n    Tex.

Indeed, a review of the record reveals that the first action taken by the ACC was to halt construction and fine the Gaudins' builder upon learning that the Gaudins had begun the second-story addition without approval from the ACC. This demonstrated a willingness of the ACC to enforce the CCRs and Guidelines against the Gaudins. Further, the Severses were provided opportunities to voice their objections at the on-site March 21, 2014 meeting, the April 1, 2014 HOA meeting, and the April 3, 2014 emergency ACC meeting. The ACC then met once more, and only after expressly considering the Severses' objections, reviewing the Gaudins' building plans, and visiting the building site, the ACC notified the Severses in writing that it had decided to approve the second-story addition because it complied with all applicable height, materials, and color requirements, and neither the Guidelines nor CCRs contain anything related to view. The ACC also reasoned that the renovation did not alter the home's footprint, which was (1) approved of before the Guidelines were adopted, and (2) accepted by the Severses when they purchased the adjacent home in 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   We hold that the ACC's decision to approve the Gaudins' addition was not arbitrary, capricious, or discriminatory and that the Severses failed to produce sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption that the ACC's decision was reasonable.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Uptegraph v.

As held above, the ACC was acting within its contractual authority to waive its approval procedures, and the reasons it cited-namely, no new foundation work and compliance with all height, color, and materials requirements-reasonably support such actions.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7326000\" index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/312/918/#p935\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   We also note that even with an altered approval process, the record supports that each member of the ACC still reviewed the Gaudins' building plans and personally visited the building site.

Each of the Severses' Seven Claims Either Seeks an Advisory Opinion or Concerns a Contractual Dispute\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   None of the Severses' seven requests are appropriate candidates for declaratory relief. Rather, requests three through seven duplicate the relief sought under the Severses' breach-of-contract claims. The Severses do not request that we determine the parties' rights under the CCRs or Guidelines but instead ask for us to declare that that Mira Vista and the ACC breached when they approved the Gaudins' addition. Such a declaration is both duplicative, considering the Severses' breach-of-contract claim, and inappropriate under section 37.002 of the UDJA. Moreover, considering that the Severses nonsuited the Gaudins, there is no basis for this Court to grant declaratory relief on the Severses' third, fifth, and sixth requests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   Further, requests one through three effectively request advisory opinions because the evidence proffered by Mira Vista and discussed at length above demonstrates that the Gaudins' addition does not violate the side setback provision because the ACC had authority under the Guidelines to waive any such requirement. Thus, rendering\n   a declaratory judgment on requests one through three would be advisory because the side-setback guidelines were not implicated in the ACC's approval of the renovation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Therefore, because each of the seven claims for declaratory relief either concerns a contractual dispute or would constitute an advisory opinion, we overrule the Severses' seventh issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    III.

Moreover, the trial court conducted a September 25, 2015 hearing and held a February 19, 2016 status conference-both of which concerned the Gaudins' and Mira Vista's counterclaims for attorney's fees-and extensively addressed the counterclaims for attorney's fees in its December 21, 2015 letter before ultimately disposing of the issue in the April 19, 2016 final order. Thus, although the trial court's order granting the Severses' nonsuit and purportedly dismissing the Gaudins' counterclaim for attorney's fees (as well as its letter denying the Gaudins' motion to vacate) was in error, we conclude that the error is harmless because the Gaudins' counterclaim for attorney's fees was extensively briefed and argued and was disposed of on the merits in the April 19, 2016 final order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Accordingly, we overrule the Gaudins' first issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   <strong>\n    b.

The Gaudins essentially contend that the Severses' lawsuit against them was baseless from the outset and that this was admitted by the Severses and their counsel. The Severses respond that that none of the\n   <em>\n    Epps\n   </em>\n   factors are present in this case and that their lawsuit had merit and the decision to nonsuit without prejudice was not to avoid an unfavorable ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   As explained above, \"a defendant is a prevailing party when a plaintiff nonsuits a case\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   prejudice\" because a nonsuit with prejudice is tantamount to a judgment on the merits and its res-judicata effect thereby permanently and inalterably changes the legal relationship among the parties.\n   <em>\n    Epps\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7319200,7319171\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/351/862/\">\n    351 S.W.3d at 868-69\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Because courts disfavor nonsuits that are filed \"to circumvent unfavorable legal restrictions or rulings,\" the\n   <em>\n    Epps\n   </em>\n   court held that \"a defendant may be a prevailing party when a plaintiff nonsuits without prejudice if the trial court determines, on the defendant's motion, that the nonsuit was taken to avoid an unfavorable ruling on the merits.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 870. The\n   <em>\n    Epps\n   </em>\n   court provided some factors for courts to consider in analyzing whether a plaintiff has nonsuited to avoid an unfavorable ruling, including (1) the timing of the nonsuit, (2) if the plaintiff has an unexcused failure to obtain discovery of evidence that might disprove its claim, (3) the failure to designate material or expert witnesses, and (4) the existence of other procedural obstacles, such as the inability to join necessary parties.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 870-71.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   We do not find any of the\n   <em>\n    Epps\n   </em>\n   factors to be present in this case. First, the Severses' notice of nonsuit without prejudice was not filed after the Gaudins filed a motion for summary judgment. Second, there is no mention-let alone evidence or citations to the record-from the Gaudins that establish that the Severses had failed to respond to requests for admission or other discovery requests, which would thereby support an adverse judgment. Third, there is no argument or evidence to support that the Severses had failed to identify experts or critical witnesses that would make ultimate recovery impossible. Finally, there is no argument or evidence to support that the Severses filed their nonsuit without prejudice because of some other procedural obstacle that would have defeated their claims against the Gaudins.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   Thus, our analysis of the\n   <em>\n    Epps\n   </em>\n   factors supports the trial court's implied finding that the Gaudins were not a prevailing party because the Severses' nonsuit without prejudice was not to avoid an unfavorable ruling on the merits.\n   <em>\n    Accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Referente\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6769354\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/477/882/#p885\">\n    477 S.W.3d at 886-87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (affirming trial court's finding that nonsuit without prejudice was taken to avoid unfavorable ruling when nonsuit was filed after a motion for summary judgment was filed).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   Despite the absence of the\n   <em>\n    Epps\n   </em>\n   factors, the Gaudins direct us to a statement from the Severses' counsel made during the second TRO hearing, a statement in Mr. Severs's deposition, and a statement in Mrs. Severs's deposition that she was unaware of the Gaudins' counterclaim for attorney's fees to support that the Severses knowingly filed meritless claims against the Gaudins and only filed the nonsuit to avoid an unfavorable ruling. We cannot agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   It is clear from the record that the Gaudins did not comply with section one of the Guidelines because the Gaudins failed to submit their building plans to the ACC prior to submission to the City of Fort Worth and beginning construction. Indeed, Mira Vista fined the Gaudins' builder for this action and halted construction. Therefore, we conclude that the Severses' claims that the Gaudins violated the Guidelines were not baseless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   In light of the foregoing, we hold that the Severses did not bring a baseless claim and that the filing of their nonsuit without prejudice was not to avoid an unfavorable judgment and thus the Gaudins were not a prevailing party on that basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   <strong>\n    3.

That is, the Gaudins argue that even though the Severses took a nonsuit without prejudice, they still maintained all of their same claims and relief requested-including relief against the Gaudins-so, the Gaudins can essentially stand in Mira Vista's shoes as a prevailing party. Put differently, because Mira Vista is a prevailing party, the Gaudins are a prevailing party. Although we follow the logic of the argument, the Gaudins do not present us with any case, nor have we located any case, that has found a co-defendant who was nonsuited without prejudice to be a prevailing party because its former co-defendant subsequently obtained a take-nothing judgment on the merits.

Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   After erroneously signing an order granting the Severses' nonsuit and denying the Gaudins' counterclaim for attorney's fees, the trial court nevertheless considered the Gaudins' motion to vacate, the Severses' no-evidence motion for summary judgment, the Gaudins' response and Severses' reply, and held a September 25,\n   2015 hearing and sent a December 21, 2015 letter to the parties, all to specifically address the specific issue of attorney's fees. Then, the trial court conducted a February 19, 2016 status conference and signed an order on April 19, 2016, stating that after considering the pleadings, evidence, and arguments of counsel, it was denying all requests for attorney's fees. In its December 21, 2015 letter, the trial court explained that the Gaudins did not \"prevail\" because they \"did not 'win' any compensation other than the permission to continue construction on their home which was already in progress.\" Thus, the trial court stated that because the Gaudins did not prevail and \"considering the equities in this case,\" it declined to award attorney's fees to the Gaudins.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   Based on the foregoing, it is clear that the trial court did not act erroneously or without reference to guiding principles. First, we already held above that the Gaudins were not a \"prevailing party\" under the plain language of the CCRs. Second, we also noted that the record supported that the Gaudins failed to submit their building plans to Mira Vista before beginning construction. Finally, the trial court's actions holding multiple hearings, receiving evidence, and considering pleadings and arguments of counsel, coupled with the three-page letter ruling demonstrate that the trial court was deliberate in its analysis and ultimately in its decision to deny the Gaudins' request for attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   On this record, we conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the Gaudins' request for attorney's fees under section 37.009 of the civil practice and remedies code.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Anglo-Dutch Petroleum Int'l, Inc. v.

If we follow the Severses' argument correctly, in the event their breach-of-contract claim failed, their promissory estoppel and negligent misrepresentation claims would step in and fill the shoes of the dismissed breach-of-contract claim. However, this argument ignores the fact that their breach-of-contract claim could fail-not for lack of an enforceable contract-but because there simply was no breach. In that case, as in this case, the enforceable contract covering the same subject matter as the alleged misrepresentation and providing for the same measure of damages generally renders promissory estoppel and negligent misrepresentation claims unavailable. In the interest of thoroughness, however, we briefly address the merits of these claims.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"8\">\n   <p id=\"p-193\">\n    Nor did the Severses plead or prove an agency relationship between Mira Vista and the Gaudins.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"9\">\n   <p id=\"p-194\">\n    The American Rule is characterized as such in contrast with the \"English Rule.\"\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Alyeska Pipeline Serv.
