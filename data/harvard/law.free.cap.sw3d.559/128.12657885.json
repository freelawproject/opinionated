R. CIV. P. 192.3(a). This includes information that may ultimately be inadmissible at trial so long as it \"appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The \"subject matter\" of the underlying action, which involves the enforceability of a hospital lien securing payment of charges for services rendered to an uninsured patient, encompasses the reasonableness of those charges.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The trial court's order at issue in this mandamus proceeding requires the defendant hospital to produce information regarding its reimbursement rates from private insurers and public payers for the services it provided to the plaintiff. The hospital argues those reimbursement rates are irrelevant to whether its charges to the uninsured plaintiff were reasonable and that the trial court therefore abused its discretion in ordering production of that information. We disagree. The reimbursement rates sought, taken together, reflect the amounts the hospital is willing to accept from the vast majority of its patients as payment in full for such services. While not dispositive, such amounts are at least relevant to what constitutes a reasonable charge. Accordingly, we deny the hospital's petition for writ of mandamus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Crystal Roberts was involved in an automobile accident on June 9, 2015, and was taken by ambulance to the emergency room at North Cypress Medical Center. North Cypress released Roberts approximately three hours later after performing a series of x-rays, CT scans, lab tests, and other emergency services. Because Roberts was uninsured, North Cypress billed her for the services at its full \"chargemaster\" prices, which totaled $11,037.35. North Cypress also filed a hospital lien in the amount of the cost of its services, minus payments and adjustments credited to Roberts' account.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. PROP. CODE \u00a7 55.002(a) (\"A hospital has a lien on a cause of action or claim of an individual who receives hospital services for injuries caused by an accident that is attributed to the negligence of another person.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The liability insurer of the driver at fault offered to settle the case for $17,380, attributing $9,404 to medical expenses stemming from North Cypress's services. Roberts sought reduction of North Cypress's bill, and the parties negotiated but could not reach an agreement on the bill's amount.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Roberts sued, seeking a declaratory judgment that North Cypress's charges were unreasonable and its lien invalid to the extent it exceeds a reasonable and regular rate for services rendered.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   North Cypress counterclaimed on a sworn account for $8,278.31, the amount to which it had previously offered to reduce its bill.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Roberts served requests for production and interrogatories on North Cypress, including the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-20\">\n   \u2022 Please produce all contracts regarding negotiated or reduced rates for the hospital services provided to Plaintiff in which Defendant is a party, including those with Aetna, First Care, United Healthcare, Blue Cross Blue Shield, Medicare, and Medicaid.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-22\">\n   \u2022 Please produce the annual cost report you are required to provide to a Medicare Administrative Contractor Medicare [sic], as a Medicare certified institutional provider for 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2015.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-24\">\n   \u2022 Please state the Medicare reimbursement rate for x-rays, CT scans, lab tests and emergency room services, as you performed on the Plaintiff on June 9, 2015.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-25\">\n   \u2022 Please state the Medicaid reimbursement rate for x-rays, CT scans, lab tests and emergency room services, as you performed on the Plaintiff on June 9, 2015.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   North Cypress objected to these discovery requests and moved for a protective order, asserting that they sought irrelevant information and were overly broad. Roberts filed a corresponding motion to compel. In an oral ruling on the record, the trial court ordered North Cypress to produce the requested information, though the court narrowed the scope to include only contracts \"that cover the [time] period at issue in this case.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   North Cypress moved for reconsideration, reiterating its relevance objection and adding that it would \"suffer irreparable harm\" from the disclosure of its \"confidential and proprietary\" negotiated insurance contracts. The trial court denied the motion, prompting North Cypress to file a petition for writ of mandamus in the court of appeals. The court of appeals denied the petition, and North Cypress now seeks mandamus relief in this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Mandamus is an extraordinary remedy granted only when the relator shows that the trial court abused its discretion and that no adequate appellate remedy exists.\n   <em>\n    In re Prudential Ins. Co. of Am.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9146465\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/148/124/#p135\">\n    148 S.W.3d 124\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 135-36 (Tex. 2004). \"The trial court abuses its discretion by\n   ordering discovery that exceeds that permitted by the rules of procedure.\"\n   <em>\n    In re CSX Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9291577\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/124/149/#p152\">\n    124 S.W.3d 149\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 152 (Tex. 2003). We address North Cypress's two challenges to the discovery order in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    A. Relevance\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   North Cypress first argues that information about reimbursement rates from insurers and government payers is not relevant to Roberts' claims about the enforceability of its hospital lien.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. R. CIV. P. 192.3(a) (parties may obtain discovery of information that is \"relevant to the subject matter of the pending action\"). Evidence is \"relevant\" if \"it has any tendency to make a fact [of consequence to the action] more or less probable than it would be without the evidence.\" TEX. R. EVID. 401. And as noted, evidence need not be admissible to be discoverable so long as it \"appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.\" TEX. R. CIV. P. 192.3(a).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Because the subject matter of this action involves a dispute over a hospital lien, in evaluating the relevance of the requested information we must begin with a discussion of Texas's hospital-lien statute, codified in Texas Property Code chapter 55. This statute provides hospitals an additional method of securing payment from accident victims, encouraging their prompt and adequate treatment.\n   <em>\n    McAllen Hosps., L.P. v. State Farm Cty. Mut. Ins. Co. of Tex.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6939687\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/433/535/#p537\">\n    433 S.W.3d 535\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 537 (Tex. 2014). Subject to certain conditions, a hospital has a lien on the cause of action of a patient \"who receives hospital services for injuries caused by an accident that is attributed to the negligence of another person.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6939687\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/433/535/#p537\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting TEX. PROP. CODE \u00a7 55.002(a) ). The lien also attaches to the proceeds of a settlement of the patient's cause of action. TEX. PROP. CODE \u00a7 55.003(a)(3). We have noted that the statute \"is replete with language that the hospital recover the full amount of its lien, subject only to the right to question the reasonableness of the charges comprising the lien.\"\n   <em>\n    Bashara v.

North Cypress primarily argues that its negotiated reimbursement rates with health insurance carriers are not relevant to its charges to an uninsured patient and therefore are not discoverable. It urges that because Roberts had neither\n   private health insurance nor Medicare or Medicaid coverage when she was treated, she is not entitled to the benefit of those negotiated rates. North Cypress also cites our holding in\n   <em>\n    Haygood v. De Escabedo\n   </em>\n   that any billing adjustment reflected in the negotiated rates belongs to the insurance carrier, not the patient.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7316904\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/356/390/#p394\">\n    356 S.W.3d 390\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 394-95 (Tex. 2012). According to North Cypress, this further highlights the distinction between billed charges and reimbursement rates.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Roberts responds that the insurance contracts are necessary to establish whether the amount North Cypress charged Roberts for emergency services is excessive in comparison to the rates for the same services provided to other patients in the same hospital. Roberts avers that the contracts will show that North Cypress is customarily and regularly paid significantly less for those services, making the contracts relevant to the reasonableness of the charges.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Healthcare Pricing\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   This case highlights the \"two-tiered\" healthcare billing structure that has evolved over the past several decades. In\n   <em>\n    Haygood\n   </em>\n   , on which North Cypress heavily relies, we described these tiers as encompassing (1) \" 'list' or 'full' rates [also described as chargemaster rates] sometimes charged to uninsured patients, but frequently uncollected,\" and (2) \"reimbursement rates for patients covered by government and private insurance.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7316904\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/356/390/#p394\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7316904\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/356/390/#p394\">\n    at 393\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (footnotes omitted).

Evaluating Reasonableness of Hospital Charges\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Citing\n   <em>\n    Haygood\n   </em>\n   , North Cypress notes that its legal right to be paid for Roberts' treatment is not offset by a negotiated agreement with an insurance carrier.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Haygood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7316904\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/356/390/#p394\">\n    356 S.W.3d at 391\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that a plaintiff's recovery of medical expenses incurred is limited, as is the evidence at trial, \"to expenses that the provider has a legal right to be paid\"). The dissent similarly opines that hospitals should not be limited \"to charging an uninsured patient insurer-negotiated reimbursement rates.\"\n   <em>\n    Post\n   </em>\n   at 139. According to North Cypress and the dissent, this renders irrelevant any adjustments that would have been applicable if Roberts were covered by private health insurance, Medicare, or Medicaid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   However, the issue is not whether Roberts may take advantage of insurance she did not have. Rather, because a valid hospital lien may not secure charges that exceed a reasonable and regular rate, the central issue in a case challenging such a lien is what a reasonable and regular rate would be.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   And because of the way chargemaster pricing has evolved, the charges themselves are not dispositive of what is reasonable, irrespective of whether the patient being charged has insurance.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   By contrast, a hospital's reimbursements from private insurers and public payers comprise the vast majority of its payments for services rendered. We fail to see how the amounts a hospital accepts as payment from most of its patients are wholly irrelevant to the reasonableness of its charges to other patients for the same services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Courts in several other jurisdictions agree. In\n   <em>\n    Bowden v. Medical Center\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4240935\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/297/285/\">\n    297 Ga. 285\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4240935\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ga/297/285/\">\n    773 S.E.2d 692\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015), the Supreme Court of Georgia recently considered the exact issue presented here. That case also involved the validity and amount of a hospital lien for the reasonable charges for an uninsured's patient's care.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 693. The patient, Bowden, sought information and documents regarding amounts the hospital charged insured patients for the same type of care during the same time period.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The court held that such documents were discoverable, concluding:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote class=\"attorneys\" id=\"p-42\">\n   The amounts that TMC charged to (\n   <em>\n    and agreed to accept as payment in full from\n   </em>\n   ) other patients treated at the same hospital for the same type of care during the same general time frame that Bowden was treated may not be dispositive of whether TMC's charges for Bowden's care were \"reasonable\" under [Georgia's hospital lien statute], to the extent that the other patients were not similarly situated in other economically meaningful ways. But that does not mean that how much TMC charged those other patients is entirely irrelevant-particularly in the broad discovery sense-to the reasonableness of the charges for Bowden's care.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 696-97 (emphasis added). The court clarified that the hospital would be entitled to present evidence that the different amounts paid by insured patients \"reasonably reflected such economic factors as volume discounts or promises of prompt and full payment, or [were] based on the rates that the government was willing to pay.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 697. The court also noted that the evidence may or may not ultimately be admissible at trial, confirming that its holding was merely that the discovery sought had \"some relevance to the reasonableness of [the hospital's] charges for [Bowden's] care.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Other courts have held similarly. In\n   <em>\n    Parkview Hospital, Inc. v. Frost\n   </em>\n   , which involved the determination of reasonable charges to an uninsured patient under the Indiana Hospital Lien Act, the Indiana Court of Appeals held that the patient was entitled to discover information about discounted amounts the hospital accepted from patients who had private insurance or were covered by government programs.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6793965\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne3d/52/804/#p805\">\n    52 N.E.3d 804\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 805-06, 810 (Ind.

For example, in\n   <em>\n    Children's Hospital Central California v. Blue Cross of California\n   </em>\n   , the noncontracting insurer was required by statute to pay the hospital \"the reasonable and customary value\" of its services, which \"embodies the concept of quantum meruit.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6054732\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-app-4th/226/1260/\">\n    226 Cal.App.4th 1260\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=172%20Cal.%20Rptr.%203d%20861\">\n    172 Cal.Rptr.3d 861\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 872 (2014).

The \"fundamental\" variations affecting the connection between the information sought and the end for which it was sought in\n   <em>\n    National Lloyds\n   </em>\n   are not present here. Roberts seeks reimbursement rates only for the specific services she received.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, Roberts does not argue, and we do not hold, that the rates negotiated between North Cypress and any particular insurer govern the reasonableness of its charges to uninsured patients. Rather, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the amounts North Cypress is willing to accept as payment for services rendered to the vast majority of its patients is relevant to the reasonableness of its charges for those same services to uninsured patients.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Haygood\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7316904\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/356/390/#p394\">\n    356 S.W.3d at 393\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that few patients pay a hospital's full charges).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Finally, we note that North Cypress does not elaborate in its briefing on its relevance objection to the information contained in its Medicare cost reports. In any event, for discovery purposes a hospital's costs surely have some bearing on the reasonableness of its patient charges.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Colomar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5207245\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-2d/461/1265/#p1267\">\n    461 F.Supp.2d at 1272\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that a hospital's internal cost structure could play a role in evaluating a claim of unreasonable pricing).

Confidentiality\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In addition to its relevance objection, North Cypress argues the confidential nature of its insurance contracts warrants mandamus relief from the trial court's order requiring their production. North Cypress first raised this argument in its motion for rehearing in the trial\n   court. During the hearing at which the trial court denied the motion, North Cypress sought clarification on whether the court would \"be willing to put in place\" measures to protect its confidentiality concerns \"if ultimately our mandamus is unsuccessful.\" The court replied that, if the parties were unable to agree on such measures, North Cypress could \"file a motion for a confidentiality order\" for the court's consideration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Nothing in the record indicates that the trial court is unwilling to issue a protective order in the event North Cypress requests and demonstrates its entitlement to one.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX. R. CIV. P. 192.6. Nor does North Cypress explain why, in the event it is entitled to a protective order, such relief would be insufficient to address its concerns. Accordingly, we decline to grant mandamus relief on the ground that the contracts contain confidential and proprietary information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   <strong>\n    III. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The crux of Roberts' lien claim is whether the amount secured by North Cypress's hospital lien exceeds a reasonable and regular rate for the services provided. The amounts North Cypress accepts as payment for those services from other patients, including those covered by private insurance and government benefits, are relevant to whether the charges to Roberts were reasonable and are thus discoverable. We hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in compelling production of this information. Accordingly, we deny North Cypress's petition for writ of mandamus.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Chief Justice Hecht filed a dissenting opinion, in which Justice Green and Justice Guzman joined.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The Court holds that rates used by governmental programs like Medicare and Medicaid and by private insurers to reimburse a hospital for healthcare provided to covered patients-rates no patient ever pays out of her own pocket-are \"reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence\" of what a patient reasonably\n   <em>\n    should\n   </em>\n   pay for healthcare.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   How, exactly? Well, the Court says, there is \"at least the potential connection\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   between government-set and insurer-negotiated reimbursement rates and reasonable charges to a self-pay patient. Of course, the Court explains, \"many considerations go into negotiated rates\",\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   so \"reimbursement rates standing alone are [not] dispositive of the question of what constitutes a reasonable and regular rate for a hospital's services\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and \"are not necessarily a perfect comparator in evaluating the reasonableness of a provider's charges.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Agreed. So, then, what is the \"potential connection\" between reimbursement rates and reasonable charges to self-payers? Here, with dizzying circularity, is the Court's only answer: \"It defies logic to conclude that ... payments [by the government and insurers] have nothing to do with the reasonableness of charges to the small number of patients who pay directly.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Actually, it is the Court's analysis that defies logic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The Court cannot distinguish this case from our decision last Term in\n   <em>\n    In re National Lloyds Insurance Co.\n   </em>\n   that one party's attorney fees in a case are generally irrelevant in determining whether an opposing party's attorney fees are reasonable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nor does the Court address our concern in that case, raised here as well, that any marginal relevance the requested discovery might have in a particular case is outweighed by the real risks of abuse and confusion of the jury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Seven years ago in\n   <em>\n    Haygood v. De Escabedo\n   </em>\n   , the Court observed that \"it has become increasingly difficult to determine what [healthcare] expenses are reasonable.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   While an individual healthcare provider, like any service provider, must take into account its costs, profit margins, and market-including its experience, expertise, and location-in setting its charges, governmental regulation and private insurance have driven charges for healthcare into a now-familiar, two-tiered structure.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The higher tier consists of the \"full\" or \"list\" prices set out in a detailed \"chargemaster\" for each service, similar to the \"sticker price\" of a new car.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   The lower tier includes the reimbursement rates set by governmental insurers like Medicare and Medicaid or negotiated with private insurers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Governmental insurers provide one- to two-thirds of most American hospitals' income, and their reimbursement rates, usually based on patient diagnoses, may not even cover a procedure's cost.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   The amount a private insurer is willing to pay to a hospital for a particular service-and the amount that a hospital is willing to accept-reflects a number of factors including the volume of patients that the insurer has previously or potentially could direct to that hospital and the insurer's promise of prompt payment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Because reimbursement rates are often percentages of or influenced by list prices, providers are incentivized to set list prices as high as possible.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   List prices are usually multiple times reimbursement rates.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Each patient is charged the list price.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   If the patient is insured, the price is reduced to the set or negotiated reimbursement\n   rates.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   If the patient is not insured, a provider may choose to reduce charges based on the patient's means, and in some instances, provide care free of charge for charity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   But it is not required to do so.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Healthcare providers generally contend, as does North Cypress, that list prices and reimbursement rates are both reasonable charges\n   <em>\n    under the circumstances\n   </em>\n   -that is, depending on whether the patient is or is not insured. There is no demonstrated relationship between reimbursement rates and prices regularly charged to uninsured patients.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   It is unreasonable to limit a hospital to charging an uninsured patient insurer-negotiated reimbursement rates. The patient cannot confer on the hospital benefits of a predictable volume of business or ease of payment as an insurer can. As we explained in\n   <em>\n    Haygood\n   </em>\n   , the benefit of an insurer's discounted rate belongs to the insurer, not the insured.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   It certainly does not belong to an uninsured patient. Nor can reimbursement rates, which vary from insurer to insurer, be used to determine reasonable charges for uninsured patients. The Court cannot suggest a formula for doing so. And because governmental reimbursement rates are often below a hospital's costs, they can provide no basis for gauging the reasonableness of charges to uninsured patients. In sum, none of the information at issue that North Cypress has been ordered to produce in discovery can be used to determine whether its charges to Roberts were reasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Rather, a reasonable charge to Roberts would be what North Cypress, and perhaps other similarly situated hospitals, regularly charge uninsured patients. The record indicates that North Cypress based its charges to Roberts on its list prices, reduced by exactly 25%. Roberts does not argue, and there is nothing to indicate, that North Cypress ever gave a different discount to another patient in Roberts' position or that it discriminated against her in any way. Nor does Roberts argue, or anything suggest, that North Cypress based its charges to Roberts or other self-payers on reimbursement rates. To the contrary, the evidence is undisputed that\n   North Cypress charged Roberts 25% of its list prices. Thus, contrary to the Court's \"logic\", nothing in North Cypress' reimbursement rates can show that the charges to Roberts were either reasonable or unreasonable. The reimbursement rates are purely irrelevant. Suppose North Cypress' list price for a procedure were $200, Medicare would reimburse $25, and 3 private insurers would reimburse $90, $100, and $110, respectively. Would a $150 charge to all uninsured patients be reasonable or unreasonable? There is simply no way to tell. Roberts has not shown that lower reimbursement rates for insured patients can lead to admissible evidence of reasonable charges for uninsured patients. That evidence is of the usual and customary prices regularly charged uninsured patients.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   We have recently granted mandamus relief from orders requiring discovery of irrelevant information in comparable situations. The Court cannot distinguish those cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Just last Term, in\n   <em>\n    In re National Lloyds Insurance Co.\n   </em>\n   , insured homeowners suing their insurer for underpaying property-damage claims sought discovery of the insurer's attorney fees to show the reasonableness of their own attorney fees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   The trial court ordered production.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   We held that one party's attorney fees are generally irrelevant in determining the reasonableness of an opposing party's attorney fees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   What a lawyer of particular experience and position would charge a client to advance its position in litigation is ordinarily irrelevant in determining what another lawyer would charge a different client to advance the opposing position.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   In a similar case identically styled, another homeowner, also suing her insurer for underpaying her property-damage claim, sought discovery of the insurer's claim files for other homes in the same town damaged by the same storm.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   The homeowner argued that the other claim files could be used to \"establish[ ] a baseline\" to compare the adjustment of her claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"[W]e fail[ed] to see how [the insurer's] overpayment, underpayment, or proper payment of the claims of unrelated third parties [was] probative of\" whether the plaintiff's claim had been undervalued.\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   We noted \"the many variables\" that would affect evaluation of a claim, \"such as when the claim was filed, the condition of the property at the time of filing (including the presence of any preexisting damage), and the type and extent of damage inflicted by the covered event.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    28\n   </footnotemark>\n   And we characterized the plaintiff's proposed strategy of \"[s]couring claim files in hopes of finding similarly situated claimants whose claims were evaluated differently\" as \"an 'impermissible fishing expedition.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    29\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Evidence of how other property-damage claims were valued does not generally lead to admissible evidence that another claim was undervalued. Evidence of what one party paid its lawyer to take one position in a case does not generally lead to admissible evidence that the attorney fees an opposing party paid her lawyer to take a different position were reasonable. By the same token, evidence of healthcare reimbursement rates set by the government or negotiated by private insurers does not lead to admissible evidence that prices charged a self-paying patient, without reference to reimbursement rates, were unreasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    III\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   In last Term's\n   <em>\n    National Lloyds\n   </em>\n   opinion, the Court added that \"[e]ven if a party's attorney-billing information were marginally relevant to an opposing party's fee claim, discovery of such information should ordinarily be denied because the 'probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of ... unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, misleading the jury, undue delay, or needlessly presenting cumulative evidence.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court must limit discovery when its burden outweighs its likely benefit.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   North Cypress billed Roberts $11,037.75. The insurer of the man responsible for the auto accident offered to settle Roberts' claim against him for $17,380, of which $9,404 was for past medical expenses. Roberts asked North Cypress to reduce its bill to $3,500, based on her counsel's estimation of \"the reasonable and necessary charges ... for the treatment received based on the geographic area and similarly sized facilities.\" North Cypress agreed to a 25% reduction, to $8,278.31. Roberts asked for a further reduction to $6,269.33, two-thirds of the amount offered by the tortfeasor's insurer. When North Cypress refused to lower its bill by another $2,000, Roberts sued for actual and punitive damages under statutes governing deceptive trade practices, debt collection, and fraudulent liens.\n   <footnotemark>\n    32\n   </footnotemark>\n   The discovery ordered by the trial court has brought the parties to this Court in a dispute over $2,000-$5,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   North Cypress contends that the information Roberts seeks is proprietary and confidential and should be subject to a protective order. That will add to the expense of the case. Further, amici raise the concern that hospitals, faced with this kind of litigation and concerned that the confidentiality of their negotiations with insurers cannot be protected, will simply cave in to demands of uninsured patients and attempt to shift the costs of their treatment to insured patients or suffer the loss of income. If the confidential information were directly relevant to Roberts' claim, the concerns the amici raise might be unavoidable. But when neither Roberts nor the Court can state how reimbursement\n   rates can be used to show that charges to self-payers are unreasonable, the discovery should not more be allowed than in the\n   <em>\n    National Lloyds\n   </em>\n   cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   * * * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Cost and delay are the prevalent criticisms of the American civil justice system, and the main contributor to both is discovery.\n   <footnotemark>\n    33\n   </footnotemark>\n   \" 'Discovery is often the most significant cost of litigation' and a potential 'weapon capable of imposing large and unjustifiable costs on one's adversary.' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    34\n   </footnotemark>\n   Discovery is an essential tool in our system for ascertaining the truth in civil cases.
