Hawkins asserts that the motion court clearly erred in denying his motion for post-conviction relief because he received ineffective assistance of counsel in that his trial counsel failed to object to the admission of a witness's entire videotaped statement to police. Finding no error, we affirm. Rule 84.16(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
