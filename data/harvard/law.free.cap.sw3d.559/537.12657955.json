WOODFIN JONES, Chief Justice.\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   We withdraw the opinion and judgment issued herein on January 7, 2011 and issue the following opinion in place of the earlier one.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Appellant David Fernea sued appellee Merrill Lynch Pierce Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc. (\"Merrill Lynch\") asserting various causes of action arising from its alleged failure to adequately supervise its employee, Terry Christopher Bounds, in the sale of a portion of his outside businesses to Fernea. Merrill Lynch moved for summary judgment, attaching affidavits to its motion as evidence. Fernea objected to the affidavits on several grounds. The trial court overruled Fernea's objections and granted summary judgment in favor of Merrill Lynch. In eleven issues, Fernea asserts that the trial court erred in overruling his objections to Merrill Lynch's summary-judgment affidavits and in granting summary judgment for Merrill Lynch on each of his claims. We will affirm in part and reverse and remand in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Bounds is an employee of Merrill Lynch and a licensed securities broker. Bounds also owned two \"outside\" direct-marketing corporations that were unrelated to his employment at Merrill Lynch. Bounds decided to sell his interests in those companies and, according to Fernea, solicited Fernea to \"purchase shares\" in the businesses. After negotiation, Fernea agreed to buy a fifty-percent interest in each company. Fernea alleged that, \"[a]fter receiving payment, Bounds refused to perform\n   his side of the agreement, concealing his actions by delivering a fake stock certificate for 1000 shares of 'Bounds &amp; Pinto, Inc.,' an illegal, non-existent corporation with a deceptively similar name [to the companies' actual names].\" Fernea asserted that Bounds made numerous misrepresentations and omissions to induce Fernea to purchase the stock. The alleged omissions included Bounds's failure to disclose that the stock being sold was not and had never been registered with the Texas State Securities Board and that Bounds's companies had been the subject of consumer-protection litigation by the Texas Attorney General. Fernea also contended that Bounds \"secretly and repeatedly attempted to resell to others the same corporations previously sold to Fernea.\" Although Fernea and Bounds had become acquainted socially, and Fernea was not a customer of Merrill Lynch, Fernea asserted that the \"relationship between Merrill Lynch and Bounds was important\" to him in deciding to invest in Bounds's companies because he \"thought that [affiliation] ... would weigh heavily [against] any possible deception on [Bounds's] part.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The parties dispute the extent of Merrill Lynch's awareness of Bounds's sale to Fernea. Merrill Lynch admitted that it knew of the attorney general's consumer-protection litigation and had, as a result, undertaken an investigation of Bounds's outside companies, specifically inquiring into whether Bounds had met his disclosure responsibilities to Merrill Lynch. Referencing Merrill Lynch's internal documents and testimony by Bounds, Fernea alleges that \"[a]s a part of its investigation, Merrill Lynch was notified that Bounds intended to sell a portion of his interest in the corporations.\" In particular, Fernea points to a \"Letter of Education\" addressed to Bounds from his superiors at Merrill Lynch that reprimanded him for failing to accurately report his outside companies' lines of business. The letter noted that, as a \"mitigating factor\" in Merrill Lynch's decision not to take sterner disciplinary action, Bounds had decided to \"sell [his] outside business to devote more time and effort to growing [his] business at the Firm.\" Fernea asserts that this document is evidence that \"Merrill Lynch knew the corporations were both Sub-C corporations and knew that Bounds's holdings in the corporations were evidenced by stock.\" Fernea also alleges that \"[a]lthough Merrill Lynch knew that Bounds was trying to sell his interest in the corporations-interests held in stock-Merrill Lynch made no attempt to inquire about the sale, its terms, or the registration of the securities.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Fernea filed suit against Bounds, Bounds's companies, and Merrill Lynch, seeking damages and rescission of the transaction. Fernea alleged five causes of action against Merrill Lynch: (1) violation of section 33 of the Texas Securities Act, the \"aider and abettor\" liability provision; (2) violations of several internal rules of the New York Stock Exchange (\"NYSE\") and the National Association of Securities Dealers (\"NASD\"); (3) negligence for violating Merrill Lynch's internal policies with respect to outside transactions conducted by its employees; (4) negligent supervision of Bounds with respect to his outside transactions; and (5) \"control person\" liability under the Texas Securities Act.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Merrill Lynch moved for summary judgment, asserting that (1) Fernea could provide\n   no evidence on several of the elements of aider-and-abettor liability; (2) there is no private right of action for a violation of NYSE and NASD rules or internal company policies, or, in the alternative, the evidence conclusively proved that no violations occurred; (3) Merrill Lynch had no duty to Fernea with respect to a violation of its internal policies, or, in the alternative, the evidence conclusively proved that no violation occurred; (4) Fernea failed to state a claim for negligent training and supervision because Merrill Lynch did not owe him a duty and the evidence conclusively disproved proximate cause; and (5) Merrill Lynch was not liable under the Texas Securities Act because, as a matter of law, it was not a \"control person\" as that term is defined in the statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Fernea objected to portions of the affidavits attached to Merrill Lynch's motion. After a hearing, the trial court overruled Fernea's objections and granted summary judgment in favor of Merrill Lynch on all of Fernea's claims. The court then severed Fernea's claims against Merrill Lynch from those against the other defendants, making the summary judgment final and appealable as to Merrill Lynch. Fernea perfected this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Whether summary judgment is proper is a question of law that we review de novo.\n   <em>\n    FM Props.

Although the parties briefed this appeal as if Merrill Lynch had properly sought both traditional and no-evidence summary judgment on each of Fernea's claims, a review of the motion shows that Merrill Lynch asserted a proper no-evidence motion only as to Fernea's aider-and-abettor claim under the Texas Securities Act. Although Merrill Lynch's motion also stated that \"[t]here has been adequate time for discovery, and there is no evidence of one or more essential elements of the Plaintiff's causes of action against Merrill Lynch,\" such a statement does not, by itself, meet the requirements of a no-evidence motion for summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex.R.

To hold a defendant liable for negligence under a voluntary-undertaking theory, the plaintiff must establish that (1) the defendant voluntarily undertook to perform services that it knew or should have known were necessary for the plaintiff's protection, (2) the defendant failed to exercise reasonable care in performing those services, and either (3) the plaintiff relied upon the defendant's performance or (4) the defendant's performance increased the plaintiff's risk of harm.\n   <em>\n    Torrington Co.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11093840\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/46/829/#p837\">\n    46 S.W.3d at 838-39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Fernea asserts that the voluntary undertaking in question was Merrill Lynch's adoption of internal procedures regarding employee-owned outside interests.

As to risk of harm, we conclude that Merrill Lynch's adopting a set of internal operating policies and procedures did not, without more, increase the risk of harm to Fernea. Although the contours of the voluntary-undertaking doctrine are not clearly defined, voluntarily undertaking to render services requires, at a minimum, that an actor take some active step directed toward a third person-something more than merely enacting general guidelines.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11093840\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/46/829/#p837\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11093840\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/46/829/#p837\">\n    at 839\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (manufacturer of helicopter rotor bearings undertook voluntary efforts to investigate helicopter accident and allegedly provided negligently incomplete information about scope of problem to customers);\n   <em>\n    Colonial Sav.

Here, there is no nexus between Merrill Lynch's voluntary undertaking-i.e., the adoption of its policies-and its alleged negligence. That is, Fernea does not allege that Merrill Lynch negligently\n   <em>\n    adopted\n   </em>\n   its policies. Rather, he asserts that Merrill Lynch was negligent in later failing to\n   <em>\n    follow\n   </em>\n   them.

Thus, to recover here, Fernea needed to allege that Merrill Lynch was negligent in adopting its policies, not in later failing to carry them out.

Merrill Lynch argues that Fernea's negligent-supervision claim fails because (1) Merrill Lynch did not owe Fernea a duty; (2) there was no connection between the damages Fernea suffered and Bounds's employment with Merrill Lynch; (3) Fernea cannot establish the element of proximate causation; and (4) the evidence shows that Merrill Lynch properly supervised Bounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   As discussed above, a cause of action for negligence arises when an actor breaches a legal duty and the breach proximately causes damages.\n   <em>\n    Hogue,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8162311\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/271/238/#p246\">\n    271 S.W.3d at 246\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The plain language of that rule does not impose a duty on Merrill Lynch; rather, it imposes a duty on\n   <em>\n    Bounds\n   </em>\n   to disclose his outside interests to the firm. As such, it does not, by itself, support a negligence claim against Merrill Lynch.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Rule 3040 prohibits any person-e.g., Bounds-\"associated with [an NASD] member\"-e.g., Merrill Lynch-from participating in a private securities transaction \"except in accordance with the requirements of this Rule.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"594941\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/418/1376/#p1383\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   R. 3040(a).

Because the securities in a private transaction are sold \"away\" from the member firm-i.e., not as part of the member's business-these sales are often called \"selling away\" transactions and are disfavored because of a heightened potential for fraud. Thus, rule 3040 prohibits selling away unless such a transaction is conducted \"in accordance with the requirements of this Rule.\" The rule requires that if, as here, a security is sold for compensation, the associated person is required to give written notice to the member \"describing in detail the proposed transaction and the person's proposed role therein and stating whether [the associated person] has received or may receive selling compensation in connection with this transaction.\" After receiving notice, the member must either approve or disapprove of the outside transaction in writing.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"594941\" index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/418/1376/#p1383\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   R. 3040(b)-(c).

As evidence, it presented affidavit and deposition testimony from Bounds and Charlotte Logann, Merrill Lynch's Austin-area Business Administrative Manager, who also served as the local compliance officer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   As Fernea correctly notes, both Logann and Bounds are interested witnesses because they are Merrill Lynch employees. Nonetheless, rule 166a states that \"[a] summary judgment may be based\n   on the uncontroverted testimonial evidence of an interested witness ... if the evidence is clear, positive and direct, otherwise credible and free from contradictions and inconsistencies, and could have been readily controverted.\" Tex.R. Civ. P. 166a(c). Fernea asserts that the affidavit testimony of Bounds and Logann fails to conclusively prove lack of notice because (1) the testimony has been controverted by Merrill Lynch's documentary evidence and by the witnesses' own testimony; (2) the testimony is \"not clear, positive, and direct, or free of contradictions\"; and (3) the underlying issue of fact-whether notice was given-cannot be readily controverted because Merrill Lynch \"has sole possession of its documentation, and has objected to discovery related to this issue on the basis of attorney/client privilege.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   We agree with Fernea that Bounds's affidavit testimony cannot be used to support summary judgment for Merrill Lynch. Fernea's testimony regarding Bounds's allegedly fraudulent conduct casts doubt on Bounds's general credibility as a witness. Thus, we conclude that his testimony is not the \"otherwise credible\" evidence of an interested witness that is required to support summary judgment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex.R. Civ. P. 166a(c).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Logann's testimony, however, is a different matter. Logann, on behalf of Merrill Lynch, averred that the company never received notice of the transaction between Bounds and Fernea. She stated that, in late 2005, Bounds \"informed Merrill Lynch verbally that he had decided to sell his outside businesses.\" She testified by affidavit that Bounds \"occasionally mentioned to [her] that he was still in the process of selling his business, or that he thought he might have a good prospect for the sale. He never revealed any more detailed information than that.\" Logann also stated that \"Bounds never gave Merrill Lynch written notice of any kind regarding the sale [to Fernea],\" and that \"Bounds never gave Merrill Lynch written notice that he intended to engage in any activity that might constitute a private securities transaction under NASD Conduct Rule 3040.\" Logann stated that, before the lawsuit, she had no knowledge that Bounds had actually consummated a sale, sold only a portion of his businesses, sold them to Fernea, or prepared a stock certificate in connection with that transaction. Logann's deposition testimony as to these facts is substantially similar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <em>\n    (i) Fernea's Objections to Logann's Affidavit\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Before we address Fernea's assertions that Logann's testimony is contradicted by other evidence, we must consider his seventh through tenth issues in which he asserts that the trial court erred in overruling his objections to Bounds's and Logann's summary-judgment affidavits. Because we have already determined that Bounds's testimony is insufficient to stand as conclusive interested-witness summary-judgment evidence, we will limit our discussion to Logann's affidavit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   We review the trial court's evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    Horizon/CMS Healthcare Corp. v.

As to paragraphs 14 and 18,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   however, Logann admitted having limited personal knowledge. In light of such an admission, it was arguably an abuse of discretion to overrule Fernea's objections to those two paragraphs. Any error, however, was harmless because removing paragraphs 14 and 18 does not affect the strength of Logann's testimony that Merrill Lynch never received written notice from Bounds giving details of his sale of securities to Fernea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Fernea also objected to various portions of Logann's affidavit as conclusory or unsupported by documentary evidence. He also objected to the court's allowing Logann to amend her affidavit to correct an improperly made authentication of its exhibits. We need not address these objections because Fernea does not object (other than for lack of personal knowledge) to the portions of Logann's testimony that would affect her testimony regarding a lack of notice. Thus, assuming without deciding that the court erred and should have struck the offending paragraphs, any\n   such error would have been harmless for the same reason discussed above.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <em>\n    (ii) Logann's Affidavit\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Substantively, Fernea asserts that Logann's statements concerning Merrill Lynch's lack of notice under rule 3040 are inconsistent with her later testimony and various documents showing that she knew Bounds was preparing to sell his outside businesses and that he held his business in stock. We disagree. Merrill Lynch does not dispute that it knew, at some point in late 2005, that Bounds was planning to sell his businesses. Such knowledge, however, is not inconsistent with Logann's testimony that Merrill Lynch never received detailed written notice about Bounds's eventual sale of securities to Fernea.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Fernea asserts that Bounds's affidavit testimony contradicts Logann's and creates a fact question as to whether Bounds gave Merrill Lynch the required written notice. Fernea relies on the following statements from Bounds's affidavit: \"At no time did any of this transaction involve Merrill Lynch or anything to do with my employment at Merrill Lynch. The anticipated listing and sale of my outside interests\n   <em>\n    was disclosed by me to Merrill Lynch as required.\n   </em>\n   \" (Emphasis added.) Fernea asserts that, because we must construe all reasonable inferences in his favor, we must assume that when Bounds said he disclosed his \"anticipated listing and sale ... as required\" what he really meant was that he gave Merrill Lynch the detailed written notice of an impending selling-away transaction required by rule 3040 to impose on Merrill Lynch a duty to supervise the transaction. Considering the vagueness of the statement itself and the context in which it appears, however, we conclude that it gives rise to no more than a suspicion or surmise that Bounds gave Merrill Lynch detailed written notice of his securities sale to Fernea.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ford Motor Co.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9241232\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/135/598/#p601\">\n    135 S.W.3d at 601\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (suspicion or surmise of existence of fact is no more than scintilla of evidence). Viewed in context, this is particularly clear. Bounds's affidavit states that he did not know he was selling a security, and that \"the stock certificate was never considered by Mr. Fernea or me to represent an official or registered security.\" He then discusses that his outside companies did not benefit from the sale and that Merrill Lynch had nothing to do with the sale. It would not be a reasonable inference to read Bounds's statement that he disclosed the \"anticipated listing and sale\" of his outside businesses to mean that, despite the fact that he was unaware that he was selling securities, he gave Merrill Lynch detailed notice that he was selling securities to Fernea, especially as the parties agree that Bounds gave Merrill Lynch notice in late 2005 that he anticipated selling his outside companies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Finally, Fernea asserts that he is unable to present contradictory documentary evidence because Merrill Lynch withheld such evidence under the guise of attorney-client privilege. But Fernea did not move to compel production of the documents in question despite sufficient opportunity to do so. Without availing himself of the mechanisms at his disposal to acquire the evidence he sought, he cannot now assert that its absence is grounds for reversal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   <em>\n    (iii) Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   We hold that Merrill Lynch conclusively established that it did not receive the detailed written notice required by rule 3040 to trigger its duty to supervise Bounds's outside business sale under NASD rules. Consequently, it has conclusively negated the duty element of Fernea's claim for negligent supervision. Having conclusively negated an element of Fernea's claim,\n   Merrill Lynch was entitled to summary judgment on that claim. We overrule Fernea's sixth issue. Also, because any error in the trial court's overruling of Fernea's objections to Merrill Lynch's affidavits was harmless, we overrule his seventh through tenth issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Aider-and-Abettor Liability\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   In his fourth issue, Fernea asserts that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment on his claim that Merrill Lynch violated section 2 of article 33(F) of the Texas Securities Act, which imposes joint and several liability on aiders and abettors in fraudulent securities transactions. That section states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   A person who directly or indirectly with intent to deceive or defraud or with reckless disregard for the truth or the law materially aids a seller, buyer, or issuer of a security is liable under Section 33A, 33B, or 33C jointly and severally with the seller, buyer, or issuer, and to the same extent as if he were the seller, buyer, or issuer.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Tex.Rev.Civ.

Merrill Lynch asserts that it had no awareness of Bounds's sale of those securities to Fernea or that such securities were unregistered. Fernea asserts that \"Merrill Lynch had 'general awareness' of the transaction [because it] knew that Bounds had engaged in a sale of securities, as evidenced by the testimony of [two Merrill Lynch representatives], and by the letter of education.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   In addition to the letter of education, which we discussed in more detail in the facts section above, Fernea cites the following testimony from Logann and Kent Varner, the Director of Merrill Lynch's Austin \"Capitol Complex\" where Bounds worked. Logann testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   Q. Do you know how in [the letter of education] this sentence was added, \"Additionally, management has also considered your decision to sell your outside business to devote more time and effort to growing your business at the firm?\" How did that end up in the letter?

And, more importantly, it does not give rise to more than a mere suspicion that Merrill Lynch had \"a general awareness of its role in the\n   <em>\n    violation\n   </em>\n   \"-i.e., the actual sale of unregistered securities to Fernea.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Frank,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11474950\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/11/380/#p384\">\n    11 S.W.3d at 384\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Logann testified that she discovered at some point that Bounds \"sold a piece [of his companies], not half, but just a portion\" of them. Far from giving rise to a reasonable inference that Merrill Lynch had a general awareness about the violation\n   <em>\n    before\n   </em>\n   it happened, her testimony is consistent with a conclusion that Merrill Lynch did not become aware of the violation itself until after it had taken place. Likewise, Varner's testimony and the letter of education, which Varner approved and signed, merely support a conclusion that, at some point prior to Bounds's sale to Fernea, Merrill Lynch had knowledge that Bounds was attempting to sell his companies. That testimony would not allow a reasonable fact finder to conclude that Merrill Lynch had awareness about the nature of the specific transaction at issue here, much less that the sale was conducted illegally.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   We conclude that Fernea presented no more than a scintilla of evidence as to the general-awareness element of the aider-and-abettor test. Therefore, the trial court did not err in granting summary judgment in favor of Merrill Lynch on this claim.

Rather, it asserts that it was not a controlling person vis-\u00e0-vis Bounds because it did not have the power to control or influence the\n   <em>\n    specific transaction or activity\n   </em>\n   that gave rise to the underlying violation. Merrill Lynch acknowledges that it had day-to-day control over Bounds in matters concerning his employment, but it asserts that because the violation in question concerned Bounds's outside businesses, it cannot be considered to have had the power to control Bounds in a transaction involving those entities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   Fernea argues that \"Merrill Lynch had control of all aspects of Mr. Bounds's business relevant in this case.\" He asserts that Merrill Lynch had the power to \"approve and monitor and prohibit Mr. Bounds's sale to Mr. Fernea\" and to prohibit the transaction altogether. As evidence of its control, Fernea cites Merrill Lynch's responses to his requests for admission and the deposition testimony of Ms. Logann. In her deposition, Ms. Logann testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   Q. Okay. Can you tell me what happens when-assuming [NASD Rule] 3040 applies, what happens when Merrill Lynch approves the transaction.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n   A.

And then if they receive-if Merrill Lynch approved it, then it would go on the records of Merrill Lynch.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-126\">\n   Q. Okay. And they would supervise and monitor the transaction?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-127\">\n   A. Yes. They would be required to.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-128\">\n   Q.

And what would happen if Merrill Lynch disapproved the transaction?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-131\">\n   A. Then the transaction should not take place.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-132\">\n   Q. In any form or fashion?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-133\">\n   A. In any form or fashion.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   Fernea presented evidence that Merrill Lynch was aware of both Bounds's ownership of the companies at issue and of his intent to sell them. Moreover, although the transactions at issue were not performed through Bounds's association with Merrill Lynch, Fernea also asserted that the business connection between Bounds and Merrill Lynch factored into his investment decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   In addition to the foregoing, Fernea relies on the scope of Bound's specific employment relationship with Merrill Lynch. For example, Fernea's request for admission 18 stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-136\">\n   <strong>\n    REQUEST:\n   </strong>\n   [Admit] that you authorized Bounds' [sic] ownership of the Companies.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-137\">\n   <strong>\n    RESPONSE:\n   </strong>\n   Admitted. Although NASD Conduct Rule 3030 does not require that the firm \"authorize\" outside interests, Merrill Lynch imposes such a requirement. Merrill Lynch admits that it authorized Mr. Bounds's role as a director and officer of PBC Marketing Co., Bounds &amp; Pinto Marketing, and Austrends Co., and employment by Bounds &amp; Pinto Marketing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   Merrill Lynch's private-client branch office policy manual prohibited employees from \"engaging in any private securities transaction without full disclosure to and prior written approval from the corporation.\" Logann testified that the practical effect of this policy was that, as a condition of Bounds's employment, he was prohibited from engaging in a private securities sale unless he obtained written permission from Merrill Lynch.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Tex.Rev.Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 581-33(F) cmt. (power to control or influence can arise by contract);\n   <em>\n    Frank,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11474950\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/11/380/#p384\">\n    11 S.W.3d at 384\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (same). Thus, as a condition of his employment, Bounds agreed not to enter into any outside securities transactions without Merrill Lynch's permission. Such power to control is not dependent on any notice, but rather arises from the employment bargain that Bounds struck with Merrill Lynch. In light of this bargain, we cannot say that Merrill Lynch has conclusively proved that it did not have the power to control or influence the specific transaction at issue here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   Nonetheless, Merrill Lynch contends that its lack of knowledge of and participation in the sale to Fernea prevented it from having control over the specific transaction. We have held above that Merrill Lynch conclusively proved it did not receive written notice of the securities sale to Fernea as required by NASD rule 3040. As previously discussed, such lack of notice means that Merrill Lynch did not have a duty imposed by the rule to approve or deny the transaction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   NASD Rule 3040. Merrill Lynch appears to equate this duty with the power to control or influence the specific transaction. We do not think, however, that a\n   <em>\n    duty\n   </em>\n   to control Bounds's outside securities transaction is synonymous with the\n   <em>\n    power\n   </em>\n   to \"control or influence\" that transaction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barnes,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9365651\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/97/759/#p763\">\n    97 S.W.3d at 763\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Logically, conclusive proof of the absence of a duty to control does not constitute conclusive proof of the absence of the power to control or influence.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Black's Law Dictionary 580, 1288 (9th ed. 2009) (defining duty as \"a legal obligation that is owed or due to another and that needs to be satisfied; an obligation for which somebody else has a corresponding right\"; defining power as \"the ability to act or not act; esp., a person's capacity for acting in such a manner as to control someone else's responses\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Accordingly, Merrill Lynch's lack of knowledge of and participation in the sale to Fernea does not constitute conclusive proof that it lacked the power to control or influence the specific transaction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Even if the plaintiff establishes that a defendant qualifies as a control person, the defendant will not be liable if\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-142\">\n   the control person did not know and, in the exercise of reasonable care could not have known of the facts on which the liability is based, e.g. the untruth or omission of material information, or the fact that the securities were not registered and should have been.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   Tex.Rev.Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 581-33(F) cmt.;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Barnes,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9365651\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/97/759/#p763\">\n    97 S.W.3d at 763-64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Such a showing is an affirmative defense for which the defendant bears the burden of proof. Tex.Rev.Civ. Stat. Ann. Art. 581-33(F)(1) ;\n   <em>\n    Barnes,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9365651\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/97/759/#p763\">\n    97 S.W.3d at 764\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   Even assuming that a lack of notice could serve as proof relevant to the affirmative defense by showing that Merrill Lynch did not know of the transactions at issue, lack of notice would not, by itself, establish the second prong of the defense, which requires proof that \"in the exercise of reasonable care [the controlling person] could not have known[ ] of the existence of the facts by reason of which the liability is alleged to exist.\" Tex.Rev.Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 581-33(F)(1). Merrill Lynch has not attempted to prove that the second prong of the affirmative defense was met.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   In light of the foregoing, we conclude that the evidence presented left a fact question regarding whether Merrill Lynch had the power to control or influence the investment transactions at issue and that Merrill Lynch did not conclusively establish both elements of the relevant affirmative defense. Accordingly, the district court erred by granting summary judgment in favor of Merrill Lynch on this claim.

SWS Financial Services\n    </em>\n    controls the outcome of this case. Although the facts in\n    <em>\n     Barnes\n    </em>\n    are similar in some respects to those in the present case, there are critical differences. In that case, Brooks, a registered agent for a broker-dealer, operated an outside business specializing in selling church-related securities.\n    <em>\n     Barnes,\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9365651\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/97/759/#p763\">\n     97 S.W.3d at 761\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Instead of investing the money he received from the securities sales, Brooks spent the money on personal expenses.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9365651\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/97/759/#p763\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Brooks's investors sued his brokerage firm, asserting that it was liable to them as a control person. The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the firm, holding that the evidence conclusively established that the firm lacked the power to control the transactions at issue.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-163\">\n    <em>\n     Barnes\n    </em>\n    differs from the present case in several respects. First, and most importantly here, Merrill Lynch's policies conditioned Bounds's employment on the power to control outside transactions such as the one at issue here. There was no evidence of such an agreement in\n    <em>\n     Barnes.\n    </em>\n    Second, the defendant in\n    <em>\n     Barnes\n    </em>\n    moved for both no-evidence and traditional summary judgment. Here, Merrill Lynch filed only a traditional motion as to this claim. The\n    <em>\n     Barnes\n    </em>\n    court focused largely on the\n    <em>\n     lack\n    </em>\n    of evidence establishing control, not solely on the evidence affirmatively demonstrating lack of control, as we must do.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9365651\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/97/759/#p763\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9365651\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/97/759/#p763\">\n     at 765\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Third, the court in\n    <em>\n     Barnes\n    </em>\n    made no mention of evidence indicating that the brokerage firm was aware of the problematic transactions. To the contrary, the analysis indicates that the brokerage firm had no knowledge of the transactions because they were not \"reported to\" the firm.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9365651\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/97/759/#p763\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Finally, unlike the case here, the summary judgment evidence in Barnes \"established many of the appellants were unfamiliar with [the firm] and did not rely on [the firm] in deciding to\" make the investments at issue.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9365651\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/97/759/#p763\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
