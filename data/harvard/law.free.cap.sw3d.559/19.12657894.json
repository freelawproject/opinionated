(\"Father\") appeals from the trial court's judgment ordering Father to pay to the guardian ad litem (\"GAL\") the sum of $5,500 \"for his reasonable GAL fees\" from the GAL's appointment to a Motion to Modify the Paternity Judgment action that was voluntarily dismissed without prejudice. We reverse and remand.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   A Judgment Pursuant to Uniform Parentage Act was entered on August 24, 2012, regarding one minor child between Father and J.M.Z. (\"Mother\"). Approximately four years later, on May 4, 2016, Father filed a Motion to Modify Paternity Judgment. During the pendency of the Motion to Modify Paternity Judgment, on July 18, 2016, GAL was appointed for the minor child involved in the case. First, Mother was ordered to pay $200 and Father was ordered to pay $500 for costs and fees for GAL. On September 6, 2016, Mother was ordered to pay $1,000 and Father was ordered to pay $2,000 to GAL \"as a deposit toward GAL fees on or before November 1, 2016.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On February 24, 2017, Father filed a Memorandum of Voluntary Dismissal of his motion, which was entered on February 28, 2017, and dismissed the pending matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On April 6, 2017, GAL filed his motion for remaining fees. Father filed a Motion in Opposition to GAL's request for fees based on a lack of jurisdiction of the court to grant judgment on behalf of GAL. That motion was heard on April 27, 2017, and a stipulation was entered by the parties on May 18, 2017. The parties stipulated that the sum of $5,550 in GAL fees remained\n   unpaid, inclusive of $2,000 previously ordered to be paid by Father on September 6, 2016; and GAL fees were incurred prior to the filing of Father's voluntary dismissal of this matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On June 14, 2017, the court granted GAL's request for fees and ordered Father to pay the sum of $5,500\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   , which represented the $3,500 in outstanding fees due to GAL in addition to $2,000 in fees already awarded to GAL prior to the dismissal of the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On June 29, 2017, Father filed a Motion for Rehearing, requesting that the matter be reheard by a judge of the family court. On July 14, 2017, the family court judge entered a Judgment and Order, denying GAL's Motion for Fees. However, on July 21, 2017, GAL filed a Motion for Rehearing and/or Motion to Set Hearing Date. After the parties appeared through counsel with GAL and argument was heard, the trial court entered a Judgment on August 21, 2017, which ordered Father to pay to GAL the sum of $5,500 for his reasonable GAL fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Father filed his timely notice of appeal on September 29, 2017. This appeal follows.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Father raises two points on appeal. First, he alleges the trial court erred in entering a judgment affirming an award of GAL fees against Father because it was a misapplication of Missouri law and interpretation of the Missouri statute in that the award was pursuant to a motion for GAL fees filed 41 days after the voluntary dismissal of the underlying cause of action and was not for payment of statutorily authorized costs/fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Second, Father alleges the trial court erred in entering a judgment affirming an award of GAL fees against Father because it was a misapplication of Missouri law in that the GAL did not file his motion for fees until 41 days after the voluntary dismissal of the underlying cause of action, thus, even if the court retained jurisdiction as to an award of GAL fees as costs post-voluntary dismissal, the court lost jurisdiction over its judgment thirty days after the entry of the judgment/dismissal as no timely post-trial motion was filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <em>\n    A.
