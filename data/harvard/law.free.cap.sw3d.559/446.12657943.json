Bell then retained different counsel who filed an untimely amended motion. Before either motion was ruled, our Supreme Court handed down\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Gittemeier v. State\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12385560\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/527/64/\">\n    527 S.W.3d 64\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mo. banc 2017), which declined to extend the abandonment doctrine to excuse an untimely amended motion by retained counsel. Following\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Gittemeier\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , the motion court declined to conduct an abandonment inquiry, found the claims in Bell's\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   motion were not cognizable, and denied relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Bell's sole point on appeal charges that the motion court abused its discretion and was fundamentally unfair in following\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Gittemeier\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Bell acknowledges cases like\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Thornton v. Denney\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6852400\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/467/292/#p298\">\n    467 S.W.3d 292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 298-99 (Mo. banc 2015), that support the motion court's action. However, he claims that our supreme court in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     State v. Bazell\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12182019\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/497/263/\">\n    497 S.W.3d 263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mo. banc 2016), and later decisions has applied a new statutory interpretation \"going forward only in some cases\" and taking into account whether a party should or should not receive the benefit or harm of a change in the law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We disagree. Our supreme court's choice not to apply\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Bazell\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   retroactively to final criminal cases where sentence has been executed and no appeal pends,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <strong>\n     State ex rel. Windeknecht v. Mesmer\n    </strong>\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12386985\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/530/500/#p503\">\n    530 S.W.3d 500\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 503 (Mo. banc 2017), does not contradict the general principle that appellate statutory or rule interpretation applies to and governs cases then pending in trial courts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Gittemeier\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   came down months before the motion court decided this case. Bell cites nothing in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Bazell\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   or elsewhere that authorizes trial judges to disregard controlling case law on issues then pending before them. Judgment affirmed.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
