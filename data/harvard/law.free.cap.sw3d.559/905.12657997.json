Mr. Braddy argues he received ineffective assistance of counsel at his commitment trial because his counsel discussed the pretrial SVP screening process during opening statements and elicited testimony on the subject from expert witnesses. He also argues the circuit court erred in failing to exclude evidence of a prior murder arrest. He further claims the circuit court erred in failing to strike for cause a juror who was one of several venirepersons who raised their hands when the venire panel was asked generally whether any of them agreed with another juror who later was disqualified for cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This Court affirms the judgment.

FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   James Braddy was found guilty of one count of first-degree statutory rape under\n   section 566.032, RSMo Supp. 2006.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The circuit court found him to be a persistent sexual offender under section 558.018, RSMo Supp. 2006,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and sentenced him to seven years in prison. He successfully completed the Missouri Sex Offender Program, and the department of probation and parole recommended him for early release.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   When, as in Mr. Braddy's case, an incarcerated person has been convicted of a sexually violent offense, section 632.483, RSMo Supp. 2014, requires, \"Within three hundred sixty days prior to the anticipated release from a correctional center,\" the incarcerated person must undergo a screening process to determine whether he or she meets the definition of an SVP under Missouri law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The screening process for Mr. Braddy began when Dr. Nena Kircher performed an end-of-confinement evaluation prior to Mr. Braddy's release and determined he met the definition of an SVP. The department of corrections then referred Mr. Braddy to a multidisciplinary team and a prosecutor's review committee, which also separately concluded he met the SVP criteria.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The State subsequently filed a petition in the Iron County circuit court pursuant to section 632.486, RSMo Supp. 2001, requesting Mr. Braddy remain in custody \"for evaluation as to whether he is a sexually violent predator; and for a trial on the issues.\" The circuit court held a hearing pursuant to section 632.489.2, RSMo Supp. 2009; found there was probable cause Mr. Braddy was an SVP; and ordered the department of mental health to perform an additional mental examination. Dr. Rick Scott performed the evaluation and diagnosed Mr. Braddy with antisocial personality disorder and pedophilia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A jury trial was then held to determine whether Mr. Braddy was an SVP. At trial, the State attempted to introduce a state-prepared timeline summary of Mr. Braddy's conviction history. Mr. Braddy objected and renewed his pretrial motion in limine concerning prior bad acts, which the circuit court had taken under advisement. He argued the timeline contained unduly prejudicial information about a prior conviction because the timeline notes he originally had been charged with \"murder/hindering\" but ultimately was convicted only of hindering prosecution of the actual murderer. The court overruled the objection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Dr. Kircher, the end-of-confinement screener, testified at trial she diagnosed Mr. Braddy with antisocial personality disorder, a mental abnormality predisposing him to commit acts of sexual violence. Dr. Kircher further testified she believed Mr. Braddy met the SVP criteria - a threshold only 3 to 5 percent of the individuals she evaluates meet. The State also called its own expert, Dr. Kimberly Weitl, a psychologist who interviewed Mr. Braddy and reviewed his records prior to trial. Dr. Weitl testified she diagnosed Mr. Braddy with\n   pedophilic disorder, antisocial personality disorder, and narcissistic personality disorder, and indicated she believed he met the SVP criteria.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   By contrast, Dr. Scott, who conducted the court-ordered mental examination, was called by Mr. Braddy's counsel. He testified he diagnosed Mr. Braddy with antisocial personality disorder and pedophilia but also testified favorably to Mr. Braddy that he could not say he met the SVP criteria.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The jury unanimously found Mr. Braddy to be an SVP and, on June 9, 2016, the circuit court committed Mr. Braddy to the department of mental health. Mr. Braddy filed a motion for new trial 36 days after the judgment. The circuit court overruled the motion, and this Court granted transfer.\n   <em>\n    Mo. Const. art.

MR. BRADDY FAILED TO SHOW HE RECEIVED INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL DURING HIS COMMITMENT PROCEEDING\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Mr. Braddy alleges his trial counsel was ineffective when she discussed various steps of the pretrial SVP screening process during opening statements and through examination and cross-examination of various expert witnesses at trial. He says this brought otherwise inadmissible and unfairly prejudicial information before the jury. The State argues Mr. Braddy had no right to effective assistance of counsel and, therefore, this claim is without merit. It also argues the evidence was not unduly prejudicial and was part of reasonable trial strategy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    In the Matter of the Care and Treatment of Nicholas Grado\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ,\n   </em>\n   decided today, this Court recognized a due process right to effective assistance of counsel in SVP commitment proceedings. Mr. Braddy, therefore, was entitled to effective assistance of counsel during his SVP commitment proceeding. Mr. Braddy relies on two cases from other jurisdictions to support his ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Neither of these cases involved a claim of ineffective assistance of respondent's counsel. Rather, both involved misuse of evidence of this pretrial process to try to bolster the State's case that respondent was an SVP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    In re Care &amp; Treatment of Foster,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3252431\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/280/845/\">\n     280 Kan. 845\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3252431\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan/280/845/\">\n     127 P.3d 277\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2006)\n   </em>\n   , during opening statements, the prosecutor told the jury the respondent's case had already been \"reviewed by a ...

The evidence was not admitted as part of an attempt to prejudice the jury into believing Mr. Braddy must be an SVP but as part of the defense effort. As in\n   <em>\n    Grado\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ,\n   </em>\n   so too here, under either the\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   standard applied to SVP proceedings in other states, or under the \"meaningful hearing based on the record\" standard applied in Missouri termination of parental rights cases such as\n   <em>\n    In Interest of J.P.B.\n   </em>\n   , Mr. Braddy's counsel was not ineffective. Indeed, Mr. Braddy does not claim he did not receive a meaningful hearing.

What you're going to hear from her is that the amount of review that she did was no more than about three hundred pages at the most. In a case where the pages easily reach a thousand, maybe two thousand. ... You're also going to hear that the point of her evaluation is not to come into the court and tell you whether or not he qualifies to be committed. You're going to hear from her own report that the limitation of her evaluation is to determine if [Mr. Braddy] should be screened out. That's what you're going to hear, [the doctor] coming in and saying, \"Well, my job was to screen him and pass him along, not come to court, not testify in the trial, not even conduct a full evaluation of all the documents.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Counsel did not discuss additional details of the screening evaluation results during opening statements. Counsel also attempted to show the limited relevance of the prescreening process to the court proceeding during her cross-examination of Dr. Weitl after Dr. Weitl testified on direct that she used to work at the department of corrections as a pretrial screener for potential SVPs.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   As part of an effort to discredit Dr. Kircher's end-of-confinement report Mr. Braddy's counsel also mentioned the screening process in cross-examination in an attempt to show the jury Dr. Kircher did not utilize all presently available information in making the report and did not conduct the evaluation for the purpose of testifying at trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   While the usefulness of undertaking cross-examination regarding these pretrial issues, in retrospect, seems minimal, counsel had limited options available. She knew Dr. Scott would testify Mr. Braddy did not qualify as an SVP, and counsel needed to somehow discredit the prosecution's experts, who found he did. In these circumstances, the Court cannot say the strategy, at the time, to demonstrate the limitations and superficiality of the pretrial process was so flawed as to be unreasonable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Similarly, this Court cannot say counsel was ineffective in asking Dr. Scott about the process as part of counsel's effort to show the State's experts based\n   their opinions on incomplete information, whereas Dr. Scott had complete information when he reached his \"opinion, to a reasonable degree of certainty, [Mr. Braddy is]\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   more likely than not to commit another sexually violent act if not confined.\" (Emphasis added.).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mr. Braddy has failed to show his counsel's conduct was ineffective.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     IV.

The briefs and record do not show the exhibit was admitted into evidence, and it has not been filed with this Court. Without the exhibit before it, this Court cannot evaluate Mr. Braddy's claim the timeline as prepared unduly emphasized\n   the initial charge rather than Mr. Braddy's actual conviction of hindering prosecution. \"If original exhibits are necessary to the determination of any point relied on, they shall be deposited in the appellate court by the appellant.\"\n   <em>\n    Rule 81.16(a).\n   </em>\n   \"When an exhibit is not filed with the appellate court, the intendment and content of the exhibit will be taken as favorable to the trial court's ruling and as unfavorable to appellant.\"\n   <em>\n    Fessler v.

Later, however, the State amended the charge to hindering prosecution based on evidence showing, while Mr. Braddy did not commit the murder, he went with \"his buddy\" to look for the victim and the buddy then murdered the victim. Because Mr. Braddy failed to report the murder, he ultimately pleaded guilty to hindering prosecution for the murder. Dr. Scott relied on this prior conviction merely as a prior sentencing he considered in determining Mr. Braddy's likelihood to reoffend. The fact the prior sentencing was for hindering prosecution of a murder in particular did not appear to be of import.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Dr. Weitl, however, testified she relied on the timeline as a summary of Mr. Braddy's criminal history in evaluating him for a mental abnormality, stating she was \"really looking at everything from the time he was born until the present time\" and \"especially want[ed] to know about the relationships, how he interacted with other people, his sexual development, obviously, criminal history.\" She acknowledged even one's nonsexual criminal history is generally important because it allows her to \"see that someone is not following social norms\" and, in Mr. Braddy's case, showed he \"wasn't following the ... conditions of probation, which is important.\" The nature of the hindering prosecution conviction, therefore, would have been relevant to her consideration of his prior criminal history and was part of the basis on which she ultimately diagnosed Mr. Braddy with several mental abnormalities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Mr. Braddy nonetheless claims the evidence was unfairly prejudicial because it had the effect of \"painting him as a bad or evil man.\" But the evidence clearly was admissible under section 490.065, which provides, \"An expert may base an opinion on facts or data in the case that the expert has been made aware ... If experts in the particular field would reasonably rely on those kinds of facts or data in forming an opinion on the subject, they need not be admissible for the opinion to be admitted.\" Dr. Weitl stated she relies on an individual's criminal history in determining\n   whether they meet the SVP criteria. Further, Mr. Braddy's counsel was able to bring out in her examination of Dr. Scott that Mr. Braddy was not convicted of actually having committed the murder himself. \"Generally, a trial court has considerable discretion in admitting or excluding evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    St. Louis Cty. v.

Mr. Braddy's counsel followed up with Juror 19 as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    [Mr. Braddy's Counsel]\n   </em>\n   : You just answered the question.

Anybody else in my - twenty-three, fifteen. Do I have everybody here? Fourteen. Moving over here twenty-seven, twenty-nine, thirty-two, thirty-six, forty-one, fifty-nine, fifty and fifty-five. I can't see your numbers. I'm doing this from memory, and forty-nine.\" (Emphasis added.). Jurors 49 and 62 subsequently interrupted Mr. Braddy's counsel's questioning, unprompted, to make some statements to clarify their responses (or lack thereof) to the above question. The following are discussions between Mr. Braddy's counsel and Jurors 49 and 62:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   <em>\n    [Juror 49]\n   </em>\n   : Ma'am, I will promise to keep a clear head and hear everything before I tender my decision, but I will not sit here and lie to you either -\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   <em>\n    [Mr. Braddy's Counsel]\n   </em>\n   : Excellent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   <em>\n    [Juror 49]\n   </em>\n   : - because I've got to live with me.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-70\">\n   <em>\n    [Mr. Braddy's Counsel]\n   </em>\n   : Absolutely.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   <em>\n    [Juror 49]\n   </em>\n   : And it is what I'm sensing is what I'm going on.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   <em>\n    [Mr. Braddy's Counsel]\n   </em>\n   : What you're sensing?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   <em>\n    [Juror 49]\n   </em>\n   : (Nodded head.) It's all that makes sense. What I'm sensing is what I'm doing. It's all I have to go by. I can't judge like the rest of you. I have to go with what I'm feeling.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-74\">\n   <em>\n    [Mr. Braddy's Counsel]\n   </em>\n   : Can you follow the Court's guidance?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   <em>\n    [Juror 49]\n   </em>\n   : Yes, I can.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   <em>\n    [Mr. Braddy's Counsel]\n   </em>\n   : And would it be fair to say that what you're sensing,\n   how you feel, how you decide is maybe common sense for you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   <em>\n    [Juror 49]\n   </em>\n   : What I am sensing is what I have to sense every day in order to exist, because I am no longer given benefits that you are giving, your senses, which makes other senses more keen.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-78\">\n   <em>\n    [Mr. Braddy's Counsel]\n   </em>\n   : Okay.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-79\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-80\">\n   <em>\n    [Juror 62]\n   </em>\n   : Your question is I don't know if I agree with what [Juror 19] said. I don't know if I agree or not.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-81\">\n   <em>\n    [Mr. Braddy's Counsel]\n   </em>\n   : Okay. Number 62, let me go back through it for you. I asked the question if [Juror 19] could consider releasing my client knowing that he has been convicted of victimizing children, and she said - I'm going to try to make sure I get this right - that he should be committed or in jail, one or the other, but not released. She couldn't consider that as an option in this case, even though the Judge would instruct her. Do you agree with that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-82\">\n   <em>\n    [Juror 62]\n   </em>\n   : No.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-83\">\n   <em>\n    [Mr. Braddy's Counsel]\n   </em>\n   : No?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-84\">\n   <em>\n    [Juror 62]\n   </em>\n   : I can listen to the case and then make my decision. Right now I don't have a decision on what should happen.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-85\">\n   <em>\n    [Mr. Braddy's Counsel]\n   </em>\n   : That's exactly what I asked. Does everybody understand that, everybody agree with that, that at this point there are no decisions that can be made? Even though we have some feelings, some of you are there, and that's okay. But under the law, the Judge will tell you to reserve your judgment, and I know you're getting tired of hearing me say that. I've said it like eight hundred times. Okay?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Counsel did not otherwise follow up as to what Juror 4 or other venirepersons meant by raising their hands. Nonetheless, at the close of voir dire, Mr. Braddy's counsel moved to strike Juror 4 for cause on the ground he was one of those who raised a hand when counsel asked the venire, \"who here agrees with Number 19?\" The State opposed the strike, stating \"if that's going to be the only reason for these strikes going on here on out, I'm not willing to consent to anything that's based just on a hand raise. If there's something else, they verbalized or articulated some other reason in addition to that, I'm open to discussing it, but just a hand raise is not a commitment.\" The circuit court overruled Mr. Braddy's counsel's motion to strike Juror 4.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Mr. Braddy now claims the circuit court erred in failing to strike Juror 4 for cause because his hand raise meant he also was not qualified to serve as a juror. Because Mr. Braddy failed to timely file a motion for new trial, this issue is reviewed only for plain error causing manifest injustice.\n   <em>\n    Rule 30.20; Rule 78.07(a).\n   </em>\n   This Court concludes the circuit court's decision to seat Juror 4 did not result in a manifest injustice as he was not shown to be unqualified under either section 494.470.1 or section 494.470.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The State argues a hand raise by a venireperson in response to a question from counsel should be given no meaning as it is just as likely to mean the person has a question or wants a break as it is to be a response to the question asked. This Court rejects that argument. It is common practice to ask venirepersons to raise their hands if they agree or disagree with a particular statement. Such practices would have little purpose if the jurors' responses\n   had no meaning. Indeed, the record shows the State repeatedly asked questions to the venire panel indicating a hand raise would be an appropriate response, such as, \"So if you recognize one of these names, can I get you to raise your hands?\" and, \"Does anybody feel that is something they need to raise their hand on?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   This Court also rejects Mr. Braddy's counsel's argument that a mere hand raise in response to the question asking whether other venirepersons agreed with Juror 19 was sufficient, in itself, to require the court to disqualify Juror 4 for cause unless the court itself established through additional questioning that Juror 4 had been rehabilitated. Counsel cites no authority a judge is obligated to ask follow-up questions for every venireperson who raises a hand, when counsel has chosen not to do so, and this Court declines to so hold.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   This case provides a good example of why counsel's proposal that a hand raise requires disqualification would be unworkable. Counsel had just asked Juror 19 a series of complex questions and received a variety of answers, some of which were disqualifying, and others of which merely discussed Juror 19's views but were not in themselves disqualifying. Because there is no basis to determine which of Juror 19's statements Juror 4 was indicating agreement with, the hand raise by itself does not show Juror 4 had \"formed or expressed an opinion concerning the matter or any material fact in controversy\" or could not \"follow the court's instructions.\"\n   <em>\n    \u00a7 494.470\n   </em>\n   . Indeed, when Mr. Braddy's counsel did later follow up with one of the other venirepersons, that venireperson was able to explain, while he had some of Juror 19's concerns, he could follow the court's instructions. Counsel simply chose not to similarly follow up with Juror 4 as to what he meant by raising his hand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Moreover, a \"venireperson's qualifications as a prospective juror are not determined by an answer to a single question, but by the entire examination.\"\n   <em>\n    Joy, 254 S.W.3d at 890\n   </em>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Joy\n   </em>\n   , a prospective juror made statements during voir dire that expressed a \" 'strong bias' against 'lawsuits in general.' \"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   But when subsequently asked if he could be \"fair and unbiased\" the juror responded that he could.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Of particular relevance here,\n   <em>\n    Joy\n   </em>\n   noted \"there were numerous questions posed to the entire venire to which [the venireperson] did not feel compelled to respond\" concerning whether they could each follow the court's instructions and keep an open mind until they had heard the evidence at trial.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   From considering these facts, this Court held, \"although [the juror] gave some answers during voir dire that raised the possibility that he was prejudiced, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the tenor of his testimony overall was that he would be fair and impartial.\"\n   <em>\n    Id. at 891\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   As in\n   <em>\n    Joy\n   </em>\n   , counsel for both parties asked numerous questions of the entire venire panel aimed at determining whether the potential jurors would have trouble keeping an open mind, hearing all the evidence before coming to any conclusions concerning Mr. Braddy, and following the court's instructions. As in\n   <em>\n    Joy,\n   </em>\n   Juror 4 did not raise a hand or otherwise respond affirmatively to any of those questions, which included:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-94\">\n   [State]: Does anybody think that sounds unfair, that if you're going to serve on a case, you've got to keep an open mind until everybody has had a chance to get their case out in front of you?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-96\">\n   [State]: [W]ould anybody have a problem following this directive that you're not to make up your mind about the case until all the evidence and the closing arguments have come before you? Would anybody have a problem waiting until all the evidence came in, everybody had a chance to argue to you, and then you make up your mind?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   [State]: Even if the subject material is distasteful and you're not going to like it, would everybody agree that they could follow the Court's instruction and wait until all the evidence is in and wait until everybody has had a chance to make their case?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-99\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-100\">\n   [State]: Does anybody feel who hasn't already said so they could not give the Respondent, Mr. Braddy, a fair shake and a chance to be heard?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   [State]: [H]as anybody else kind of taken the position that they already kind of decided how the case should turn out even though they haven't heard anything, and it happens?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   [State]: And can anybody think of any reason they haven't already stated that they could not give everybody a chance to be heard, that they could not wait until all the evidence comes in and all the closing arguments are made before they make up their mind how the case should end?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   [Mr. Braddy's Counsel]: Is there anybody who thinks, you know what, once I hear the word pedophilia, I cannot consider committing him or letting him go? I can't follow the Judge's instructions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   [Mr. Braddy's Counsel]: Is there anybody who agrees ... [that] leopards don't change their spots? ... Is there anybody who can't consider the notion that people change? In a case like this, is there anybody who says, you know what, especially in a case like this, people don't change?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   As in\n   <em>\n    Joy\n   </em>\n   , the fact Juror 4 did not feel compelled to respond affirmatively to any of these questions is appropriate for the court to consider in determining whether Juror 4 is qualified under section 494.470.2. Jurors will be disqualified under section 494.470.2, however, only if their beliefs \"preclude them from following the law as declared by the court in its instructions.\"\n   <em>\n    \u00a7 494.470.2.\n   </em>\n   When looking at the totality of Juror 4's voir dire examination, it is reasonable to find \"the tenor of his testimony overall was that he would be fair and impartial.\"\n   <em>\n    Joy, 254 S.W.3d at 891\n   </em>\n   .

Draper III, Judge\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   I concur with the principal opinion's holding James Braddy (hereinafter, \"Braddy\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   has a constitutional right to effective assistance of counsel in proceedings to commit him pursuant to the Sexually Violent Predator Act (hereinafter, \"the Act\"). I further concur with the principal opinion's holding Braddy did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel. However, the principal opinion did not reach or resolve the issue concerning which standard should apply when a civilly committed sexually violent predator (hereinafter, \"SVP\") raises ineffective assistance of counsel claims. Hence, I write separately because I believe this case of first impression, along with its companion case,\n   <em>\n    In re the Matter of the Care and Treatment of Nicholas Grado\n   </em>\n   , No. SC96830,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12657996\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/559/888/\">\n    559 S.W.3d 888\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204572722\">\n    2018 WL 4572722\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mo. banc 2018), present this Court with the opportunity to declare the appropriate standard. After reviewing a wealth of persuasive legal authority from other jurisdictions implementing the same standard under the same circumstances, had the principal opinion addressed the matter, I believe it would be clear these claims should be reviewed under the standard set forth in\n   <em>\n    Strickland v. Washington,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    466 U.S. 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    80 L.Ed.2d 674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   In this case, the state argued, if this Court determined an ineffective assistance of counsel claim raised by an SVP was cognizable, the appropriate standard should be whether the attorney was effective in providing the client with a meaningful hearing based on the record. This is the same standard of review that applies in termination of parental rights cases.\n   <em>\n    In Interest of J.P.B.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12370955\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/509/84/#p97\">\n    509 S.W.3d 84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 97 (Mo. banc 2017). However, the state cannot cite any legal authority-from Missouri or other jurisdictions-applying such a minimal standard to SVP proceedings. In contrast, Braddy cites widespread support in other jurisdictions to apply\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   to involuntary commitments generally and specifically to SVP proceedings, which result in a form of involuntary commitment.

An SVP's right to counsel arises from a constitutional right to due process, similar to-albeit\n   distinct from-the Sixth Amendment right to counsel, and the right exists because it is the SVP's liberty that is affected, similar to a criminal commitment. The right to counsel arises from the Fourteenth Amendment and protects the individual from an unlawful infringement on liberty, similar to a criminal commitment. Given the similarities between SVP proceedings and criminal commitment, it is not only reasonable, but also prudent, to look to criminal standards for guidance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Hence, I would find the\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   standard should be applied when civilly committed SVPs raise ineffective assistance of counsel claims.
