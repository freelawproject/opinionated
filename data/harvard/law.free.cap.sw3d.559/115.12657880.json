Brown raises three points on appeal claiming ineffective assistance of trial counsel. In his\n   first two points, Brown argues trial counsel was ineffective for failing to call witnesses to testify regarding an alternate perpetrator and impeachment evidence. In his third point, Brown asserts trial counsel was ineffective for not objecting to and improperly highlighting testimony mentioning Brown's name in a gang profile. We hold that Brown did not overcome the strong presumption that trial counsel's strategy was reasonable under\n   <em>\n    Strickland v.
