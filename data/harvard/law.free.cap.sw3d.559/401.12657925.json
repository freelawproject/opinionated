We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Bazell\n   </em>\n   , our Supreme Court held that Section 570.030 did not permit the class A misdemeanor offense of stealing to be enhanced to a felony because, by its own terms, the felony enhancement provision in Section 570.030.3 applied only to those offenses \"in which the value of property or services is an element,\" and \"stealing,\" as defined by Section 570.030.1\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   , contained no such element.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12182019\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/497/263/\">\n    497 S.W.3d at 266-67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

On appeal, however, Movant argues that\n   <em>\n    Windeknecht\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable here because that case considered\n   <em>\n    Bazell\n   </em>\n   's applicability in the context of habeas relief, not a post-conviction challenge. Thus, Movant claims that he should be permitted to raise his claim in a Rule 24.035 motion because his sentence \"exceeds the maximum penalty authorized by law.\" Movant's argument, however, \"erroneously conflates procedural cognizability with substantive merit.\"\n   <em>\n    Watson v.

Movant's argument, however, critically misinterprets the effect of\n   <em>\n    Windeknecht\n   </em>\n   's holding. In\n   <em>\n    Windeknecht\n   </em>\n   , the Missouri Supreme Court explicitly stated that:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   [t]he Supreme Court of the United States has held a state supreme court is not constitutionally compelled to make retroactive a\n   <em>\n    different interpretation of a state statute.\n   </em>\n   'A state in defining the limits of adherence to precedent may make a choice for itself between the principle of forward operation and that of relation backward.'\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    Windeknecht\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12386985\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/530/500/\">\n    530 S.W.3d at 503\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Wainwright v.

In that vein, our Supreme Court exercised its authority to only apply\n   <em>\n    Bazell\n   </em>\n   's holding, which established a different interpretation of Section 570.030, prospectively except for cases pending on direct appeal.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11714888\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/414/21/#p23\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11714888\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/414/21/#p23\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   In doing so, it made clear that the sentences like those received by the petitioners in\n   <em>\n    Windeknecht\n   </em>\n   ; the movants in\n   <em>\n    Abrams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Watson\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Bosworth\n   </em>\n   ; and Movant were \"authorized by a different interpretation of [S]ection 570.030 without objection [such that the parties] should not receive the benefit of retroactive application of [the Supreme] Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Bazell\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11714888\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/414/21/#p23\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11714888\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/414/21/#p23\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Watson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12656378\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/545/909/#p915\">\n    545 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   916 ;\n   <em>\n    Abrams\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12656897\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/550/557/#p558\">\n    550 S.W.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   558 ;\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bosworth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12657950\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/559/5/#p8\">\n    559 S.W.3d at 10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%203977035\">\n    2018 WL 3977035\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *4.
