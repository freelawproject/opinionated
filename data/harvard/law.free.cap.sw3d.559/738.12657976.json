Child Protective Services became involved with the family in October 2016 due to concerns regarding Dora's drug use\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and instability of the home. Oliver was incarcerated\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   at the time. The children were placed with their maternal grandmother, but she subsequently informed the Texas Department of Family and Protective Services that she could no longer care for the children because she and her fianc\u00e9 were moving to Virginia. The Department removed the children and filed a petition in January 2017 seeking to terminate Dora's parental rights. The petition also requested that the trial court determine whether Oliver is the father of the children and to terminate his parental\n   rights if, after being served with citation, he has not responded by timely filing an admission of paternity or a counterclaim for paternity under Chapter 160 or he has not registered with the paternity registry under Chapter 160, Texas Family Code. The trial court found that the Department had proven the termination ground alleged in the petition by clear and convincing evidence, and that termination of Oliver's parental rights was in the children's best interest. The trial court appointed the Department as the permanent managing conservator of the children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    ALLEGED BIOLOGICAL FATHER\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Oliver raises two issues challenging the termination of his parental rights under Section 161.002.

This statute provides that the rights of an alleged biological father may be summarily terminated if after being served with citation, he does not respond by timely filing an admission of paternity or a counterclaim for paternity under Chapter 160 of the Texas Family Code. TEX.FAM.CODE ANN. \u00a7 161.002(b)(1) (West Supp. 2017). By filing an admission or counterclaim for paternity, the alleged father is given the right to require the petitioner to prove by clear and convincing evidence one of the predicate termination grounds set forth in Section 161.001(1) and that termination is in the best interest of the child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <em>\n    Phillips v. Texas Department of Protective &amp; Regulatory Services\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11239656\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/25/348/#p357\">\n    25 S.W.3d 348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 357 (Tex.App.-Austin 2000, no pet.).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The trial court found by clear and convincing evidence that Oliver, after being served with citation, did not respond by timely filing an admission of paternity or by filing a counterclaim for paternity or for voluntary paternity to be adjudicated under Chapter 160 of the Texas Family Code before the final hearing in the case. The Department introduced into evidence a return of citation showing that Oliver was served with the termination petition and a certificate of paternity registry search establishing that he did not register his intent to claim paternity with respect to any of the three children.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX.FAM.CODE ANN. \u00a7 161.109. The record also shows that Oliver did not file an admission of paternity or a counterclaim for paternity under Chapter 160.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Despite the foregoing evidence showing that he did not respond in the manner required by Section 161.002(b)(1), Oliver argues that the record demonstrates that he nevertheless claimed paternity of the children in writing and this is sufficient to prevent summary termination of his parental rights. More specifically, Oliver points to his handwritten note made in the section of the family service plan designated for the parent's comments. It reads:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   I will follow through this plan only because I love my kids so much that I'm willing to take full custody of them. The blemish is on the mothers behave [sic]. I have nothing to do with what she was doing. If the mother doesn't comply, I will. I already seen she has failed one's [sic]. With the documents I got in the mail from C.P.S. Plus I do fear for my kids [sic] life being around people like that. I care for them a lot. So I prefer my kids to be with me as soon as I get a chance to take them with me. Thanks.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Oliver placed his signature at the bottom of the note. The service plan, including Oliver's handwritten note, was filed with the trial court clerk on March 30, 2017, and it was introduced into evidence at trial. Oliver cites\n   <em>\n    Toliver v.

TEX.FAM.CODE ANN. \u00a7 160.201(b)(2). Section 160.301 provides that the mother of a child and a man claiming to be the biological father of the child may sign an acknowledgment of paternity with the intent to establish paternity. TEX.FAM.CODE ANN. \u00a7 160.301. Section 161.302 establishes the formal requirements for a voluntary \"acknowledgement of paternity.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX.FAM.CODE ANN. \u00a7 160.302 (West 2014). It requires that an acknowledgement of paternity (1) be in a record; (2) be signed or otherwise authenticated, under penalty of perjury by the mother and the man seeking to establish paternity; (3) state that the child whose paternity is being acknowledged: (A) does not have a presumed father or has a presumed father whose name is stated; and (B) does not have another acknowledged or adjudicated father; (4) state whether there has been genetic testing and, if so, that the acknowledging man's claim of paternity is consistent with the results of the testing; and (5) state that the signatories understand that the acknowledgment is the equivalent of a judicial adjudication of paternity of the child and that a challenge to the acknowledgment is permitted only under limited circumstances.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX.FAM.CODE ANN. \u00a7 160.302 (West Supp. 2017).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Section 161.002(b)(1) requires only an \"admission of paternity\" and does not require that an alleged biological father file a formal acknowledgment of paternity in accordance with Section 160.302.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Estes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10016782\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/773/800/#p802\">\n    773 S.W.2d at 801-02\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (drawing a distinction between a formal \"statement of paternity\" and an \"admission of paternity\"). While we agree with the Fort Worth Court of Appeals' analysis in\n   <em>\n    K.W.\n   </em>\n   , Oliver's handwritten note cannot be characterized as an unequivocal admission of paternity. Oliver makes a general reference to \"my kids\" in the note and expresses a desire to protect the children from the consequences of Dora's conduct, but he does not admit that he is the biological father of each of the three children. Further, the note does not express any opposition to termination of his parental rights because Oliver's agreement to comply with the service plan is contingent on Dora's failure to comply with the requirements imposed on her. We conclude that Oliver's handwritten note does not constitute an admission of paternity and it is insufficient to preclude summary\n   termination of his parental rights under Section 161.002(b)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    Presumption of Paternity\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Oliver additionally argues that he proved by uncontroverted evidence the existence of a common law marriage, and therefore, he is the presumed father of the children. The father-child relationship is established by an unrebutted presumption of the man's paternity of the child under Section 160.204 of the Texas Family Code. TEX.FAM.CODE ANN. \u00a7 160.201(b)(1).

Consistent with Pena's testimony, Dora testified that she and Oliver are not legally married, but they \"have been together for more than 15 years.\" Dora also asserted that she referred to Oliver as her husband, but when asked if they told other people they were married, Dora stated:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \"We tried getting married one time, but it just didn't work out like that so we just left it alone.\" The couple's cohabitation and Dora's reference to Oliver as her husband is insufficient to prove, as a matter of law, an agreement to be married. Consequently, Oliver failed to establish the existence of an informal marriage and he is not presumed to be the father of the children.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Having found the evidence both legally and factually sufficient to support the findings made by the trial court under Section 161.002(b)(1), we overrule Issue One.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    R.H. v.

The Family Code allows for the termination of an alleged father's parental rights if he fails to register with the paternity registry under specified circumstances.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX.FAM.CODE ANN. \u00a7 161.002(b)(2), (3), (4). The termination order is supported by the trial court's findings made under Section 161.002(b)(1). Consequently, it is unnecessary to address the merits of Issue Two. The judgment of the trial court terminating Oliver's parental rights is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    To protect the identity of the children, the opinion will refer to Appellant by the fictitious name \"Oliver\" and to D.L. by the fictitious name \"Dora\".\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Tex.R.App.P. 9.8. The trial court entered an order terminating Dora's parental rights to the children and Dora appealed.
