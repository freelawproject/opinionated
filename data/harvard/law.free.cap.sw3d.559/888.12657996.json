This Court agrees Mr. Grado has a constitutional right under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to effective assistance of counsel in defending against an attempt to commit him under the Act. Because Mr. Grado alleges his counsel's errors occurred in open court and so can be reviewed on the trial record, this Court does not reach the difficult issue of how such claims would be raised and determined for errors allegedly occurring off the record or on appeal, in light of the lack of a post-hearing process applicable to civil SVP commitments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This Court also need not decide whether Missouri will apply the \"meaningful hearing based on the record\" standard for ineffective assistance of counsel now applied in Missouri termination of parental rights cases as suggested by the State,\n   <em>\n    In Interest of J.P.B.,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12370955\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/509/84/#p97\">\n     509 S.W.3d 84\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 97 (Mo. banc 2017)\n   </em>\n   , or the\n   <em>\n    Strickland v.

This evidence was admissible because the State's expert relied on it in assessing Mr. Grado's diagnosis and risk of re-offense. He had a meaningful hearing and it was a matter of trial strategy to determine whether the impact of this evidence would be minimized were it also discussed by Mr. Grado's counsel. For the reasons set out below, this Court also rejects Mr. Grado's claim there was insufficient evidence to support the finding he was an SVP as well as his claim he was insufficiently mature at the time of committing the index offense at age 18 for it to be constitutional to find he is an SVP as that finding allegedly becomes, in effect, a sentence of commitment for life. The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I. PROCEDURAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On October 16, 2014, while Mr. Grado was serving three concurrent five-year sentences for first-degree child molestation, the State filed the underlying petition seeking to have Mr. Grado committed as\n   an SVP\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   . The probate division of the circuit court held a three-day jury trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   To have Mr. Grado committed as an SVP, the State was required to prove he had been convicted of an \"index\" sexually violent offense\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and has a mental abnormality making him more likely than not to commit a future act of sexual predatory violence unless confined to a secure facility.\n   <em>\n    \u00a7 632.480(5).\n   </em>\n   To meet its burden, the State presented testimony from Dr. Lisa Witcher, a licensed psychologist hired by the Missouri Department of Mental Health to perform an SVP examination of Mr. Grado. Dr. Witcher testified based on her interview of Mr. Grado and on her review of an abundance of his records from elementary and high school all the way through his incarceration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Here, Mr. Grado's index offense was his three convictions of first-degree child molestation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In pleading guilty, Dr. Witcher testified, Mr. Grado admitted when he was 18 years old he engaged in sexual contact with three children all under the age of seven. He started with his five-year-old nephew. He told his nephew they were playing a \"game\" where they pretended to be \"in a dream.\" He then proceeded to play a game of truth or dare, and Mr. Grado pulled down his pants and showed his nephew his genitals. He played a similar \"game\" with his six-year-old niece and his niece and nephew's seven-year-old cousin, only the \"game\" escalated and he \"dared\" the two girls to put their hands and mouths on his genitals. On other occasions, he tried to manipulate the three children into performing oral sex on him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In addition to his index offense, Dr. Witcher testified Mr. Grado had multiple prior instances of sexual abuse of children. When he was 14, Mr. Grado had his one-year-old nephew place his hand on Mr. Grado's penis while he was masturbating. At 15, Mr. Grado and an eight- or nine-year-old boy touched one another's genitals, and Mr. Grado had the boy perform oral sex on him. Mr. Grado continued to have sexual interactions with that same boy multiple times over approximately a six-month period. Because Mr. Grado received sexual gratification from these interactions, Dr. Witcher diagnosed him with the paraphilia of pedophilic disorder non-exclusive type, sexually attracted to both males and females. Dr. Witcher further testified that because Mr. Grado continued to engage in predatory sexual conduct despite reporting feeling guilty for his conduct, he suffered from a mental abnormality that caused him serious difficulty in controlling his behavior.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Dr. Witcher also scored Mr. Grado on the Static 99-R and Static 2002-R, actuarial instruments used to determine Mr. Grado's risk. The Static 99-R and Static 2000-R placed him in the moderate to high risk category and moderate risk category to be reconvicted, respectively. In addition, Dr. Witcher testified Mr. Grado demonstrated several other risk factors, including his emotional congruence with children (Mr.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Grado thought the child victims were his friends), sexual impulsivity, strong manipulation techniques, and sexual attraction to animals. Because of his sexual attraction to animals, Dr. Witcher diagnosed Mr. Grado with zoophilia, which is also a paraphilia. She testified he was at an increased risk to reoffend because he had two paraphilias. Based on the totality of Mr. Grado's behaviors, Dr. Witcher gave her opinion to a reasonable degree of psychological certainty he would commit future acts of predatory sexual violence unless confined in a secure facility, and Mr. Grado met the criteria of an SVP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The State also presented testimony from Robert Gould, the operations manager for MOSOP and the primary therapist for Mr. Grado's group in the program. Mr. Gould testified that throughout the program Mr. Grado \"discussed more readily, more frequently, the interactions with animals\" and \"did not as readily discuss the human victims, child victims and\" admitted watching animated pornography featuring half-human, half-animal adult characters with exaggerated sexual features and playing a pedophilic video game which involved grooming techniques similar to those Mr. Grado used on his child victims. Mr. Grado maintained throughout MOSOP he was not a risk to children, but Mr. Gould testified he observed nothing during treatment which would signal Mr. Grado was no longer sexually attracted to children as well as animals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Mr. Grado testified on his own behalf that he began to become sexually attracted to animals after watching animalistic pornography. At around the same time he also started playing a pedophilic video game and began molesting his index offense victims. In addition to testifying about his sexual history with children and animals, Mr. Grado stated sometimes, although not often, he had deviant sexual fantasies about his victims but would usually be able to divert his thoughts. He did not believe he was still sexually attracted to children but was unwilling to say whether he was still attracted to them until he got \"a complete grasp of [his] sexuality.\" Mr. Grado believed he could still easily manipulate children and was unsure if he would reoffend if left alone with a child. He unequivocally recognized animals continued to be a sexual trigger for him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Mr. Grado's mother and brother also testified regarding Mr. Grado's childhood and their support of him. Mr. Grado's counsel also presented expert testimony from Dr. Richard Wollert, a clinical and forensic psychiatrist. Dr. Wollert generally discussed research on the developmental psychology of persons from the age of 12 through their mid-20s, specifically noting the part of the brain controlling foresight, judgment, and decision making continues to develop into the \"mid-20s.\" Dr. Wollert had not evaluated Mr. Grado, however, and so was unable to testify whether this research applied to him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The jury found Mr. Grado to be an SVP, and the circuit court ordered him to be committed to the Department of Mental Health for control, care, and treatment. This appeal followed.\n   <em>\n    Mo. Const. art V, \u00a7 10\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     II. INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL CLAIMS\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Mr. Grado argues he has a due process right to effective assistance of counsel in his SVP proceeding because his commitment as an SVP implicates his fundamental liberty interest. He also alleges the statutory right to assistance of counsel under sections 632.489 and 632.492 mandates counsel be effective. The State acknowledges this Court previously held an SVP has a constitutionally protected liberty interest, but asks the Court to reconsider\n   this issue and hold there is no due process or statutory right to effective assistance of counsel in SVP proceedings. \"This Court reviews [such] issues of law\n   <em>\n    de novo.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Murrell v.

SVPs Have a Due Process Right to Effective Assistance of Counsel\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The State argues that even if an SVP has a due process right to counsel, the Constitution does not guarantee appointed counsel must be effective. In support, it notes Rules 24.035 and 29.15 provide for the appointment of counsel in postconviction proceedings, yet this Court has held this does not guarantee the postconviction movant has the right to effective assistance of counsel. The State's argument ignores the fundamental distinction between a postconviction proceeding and an SVP commitment proceeding. A postconviction proceeding is a \"collateral attack on a final judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Barnett v.

These original actions are brought by the State and result in a proceeding in which the courts determine in the first instance whether the person's liberty will be taken away. Counsel in these proceedings help to protect the individual from having a fundamental right of liberty taken away. The SVP proceeding is in this way more comparable to the trial of a criminal defendant than to the criminal defendant's postconviction proceeding. In the criminal context, this Court has recognized the right to counsel means the right to effective counsel.\n   <em>\n    See State ex rel. Mo. Pub. Defender Comm'n v.

The State's expert Dr. Witcher testified that part of the\n   evidence on which she based her diagnosis that Mr. Grado had pedophilia was the fact he showed pornography to a child he abused. Dr. Witcher also testified that a person with two paraphilias was at an increased risk to reoffend.

In explaining the basis of this diagnosis she discussed his sexual activity with animals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   This tied in with testimony by Mr. Gould that Mr. Grado disclosed while in MOSOP that he played a video game where an adult babysitter would earn \"trust points\" with the children by performing certain tasks; those \"points\" could then be traded for sexual interactions between the child and babysitter. Mr. Gould found the game \"strikingly parallel\" to the manipulation tactics Mr. Grado used on his own victims. Mr. Gould also stated Mr. Grado watched pornography featuring half-human, half-animal characters. Finally, Mr. Gould testified about Mr. Grado's sexual attraction to animals and stated Mr. Grado more willingly discussed his interactions with animals than with children. Dr. Witcher also testified she reviewed all of Mr. Grado's MOSOP records and his \"grooming behavior\" increased his risk because it reflected \"planning and forethought.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Mr. Grado does not argue counsel was ineffective in failing to limit the use of this evidence, but rather argues it was inadmissible.

She testified Mr. Grado, at age 15, offended against a child \"between the ages of eight and ten,\" and she believed Mr. Grado continued to offend against that same child when Mr. Grado turned 16 years old. He did the same thing two years later when he committed his index offense at age 18, and the jury also heard testimony Mr. Grado continued to have sexual urges while serving his prison sentence and up until the time of trial at age 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Further, Dr. Witcher specifically testified that in reviewing Mr. Grado's records and reports, \"he was bothered by his behavior\" and had \"the thoughts going: I don't think this is right. I feel kind of bad about this. I'm not sure this is okay, which causes distress.\" During Mr. Grado's self-evaluation, Dr. Witcher stated Mr. Grado was able to \"at least retrospectively\" identify \"feelings of guilt\" as they related to his child victims, but nevertheless continued the sexual predatory behavior anyways. Based on her review of Mr. Grado's records and interviews with him, Dr. Witcher testified his pedophilic disorder rose to the level of a mental abnormality because \"it, A, resulted in a sexually violent offense; and then, B, it's been shown to affect his ability to control his behavior.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Mr. Grado alleges any acts occurring before the age of 16 cannot be relied on and the evidence was vague as to his and the child's ages when he offended. He also argues the State failed to prove a direct link showing the acts were caused by pedophilic urges or that his pedophilic urges caused marked distress or interpersonal difficulty, rather than simply being acts of adolescent sexual exploration.

He continued to have pedophilic urges up until the time of trial, as well as another philia, and the jury heard these sexual urges and behaviors caused him distress. It also heard testimony that based on Mr. Grado's prior behavior, his pedophilic disorder predisposed him to sexually violent behavior, which he engaged in, and was unsure he could control. Based on this evidence and the reasonable inferences it supports, there was sufficient evidence for a reasonable juror to find he met the criteria for pedophilic disorder and suffered from a mental abnormality.

But the jury was entitled to look at the evidence as a whole. The jury heard Dr. Witcher's expert opinion that Mr. Grado was more likely to do so unless confined. She extensively testified regarding the basis for her opinion. That basis included not just Mr. Grado's score on various diagnostic criteria, but also his pedophilic disorder and zoophilia diagnoses, prior sexual history, sexual impulsivity and promiscuity, emotional congruence with children, strong manipulation techniques, and inability to control his sexual interactions with animals.

I further concur with the principal opinion's holding Grado did not receive ineffective assistance of counsel. However, the principal opinion did not reach or resolve the issue concerning which standard should apply when a civilly committed sexually violent predator (hereinafter, \"SVP\") raises ineffective assistance of counsel claims.

After reviewing a wealth of persuasive legal authority from other jurisdictions implementing the same standard under the same circumstances, had the principal opinion addressed the matter, I believe it would be clear these claims should be reviewed under the standard set forth in\n   <em>\n    Strickland v.

This is the same standard that applies in termination of parental rights cases.\n   <em>\n    In Interest of J.P.B.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12370955\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/509/84/#p97\">\n    509 S.W.3d 84\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 97 (Mo. banc 2017). However, the state cannot cite any legal authority-from Missouri or other jurisdictions-applying such a minimal standard to SVP proceedings. In contrast, Grado cites widespread support in other jurisdictions to apply\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   to involuntary commitments generally and specifically to SVP proceedings, which result in a form of involuntary commitment. I believe these cases constitute persuasive authority for this Court to adopt the\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   standard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   When examining involuntary commitment proceedings generally, courts apply the\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   standard.

An SVP's right to counsel arises from a constitutional right to due process, similar to-albeit distinct from-the Sixth Amendment right to counsel, and the right exists because it is the SVP's liberty that is affected, similar to a criminal commitment. The right to counsel arises from the Fourteenth Amendment and protects the individual from an unlawful infringement on liberty, similar to a criminal commitment.
