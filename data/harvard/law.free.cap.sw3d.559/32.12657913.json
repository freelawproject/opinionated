The measure was introduced and ultimately passed by the General Assembly as H.B. 1460. Appellants asserted that H.B. 1460 is unconstitutional due to procedural infirmities. The circuit court entered judgment on the pleadings in favor of the Secretary of State. The case is not ripe for pre-election judicial review. Pursuant to Rule 84.14,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   this court issues the judgment that the trial court should have entered and dismisses the petition without prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   H.B. 1460 was first introduced and read in the Missouri House of Representatives on January 3, 2018, as a bill with the title, \"AN ACT To repeal section 143.121, RSMo, and to enact in lieu thereof one new section relating to a tax deduction for certain Olympic athletes.\" On May 18, 2018, the Missouri Senate third read and passed Senate Substitute 2 for H.B. 1460. The same day, the Missouri House truly agreed and finally passed Senate Substitute 2 for H.B. 1460. When H.B. 1460 was finally passed, its title was, \"AN ACT To repeal sections 142.803 and 143.121, RSMo, and to enact in lieu thereof three new sections relating to state revenues, with a referendum clause.\" The Speaker of the House and Pro Tem of the Senate signed H.B. 1460 on May 30, 2018, and H.B. 1460 was delivered to the Secretary of State's Office that day. The General Assembly included an official ballot title, including a summary statement and fiscal note summary. On June 1, 2018, the Secretary of State certified the General Assembly's official ballot title.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Appellants filed this lawsuit against the Secretary of State and others on July 2, 2018. They claimed that H.B. 1460 violates the Missouri Constitution's original purpose, single-subject, and clear-title requirements in Article III, sections 21 and 23 of the Missouri Constitution. They also claimed Article III, sections 21 and 23 were violated when H.B. 1460's title was changed during the amendment process. SaferMO.com, a political action committee and supporter of the ballot measure, and its treasurer, Terry Briggs, filed a motion to intervene, and the trial court sustained the motion. The Secretary and other defendants filed a motion to dismiss based on ripeness or, in the alternative, motion for judgment on the pleadings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Following written and oral arguments of the parties, the circuit court entered judgment in favor of the Secretary of State and other defendants. It found that the case is ripe and that H.B. 1460 does not clearly and undoubtedly violate article III, sections 21 and 23. This appeal by Appellants followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    Ripeness\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Before addressing Appellants' claims that H.B. 1460 violates\n   article III, sections 21 and 23, this court must determine whether the issues present a justiciable controversy.

Nothing in the constitutional provisions relating to procedure and form of referendums ordered by the general assembly supports pre-election judicial review of Appellants' claims under article III, sections 21 and 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Similarly, nothing in Chapter 116, which applies to elections on statewide ballot measures, supports pre-election judicial review in this case.

Furthermore, section 116.200 does not apply to a referendum ordered by the general assembly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In sum, the constitutional and statutory provisions relating to the procedure and form of referendums ordered by the general assembly do not support pre-election review of Appellants' challenges under article III, sections 21 and 23. And because H.B. 1460 may never be enacted by voters, Appellants' claims are not ripe. Pursuant to Rule 84.14, this court will issue the ruling that the trial court should have entered. The Appellants' petition is dismissed without prejudice.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Schweich\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7091348\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/408/769/#p773\">\n    408 S.W.3d at 779\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (dismissing without prejudice under Rule 84.14 where claim not ripe).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   All concur.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-37\">\n    \"The appellate court shall award a new trial or partial new trial, reverse or affirm the judgment or order of the trial court, in whole or in part, or give such judgment as the court ought to give.

A challenge to a bill brought after it is adopted by the general assembly but before the governor takes action to sign or veto the bill would not be considered by this court as it would not be ripe.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
