Ransom appeals, arguing that the trial court abused its discretion by admitting certain evidence and plainly erred by failing to properly instruct the jury. We affirm. Because a published opinion would have no precedential value, we have provided the parties an unpublished memorandum setting forth the reasons for this order. Rule 30.25(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
