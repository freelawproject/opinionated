Goodwin and Stephen Hawke of the attorney general's office in Jefferson City, (573) 751-3321.\n </attorneys>\n <opinion>\n  <p id=\"p-7\">\n   Laura Denvir Stith, Judge\n   Gordon Goldsby appeals the circuit court's decision dismissing his petition asking the court to order the Missouri Department of Corrections to provide him with a release date for his life sentence for rape. This Court rejects DOC's argument that the Court did not acquire jurisdiction of the appeal because Mr. Goldsby failed to timely file either a docket fee or a motion to proceed in forma pauperis with his notice of appeal. Rule 81.04's docket fee requirement is not jurisdictional. Under Rule 84.01, the failure to timely file a docket fee is cause for dismissal of the appeal if the fee or permission to proceed in forma pauperis are not obtained thereafter. Mr. Goldsby filed his docket fee within 11 days of the filing of his notice of appeal and, therefore, his appeal was timely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-8\">\n   The circuit court correctly refused to require DOC to provide Mr. Goldsby with a final release date from his life sentence. His reliance on the \"three-fourths rule\" adopted in 1865 is unavailing. Since at least 1879, it has not applied to life sentences and has never applied to persons such as Mr. Goldsby who have conduct violations. As a person serving a life sentence, Mr. Goldsby has no release date, and the court below did not err in sustaining DOC's motion to dismiss and refusing to order it to set a release date for Mr. Goldsby.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In 1990, a jury found Gordon Goldsby guilty of kidnapping under section 559.240,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   rape under section 559.260, and assault with intent to do great bodily harm with malice aforethought under section 559.180, for crimes he committed in 1972. The court sentenced Mr. Goldsby to consecutive prison sentences of 10 years, life, and 25 years, respectively. In 2015, by which time Mr. Goldsby had served his sentence for kidnapping and was serving his life sentence for rape, he filed a petition seeking a declaration of his right to release from prison, arguing DOC improperly refused to provide him with a calculation of the date his life sentence would end. DOC filed a motion to dismiss, attached prior cases brought by Mr. Goldsby seeking release that had ended in dismissal, and indicated the courts' rationale in denying release in those cases supported refusing to set a release date in the instant case. On June 27, 2016, the circuit court entered a judgment dismissing the petition \"for the reasons stated in the motion.\" The judgment became final 30 days later on July 27, 2016. Mr. Goldsby had 10 days to file his notice of appeal pursuant to Rule 81.04.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Mr. Goldsby mailed a notice of appeal to the circuit court on July 28, 2016, including a note informing the clerk he had submitted a request for funds to be transferred\n   from his inmate account to cover the docket fee. The clerk received the notice of appeal on August 5, 2016, which was within the 10-day period for filing a notice of appeal. The clerk notified Mr. Goldsby he still needed to pay the docket fee for the notice of appeal to take effect. On August 17, 2016, the clerk received and acknowledged receipt of the docket fee and stamped the notice of appeal as filed, but the court of appeals subsequently dismissed the appeal as untimely due to failure to timely file the docket fee. This Court granted transfer.\n   <em>\n    Mo. Const. art. V, \u00a7 10\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Rule 83.02.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     II.

Here, the circuit clerk acknowledged the receipt of Mr. Goldsby's docket fee only 11 days after his judgment became final. Under Rule 84.08, his notice of appeal was timely and having remedied the defect in failing to file the docket fee with the notice of appeal within 15 days, the appellate court erred in dismissing his appeal as untimely.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-41\">\n    <strong>\n     <em>\n      IV.

Mr. Goldsby notes, under section 216.355, certain persons serving term-of-year sentences were entitled to release once they had served three-fourths of their sentence. This became known as the \"three-fourths rule.\"\n    <em>\n     Parrish v.

While section 216.355 does not expressly provide it applies to those serving a life sentence, Mr. Goldsby's petition argues it does because \"[t]he original statute '[Convicts]' (1879) para 2., stated that 9/12ths of a life sentence is 15 years, thus, 12/12ths should be a simple mathematical equation, resulting in a term of years, at 20 years.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-43\">\n    Mr. Goldsby acknowledges section 216.355 was repealed when the criminal code was revised effective in 1979 and does not apply to crimes committed thereafter.\n    <em>\n     \u00a7 216.355\n    </em>\n    (repealed 1977);\n    <em>\n     \u00a7 558.011, RSMo Supp. 1979.\n    </em>\n    But he says the section was still in effect when he committed the rape in 1972 and, therefore, it applies to him under section 556.031, RSMo Supp. 1979,\n    <footnotemark>\n     6\n    </footnotemark>\n    and requires DOC to calculate his release date as 20 years from the date he began to serve his rape sentence in 1997.\n    <footnotemark>\n     7\n    </footnotemark>\n    DOC argues, to the contrary, his life sentence is of indeterminate length so he has\n    no release date, although DOC has notified Mr. Goldsby it has scheduled a parole hearing for January 2020.\n    <footnotemark>\n     8\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    For numerous reasons, DOC is correct that section 216.355 does not require it to set a release date for Mr. Goldsby. This is best explained by examining the history of the \"three-fourths rule\" on which Mr. Goldsby relies. The original version of that law was adopted in 1865 in an act titled \"Convicts,\" which provided:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n    \u00a7 1 That when any person imprisoned in the Penitentiary of the State of Missouri shall have, during the whole time of his or her imprisonment, behaved according to the rules and regulations of that institution, to the full satisfaction of the Inspectors, then the said Inspectors, on the expiration of three-fourths of the time for which such person was sentenced, shall write and sign a testimony to that effect and present the same to the Governor of Missouri, with a recommendation that such person be pardoned.\n   </blockquote>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n    \u00a7 2 That the same shall be done in regard to the persons under the sentence of imprisonment for life, after having been imprisoned for fifteen years and complied with the conditions named in the foregoing section.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    <em>\n     Mo. Laws 1865-6, p.19, \u00a7 1-2.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-48\">\n    By its terms, the 1865 law cited by Mr. Goldsby applied only to those who served without violating any rules or regulations. Mr. Goldsby has had 15 conduct violations. The statute also did not entitle the prisoner to release but merely to a recommendation of release, which was then left to the governor's discretion.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9926598\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/589/74/#p77\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Finally, it did not provide that 15 years was three-fourths of a life sentence so that a life sentence would be construed as 20 years, as Mr. Goldsby seems to contend. It simply provided those serving life sentences were entitled to a recommendation for release just as were those who had served three-fourths of their term-of-years sentence, if they had good behavior. For all of these reasons, even were the 1865 law still in effect it would not provide a basis to require DOC to determine a release date for Mr. Goldsby's life sentence.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    Equally important, no law equivalent to section 2 of the 1865 law is now in effect. The 1865 \"three-fourths rule\" law was amended in 1879 when the legislature adopted Mo. Laws 1879, \u00a7 6533. As codified, the statute contained only section 1 of the 1865 law, which it amended to provide that prisoners who served without conduct violations could be released after serving three-fourths of their sentence as if they had served their full terms without the need for a gubernatorial pardon:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n    Any convict who is now or may hereafter be confined in the penitentiary, and who shall serve three-fourths of the time for which he or she may have been sentenced in an orderly and peaceable manner, without having any such infraction of the rules of the prison or laws of the same recorded against such convict, he or she shall be discharged in the same manner as if said convict had served the full time for which sentenced, and in such case no pardon from the governor shall be required.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-51\">\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9926598\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw2d/589/74/#p77\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n     \u00a7 6533.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-52\">\n    The section of the 1865 law formerly providing for release of those with a life\n    sentence on good behavior after serving 15 years is conspicuously absent from the 1879 statute.
