(Appellants)\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   appeal from a decision of the Court of\n   Appeals which reversed the order of the Franklin Circuit Court that granted partial summary judgment to Appellants in a dispute concerning various statutory amendments to the Kentucky Affordable Prepaid Tuition Fund (KAPT) contracts previously purchased by the Appellants. Appellees are the Board of Directors for the Commonwealth Postsecondary Education Prepaid Tuition Trust Fund (Board) and its individual members named in their official capacities; the Kentucky Higher Education Assistance Authority; and the Finance and Administration Cabinet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   The Court of Appeals disagreed with the trial court's legal conclusion regarding the retroactive application of the 2014 statutory changes affecting the 2003 contracts for prepaid college tuition entered into by Maze and the Board. The Court of Appeals interpreted those contracts as providing, in association with their enabling statutes, that KAPT participants like Maze, and others similarly situated, had expressly agreed to be bound by amendments to the contracts imposed by future statutory and regulatory changes. The Court of Appeals thus concluded that the 2014 amendments validly altered Appellants' contracts. The Court of Appeals reversed the trial court and held that the Appellees, rather than Maze, should have been granted summary judgment as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   For the reasons stated below, we conclude that the KAPT contracts executed by Maze and those similarly situated, and the underlying enabling statutes, do not authorize the contractual changes imposed by the retroactive application of the statutory amendments involved here, and that the retroactive imposition of those amendments upon Maze unlawfully impairs her contracts in violation of U.S. Const. Art. I \u00a7 10, cl. 1. and Ky. Const. \u00a7 19. Accordingly, we reverse the Court of Appeals and reinstate the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The material facts are not in dispute and may be summarized as follows. In 2000, the Kentucky General Assembly enacted KRS 164A.700 - 164A.709, establishing the Commonwealth Postsecondary Education Prepaid Tuition Trust Fund, also known as the Kentucky Affordable Prepaid Tuition Fund, or KAPT. This program allowed and encouraged Kentucky families with pre-college aged children to contract with the KAPT Board to \"lock in\" the current tuition rates for future attendance at a public university in Kentucky.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Allowing the prepayment of college tuition permitted the parents of young children to insure against future increases in tuition rates. KRS 164A.701(2)(b) identifies KAPT's primary goal as, \"provid[ing] students and their parents economic protection against rising tuition costs.\" In addition to the statutory provisions of KRS Chapter 164A, KAPT contracts are governed by the KAPT \"Master Agreement\" whose provisions track the enabling statutory language, generally providing that a contract participant will be guaranteed the state college\n   tuition rate existing at the time the participant entered into the program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Of crucial significance to our analysis, KRS 164A.705(1) expresses an unequivocal assurance to plan participants that they will receive the benefits they purchased as promised: \"The prepaid tuition contract entered into by the purchaser and the board shall constitute an irrevocable pledge and guarantee by the fund to pay for the tuition of a qualified beneficiary upon acceptance and enrollment at an eligible educational institution in accordance with the tuition plan purchased.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In January 2003, Maze purchased a KAPT \"Standard Plan\" contract for the benefit of each of her three sons. She listed their Projected College Entrance Years (PCEY) as 2008, 2010, and 2013, respectively. The Standard Plan contracts permitted purchasers to pre-pay at the time of purchase up to five years of tuition at the then-current cost of full-time tuition at Kentucky's most expensive public university. The payments could be paid in a single lump sum, or through a monthly payment plan. The Plan covered both undergraduate and graduate school tuition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   With those purchases, Maze entered into a Master Agreement which incorporated \"the terms and provisions of KAPT Regulations and KRS 164A.700 -709, as may be amended from time to time.\" At the time of Maze's purchase, neither the KAPT contracts themselves nor the statutes governing KAPT contained a time limitation within which the prepaid tuition must be used; nor did the contracts and governing statutes provide a time limit after which the plan would cover something less than the full cost of tuition at any of Kentucky's public universities. Maze fulfilled all of her obligations under the KAPT agreements. When their time of college enrollment came, two of Maze's sons received substantial academic scholarships, and they did not need immediate use of their prepaid tuition. They intended to apply their KAPT funds toward graduate school tuition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     2014 Legislative Changes\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In 2014, with the enactment of House Bill 279, the General Assembly made several significant changes to the KAPT program that affected the contracts Maze had purchased eleven years earlier. Among the amendments was the imposition of a newly devised \"utilization period,\" which for the first time imposed time limitations upon the KAPT contracts. The legislation defined the \"utilization period\" as \"the period of time in which a prepaid tuition contract is to be used beginning with the projected college year and continuing for the number of prepaid tuition years purchased.\" KRS 164A.700(18).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The statutorily imposed condition operated retroactively to cover the contracts that Maze, and others, had purchased and paid for. Under this new provision, a KAPT plan participant who had purchased four years of prepaid tuition, with a projected college entry year of 2008, would have to use up the prepaid tuition before the end of 2012. Under the statutory change, plan participants lost the option of reserving their use of prepaid tuition for tuition needs beyond the \"utilization period.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The statutory changes also added a limit on the extent to which a purchased plan would cover the inflation of future college tuition. Maze's KAPT contracts had no such limitation. House Bill (HB) 279 amended KRS 164A.705(7) to provide:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   During an account's utilization period, the value of the prepaid tuition account shall increase consistent with tuition rates for the applicable tuition plan and academic year. If all tuition benefits have not been used at the conclusion of [the utilization] period, the account value shall increase at a rate of three percent (3%) per annum or the applicable tuition plan value increase, whichever is less, for a period not to exceed two (2) additional years. No additional value shall be added to a prepaid tuition account after two (2) years past the utilization period [ (2014 for Maze's oldest child) ].\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Finally, the 2014 amendments also set June 30, 2028 as the termination date of the KAPT program, requiring that any prepaid tuition not used by that date be refunded to the purchaser. KRS 164A.709(8).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   These legislative actions appear to have been an attempt to correct for a significant miscalculation in the financial viability of the program from its inception. In the years following the creation of the KAPT program, college tuition for public universities in Kentucky increased at rates well beyond what was anticipated and well beyond the growth of the fund managed by the KAPT Board, resulting in a substantial unfunded liability in the program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On July 14, 2015, Maze filed a Complaint and Petition, on behalf of herself and \"Unknown Similarly Situated Purchasers of KAPT Contracts,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   seeking declaratory and injunctive relief against the enforcement of the 2014 amendments. At the time of her Complaint, unused KAPT funds remained available in all three of her accounts. Maze asserts that her sons intended to apply the funds in their KAPT accounts to their graduate school tuition, which would fall outside of the \"utilization period\" established under the 2014 KAPT amendments. Citing this provision and the newly imposed cap on the growth-rate value of her accounts, she alleges that the 2014 amendments to KAPT unconstitutionally impaired the value and obligations of her contracts with the Board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The trial court overruled the Board's motion and granted summary judgment to Maze. The trial court agreed with Maze that the language of the KAPT Master Agreement and its underlying enabling statutes do not demonstrate an intention of the parties that amendments of the kind enacted by the 2014 legislation would retroactively apply to their 2003 contract. Proceeding to the constitutional question, the trial court concluded that the 2014 amendments to KAPT were an unjustified and unconstitutional impairment of her contract rights under the Master Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In contrast, the Court of Appeals interpreted the applicable contracts as expressing the parties' agreement that subsequent amendments to the governing statutes and regulations would change the terms and conditions of their existing contracts, thus interpreting the retroactive application of the 2014 amendments as permissible. Accordingly, the Court of Appeals reversed the summary judgment granted to Maze and ordered the entry of judgment for the Board. We granted discretionary review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

THE KAPT CONTRACTS EXECUTED BY THE PARTIES DO NOT CONFER THE UNLIMITED AUTHORITY TO THE LEGISLATURE TO RETROACTIVELY AMEND THE CONTRACTS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The Court of Appeals concluded, and the Appellees continue to argue, that the KAPT statutes and associated Master Agreement that existed in 2003 when Maze purchased her plans express her agreement to accept\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   subsequent legislative changes to the terms and conditions of the KAPT program, including the retroactive application of the 2014 legislative changes. Appellees contend that the 2014 amendments fall squarely within the language of the applicable 2003 KAPT statutes and associated Master Agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   If Appellees are correct in their construction of the relevant statutory and the Master Agreement language, our inquiry ends. If the plan participants had agreed that such changes would be accepted, the retroactive amendments would be clearly applicable. Maze's claim would fail, and we would not reach the constitutional question. Therefore, we begin our analysis with an examination of the text of the Master Agreement and the associated statutory enabling language to see if the KAPT program includes provisions conferring broad discretion upon the legislature to amend the program and to impose retroactive application of those amendments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    A.

Maze contends that the specificity of Section 10.08 with respect to the nature of allowable retroactive amendments to the KAPT agreement means that, under traditional rules of contract interpretation, it takes precedence over the more general amendment authority provided by Article II Section 2.09. Under her construction of the applicable provision, she consented to be bound only by amendments necessary \"to assure compliance with applicable state or federal law or regulations or to preserve favorable tax treatment of the KAPT program.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Appellees argue that these provisions do not conflict, that Section 10.08 merely provides one specific reason to accept amendments\n   to the Master Agreement, and that Section 2.09 demonstrates the parties' agreement that the Master Agreement, as a whole, would track changes in state law with retroactive effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The Court of Appeals relied heavily upon KRS 164A.707(9), a component of the original KAPT legislation that remained unchanged by the 2014 legislation. KRS 164A.707(9) states as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   Each prepaid tuition contract is subject to, and shall incorporate by reference,\n   <em>\n    all operating procedures and policies\n   </em>\n   adopted by the board, the statutes governing prepaid tuition contracts in KRS 164A.700 to 164A.709 and 393.015, and administrative regulations promulgated thereunder.\n   <em>\n    Any amendments to statutes, administrative regulations, and operating procedures and policies shall automatically amend prepaid tuition contracts, with retroactive or prospective effect, as applicable.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   (emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   According to the Court of Appeals, KRS 164A.707(9)\"expresses the General Assembly's intent that amendments to the statutes and regulations regarding KAPT will have retroactive effect.\" Thus, the Court of Appeals construed this provision, incorporated into the original KAPT agreement, as a manifestation of the parties' intent for retroactive application of any statutory or regulatory amendments to the KAPT plan. The Court of Appeals reasoned that Section 10.08 operated \"in addition to, and not in conflict with,\" Section 2.09's general provision concerning retroactivity; and that Section 10.08 merely describes one instance in which statutory amendments to the terms and conditions of the KAPT contract will apply retroactively. The Court of Appeals reasoned that Maze's construction of the Master Agreement giving precedence to the specificity of Section 10.08 \"would render Section 2.09 and its final sentence meaningless.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    B. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   As part of the KAPT program's legislative foundation, KRS 164A.705(1) expresses an unequivocal assurance to plan participants that they will receive all of the benefits they purchased: \"The prepaid tuition contract entered into by the purchaser and the board shall constitute an irrevocable pledge and guarantee by the fund to pay for the tuition of a qualified beneficiary upon acceptance and enrollment at an eligible educational institution in accordance with the tuition plan purchased.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Ordinarily, no special written language is necessary to assure contracting parties that, if they perform their contractual obligations, they are entitled to receive the bargained for performance of the other party. The contract itself provides the assurance that a promise will be kept; that is inherent in the concept of a contract. KRS 164A.705(1) is the legislature's imprimatur of respect for KAPT's obligations. In light of KRS 164A.705(1) 's direct and unambiguous assurance that the benefits promised to KAPT plan purchasers will be delivered to KAPT plan purchasers, we find it impossible to conceive that the General Assembly would, in reality, assert the power to reduce the bargained-for benefit of KAPT program participants through subsequent modification authorized by the murky language of KRS 164A.707(9) for retroactive effect of statutory amendments, \"as applicable.\" Under the established rule that a statute is to be interpreted in accordance with its plain language, we will begin with the presumption that the retroactive 2014 amendments conflict with straight-forward \"irrevocable pledge\" language. The Court of Appeals' conclusion that Maze and her fellow KAPT plan participants agreed to a contractual\n   provision giving the legislature\n   <em>\n    carte blanche\n   </em>\n   authority to retroactively modify KAPT plans at its discretion is contrary to the \"irrevocable pledge\" language contained in KRS 164A.705(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In reaching this interpretation, we also follow the doctrine of \"\n   <em>\n    contra proferentem\n   </em>\n   : When interpreting contracts susceptible to two meanings, we construe ambiguity against the drafter....\"\n   <em>\n    Majestic Oaks Homeowners Association, Inc. v.

Here, the Commonwealth, as guarantor of the KAPT plan, was the drafter of the Master Agreement and the enabling statutes, and so, to the extent there is ambiguity in the relevant language, it is to be construed in favor of the plan participants and against the drafter. This is particularly so given the effortless ease with which the Master Agreement could have warned plan participants that KAPT plans were not, in fact, the \"locked in\" prepaid tuition benefits portrayed in the promotional material.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   By now adopting the position that the KAPT plan may be amended by the legislature for any reason, Appellees are, in effect, acknowledging that the Board's promise to pay the participant's future tuition was not an \"irrevocable pledge and guarantee by the fund to pay for the tuition.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   \"Within every contract, there is an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and contracts impose on the parties thereto a duty to do everything necessary to carry them out.\"\n   <em>\n    Farmers Bank and Trust Co. of Georgetown, Kentucky v.

Changing the KAPT plan in a way that impairs the benefits of participants seeking to educate their children violates this covenant. Unlike the Court of Appeals' conclusion, our interpretation of the relevant provisions avoids this result and reflects our confidence that the legislature does not intend the statutes to be interpreted in a way that undermines the Commonwealth's \"irrevocable pledge.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The interpretation endorsed by the Court of Appeals and the Appellees also results in an illusory contract. \"An illusory contract may be defined as an expression cloaked in promissory terms, but which, upon closer examination, reveals that the promisor has not committed himself in any manner.

Summary\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   In summary, we conclude that the trial court correctly interpreted the relevant statutory text and Master Agreement. The language of the contract reflects the agreement of Appellants to accept future amendments of the governing statutes only to the extent they are \"necessary to assure compliance with applicable state or federal law or regulations or to preserve favorable tax treatment of the KAPT program.\" The changes under review here do not fit within that limited category.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   Because the Court of Appeals concluded that Appellants, including Maze, by the language of the contracts, had consented to be bound to any future legislative changes, and thus had agreed to be bound to the 2014 changes, its opinion did not need to address the Impairment Clause issue. There is no Impairment Clause concern if the parties anticipated and agreed that future legislation could alter the terms of their contract.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Because we conclude that Appellants' contracts did not bind them to future legislative amendments of their contracts, we must look further to determine whether the impairment of contract clauses in our state and federal constitutions protect them from the legislative amendments to the terms of the contracts embodied in the 2014 legislation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.

Specifically, the 2014 KAPT amendments fundamentally altered Maze's contractual right to use, for her children, her KAPT funds for graduate school, and they directly curtailed the financial value of the benefit by capping future growth so that all of the promised tuition may not be paid. These changes were imposed retroactively, significantly devaluing the benefit promised to Maze. As noted previously, when Maze purchased her three KAPT contracts, the Master Agreement and its enabling statutes did not restrict her use of the funds to a specific time period, and the agreements did not cap the fund's growth. By imposing constraints not included in the original contract, the 2014 Amendments impose upon the participant a loss of the bargained-for benefit. If the prepaid tuition is not used within the newly-prescribed time frame, the \"irrevocable pledge\" that the tuition will be locked-in at the tuition rate in effect at the time the plan was purchased is substantially impaired. The 2028 sunset provision interjected into the agreement by the 2014 Amendments also reduces the value of the KAPT benefit, but perhaps to a lesser degree and with a fewer number of participants affected.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   Under the original Master Agreement, the student's ultimate use of KAPT's prepaid tuition was not affected by his PCEY (projected college entrance year), but the 2014 Amendments pegged the duration of the KAPT benefits to the specific time frame beginning in the PCEY. This new limit indirectly affects a participant's ability to transfer KAPT benefits among siblings or other relatives, which was an important selling point at the time Maze purchased her contracts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   According to the Appellees' own statistics, the cumulative financial detriment which will befall plan participants is $20.1 million, a significant impact by any measure. We conclude that the retroactive application of the 2014 amendments substantially impairs the contracts of Maze and the other similarly situated participants by extinguishing vested rights of the purchasers to benefits promised under the terms of the agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

They describe the amendments as an economic necessity brought about by dramatic increases in tuition at state universities in the years immediately following the beginning of the KAPT program. As a result of these unforeseen tuition increases, a significant unfunded liability, as much as $52.9 million, was created. Appellees note that the 2014 KAPT amendments would reduce the Commonwealth's unfunded KAPT liability by $20.1 million. Appellees also note the harmful effect upon the KAPT fund caused by KAPT accounts being held, rather than used for educational purposes.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   As noted by the trial court, reducing a large unfunded liability is an admirable objective, but it is not reasonable that the General Assembly would pursue that goal by impairing or devaluing the state's existing contractual obligations, created precisely in anticipation of rising tuition costs. The KAPT program was inspired and created by the legislature to protect participants from the rising costs of college tuition. Parents, like Maze and others, were induced to sign KAPT agreements because KAPT promotional material told them that college tuition was rising, and therefore, paying at today's lower prices guarded against future increases. The fact that the KAPT program's costs of performing its contractual obligations exceeded its own expectations does not justify altering the obligations so they more closely conform to its faulty expectations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    United States Trust\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    ,\n   </em>\n   the Supreme Court disapproved of the legislative impairment of contracts when the purported legitimate purpose related to government spending or saving, noting the states' self-interest as a concern.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States Trust Co.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1636\" index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/1/\">\n    431 U.S. at 26-27\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1636\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/1/\">\n    97 S.Ct. 1505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lynch v.

Indeed, the program was operating precisely as foreseen in permitting its participants to lock-in lower tuition rates as of the time they entered into the program. And while unexpectedly high tuition increases resulted in a $52 million underfunding (perhaps exacerbated by a deficient investment strategy of KAPT managers), these \"unforeseen\" events are not such that the General Assembly may self-servingly renounce its debts and impair $20.1 million dollars in benefits owed to the plan participants pursuant to the agreements. We also note that the legislature was not totally powerless with respect to control over the cost of tuition at state universities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Similarly, a state is not free to impose a drastic impairment when an evident and more moderate course would serve its purposes equally well.\n   <em>\n    United States Trust Co.,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1636\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/1/\">\n    431 U.S. at 32\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1636\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/431/1/\">\n    97 S.Ct. 1505\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While it is likely true that the Commonwealth could not have achieved the same level of savings, $20.1 million dollars, without modification of the KAPT agreements, there are, in fact, other less drastic modifications which could have been made, as were noted by the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   It follows that the 2014 KAPT amendments are neither reasonable nor necessary, and the state may not escape an unfavorable contract with retroactive legislation that substantially impairs the state's contractual obligations. This result is prohibited by the respective Contract Clauses of the United States and Kentucky Constitutions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    V. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   For the reasons stated above we conclude that the KAPT contracts executed by Maze and those similarly situated, and the underlying enabling statutes, do not provide for retroactive amendments such as those at issue here. We further conclude that the enactment of those retroactive amendments unlawfully impaired those contracts in violation of U.S. Const. Art. I \u00a7 10, cl. 1. and Ky. Const. \u00a7 19. We, accordingly, reverse the Court of Appeals and reinstate the partial summary judgment awarded to Maze by the Franklin Circuit Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Minton, C.J.; Hughes, Keller, VanMeter, and Wright, JJ., concur. Cunningham, J., not sitting.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    The Complaint and Petition for Declaratory Judgment listed as additional plaintiffs, \"Unknown Similarly Situated Purchasers of KAPT Contracts.\" The Motion for Discretionary Review identified same as Appellants. This provision in Maze's complaint seemingly implicates our class-action litigation rules, CR 23. Appellees did not object to Maze's assertion of claims for unknown KAPT participants. The supposed class-action nature of the lawsuit is not an issue before us.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    KAPT's informational material stated that fund balances could also be used to attend private and out-of-state universities, and that any unused funds would be refunded to the contract participant. And so, the benefits of KAPT are not limited to Kentucky's public universities.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    The unused prepaid tuition would not be forfeited; the participant could withdraw the balance of funds not used within the utilization period.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    See note 1.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-112\">\n    In effect, participants could potentially abuse the plan by holding onto the account instead of using the money as tuitions rise, to attain what amounts to a risk-free rate of return indexed to rising tuition costs. There is no allegation that Maze has done so, or that she has acted with anything but the utmost good faith. This decision does not extend to such circumstances. Plan participants have a duty of good faith and fair dealing in utilizing their KAPT contracts, and those that exploit the contracts to achieve risk-free high rates of return with no intention of using the funds for educational purpose are in violation of the contract. Our holding here does not foreclose the possibility of redress against such abuse.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
