Sarro, individually and as next friend of Jared Adrian Mata, a minor, sued Appellants Orion Real Estate Services, Inc. (\"Orion\") and Woodhill Public Facility Corp. (\"Woodhill\") alleging their negligence caused Jared injuries when he was bitten by a dog. Appellants filed a plea to the jurisdiction, asserting their immunity from suit. Appellants appeal the trial court's denial of the plea. We affirm in part and dismiss in part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On January 26, 2016, Sarro filed an amended petition bringing claims against Orion, Woodhill, George Phillips, and the San Antonio Housing Authority (\"SAHA\") seeking damages for injuries Jared sustained when he was allegedly bitten by a dog on January 18, 2014 while playing outside in an apartment complex, Woodhill Apartments. Sarro alleged the property is owned by SAHA and Woodhill and managed by Orion, and that the dog was under the care and control of Phillips, a resident of the property. On October 7, 2016, SAHA filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, arguing that as a local government entity, it was immune from suit, and Sarro did not establish the State's consent to\n   waive immunity. On November 3, 2016, the trial court signed an order granting SAHA's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On September 6, 2017, Orion and Woodhill together filed a hybrid plea to the jurisdiction and traditional motion for summary judgment. In the plea to the jurisdiction, Appellants argued they were entitled to governmental immunity from suit and that Sarro had not pleaded any \"specific legislative grant of permission to sue [Appellants, or any] conduct by [Appellants] to which a waiver of immunity from suit might apply.\" On October 5, 2017, the trial court signed an order denying Appellants' hybrid plea to the jurisdiction and traditional motion for summary judgment.

Although the legislature allows PFCs such as Woodhill to \"acquire, construct, rehabilitate, renovate, repair, equip, furnish, or place in service public facilities\" such as housing projects, Woodhill has presented no evidence that it acted without discretion and at the direction of SAHA regarding the dog's presence on the property or any security systems or procedures in place to protect against dog attacks.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   TEX.
