We have reviewed the briefs of the parties and the record on appeal and we conclude the motion court did not err. An extended opinion would have no precedential value. We have, however, provided a memorandum setting forth the reasons for our decision to the parties for their use\n   only. We affirm the judgment pursuant to Missouri Rule of Civil Procedure 84.16(b).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
