Issue One: Did the trial court err by refusing to award Hersh any trial level attorneys' fees?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    1. The Parties' Contentions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Hersh argues that she is entitled to recover both (i) her trial level attorneys' fees in this case and (ii) the fees she incurred in the prior defamation suit for legal work that was used in this case. She further argues that we should render judgment awarding her the fees she requested rather than remand to the trial court because her fee evidence was clear, direct, positive, uncontroverted, unimpeached, and not discredited.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In their original cross-appellees' brief, the Tatums responded (i) an attorneys' fee award is not mandatory under Chapter 27; (ii) Hersh could not recover any fees from the defamation lawsuit; and (iii) even if a fee award is mandatory under Chapter 27, the trial court's award of conditional appellate fees only was not an abuse of discretion. In their supplemental brief on remand, the Tatums also argue (iv) a fee award would violate their due process rights because they did not have fair notice that Chapter 27 could be construed the way the supreme court construed it and (v) alternatively, the issue should be remanded to the trial court for a reasonableness determination.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Hersh responds that the Tatums' due process argument is incorrect, untimely, and exceeds the supreme court's mandate's scope. Hersh also argues that the Tatums did not challenge the reasonableness of Hersh's fees in the trial court, so we should not remand to give them \"a second bite at the apple.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   <strong>\n    2.

Did the trial court have discretion to award Hersh no trial level attorneys' fees?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   After our decision in this case, the supreme court held that Chapter 27 requires an award of reasonable attorneys' fees to a successful movant.\n   <em>\n    Sullivan v. Abraham\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6802377\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/488/294/#p299\">\n    488 S.W.3d 294\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 299 (Tex. 2016) ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   CIV. PRAC. \u00a7 27.009(a)(1). The trial court has discretion in determining the award's amount, \"but that discretion, under [Chapter 27], does not also specifically include considerations of justice and equity.\"\n   <em>\n    Sullivan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6802377\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/488/294/#p299\">\n    488 S.W.3d at 299\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Here, Hersh submitted affidavit evidence to prove up her reasonable attorneys' fees up to the date of the last hearing. Following\n   <em>\n    Sullivan\n   </em>\n   , we conclude that\n   the trial court abused its discretion by awarding Hersh no trial level attorneys' fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Would awarding Hersh her trial level attorneys' fees violate the Tatums' due process rights?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Next, the Tatums argue that a fee award would violate their due process rights because Chapter 27 did not give them fair notice that they could be required to pay Hersh's fees even though Hersh denied making the alleged communication giving rise to the Tatums' claims. This argument requires us to address threshold questions about the supreme court's mandate and error preservation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    (1) The Mandate\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   We first conclude that the Tatums' due process argument is within the supreme court's mandate's scope.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \"We have no authority to take any action to address issues other than those we are required to address pursuant to the mandate.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Davis\n   </em>\n   , No. 05-15-00888-CV,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2015%20WL%204572660\">\n    2015 WL 4572660\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *2 (Tex. App.-Dallas July 30, 2015, orig. proceeding) (mem. op.). Here, the supreme court's mandate remanded the case to us \"for further proceedings in accordance with [the supreme court's] opinion.\" The opinion, in turn, directed us \"to consider whether the trial court erred by refusing [Hersh] her attorneys' fees and sanctions and for any other proceedings.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12407910\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/526/462/#p466\">\n    526 S.W.3d at 468\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The Tatums' argument can be construed as arguing that the trial court did not err by denying Hersh her trial level attorneys' fees because awarding those fees would have violated the Tatums' due process rights. Thus construed, the argument is within the supreme court's mandate, and we can consider it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    (2) Error Preservation\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The next question is whether the Tatums' failure to raise this due process argument in the trial court forfeited it. They argue that the argument is timely because it ripened only after the supreme court issued its opinion holding that Chapter 27 applies despite Hersh's denial that she made the alleged communication. And they argue that parties should not be required to preemptively assert a due process \"fair notice\" argument in every case just in case an appellate court unexpectedly interprets the law in an unforeseeable way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   We are not persuaded by the Tatums' argument. Hersh requested her fees by requesting \u00a7 27.009 relief in her dismissal motion. The Tatums opposed the motion, in part, by arguing that Hersh denied making the alleged communication.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6785127\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/493/675/#p683\">\n    493 S.W.3d at 679\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Their due process argument is essentially that they could not reasonably foresee that a court would interpret Chapter 27 to allow a defendant to invoke its protections while simultaneously denying making the communication. But Hersh asked the trial court to interpret the statute that way by making her dismissal motion. The Tatums could have asserted their due process argument then.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Without a proper pleading raising unconstitutionality, \"the trial court is generally without authority to reach the issue.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Doe 2\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9130217\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/19/278/#p284\">\n    19 S.W.3d 278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 284 (Tex. 2000). Thus, the trial court could not properly deny Hersh her trial level attorneys' fees based on a due process complaint the Tatums had not raised. Moreover, we will not affirm an order based on a legal theory that was not presented to the trial court and to which the opposing party had no opportunity to respond.\n   <em>\n    Victoria Gardens of Frisco v. Walrath\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8180153\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/257/284/#p290\">\n    257 S.W.3d 284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 290 (Tex. App.-Dallas 2008, pet. denied).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Accordingly, we do not consider the Tatums' due process argument.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   <strong>\n    c. Should we render judgment or remand?\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The two remaining arguments concern the amount of fees to be awarded. First, the parties dispute whether Hersh can recover fees she incurred defending the Tatums' prior defamation suit based on her lawyer's affidavit testimony that those particular fees \"would necessarily have been incurred in the Second Lawsuit had the First Lawsuit never been filed\" and \"represent[ ] work that was used in connection with the Second Lawsuit.\" Second, the parties dispute whether we should render judgment on attorneys' fees or remand for further proceedings in the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   We address the second question first. Appellate courts generally remand the fee issue when a trial court has erroneously denied a Chapter 27 dismissal motion.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Cox Media Grp., LLC v.

But Hersh cites no evidence that the Tatums have ever filed a lawsuit that did not arise from the facts underlying this case, much less an unrelated lawsuit implicating a defendant's exercise of the right of association, petition, or speech. The trial court reasonably could have concluded that the evidence showed only that (i) the Tatums were highly motivated to seek redress for the specific newspaper column that, in their view, attacked their son's obituary and their honesty, (ii) the tragedy of losing their son and the obituary underlying the suit would not repeat, and (iii) the Tatums showed no inclination to file future lawsuits within Chapter 27's purview.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   We conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by implicitly finding that no deterrence was necessary.

We otherwise affirm the trial court's judgment. We remand the case for a determination and award of Hersh's reasonable attorneys' fees, excluding the already-awarded conditional appellate attorneys' fees that no party challenged on appeal.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   n.1.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    No party has complained, at any stage of this appeal, about the trial court's award of conditional appellate attorneys' fees against the Tatums.
