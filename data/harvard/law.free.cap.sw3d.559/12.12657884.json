Fields raises two points on appeal: (1) Fields claims he is entitled to parole as a result of a 2017 amendment to \u00a7 565.024 that removed language mandating that a person convicted serve at least 85% of the sentence imposed before becoming eligible for parole; and (2) Fields is not otherwise required to serve a minimum of 85% of his sentence under \u00a7 558.019.3 because he is not a \"dangerous offender.\" Because Fields's claim is barred by \u00a7 1.160, the trial court did not err in granting the Board's motion for judgment on the pleadings. Its judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On December 30, 2012, Fields was involved in a vehicular crash wherein an occupant of the car Fields struck was killed. Fields was charged with first-degree involuntary manslaughter in violation of \u00a7 565.024.1(3)(a),\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   leaving the scene of a motor vehicle accident in violation of \u00a7 577.060.1, and driving while intoxicated in violation of \u00a7 577.010. On March 21, 2014, Fields entered an\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   plea\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   pursuant to a plea agreement with the State wherein the State agreed to dismiss Counts II and III and recommend a sentence of nine years for involuntary manslaughter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At the time of Fields's offense, \u00a7 565.024.1(3)(a) provided,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   A person commits the crime of involuntary manslaughter in the first degree if he ... [w]hile in an intoxicated condition operates a motor vehicle ... in this state, and, when so operating, acts with criminal negligence to ... [c]ause the death of any person not a passenger in the vehicle ... operated by the defendant.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \u00a7 565.024.1(3)(a). The statute further provided that \"[i]nvoluntary manslaughter in the first degree under subdivision (3) of subsection 1 of this section is a class B felony,\" and \"[f]or any violation of subdivision (3) of subsection 1 of this section, the minimum prison term which the defendant must serve shall be eighty-five percent of his ... sentence.\" \u00a7 565.024.2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On May 13, 2014, Senate Bill 491, which revised Missouri's Criminal Code effective January 1, 2017, became law by virtue of the Missouri Constitution, Article III, \u00a7 31.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Section 565.024 was among the sections repealed and replaced by Senate Bill 491. The revised version of \u00a7 565.024 provided: \"A person commits the offense of involuntary manslaughter in the first degree if he or she recklessly causes the death of another person.\" \u00a7 565.024.1, RSMo Supp. 2017. It further provided that \"[t]he offense of involuntary manslaughter in the first degree is a class C felony.\" \u00a7 565.024.2, RSMo Supp. 2017. The subsection mandating a minimum prison term of 85% of the defendant's sentence was deleted in the revised version.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On May 16, 2014, Fields received a notice from the Board stating, \"You have\n   been sentenced to nine (9) years for A[lford] P[lea]: Involuntary Manslaughter First-Veh Intoxication. In accordance with section 565.024 RSMo, you are not eligible for release until serving 85% of your sentence.

On October 17, 2017, Fields filed a petition for declaratory judgment challenging the Board's determination that Fields was required to serve 85% of his sentence before becoming parole eligible. Fields argued that the revised version of \u00a7 565.024, which no longer contained a mandatory minimum prison term, should be applied retroactively to his sentence and, as a result, he should not be required to serve a mandatory minimum of 85% of his nine-year sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After filing an answer denying that Fields was entitled to a declaratory judgment, the Board filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that \u00a7 1.160 required Fields's punishment to be determined by the version of \u00a7 565.024 in effect at the time of his offense.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Alternatively, the Board argued that, even under the 2017 revisions, Fields was still required to serve 85% of his sentence because his offense constituted a \"dangerous felony\" under \u00a7 556.061(19).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On February 26, 2018, the court granted the Board's motion, determining that \"\u00a7 1.160 requires that Fields'[s] punishment [be] determined by the law in effect at the time of the crime.\" The court further determined that, even under the current statutes, Fields would have to serve 85% because his offense qualified as a \"dangerous felony.\" Fields appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"The appellate court reviews the trial court's grant of a motion to dismiss or a motion for judgment on the pleadings\n   <em>\n    de novo.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Barrett v.

In his first point, he challenges the trial court's determination that \u00a7 1.160 precludes any retroactive application of the current version of \u00a7 565.024. In his second point, he challenges the trial court's determination that his offense constitutes a \"dangerous felony,\" subjecting him to an 85% mandatory minimum under the current laws, regardless of the changes to \u00a7 565.024. The Board concedes that Fields's second point is meritorious and that the trial court's determination that Fields's offense constituted a \"dangerous\n   felony\" is legally erroneous. The Board argues, however, that the trial court's application of \u00a7 1.160 was correct and, therefore, its judgment should be affirmed. In light of the Board's concession of error on Fields's second point, we need not address it and, instead, focus solely on whether \u00a7 1.160 precludes Fields's requested relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   At the time of Fields's offense, first-degree involuntary manslaughter under \u00a7 565.024 could be committed in no fewer than seven different ways.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The manner of the offense to which Fields pled guilty is found in \u00a7 565.024.1(3)(a). Under that subdivision, a person commits first-degree involuntary manslaughter if,\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   [w]hile in an intoxicated condition[, he] operates a motor vehicle ... in this state, and, when so operating, acts with criminal negligence to ... [c]ause the death of any person not a passenger in the vehicle ... operated by the defendant, including the death of an individual that results from the defendant's vehicle leaving a highway, as defined by section 301.010, or the highway's right-of-way.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \u00a7 565.024.1(3)(a). Subsection 2 of \u00a7 565.024 identified the various classifications of first-degree involuntary manslaughter, depending upon the manner of commission. \u00a7 565.024.2, RSMo 2008. Section 565.024.2 provided that Fields's manner of commission constituted a class B felony and that \"the minimum prison term which the defendant must serve shall be eighty-five percent of his ... sentence.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12655973\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/542/370/#p375\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Neither of these provisions applied to other manners of committing first-degree involuntary manslaughter. Subsection 2 also provided an enhanced penalty for a person convicted multiple times under subdivision (3), raising the offense to a class A felony upon a second or subsequent violation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12655973\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/542/370/#p375\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   When Senate Bill 491 repealed \u00a7 565.024, it replaced it with a new \u00a7 565.024, and the new statute was considerably less detailed. The revised version of \u00a7 565.024 provided: \"A person commits the offense of involuntary manslaughter in the first degree if he or she recklessly causes the death of another person.\" \u00a7 565.024.1, RSMo Supp. 2017. Subsection 2 was also greatly abbreviated, providing only that \"[t]he offense of involuntary manslaughter in the first degree is a class C felony.\" \u00a7 565.024.2, RSMo Supp. 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Because the revised version of \u00a7 565.024.2 no longer required a defendant to serve a mandatory minimum of 85% of his sentence before becoming parole eligible, Fields sought to retroactively apply only this aspect of the new statute to his sentence. In doing so, however, Fields did not address the facts that the new statute not only carried a higher culpable mental element (recklessness instead of criminal negligence) but also used a lower classification of the offense (class C felony instead of class B). He further failed to acknowledge the vastly different elements of the crime under the 2008 version and the 2017 version. It is unclear under what authority Fields believes the lower court could have selectively applied only part of the new statute retroactively without consideration for the others. Courts must \"read[ ] the statutes ... in their entirety rather than piecemeal.\"\n   <em>\n    Vill. N., Inc. v.
