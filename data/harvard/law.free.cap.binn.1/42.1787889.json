Ross </em>for the defendants</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AjM\">answered that there had been several meetings during the life time of <em>Dunwoody, </em>and therefore the plaintiff had already derived the advantages which he contemplated in agreeing to the rule: that it was a general practice of this court to refuse to rescind a rule of reference after there had been a meeting of the parties; and that as the administrators had come in voluntarily without asking any favour, there was no equity in granting one to the plaintiff; though the act <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>cited appeared to regard no other privilege to the defendants than that of a continuance.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b55-5\">Per Curiam.</author>\n<p id=\"A2rx\">Rules of reference should not lightly be struck off, after a party has felt the pulse of the referees at a meeting, and concessions have heen-jnade which cannot be afterwards used. Upon the circumstances of this case we must continue the rule of reference. <footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b55-6\"><em> Vid.
