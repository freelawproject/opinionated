John Snyder the lessor of the plaintiff obtained a judgment against Peter Hofman in this court at September term 1798 for 305 dolls, and 58 cts. and costs; and by a ft. fa. he took in execution the premises in question. The inquest found that the rents and profits would pay in seven years; and a l~be~ ran facias was then issued, and a return made that the house and lot were delivered at a certain valuation to Snyder; At the time of this execution Eleanor ETofinan the defendant, who was the wife of Peter but had separated from him, claimed and was possessed of the property under a conveyance from Peter to one Hannah Toy;, but this conveyance was alleged to have been without consideration and with intent to defraud Snyder; and he therefore brought the present ejectment.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b55-13\">The matters in variance in this cause were referred under a rule of court; and the referees made the following report: \"We \"the referees &amp;c. do award. a balance of 364 dolls, and 37 cts. \"~due from Peter Hoffman the defendant to John Snyder plain\"tiff, with costs of suits It is in f~i1l proof before the referees \"that the said Peter Hoffman and Eleanor his wife conveyed \"a certain house and lot in the district of Southwark unto Han'. \"nah Toy in fee, without any valuable consideration; which \"said house and lot were reconveyed by the said H~innah Toy \"to Eleanor wife of the said Peter Hoffman without any con\"sideration as appears to us, thereby intending to prevent the \"said house and lot being levied on for the payment of the just <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>\u201c debts of the said <em>Peter Hoffman, </em>which in equity <em>we believe \u201c s^ou^ mac^e liable </em>to the judgment that <em>may be </em>obtained by \u201c the said <em>John Snyder on this award.\u201d</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AuC\">To this report several exceptions were filed. 1. That the jla(j \u00bf[eciqeci on a matter not submitted to them; viz. the sum due from <em>Peter Hoffman </em>to <em>Snyder. 2. </em>That the award was not positive, as the referees merely say <em>they believe </em>that the premises <em>should in equity be made liable </em>to the judgment that <em>may be </em>obtained. 3. That the referees report that the premises shculdbe liable to the judgment obtained on <em>this award; </em>whereas the question was whether they were liable to a judgment obtained in another suit. 4. That the sum awarded to be due was not the same that was recovered in the suit between <em>Snyder </em>mid <em>Peter Hoffman.</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b56-7\"><em>Hopkinson </em>in support of the exceptions,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9G9\">after opening the case, was stopped by the court, who desired to hear the opposite counsel.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b56-8\"><em>Raxvle </em>in support of the award.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AYYY\">All the exceptions, but that which relates to the sum awarded, turn upon informality; and as to that exception, the referees have merely added interest to the original judgment; at all events there is no doubt an award may be good in part and bad as to the rest. This court has been astute to support awards where justice has been done, and the real question between the parties decided. They have <em>gone even in </em>the case of verdicts as far as is necessary here, by moulding an informal verdict so as to produce consistency on the record. <em>Walker </em>v. Gibbs, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> Thompson v. Musser </em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em>. </em>The report is in effect a general finding for the plaintiff. For the only question between the parties was whether the premises in controversy were liable in equity to <em>Snyder's </em>judgment against Hoffman, and this the referees have substantially said, although they may have added immaterial matter.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b56-9\"><em>Candy </em>in reply.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Arhu\">There is evidently something more than informality upon the very face of the award. The referees do not find the house and lot of which they speak, to be the same for which the ejectment is brought; they award that the deed <em>by </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number><em>Hannah Toy </em>was intended to defraud, ancl not that <em>to </em>her; they report their <em>belief, </em>instead of saying that the fact is or is not so; and instead of awarding that the premises <em>are </em>liable, which is the very question in dispute, they express an opinion that in equity they ought to be so. Further, it surely is no informality to award a sum to be due by <em>Peter Hoffman the </em>defendant, when he is no party to the suit, when that question was never submitted to the referees, and when it is confessed to be a different sum from that which <em>Snyder </em>actually recovered from <em>Hoffman </em>in a suit at law. This part of the report exposes the premises to two debts, or certainly to a larger one than was due.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b57-4\"><em>The </em>Court,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A9y\">after the argument, being of opinion that the report was merely informal, recommitted it to the same referees to correct the informality; who on the next day reported generally that they found for the plaintiff with six pence damages.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b57-5\"><em>Condy </em>and <em>Hopkinson</em></attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Apa\">now objected to filing the second report, as the court had no authority to recommit without consent of parties.
