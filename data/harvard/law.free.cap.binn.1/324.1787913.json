The purchase' was accordingly made, and six of the warrantees conveyed to <em>Hunter. </em>The land fell within the seventeen townships. All the parties released to the Commonwealth under the act of 4th <em>April 1799, </em>but the commissioners awarded the valuation to <em>Moore </em>alone, no part of the purchase money having been repaid to him. <em>Hunter </em>and <em>M'Cord\u2019s </em>representatives entered a <em>caveat </em>in the land office against issuing a ticket to the Comptroller and Register General in <em>Moore\u2019s </em>favour, and they were heard by the board of property upon the question of their right to a part of the valuation; but the <em>caveat </em>was dismissed. The board however withheld the ticket in conformity to the third section of the law above mentioned, which amono: other things provides, that \u201c In case of disputes between <em>Pennsylvania </em>claimants before \u201c the issuing of the certificates in pursuance of this act, such \u201c disputes shall be decided by the board of property according. \u201c to the <em>general usage; </em>provided that their decision shall not \u201c prevent the party against whom it is made, from prosecuting \u201c his claim in the courts of law <em>as usual; </em>and in case of an <em>ap- </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>\u201c <em>peal </em>from the decision of the board of property, the certifi- \u201c cates <em>shall not issue until the dispute is </em>decided.\u201d 4 <em>St. Laws' </em>400. <em>Hunter </em>and <em>MiC&lt;ord appealed </em>from the decision of the board of property to the Common Pleas of <em>Lancaster </em>county, and the appeal was afterwards removed to the Circuit Court.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b337-3\">In <em>December 1805 </em>Ingersoll,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AfUj\">upon the affidavit of <em>Moore\u2019s </em>administrator, obtained a rule upon the defendants to shew cause why a <em>mandamus </em>should not issue to them to grant the ticket to him for the whole valuation; and his ground was, that no appeal was authorized by law, although the word <em>appeal </em>was used; but that an action was the only mode of settling the dispute, which the losing party had omitted too long to adopt, now to prevent the board of property from putting the successful party in possession of his rights.</p>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b337-4\">The propriety of the <em>appeal </em>and also of the mandamus, were by consent blended in argument at the present term by <em>Ingersoll </em>for Moore, and by <em>Tilghman </em>for <em>Hunter </em>and <em>MHord; </em>and the judges now delivered their opinions upon both questions.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b337-5\">Tilghman C.

The third section of this law enacts, that in case of disputes between the <em>Pennsylvania </em>claimants, (before the issuing of the certificates in pursuance of the act) such disputes shall be decided by the board of property according to the <em>general usage; </em>provided that their decision shall not prevent the party against whom it is made, from prosecuting his claim in the courts of law as usual, and in case of an appeal from the decision, the certificates shall not issue till the dispute shall be decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">There was a dispute before the board of property, between <em>Alexander Hunter </em>and the representatives of <em>William MCord </em>deceased plaintiffs, and the administrator of <em>James Moore </em>defendant. The board decided in favour of the defendant, and dismissed the <em>caveat </em>of the plaintiffs. The party against whom the decision was made, entered an appeal to the Court of- Common Pleas of <em>Lancaster </em>county, which was removed to the Circuit Court of the same county. On the other hand, the administrator of <em>Moore </em>has applied to this court for a mandamus, to compel the officers of the land office to issue a ticket to him, by which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>be may be enabled to receive from the Commonwealth the wb\u00b0^e money at which the land was valued. We are now to decide on the appeal and the <em>mandamus. </em>I think it very clear that the appeal must be dismissed; there is no law or precedent authorizing an appeal from the board of property to the Court of Common Pleas of any county. The only mode of appeal is by bringing an action at law. But in the present case there is great difficulty in bringing an action. The party against whom the board of property decided, cannot bring an ejectment, because he has released his title to the Commonwealth. Neither can he bring an action for money received by his adversary for his use, because no money has yet been received. Under these circumstances I do not think it right to issue a <em>mandamus. </em>The appeal being dismissed, the board of property are at liberty to act according to their discretion. And I should think it no abuse of that discretion, if they were to say, that inasmuch as it was the clear intent of the legislature that <em>no money should be </em>paid, till the party against whom they decided had an opportunity of a trial in nature of an appeal, and as such trial cannot be had unless the parties by mutual consent agree upon some mode of bringing the matter before a court of law, they will withhold the ticket until the administrator of <em>James Moore </em>consents to put the matter in train for a speedy decision. If after this intimation, any affectation of delay should be manifested by the party against whom the board have decided, a ticket might be issued to <em>Moore </em>immediately.</p>\n<author id=\"b338-4\">Yeates J.</author>\n<p id=\"AGe\">The proviso in the third section of the act of 4th <em>April </em>1799 is involved in great obscurity, from its not prescribing the mode of appeal from the decision of the board of property. I am strongly inclined to believe that it must be by action at law. But in what form? The. <em>Pennsylvania </em>claimant must release to the state before he can be entitled to compensation; and when he is divested of his title, he cannot support ejectment. The words are, \u201c the certificates shall not issue un- \u201c til the dispute shall be decided.\u201d Until the money is paid, I do not see what kind of personal action can be maintained.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">The board of property are to decide in case of disputes between <em>Pennsylvania </em>claimants, according to the <em>general usage. </em>They seem to have done so in the present case. The appeal must be dismissed as irregularly made to the Common Pleas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>of <em>Lancaster </em>county. But if <em>Alexander Hunter </em>and <em>John Cook </em>are willing to institute a suit to try their right, I do not see how the certificate can be issued until that matter is settled. It will be found the interest of all parties to agree on some amicable mode of deciding the dispute. The motion for a <em>mandamus </em>as to the ticket must be denied, as it goes to the Comptroller and Register General.</p>\n<judges id=\"b339-9\">Smith J. was not present at the argument.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b339-10\">Buackenuidge J. concurred.</judges>\n<p id=\"b339-11\">Appeal dismissed, and Rule discharged.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
