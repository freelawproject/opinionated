Where the words of a statute are descriptive of the <em>nature </em>of the offence, there it is necessary to specify in the particular words of such statute; <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Pemberton; </em><footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark> and the court will not, by q forced intendment, support an indictment which is defective in the description of the crime, since they are restrained by the same principle which limits the operation of penal statutes in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>cases within their letter. The notes are also laid in this indictment to be <em>of </em>the bank of the <em>United States </em>&amp;c. The effect of' this language in vulgar use is not a question for the court, but on the contrary its legal import; and this evidently is, that the notes were the property of the bank; which leaves it still more doubtful whether they were promissory notes for the payment of money. <em>Craven's </em>case, 2 <em>East Cr. Law </em>601. is in point. He was indicted upon the stat. 2 <em>Geo. </em>2. c. 25. for stealing a certain note <em>commonly called a bank note; </em>and all the Judges on reference to them, hgld the indictment ill, as in describing the property stolen, it did not follow any of the descriptions of property in th% statute.</p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-4\">The indictment states the notes to be of the <em>goods </em>and <em>chattels </em>of <em>Ditffey. </em>In the case of the <em>King </em>v. <em>Sadi </em>and Morris, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>it was determined by all the judges to be improper to lay bank notes to be chattels, though they were also of opinion that that word might be rejected as surplusage, if the indictment were in other respects sufficient. In that case they were laid to be the \u201c <em>property </em>and chattels\u201d of S. S.; but here if \u201c goods and chattels\u201d are rejected, the indictment is gone. There is no accessary after the fact for receiving <em>money; </em>because money is not goods and chattels within the acts which make it felony to receive goods and chattels, knowing them to have been stolen. <em>Guy's </em>case <footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark>, <em>Morris's </em>case <footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark>, <em>Dean's </em>case <footnotemark><em>(d)</em></footnotemark><em>.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b215-5\">For the commonwealth it was said that no other certainty was required in an indictment, than what is called by Lord <em>Coke </em>\u201c certainty to a certain intent <em>in </em>general,\u201d and not in every particular. No other description of the offence is necessary, than such as will inform the defendant what crime he is called'to answer, as will appear to warrant the jury in their conclusion of guilty or not guilty upon the premises delivered to them, and as will so define the crime to the court that they may apply the legal punishment. <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Horn, </em><footnotemark><em>(e)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Can there be a question upon the face of this indictment, what crime the defendant is called to answer? Is not a note of the President directors and company of the bank of the <em>United </em>States, in the strictest sense a note drawn by that incorporation? For if this preposition indi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>cates property in the bank, then the second reason in arrest of \u201cjudgment must fail upon the defendant\u2019s own argument, since, the words \u201c of the goods and chattels\u201d may be stri\u00e1ken out as surplusage; and then the articles stolen will be notes \u201c <em>of </em>the \u201c said <em>John D'ffeyP </em>It is the same as if they were laid to be notes drawn by the company, which must necessarily be intended to be promissory notes for the payment of the money mentioned. If they had been paid and cancelled this might have been shewn under the defendant\u2019s plea. The contrary 'reason has too much subtility in it for justice. It leaves nothing,to the discretion of the judges, who although they \u201c will not suffer a man to be \u201c condemned of any crime whereof the jury have n\u00bft expressly \u201c found him guilty, by any argument or implication from what \u201c they have so found, so on the other hand they will not suffer \u201c a criminal to escape for so trifling an exception, which it would u be absurd and ridiculous to take notice of; for <em>nimia subtilitas </em>\u201c <em>in Jure </em>reprobatur.\u201d 2 <em>Hawk. c. </em>25. <em>s. </em>61. <em>Craven\u2019s </em>case turned upon its being laid to be a note <em>commonly called </em>a bank note; for if those words had been omitted, the other words would have come expressly within one of the descriptions in 2 <em>Geo. </em>2.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b216-9\">That promissory notes are goods and chattels can hardly be questioned; for although bank notes which are paid and received as cash, may pass under the description of money, yet they are legally nothing more than choses in action, and are ranked under the head of chattels personal by all the elementary writers. 2 <em>Bl.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"Abx\">The prisoner was indicted for the robbery' of <em>John Duffey </em>in a certain lane near the highway, of the following property viz. \u201c T wo ten dollar notes of the President \u201c directors and company of the bank of the <em>United States; </em>one \u201c ten dollar note of the President directors and company of the u bank of <em>North America; </em>one five dollar note of the President \u201c directors and company of the bank of Pennsylvania; and one \u201c three dollar note of the <em>Philadelphia </em>bank; being altogether \u201c of the value of thirty eight dollars of the <em>goods </em>and <em>chattels </em>of \u201c the said <em>John </em>Duffey.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b216-11\">On the trial of this indictment, the jury acquitted the prisoner of the robbery, and found him guilty of <em>larceny. </em>His counsel have offered two reasons in arrest of judgment, 1st. That the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>Indictment does not pursue the act of Assembly, by which the property alleged to have been stolen was made the subject robbery or larceny. 2d. That the indictment lays the property to foe the goods and chattels of <em>Duffey.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">It is admitted that bank notes were not the subject of larceny at common law. Burthe' present question depends upon the act of Assembfy of 5th April, 1790, <em>sec. </em>5. by which it is enacted, \u201c that robbeiy or larceny <em>o\u00ed promissory notes for the payment of </em>\u201c money, shall he punished in the same manner as robbery or \u201c larceny of <em>any goods or chattels</em></p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">The punishment of robbery and larceny being severe and ignominious, we must confine ourselves to those strict rules of construction, which have always prevailed in the consideration of indictments on highly penal statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-9\">The subject is not altogether new. Decisions have taken place in <em>England </em>on a statute similar to our act of Assembly; I mean the statute of 2 <em>Geo. </em>2. c. 25. <em>s. </em>3. by which, among many other things, <em>bank </em>notes, and notes <em>for the payment of </em>money, are made subjects of felony. In the case of the <em>King </em>v. <em>Craven, </em>who was indicted on this statute for stealing \u201c <em>a certain </em>note, u <em>cor, ' nly culled a bank note, </em>of the value of one pound, \u201c marked &amp;c, dated &amp;c. and signed by <em>A. Hooper, </em>for the \u201c Governor and Company of the bank of <em>England, </em>by which said \u201c note, said <em>Hooper, </em>for said governor See. did promise to pa}' \u201c to <em>Abraham Newland, </em>or bearer on demand, the sum of one \u201c pound, the said note being the property of one <em>T. G. </em>&amp;c.,\u201d after conviction, <em>all the judges, </em>on reference to them in <em>March </em>1801, held the indictment ill laid, as in describing the property stolen to be a note, commonly <em>called a bank </em>note, it did not follow any of the descriptions of property in the statute, and in <em>other respects </em>seemed inaccurate. What those <em>other respects </em>were, is not mentioned. But from what is mentioned, we see the very strict construction supported by tbe <em>English </em>judges. One of the descriptions in the statute is, <em>notes for the payment of money. </em>Our act of Assembly says, <em>promissory notes for the payment of money. </em>The indictment should either aver in the words of the act of Assembly, that the notes stolen were <em>promissory notes for the payment of </em>money, or give such a description as proves them incontestably to have been promissory notes for the payment of money, without conjecture, or reference to facts not stated in the indictment. Jn the case before us, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>indictment charges the notes to be \u201c two ten .dollar notes <em>of </em>the \u201c\u201c President directors and company of the bank of the <em>United \u201c </em>States,\u201d and so of the rest. Now though I am satisfied from having often seen notes of these banks, that they must have been promissory notes for the payment of money, yet I cannot say that this positively appears on the face of the indictment. A note <em>of </em>a bank is a general expression, by no means positively importing that it is a note by which that bank promised to pay money.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">It appears upon search that the precedents of indictments on this act of Assembly, have not been uniform. In the if ase of the <em>Commonxvealth </em>v. <em>Dolan and </em>Donelly, in the Mayor\u2019s Court <em>October </em>sessions 1801, the exception now urged, was taken to the indictment. No judgment was given, because the defendants absconded; but since that time it has been usual to frame the indictments so as to avoid the exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-10\">Upon the whole, I am of opinion that this exception is good. The judgment must therefore be arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-11\">It is unnecessary to give any opinion on the <em>second </em>point;, although I would by no means have it understood, that I think the indictment bad because the notes are laid to be the <em>goods </em>and <em>chattels </em>of <em>John Dujfey. </em>Yet I certainly consider it as more correct to lay them to be the <em>property </em>of the person from whom they are stolen, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<author id=\"b218-12\">Smith J.</author>\n<p id=\"AUQ\">Two reasons have been filed in arrest of judgment; if either of them be valid, the judgment must be arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-13\">Whether the great strictness in favour of life, which has at. all times been required in England., in every point of indictments in capital cases, ought to extend to indictments for offences formerly capital in Pennsylvania, but now subject only to imprisonment at hard labour, and a certain proportion of the time to confinement in the solitary cells, will deserve great consideration when the point comes directly before the court. For the humane judge <em>Hale </em>complains, and the complaint has been a thousand times repeated since his time, \u201c that \u201c this strictness has grown to be a blemish and inconvenience \u201c in the administration of the law; for that more offenders \u201c escape by the over easy ear given to exceptions in indict- \u201c ments, than by their own innocence; and many times gross <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>ts murders, burglaries, robberies, and other heinous and crying \u201c offences, remain unpunished by these unseemly niceties; to \u201c the reproach of the law, to the shame of government, to the \u201c encouragement of villany, and to the dishonour of God.\u201d 2 <em>Hale </em>193. So far as these unseemly niceties have prevailed in capital cases decided before the revolution, we are fettered by them. We are not at liberty to overrule an exception which has prevailed before in a case exactly in point, although every judge and every well read lawyer who hears it, may be convinced it has no foundation in the merits of the particular case, or in the general principles of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-6\">However, great as this evil undoubtedly is, it is perhaps better that it should be submitted to, than that the opposite evil should creep into its place. Should courts launch into a sea of \u25a0Uncertainty, having no land marks to guide them, the innocent, not knowing under a vague charge in the indictment what they are really to answer, may suffer; and I do not know that the guilty will have a less chance of escape than they have under the present strictness. This consideration will make us \u201c rather \u201c bear those ills we have, than fly to others that we know not of.\u201d Where courts are not bound by established precedents or by adjudged cases in point, they are at liberty to exercise a sound legal discretion, in adjudging whether judgment in a criminal or in a civil case shall be arrested.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-8\">I will now consider the two reasons filed in arrest of judgment, in their order.</p>\n<p id=\"ANE\">1. It is generally a good rule in indictments at common law, that the special manner of the whole fact be set forth with such certainty, as that the party may know with what offence he is charged, and thereby be enabled to prepare for and instruct his counsel in his defence; that those words of art, which the law hath appropriated for the description of the offence, must be inserted in the indictment, and cannot be supplied by any other words. 2 <em>Hawk. </em>224, 5. The same rules which are laid down in the books, respecting indictments at common law, are gene, rally applicable to indictments on statutes. 2 <em>Hawk. </em>245. There is no necessity in any indictment grounded on a statute, to recite that statute. But unless it be recited, neither the words <em>contra for mam-statuti, </em>nor any periphrasis, intendment, or conclusion, will make good an indictment which does not bring the fact prohibited or commanded, in the doing or not doing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>whereof the offence consists, <em>within all the material words the statute. Idem </em>249. Indeed, besides pursuity the very words of the statute, it is sometimes necessary to add other words to state the fact fully, directly, and expressly; as indictments for perjury on the statute of <em>5 </em>Eliz., and for usury &amp;c.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">Now what are the material words relating to this point in the act <em>creating </em>the crimes, or to speak more correctly, making promissory notes for the payment of money the subject 'matter of robbery and larceny, for which the defendant has been indicted, and of one of which crimes he has been found guilty by the traverse jury? They are contained in the 5th section of the act of 5th <em>April </em>1790. The only words in this section descriptive of bank notes, are <em>promissory notes for the payment ofmoney; </em>but such words are not stated in the indictment in question as descriptive of the bank notes, for the robbery and larceny of which the defendant has been indicted, and for the larceny of which he has been found guilty. The, words in the indictment describing the bank notes are \u201c Two ten dollar notes of the \u201c President directors and company of the bank of the <em>United </em>States\u201d &amp;c. Now these not being the material words in the act of Assembly, making bank notes the subject matter of robbery and larceny, they not being so at common law, and this indictment being grounded on the act of Assembly, it cannot be supported; this exception is valid, and judgment must be arrested. However, it does not generally follow that because judgment is arrested, the party escapes punishment if guilty. The attorney general may move the court to have him bound over to answer' to another indictment, and he cannot avail himself of judgment being arrested for a mistake in the indictment. He must answer to another indictment properly describing the offence with which he is charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">2. I have my notes before me on which I had formed my opinion on the second exception; but it is not now necessary to give that opinion. I will only say, that on a consideration of all the cases, I am by no means prepared to say that laying the bank notes to be the goods and chattels of <em>Duffey </em>would vitiate the indictment, were they otherwise technically described. However, perhaps it will be \u00e1dvisable in future to lay them as the <em>property </em>of the owner.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">Judgment arrested.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b218-14\"> <em>Vid. </em>1 <em>Dyer 5 b</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
