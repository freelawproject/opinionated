In this attachment no declaration was filed, and judgment was rendered in the following On the 18th of September in the same year Urich paid Kelly nearly the whole amount attached. A scire facias to August terixi 1791 then issued against the ~arnishee~ upon which judgment was rendered in November, with a stay of execution' during six weeks; after the expiration of which time1 but without execution, the residue of the bond was paid by Urich. No security however was found according to the act of Assembly, 1 St. Laws 60. to answer to Myers if within a year \u2022~nd a day he should disprove or avoid the debt &amp;c. &amp;c.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b37-6\">The plaintiff <em>Myers </em>proved a good defence to the demand of ' <em>Kelly; </em>and it appeared to the jury that by articles of agreement between <em>Myers </em>and <em>Kelly, Kelly </em>had covenanted to pay to the very bond upon which he as assignee had brought the foreign.attachment. .A verdict was accordingly taken for the plaintiff subject to the opinion of the court in bank, whether such a payment as <em>Urich </em>had proved was a good defence to the demand of <em>Myers.</em></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b37-7\"><em>Duncan </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A3m\">The precipitate and voluntary by <em>Urich </em>before execution, or scire facias, or the security being entered, was made in his own wrong. the proceedings were regular the garnishee could not have been compelled to pay; and not being compelled to pay, this must assume the character of any other voluntary payment to a third person If we adopted special pleading in its rigour, the. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>defendant would be forced to set out all the proceedings in the attachment, <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Hill </em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em>; </em>that the act had been strictly pursued, <em>Scarpe </em>v. <em>Young </em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em>; </em>that pledges had been, found, 1 <em>Brownl. </em>62. <em>Dyer </em>196. <em>pl. </em>42.; and that execution had issued upon the judgment, <em>Spink </em>v. <em>Tenant </em><footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark>. If this plea were effectually traversed, the garnishee would be compelled to pay the money over again; and he is bound to the same proofs under his plea of payment that would be required under the special plea. It is essential that the payment should be drawn from the garnishee by execution alone; for from the time of the execution the year and day runs, <em>Lewkner </em>v. <em>Huntley </em><footnotemark><em>(d)</em></footnotemark><em>; </em>and if the money be paid before, by so much is the period abridged within which the defendant may resort to the pledges. The law is with Myers, because <em>Urich </em>has no legal defence unless he was compelled by due process of law to pay <em>Kelly; </em>the equity is also with him, because <em>Myers </em>owed nothing to Kelly, <em>Kelly </em>was trusted by Urich, and <em>Urich </em>should support the injury of his own act.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b38-8\">\n<em>Ingersoll</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A6Za\">who was to have argued for the defendant gave up the cause; and</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b38-11\"> 3 <em>Keb. </em>627.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"ASP\"> <em>JLutvi. </em>985.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"(c)\">\n<p id=\"b38-12\"> 1 <em>Roll.
