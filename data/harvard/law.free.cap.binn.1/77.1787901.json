That upon making the inquiry of the 44 said mayor, he declined to give the information desired. 44 That on <em>Monday </em>the 7th day of the said month of November, 44 the deponent, in company with a great number of the said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>\u201c aldermen and justices, to wit, (six aldermen and eight jus- \u201c tices) waited upon the said mayor at his office, a few minutes \u201c after nine o\u2019clock in the morning, it being the day appointed \u201c by law for holding the said election of inspectors of the \u201c prison, and inquired of the said mayor to be informed of the \u201c time and place of holding the said election, as this deponent \u201c together with the said aldermen and justices wished to iC participate in the choice of the said inspectors.

This provision is repeated in a supplement to the <em>Penal Laws </em>of this-state passed 23d <em>September </em>1791. 3 <em>St. Laws </em>124.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b91-8\">The rule was returnable on <em>Monday </em>the 19th inst. when <em>Dickerson </em>on behalf of the defendants appeared to shew cause; <em>Hopkinson </em>and <em>Lngersoll </em>for the prosecutors.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b91-10\">The commission of the defendants was then produced signed by <em>M. </em>Lazoler, mayor, John Douglass <em>and John Barker, </em>aider-men, <em>F. Wolbert </em>and <em>J. Kessler, </em>justices of the county; and it was then in proof that the usage had been to summon nine or eleven magistrates, not less than four from the county and five from the city, the mayor always naming the individuals; that they generally met in the afternoon, and uniformly at the mayor\u2019s office; that the present mayor in the appointment previous to the last had followed this usage, in consequence of which so many magistrates attended of sentiments hostile to his own, that he was out-voted, and had joined in commissioning officers he did not approve; and that to guard against a repetition of this act, he summoned in this instance but four <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>magistrates, with whom he made the appointment at a tavern in ^e city, before nine o\u2019clock in the morning; one of the aldermen present being appointed one of the inspectors, and <em>joining in his own commission.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b92-6\">Upon these facts and the act of assembly, <em>Hopkinson </em>argued, that as the law does not designate any two justices or aldermen who are to hold the election, it does not give an authority to the mayor to select any two; that therefore, by a necessary inference, the power of electing is vested in the whole body of the magistrates of the city and county; <em>all </em>and <em>each </em>having an <em>equal </em>right to participate in it, although it may be done by <em>any two. </em>All therefore who attended and claimed the <em>right, were </em>illegally deprived of it by the refusal of the mayor to inform them of the time and place of holding the election. The legislature provides for an emergency, by requiring the assent of only a few, as there are circumstances under which only a few can be assembled; but beyond question, for the sake of the penitentiary institution, it intended to reserve the benefit which might arise from the counsels of the whole or a large portion, whenever the whole or the portion chose to advance their opinions, and legally demanded an opportunity to express them. If the contrary position be true, there is more than one consequence flowing from these provisions of the law totally irreconcileable with policy or common sense. In the first place, the opinion of nine tenths of the city and county magistrates may be rendered of no effect by the opposition of one tenth. This is contrary to the spirit of our laws in every other instance. In the next place, the mayor alone might as well make the whole appointment. For if he may summon to his assistance those only who suit him, and then clandestinely execute the law, it is clear that none but those of his own sentiment will receive an invitation, and therefore that his own candidates will always be appointed. This is contrary to the spirit of the particular law in question; for it is evident from the selection of at least two magistrates from the county and as many from the city, that the object of the law was to procure an expression of the public will from each of these districts, because it is to them that the regulations of the prison have a principal relation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b92-7\">Whether the mayor is an essential member of the appointing body, it is not material to inquire, as this is not a case in which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>an appointment has been made without his concurrence or against his will; our present point is that he has no discretion to reject the vote of any alderman or justice who presents himself for the purpose recited in the law; for if he has the discretion, he <em>may </em>usurp the whole power.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b93-4\">Let it be granted however for the sake of argument that the mayor has this discretion; we then say that he has exercised it in a manner so partial, <em>oppressive </em>and arbitrary, as calls for the exercise of the constitutional powers of the supreme court in this behffif.</p>\n<p data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b93-5\">The first circumstance of this kind in the case is, that it was not a bare neglect to summon the officers, but a deliberate denial of their right upon a claim made by them to exercise it. Another is the desertion of the ordinary <em>place </em>of meeting. The mayor\u2019s office as well as the most natural was the most usual scene of these appointments; and in changing it for an inn upon an occasion of this nature, it is certain that the object was to disappoint those who in a reliance upon usage should resort to the accustomed place. A third circumstance is the <em>hour. </em>There is a want of confidence in the measure betrayed by the parties themselves in the selection of the time. If the mayor has the discretion which is contended for, this is not the way in which he must exercise it to secure the protection of the law; it is a reasonable discretion alone that is defended by this court; and there is not a better ground for defeating a manifest <em>usurpation </em>of right, than there is for defeating a right thus oppressively, partially, and unjustly exercised. The <em>King </em>v. <em>Young </em>and <em>Pitts, </em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b93-7\">The common defence of a discretion thus used is <em>ignorance} </em>but it cannot be the plea of the present mayor. He was acquainted with the usage, as in one instance at least he pursued it. He was moreover advised to adhere to it by the constitutional counsel of the city; but the advice was rejected, although tile consequence was that <em>John Douglass </em>appointed and commissioned himself, <footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The spirit of the proceeding infects the whole appointment; and an information is the proper remedy.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"A4V\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>\n<em>Dickerson</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"A6vM\">argued, that the law provided for the <em>appointment </em>an&lt;^ not ^or t^e eiecizora of inspectors. An appointment is not necessarily an election; in the present case it bears no resemblance to an election; and the 'law has carefully avoided the use <em>q\u00a3 </em>tpe iatter term. Had the legislature intended that the inspectors should be placed in their offices by an election, the place, as well as the time, and the manner of conducting it, would have been pointed out, as in the case of other elections.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b94-4\">As the city and county are both interested, so they both ought to have some influence in the appointment of inspectors. To have given this power without control to the mayor, would have been doing injustice to the county. The only check, however, which the legislature thought proper to place upon the power of. the mayor was, that he should not appoint inspectors without the concurrence of at least two of the justices of the peace of the county, and two aldermen of the city; and with their concurrence he could undoubtedly make the appointment, even if all the other aldermen of the city, and all the other justices of the county should oppose him.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AdA\">It is said, that the mayor by summoning but two aldermen and two justices may always have the appointment made exactly to his own liking. But how did the conduct of the former mayors vary from this rule? It is true, they generally invited four justices and five aldermen to attend the appointments; but they took care to invite such only as would agree with them in the choice. There is no instance where one of those mayors has <em>merged </em>his own vote by inviting those who would vote against him; nor indeed was there any obligation upon them to do so. Those mayors had as full and absolute control over the appointments with five aldermen and four justices, as the present mayor had with two aldermen and two justices; the principle is precisely the same in the one case as in the other. The law is express, that the mayor, two aldermen and two justices shall have the power to appoint &amp;c.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b94-7\">It is said that the mayor, if he had the right of selection, has exercised it in a partial, <em>oppressive </em>and <em>arbitrary </em>manner; and that although he might not be bound to give <em>notice </em>&amp;c. to all the aldermen and justices, yet he was bound to give them that information when they applied for it; that they were entitled to this information as a matter of right.</p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b95-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>These questions are not fairly before the court. If the may- or has deprived these aldermen and justices of any of their rights, they have their remedy against him; they may bring their actions, or proceed against him as they please; but it is idle to proceed against the inspectors for injuries they have sustained from the mayor. It is sufficient for the inspectors that they hold a commission executed by the mayor, two aldermen, and two justices; they were bound to serve or be subject to a penalty; nor was it their business to inquire whether the mayor had deprived any person of his right to vote; these exceptions therefore to the conduct of the mayor ought not to have any influence in deciding the question before the court.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b95-4\">It is said that one of the inspectors is one of the appointing magistrates. But it does not follow from this that the appointment is bad. Even in the case of an election to a corporation office, it seems fairly inferible from the <em>King </em>v. <em>Malden </em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>that it is no objection to the officer that he presided at his own election, and was sworn in before himself. But the present case is merely an <em>appointment; </em>and it rests with the gentlemen in favour of the rule to shew that because a person is vested with the right to appoint, he is precluded from exercising that right in his own favour. If however the court should be of opinion that he could not concur in his own appointment and by that concurrence make it valid, it will not be denied that his concurrence in the appointment of others is good; his case therefore cannot in the slightest degree affect the appointment of the others.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b95-5\">The law does not fix the hour of the day nor the place of making the appointment; and there has not been sufficient time since the passing of the law to establish any rule upon the subject by custom. Nor indeed does it appear that there was any necessity for a meeting at all, if the concurrence of the mayor, two aldermen, and two justices, could have been obtained on the proper day without. The mayor has exercised his discretion upon these points, according to the spirit of the law. It is sufficient that the appointment was made on the proper day, and by the officers required by law to make the same.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b95-6\">\n<em>Ingersoll</em>\n</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Arkg\">in reply said that the question was not so much whether the mayor had a discretion, as whether he had exer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>cised it in a fair and reasonable manner, without which the appointment could no.t be valid. That whether it was called an appointment or an election was immaterial; for that where an authority may be exercised by several, equal opportunity of doing it should be given to all; and where this opportunity is <em>oppressively </em>withheld, it corrupts the whole proceeding. That the case of the <em>King </em>v. <em>Malden </em>did not apply, as the plaintiff did not elect himself; but the only point there decided was that he was not duly sworn in.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b93-8\"> 1 <em>Burr. 556 559.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"(b)\">\n<p id=\"b93-9\"><em> </em>It appeared that the recorder of the city had advised the mayor not to proceed to the appointment as lie did; but his advice was founded on the inexpediency of the measure rather than on any opinion he had formed of fif\u00ed illegalitv</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-3\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"Ao5\"> 4 <em>Burr. </em>2130.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b96-6\">The opinion of the court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b96-7\">Ye ates J.</author>\n<p id=\"AdX\"><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The words of the 17th sec. of the act of 23d <em>Sept. 1791 </em>are that \u201c it shall and may be lawful for the mayor and \u201c two aldermen of the city of <em>Philadelphia </em>and two justices of <em>il </em>the peace for the county of <em>Philadelphia to </em>appoint inspectors \u201c of the prison of the city and county of <em>Philadelphia </em>on the 1st <em>u Mondays </em>of <em>May </em>and <em>November </em>in every year, and on any <em>\u201c </em>other days when vacancies shall happen in the said office by <em>a </em>death resignation or otherwise.\u201d It appears to a majority of the court, that the legislature intended to vest in the mayor a certain legal discretion, which should be exercised in a iair, equal, and reasonable manner. The question is not, whether th\u00e9mayor is bound to give formal notice to all the aldermen ol the city, and justices of the peace of the county, when and where the appointment shall be proceeded upon: but whether when he has been called upon by persons of that description whom the law vests with a power of appointment, and who are desirous of exercising that right, he can legally refuse to give them information of the place and hour of appointment, and preclude them from giving their sentiments upon the subject. We are of opinion that he is not justified by law in this refusal; and thus proceeding to a nomination at an unusual hour and place is not such an exercise of his discretion as the law will warrant; because this would be in effect an assumption of the whole power by the mayor, which cannot be collected from the words of the law. One having a discretionary authority to appoint a fit person to a public office appointing himself, seems a solecism in terms; and it cannot be deemed the fulfilment of his duty. We 'perfectly concur with Mr. Recorder that whatever right the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>mayor had in this appointment, it was improper to exercise it in the manner he has done; and therefore think good and legal grounds have been shewn to file the information prayed for by the relators, in the nature of a <em>quo warranto.</em></p>\n<judges id=\"b97-9\">Brackenridge J.
