To this declaration the defendant demurred, and the plaintiff joined in demurrer, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark></summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b386-12\"><em>Sitgreaves </em>in support of the demurrer</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ABa1\">argued, 1. That the Associate Judge had no authority to discharge the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>from civil process, as the fifth section of the <em>habeas corpus </em>act explicitly provides that nothing therein shall extend to discharge out of prison any person charged with debt or other action, or with process in any civil cause. 2 <em>St. Laws </em>241. That therefore there was no legal discharge from this execution, and the defendant was justifiable in committing the plaintiff. 2. That the eleventh section, by which the penalty of five hundred pounds is imposed, relates exclusively to commitments and re-commitments for criminal or supposed criminal matter; that the thirteenth section, which is the first that applies to persons restrained of their liberty under other pretences, expressly orders the <em>habeas corpus </em>to be <em>awarded </em>and <em>granted </em>under the penalties before directed, but says nothing about penalties for other infractions of the law; and that the following section then applies to civil cases the same penalty imposed by the ninth section in criminal cases for <em>disobedience </em>of the writ, going no further; so that the <em>partial </em>repetition in these sections is conclusive to shew that the penalties of the first twelve sections are not extended <em>generally </em>to cases within the thirteenth, and that there is no penalty for a recommitment after a discharge from civil process. Restraints for supposed criminal matter are alone deserving of the severe punishment imposed by the eleventh section; as no dangerous attack upon the liberties of the citizen is likely to assume any other form than that of criminal accusation.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b387-6\"><em>Ewing </em>for the plaintiff contended</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AXv\">1. That the Judge had a right to discharge from civil execution; that the words of the act are sufficiently comprehensive for this purpose; and that the fifth section applies only to the case of a detainment at the same time for both civil and criminal matter, and was intended to prevent a discharge from the latter, from operating constructively as a discharge from both. 2. That the thirteenth section in the outset extends to civil cases all the penalties of the preceding sections, by extending the provisions of the act for <em>proceeding </em>on the <em>habeas </em>corpus, as well as for awarding and granting it; and the repetition of certain of the penalties, though it may be intended to enforce more explicitly the previous provisions, cannot, as there are no negative words, take away the evident effect of the affirmative clause. The reason for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>applying all the penalties, is as complete as that for applying any one of them.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b386-13\"> This cause was argued and decided at a Circuit Courtbolden in Northampton by the Chief Justice; but the importance of the decision, from which there has been no appeal, is thought to be a sufficient justification for inserting it.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"A6r\">Txlghman C. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A8o9\">The <em>habeas corpus </em>act contains distinct provisions for the relief of persons imprisoned for criminal and for civil matters. The first twelve sections relate to criminal matters. The eighth section imposes a penalty of 300/. on any judge or justice who shall refuse or neglect to <em>award, </em>any writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>required to be granted by the act. The ninth section imposes on officers, sheriffs, gaolers &amp;c. to whom writs of <em>habeas corpus </em>shall be directed, and who shall refuse or neglect to <em>make return </em>or to bring the body of the prisoner according to the command of the writ, a forfeiture to the party grieved of 100/. for the first offence, and for the second 200/. and also an incapacity on the officer to hold his office. The tenth section imposes the like forfeiture and incapacity on officers refusing to deliver, upon demand, <em>a copy of the warrant </em>of commitment and detainer of any prisoner. The eleventh section enacts that no person who shall be delivered on any <em>habeas cor</em>pus, shall be again committed or imprisoned for the <em>same of-fence </em>by any person whatever, other than by the legal order and process of such court wherein he is bound by recognisance to appear, or other court having jurisdiction of the cause; and that any person, who shall knowingly recommit or imprison such person for the same offence or supposed offence, shall forfeit to the party grieved five hundred pounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">It is very clear that this eleventh section relates solely to the cases of persons confined for criminal or supposed criminal matter; because it makes no mention of any persons but those who are committed for <em>offences.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">The thirteenth section extends \u201c all the provisions before \u201c made for the awarding and granting writs of <em>habeas corpus </em>\u201c and <em>proceeding </em>thereon, in case of commitment or detainer \u201c for any criminal or supposed criminal matter, to persons, not \u201c being committed or detained for any criminal or supposed \u201c criminal matter, but confined or restrained of their liberty \u201c under any colour or pretence whatsoever;\u201d and the same section goes on to provide that upon a certain oath being taken, \u201c a <em>habeas corpus </em>shall be awarded and granted in the same \u201c manner, and under the same penalties, to be recovered from \u201c the same persons as is herein before directed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>It is contended by the plaintiff, that under the general words of the thirteenth section, all penalties of every Icind imposed any persons in any cases whatever by any of the preceding sections, are extended to civil cases. The most general words in the thirteenth section are those which mention \u201c all provisions \u201c before made for the awarding and granting writs of <em>habeas </em>\u201c corpus, and <em>proceeding </em>thereon.\u201d Had the provision respecting civil matters stopt there, there might have been some ground for the argument, that the intent of the law was to extend the same penalties which had been imposed in criminal matters, to all persons and all cases in civil matters. But it is evident that such was not the opinion of the legislature, because in a subsequent part of the same section a <em>habeas corpus </em>is ordered to be <em>awarded </em>and <em>granted </em>in the same manner and under the same penalties, to be recovered from the same persons as is before directed. Now if the first part of the section had been sufficient to extend all penalti\u00e9s in all cases, the latter part extending one of the penalties in a particular case, would have been not only unnecessary but improper. But to make the matter still clearer, the fourteenth section goes on to provide particular penalties in other particular civil cases; that is to say, in cases of writs of <em>habeas corpus </em>not being returned, or the bodies of prisoners not being- produced by the persons to whom the writs are directed; but there is a total omission of any penalty for imprisoning a person a second time for the same cause for which he had been before imprisoned and discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">If it is asked why a penalty should not be inflicted upon a second imprisonment in a civil as well as in a criminal case, it is sufficient to answer, that the case being omitted, the penalty cannot be inflicted, even supposing that such omission was by accident, and without reason. But there may have been a very good reason why this penalty was designedly omitted in civil cases. It is this; that the object of the <em>habeas corpus </em>act was to protect the liberty of individual citizens; and the danger of oppression is not so great in civil matters, as in case of crimes or supposed crimes. Governments often-magnify real crimes, and sometimes impute offences falsely to innocent persons, for the purpose of oppression. From this quarter has generally arisen the danger to liberty; and this might have induced the legislature of <em>Pennsylvania </em>to omit the penalty in civil cases. Be that as it may, as they have omitted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>it,and as it is a well established rule of construction that penal-are not t0 imPosec*- without express words, or necessary implication, I am of opinion that the plaintiff is not entitled to recover the penalty of 500/, upon the case stated in his declaration. Judgment must be entered for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">Judgment for defendant.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
