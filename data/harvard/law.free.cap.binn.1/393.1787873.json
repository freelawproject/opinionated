The declaration contained five counts; four of which charged that the defendant spoke &amp;c. of and concerning the plaintiff \u201c <em>in substance </em>the following false, \u201c scandalous, and defamatory words;\u201d and one of the counts laid words which' were not actionable.

The motion was overruled by his Honour, and judgment entered for the plaintiff; upon which the defendant appealed to this court, Upon the report of the case here by Judge Yeates, it appeared that no material evidence was given which applied par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>ticularly to the defective count, the fourth $ but that all of it aPPlied to the good counts-</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"Aat\">.5'. <em>B.

There is no pretence for supporting the fourth count, unless by the <em>innuendo; </em>but as it is the proper business of an <em>innuendo </em>to explain matter sufficiently expressed before, and not to add to or extend the words, according to <em>The King </em>v. Horn, <em>(a) </em>the <em>innuendo </em>cannot help the declaration. If no evidence had been given upon the bad count, it might have been in the power of the Circuit Court to amend the verdict, by entering it upon the good counts; but some evidence was given, and whether it had weight with the jury or not, it is impossible to say.</p>\n<p data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AbC\">The plaintiff in the next place ought to have set out certain words, notwithstanding he is permitted to prove their substance. For if he is allowed to set out the substance as well as to prove it, it will not only be a material innovation upon the practice, but the court cannot say upon the face of the declaration whether the words spoken are actionable, and it may tend to surprize by rendering the charge too indefinite for the defendant to meet it. There is no precedent of such a declaration to be found.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"AYbD\"><em>Baldwin </em>for the plaintiff.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AUF\">The words \u201c in substance\u201d may at all events be considered as surplusage; but if not, still as the plaintiff is allowed to prove the substance of the words laid, there can be no reason against his laying the substance, because the same principle governs both cases; it is the charge by the defendant which is material, and not the very words, and for this there is a direct precedent in 1 <em>Rich. Prac. B. R. </em>108.</p>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AmI\">As to the other objection, this court may decide as the Circuit Court ought to have done; it stands in the same situation; and the case is to be treated as if it originated here. The report of the Judge shews that no material evidence applied immediately to the bad count, and that all of it applied properly to the good counts; the verdict may therefore be amended by his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>\u00abotes. <em>Williams </em>v. <em>Breedon </em><footnotemark>(a)</footnotemark>, <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>Harrison </em><footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark>, <em>Stafford </em>v. <em>Green </em><footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark>.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b407-3\"><em>A.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"A4U\">This is an appeal from the Circuit Court of <em>Crawford </em>county. It is an action of slander which was tried in <em>October </em>1806. A verdict was found for the plaintiff, and entire damages assessed. The defendant moved in arrest of judgment, the motion was overruled by Judge <em>Teates, </em>and from his decision the defendant appealed to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">The reasons urged in support of the appeal are two. 1. That the declaration contains five counts, in four of which it is alleged that the defendant spoke <em>in substance </em>the words following viz. \u2014 and then the words are inserted. It is contended that the declaration is bad, because those counts do not set forth the very words which the defendant spoke, without which the court cannot judge whether they are actionable. It was formerly held, that unless the plaintiff proved the identical words laid in the declaration, he failed in supporting his action; but this strictness has long been relaxed; and it is now sufficient, as 'is conceded by the defendant\u2019s counsel, if the plaintiff proves that the defendant spoke words <em>substantially </em>the same as those laid in the declaration, <footnotemark><em>(d)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>This being the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>case, we see no reason why it is not sufficient to allege that the spolce certain words <em>in substance </em>as follows &amp;c. If he does not prove words of the same substance, he fails; if he does prove them, the <em>allegata </em>and <em>probata </em>agree; and as to the Court\u2019s judging whether the words are actionable, it is easy for them to determine whether the <em>substance laid </em>in the decla<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>ration is actionable; if it is, the declaration will in that respect be good. It was objected by the defendant\u2019s, counsel that no precedent to support such a mode of declaring could be produced. But one'precedent has been produced from 1 <em>Rich. Pract. B. R. </em>108. where the <em>purport </em>of words was laid, which is in effect the <em>substance </em>of the words; and we make no doubt but that other precedents may be found to the same purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">The <em>second </em>reason of the appeal is that the fourth count is bad, the words contained in it not being actionable; and th\u00a7 jury having assessed entire damages, judgment could not properly be entei-ed upon it.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">There is no doubt of its being a settled principle that judgment cannot be entered upon a verdict assessing entire damages in slander, where one of the counts is bad. But it is equally certain, that this principle has often produced an arrest of judgment contrary to the merits of the case. Accordingly, for some time past, the courts have done all in their power to get rid of it, so far as is necessary to do justice to the parties. The reasoh of the rule is, that as the jury have blended in their damages the words that are actionable with those that are not actionable, it is impossible for the court to separate them, so as to make the defendant answerable only for the actionable words. But in cases where no material evidence has been given, except what went in support of the actionable words, it is to be presumed that the jury, in forming their verdict, paid no regard to any words but those which were actionable. In such cases the court, to support the intent of the jury, will direct the verdict to be entered for the plaintiff on those counts only which are good.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">It appears from the report of the Judge who tried the cause that this was a case of the nature last mentioned. There is no doubt therefore that he might on application to him have directed the verdict to be entered on those counts to which there is no objection, if the plaintiff\u2019s counsel had thought of asking it; but in the hurry of business this was overlooked. But can this court do it? The defendant\u2019s counsel contend that we cannot, because we are sitting as a Court of Error, and can take no notice of the evidence. This would certainly be the case were we acting on a writ of error from a Court of Common Pleas. But this cause does not come before us on a writ of error, but on an appeal of a special nature. By the act of 20th <em>March 1799, </em>4 <em>St. Laws </em>562. the Courts of <em>Nisi Prius </em>were abolished <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>in all the counties of the state, except the county of <em>Philadelphia, </em>and instead of them-were established Circuit Courts to be held by one or more Judges of the Supreme Court. The 0bject of this change was to make the administration of justice as convenient as possible, by bringing not only the trial, but all the proceedings (the judgment included) to every man\u2019s home. It was also an object, in case of dissatisfaction with the opinion of the judge before whom the cause was tried, to obtain the decision of the Supreme Court, with the same ease and dispatch with which it had been before obtained after trials at <em>Nisi </em>Prius; and further, it was thought desirable (as business in the Circuit Courts must generally be dispatched in a hurry) to give an appeal from decisions on <em>motions </em>for new trials, and other motions, upon which no writ of error would lie. The words of the act are as follows: \u201c If either of the parties is dissatisfied with the \u201cjudgment or decision of the said Circuit Court on any de- \u201c murrer, case stated, special verdict, point reserved for the \u201c consideration of the court on the trial, <em>motion in arrest of </em>\u201c <em>judgment or for a new </em>trial, or to set aside a judgment, dis- \u201c continuance, or nonpros, that then and in such case the party \u201c so dissatisfied may appeal &amp;c.\u201d The practice under this law has been such as to render the proceedings on the appeal as little expensive and as expeditious as possible. On an appeal in case of a motion for a new trial, the Judge who tried the cause, reports the evidence from his notes, just as if the trial had been at <em>Nisi Prius. </em>Now upon the true construction of this law, we conceive that this court is placed in the same situation on an appeal from a Judge\u2019s decision on a motion in arrest of judgment, as the Judge himself stood when the motion was made before him; of consequence we have a right to examine the evidence, and to take any steps for supporting the verdict which he might have taken. We have heard his report of the evidence, from which we think ourselves justified in directing that the Circuit Court shall cause the verdict to be entered on all the counts but the fourth for the plaintiff, and on the fourth count for the defendant; and that then judgment be entered for the plaintiff on that verdict.</p>\n<footnote label=\"(d)\">\n<p id=\"b407-9\"><em> </em>Upon a question connected with this doctrine, the reporter has been favoured by Judge Rush with bis opinion, adopted by the Court of Common Pleas, in the following case decided in <em>February </em>1808.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-10\">Tracy J <em>Tracy </em>the plaintiff obtained a verdict in slander for <em>v. </em>i- forty five dollars. Upon the trial a point was reserved for Harkins J tile opinion of the court, whether words laid in the second person, <em>\u201c </em>you are a thief,\u201d are supported bv evidence that they were spoken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>in the third person, \u201c he is a thief;\u201d and that point was accordingly argued upon a rule to shew cause why there should not be a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"A7y\">Rush President. In actions of slander, the general rul\u00e9is, that it is sufficient if the plaintiff proves the <em>substance </em>of the words, as laid in his declaration. As an illustration of this rule, it is expressly stated bv <em>Bu'ler, </em>m bis <em>Law </em>of <em>Nisi Ptius </em>published in 1772, that words laid in the <em>second </em>person, are substantially proved by evidence they were spoken in the <em>third </em>person. This was clearly the law of the land, and universally admitted to be so, till the year 1773, when Lord <em>Mansfield </em>unfortunately adopted a different opinion in the case of <em>Averillo </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>the report of which I have not been able to find in my researches. He is said to have decided, that words laid in the <em>third </em>person are not supported by proof they were spoken in the <em>second </em>person, there being a difference, sa&gt;s his Lordship, between words in a passion to a man\u2019s face, and spoken deliberately behind his back, the <em>first </em>being more excusable. <em>Esp. </em>521. Doubtless there is a difference between words spoken in a passion, and deliberately; but surely it does not follow, that because words of slander are spoken to a man\u2019s face, they were spoken in a passion; and even if it were the case, it could be considered in no other light, than a circumstance to extenuate damages, and can have no tendency to prove they are not <em>substantially </em>the same with words spoken deliberately. The uttering words in a passion, or deliberately, is matter of evidence to be left to the jury. Whether words are <em>substantially </em>proved as laid, and whether they are <em>more </em>or <em>less </em>excusable, are <em>distinct </em>things; the former being matter of law, the latter a proper subject of inquiry for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"AmqV\">The old law which declared the words are substantially proved, if spoken in <em>one </em>person and proved in <em>another, </em>appears to be founded in reason and good sense. The substantial ground of the action is <em>charging </em>the plaintiff with being a thief; and whether the charge be conveyed in the <em>second </em>or <em>third </em>person, tlie crime is equally imputed. Whether the imputation of theft is openly made to a man\u2019s face, or at a few yards distance, and out of his hearing, the accusation is the same, and the slander the same; and the damages should depend, not on the words being spoken to the face of a man, which may be in a passion or otherwise, but on the malice and deliberation with which they are delivered, and ne requency of their repetition.</p>\n<p id=\"Aiyp\">In our opinion the law has been long settled in <em>Pennsylvania, </em>agreeably to the old edition of <em>Buller; </em>and we are happy on this occasion, that we are not obliged to entangle justice in netts of law, or to sacrifice the dictates'' of common sense upon the altar of high authority. Let the rule be discharged.</p>\n<p id=\"AGL1\">Vide <em>Rex </em>v. <em>Berry, </em>4 <em>D. &amp; E. </em>217.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
