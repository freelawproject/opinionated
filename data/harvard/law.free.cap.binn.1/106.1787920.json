It was tried at Nisi Prius in Februar~i 1804, before SHIPPnN C. J. and Si~xTix J. when a verdict was found for the defendant, subject to the opinion of the court upon a case which was in substance this: D'.wson and Watt, merchants at C'ape Franco~s, were the common agent of plaintiff and defendant, and were indebted t~ both at the time hereafter mentiqned, for the proceeds of sundry cargoes consigned to them. B. F. Garrigues the owner of the brig ~ulia addressed her in the latter part of 1801 to D. &amp; W. with a direction to the captain to conform in all respects to their orders. On the 23d Jan. 1802, D. &amp; W~ wrote to the defendant as follows: \"This goes by way of Ba1t~mere and is merely to \"inform you that we shall ship for your account on board the \"brig Julia, Samuel Holt master, sailing for your port on or \"about the 1st next month the auantitv of 7000 lbs. </em>coffee <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>\u201c or thereabouts.* By her we shall write you more fully, and \u201c remain your assured friends <em>D. </em>and <em>W.* </em>It being your pro- \u201c portion of the balance of the brig Agnes\u2019 cargo. <em>D. </em>and W.\u201d On the <em>31st January </em>1802, the captain having taken on board his cargo for Philadelphia, signed bills of lading for eight hogsheads and nine barrels of coffee marked T E, deliverable to the <em>defendant </em>or his assigns, one of which bills <em>D. </em>and <em>W. </em>left with the captain together with letters for the consignees. The brig was detained until the 4th of <em>February </em>when <em>Cape Francois </em>was burned by the blacks, and property to a great amount in the stores of <em>D. </em>and <em>W. </em>destroyed. On the 10th <em>February </em>D. and <em>W. </em>prevailed upon the captain to deliver up the bills of lading and letters; and with a view to equalize the loss among their different employers, took two hogsheads from the quantity shipped for the defendant, and addressed them to the plaintiff, presenting at the same time bills for the signature of the captain, varied accordingly from the former bills. The captain at first refused to sign, as an alteration had been made in the quantity shipped to his owner, but was 'compelled to it by the assurance of <em>D. </em>and <em>W. </em>that until it was done the brig should not sail. From the 31st <em>January </em>to the 10th <em>February </em>the vessel remained in the harbour under her first bills of lading, her bulk never broken, nor the marks of the hogsheads or barrels in any way altered. On the 4th of <em>March </em>after an embargo the brig-sailed, and on her arrival, the captain being informed by the defendant that according to a letter\u2019from <em>D. </em>and <em>W. </em>the quantity due by the bill of lading last signed fell short of the amount shipped, by two hogsheads, put the property in question on shore, when the defendant got possession. The plaintiff entered and secured the duties upon them, and then brought the present action.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b119-6\">Upon these facts <em>M. Levy </em>for the plaintiff</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AaF\">argued that the common factor of both parties had a right to alter the destination in this case; that the captain was the agent of <em>Dawson </em>and <em>Watt </em>since he was tied down in all respects to their orders; and that the delivery of the property and bill of lading to him was a revocable act, since it might be considered as a delivery to themselves; and that the most to which the letter and first bill of lading amounted, was a promise of a bill of lading, which however it might affect the contracting parties, passed no pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>perty. The interference by the agents was to equalize a severe among many, before the means of so doing had gone out o\u00ed their hands.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b120-6\"><em>Eazule </em>for the defendant</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AHQ\">answered that the coffee was shipped from the funds of <em>Elder </em>in the hands of <em>Dawson </em>and <em>Watt; </em>that the property vested by the delivery to the captain, that it was at the defendant\u2019s risk from the 31st <em>January </em>to the 10th <em>Fe</em>bruary, and that the interference of <em>Dawson </em>and <em>Watt </em>was to make <em>Elder </em>contribute to <em>SummeriPs </em>loss, which they had no right to do. A bill of lading clearly vests the property in him in whose favour it is made and for whose use it is delivered, <em>Evans </em>v. Marlett, <footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and the captain became the agent of <em>Elder </em>as to this property the moment the bill was delivered. How then could the general agents of <em>Elder </em>devest the property? They could do it only in the character of agents, or under the common power of stopping in transitu. As agents their authoritv was supplanted by that of another agent upon the delivery of the bill of lading. As to stopping in transitu this case never occurs but as between vendor and vendee, and as between them the vendor can stop in transitu only when the vendee has become bankrupt, or when no consideration has passed from the vendee to him. <em>Snee </em>v. Prescott, <footnotemark>(b)</footnotemark> <em>Wright et al. </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em><footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> <em>Lickbarrow </em>v. <em>Mason, </em><footnotemark><em>(d)</em></footnotemark><em> Ellis and others </em>v. <em>Hunt, </em><footnotemark><em>(e)</em></footnotemark><em> Kinloch </em>v. <em>Craig, </em><footnotemark><em>(f)</em></footnotemark><em> Sweet </em>v. <em>Pym, </em><footnotemark>(g)</footnotemark> <em>Alderson </em>v.

Justice here very clearly supported the plaintiff\u2019s claim.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b120-12\"> 1 <em>L.
