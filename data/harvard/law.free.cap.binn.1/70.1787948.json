The remedy of the Canal Company is not confined to the forfeiture authorized by the 10th section. 3 <em>St. Laws </em>280. There is a positive unconditional promise by each <em>original </em>stockholder to pay two hundred dollars for every share subscribed. It is a promise made unconditionally before any corporation existed. Without such promise no plan could have been concerted; the penalty would operate to distress the punctual and to release the defaulters. The canal was an enterprise of such vast Magnitude, and so entirely useless without completion, that any other object in framing the terms of subscription, and the sections of the act, than that of exacting the whole sum, would have been folly.</p>\n<p data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b84-12\">The <em>forfeiture </em>is given as a security to the general powers of the corporation; as a mode of compelling under certain circumstances a more prompt payment of the instalments, than by the process we now adopt; as a means to <em>enforce </em>without <em>merging </em>the original obligation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b84-13\">The rule of <em>Pothier </em>in his treatise on obligations is the true and reasonable rule. 44 When the penalty has for its end to in-44 sure performance of the principal obligation, it does not de44 stroy it.\u201d 1 <em>Oblig. </em>328. Where a penalty is intended merely to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>secure the enjoyment of a collateral object, the enjoyment of the object is considered as the principal intent of the deed, and' the penalty only as accessional. <em>Sloman </em>v. <em>Walter. </em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Equity considers the penalty only as a collateral guard to the agreement, which still remains the same, and unimpeached by the parties, providing a <em>further remedy </em>at law for the performance. 1 <em>Fonbl. </em>141. <em>Lowe </em>v. <em>Peers. </em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>2 <em>Pow. on Contr. </em>136. <em>Howard </em>v. <em>Hopkins, </em><footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> 3 <em>Bl. Com.434. Parks </em>v. <em>Wilson, </em><footnotemark><em>(d)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>12 <em>Vin. </em>204. <em>pl. </em>3.</p>\n<p data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b85-6\"><em>The transferee </em>is in the same situation by this act, as the original subscriber; he takes the share <em>cumonere. 3 Woodes. 87, </em>2 <em>Danv. Ab. </em>238. 6 <em>Finer </em>463.</p>\n<p data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b85-8\">For the defendant. This case turns upon the construction of a statute by the common rules; and which, inasmuch as it is a particular statute, cannot be construed beyond the letter. <em>Threadneedle </em>v. <em>Lynam, </em><footnotemark><em>(e)</em></footnotemark><em> Litt. Rep. 247.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b85-9\">Every contract, whatever may be its expressions, must be expounded according to the intention of the parties. The intention must be drawn from the whole instrument; and references to and recitals of other instruments make them part of, or incorporate them with the principal instrument. 2 <em>Saund. </em>412.</p>\n<p data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b85-10\">Where the penalty is intended as a collateral security, the principal obligation is not waived; but this is not our case. The contract according to the first section is good for nothing unless it refers to the act; it is without object, without consideration, without parties; and in addition to this, there is a clause of direct reference contained in the very body of the contract. The error lies in separating the agreement from the law; the contract is then taken as a distinct engagement, and the forfeiture as a distinct penalty; but when considered together, the different sections of the law ar\u00e9 like so many paragraphs in a will, which courts will so mould as to get at the intention; and the forfeiture is then seen to be the <em>very </em>penalty of the contract, and the only one.</p>\n<p data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b85-11\">There is in the first place no <em>discretion </em>left to the company whether they will or will not forfeit the shares. The forfeiture is <em>peremptory; </em>\u201c the sa\u00edne <em>shall </em>be forfeited.\u201d It takes place <em>ipso </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number><em>facto </em>upon delinquency-; there is no inquest, no publication pveparatory to it. Can the legislature have intended this as an additional penalty', yvhen at all events it must be indicted? Is it alternative when there is no choice? It being the duty of the corporation to consider these shares as forfeited, an omission by them cannot alter the case of the subscribers, who are by the tenth section completely discharged. A remedy given by statute must be pursued, particularly by corporations, the very creatures of statute. <em>Kirk </em>v. <em>Nowill, </em><footnotemark><em>(a)</em></footnotemark><em> Rex </em>v. <em>Croke. </em><footnotemark><em>(b)</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The application of <em>shall </em>to the forfeiture, and of <em>shall </em>and <em>may </em>to the sale, very clearly' sheyvs the intention of the legislature.</p>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b86-4\">The forfeiture is not intended to <em>enforce payment, </em>but it is to destroy his right to hold the share, and therefore discharges his obligation. It is in the nature of a <em>liquidated </em>satisfaction, which cannot be exceeded or waived. <em>Rolfe </em>v. <em>Patterson, </em><footnotemark>(c)</footnotemark> 1 <em>Fonbl. 142.</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b86-5\">The act says that <em>Sansom </em>is not a stockholder; the corporation say he is; and the court would repeal this section of the charter^ if they should coincide with the corporation.</p>\n<p data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b86-6\">[Smith J. If the penalty goes to themselves, cannot they remit it?]</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b86-7\">We conceive not. They have no poyver by a bylaw to excuse what by the articles of their constitution it is compulsory upon them to exact. But if he is a member of the corporation, their general authority does not extend to suits against their own members as such. They must have the power specially granted. ' ;</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b86-8\">As to <em>transferee, </em>he has not promised either expressly or impliedly. By the seventh section he takes the shares <em>subject to payments due and to groxu due, </em>and nothing further.</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b86-9\">In reply, the obligation of the transferee wuis given up. But the power of suing its own members ivas said to be incidental to every corporation; and moreover that at the time of making the subscription, there yyas no corporation, but individuals to whom the corporation succeeded.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b86-10\">The question of penal interest yvas scarcely touched upon in the argument, as it seemed to be acknoyvledged that it was a mere prelude to forfeiture, and could not be exacted under the bond.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"(a)\">\n<p id=\"b85-12\"> 1 <em>Bro.

The terms of subscription must no doubt be taken with the act at large, but there is nothing in the act to annul the unconditional and express promise demanded by the first section. The power given to the compariyby the tenth section is merely discretionary; the penalty is in favour of the company, it is intended to enforce the payment of the subscription, and they may waive it as they have done in this case. As to the original shares then, there. must be judgment for the plaintiffs for the sum remaining due, with interest at six per cent.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">The shares which the defendant holds as transferee stand on a different ground; as to them he has given no express promise to pay, and the act has made no other provision than that tile `~thare~ should be subject to the payments.</p>\n<judges id=\"b87-8\">SHIPPEN C.
