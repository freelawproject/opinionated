While the Chancellor upheld the validity of the ordinance, he deleted certain sections, to-wit: paragraphs c, f, g and j of Section 2, subsection 1; and subsections 6 and 13 of Section 4. In the opinion of the Chancellor, these deleted sections offended Section 1, Article 8, of the Constitution of Tennessee, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-8\">\u201cThat no man shall be taken or imprisoned, or disseized of his freehold, liberties or privileges, or outlawed, or exiled, or in any manner destroyed, or deprived of his life, liberty, or property, but by the judgment of his peers or the law of the land.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b361-9\">In order to understand the problem, it is necessary that we copy the ordinance, which is as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b361-10\">\u201cAn Ordinance to Regulate the Manner of Holding Auctions Within the City of Jackson so as to Prevent Defrauding of the Public; to Regulate Auctioneers; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>to Provide for Permits for Holding- of Auctions; Manner of Applying for Same; to Declare Certain Offenses a Misdemeanor; and to Provide a Penalty for tlie Violation Hereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-5\">\u201cBe It Ordained by the Board of Commissioners of the City of Jackson:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-6\">\u201c\u00a1Section 1. That from and after the effective date of this Ordinance all public or private auctions of personal property within the City of Jackson shall be controlled and governed by the provisions of this Ordinance, except auctions held pursuant to the order of a Court of Records, or to sales of executors or administrators, bona fide sales by trustees under recorded mortgages or deeds of trust, or by lien holders acting in accordance with law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-7\">\u201cSection 2. Be It Further Ordained that no person, firm or corporation directly or indirectly through agents or otherwise shall conduct any auction described in Section 1 hereof without first having obtained a permit for conducting same, through a regularly licensed auctioneer, as hereinafter provided.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-8\">\u201c1. Any person desiring to conduct such an auction sale shall first file a written application for permit therefor with the Board of Commissioners stating:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-9\">\u201ca. The name, address, and occupation or business of the person, firm or corporation desiring to conduct such auction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-10\">\u201cb. The name, address .and occupation or business of the person, firm or corporation for whom the auction is to be conducted, if other than the applicant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-11\">\u201cc. The name and address of the owner of the merchandise, stock of goods, or other personal property to be offered at such auction, with a true, complete, itemized and sworn inventory of such prop<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>erty, showing the cost price thereof and the source of the title thereto, said cost information to he treated as confidential by the Board of Commissioners, except in prosecution for violation of this Ordinance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-4\">\u201cd. The place and hour of such auction with an estimate of the duration thereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-5\">\u2018\u2018e. A statement showing dates, places and nature of merchandise sold at all other auction sales by the applicant and/or the owner of the property to be auctioned within two (2) years next preceding the date of the application.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-6\">\u2018\u2018f. Whether or not additional merchandise, other than the inventory filed, or what is called \u2018fill in\u2019 stock, will be offered at such auction and if so, the general nature and previous ownership of such additional \u2018fill in\u2019 stock, with a true, complete and itemized sworn inventory thereof, showing the cost price and source of title thereof, said cost information to be treated as confidential by the Board of Commissioners, except in prosecution in violation of the Ordinance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-7\">\u201cg. A copy of proposed advertisements to be made of such auction; and/or an agreement by the applicant, that the quantity or history of the merchandise will not be misrepresented in any advertisement thereof.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-8\">\u201ch. Whether or not any other application for permit by him or the owner of the goods has been refused; and/or whether any such permit has been revoked or challenged after its issuance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-9\">\u201ci. The name and address of the Auctioneer or Auctioneers who will call or cry the auction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-10\">\u201cj.

Subsection 6 prohibited the sale \u00f3f' any merchandise which did not have firmly attached thereto the name of the manufacturer; and subsection 13 of Section 4 prohibited the dealer from selling or offering for sale at such .auction any article not specifically listed in the inventory, filed with the Board of Commissioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">The ordinance attacked, if upheld, must he under the police power of the city which enables municipalities to pass regulations to promote the public health, morals, safety and general welfare.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">The leading case in Tennessee is <em>Spencer-Sturla Co. </em>v. <em>City of </em>Memphis, 155 Tenn. 70, 290 S. W. 608, in which it was held in a zoning ordinance that exclusion from a residential district of a commercial enterprise generally is a valid exercise of the police power and is not unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">We have no case in point in Tennessee.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-10\">The decision of the Legislature as to what is a sufficient reason to justify a classification made in police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>measures will not be reviewed by the courts unless it is palpably arbitrary. <em>Darnell </em>v. <em>Shapard, </em>156 Tenn. 544, 3 S. W. (2d) 661; <em>Chattanooga Dayton Bus Lines </em>v. <em>Burney, </em>160 Tenn. 294, 23 S. W. (2d) 669.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-3\">Where the specific power to regulate a business is conferred by the Legislature\u2019upon the Board of Commissioners of a city, such Board of Commissioners has the right to \u201cregulate\u201d and to adjust by rule, method or governing principles of law. <em>State ex rel. Saperstein </em>v. <em>Bass, </em>177 Tenn. 609, 152 S. W. (2d) 236; <em>Silverman </em>v. <em>City of Chattanooga, </em>165 Tenn. 642, 57 S. W. (2d) 552.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">The power to exercise a sound discretion is implicit in the power to regulate. <em>State ex rel. Major </em>v. <em>Cummings, </em>178 Tenn. 378, 158 S. W. (2d) 713, 139 A. L. R. 837; <em>Large </em>v. <em>City of Elizabethton, </em>185 Tenn. 156, 203 S. W. (2d) 907.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">An ordinance is not invalid merely because it regulates a lawful business and due process of law is not denied when an ordinance fairly and reasonably regulates a lawful business.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">The holding of certain provisions of an Act invalid does not destroy the entire Act so long as there is enough left where it is capable of being\u2019executed in accordance with the apparent legislative intent. <em>Miller </em>v. <em>City of Memphis, </em>181 Tenn. 15, 178 S. W. (2d) 382, 151 A. L. R. 1172.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">Complainant\u2019s statement in his bill that the ordinance is not valid is not supported by statements of specific facts from which complainant might draw .such a conclusion and in the absence of further statements of specific facts justifying the conclusions therein, such statements are insufficient to evoke the aid of a court of equity, as is here sought.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">From 111 A. L. R., p. 473, we quote the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-9\">\u201cThe general proposition that the business of auctioneering is a legitimate subject of regulation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>to prevent abuses and frauds, which, was laid down in the annotation in 31 A. L. R. at page 299, and was also supported by the cases cited in the supplemental annotation in 39 A. L. R. at page 773, has found additional support in the following more recent cases: <em>Alabama.</em>\u2014 Davidson v. <em>Phelps </em>(1926) 214 Ala. 236, 107 So. 86; Arkansas.\u2014See <em>Balesh </em>v. <em>Hot Springs </em>(1927) 173 Ark. 661, 293 S. W. 14; California.\u2014[In] Re West (1925) 75 Cal. App. 591, 243 P. 55; Florida. <em>\u2014Levy </em>v. <em>Stone </em>(1929) 97 Fla. 458, 121 So. 565; <em>Georgia.\u2014Clein </em>v. <em>Atlanta </em>(1927) 164 Ga. 529, 139 S. E. 46, 53 A. L. R. 933; <em>Indiana</em>.\u2014Gordon v. <em>Indianapolis </em>(1932) 204 Ind. 79, 183 N. E. 124; Kentucky<em>\u2014Com. </em>v. <em>Loeb </em>(1932) 245 Ky. 843, 54 S. W. (2d) 373; <em>Michigan,</em>\u2014Saigh v. <em>Petoskey </em>(1930) 251 Mich. 77, 231 N. W. 107; <em>Mississippi.</em>\u2014Matheny v. <em>Simmons </em>(1932) 165 Miss. 429, 139 So. 172; New Jersey.<em>\u2014Wagman </em>v. <em>Trenton </em>(1926) 102 N. J. L. 492, 134 A. 115; <em>Wisconsin.</em>\u2014Doering v. <em>Swoboda </em>(1934) 214 Wis. 481, 253 N. W. 657.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">In <em>City of San Antonio </em>v. <em>South Trunk Co., </em>Tex. Civ. App., 13 S. W. (2d) 401, the court had under consideration the validity of an ordinance of the City of San Antonio regulating, among other things, the sale of trunks by .auction. This ordinance also proposed to regulate the auction sales of jewelry, pictures, paintings, rugs, trunks, suitcases, etc., but should not apply to judicial sale or sales by trustees, etc.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-7\">Practically all of the courts that have passed on what are called \u201cjewelry auction ordinances\u201d have upheld them. <em>Davidson </em>v. <em>Phelps, </em>214 Ala. 236, 107 So. 86; Ex <em>parte West, </em>75 Cal. App. 591, 243 P. 55; <em>Mogul </em>v. <em>Gaither, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>142 Md. 380, 121 A. 32.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">As will be seen from <em>City of San Antonio </em>v. <em>South Trunk Co., </em>supra, that ordinance was broader than the ordinary jewelry ordinance and covered pictures, paintings, rugs, trunks and suitcases.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">The whole idea of these ordinances is to protect the public and to minimize deception. Deception can be had in the auction sale of furniture just as much as in the auction sale of rugs, suitcases and trunks. We think the holding in the Texas case just referred to is sound.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">We have considered the case of <em>Perry Trading Co. </em>v. <em>City of Tallahassee, </em>128 Fla. 424, 174 So. 854, 111 A. L. R. 463, holding invalid an ordinance such as the one now before us but we are of the opinion that the Texas case supra is the sounder view.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">We have not taken up the various parts of the Ordinance separately but we have carefully read the Ordinance and we believe the Chancellor has reached the right conclusion in upholding the validity of the Ordinance after striking out the several parts enumerated in his decree.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">It results that the decree of the Chancellor is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
