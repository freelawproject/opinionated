Each was sentenced to 30 days in the county jail, which sentence was suspended and each was placed on one year\u2019s probation and fined $500.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-7\">Appellants raise the following legal contentions:</p>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">I \u2014 They were denied fundamental procedural due process in that they were never apprised with sufficient certainty of the nature and cause of the accusation against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">II \u2014 They were denied their right not to be proceeded against summarily for contempt except bjr a member of the judiciary.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">Ill \u2014 Assuming that the charge tried by the prosecutor was properly within the order to show cause then the trial court had no jurisdiction in the matter because the prosecutor charged nothing more than a violation by an attorney of a disciplinary rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>IV \u2014 The State failed to charge an offense under the summary contempt power as defined by <em>In Re Szczepanik, </em>37 <em>N. J. </em>503 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">V \u2014 The trial court committed prejudicial error by applying a definition of the offense of contempt manifestly erroneous under State law.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">VI \u2014 -The substantive common law standard for the offense of contempt is vague and indefinite in violation of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">VII \u2014 They fully complied with the disciplinary rules.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">VIII \u2014 If their professional conduct was in compliance with the disciplinary rules, then they could not properly be convicted for contempt on the basis of such conduct consistent with the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-9\">IX \u2014 They cannot properly be convicted of contempt of court for failure to disclose information which they had a legal obligation not to disclose.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-10\">X \u2014 -The evidence adduced in this ease does not disclose a contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-11\">XI \u2014 If this court finds appellants guilty of contempt, a sentence less harsh than that imposed below is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-12\">We conclude that all of the above contentions and the arguments raised in support thereof, including the similar points urged in the <em>amicus curiae </em>brief of the Public Defender, are without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-13\">Pursuant to our appellate responsibility, we have reviewed the evidence herein <em>de novo </em>on the record. We concur in the legal and factual findings below, as well as the determination of the guilt of each of the defendants of contempt of court beyond a reasonable doubt. The record clearly establishes that defendants each had notice of the wrongful diversion of the funds approximately 36 hours before the November 17, 1972 court hearing and were authorized by their clients to disclose the same at least 24 hours before that hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number><em>\u25a0 </em>Further, upon the whole record, we agree with the sentence imposed on each by the trial court and those sentences are herewith incorporated bjr reference into this determination. See <em>Bd. of Ed. of Newark v. Newark Teachers </em>Union, 114 <em>N. J. Super. </em>306, 316, 318 (App. Div. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
