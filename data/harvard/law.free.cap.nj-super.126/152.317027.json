Judgment was entered directing defendant to dismiss the pending actions and enjoining it from instituting any further civil actions for the recovery of alleged overpayments, except as specifically authorized by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">The judgment is affirmed essentially for the reasons expressed in the opinion of Judge Wood in the court below. 123 <em>N.
