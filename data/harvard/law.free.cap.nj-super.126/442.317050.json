J. 8. A. </em>2A:98-1 and 2); (2) misconduct in office <em>(N. J. 8. A. </em>2A:85-1 and 14); and (3) extortion <em>(N. J. 8. A. </em>2A :105 \u2014 1 and <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>2A:85-14). The trial commenced on April 20, 1972 and concluded on April 27, 1972. On April 25, 1972, the prosecutor moved to dismiss the charges against Kramer, and for an order compelling Kramer\u2019s testimony under our immunity statute. Both motions were granted. A subsequent motion for a mistrial based on these rulings was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">The trial thereafter proceeded against defendant alone, with Kramer testifying on behalf of the State. The jury, after deliberation, found defendant guilty of the first and second charges and acquitted him of the third charge \u2014 extortion. Defendant was thereafter sentenced to two concurrent one to three year sentences in State Prison, Trenton, with all but 12 months of the sentences suspended, the court directing that defendant serve a custodial term of 12 months in the Mercer County Work House.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Defendant first argues on appeal that the verdicts were against the weight of the evidence. However, as he subsequently recognized and acknowledged in his reply brief, his argument was based on the erroneous assumption that <em>State v. Donohue, </em>2 <em>N. J. </em>381 (1949) still controlled our law applicable to circumstantial evidence. See <em>State v. Mayberry, et al., </em>52 <em>N. J. </em>413 (1968), <em>cert. </em>den. 393 <em>U. S. </em>1043, 89 S. Ct. 673, 21 L. Ed. 2d 593 (1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">Defendant next argues that the severance of his co-defendant in mid-trial and the subsequent grant of immunity was so prejudicial that a mistrial should have been declared by the trial judge. It is defendant\u2019s theory that the prosecutor knew all along that certain statements given by Kramer would be inadmissible at the trial. We find that the record fails to support the theory of defendant which presupposes that plaintiff unfairly used Kramer in an at<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>tempt to influence the jury. There is no other showing of prejudice. In addition, we note that the trial judge emphasized during his charge that there was no significance to be drawn by the jurors from the dismissal of the charges against Kramer and, further, that the granting of immunity did not lend weight to Kramer\u2019s credibility. Compare <em>State v. Provoid, </em>110 <em>N. J. Super. </em>547 (App. Div. 1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Defendant also contends that he was prejudiced by the failure of the trial judge to have the reading of certain testimony completed before the jurors resumed deliberations. After deliberating for several hours the jury raised two questions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-6\">(1) Did this indictment come from the complaint made by Saperstein ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-7\">(2) Did Kramer and Saperstein both agree to the meeting in September ?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">The trial judge properly termed the answer to the first question immaterial. In answering the second question, the judge properly told the jurors that it would be improper for him to give them his recollection. The foreman then stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-9\">Your Honor, I feel it is advisable if we can hear the testimony again of the two witnesses.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-10\">At this point, the testimony of Saperstein was reread. The physical act of reading was performed by the court reporter who sat in the witness box and read from his notes. No other court reporter was present at the time to take down what he read. During the reading, the jurors\u2019 dinner arrived, and at the conclusion of the reading of Saperstein\u2019s testimony the jurors were informed by the trial judge that dinner was waiting for them. At that point, the foreman and possibly several of the jurors indicatel to the court that they had heard all that they had wanted to hear. Unfortunately, this colloquy between the foreman and the trial judge took place <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>while the court reporter was sitting in the witness box, with the result that it was not taken down as part of the record. No objeci\u00f3n was thereafter made by either side.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">At the original argument in this ease we were led to believe that the jurors were permitted to retire for dinner after the conclusion of the reading of the Saperstein testimony but with the expectation by the parties that the reading of Kramer\u2019s testimony would be conducted after dinner. Eor some reason unexplained on the record, we believed the failure to read Kramer\u2019s testimony was overlooked. We noted in our original opinion that \u201cThe record does not disclose that any objection was made either before or after the verdict by defendant; nor was the failure to read Kramer\u2019s testimony raised as a ground on the motion for a new trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Aya\">After our original opinion and the dissenting opinion of our brother Crahay were filed, we received a letter from Judge Sehoch who tried the case below, advising us of the facts surrounding the reading of the testimony, as we have outlined them above. Counsel were provided with copies of Judge Schoch\u2019s letter and given the opportunity to present their views thereon in writing. We thereafter permitted re-argument of this issue. We have concluded that the facts as set forth in Judge Schoch\u2019s letter, and as incorporated in this opinion, accurately set forth what actually occurred during the rereading of the testimony, even accepting as true the statement by defendant\u2019s trial counsel with respect to what defendant now urges is a critical aspect of the case, that his counsel\u2019s \u201cpresent recollection * * * is not sufficiently adequate to permit [him] to either affirm or disavow the narrative thereof set forth by Judge Schoch therein.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\"> The rules governing the reading of testimony at the jury\u2019s request are set forth in <em>State v. </em>Wolf, 44 <em>N. J. </em>176, 185-186 (1965). See also, <em>State v. Wilkerson, </em>60 <em>N. J. </em>452, 460 (1972). The rule simply stated provides that the grant of such a request is in the discretion of the trial judge, but that the judge should readily accede when the jurors request to hear testimony read, absent some unusual circumstances. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>Hero, Judge Schoch did accede to the jurors\u2019 request. The reading was not completed because the jurors requested that it be terminated, even though all of the testimony originally requested to be read had not been read. We find nothing in <em>Wolf </em>or <em>Wilkerson, </em>above, which requires a trial judge to continue the reading of testimony commenced at the jurors\u2019 request after the jurors asked that the reading be terminated, particularly where, as here, defendant offered no objection and did not ask that the reading be continued and thus acquiesced in the jurors\u2019 request that it be terminated. Defendant may not fairly now seek to recall his acquiescence in the jurors\u2019 request. The failure to read Kramer\u2019s testimony to the jurors affords no basis or justification for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">Apposite is what the court said in <em>State v. Macon, </em>57 <em>N. J. </em>325, 333-334 (1971) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b467-6\">* * * It is fundamental in our practice that a claim of error which could have been but was not raised at trial will not be dealt with as would be a timely challenge. The reasons are several. It may be fair to infer from the failure to object below that in the context of the trial the error was actually of no moment. Further, to rerun a trial when the error could easily have been cured on request, would reward the litigant who suffers an error for tactical advantage either in the trial or on appeal. *\u25a0 * * In any event, except in extraordinary circumstances, a claim of error will not be entertained unless it is perfectly clear that there actually was error. In other words, if upon a timely objection a different or further record might have been made at the trial level, and the claim of error might thereby have been dissipated, we will neither reverse on an assumption that there was error nor remand the matter io explore that possibility. * * * These principles rest upon the belief that our practice offers every opportunity for a fair trial, and that unless there is some order in the trial of cases, the State judiciary cannot hope to meet the swollen demands upon it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-7\"> Defendant\u2019s last two arguments, that the prosecuting witness should have been forced to produce his income tax returns from 1966 to 1971 \u201cto show what triggered this whole thing was an investigation by Internal Eevenue Service,\u201d and that the use of a tape recording during defendant\u2019s cross-examination of a conversation of an interview between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>defendant and the prosecutor, taped without his knowledge, we find to be without merit.' With respect to the first of these arguments, we agree with the State that the Internal Revenue investigation in no manner figured in the prosecution, and that the basis asserted was not stated at trial. As to the second, the use of the tape was proper during cross-examination. <em>Harris v. New York, </em>401 <em>U. S. </em>222, 91 S. Ct. 643, 28 L. Ed. 2d 1 (1971). The wire tapping statute is inapplicable. <em>State v. </em>Vizzini, 115 <em>N. J. Super. </em>97 (App. Div. 1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">The judgments of conviction are affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b468-5\">Crahay, J. A. D.,</author>\n<p id=\"AdZ\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">I would reverse on the ground that the trial court\u2019s failure, in this case, to read all rather than a portion of testimony specifically requested by the jury amounted to a seriously prejudicial abuse of discretion. <em>State v. </em>Wolf, 44 <em>N. J. </em>176 (1965).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">The case was close, and I cannot say beyond a reasonable doubt that' the error, be it plain or otherwise, did not have a tendency to mislead the jury to a result it otherwise might not have reached. The failure to satisfy the jury\u2019s specific request to read critical testimony generated not only a real but a strong possibility of injustice. <em>State v. </em>Macon, 57 <em>N. J. </em>325 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">Defendant and one George Kramer were indicted for conspiracy to commit misconduct in office contrary to <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:98-1 and 2. Additionally, the defendant was charged with misconduct in office contrary to <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:85-1 and extortion contrary to <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:105-1. Kramer was charged with aiding and abetting defendant in the latter two offenses contrary to <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:85-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-9\">After the trial had proceeded into its fourth day the prosecution elected to dismiss the charges against Kramer and procured an order compelling him to testify against Garrigan under the New Jersey Immunity Statute <em>(N. J. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number><em>8. A. </em>2A:81-17.3). As the trial court noted, the essential witnesses against defendant were Kramer and Jacob Saperstein. Except for Kramer\u2019s testimony, the case was essentially \u201cone on one\u201d as between Saperstein and defendant. Saperstein asserted that some six years earlier he gave $1500 to Kramer to give to Garrigan in return for a governmental favor; \u2014 expeditious payment of Urban Renewal relocation expenses. Garrigan categorically denied the payment and other wrongdoings.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-5\">Saperstein testified that on September 16, 1966 he gave Kramer the $1500 involved. He had procured the $1500 by drawing a check to cash against an account in the name of his business and then endorsed it \u201cJacob Saperstein\u201d indicating in the checkbook that it was for \u201ccash for back pay \u2014 \u2022 Jack and Sam Saperstein \u2014 $1500 \u2022 \u2014 \u25a0 September 16, 1966.\u201d Kramer denied receiving any money from Saperstein or giving any to Garrigan. Defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence then turned solely on who was to be believed, \u2014 Saperstein, Garrigan or Kramer, to the extent that the latter denied receiving money from Saperstein or giving it to Garrigan. As noted earlier, in my view, the case was \u201cclose\u201d. The trial court indeed in ruling on post-trial defense motions stated, after finding that there was enough evidence for jury consideration, \u2014 \u201cThis whole case is built on a limited amount of evidence . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b469-6\">Testimony during the trial was taken over five days and the jurors were given the court\u2019s instructions and began deliberations at 10:20 a.m. on the sixth day. At about 3:30 in the afternoon the court received two notes from the jury. The first stated that they could not come to a unanimous decision on the first two counts of the indictment. Ten minutes later a note asking the court to \u201cgive an explanation of the first two counts of the indictment\u201d. Assuming the second note to have superseded the first, the court recharged at considerable length on the elements of conspiracy and misconduct in office. At 6 :05 p.m. the jury again returned to the courtroom. The court first advised them that their dinner had been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"450\">*450</page-number>ordered. Then in response to a question in the jury\u2019s note, \u201cDid this indictment come from the complaint made by Saperstein?\u201d, the court, as the majority notes, properly ruled the question immaterial. (Saperstein had, in fact, first related his version of the alleged transactions to the Prosecutor\u2019s office on August 3, 197T, almost five years later.)</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">A second question was addressed to the court \u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-5\"><em>Did Kramer and Saperstein both agree to the meeting in September? </em>(Emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">The court answered that it would be improper for him to give his recollection of the testimony. He told the jury that if they wanted a portion of the testimony read back \u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-7\"><em>... we will have it read baeh </em>... <em>So if you want Mr. Kramer\u2019s testimony read baeh for instance, we\u2019ll have it read baeh. If you want Mr. Saperstein\u2019s read bach, we\u2019ll have that read bach. </em>If you think that\u2019s necessary . . . (emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">The foreman then responded, \u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-9\"><em>Your Honor, I feel it advisable if we hear the testimony again of the two loitnesses. </em>(emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b470-10\">The court after asking if anyone did not agree with a reading,. ordered it.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-11\">Saperstein\u2019s testimony was read, according to the record, until 7:03 p.m. at which point the court stated, \u201cWe have ordered dinner but it won\u2019t get here for another ten minutes. All right, you. may retire.\u201d The jury thereupon left the courtroom \u201cto resume its deliberations.\u201d Prosecution and defense counsel neither made objection nor observation on the failure to read Kramer\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-12\">At 8:45 p.m. the jury announced its verdict finding defendant gnilty of conspiracy and misconduct and not guilty of extortion.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>Saperstein\u2019s testimony covered 57 pages of the trial transcript, reciting dealings with defendant and others and detailing meetings with Kramer including the one at which he allegedly turned over the $1500 cash to be given to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Kramer\u2019s testimony covered but five pages of the transcript. In substance he testified that he knew the defendant twelve or thirteen years and Saperstein approximately fifty years, that Garrigan called him and asked him to stop and see Saperstein and have Saperstein \u201ccall him up\u201d, that he-conveyed the message and sometime later passed Saperstein! on the street in his truck calling from the truck, asking whether or not he had called Garrigan. He specifically denied receiving any money from Saperstein or giving any to Garrigan.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">Inexplicably, the jury did not have this critical testimony read back to them. We could not elicit any reason at oral argument, nor does the record enlighten on the failure except insofar as we are told that the jury\u2019s dinner was on the way.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\"><em>State v. </em>Wolf, supra, pronounces at p. 185 \u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-8\">It should be remembered that the reading of all or part of the testimony of one or more of the witnesses at a trial, criminal or civil, at the specific request of the jury during their deliberations is discretionary with the trial court . . . When a jury retires to consider their verdict, their discussion may produce disagreement or failure' or doubt of definite recollection as to what a particular witness said in the course of his testimony. <em>If they request enlightenment on the subject, through a reading of his testimony, in the absence of some unusual ciretuu stance, the request should be granted. </em>The true administration of justice calls for such action. AVhere there is a doubt in the minds of jurors as to what a witness said, it cannot be prejudicial to anyone to have that doubt removed by a rehearing of his testimony. There is no need to be chary for fear of giving undue prominence to the testimony of the witness. If under our system of trials a jury is to he considered intelligent enough to be entrusted with powers of decision, it must be assumed they have sense enough 1o ask to have their memories stimulated or refreshed only as to those portions of the testimony about which they are in doubt or disagreement. It must be assumed also that if they had any similar <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>doubts or disagreements about statements of other witnesses they would seek the same remedy . . . But generally where the testimony is reasonably available, a judge should not refuse to grant a jury request to have it read merely because the reading would take time. In these days when the purpose of our procedure is full, fair and free exposure to all relevant evidence in a ease both before and during the trial, there is no just reason for insisting that laymen jurors must have an unfailing and unanimous memory of all the testimony they hear in the courtroom . . . (emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">Here, then, the trial court recognized the direction in which his discretion was to be employed under <em>State v. </em>Wolf, supra, but having undertaken to satisfy the jury\u2019s specific inquiry neglected to complete it. I equate \u201cneglect\u201d with \u201crefusal\u201d in relating the omission here with that in <em>Wolf.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">The principle has been restated in <em>State v. </em>Wilkerson, 60 <em>N. J. 452 </em>at p. 460, (1972) where the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b472-6\">Normally a trial court, which has ultimate discretion in the matter, should <em>readily accede </em>to any request by a jury to have any particular testimony read to it during deliberations, (emphasis added)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-7\"><em>State v. </em>Kuske, 109 <em>N. J. Super. </em>275 (App. Div. 1970) and <em>State v. </em>Cox, 101 <em>N. J. Super. </em>470, 480 (App. Div. 1968), certif den. 53 <em>N. J. </em>510 (1969) are readily distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">In <em>State v. </em>Kuske, <em>supra, </em>the trial court failed to furnish all of the information requested by the jury. The Appellate Division felt in that case it was not prejudicial although it questioned the failure of the judge to honor the jury\u2019s request in full. The court there noted that the guilt of the defendant was convincingly established by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">In <em>State v. </em>Cox, supra, we found no abuse of the trial court\u2019s discretion nor any prejudice in failing to read all of a State\u2019s witness\u2019s testimony, since the jury indicated that it had heard enough.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-10\">In <em>United States v. Rabb, </em>453 <em>F. </em>2d 1012 (3d Cir. 1971) the defendant was convicted of bank robbery. The jury after two hours deliberation requested the reading of the testimony of two witnesses. The Court refused and instead read its sum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"453\">*453</page-number>mary of the testimony. Defense counsel objected to the procedure. Approximately forty pages of transcript were involved. Becognizing that such requests were within the discretion of the trial judge, the Court stated the rationale behind the refusal on the part of trial judges to allow a reading of a portion of the testimony. It was held to be twofold, 1) that the request might tend to slow the trial and 2) that the reading of only one portion might cause the jury to give the portion read undue emphasis. It was held in <em>Rail </em>that the rationale was not operative. At p. 1014 \u2022\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-5\">... It must be assumed that the jury asked for a reading of this testimony because it was in doubt or in disagreement upon its proper evaluation [and further] . . . the evidence on which the jury wanted guidance was crucial to its verdict . . .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">The Court there found that the testimony went . . to the very heart of the case,\u201d and that the testimony was \u201c. . . not unduly long . . .\u201d In reversing for an abuse of discretion the Court noted that its decision was supported by the Standards Relating to the Trial by Jury <em>(ABA Project on Minimal Standards of Criminal Justice) </em>Sec. 5.2 and Commentary at 134-38 (Approved Draft 1968) :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b473-7\">5.2 Jury request to review evidence (a) If the jury, after retiring for deliberation, requests a review of certain testimony or other evidence, they shall be conducted to the courtroom. Whenever the jury\u2019s request is reasonable, the court, after notice to the prosecutor and counsel for the defense, shall have the requested parts of the testimony read to the jury and shall permit the jury to reexamine the requested materials admitted into evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">In a concurring opinion in Ball, Judge Aldisert stated that he was not ready to subscribe to the unrestricted use of the ABA standard. I am of the same view and would have each case be its own barometer to measure whether a trial court\u2019s discretion was properly employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-9\">In <em>U. S. v. Jackson, </em>257 <em>F. </em>2d 41 (3d Cir. 1958) a narcotics conviction was reversed. The jury had asked a specific <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"454\">*454</page-number>\u25a0question and while the court and counsel were mulling whether or not to read portions of the transcript to it and by the time the court had decided that it would cause a portion of the transcript to be read to them, the jury announced its verdict of guilt. In answer to a question from the Judge, the foreman before announcing the verdict declared that they no longer needed an answer to their earlier question.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">At p. 43 \u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b474-5\">. . . we think that the failure to permit the reading of the relevant testimony at a time when it would have been useful in the jury\u2019s deliberations created unfairness to the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-6\"><em>See also </em>Annot., 50 A. L. R. 2d 176 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">In this case, if the trial court had denied the jury\u2019s request for the reading of Saperstein\u2019s and Kramer\u2019s testimony, <em>Wolf </em>would have been fully operative. In my view, it was far more damaging here to have read only Saperstein\u2019s when Kramer\u2019s testimony probably would have generated \u25a0consideration by them not only as to substantive matters, i. e. the meetings between Kramer and Saperstein, but might very readily have produced credibility considerations which could have undermined Saperstein\u2019s version of the involved matters. Kramer\u2019s testimony was not cumulative. A reading would have taken but minutes. The jury specifically requested it.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">The majority finds it highly significant that defense counsel did not object to the procedure during the reading. (Neither did the prosecutor even though Kramer was his witness, albeit not helpful). I feel, that once communication is undertaken between a jury and a court, the trial judge becomes the captain of the ship and is obligated to follow through in meeting the juror\u2019s needs during the critical moments (or hours) of deliberation. Our inability to assess fault for the failure to honor the jury\u2019s request does not soften the impact of <em>Wolf, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"455\">*455</page-number>If either counsel had addressed the court, the omission to read Kramer\u2019s testimony might have been averted. I am not aware of any authority which requires defense counsel\u2019s objection called for by the majority. If there be such a requirement, I would then nonetheless find plain error. <em>State v. Macon, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">The majority also notes that the jurors did not notify the trial judge that they desired the reading to continue. True enough. But they did specifically request it. See <em>U. S. v. Jackson, supra. </em>One might opine that \u201cdinner\u201d blinded all to the omission. In a similar vein the State in its brief, referring to the \u201ccourt reporter\u2019s omission\u201d, urges that the jury was apparently satisfied with hearing only Saperstein\u2019s testimony. If this indeed was the fact, then in view of the jury\u2019s request and the conflicting testimony the harm to defendant was escalated.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">Here, where the proof of guilt was not clear or strong, I would find that the trial court\u2019s omission constituted an error of magnitude with a heavy potential to affect the jury verdict, <em>State v. LaPorte, </em>62 <em>N. J. </em>312 (1973), and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">ON PETITION EOR REHEARING</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">In response to the majority per curiam opinion affirming defendant\u2019s conviction, I filed the above dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">Thereafter on April 23, 1973, pursuant to <em>R. </em>2:11-6, the prosecutor by verified petition sought a rehearing and summary redetermination of the appeal with the aim, I suppose, of causing the dissenting opinion to be withdrawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-10\">In support of the petition we have been supplied with affidavits by the prosecutor who tried the case and the Acting Chief of County Detectives who was in charge of its investigation. Contemporaneously, the trial judge advised us by letter of his recollection of what occurred during the testimonial re-reading.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-11\">The prosecutor\u2019s recollection was that the court reporter took the witness stand to re-read the testimony and that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"456\">*456</page-number><em>prior </em>to completing Saperstein\u2019s testimony the jury foreman indicated that the reporter had read enough and that it would not be necessary to read further. At this point, according to the prosecutor\u2019s recollection, the trial court asked the other jurors if they were satisfied and that they <em>all </em>nodded in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">The Chief of County Detective\u2019s recollection was substantially similar to the prosecutor\u2019s and that \u2022\u2014</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-5\">It is my recollection that at no time was the testimony stopped because of the arrival of dinner but rather the Foreman of the Jury indicated to the court that sufficient testimony of Saperstein had been read . . . and the Court asked the other jurors if that was satisfactory and they answered in the affirmative.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">(The transcript of the trial indicates that the reporter, \u201cread the testimony of Mr. Saperstein,\u201d without interruption, and that the \u201cdinner announcement\u201d followed it.)</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">At the oral argument on the hearing, we solicited from the prosecutor at what point he recalled Saperstein\u2019s testimony being ended. His recollection then was that it was after the discussion of Saperstein\u2019s second meeting with Kramer <em>i. e. </em>at the time he picked up the check for $1,500. The trial record reflects that this occurred at a very early point in Saperstein\u2019s testimony. It does not square with the trial transcript which, as noted in the dissenting opinion, reflects that the jury returned for additional instructions at 6 :05 p.m. and that the reading of the Saperstein testimony concluded at 7:03 p.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">Defendant\u2019s trial counsel, by affidavit, in response to the petition, disclaims present recollection of the events sufficient for him to affirm or disavow what occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">As noted, the trial judge submitted a letter dated April 24, 1973 outlining his recollection of the proceedings. Contrary to the State\u2019s position, his recollection is that at the <em>conclusion </em>of Saperstein\u2019s testimony the jurors were informed that dinner was awaiting them and that at that point, at least the foreman and <em>possibly </em>several of the jurors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>indicated that they had heard what they wanted to hear. The trial judge advises us that the colloquy took place while the court reporter was in the witness box and therefore no record was made of the goings on. In view of the indication by the jury that they had heard enough the trial judge advises us that he did not cause Kramer\u2019s testimony to be reread.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-6\">I join with my brothers in the majority opinion insofar as they accept the trial court\u2019s recollection of the events as the most probable \u2014' the record tends to support it \u25a0\u2014 but I am still not persuaded that defendant had a full and fair trial. If some of the jurors were satisfied with hearing again Saperstein, without Kramer\u2019s flat contradictions, then the questions addressed to the trial court by the foreman on the nature and extent of the meetings between Kramer and Saperstein were but partially \u2014 and perilously for Garrigan \u2014 answered. I am not satisfied that <em>State v. Cox, </em>107 <em>N. J. Super. </em>470 (App. Div. 1968), certif. den. 53 <em>N. J. </em>510 (1969) is operative on this record. In <em>Cox </em>this Division specifically found that it could not perceive how the defendant there was prejudiced by the omission to read the entire testimony sought by the jury. I accept <em>Cox </em>but now reiterate, the thoughts in my dissent that in a case as close as this, I, plainly and simply, cannot find beyond a reasonable doubt that there was no prejudice of reversible magnitude. <em>See again, U. S. v. Rabb, </em>453 <em>F. </em>2d 1012 (3d Cir. 1971); <em>U. S. v. Jackson, </em>257 <em>F. </em>2d 41 (3d Cir. 1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b477-7\">I am not persuaded, even if the record stands supplemented, that it warrants a withdrawal of my dissent and accordingly I maintain it and vote to reverse the conviction.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
