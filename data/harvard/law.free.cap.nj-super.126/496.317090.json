A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"Arn\">The issue in this case is whether appellant Joule Technical Corporation (Joule) is engaged in the business of an \u201celectrical contractor,\u201d within the meaning of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>45:5A-1 <em>et seq., </em>which requires anyone engaged in such business to obtain a license from the Board of Examiners of Electrical Contractors (Board). <em>N. J. S. A. </em>45:5A-9. Joule contends that it is not engaged in such business and needs no license from the Board to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-12\">On August 24, 1972 the Board, after a hearing, rendered a decision reaffirming a previous determination by it that Joule was engaged in the business of electrical contracting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>and imposed a penalty of \u00cd^OO.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Joule appealed to this court which, pursuant to an unreported <em>per curiam </em>opinion of May 18, 1973, remanded the matter to the Board for a full hearing, with directions that it make express findings of fact as to the nature of Joule\u2019s operation, and conclusions of law. We retained jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">A hearing was held before the Board\u2019s hearing officer, who thereafter filed findings of fact, conclusions, and recommendations. He recommended that the Board rescind its previous decision that Joule was an \u201celectrical contractor\u201d and remit any fines collected. Upon review the Board rejected the hearing officer\u2019s recommendation and reaffirmed its previous position. That determination is now before us for decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">In making his findings of fact, the hearing officer accepted the testimony which was uncontradicted and which generally described Joule\u2019s operation as follows. It hired out temporary employees, including electricians, to companies which needed them as \u201cfill-ins\u201d on a temporary basis. The incident which gave rise to this proceeding involved Joule\u2019s providing an electrician to Celanese Corporation. The employee was on Joule\u2019s payroll but under the complete supervision of Celanese. After the employee\u2019s payroll taxes and fringe benefits, as well as Joule\u2019s overhead and profit, were deducted, the em-, ployee received the remainder.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">The hearing officer concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b518-7\">It is clear from the evidence adduced at this hearing that [Joule] was not in the business of being an electrical contractor, rather they were in the business of supplying manpower on an hourly basis for industries\u2019 temporary needs. Modern industry has a need from time to time for fill-ins or temporary help, both technical and otherwise. Service companies spring up to supply this need, and Joule Technical Corporation is just one such company.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>The Board, after reviewing the transcript of the hearing and considering the hearing officer\u2019s recommendations, made its own \u201cFindings of Fact.\u201d In their entirety they were stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">FINDINGS OF FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">1. Between April and October, 1971, Joule Technical Corporation entered into a contract or contracts to supply Celanese with an electrician.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">2. Said electrician, one W. Dmytreshin, performed various duties in connection with the maintenance of electrical facilities at the Celanese plants located in Clark and Summit, New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">3. Mr. Dmytreshin performed such electrical work without the supervision of a licensed electrical contractor, nor is he [sic] a regular employee of Celanese who is a qualified journeyman electrician.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">The Board concluded that the facts thus found established Joule as an \u201celectrical contractor\u201d within the statutory definition thereof contained in <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>45:5A-2(d). That definition reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-10\">\u201cElectrical contractor\u201d means a person who engages in the business of contracting to install, erect, repair or alter electrical equipment for the generation, transmission or utilization of electrical energy;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-11\">Was Joule, then, \u201ccontracting\u201d to install, erect or repair electrical equipment when it hires out an electrician as a \u201cfill-in\u201d to another company?</p>\n<p id=\"b519-12\"><em>Websiers\u2019 New International Dictionary of the English Language </em>(2d ed. 1950), 579, defines \u201ccontractor\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-13\">One who contracts; a party to a bargain; one who formally undertakes to do anything for another; specif., one who contracts to perform work, or supply articles on a large scale, at a certain price or rate, as in building houses or provisioning troops. Such a contractor specializing in a [specified] material or type of work, as in:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ai9\">\n<em>advertisement coal contractor road contractor</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATY\">\n<em>contractor stone contractor timber contractor</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-15\">For a person to come within the statutory definition of \u201ccontractor,\u201d it is clear that <em>he </em>must be undertaking to do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>the work. It is also evident that, if he engages someone (as an electrician) to do it, the alleged \u201ccontractor\u201d is not himself undertaking to do the work unless the person he engages (the electrician) is his servant or agent. Conversely, if that person is not the alleged \u201ccontractor\u2019s\u201d servant or agent but the work as the servant or agent of the company to whom he is hired out (here Celanese), then the latter (vicariously through the hired electrician), is doing the work and the alleged \u201ccontractor\u201d has not undertaken to do it.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\">When a servant is directed or permitted by his master.to perform services for another, he may become the servant of such other. The question of whether the general employer, or the special employer, is the master turns largely upon the decision as to who has the right to exercise control over the servant. <em>Younkers v. Ocean County, </em>130 <em>N. J. L. </em>607, 608 (E. &amp; A. 1943). We are not unmindful of differences of opinion as to the influence of the \u201cright of control\u201d test in determining a master and servant relationship, and that, indeed, it depends upon whether the issue involves liability to third persons, or liability of the employer to employee or other considerations. See concurring opinion by Judge Schettino in <em>Devone v. Newark Tidewater Terminal, Inc., </em>14 <em>N. J. Super. </em>401, 406 (1951) (concurring opinion). True, the \u201cright of control\u201d standard is not the sole test of the master and servant relationship, but it is the1 predominant one. See <em>Falk v. Unger, </em>33 <em>N. J. Super. </em>589 (App. Div. 1955). So too, in <em>Devone v. Newark Tidewater Terminal, Inc., supra, </em>the majority opinion recognized the \u201ccontrol\u201d test as \u201cnot merely the important one, but decisive\u201d and the law of Eew Jersey. 14 <em>N. J. Super. </em>at 405.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">We are aware that, in <em>Viggiano v. Reppenhagen, </em>55 <em>N. J. Super. </em>114 (App. Div. 1959), where defendant rented a car and driver to another and the driver struck and injured one of the rentee\u2019s employees, it was held that the driver remained defendant\u2019s master so as to hold it vicariously liable for the injuries. The court pointed out that the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>was in the regular business of renting trucks, it had full control over the mechanical fitness of the vehicle, and while driving the truck the driver was furthering the interest of his employer. While it may be argued that <em>Viggiano </em>is applicable here, we find it distinguishable. In <em>Viggiano </em>the control of the truck or its driver in the operation of the vehicle did not pass to the rentee as did the control of the electrician to Celanese here.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">As the tests of master and servant relationship may vary depending upon the nature of the issue here (Judge Schettino\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>Devone, supra), </em>in the construction of the instant statute, <em>i. e., </em>whether Joule is in the business of an \u201celectrical contractor,\u201d we conclude that the \u201ccontrol\u201d test is the logically determinative one in demonstrating that Joule is not undertaking \u201cto do\u201d the electrical work in sending an electrician to Celanese.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">By way of illustrating application of the relevant principles as to master and servant, <em>Restatement, Agency </em>2d (1958), \u00a7 227, gives the following example:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-7\">3. P, a master carpenter, by agreement with B, sends A, a skilled cabinetmaker, to work with B\u2019s servants for a week, under the direction of B\u2019s foreman, in the reconstruction of a stairway. For this B is to pay P an agreed amount. A acts as the servant of B in building the stairway, [at 502]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">That example fits here. Joule would be \u201cP,\u201d \u201cB\u201d Celanese, and \u201cA\u201d the electrician sent by Joule to Celanese.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">California\u2019s Business and Professions Code provides that a \u201ccontractor\u201d may not bring an action for compensation unless he is duly licensed. Thus the question arises as to whether one is a \u201ccontractor\u201d and, if unlicensed, barred from such a suit. In <em>Dahl-Beck Electric Co. v. Rogge, </em>275 <em>Cal. App. 2d </em>893, 80 Cal. Rptr. 440 (D. Ct. App. 1969), plaintiff, an electrical contractor, was performing work on a job pursuant to contract, and needed a backhoe for trench-digging. Plaintiff contacted defendant Rogge who sent defendant Stratford and the backhoe to the jobsite. The rate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>agreed to be paid to Rogge by Dahl-Beck was $14 an hour for providing one man and the backhoe. Stratford was paid by Rogge on the basis of the time spent on the backhoe. Stratford reported to Albright, foreman of plaintiff Dahl-Beck. Albright directed Stratford as to where and how far to dig the trench, and told him to be careful because there were pipes and a water main in the area. During the digging a water main was damaged and plaintiff was required to make emergency repairs. Dahl-Beck started a suit to recover the cost of those repairs but did not pay Rogge for the work done by Stratford. Rogge cross-complained for $1,215 for services performed. Relevant here is the question in that case as to whether Rogge was a \u201ccontractor\u201d under the California statute. If he was, being unlicensed, he would be barred from recovery. The jury, after instructions on the issue, held that Rogge was not a \u201ccontractor.\u201d The court, on appeal,. observing that the evidence indicated that Stratford acted on direction of Albright, plaintiff\u2019s foreman, and</p>\n<p id=\"AcD\">that there was no evidence of supervision by Rogge, held that it was proper to submit the issue to the jury. The court cited, among other cases, that of <em>Rodoni v. Harbor Engineers, </em>191 <em>Cal. App. 2d </em>560, 12 <em>Cal. Rptr. </em>924 (D. Ct. App. 1961). There plaintiff testified that he was in the business of renting equipment and hiring out drivers. Payment for equipment and men was made on an hourly basis and plaintiff had nothing to do with the supervision of the work. It was held that plaintiff was entitled to recover, that he was not a \u201ccontractor,\u201d and the fact that he listed himself as \u201ccontractor\u201d only raised a conflict in the evidence. See other cases cited in <em>Dahl-Beck, </em>80 <em>Cal. Rptr. </em>at 445, particularly <em>Andrew v. Conner, </em>101 <em>Cal. App. 2d </em>621, 225 P. 2d 943 (D. Ct. App. 1951), where the lienor\u2019s sole participation was rental of men and equipment to lienee who supervised, directed and controlled the work. There, too, the lienor was held not to be a \u201ccontractor\u201d and, though unlicensed, was not barred from recovering his compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>We recognize that in .the cited California cases the issue as to whether plaintiff (or cross-claimant Rogge in <em>Dahl-BecTc), </em>was a \u201ccontractor\u201d was said to be determined by the factfinder \u2014\u25a0 jury or judge sitting without a jury. So too, in our State, questions of agency or master and servant relationships are ordinarily for the jury. But jury questions are presented only where there are disputed facts or where disputed inferences may be drawn from undisputed facts. <em>Marion v. Public Service Elec. &amp; Gas Co., </em>72 <em>N. J. Super. </em>146, 157-158 (App. Div. 1962). And where the evidence is uncontradicted and permits but one reasonable conclusion as to an issue of agency, that issue is a question of law for the court and not for the finder of fact. <em>Harvey v. Craw, </em>110 <em>N. J. Super. </em>68, 74-75 (App. Div.), certif. den. 56 <em>N. J. </em>479 (1970); <em>Collins v. Ames, </em>98 <em>N. J. L. </em>828 (E. <em>&amp; </em>A. 1923); <em>Scherer v. Post Office B. &amp; L. Ass\u2019n, </em>91 <em>N. J. L. </em>666 (E. &amp; A. 1917).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">We consider it significant that the Board\u2019s \u201cFindings of Fact\u201d below \u2014\u25a0 as distinguished from those of the hearing officer \u2014 made no determination of the issue as to whether the electrician was under the direction and control of Celanese in doing his work.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Here the evidence is uncontradicted that the electrician hired out to Celanese was completely under the direction and supervision of Celanese. We so find, as fact and law. There was no evidence that there was any such control by Joule. <em>Cf. </em>Dahl-Beck <em>vis-a-vis </em>Rogge. It follows that Joule was not, absent any other evidence to the contrary (per principles of <em>respondeat </em>superior), \u201cdoing\u201d the work at Celanese, nor had it contracted to do it. The electrician was the employee of Celanese as he acted under its direction and control.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">In support of its decision below, the Board cites <em>Bd. of Examiners v. S. T. Peterson &amp; Co., Inc., </em>106 <em>N. J. Super. </em>599 (App. Div. 1969), and <em>Ind. Elec. Ass\u2019n of N. J. v. N. J. Bd. of Exam., </em>54 <em>N. J. </em>466 (1969). Neither case is apposite here. <em>S. T. Peterson </em>held that a general contractor who did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>electrical work only as incidental to his general maintenance work was an \u201celectrical contractor.\u201d As the court stated, the work was done \u201cby defendant\u2019s electricians.\u201d 106 <em>N. J. Super. </em>at 601. In fact the court expressly said \u201cthe electricians are not employees of Shell.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 603. There was no indication that they were under Shell\u2019s direction and control. The evidence here demonstrates uncontrovertibly that the electrician was solely under the control of Celanese. <em>S. T. Peterson </em>went on to hold that the contractor was not exempt under section 18 (k) of the act, a consideration not relevant here.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\"><em>Ind. Elec. Ass\u2019n of N. J. </em>merely upheld the constitutionality of the instant statute and had nothing whatever to do with the master and servant issue here involved. The Board cites it principally in support of the motivating objectives of safety with respect to supervision of electricians contemplated by the act. But the case is no authority whatever for bringing Joule within the term \u201celectrical-contractor\u201d if he is not, as we hold. The same objective of safety by supervision might be said to apply to a developer-contractor who does electrical work in construction of homes owned by him and intended for resale, and that therefore he too is an \u201celectrical contractor\u201d within the meaning of the statute. But in <em>Sands v. Bd. of Examiners of Electrical </em>Contractors, 90 <em>N. J. Super. </em>82 (App. Div. 1966), this court held that such a person was not an \u201celectrical contractor.\u201d The court rested its decision on fundamental rules of statutory construction that words of a statute are to be given their ordinary meaning, and that such meaning is particularly important where the statute contains penal provisions, for it is not to be presumed that the Legislature intended punishment to extend further than expressly stated. In <em>Sands </em>the court held that it would not stretch the statutory language to cover the builder when he was not covered by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">So here. We conclude that Joule was not an \u201celectrical contractor\u201d within the meaning of the statute, as decided by the Board. Its decision to that effect is reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b518-8\">The Board later conceded that it had no power to assess such a penalty and that its right to recover a penalty was limited to institution of a civil action therefor. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>45:5A-20. This question is not now material here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
