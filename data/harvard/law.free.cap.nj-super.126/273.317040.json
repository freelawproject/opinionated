The husband deserted her and their children shortly thereafter. Appellant claims that she called the Essex County Welfare Board concerning her nonreceipt of AFWP funds and was assured that her check was in the mail. In fact, no application had been made. There was evidence adduced below that another family with the same surname had made a similar application and the possibility surfaced that confusion resulting from this fact led to the erroneous information appellant claims to have received.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>Appellant had borrowed $500 to pay outstanding bills. She claims that in reliance upon the representation that her AEWP check was on the way, she made only a token payment on her Public Service bill with the result that her utilities were cut off. She says that had she known that no AEWP check would be forthcoming, she would have paid Public Service and prevented the shutoff. She claims that the Essex County Welfare Board is estopped from denying her AEWP benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\"> There is no allegation that the asserted misrepresentation concerning the AEWP payment was other than an innocent one. In light of this plus the general reluctance to apply estoppel against governmental agencies, <em>Summer Cottagers' Ass\u2019n of Cape May v. City of Cape May, </em>19 <em>N. J. </em>493 (1955), we find the refusal below to honor the estoppel argument to be free from error.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">On April 24, 1972 appellant applied for benefits under the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program (AEDC) and has been receiving such benefits since the date. In the alternative, she claims that her need for funds with which to pay her Public Service bill qualifies her for emergency assistance under <em>N. J. A. C. </em>10 :82-12.11. (It might be noted that appellant\u2019s utilities have long since been restored.) This regulation governs the supply of emergency assistance, but requires that the emergency be one for which the applicant had no advance opportunity to plan to meet. <em>N. J. A. C. </em>10 :82 \u2014 12.11 (c). Deeming the recognized inevitability of utility bills to present an expense for which ample advance planning was afforded, the claim for emergency assistance was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">Appellant counters with the assertion that the above New Jersey regulation conflicts with 42 <em>U. 8. C. A. </em>\u00a7 606(e) (1) which defines \"emergency assistance,\u201d and upon this premise argues that the New Jersey regulation must give way. We have no quarrel with the conclusion if the premise is accurate, but find this not to be so. We do not read the federal statute as attempting an exclusive definition of the term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>\u201cemergency\u201d for all situations under which emergency assistance may he provided. Rather we think the New Jersey regulation refines the term according to its general common sense understanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
