These records are maintained within the Department, are not public records and are available only to other law enforcement and related agencies. Such records are part of the overall police facilities for crime investigation, analysis, evaluation and prevention, and are necessary to the proper and effective functioning of a police department.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-8\">The arguments that these records violate the legislative policy expressed in <em>N. J. 8. A. 2A </em>:4-39 and deny plaintiff equal protection and due process of law under the Fourteenth Amendment, are without merit. <em>Cf. Anderson v. Sills, 56 N. J. </em>210 (1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-9\">It is to be noted that plaintiff\u2019s juvenile court record of having been adjudicated a juvenile delinquent may be expunged by proper proceedings under <em>N. J. 8. A. </em>2A:4-39.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
