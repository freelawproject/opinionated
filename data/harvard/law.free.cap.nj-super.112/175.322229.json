J. A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"AtK\">Plaintiffs, five residents and taxpayers of the Township of Evesham (township), on behalf of themselves and all other similarly situated taxpayers, appeal from that part of a judgment of the Chancery Division entered on July 9, 1970 denying their demands for a declaration that Henry <em>W. </em>Haines is the duly appointed tax assessor of the township for the term prescribed by <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40:46-6.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-10\">Essentially, the background facts are uncontroverted. In November 1968 Haines was elected tax assessor of the township under the then existing township committee form of government. Thereafter, effective July 1, 1969, the electorate of the township duly adopted Council-Manager Plan B of the Optional Municipal Charter Law, <em>L. </em>1950, <em>c. </em>210, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40:69A \u2014 1 <em>et 'seq., </em>commonly known as the Faulkner Act. On that date the office occupied by Haines under the pre-existing form of government was abolished <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>pursuant to <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40:69A \u2014 207.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> By resolution 12C \u2014 69 (July 1, 1969) the township council (council) availed itself of the permissive provision of section 207 empowering it to appoint interim municipal officers pending the adoption of reorganizational ordinances, and carried over all officers of the former government, including Haines as tax assessor, for the statutory 30-day transitional period. Subsequently, by resolutions 19C-69 (July 28, 1969) and 26C-69 (September 2, 1969), the terms of the officers and employees of the township were further continued for periods of 30 days and 15 days, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">On October 21, 1969 the township adopted an administrative code (ordinance 20-69), which in \u00a7 1-8.3 provides that \u201c[t]he division of Tax Assessments shall consist of a board of three members to be appointed by council and hold office for two years; the first of such appointments to be for one year and the other [sic] for two years. * * *\u201d On the same day, by resolution 42C-69, council appointed Haines to the board of tax assessors for a one-year term commencing July 1, 1969. No further appointments were made until February 17, 1970, when council designated John Howarth and James Hogan as members of the board, each for a term of two years.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">Haines was recognized as the tax assessor by Acting Manager Inez Bochis and by Thomas Gramigna, who was appointed township manager (manager) effective September 8, 1969. On or about October 1, 1969 Gramigna, in his official capacity as manager, signed and issued to Haines <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>an identification card certifying him as \u201cTownship Taxes [sic] Assessor.\u201d Haines was paid for performing the duties of that office, which included the preparation of a complete assessment list for 1970 and the filing of a duplicate thereof with the Burlington County Board of Taxation. This list contained increases in the assessed valuation of 608 properties which Haines found to be underassessed, amounting to about $2.7 million, or about 5% of the tax roll of the township.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">Thereafter, following the receipt of 253 letters from taxpayers concerning these assessments, the Burlington County Board of Taxation, on its own initiative, conducted a hearing on February 11, 1970 at which the township appeared by its attorney to contest Haines\u2019 assessments. The testimony at the hearing indicated that the reassessed properties, which had previously been on the tax rolls at an average assessment ratio of 67% had been raised to 86% of true value to conform generally with the assessments throughout the township.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">On March 18, 1970 the county tax board unanimously certified Haines\u2019 tax list and assessor\u2019s duplicate. Following this action, council indicated it would challenge the validity of the assessments in an appeal to the Division of Tax Appeals. Moreover, the mayor publicly invited taxpayers to join in the appeal or to contest their assessments individually.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">In April 1970 plaintiffs initiated the instant proceedings, seeking, among other things, declarations that \u00a7 1-8.3 of the 1969 code was invalid and that Haines was entitled to serve a four-year term as tax assessor, and injunctive relief restraining council from acting under the aforementioned section, restraining the township\u2019s appeal from the county board\u201ds certification of Haines\u2019 assessments and restraining Hogan and Howarth from assuming any duties of the office of tax assessor.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">On the return of an order to show cause, and on cross-motions for summary judgment, the judge of the Chancery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>Division delivered an oral opinion on July 2, which is embodied in an order of July 9, 1970. He declared \u00a7 1-8.3 invalid because it contravened the provision of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40:46-6.2 requiring a four-year term for tax assessors, and held all appointments made thereunder void. Furthermore, he ruled that the township\u2019s appeal from the county board\u2019s certification was <em>ultra vires </em>and an unlawful expenditure of public funds. Although the court denied plaintiffs\u2019 demand to declare Haines\u2019 status as the duly appointed tax assessor, it held that the appointments under \u00a7 1-8.3 were invalid and that, inasmuch as Haines was the former assessor, he should continue as temporary assessor until the position was filled.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">On July 2, 1970 Richard Messenger, having replaced Gramigna as manager, appointed Howarth, Hogan and Edward Bligh to four-year terms as tax assessors beginning July 1, 1970. In addition, he notified Haines of these appointments and requested that he \u201creturn all books, records and other Town property\u201d in his possession. Within a week thereafter, both council and manager appointed Hogan as sole tax assessor for a four-year term. On July 22, 1970 council amended its administrative code (ordinance 15-70), changing \u00a7 1-8.3 as follows: \u201cThe Division of Tax Assessments shall consist of a board of three members to be appointed by council and hold office for the term of four (4) years * <em>* </em>This provision was qualified thusly: \u201cThe appointments of the Assessors in their initial term shall be appointed to one (1) year, two (2) years and three (3) years respectively * * On the same date, council again appointed Howarth, Hogan and Bligh to the board of tax assessors.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Plaintiffs were unsuccessful in their attempts before the Chancery and Appellate Divisions and our Supreme Court to obtain a stay of that portion of the judgment under review which denied Haines\u2019 legal status as a tax assessor.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">To facilitate a full consideration of the pending controversy, we entered, at oral argument, a consent order adding Haines as a party plaintiff-appellant, permitting plaintiffs to further amend their complaint to include an allegation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>challenging the validity of \u00a7 1 \u2014 8.3 of the 1970 code and allowing the record to be supplemented by the addition of an affidavit by Haines and an answering affidavit by Gramigna. At the court\u2019s request, counsel has submitted supplemental memoranda.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">When the involved fact pattern of this case and the several contentions of the respective parties, augmented by extensive arguments of counsel, are brought into proper focus, there emerge three critical issues for resolution: (1) Who has the power to appoint the township tax assessor? (2) Did the township create a valid board of tax assessors? (3) Was Haines appointed for a four-year statutory term within the meaning of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40:46-6.2? We shall consider these questions <em>seriatim.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">Who has the Power to appoint the Township Tax Assessor</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">Article 10 of the Faulkner Act, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40:69A-99 to 103, \u201cCouncil-Manager Plan B,\u201d provides in substance that a municipality adopting such form of government shall be governed by its provisions together with those of Article 2, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40:69A-26 to 30, a general article entitled \u201cIncorporation and Powers\u201d; portions of Article 9 <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40:69A \u2014 86 to 98, dealing with council and manager under \u201cCouncil-Manager Plan A\u201d; and Article 17, <em>N. J, S. A. </em>40:69A-150 to 210, containing \u201cAdditional Provisions Common to Optional Plans.\u201d By the terms of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40:69A-26\u2018, such a municipality is governed by \u201call applicable provisions of general law.\u201d <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40 :69A~28 defines \u201cgeneral law\u201d to mean \u201cany law or provision of law, not inconsistent with this act, heretofore or hereafter enacted which is by its terms applicable or available to all municipalities,\u201d plus certain enumerated laws not here germane.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">The Legislature has not stated with specificity, either in the Faulkner Act or by general law, that \u201ctax assessors\u201d in council-manager municipalities shall be appointed in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>given manner. The legislative intent, however, appears to be readily ascertainable from the pertinent statutes when read <em>in pari materia </em>and considered with reference to related legislative history.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">The appointing power of the municipal manager is set forth in <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40:69A-95, which in relevant part provides :</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">The municipal manager shall:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-6\">(a) be the chief executive and administrative official of the municipality; * * * * # * sfc $</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-8\">(c) appoint and remove a deputy manager if one be authorized by the council, all department heads <em>and all other officers, </em>subordinates, and assistants <em>for whose selection or removal no other method is provided in this article </em>[\u00a7\u00a7 40:69A-81 to 98] * * *. [Emphasis added]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-9\">This section should be considered in conjunction with the language of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40:69A-88 and 89. The former reads:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-10\">All powers of the municipality and the determination of all matters of policy shall be vested in the municipal council, <em>except as otherwise provided l)y this act </em>[\u00a7\u00a7 40:69A-1 to 210] or by general law. * * * [-Emphasis added]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-11\">The latter states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-12\">The municipal council shall appoint a municipal manager and a municipal clerk. Both of such offices may be held by the same person. The council may provide for the manner of appointment of a municipal attorney, any planning board, zoning board of adjustment or <em>personnel hoard </em>in the municipality, <em>and may create commissions and other bodies with advisory powers. * * </em>* [Emphasis added]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-13\">A comparison of these sections demonstrates that, except for the appointive power lodged in the council relating to specified nonadministrative personnel, the general power of appointment as to municipal officers is reposed in the manager.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>Defendants argue that council is expressly empowered to appoint a \u201cpersonnel board\u201d and that such term is sufficiently broad to include a board of tax assessors and, by analogy, a single tax assessor. We disagree. Absent a legislative definition of the quoted words, they should be given their ordinary and well-understood meaning. See <em>Fahey v. Jersey City, </em>52 <em>N. J. </em>103, 107 (1968). The language of <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40:69A-89 is substantially the same as that contained in Article 2, \u00a7 4^9 of the proposed Optional Charter Plan study draft that preceded the adoption of the Faulkner Act. In a comment respecting \u00a7\u00a7 4r-8 to 11 of that article, the New Jersey Commission on Municipal Government stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-5\">The above amendment o\u00ed 40:81-11 of the Revised Statutes follows the <em>Model City Charter. </em>The model also provides that the <em>council shall appoint members of the personnel board, </em>the planning commission and the zoning board of appeals. <em>[State of New Jersey, Preliminary Statement of The Commission on Municipal Government, </em>at 46 (1948) (hereinafter cited as <em>Commission) </em>; emphasis added]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">Reference to the <em>Model City Charier </em>in a document prepared by the National Municipal League Committee on Revision of The Model City Charter reveals the nature and scope of the powers and duties of a \u201cpersonnel board.\u201d In short, it is empowered and required to (1) \u201cAdvise the council and director\u201d on problems concerning personnel administration; (2) \u201cAdvise and assist the director\u201d in fostering educational, civic, professional and employee organizations; (3) make any investigations concerning the administration of personnel in the municipal service; (4) hear certain appeals of officers or employees and report findings and recommendations to the city manager, and (5) perform such other duties \u201cwith reference to personnel administration\u201d as the council may require by ordinance. <em>National Municipal League Committee on Revision of The Model City Charter, Model City Charter </em>(5th ed. 1941) Art. VII, \u00a7 116 at 48-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">Moreover, it is a fundamental rule, sometimes described by the maxim <em>noscitur a </em>sociis, that in the construction of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>statutes associated words and phrases explain and limit each other. Their meaning, when in doubt, may be ascertained by a consideration of companion words and phrases. See McCaffrey, <em>Statutory </em>Construction, \u00a7 14 at 40-41 (1953). It is significant that under the Eaulkner Act the municipal council may appoint a planning board and zoning board of adjustment, which are gmssi-policy-making agencies, and it may create commissions with \u00e1dvisory power. The authority to appoint a \u201cpersonnel board\u201d is consistent with a legislative intent, absent express statutes authorizing the contrary, to limit councils appointive power to policy-making and advisory agencies. In this regard, it should not be overlooked that the Council-Manager Plan of the Eaulkner Act adheres throughout to the basic theory of the manager form \u2014 that there should be a distinct separation between policy determination and administration. <em>Commission </em>at 17. See also <em>New Jersey Taxpayers </em>Association, <em>New Jersey\u2019s Optional Municipal Charter Law </em>(1964), where it is stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-4\">The Council-Manager Plan is the product of the best thinking in the field of municipal government. Lines of authority are clear-cut, responsibility is fixed and power is commensurate with responsibility. Administrative power is placed in the hands of a professionally-trained manager who is thoroughly grounded in fiscal, administrative, personnel and other practices essential for effective management. Policy-making and the review of administrative activity belong to the Council, [at 74]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-5\">It is thus apparent that a \u201cpersonnel board,\u201d within the contemplation of the cited enactment, does not embrace the office of tax assessor or a board of tax assessors but, rather, pertains to an agency in the nature of an advisory board created by council to aid in the formulation of policy-making determinations and the proper administration thereof, as the same may relate to the officers and employees of the municipality.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">We are cited to <em>Jordan v. </em>Zidel, 40 <em>N. J. </em>244 (1963), and <em>Clifton v. Zweir, </em>36 <em>N. J. </em>309 (1962), upon which defend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>ants heavily rely. The former decision involved commissioners of a parking authority. Such an administrative agency has qwasi-policy-making powers and is distinguishable from a board of tax assessors. Additionally, the parking authority law, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40 :llA-4, expressly provides that the governing body shall appoint the commissioners.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">In <em>Zweir </em>the issue was whether an elected mayor or manager had the power to appoint members of the planning board. The court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b205-6\">* * * The new language, in light of the history, indicates choice of the reasonable criterion that municipal board members who perform policy-making and gMOsi-judicial functions, rather than mere administrative duties, should be appointed by an official who came into government by vote of the people at large and who must stand for re-election at the end of a definite term. This would be the unquestionable result under all except the manager form and we think it was equally meant here. * * * [36 <em>N. J. </em>at 320]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">The last-quoted sentence appears to be dictum and does not negate a conclusion that under <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40:69A-89 and 95 the appointment of a tax assessor is to be made by the municipal manager.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">The <em>Zweir </em>case dealt with a municipality operating under a 1923 manager form of government. There, the court observed that the Municipal Manager Act <em>(R. 8. </em>40:89~10) contained no provision dealing with agencies, like the planning board, which have policy-making functions or <em>quasi-ju.dici'el </em>powers. Here, under the Faulkner Act, specific provisions respecting such agencies have been made. In fact, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40:69A-89 requires that such board members be appointed by the municipal council. Moreover, <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40:69A-98 provides that laws conferring powers on the mayor or other executive head are to be construed as meaning municipal manager.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">The manager is the chief executive and administrative officer of the municipality, and the statutory sections concerning appointments must be construed in that light. <em>Townsend v. Pequannock Tp., </em>47 <em>N. J. Super. </em>294, 301 (Law Div. 1957). In this respect the court in <em>Zweir </em>noted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"186\">*186</page-number>that the 1923 Municipal Manager Act was to be contrasted with the Faulkner Act under which council may provide for the manner of appointment of any planning board, zoning board of adjustment or personnel board. The court further observed that according to the 1923 act council was given express power to appoint the manager, auditor, treasurer, clerk, attorney, advisory boards and assessors. See <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40:81-11, 40:81 \u2014 13 and 40:81-16. The 1923 act <em>(L. </em>1923, c. 113) vested all \"administrative, judicial and legislative powers and duties,\u201d except as otherwise provided, in council.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">In short, that whole municipal scheme was changed by the Faulkner Act. Instead of council appointing policy-making <em>and </em>administrative officers, under the Faulkner Act it may only make appointments authorized by general law or enumerated in <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40:69A-89, which do not include a tax assessor, board of tax assessors or any other board or commission whose duties and responsibilities are not essentially policy-making or advisory.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">It is noteworthy that 22 municipalities of the State have adopted a Council-Manager Plan under the Faulkner Act.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We have been advised by letter from counsel for plaintiffs, in response to inquiry from the Bench at oral argument, that in each of those municipalities, except one, the tax assessor (and multiple assessors in two instances) has been appointed by the municipal manager.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> While such empirical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>data is not binding upon the judiciary, it is well-established by a wealth of authorities that \u201cresort may be had to long usage and practical interpretation in construing statutes to ascertain their meaning, to explain a doubtful phrase or to illuminate any obscurity.\u201d <em>Lane v. Holderman, </em>23 <em>N. J. </em>304, 322 (1957); accord, <em>In re Glen Rock, </em>25 <em>N. J. </em>241, 246 (1957); <em>In re Petition of Public Service, etc., </em>103 <em>N. J. Super. </em>505, 513 (App. Div. 1968). See generally, 2 <em>Sutherland, Statutory Construction </em>(3d ed. 1943), \u00a7 5106, \u2018Unofficial interpretation,\u201d at 518-520.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">We hold that in a Council-Manager Plan B municipality the appointive power over a tax assessor or members of a board of tax assessors is vested in the municipal manager. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40 :69A-95.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">Was a valid Board of Tax Assessors created</p>\n<p id=\"b207-8\">Section 1-8.3 of the 1969 code abortively attempted to create a three-man board of tax assessors; it is defective in several particulars: the members of the board are to be appointed by the council instead of the manager; the terms of the appointees conflict with <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40:46-6.2, and the staggered term provision is unsupported by any legal authority, statutory or otherwise. The adjudication of the Chancery Division is based on its opinion that the ordinance \u201cis invalid in its entirety since it only provides a term of office for a tax assessor of two years contrary to <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40:46-6.2. * * * Because of this decision it is not necessary to decide whether the power to appoint rests with the Towuship Council or the Township Manager.\u201d We do not entirely share that view. See <em>Newman v. Fair Lawn, </em>31 <em>N. J. </em>279, 288 (1960), discussed <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b207-9\">The challenged section of the 1969 code, however, is fatally defective in that it requires the assessors to be appointed by the council instead of the manager and calls for the staggering of terms in an impermissible manner. <em>Cf. N. J. S. A. </em>40:46-6.2(a). The 1970 code did not cure all of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>these defects and it is likewise invalid. Accordingly, the numerous efforts of council, to constitute by various appointments a full membership on the respective boards it improperly attempted to create, were a nullity.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">Was Haines Appointed Eor Statutory Term</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">When a taz assessor or a member of a board of tax assessors is appointed, his designation or ratification must stem from a statutory authorization to make such appointments. The Eaulkner Act, as previously noted, makes no mention of tax assessors; it is silent as to their selection or removal. There are, however, applicable provisions of general law which are controlling. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40:46-6.2<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> provides that \u201c[t]he term of persons holding the position or office of \u2018tax assessor\u2019 in any municipality of this State is fixed at four years.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">This court recently had occasion to consider that statute in <em>Madison Tp. v. Fiore, </em>112 <em>N. J. Super. </em>23 (App. Div. 1970), where the municipal manager of the township, a Plan E. Eaulkner Act municipality, on February 22, 1966 appointed Fiore as tax assessor without stating the length of his term. Fiore was dismissed on February 11, 1970. The trial court held that the statute did not apply to Plan E municipalities. We reversed and declared that Fiore had a four-year term ending June 30, 1970. After citing <em>Clifton </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"189\">*189</page-number><em>v. Zweir, supra, </em>for the proposition that \u201c[\u00a1\u00a1Judicial resolution of such matters must be guided by only one principle: legislative intent\u201d (36 <em>N. J. </em>at 322), we concluded that there can be no doubt that when the Legislature adopted the 1938 legislation \u201cit intended that assessors in all municipalities thereafter have four-year terms, for the statute said so.\u201d (112 <em>N. J. Super. </em>at 26) We further observed that the Legislature made its intent doubly plain by providing in <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40:46-6.3 that 40:46-6.2 shall \u201cbe construed and applied to include tax assessors in all municipalities of this State, irrespective of the form of government under which such municipalities may operate * * *\u201d (At 26)</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">It follows that a municipality is without authority to establish any other term, either longer or shorter, than that fixed by the Legislature, and that once a valid appointment has been made, the office, in contemplation of law, has been filled for the statutory period.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">In <em>Gillson v. Heffernan, </em>40 <em>N. J. </em>367, 375 (1963), a case dealing with the statutory term of planning board members, the court, adopting the rationale it had previously enunciated in <em>Newman v. Fair Lawn, supra, </em>stated that \u201c[ajppointments for less than the fud legal term, as was the case here, could not give the term a different duration.\u201d <em>Newman </em>overruled that part of <em>Salter v. Burk, </em>83 <em>N. J. L. </em>152 (Sup. Ct. 1912), which held void an appointment to an office of a different term from that set by statute and applied the principle exposited by Justice Cooley in <em>Stadler v. City of Detroit, </em>13 <em>Mich. </em>346 (Sup. Ct. 1865), that the appointment was for the full legal term, notwithstanding the attempt by the appointive authority to give it a different duration. 31 <em>N. J. </em>at 288. The <em>Newman </em>court approvingly cited, among other authorities, <em>Dodsworth v. Mayor of Medford, </em>308 <em>Mass. </em>62, 30 <em>N. E. </em>2d 835 (Sup. Jud Ct. 1941). <em>Cf. Beirne v.

J. </em>307 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b210-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"190\">*190</page-number>The reasons for insulating a tax assessor with a fixed term of office are manifold.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> His office, an integral part of our state, county and municipal governments, is chargeable with the administration of a statutory system relating to the levy, assessment and collection of property taxes. He is an agent of the Legislature, and his discretionary judgment is reviewable only through the administrative and judicial processes provided by law. Although his jurisdiction js local, his powers and duties are prescribed by the Legislature, and it is of paramount importance that the integrity of his office be in no way diluted by local interference.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">In <em>Arace v. Irvington, </em>75 <em>N. J. Super. </em>258 (Law Div. 1962), it was decided that the commissioners of the Town of Irvington had no right to challenge the tax assessor\u2019s methods in evaluating and assessing properties, and that anyone aggrieved or discriminated against was provided an appropriate method of appeal. It was there emphasized that the tax assessor, in exercising the gwasi-judicial functions of his office, must feel free to make an independent judgment. See also <em>Ridgefield Park v. Bergen Cty. Bd. of Taxation, </em>61 <em>N. J. Super. </em>170 (Law Div.), rev\u2019d on other grounds 33 <em>N. J. </em>262 (1960), app. dism. 365 <em>U. S. </em>648, 81 <em>S. Ct. </em>834, 5 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 857 (1961); 4 <em>Cooley, Taxation </em>(4th ed. 1924), \u00a7 1601, at 3181.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">In recent legislation, as illustrated by <em>N. J. S. A. </em>54:1-35.25 and <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40:46-6.2(a), the Legislature has evinced its intent and continuing concern for the independence of assessors.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b211-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"191\">*191</page-number>There are no statutory provisions for \u201ctemporary,\u201d \u201choldover\u201d or \u201cinterim\u201d appointments but, to the contrary, under <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40 :46-6.2 the four-year term begins on July 1 of the year in which the appointment is made. In the event a vacancy occurs, due to any cause other than the expiration of the term of office, it \u201cshall be filled for the unexpired ierm only.\u201d <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40:46-15. Also, if there is no qualified assessor in office on the first day of October, the Governor is empowered to intervene and, if need be after ten days\u2019 notice, to commission an assessor to perform the duties of that office. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40:46-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-4\">The procedural carry-over provisions incident to the transition of government upon the adoption of a Eaulkner Act plan, as provided in <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40 :69A-207, do not alter the substantive powers and obligations of the municipality. While all offices and terms of office (exceptions not here material) are abolished, the grace period for adopting appropriate ordinances to implement the new government is limited to 30 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">The office of tax assessor, being legislative in origin, does not depend upon a municipal ordinance for its creation; and because no provision was made for a board of assessors during the organizational grace period, the continuance of the statutory office of tax assessor beyond that period constituted it a <em>de jure </em>office. Compare <em>Myers v. Cedar Grove Tp., </em>36 <em>N. J. </em>51 (1961). Also note the procedure followed in <em>McCartney v. Franco, </em>87 <em>N. J. Super. </em>292 (App. Div. 1965), where a second-class city changed its form of government under the Eaulkner Act to a Mayor-Council Plan C. On the effective date of the plan, the city council, by ordinance, continued in existence all prior departments, boards and offices with the sole exception of the board of assessors and adopted a resolution to provide for the temporary organization of the city government pending the preparation of an administrative code. On the same day plaintiff was advised that his services as an assessor wore terminated. The subsequently adopted code established an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>office of city assessor. See also <em>Dobbs v. Pierce, </em>76 <em>N. J. Super. </em>64 (Law Div. 1962). Here, there is nothing in the record which affirmatively indicates that the township intended to abolish the office of tax assessor and create a board of tax assessors until nearly three months after the organizational grace period.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">Inasmuch as the council made a number of short-term appointments of Haines as the assessor, the question as to the validity of his appointment for a statutory term need only be determined with reference to the actions of the acting manager and the manager who succeeded her, bearing in mind our determination that the appointive power is vested with the municipal manager.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">Bochis, the township clerk and acting manager from July 1 to September 8, 1969, acknowledged in her deposition that she had \u201cno reason to question\u201d the legality of Haines\u2019 status as assessor, and when asked if she approved of his appointment replied, \u201cAt that time, yes.\u201d Her successor, Manager Gramigna, testified on deposition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-6\">Q. Beginning September 8, 1969 with your appointment, prior to this litigation did you at any time question the title to office of Henry Haines, bis right to serve as assessor?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-7\">A. No. Mr. Haines was the assessor when I arrived here. The adoption of the administrative code in my opinion did not change his status as an assessor, but he became one member of a three-man board. He was the first man appointed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-8\">It is undisputed that Haines exercised all the duties and responsibilities of the tax assessor\u2019s office from July 1, 1969 to February 17, 1970, when Howarth and Hogan were appointed to the invalid board of tax assessors. During that period the managers repeatedly listed him on the public payroll, approved of the payroll, and publicly acknowledged him as assessor in the listing of municipal officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-9\">As already noted, on or about October 1, 1969 there was issued to Haines, under the signature of Gramigna as township manager, an identification card certifying that \u201cHenry W. Haines is a Township Taxes <em>[sic] </em>Assessor.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>Then, too, on March 18, 1970 the county board of taxation recognized the official capacity of Haines when it unanimously certified the 1970 duplicate assessment list he had prepared and filed with the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">There is decisional support for the theory that the conduct of the township managers constituted an approbation of Haines\u2019 status as tax assessor so as to validate his appointment. See <em>Barkus v. Sadloch, </em>20 <em>N. J. </em>551 (1956), where our Supreme Court held that the inappropriate appointment of a city employee was subsequently validated by council\u2019s acts in approving payrolls upon which the employee\u2019s name appeared. In this vein, see also <em>Cetrulo v. Byrne, </em>31 <em>N. J. </em>320, 330 (1960), and <em>Kovalycsik v. Garfield, </em>58 <em>N. J. Super. </em>229, 239 (App. Div. 1959). Furthermore, there exists a persuasive analogue buttressing Haines\u2019 appointment as tax assessor in the language of Chief Justice Marshall in <em>Marbury v. Madison:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-5\">* * * if an appointment was to be evidenced by any public act, * * * the performance of such public act would create the officer * * . [5 <em>U. S. </em>137, at 156, 1 <em>Cranch </em>137, at 156, 2 <em>L. </em>Ed. 60, at 67 (1803)]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">Note, <em>Whitney v. Van Buskirk, </em>40 <em>N. J. L. </em>463, 470 (Sup. Ct. 1878), and see 42 <em>Am. Jur., Public Officers, </em>\u00a7 100 at 957.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-9\">Here, the record is barren of any suggestion that the municipal managers at any time prior to February 17 questioned either Haines\u2019 qualifications or authority, or the regularity of his appointment. Eather, their actions plainly demonstrated not only acquiescence in and acknowledgment of his appointment, but an open and unequivocal approval and ratification thereof. Consequently, Haines\u2019 status as a tax assessor is that of a <em>de jure </em>officer occupying a <em>de jure </em>office. It is therefore unnecessary for us to consider the possible effects of his public acts had he merely been a <em>de facto </em>officer. <em>Cf. Kovalycsik v. Garfield, supra; Bernard, Public Officials: Elected and Appointed, </em>\u201cDe Facto Officers,\u201d at 70-72 (1968); <em>Constantineau, A Treatise on The De </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number><em>Facto Doctrine, </em>\u00a7\u00a7 203 and 204, at 285-288 (1910), and note generally, \u00a7\u00a7 21 and 22, at 30-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">In the circumstances, we conclude that, after July 1, 1969, Haines was effectively appointed township assessor and that, notwithstanding the efforts to limit the duration of his term by temporary or short-term appointments, the statutory term of four years must govern. To hold otherwise would do violence to the rationale of the <em>Newman </em>case as applied to <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40:46-6.2 and the legislative intent underlying the adoption of that statute. Thus, in addition to the appointments to the invalid boards already discussed, the attempts by council and Manager Messenger, in July 1970, to replace Haines by appointing Hogan as single tax assessor for a term of four years were also ineffective.</p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">In reaching this conclusion, we are mindful of defendants\u2019 argument that, as stated in <em>Downey v. Board of Education, Jersey City, </em>74 <em>N. J. Super. </em>548, 554 (App. Div. 1962), \u201c[t]he plain and all-pervading intent of the Faulkner Act. is to give a municipality which adopts one of its optional plans a new broom.\u201d It is equally important, however, that a municipality embarking on such new form of government should use the right end of the \u201cbroom.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b214-6\">The present record is replete with overtones of local pressure and examples of erratic maneuvering which suggest that the directional thinking of the township had as its ultimate objective either Haines\u2019 replacement as tax assessor or a diminution of his duties and responsibilities by the creation of a three-man board of tax assessors. This is incompatible both with the spirit and intent of the Faulkner Act and the applicable general law. That is not to say, however, that a municipality is precluded in a proper circumstance from replacing the office of a single tax assessor with a board of tax assessors. See, for example, the case of <em>McCartney v. Franco, supra, </em>87 <em>N. J. Super. </em>at 298, where this court remarked that the Faulkner Act does not take away the established right of a municipality to abolish offices or positions \u201cwhen the action is adopted in good <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>faith to effect economy, provide greater efficiency or otherwise promote the public interest.\u201d See also, <em>N.
