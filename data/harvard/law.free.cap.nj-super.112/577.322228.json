A. D.</author>\n<p id=\"Al9\">Defendant appeals from an order of the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control suspending defendant\u2019s plenary retail consumption license for 30 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-12\">The following specific charge was preferred against defendant :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-13\">On January 14 and 15, 1969, you allowed, permitted and suffered lewdness and immoral activity in and upon your licensed premises, viz., in that you allowed, permitted and suffered female persons to perform on your licensed premises for the entertainment of your customers and patrons in a lewd, indecent and immoral manner; in violation of Rule 5 of State Regulation No. 20.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>Eule 5 of State Eegulation 20 provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-5\">No licensee shall engage in or allow, permit or suffer in or upon the licensed premises any lewdness, immoral activity or foul, filthy, indecent or obscene language or conduct, or any brawl, out of violence, disturbance or unnecessary noise; nor shall any licensee allow, permit or suffer the licensed place of business to be conducted in such a manner as to become a nuisance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">Concededly, on the stated dates entertainment was supplied at defendant\u2019s premises, on January 14 by two go-go dancers and on January 15 by one such dancer, wearing transparent bibs and pasties covering only the nipples on their breasts.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">Defendant argues that \u201clewdness and immoral activity\u201d is to be determined in accordance with the criteria set forth in <em>N. J. S. A. </em>2A:115-1.1, the statute dealing with obscenity, which incorporates the First Amendment right as defined by the United States Supreme Court. <em>Roth v. United States, </em>354 <em>U. S. </em>476, 77 <em>S. Ct. </em>1304, 1 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 1498 (1957), rehearing den. 355 <em>U. S. </em>852, 78 <em>S. Ct. </em>8, 2 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 60 (1957); <em>A Book Named \u201cJohn Cleland\u2019s Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure\u201d v. Attorney General of Mass., </em>383 <em>U. S. </em>413, 86 <em>S. Ct. </em>975, 16 <em>L. Ed. </em>2d 1 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-8\">A license to sell intoxicating liquor is not a contract nor is it a property right. Eather, it is a temporary permit or privilege to pursue an occupation which is otherwise illegal. Since it is a business attended with danger to the community, it may be entirely prohibited or be permitted under such conditions as will limit to the utmost its evils. <em>Mazza v. Cavicchia, </em>15 <em>N. J. </em>498, 505 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b599-9\">We are not here concerned with the censorship of a book, nor with the alleged obscenity of a theatrical performance. \u201cOur immediate interest and attention is confined to the disciplinary action taken against the licensee of a public tavern, whose privileges may lawfully be tightly restricted to limit to the utmost the evils of the trade.\u201d <em>McFadden\u2019s Lounge, Inc. v. Div. of Alcoholic Bev. Control, </em>33 <em>N. J. Super. </em>61, 68 (App. Div. 1954). Lewdness or im<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"580\">*580</page-number>morality for the purpose of alcoholic beverage control may be determinable on a distinctly narrower basis than for purposes of regulation of commercial entertainment generally. <em>Davis v. New Town Tavern, </em>37 <em>N. J. Super. </em>376, 378 (App. Div. 1955); <em>Jeanne\u2019s Enterprises, Inc. v. New Jersey, etc., </em>93 <em>N. J. Super. </em>230 (App. Div. 1966), aff\u2019d o. b. 48 <em>N. J. </em>359 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">The public policy of this State strictly limiting the type of permissible entertainment in taverns was recently declared in <em>Paterson Tavern &amp; Grill Owners Ass\u2019n Inc., v. Hawthorne, </em>108 <em>N. J. Super. </em>433, 438 (App. Div. 1970), rev\u2019d on other grounds, 57 <em>N. J. </em>180 (1970), where the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-5\">The ordinance seeks to ban from Hawthorne\u2019s taverns and other licensed premises the \u201ctopless\u201d and \u201cbottomless\u201d entertainer or dances. The community has a right to protect itself against this kind of an immoral atmosphere which exists elsewhere in the United States. Such so-called \u201centertainment\u201d is nothing more or less than an appeal to the prurient interest. It is bait to bring customers to the bar and hold them there, for the obvious purpose of increasing the sale of alcoholic beverages. It may be validly curbed, as Hawthorne provides in its ordinance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b600-6\">Finally, defendant contends it received an advisory opinion from a Deputy Director of the Division to the effect that the apparel would not be violative of State law. This was denied. The hearer for the Director in the present case correctly noted that at best this argument might be urged to indicate that defendant\u2019s conduct was not willful and that there were mitigating circumstances to be considered. He pointedly stated that all licensees are charged with knowledge of the admonition of former Director Joseph P. Lordi expressed in an earlier proceeding against a licensee charged with employing \u201ctopless\u201d female employees, set forth in Bulletin 1778, Item 5, reprinted in Bulletin 1805 Item 1, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b600-7\">In passing, however, I wish emphatically to advise all licensees, that so called \u201ctopless\u201d female employees, whether entertainers or otherwise, and whether with pasties described by the Division agents <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"581\">*581</page-number>or the larger ones described by the licensee\u2019s witnesses, will not be tolerated on licensed premises in this State.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">The Director\u2019s action was a reasonable exercise of the supervisory power entrusted to him by the Legislature, and we perceive no basis to disturb his determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
