Van Winkle Avenue is zoned primarily for low and medium residential use, with only the area in which the subject property is located zoned for industrial use. On the western border of the property are the tracks of Brie Eailroad Company, across which is an area zoned for light manufacturing.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">Approximately 25% of the property in the industrial district is being used for residences. There is a public school within 200 feet of the property in issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">Plaintiff, an adjoining property owner whose land is used for warehousing and as a trucking terminal, objected to defendant\u2019s application for the variance. However, the variance was recommended and thereafter granted. The Law Division sustained the variance, as noted above.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-10\">In recommending the variance, the zoning board of adjustment found, among other things, that (1) because of the property\u2019s unique location and the status of the surrounding neighborhood, the proposed use was \"particularly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>suitable\u201d and \"will not be detrimental to the public good,\u201d (2) \"the proposed use will be in harmony with the intent and purpose of the Zoning Ordinance of the City of Garfield.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">Plaintiffs maintain that a zoning ordinance may prohibit a residential use in an industrial district. This is true. <em>Cf. Kozesnik v. Montgomery Tp., </em>24 <em>N. J. </em>154 (1957), wherein the court said (at 169) \u201c* * * homes are no more appropriate in an industrial district than industry in a residential one. In both situations the baleful influences upon residences are the same. Moreover, industry may prefer to avoid the frictions which ensue when discordant uses are side by side.\u201d' The municipal welfare may be \"better served by avoiding motley activities within its districts.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>See, too, <em>Gruber v. Raritan Tp., </em>73 <em>N. J. Super. </em>120, 129 (App. Div. 1962). \u201cThe question is one of reasonableness under the circumstances.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">The allowance of a variance to permit in a partieuuar zone a use not sanctioned in that zone may not be bottomed on the fact simply that it is (1) a \"higher use,\u201d <em>e.g., </em>a fine residence, rather than a factory, or (2) more profitable or more advantageous to the property owner, <em>e. g., </em>a gasoline station rather than a one-family home. Moreover, a more liberal municipal ordinance may not deviate from or lessen the requirements of the statute as to the grant of a variance. The ordinance provision herein dispensing with the need of a showing of \"special reasons\u201d is not valid. Our Zoning Act specifies the grounds upon which a variance may be allowed. <em>N. J. S. A. </em>40:55-39. Thus, the statute refers to cases where enforcement would cause \u201cundue hardship\u201d to the property owner. No such claim is made here. In fact, this plot can be sold for and converted to an industrial use. The statute also permits the grant of a variance for \u201cspecial reasons.\u201d That is the ground asserted for the requested variance herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">Does the construction of a garden-type apartment complex to house 38 family units, on less than an acre of land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>in the center of a heavy industrial zone, constitute a \u201cspecial reason5' for the grant of a \u201cvariance,55 within the statutory meaning of \u201cspecial reasons55? Does the fact that the subject plot of ground is within and near the center of the industrial zone alter the situation? Does the proximity of the particular plot to a residential zone or a school, or the existence of some limited other nonconforming residential uses in this industrial zone, legally justify issuance of a variance to add still another unpermitted use? These are the questions before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">We answer them all in the negative, in inverse order. The policy of the law is to limit and dimmish nonconforming uses, rather than increase or enlarge them. If further residential use in this industrial zone goes on unchecked, its character as an industrial zone will be lost. The perimeter of one zone is always in proximity to its adjacent zones. But proximity does not <em>per se </em>warrant intrusion into a zone of an unpermited use therein simply because such a use is allowed in a neighboring zone. If such blending of uses were sanciioned, zone boundaries would become meaningless. If the contrast between adjoining zones is too severe, then the establishment of \u201cbuffer zones55 to soften the contrast is an accustomed practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">Our courts have interpreted \u201cspecial reasons55 in the application of that terminology to specific cases. In the most recent instance, <em>De Simone v. Greater Englewood Housing Corp. No. 1, </em>56 <em>N. J. 428 </em>(1970), it was held that public or semi-public housing accommodations to provide safe, sanitary and decent housing, to relieve and replace substandard living conditions, or to furnish housing for minority or underprivileged segments of population outside of a ghetto area, is a \u201cspecial reason55 within the statute authorizing grant of a use variance upon an affirmative finding of special reasons. <em>De Simone </em>involved a lease of a ten-acre tract of citv-owned land to a nonprofit housing corporation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>for the purpose of development of a low cost housing project. The district was zoned for one-family dwellings.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">In <em>Be Simone </em>Justice Hall pointed out that \"special reasons\u201d is a flexible concept and includes the promotion of \"health, morals or the general welfare.\u201d 56 <em>N. J. </em>at 440. Variances \"have been approved for many public and semi-public uses because they significantly further the general welfare.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>They include a parochial school in a residential zone, <em>Andrews v. Board of Adjustment, Ocean Tp., </em>30 <em>N. J. </em>245 (1959) and <em>Black v. Montclair, </em>34 N. J. 105 (1961); a private school in a residental zone, <em>Burton v. Montclair, </em>40 <em>N. J. </em>1 (1963); a dial telephone service equipment building in a residential zone, <em>Yahnel v. Board of Adjustment, Jamesburg, </em>79 <em>N. J. Super. </em>509 (App. Div. 1963), certif. den. 41 <em>N. J. </em>116 (1963); a private hospital for emotionally disturbed in a residential zone, <em>Kunzler v. Hoffman, </em>48 <em>N. J. </em>277 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">On the other hand, the grant of a variance to permit extension of a dairy into a residential zone was deemed arbitrary and unreasonable. <em>Kohl v. Mayor, etc., Fair Lawn, </em>50 <em>N. J. </em>268 (1967). In <em>Kramer v. Bd. of Adjust., Sea Girt, </em>45 <em>N. J. </em>268 (1965), a zoning use variance to permit construction of a seaside hotel in a residential zone was upheld, so that an old nonconforming seaside resort hotel could be replaced by an attractive, modern fireproof hotel.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">As noted in <em>Kramer:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-7\">The question on appellate review of the municipal action here involved is whether the authorities could reasonably conclude from the evidence presented that \u201ca special reason\u201d existed for the granting of the variance sought and whether it could be done without any substantial detriment to the public good or substantial impairment of the zoning plan and ordinance. If such support for the application reasonably appears, approval of the variance will not be declared arbitrary or capricious. [45 <em>N. J. </em>at 285]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">Put simply, \"if a variance satisfies the negative criteria of section 39, if may be affirmatively based solely on the special <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>reason of \u2018promotion of the general welfare,\u2019' even in the absence of any showing that the property is uniquely circumstanced.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">We have not been referred to any case wherein the erection of an apartment house complex to contain 38 residential units has been deemed a \"special reason\u201d to allow it, by way of a variance, in a heavy industrial zone. Perhaps, in its broadest connotation, the \"general welfare\u201d is furthered by new housing accommodations, especially in these days of a housing shortage in our State. But the emphasis in our ease law has generally been upon the satisfying of some \u201cpublic or semi-public\u201d purpose, as constituting a furtherance of the \u201cgeneral welfare,\u201d such as the use of residentiallyzoned property for a school, a hospital, a telephone equipment center, or public housing. Here, an apartment complex with only 38 residential units on less than an acre of land is not in the same category.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">In <em>Schoelpple v. Woodbridge </em>Tp., 60 <em>N. J. Super. </em>146 (App. Div. 1960), the Law Division had upheld the grant of a variance permitting construction of a supermarket in a residential zone. We reversed, holding that grant of the variance was improper because it would substantially impair the intent and purpose of the zone plan. We said (at 152), \u201cIf the ordinance is so outmoded and ill-fitting, its alteration must be by amendment or revision. It may not be done by variance.\u201d So, too, we noted (at 155) that extension by variance of land use zones in a municipality is not to be measured by the dollar, and a variance is not justified merely because real estate values will not be depreciated. Nor is it sufficient \u201cthat the proposed use would be more profitable to the owners than the permitted uses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">We find no \u201cspecial reasons\u201d herein for the invasion of this heavy industrial zone with a 38-unit apartment complex to be privately owned and operated presumably by the owners for profit.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>The judgment of the Law Division is reversed and the case is remanded with directions that judgment be entered in favor of the plaintiffs setting aside the variance.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
