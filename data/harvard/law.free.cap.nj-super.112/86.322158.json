We therefore consider the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">Appellants admit that their negligence was sufficient to have made them liable to plaintiff but for the intervening \u201cunconscionable conduct\u201d of defendant\u2019s general agent, which they argue requires reformation of the insurance policy and results in their exculpation.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-10\">The trial judge characterized the general agent\u2019s alleged dereliction as at most an oversight and found no evidence if was deliberate and amounted to unconscionable conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-11\">The real wrongdoers were appellants-brokers. First, the wrong kind of coverage was ordered. Second, after defendant\u2019s general agent did not notice appellants\u2019 mistake <em>via </em>the O\u2019Hanlon Reports, appellants were guilty of further negligence by their failure as brokers to review the policy issued and to make sure that it conformed to their client\u2019s insurance need.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>The trial court\u2019s ruling that reformation of the policy did not lie, but' that appellants were liable to plaintiff for negligence, is amply supported by the credible evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"AZz\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
