After a full hearing he concluded \u201cthat the aforesaid agreement has been established by evidence that is cogent, clear and convincing, and which has left no doubt in the court\u2019s mind as to the parties actually having entered into such an agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-11\">We have considered the entire record and find substantial credible evidence therein to justify the conclusions reached by Judge Lora. We are in accord with the views expressed in his opinion reported in 104 <em>N. J. Super. </em>586 (Ch. 1969).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-12\">On this appeal at oral argument appellants contended that the real estate located in New Jersey of which Celeonor died <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>seized should not have been impressed with a constructive trust because she obtained the fee thereto as the surviving tenant by the entirety, and not from her husbands estate. This contention was not raised or considered by Judge Lora, nor was it included in the briefs before us. Under the circumstances it may not be presented for the first time on appeal. <em>Oradell Village, et al. v. Township of Wayne, </em>101 <em>N. J. Super. </em>403 (App. Div. 1968), aff\u2019d 53 <em>N. J. </em>496 (1969). In any event, we see no merit to the contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">Affirmed in all respects. No costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
