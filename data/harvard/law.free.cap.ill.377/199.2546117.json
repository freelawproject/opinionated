Mau and the People have sued out this writ of error to review that judgment under the authority given them by paragraph 747 of the Criminal Code. Ill. Rev. Stat. 1939, chap. 38, par. 747.</p> <p id=\"b200-6\" pgmap=\"200(283) 201(18)\">The sole question is, did this indictment charge the crime of forgery? The allegations of the indictment were that on April 12, 1937, and for some time prior thereto, defendant was the comptroller of the city of Berwyn. As such he had general supervision of all the accounting which related to the fiscal affairs of that city. In his official capacity he had custody and control of the city\u2019s account books and records of its several funds, including the special assessment fund. It was also alleged that when a special assessment bond was presented for payment by the holder thereof, defendant had the duty to examine the account books in his office in reference to the fund from which such a bond was payable and to determine whether the fund was sufficient to pay the bond either in whole or in part; that if the fund was sufficient, defendant had the duty to prepare in triplicate a special assessment disbursement sheet. He was required to enter on it the name and address of the bondholder who presented the bond, the serial number, the amount of money in the fund available for payment, and if there was not enough to pay the bond in full, the amount remaining due after the partial payment had been made. The original white disbursement sheet was to be delivered together with the remittance to the person who presented the bond. A yellow second copy or disbursement sheet was retained, filed in the office of the comptroller as a part of the official records of that office and constituted the original record of the disbursement. In the execution of the warrant and authorization for payment, the mayor and treasurer of the city relied on the information contained in this duplicate disbursement sheet.</p> <p id=\"b201-5\" pgmap=\"201\">The charge is that on said date the defendant \u201cdid unlawfully, feloniously, fraudulently, wilfully and falsely make, forge and counterfeit a certain \u2018duplicate\u2019 special assessment disbursement sheet of said city of Berwyn, which said false, forged, fraudulent and counterfeit \u2018duplicate\u2019 special assessment disbursement sheet then and there bore the signature of said Ernest W. Mau as such comptroller and then and there purported to be a record' and authentic matter of a public nature of said city of Berwyn and then and there was in the words, letters and figures following:</p> <blockquote id=\"b201-6\" pgmap=\"201\">\u201c(Duplicate)</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b201-7\" pgmap=\"201\">CITY OF BERWYN, ILLINOIS Office of Comptroller</blockquote> <blockquote id=\"b201-8\" pgmap=\"201\">Berwyn, Ill.

Mau made, forged and counterfeited said duplicate special assessment disbursement sheet with the intent thereby then and there to prejudice, damage and defraud the city of Berwyn and that by reason of the premises he is deemed guilty of forgery.</p> <p id=\"b202-5\" pgmap=\"202(184) 203(382) 204(256)\">The pertinent provisions of section 105 of division 1 of the Criminal Code (paragraph 277) are: \u201cEvery person who shall falsely make, alter, forge or counterfeit any record or other authentic matter of a public nature * * * or shall utter, publish, pass or attempt to pass as true and' genuine * * * any of the above named false, altered, forged or counterfeited matters * * * knowing the same to be false, altered, forged or counterfeited, with intent to prejudice, damage or defraud any * * * body politic * * * shall be deemed guilty of forgery,\u201d etc. Common law forgery is defined in Bishop\u2019s New Criminal Law, volume 2, paragraph 523, as follows: \u201cForgery, at the common law, is the false making or materially altering, with intent to defraud of any writing which, if genuine, might apparently be of legal efficacy or the foundation of a legal liability. * * * Reduced to the briefer expression, \u2018Forgery is the fraudulent making of a false writing, which, if genuine, would be apparently of some legal efficacy.\u2019 \u201d But in paragraph 584 the learned author, under the title \u201cMaking in one\u2019s own name a false writing to defraud,\u201d says: \u201c1. How in England. \u2014 Coke says that forgery \u2018is properly taken when the act is done in the name of another person.\u2019 Yet he also lays down the further doctrine, which seems to rest on ancient adjudication, and which the English commissioners affirmed in their report of 1840, that, as expressed by the latter, \u2018An offender may be guilty of a false making of an instrument although he sign and execute it in his own name, in case it be false in any material part, and calculated to induce another to give credit to it as genuine and authentic, when it is false and deceptive. This happens where one, having conveyed land, afterwards for the purpose of fraud executes an instrument purporting to be a prior conveyance of the same land. Here the instrument is designed to obtain credit by deception, as purporting to have been made at a time earlier than the true time of its execution.\u2019 \u201d (Regina v. Ritson, L. R. 1 Cr. Cas. 200 (1859).) This is found in paragraph 585 : \u201c2. In just principle, \u2014 this sort of writing is as distinctly false as any falsely purporting to be signed by a third person. In the illustrative case before us, it is in genuine legal form, and it falsely professes to have created a title which ousts the true owner. Thus is covered the whole idea of forgery. Therefore there is no ground for rejecting the doctrine, of the English books as it appeared in them when our country was settled. Looking into them for authority we find it all one way. Said Blackburn, J., in the English case just cited: \u2018There is no definition of \u201cforge\u201d in the statute, and we must therefore inquire what is the meaning of the word. The definition in Comyns (Dig. tit. Eorgery, A, I) is, \u2018Forgery is where a man fraudulently writes or publishes a false deed or writing to the prejudice of the right of another,\u2019 \u2014 not making an instrument containing that which is false, which, I agree with Mr. Torr, would not be forgery, but making an instrument which purports to be that which it is not. Bacon\u2019s Abr. (tit. Forgery, A.), which, it is well known, was compiled from the manuscript of Chief Baron Gilbert, explains forgery thus: \u2018The notion of forgery doth not so much consist in the counterfeiting of a man\u2019s hand and seal, . . . but in the endeavoring to give an appearance of truth to a mere deceit and falsity, and either to impose that upon the world as the solemn act of another which he is in no way privy to, or at least to make a man\u2019s own act appear to have been done at a time when it was not done, and by force of such a falsity to give it an operation which in truth and justice it ought not to have.\u2019 The material words, as applicable to the facts of the present case, are, \u2018to make a man\u2019s own act appear to have been done at a time when it was not done.\u2019 When an instrument professes to be executed at a date different from that at which it really was executed, and the false date is material to the operation of the deed, if the false date is inserted knowingly and with a fraudulent intent, it is a forgery at the common law. . . . All the text-books agree, and there is no single authority against the definition I have stated. Mr. Torr, however, says that the definition is old. I think that this gives it all the greater weight. Plainly,\u2014</p> <p id=\"b204-5\" pgmap=\"204\">\u201c3. Altering Own. \u2014 The broad doctrine is not maintainable that a man cannot commit forgery of an instrument executed by himself. If, for example, after he had signed, sealed, and delivered a deed, he should surreptitiously, getting it into his temporary possession, alter it to accomplish some fraud, this would be forgery. And if one alters a document which he has previously forged, he commits a new offense.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b204-6\" pgmap=\"204(64) 205(255)\">In the case of Ex Parte Hibbs, 26 Fed. 421, Hibbs, the postmaster at Lewiston, Idaho, issued a postal money order on the application of a fictitious person, without consideration therefor, payable to a bank. He wrote, at the same time, in the name of the fictitious person and directed the bank to collect the money and send it in a registered package to the fictitious person at Pierce City. He then intercepted the package when it passed through his post-office and converted the contents to his own use. It was held that his act constituted forgery under the common law and under the statute of the United States. After discussing the case of Regina v. Ritson, supra, the court said: \u201cBut in my judgment there is no difference in law or morals in making a deed with a false date for the purpose of defrauding another, and falsely making and issuing a money order, as postmaster, without consideration or authority for the same purpose. In either case, the party does, by force of his falsity and deceit, give the instrument, in the language of the authority above cited, \u2018an operation which in truth and justice it ought not to have.\u2019 This case also comes within the well-known rule, long since established, that it is forgery for an agent, who has authority to fill, with a particular sum, a blank in a paper signed by his principal, to fill it with a larger one; or to fill it at all without authority. (1 Wharton on Criminal Law, pars. 671, 672.) In my judgment, the filling the blank in each of these orders with the sum of $100 by the prisoner, when acting as the agent of the United States, contrary to his authority and the positive directions of his principal, being done with intent to defraud was a false making and forgery thereof.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b205-5\" pgmap=\"205(137) 206(94)\">In the case before us Mau was the agent of the city and only had authority to make true, genuine, correct and valid Special assessment disbursement sheets. In People v. Kubanek, 370 Ill. 646, Kubanek was the agent for Mrs. Burns. He had authority to fill in two checks to pay the expense of her illness and her funeral bill if she should die. He filled the checks in and made them payable to himself. We reexamined the case of People v. Kramer, 352 Ill. 304, and overruled that decision because Kramer was acting in a ministerial capacity as agent of Marion county, Illinois, of which he was the county clerk, and exceeded his authority by drawing a county order payable to himself for a debt that did not exist. The Kramer decision contained no discussion of the fact that Kramer exceeded his authority with intent to defraud his county. The following appears in paragraph 580 of Bishop\u2019s New Criminal Law: \u201c1. Agent disobeying instructions \u2014 In civil jurisprudence, the principal is often bound by the acts of his agent in disobedience of instructions, \u2014 an estoppel necessary for the protection of innocent third persons. But this doctrine has no relevancy to the criminal law of forgery. Obviously an authority to do one thing is not an authority to do another and different thing. So that,\u2014</p> <p id=\"b206-5\" pgmap=\"206\">\u201c2. Wrongly filling Blank. \u2014 If a person signs and delivers to his clerk a blank check on a bank, or a blank bill of exchange with direction to fill the blank with a sum named, the clerk by fraudulent^ filling it with a larger sum commits forgery. And it is forgery fraudulently to fill a blank for the name of the grantee in an executed deed of land.\u201d</p> <p id=\"b206-6\" pgmap=\"206\">In People v. Kubanek, supra, we pointed out that experience has shown that no generic definition of forgery can be comprehensive enough to include all the crimes and cheats that may be committed by the simple use of pen and ink. For this reason legislatures have found it necessary to enact statutes broad enough to include in the category of forgeries many acts criminal in their effect that would not fall within the earlier definitions of that crime. Our statute provides that whosoever shall \u201cfalsely make, alter, forge or counterfeit any record or other authentic matter of a public nature\u201d shall be guilty of forgery.</p> <p id=\"b206-7\" pgmap=\"206(97) 207(106)\">What did the General Assembly mean by the phrase \u201cfalsely make * * * authentic matter of a public nature\u201d? It could not have meant to limit the case to the forgery of the name of the person who was authorized to make the authentic matter of a public nature, or a record, for such an instrument or record would not be \u201cauthentic.\u201d It would have no legal effect. If the statutory provision is to be given effect it follows that anyone authorized to make up the record or to execute the authentic matter of a public nature, will be guilty of forgery if he makes such record or executes such authentic matter, knowing that its contents are false and untrue, and if by so doing he intends to defraud either an individual or the body politic by which he was employed. This construction is supported by the later provision of the section to the effect that whoever shall \u201cutter, publish, pass * * * any of the above named false, altered, forged or counterfeited matters\u201d shall be guilty of forgery. It is to be noted that in this part of the section, \u201cfalse\u201d and not \u201cfalsely made\u201d is the term used.</p> <p id=\"b207-5\" pgmap=\"207\">The allegations of this indictment charge an offense against this section of our Criminal Code. It charges that Mau exceeded his authority as comptroller. If he made the false special assessment disbursement sheet he was not authorized to make, with intent to defraud the city, knowing that it was a false record, although authentic in the sense that he was the person authorized to make special assessment disbursement sheets, he subjected himself to prosecution for forgery as defined in our statute.</p> <p id=\"b207-6\" pgmap=\"207\">For the reasons stated the judgment of the criminal court of Cook county is reversed and this cause is remanded, with directions to that court to overrule the motion to quash.</p> <p id=\"b207-7\" pgmap=\"207\">Reversed and remanded, with directions.</p> </opinion> <opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\"> <author id=\"b207-8\" pgmap=\"207\">Mr. Justice; Murphy,</author> <p id=\"Aay\" pgmap=\"207\">dissenting.</p> <author id=\"b207-9\" pgmap=\"207\">Per Curiam :</author> <p id=\"Ab4\" pgmap=\"207\">Counsel for defendant in error have called to our attention on petition for re-hearing the case of People v.
