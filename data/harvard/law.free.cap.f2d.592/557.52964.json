Ten years is the mandatory minimum sentence for violation of \u00a7 176a by one who has a prior drug conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-14\">In <em>Leano v. United States, </em>494 F.2d 361 (9th Cir. 1974) [Leano I], this court considered the validity of the district court\u2019s sentencing. We determined that the transcript on its face established a \u201creasonable probability\u201d that \u201cthe sentencing judge enhanced punishment on the basis of a conviction void because [Leano] had not been afforded his Sixth Amendment right to counsel. <em>United States v. Tucker, </em>404 U.S. 443, 92 S.Ct. 589, 30 L.Ed.2d 592 (1972).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 362. We thus \u201c \u2018remanded to the district court for resentencing without consideration of any prior convictions which is [sic] invalid under <em>Gideon v. Wainright, </em>372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 (1963).\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 363.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-15\">Upon remand the original sentencing judge reimposed the identical ten-year sentence, disclaiming reliance upon the invalid prior. Leano again appealed to this court. We consolidated the second <em>Leano </em>appeal with the appeal in <em>Farrow v. United States, </em>No. 74-2429. Although the panel in the consolidated <em>Farrow-Leano </em>appeal split as to the proper resolution of appellant Farrow\u2019s claims, it was unanimous in remanding Leano\u2019s cause for reconsideration of the sentence. Specifically, the panel wrote that the sentencing judge reimposed</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A-S\">upon Leano the identical ten-year sentence which the <em>Leano I </em>record shows he thought to be the \u201cminimum\u201d (based on the erroneous view that Leano was a second offender) at the time of the original sentencing. <em>See </em>494 F.2d at 362-363 n.3. During the resentencing proceeding, the judge reiterated his earlier disclaimer of reliance on the certification of a prior conviction at the original sentencing even though, as we concluded in <em>Leano I, </em>the sentencing transcript manifests otherwise. In addition, the judge gave an \u201cexplanation\u201d of his original sentencing at some length, taking the position that he had relied on a recommendation of a ten-year sentence contained in the presentence report. . . . However, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>cover page of that presentence report . clearly indicates that the report was prepared under the assumption that Leano was a second offender . Hence it appears that the judge\u2019s recollection of the sentencing proceeding has been dimmed by the intervening years</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-6\">. [Wjhere, as here, there is no evidentiary basis for [the judge\u2019s \u201cfinding\u201d that the original sentence was not enhanced based on improper factors], it must be deemed clearly erroneous, the sentence must be vacated, and the prisoner resentenced . . . . The matter now before us is in essentially the same posture as in <em>Leano I. </em>The substantial lingering doubt as to whether the original ten-year sentence may have been based on improper considerations hovers over the new sentence. Accordingly, that sentence must be vacated and the cause remanded for a fresh resentencing. For the judge\u2019s sake and the appearance of justice, the Chief Judge of the United States District Court for the Central District of California shall on remand designate a different judge to conduct the resentencing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-8\">After the consolidated <em>Farrow-Leano </em>decision was issued, a rehearing en banc was granted in the cause of <em>Farrow. </em>No rehearing was requested in the cause of <em>Leano. </em>Accordingly, the mandate in <em>Leano </em>was not withdrawn. See <em>Farrow v. United States, </em>580 F.2d 1339, 1344 n.1 (9th Cir. 1978) (en banc). Nonetheless, the consolidated <em>Farrow-Leano </em>opinion was withdrawn. <em>Gelfuso v. Bell, </em>590 F.2d 754, 755 (9th Cir. 1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-9\">Pursuant to the <em>Leano </em>mandate, the remand of <em>Leano </em>was assigned to a different judge for reconsideration of the sentence. That judge reduced Leano\u2019s sentence from ten years to eight years on each count, to run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-10\">Although the consolidated panel decision in <em>Farrow-Leano </em>has been withdrawn, and although the cause of <em>Leano </em>was not directly in issue in the en banc consideration of <em>Farrow, </em>this court en banc placed its imprimatur upon the panel\u2019s unanimous <em>Leano </em>analysis. The court en banc noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-12\">[Wjhere the district judge\u2019s disclaimer of reliance on the invalid priors is in fact contradicted by the record, we have held that the case must be remanded for re-sentencing without consideration of any prior conviction invalid under <em>Gideon. Leano v. United States, </em>494 F.2d 361 (9th Cir. 1974). . . . <em>Leano </em>represented an exception to the procedures [approved in <em>Farrow </em>for <em>Tucker </em>claims] where there was \u201cno support in the record for the court\u2019s statement that it had not relied on the prior,\u201d and indeed, \u201cit was clear that the trial judge imposed the ten-year sentence <em>because of </em>the prior conviction.\u201d <em>Wilson v. United States, </em>534 F.2d at 131 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b619-14\"><em>Farrow, </em>580 F.2d at 1348 (en banc) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-15\">The court en banc also approved of our direction that a different judge should conduct the resentencing. After noting that <em>\u201cTucker </em>petitions . . . should ordinarily be decided by the original sentencing judge,\u201d 580 F.2d at 1351, the court en banc, through Judge Choy, added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-17\">As our decisions in <em>Leano . . . </em>and <em>Wilson v. United States, </em>534 F.2d 130, 133 (9th Cir. 1976) make clear, there is an important distinction between the ordinary <em>Tucker </em>case and cases in which the sentencing judge\u2019s determination of a \u00a7 2255 <em>Tucker </em>petition is inconsistent with the record. The fact that the record in <em>Leano </em>contradicted the sentencing judge\u2019s disclaimer of reliance on an allegedly invalid prior \u2014 he considered the minimum sentence to be ten years, which could not have been the case if he had disregarded the challenged conviction\u2014 was the basis for the author\u2019s concurrence in . remanding the case to a new judge for resentencing. . As stated in <em>United States v. Robin, </em>553 F.2d 8, 11 (2d Cir. 1977), \u201c[i]n the rare case where a judge has repeatedly adhered to an erroneous view after the error is called to his attention [citation omitted], reassignment to another judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>may be advisable in order to avoid \u2018an exercise in futility [in which] the Court is merely marching up the hill only to march right down again,\u2019 <em>United States v. Tucker, </em>404 U.S. 443, 452, 92 S.Ct. 589, 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 592 (1972) (Blackmun, J., dissenting).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">Id. at 1351-52 n.20.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">In short, this court\u2019s en banc decision in <em>Farrow </em>confirms the propriety of the remand of <em>Leano </em>to the district court with instruction for resentencing by a different judge.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b618-16\">. This provision was repealed by Pub.L. 91-513, Title III, \u00a7 1101(a)(2), 84 Stat. 1291.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
