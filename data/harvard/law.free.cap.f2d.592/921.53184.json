Other than this, Mr. Ellis removed no member of the respondent union from the picket-line and requested no other member not to participate in picketing activities. Tr., pp. 58-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-8\">46. The respondents, each, violated contemptuously the orders of January 18, 1972 and November 18,1974 of this Court herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-9\">(a) The violations by the respondent Mr. Ellis consisted both of:</p>\n<p id=\"b988-10\">(1) violations thereof by his personal actions, and,</p>\n<p id=\"b988-11\">(2) standing passive in the face of flagrant conduct by members of his corespondent union without taking effective affirmative action to repudiate this misconduct, which lack of effective action amounted to an acquiescence in the activities and objectives of the members of the corespondent union.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-12\">(b) The violations by the respondent union consisted of its standing passive in the face of flagrant conduct by many of its striking members with no affirmative action having been taken by the respondent union to repudiate this misconduct, which course of passivity and inaction amounted to silent approbation and an acquiescence in the activities and objectives of such of its members as were violating this Court\u2019s orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-14\">The master arrived at the following</p>\n<p id=\"b988-15\">CONCLUSIONS OF LAW:</p>\n<p id=\"b988-16\">A. The respondents were bound by the aforementioned injunctive orders of this Court and obliged to obey the commands thereof. <em>New Jersey v. New York City </em>(1935), 296 U.S. 259, 260-261, 56 S.Ct. 188, 80 L.Ed. 214, 214-215.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-17\">B. (1) Disobedience of the aforementioned orders of this Court by the respective respondents was required to have been shown by clear and convincing evidence. <em>Oriel v. Russell </em>(1929), 278 U.S. 358, 364, 49 S.Ct. 173, 73 L.Ed. 419; <em>N. L. R. B. v. Local 5881, United Mine Workers of America, </em>C.A.6th (1963), 323 F.2d 853, 854.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-18\">(2) \u201c * * * Clear and convincing evidence * * * \u201d required the petitioner to \u201c * * * come forward with \u2018more than a bare preponderance of the evidence to prevail.\u2019 * * * \u201d <em>United Mine Workers v. Gibbs </em>(1966), 383 U.S. 715, 737[15], 86 S.Ct. 1130, 1145, 16 L.Ed.2d 218.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-19\">C. (1) Only ordinary evidence was required to establish the agency for the union of the aforenamed individual members of the respondent union in taking the disobedient actions they were found to have taken. <em>Cf. </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152 (13); House Conference Report No. 150 on H.R. 3020, 80th Congress, 1st Session, 36 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b988-20\">(2) Participation by knowing tolerance in such actions by the respondent union constituted a sufficient showing of agency. <em>United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, supra, </em>383 U.S. at 739 [17], 86 S.Ct. 1130.</p>\n<p id=\"b988-21\">(3) The lack of effective action by the respondent union, in the face of the flagrant conduct by its individual members, to repudiate that misconduct amounted to silent approbation and acquiescence in such activities and the objective of its offending members. <em>National Labor Relations Board v. Bulletin Company, </em>C.A.3d (1971), 443 F.2d 863, 867; see also <em>Squillacote v. Local </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"929\">*929</page-number><em>248, Meat &amp; Allied Food Wkrs., </em>C.A.7th (1976), 534 F.2d 735, 748 [17].</p>\n<p id=\"b989-5\">(4) The oral admonishments of union-members by a union officer, before and during the strife, without the taking of effective affirmative action to enforce those admonitions, were insufficient to absolve the respondent union of responsibility for disobeying the orders of this Court. <em>Laborers\u2019 Int'l. Union, Local 245 </em>(1975), 219 N.L.R.B. 142, 147, n. 9, affirmed C.A.4th (1976), 91 L.R.R.M. 2559.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-6\">(5) The tacit approval of acts of violence by its members during the pertinent labor disputes renders the respondent union responsible for the violative conduct of those members under the leadership of its correspondence Mr. Ellis, <em>White Oak Coal Company v. United Mine Workers, </em>C.A.6th (1963), 318 F.2d 591, 598 [4], although neither the respondents union nor Mr. Ellis was shown to have actually authorized those specific actions of such members, <em>ibid., </em>318 F.2d at 508 [3],</p>\n<p id=\"b989-7\">D. (1) \u201c * * * An affirmative proposition is little supported by negative observations. * * * \u201d <em>Brock </em>v. <em>United States, </em>C.A.5th (1967), 387 F.2d 254, 258, fn. 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-8\">(2) The negative testimony of the respondent Mr. Ellis, relating to the affirmative propositions advanced against him by witnesses for the petitioner, required the master, with the opportunity to observe and accredit the witnesses, to accord greater weight and probative value to such positive and affirmative evidence over such negative evidence. <em>Wallin v. Greyhound Corporation, </em>C.A.6th (1965), 341 F.2d 521, 523 [3],</p>\n<p id=\"b989-9\">E. (1) The respondents\u2019 disobedience of the orders of this Court was contemptuous thereof. <em>Garrigan v. United States, </em>C.C.A.7th (1908), 163 F. 16, 20 (relating to a charge of criminal contempt for violating a labor injunction), certiorari denied (1909), 214 U.S. 514, 29 S.Ct. 696, 53 L.Ed. 1063.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-11\">(2) Whether the actions of the respondent Mr. Ellis were wilful is irrelevant in determining whether the respondents are in civil contempt of the orders of this Court. <em>N. L. R. B. </em>v. <em>United Mine Workers of America, </em>C.A.6th (1968), 393 F.2d 265, 267, certiorari denied (1968), 393 U.S. 841, 89 S.Ct. 123, 21 L.Ed.2d 113, approving and confirming, <em>inter alia, </em>recommended conclusion of law (e) in the report of the special master.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-12\">(3) \u201c * * * [W]hen the punishment is wholly remedial, serves only the purposes of the complainant, and is not intended as a deterrent to offenses against the public, * * * \u201d it is properly a punishment for civil contempt. <em>McCrone v. United States </em>(1939), 307 U.S. 61, 64, 59 S.Ct. 685, 686, 83 L.Ed. 1108.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-13\">I hereby CERTIFY that I caused to be placed with the Postal Service on the hereinafter stated date respective copies of this report, addressed to Paul Elkind, Esq., assistant general counsel, National Labor Relations Board, 1717 Pennsylvania Avenue, Northwest, Washington, D. C. 20570 and to Cecil D. Branstetter, Esq., 200 Church Street, Fourth Floor, Nashville, Tennessee 37201, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-14\">I waive any compensation for my services and incurred no unreimbursed expenses in connection therewith. Having complied fully with the Court\u2019s order of January 20, 1977, I hereby request to be discharged as special master herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b989-15\">Respectfully submitted,</p>\n<p id=\"b989-16\">/s/C. G. Neese (C. G. Neese)</p>\n<p id=\"b989-17\">Special Master</p>\n<p id=\"b989-18\">June 28, 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"AkL\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"930\">*930</page-number>[[Image here]]</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
