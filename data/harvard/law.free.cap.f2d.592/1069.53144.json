The District Court held that it retained jurisdiction over the taxpayer\u2019s claim for refund, and gave judgment for the taxpayer. The government appeals. We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-15\">I. <em>The Facts.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1130-16\">The facts make interesting reading. The taxpayer (plaintiff-appellee), a former beauty contest winner, had been the recipient of gifts valued in excess of one million dollars which had been bestowed on her by Harold Kuhns, the founder and board chairman of Xerox Corporation. 'While accepting his favors, taxpayer became romantically involved with Allie Ianniello, reputed to be a member of the New York Cosa Nostra. Allie, upon discovering the wealth of the taxpayer, and with the help of his brother and their attorney, proceeded to swindle the taxpayer out of her money through investment ventures in \u201cbusinesses\u201d owned and operated by the Ianniellos. These investment ventures occurred in the 1965 tax year.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-17\">The taxpayer\u2019s involvement with Allie Ianniello became more coercive than romantic and, fearing for her life, the taxpayer left the state of New York. Thereafter, with the help of an attorney, she attempted to recoup her losses. Recovery efforts resulted in minimum returns at best. By 1969, four years after these 1965 investments, the taxpayer, failing to recoup the major part of her investments, located another attorney who threatened the Ianniellos with legal action unless the sum of the investments were repaid to the taxpayer.</p>\n<p id=\"b1130-18\">In that same year, 1969, the taxpayer filed a claim for refund of income taxes for the year 1965. The basis for the claim was that in 1965 she had suffered a theft loss within the meaning of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 165(e). On February 1, 1973, she filed this action for a refund of approximately $65,000 alleged to have been overpaid by reason of the theft loss. On April 10, 1973, the Commissioner issued a statutory notice of deficiency for 1965, in the net amount of approximately $50,000. The taxpayer timely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1071\">*1071</page-number>petitioned the Tax Court for a redetermination of the deficiency and, pending the Tax Court\u2019s redetermination, the District Court dismissed the taxpayer\u2019s suit for a refund.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-4\">The Tax Court held that the government was precluded by the statute of limitations from asserting a deficiency against the taxpayer and held that there was no deficiency. The taxpayer did not assert her claim of a 1965 theft loss before the Tax Court. She asked that court not to decide it. The Commissioner asked the Tax Court to decide the question, pointing out that the Tax Court did have jurisdiction to do so. The Tax Court\u2019s decision does not mention the question.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-5\">After the judgment of the Tax Court, the District Court reinstated the taxpayer\u2019s refund suit, holding that the Tax Court had acquired jurisdiction only to the extent of dismissing the government\u2019s deficiency claim on the basis of the bar of the statute of limitations and that, therefore, the District Court was not ousted of jurisdiction over the remaining issues. The District Court denied the government\u2019s motion to dismiss in which it was argued that under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7422(e), once the taxpayer had petitioned the Tax Court for redetermination of deficiency, the Tax Court also assumed complete jurisdiction over the taxpayer\u2019s tax liability for the year 1965. In addition to supporting the District Court\u2019s decision on jurisdiction, taxpayer argues, <em>inter alia, </em>that the government should be estopped to deny what it had alleged in its case against the Ianniellos.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-6\">The District Court held that the taxes paid for 1965 were recoverable by taxpayer as a theft loss deduction for that year pursuant to 16 U.S.C. \u00a7 165(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-7\">II. <em>The Jurisdiction of the District Court.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1131-8\">The District Court did not have jurisdiction. Under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7422(e), the District Court lost jurisdiction when the taxpayer filed her petition with the Tax Court to redetermine the deficiency in her income tax for the year 1965 asserted by the Commissioner in his notice of deficiency. That is what \u00a7 7422(e) requires. Section 7422(e) says that in such a case, \u201cthe district court . . . shall lose jurisdiction of the taxpayer\u2019s suit to whatever extent jurisdiction is acquired by the Tax Court of the subject matter of [the] taxpayer\u2019s suit for refund.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-11\">The key principle is stated by the Court in <em>Flora v. United States, </em>1957, 362 U.S. 145, 166, 80 S.Ct. 630, 641, 4 L.Ed.2d 623.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A5_\">Section 7422(e) of the 1954 Internal Revenue Code makes it apparent that Congress has assumed these problems [of dual jurisdiction] are nonexistent except in the rare case where the taxpayer brings suit in a District Court and the Commissioner then notifies him of an additional deficiency. Under \u00a7 7422(e) such a claimant is given the option of pursuing his suit in the District Court or in the Tax Court, <em>but he cannot litigate in both. </em>(Emphasis the Court\u2019s.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1131-12\">The taxpayer exercised her option by pursuing her suit in the Tax Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1131-13\">The Tax Court acquired jurisdiction to decide, not only whether the Commissioner\u2019s assertion of a deficiency was correct, but also whether Russell\u2019s claim that she had overpaid was correct. This is what 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6512(b) expressly provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1131-14\">\u201cOverpayment determined by the Tax Court. \u2014 (1) Jurisdiction to determine. \u2014 If the Tax Court finds that there is no deficiency and further finds that the taxpayer has made an overpayment of income tax for the same taxable year, ... in respect of which the Secretary . . . determined the deficiency . . . the Tax Court shall have jurisdiction to determine the amount of such overpayment . . .\u201d We cannot imagine clearer language.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1131-17\">In such a case, the Tax Court\u2019s decision is <em>res judicata </em>as to the year in question. <em>Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Sunnen, </em>1948, 333 U.S. 591, 597-98, 68 S.Ct. 715, 719, 92 L.Ed. 898:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1131-18\">It is first necessary to understand something of the recognized meaning and scope of <em>res judicata, </em>a doctrine judicial in origin. The general rule of <em>res judicata </em>applies to repetitious suits involving <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1072\">*1072</page-number>the same cause of action. It rests upon considerations of economy of judicial time and public policy favoring the establishment of certainty in legal relations. The rule provides that when a court of competent jurisdiction has entered a final judgment on the merits of a cause' of action, the parties to the suit and their privies are thereafter bound \u201cnot only as to every matter which was offered and received to sustain or defeat the claim or demand, but as to any other admissible matter which might have been offered for that purpose.\u201d <em>Cromwell v. County of Sac, </em>94 U.S. 351, 352, 24 L.Ed. 195. The judgment puts an end to the cause of action, which cannot again be brought into litigation between the parties upon any ground whatever, absent fraud or some other factor invalidating the judgment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1132-4\">******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1132-5\">Income taxes are levied on an annual basis. Each year is the origin of a new liability and of a separate cause of action. Thus if a claim of liability or non-liability relating to a particular tax year is litigated, a judgment on the merits is <em>res judicata </em>as to any subsequent proceeding involving the same claim and the same tax year.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1132-6\">There can be no question that when the taxpayer petitioned the Tax Court to redetermine the asserted deficiency, the Tax Court acquired jurisdiction to decide the entire gamut of possible issues that controlled the determination of the amount of tax liability for the year in question. A party cannot, in such a case, by failing to raise an issue, or by asking the court not to consider it, escape the <em>res judicata </em>effect of the decision. This is hornbook law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-7\">III. <em>Equitable Issues.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1132-8\">We have held that there is an exception to the foregoing well established rule, as applied to the Tax Court, because the Tax Court has no equity jurisdiction. <em>Morse v. United States, </em>9 Cir., 1974, 494 F.2d 876. <em>See also, Feistman </em>v. <em>C.I.R., </em>9 Cir., 1978, 587 F.2d 941.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-9\">The taxpayer argues, without much conviction, that she should be able to assert her claim in the District Court because she was forced into the Tax Court by reason of her inability to pay the asserted deficiency. This claim was answered by the Court in <em>Flora, supra, </em>362 U.S. at 175, 80 S.Ct. at 646:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1132-10\">A word should also be said about the argument that requiring taxpayers to pay the full assessments before bringing suits will subject some of them to great hardship. This contention seems to ignore entirely the right of the taxpayer to appeal the deficiency to the Tax Court without paying a cent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1132-11\">The taxpayer\u2019s other contention is equally without merit. When she cooperated with the government, it was in her interest to do so. She makes no claim that any government official told her that her cooperation would gain any tax benefits for her. The most that she claims is that the government has taken the position, in relation to the Ianniellos\u2019 tax liability, that they swindled her out of her money in 1965. The government does not dispute this. Its position, as to the taxpayer, is that she did not determine that she could not get her money back until later years. Indeed she did get some of it back after 1965. The government\u2019s theory is that, as to her, the theft loss deduction is to be made, not when the Ianniellos got the money, but when it became- apparent that she could not get it back \u2014 that this is when the \u201closs\u201d to which the law refers was ascertained. This is not, as taxpayer argues, in conflict with the government\u2019s position vis a vis the Ianniellos. It may or not be good law, but it is not the kind of behavior by the government that appeared in the cases on which Russell relies. <em>See Schuster v. C.I.R., </em>9 Cir., 1962, 312 F.2d 311; <em>Sun II Yoo v. I. &amp; N.S., </em>9 Cir., 1976, 534 F.2d 1325.</p>\n<p id=\"b1132-12\">We conclude that the District Court lost jurisdiction when the taxpayer filed her petition with the Tax Court, and did not get it back when the Tax Court decided her case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1133-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1073\">*1073</page-number>Reversed, with directions to vacate the judgment and dismiss the action.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b1133-5\">GRANT, District Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"AFa\">concurring:</p>\n<p id=\"b1133-6\">In concurring with the majority opinion, I wish, however, to comment on three areas: (1) the legislative history of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7422(e); (2) a potentially misleading case, and (3) 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7459(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b1133-7\">I\u2014 Both the Senate and House Reports<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on Section 7422(e) evidence two policies: (1) to give jurisdiction over the cause of action to only one court, and thereby prevent relitigation of identical issues, and (2) to give the taxpayer the choice of which court shall have jurisdiction. This choice was intended to be given to the taxpayer rather than the government. <em>Pfeiffer Company v. United States, </em>518 F.2d 124, 129 (8th Cir. 1975). In the case at bar, even if taxpayer would have paid the deficiency in order to preserve district court jurisdiction over the refund, the <em>Pfeiffer </em>case indicates that again her choice of forums to litigate the deficiency need not be recognized by the government. Under <em>Pfeiffer, </em>even if taxpayer pays the deficiency, the government \u201cmay \u2014but seemingly is not required to \u2014 bring a counterclaim\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in the district court. See also <em>Caleshu v. United States, </em>570 F.2d 711 (8th Cir. 1978). This view of the law might work to defeat the Congressional purpose of choice of forum. See Judge Heaney\u2019s concurring opinion in <em>Pfeiffer.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1133-8\">II\u2014 To prevent a recurrence of the taxpayer\u2019s present plight (of failing to make a timely appeal of her Tax Court decision in reliance upon the mistaken assumption that the district court had continuing jurisdiction), I would stress that, as the law stands now, all issues that can be raised before the Tax Court must be raised, and that once the Tax Court decision is final, there is no further recourse to a district court regarding non-equitable issues. Plaintiff has cited the case of <em>Falese v. United States, </em>26 A.F.T.R.2d 70-5940 (N.D.Ill.1970), for the proposition that the issues comprising the subject matter of a refund suit are divisible and that when one issue is presented to the Tax Court, that fact does not mean that all other issues from that year must necessarily follow the first issue into the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction. I would warn that such has proved to be a losing proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1133-12\">Ill \u2014 Finally, plaintiff\u2019s protest over the application of Section 7422(e)\u2019s ban on continuing district court jurisdiction can be appreciated here because of the fact that the Tax Court apparently did not consider anything beyond the threshold barrier of the statute of limitations. The pleadings before the Tax Court show that what actually happened was that the taxpayer requested that the government\u2019s claim of deficiency be dismissed with prejudice because of the statute of limitations, and that the taxpayer\u2019s refund claim be dismissed without prejudice so that the pending district court refund suit could proceed. The government opposed both motions for dismissal and reminded the Tax Court that it had jurisdiction to determine an overpayment and that the government was ready to proceed to trial on that issue. The Tax Court, however, thereupon rendered the following decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1133-13\">DECISION</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1133-14\">At the hearing in this case held at Portland, Oregon, on May 9, 1974, the parties admitted that the statutory notice was not mailed to the petitioner within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1074\">*1074</page-number>the time prescribed by law. Petitioner has pleaded the statute of limitations. Accordingly, it is hereby</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ABv\">DECIDED: That there is no deficiency in income tax or additions to tax under section 6651 of the Internal Revenue Code due from the petitioner for the taxable year ended December 31, 1965.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1134-4\">(signed) William H. Quealy</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Afsn\">Judge</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1134-5\">This all too brief entry by the Tax Court resolved the deficiency issue on the threshold barrier of the statute of limitations, but did not address the overpayment issue. Therefore, it is not clear whether the merits of either issue were ever litigated before the Tax Court. Apparently they were not.</p>\n<p id=\"b1134-6\">Section 7459(b) of 26 U.S.C. prescribes the duty of a Tax Court in rendering a decision:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1134-7\">(b) Inclusion of findings of fact or opinions in report. \u2014 It shall be the duty of the Tax Court and of each division to include in its report upon any proceeding its findings of fact or opinion or memorandum opinion. The Tax Court shall report in writing all its findings of fact, opinions, and memorandum opinions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1134-8\">Section 7459(b) appears to impose an affirmative duty on the Tax Court to put in writing all of its findings of fact and opinions. Furthermore, courts have held that the Tax Court is required to resolve all material issues properly raised before it and to make appropriate fact-findings upon such issues. <em>Transport Manufacturing &amp; Equipment Co. of Del. v. C.I.R., </em>374 F.2d 173 (8th Cir. 1967). Because of this duty to make written findings, an inference can be made that because the Tax Court\u2019s decision included no findings of fact regarding overpayment or theft deductions, the Tax Court did not consider that those issues were properly before it. If this is what actually occurred, then it would suggest that the Tax Court erred. When the petition for redetermination of deficiency was filed with the Tax Court, both the issue of deficiency, as well as any overpayment issue, were properly before the Tax Court and, regardless of the pending refund action, the Tax Court should have made findings regarding the computations basic to determinations of those issues. Unfortunately for plaintiff, however, the case at bar is an appeal from the judgment of the District Court for the District of Oregon, not an appeal from the 1974 decision of the Tax Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1133-9\">. Both the House and Senate Reports read in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1133-10\">. The result under subsection (e) is to give jurisdiction over the cause of action to only 1 court (2 courts may acquire jurisdiction under existing law), and to give the taxpayer the choice of which court shall have jurisdiction. The taxpayer, by filing a petition in the Tax Court, would cause that court to have sole jurisdiction, or, <em>by failing to file a petition in the Tax Court, would cause the district court or the Court of Claims to have sole jurisdiction . . . </em>(Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1133-17\">H.Rep.No.1337, 83d Cong., 2d Sess., p.
