We agree with the government that the district judge abused his discretion when he dismissed the indictment and when he suppressed some of the challenged evidence. Accordingly, we reverse and remand for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"A0q\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"AZS\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b915-19\">Agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation suspected that Fred Campagnuolo and some of his associates were conducting a gambling enterprise. On December 29, 1973, FBI agents secured a warrant to search Campagnuolo\u2019s apartment. The agents parked their vehicle on the street outside his apartment building. They observed that Campagnuolo was standing on the balcony of his apartment and appeared to be watching them. He reentered his apartment when the agents started their vehicle and circled the block. The agents then reparked their vehicle and went to the apartment. They knocked on the door, announced their identity, and said that they had a search warrant. After a delay of about 50 seconds, during which the agents repeated their announcement and threatened to knock the door down if it was not opened, Campagnuolo opened the door.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-20\">The agents entered the apartment and conducted a search. An agent noticed that one of the windows of the apartment was open and that the screen had been removed. He looked out the window and observed an envelope on the ground below. He retrieved the envelope and showed it to Campagnuolo, who denied any knowledge of it. The agents examined the envelope and found that it contained sheets of gambling information. The agents also discovered two telephones in Campagnuolo\u2019s apartment, both of which had been disconnected. An agent reconnected one of the telephones and, in a period of one hour and twenty minutes, received forty-two calls. Most of the callers either placed wagers or requested gambling information, which the agent attempted to provide. When asked about his identity, the agent gave the callers his true name; he did not inform them of his true occupation.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-21\">In 1975, a federal grand jury began investigating Campagnuolo and his associates. Carl Samuel \u201cKelley\u201d Aurillio appeared be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"856\">*856</page-number>fore the grand jury under a grant of immunity. Aurillio testified that he and Campagnuolo had been partners in a bookmaking operation during the 1973 football season. Aurillio made other statements, however, that tended to exculpate Campagnuolo and some of his associates. Aurillio stated that the partners obtained their \u201cline\u201d for each game from newspapers rather than by interstate telephone calls. He further testified that John Campagnuolo, a defendant-appellee in this case, was merely a bettor and not a participant in the bookmaking operation. In addition, Aurillio testified that, to the best of his personal knowledge, Michael Gougules, also a defendant-appellee in this case, had not participated in the bookmaking operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-4\">In June 1975, the grand jury handed down a three-count indictment against Fred Campagnuolo, John Campagnuolo, and Gougules. Count I charged them with conspiracy to violate 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1952 by using interstate telephone communications to carry on a gambling enterprise in violation of state law. Count II alleged that they violated \u00a7 1952 by using the interstate telephone facilities for gambling purposes. Count III charged them with using the interstate telephone facilities to transmit information assisting in the placing of wagers on sporting events in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1084. In December 1975, the district court dismissed the indictment on the ground that the government had improperly disclosed wiretap evidence to the grand jury. This Court reversed and remanded. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Campagnuolo, </em>5 Cir. 1977, 556 F.2d 1209.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-5\">In January 1978, on the day before trial was scheduled to begin, the government turned over to defense counsel certain evidentiary material: Fred Campagnuolo\u2019s statement denying knowledge of the gambling sheets contained in the envelope found outside his apartment during the 1973 search; a report of that search, including descriptions of the forty-two telephone calls received by the FBI agent who reconnected Campagnuolo\u2019s telephone; and a transcript of Aurillio\u2019s grand jury testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-8\">The defense counsel moved to suppress Fred Campagnuolo\u2019s statement because, under the district court\u2019s standing discovery order entered in July 1975, the government should have given the statement to defense counsel long before the eve of the trial. The defense counsel also moved to suppress the telephone calls received by the FBI agent, arguing that the agent\u2019s conduct violated the federal wiretap statutes, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510-2520, and that in any event the prosecutor violated his duty to turn over the information obtained by the reconnection of the telephone in accordance with the standing discovery order. Finally, counsel moved for the dismissal of the indictment because of the government\u2019s failure to give the defense counsel Fred Campagnuolo\u2019s statement, the evidence obtained by reconnection of the telephone, and Aurillio\u2019s grand jury testimony in accordance with the standing discovery order. The district judge granted both motions to suppress evidence and the motion to dismiss the indictment, rejecting the government\u2019s arguments that it had complied with the discovery order and that the FBI agent\u2019s conduct in reconnecting the telephone did not violate 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510-2520. The district judge clearly intended the dismissal to be with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-9\">On appeal, the government argues that its conduct did not violate the discovery order and that the reconnection of the telephone did not violate the federal wiretap statutes. In addition, the government asserts that, even if it did violate the discovery order, the district judge abused his discretion when he dismissed the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b916-11\">THE GOVERNMENT\u2019S ALLEGED VIOLATIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b916-12\">The standing discovery order issued by the trial judge in pertinent part is set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"857\">*857</page-number>forth in the margin.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This order is intended to promote the policies underlying the discovery provisions of Rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure <em>(see </em>Appendix) and the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>1963, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215, which bars the prosecutor from suppressing requested evidence in the government\u2019s possession that may be exculpatory to the defendant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b918-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"858\">*858</page-number>\n<em>A. Fred Campagnuolo\u2019s Statement</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b918-4\">Before the district judge, the government admitted that it had violated the standing discovery order when it failed to inform defense counsel of Fred Campagnuolo\u2019s statement denying knowledge of the envelope containing gambling slips. Furthermore, the government failed to argue that the discovery order did not encompass that statement. We reject the government\u2019s suggestion that this Court ignore these concessions. We are left, then, with the government\u2019s argument that the district judge should not have suppressed Fred Campagnuolo\u2019s statement because the government\u2019s noncompliance with the discovery order could not have prejudiced the appellees. This argument misconceives the district judge\u2019s broad discretion to administer sanctions for the violation of a valid discovery order. <em>See United States v. Bockius, </em>5 Cir. 1977, 564 F.2d 1193, 1196; <em>United States v. Valdes, </em>5 Cir. 1977, 545 F.2d 957, 961. We find no abuse of discretion where, as here, a district judge for prophylactic purposes suppresses evidence that, under a valid discovery order, the government should have disclosed earlier, even if the nondisclosure did not prejudice the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-5\">\n<em>B. Aurillio\u2019s Grand Jury Testimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b918-6\">The government asserts that the district judge erred when he found that the government violated a duty to make pretrial disclosure to the defendants of Aurillio\u2019s grand jury testimony. The government first contends that such pretrial disclosure is barred by the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500. The government next argues that the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of the due process clause in <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>1963, 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215, does not require such pretrial disclosure in this case. Therefore, concludes the government, the standing discovery order was invalid to the extent that it allowed discovery beyond the limitations of the Jencks Act. We agree with the government\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-10\">The Jencks Act provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b918-11\">(a) In any criminal prosecution brought by the United States, no statement or report in the possession of the United States which was made by a Government witness or prospective Government witness (other than the defendant) shall be the subject of subpena, discovery, or inspection until said witness has testified on direct examination in the trial of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-12\">(b) After a witness called by the United States has testified on direct examination, the court shall, on motion of the defendant, order the United States to produce any statement (as hereinafter defined) of the witness in the possession of the United States which relates to the subject matter as to which the witness has testified. If the entire contents of any such statement relate to the subject matter of the testimony of the witness, the court shall order it to be delivered directly to the defendant for his examination and use.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-13\">(e) The term \u201cstatement\u201d, as used in subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section in relation to any witness called by the United States, means\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b918-14\">(1) a written statement made by said witness and signed or otherwise adopted or approved by him;</p>\n<p id=\"b918-15\">(3) a statement, however taken or recorded, or a transcription thereof, if any, made by said witness to a grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-16\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500. The prosecutor\u2019s colloquy with the district judge clearly indicated that Aurillio was a prospective government witness, and the appellees make no argument to the contrary. The Jencks Act, therefore, would require the prosecutor to allow the defendants\u2019 counsel to examine Aurillio\u2019s grand jury testimony only after Aurillio had given his direct testimony at the trial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b919-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"859\">*859</page-number>In <em>Brady v. Maryland, </em>the Supreme Court held that due process forbids a prosecutor to suppress \u201cevidence favorable to an accused upon request . . . where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution\u201d. 373 U.S. at 87, 83 S.Ct. at 1196-7. As this Court has recently stated, <em>\u201cBrady </em>is not a discovery rule, but a rule of fairness and minimum prosecutorial obligation\u201d. <em>United States v. Beasley, </em>5 Cir. 1978, 576 F.2d 626, 630 (citing <em>United States v. Agurs, </em>1976, 427 U.S. 97, 107, 96 S.Ct. 2392, 2399-2400, 49 L.Ed.2d 342, 352).</p>\n<p id=\"b919-6\">This Court has interpreted <em>Brady </em>to require the government \u201cto produce <em>at the appropriate time </em>requested evidence which is materially favorable to the accused either as direct or impeaching evidence\u201d. Wil<em>liams v. Dutton, </em>5 Cir. 1968, 400 F.2d 797, 800, <em>cert. denied, </em>393 U.S. 1105, 89 S.Ct. 908, 21 L.Ed.2d 799 (emphasis added). Courts have suggested that in some circumstances the \u201cappropriate time\u201d for discovery is prior to trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b919-7\">It should be obvious to anyone involved with criminal trials that exculpatory information may come too late if it is only given at trial, and that the effective implementation of <em>Brady v. Maryland </em>must therefore require earlier production in at least some situations.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b919-8\"><em>United States v. Deutsch, </em>1974, S.D.N.Y., 373 F.Supp. 289, 290. <em>See, e. g., United States v. Pollack, </em>1976, 175 U.S.App.D.C. 227, 534 F.2d 964, 973-74, <em>cert. denied, </em>429 U.S. 924, 97 S.Ct. 324, 50 L.Ed.2d 292; <em>United States v. Houston, </em>1972, N.D.Ga., 339 F.Supp. 762, 764; Note, <em>The Prosecutor\u2019s Constitutional Duty to Reveal Evidence to the Defendant, </em>74 Yale L.J. 136, 145 (1964). On the other hand, other courts have maintained that <em>\u201cBrady </em>was never intended to create pretrial remedies\u201d. <em>United States v. Moore, </em>6 Cir. 1971, 439 F.2d 1107, 1108 (per curiam).'<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b919-13\">Aurillio\u2019s grand jury testimony contained exculpatory statements. That testimony falls within the ambit of <em>Brady. United States v. Herberman, </em>5 Cir. 1978, 583 F.2d 222, 227-29.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This Court is aware that, as an abstract matter, <em>Brady </em>might appear to modify the statutory standards applicable to the disclosure of grand jury testimony. Notwithstanding the Jencks Act, <em>Brady </em>might mandate that the prosecutor should have disclosed to the appellees Aurillio\u2019s grand jury testimony at some time prior to trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-14\">On several occasions, this Court has addressed this question of possible conflict between the Jencks Act and <em>Brady. See United States v. Anderson, </em>5 Cir. 1978, 574 F.2d 1347; <em>United States v. Dotson, </em>5 Cir. 1977, 546 F.2d 1151; <em>United States v. Scott, </em>5 Cir. 1975, 524 F.2d 465; <em>United States v. Wertis, </em>5 Cir. 1974, 505 F.2d 683, <em>cert. denied, </em>422 U.S. 1045, 95 S.Ct. 2662, 45 L.Ed.2d 697; <em>United States v. Frick, </em>5 Cir. 1973, 490 F.2d 666, <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"860\">*860</page-number>831, 95 S.Ct. 55, 42 L.Ed.2d 57; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>5 Cir. 1972, 458 F.2d 670, <em>cert. denied, </em>409 U.S. 888, 93 S.Ct. 195, 34 L.Ed.2d 145; <em>United States v. Montos, </em>5 Cir. 1970, 421 F.2d 215, <em>cert. denied, </em>397 U.S. 1022, 90 S.Ct. 1262, 25 L.Ed.2d 532. In each of these cases, this Court held that the prosecutor\u2019s compliance with the Jencks Act provided timely disclosure under <em>Brady. </em>Several of these cases contain broad language suggesting that the timing provisions of the Jencks Act do not conflict with <em>Brad</em>y<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In <em>Harris, </em>however, this Court recognized \u201cthat <em>Brady </em>and the Jencks Act might in some circumstances be in substantive conflict on the general issue of the production of government evidence\u201d. 458 F.2d at 677. Nonetheless, the Court in <em>Harris </em>held that the government\u2019s failure in that case to make pretrial disclosure of the grand jury testimony of a government witness did not violate due process because it did not prejudice the defendant. <em>Id. </em>at 676-77.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The <em>Harris </em>analysis comports with this court\u2019s recent recognition of the principle that <em>\u201cBrady </em>is not a discovery rule, but a rule of fairness and minimum prosecutorial obligation\u201d. <em>United States v. Beasley, </em>576 F.2d at 630.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-4\">Our prior cases might be read as holding that <em>Brady </em>and the timing provisions of the Jencks Act are compatible as a matter of law. Alternatively, they might hold that <em>Brady </em>would override the Jencks Act in cases where lack of pretrial discovery resulted in prejudice to the defendant \u201cof substantial Due Process character\u201d. <em>Harris, </em>458 F.2d at 677. <em>Compare United States v. Felts, </em>5 Cir. 1974, 497 F.2d 80, 82, <em>cert. denied, </em>419 U.S. 1051, 95 S.Ct. 628, 42 L.Ed.2d 646; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Kaplan, </em>3 Cir. 1977, 554 F.2d 577, 579-80; Comment, <em>The Prosecutor's Duty to Disclose: From </em>Brady <em>to </em>Agurs <em>and Beyond, </em>69 J.Crim.L. &amp; Criminology 197, 218-20 (1978). We need not choose between these competing approaches, however, because it is clear that the appellees were not prejudiced by the allegedly tardy disclosure of Aurillio\u2019s grand jury testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b920-10\">Aurillio\u2019s grand jury testimony would have been useful to the appellees prior to trial only because it indicates that Aurillio was a potential exculpatory witness for the defense. The defendants surely knew, however, that Aurillio was a potential witness and might give exculpatory testimony. Aurillio was a partner of Fred Campagnuolo and was acquainted with the other defendants. He was named in the indictment as an unindicted co-conspirator. In addition, in September 1975 the government sent a letter to Fred Campagnuolo\u2019s counsel informing him that Aurillio had given grand jury testimony that was exculpatory.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In December 1975, Aurillio was residing in the Palm Beach County Jail. To secure his presence at a suppression hearing in this case, the government sought, and the district judge granted, a Writ of Habeas Corpus Ad Testificandum. In the government\u2019s application for the writ, it referred to Aurillio as a material witness for the United States. The application and the writ are both contained in the record in this case, of course. Counsel for all defendants were present at the December 1975 suppression hearing. During that hearing, the prosecutor revealed that, based on Aurillio\u2019s testimony before the grand jury as an immunized witness, the government had de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"861\">*861</page-number>termined that it had insufficient evidence to bring a prosecution under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1955, which outlaws the operation of a gambling business by five or more persons that is illegal under state law. Record at 275-76, 284, 287-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-5\">It is not surprising, then, that before the district judge the defendants made no showing of any prejudice arising out of the government\u2019s failure to provide them with Aurillio\u2019s grand jury testimony until the day before the scheduled start of trial.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Furthermore, as this Court has stated, \u201cthe government is not obliged under <em>Brady </em>to furnish a defendant with information which he already has or, with any reasonable diligence, he can obtain himself\u201d. <em>United States v. Prior, </em>5 Cir. 1977, 546 F.2d 1254, 1259. <em>See United States v. Cravero, </em>5 Cir. 1976, 545 F.2d 406, 420, <em>cert. denied, </em>430 U.S. 983, 97 S.Ct. 1679, 52 L.Ed.2d 377. The government\u2019s timing of disclosure, then, did not violate <em>Brady. </em>It follows that the district court\u2019s standing discovery order requiring earlier disclosure was invalid as to Aurillio\u2019s grand jury testimony, since the order was not mandated by <em>Brady </em>and was barred by the Jencks Act.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b921-6\">\n<em>C. The Telephone Conversations</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ASv\">On the day before trial was scheduled to begin, the government presented to the counsel for Fred Campagnuolo the evidence of the forty-two telephone calls received by the FBI agent who reconnected Campagnuolo\u2019s telephone during the search of his. apartment. The district judge suppressed this evidence on two grounds. First, he determined that the evidence was obtained in violation of the wiretap provisions of Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968,18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510-2520. Second, he held that the failure to disclose the \u201cmanner and means\u201d by which the government obtained the evidence violated the standing discovery order.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-9\"><em>1. The wiretap issue. </em>Federal law provides that evidence obtained by law enforcement officers through the interception of wire or oral communications is inadmissible unless the officers obtained judicial authorization for the interception. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2515-2518. The district judge noted that the FBI never obtained judicial authorization for the agent\u2019s actions in reconnecting the telephone and receiving the calls. The judge then held that, because the agent\u2019s actions constituted an interception under Title III, the evidence of the calls must be suppressed. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b921-10\">In <em>United States v. Kane, </em>5 Cir. 1971, 450 F.2d 77, <em>cert. denied, </em>405 U.S. 934, 92 S.Ct. 954, 30 L.Ed.2d 810, a federal agent conducting a search of the premises of a suspected bookie under the authority of a valid warrant answered the suspect\u2019s phone for four hours, taking bets and dispensing gambling information. The defendant argued that the agent\u2019s conduct constituted an un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"862\">*862</page-number>authorized \u201cinterception\u201d under 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 605, the predecessor statute to Title III.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This Court summarily rejected the defendant\u2019s contention by citing the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in <em>United States v. Pasha, </em>7 Cir. 1964, 332 F.2d 193, <em>cert. denied, </em>379 U.S. 839, 85 S.Ct. 75, 13 L.Ed.2d 45, 450 F.2d at 84-85.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b922-4\">In <em>Pasha, </em>the Court held that \u201c[interception connotes a situation in which by surreptitious means a third party overhears a telephone conversation between two persons\u201d. 332 F.2d at 198. Therefore, held the Court, no \u201cinterception\u201d occurred when a federal agent conducting a valid search of the premises of a suspected bookie answered a ringing telephone, listened to what the caller had to say, and impersonated the intended recipient of the call. In support of this holding, the Court quoted a decision of the Supreme Court of New Jersey on the same issue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b922-5\">\u201cIn the case before us, there was no tampering with the established means of communication. Indeed the officer was the immediate party to the call. The bettor intended his words to reach the officer, albeit the bettor thought he was someone else. Thus the officer did not \u2018intercept\u2019 a message while it was <em>en route </em>to another; there was no other on the line.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b922-6\">332 F.2d at 198 (quoting <em>State v.

The government argues that nothing in Title III changes the <em>Pasha </em>holding that the actions of a police officer conducting a valid search who answers a ringing telephone do not constitute an \u201cinterception\u201d. We need not reach this contention to decide the wiretap issue in this case. While conducting a valid search, the agent in this case reconnected a disconnected telephone and received calls. Even if we assume that these actions constituted an \u201cinterception\u201d under Title III, it is clear that they did not violate that statutory scheme.</p>\n<p id=\"b922-11\">Title III provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b922-12\">It shall not be unlawful under this chapter for a person acting under color of law to intercept a wire or oral communication, where such person is a party to the communication .</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b922-13\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511(2)(c).

Violation of the discovery order. </em>The district court also suppressed the evidence of the telephone calls because the government had failed to adhere to the timetable of the standing discovery order in revealing the \u201cmanner and means\u201d by which the government obtained this evidence. In making this decision, the district judge apparently relied on paragraph A.(5) of the discovery order, which requires production of documents and other tangible objects the government intended \u201cto use as evidence at trial to prove its case in chief, or were obtained from or belonged to the defendant\u201d. The telephone calls are not tangible evidence, however. This evidence could be presented to the jury only through the testimony of the agent who received the calls.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We find no provision in the standing discovery order, then, that required the prosecutor to inform the appellees of the manner and means by which the government obtained this evidence. Furthermore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"864\">*864</page-number>because under the Jencks Act the agent\u2019s written report of the contents of the calls qualified as a \u201cstatement\u201d by a prospective government witness, the prosecutor could not be required to give the appellees a copy of the report until after the agent testified at trial. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500(a), (e)(1). In these circumstances, the district court abused its discretion when it suppressed the evidence of the telephone conversations.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-5\">DISMISSAL OF THE INDICTMENT</p>\n<p id=\"A1X8\">We held in Part II of this opinion that the government did not violate the duty of disclosure it owed to the appellees when, on the day before trial was scheduled to begin, it gave them the transcript of Aurillio\u2019s grand jury testimony and the FBI agent\u2019s report detailing the telephone calls the agent received on Fred Campagnuolo\u2019s telephone. In addition, we held that the agent\u2019s conduct involving these calls did not violate Title III. The only misconduct by the government that could support the district judge\u2019s dismissal of the indictment, then, was the government\u2019s failure to give timely disclosure of Fred Campagnuolo\u2019s statement denying knowledge of the envelope containing gambling slips that was found outside the window of his apartment. We find that omission to be an insufficient basis for dismissal of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b924-6\">The district judge\u2019s oral opinion dismissing the indictment details the frustrations he has experienced because of the United States Attorney\u2019s frequent violations of the standing discovery order in many cases. The opinion indicates that the judge recognized the seriousness of the sanction he imposed.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> His written order dismissing the indictment more succinctly covered the same terrain:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-11\">This Court was instrumental in the drafting of the<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Standing Discovery Order which has been in effect in this District since 1973. The Court is continuously presented with situations wherein the Government has not complied with the dictates of this order and is increasingly frustrated by the effect this non-compliance has upon the administration of justice in this District.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-12\">The Court does not find it necessary to decide whether any of the aforedescribed violations of the discovery order by the Government were intentional, for that is not the issue. Nor does the Court find it necessary to decide whether the defendants were in fact prejudiced by the Government\u2019s non-compliance in that the Court finds the nature of the Government\u2019s violations to be such that prejudice, is at least, inherently present. The Court concludes that the Government has failed to comply with three separate and distinct provisions of the Court\u2019s Standing Discovery Order and the Court\u2019s action in dismissing this Indictment represents an attempt by this Court to enforce the orders of this Court and to protect the rights of Defendants to the discovery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>materials to which they are entitled. Further the Court seeks to establish firmly in this case the underlying purpose for the Standing Discovery Order which is, basic fairness and justice.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b925-4\">Record at 452-53.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">The aims of the district judge were laudable. The supervisory powers of a district judge, however, allow him to impose the extreme sanction of dismissal of an indictment with prejudice only in extraordinary situations. <em>See </em>the thoughtful discussion in <em>United States v. Baskes, </em>1977, N.D. Ill., 433 F.Supp. 799, 804-07. For this reason, we have held that a district judge may dismiss an indictment with prejudice because of misconduct by the government only if that misconduct actually prejudiced the defendant. <em>United States v. Acosta, </em>5 Cir. 1976, 526 F.2d 670, <em>cert. denied, </em>426 U.S. 920, 96 S.Ct. 2625, 49 L.Ed.2d 373. The appellees made no argument before the district judge that the untimely disclosure of Fred Campagnuolo\u2019s statement prejudiced them. During oral argument before this Court, they admitted that none of the government\u2019s alleged violations of the discovery order redounded to their prejudice. We must disagree, then, with the district judge\u2019s conclusion that prejudice was \u201cinherently present\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">Because of the absence of any prejudice, we are constrained to reverse the district judge\u2019s dismissal of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"ABp\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-7\">APPENDIX: RULE 16</p>\n<p id=\"Arm\">(a) Disclosure of Evidence by the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-8\">(1) Information Subject to Disclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-9\">(A) Statement of Defendant. Upon request of a defendant the government shall permit the defendant to inspect and copy or photograph: any relevant written or recorded statements made by the defendant, or copies thereof, within the possession, custody or control of the government, the existence of which is known, or by the exercise of due diligence may become known, to the attorney for the government; the substance of any oral statement which the government intends to offer in evidence at the trial made by the defendant whether before or after arrest in response to interrogation by any person then known to the defendant to be a government agent; and recorded testimony of the defendant before a grand jury which relates to the offense charged. Where the defendant is a corporation, partnership, association or labor union, the court may grant the defendant, upon its motion, discovery of relevant recorded testimony of any witness before a grand jury who (1) was, at the time of his testimony, so situated as an officer or employee as to have been able legally to bind the defendant in respect to conduct constituting the offense, or (2) was, at the time of the offense, personally involved in the alleged conduct constituting the offense and so situated as an officer or employee as to have been able legally to bind the defendant in respect to that alleged conduct in which he was involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-12\">(B) Defendant\u2019s Prior Record. Upon request of the defendant, the government shall furnish to the defendant such copy of his prior criminal record, if any, as is within the possession, custody, or control of the government, the existence of which is known, or by the exercise of due diligence may become known, to the attorney for the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-13\">(C) Documents and Tangible Objects. Upon request of the defendant the government shall permit the defendant to inspect and copy or photograph books, papers, documents, photographs, tangible objects, buildings or places, or copies or portions thereof, which are within the possession, custody or control of the government, and which are material to the preparation of his defense or are intended for use by the government as evidence in chief at the trial, or were obtained from or belong to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-14\">(D) Reports of Examinations and Tests. Upon request of a defendant the government shall permit the defendant to inspect and copy or photograph any results or reports of physical or mental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>examinations, and of scientific tests or experiments, or copies thereof, which are within the possession, custody, or control of the government, the existence of which is known, or by the exercise of due diligence may become known, to the attorney for the government, and which are material to the preparation of the defense or are intended for use by the government as evidence in chief at the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-4\">(2) Information Not Subject to Disclosure. Except as provided in paragraphs (A), (B), and (D) of subdivision (a)(1), this rule does not authorize the discovery or inspection of reports, memoranda, or other internal government documents made by the attorney for the government or other government agents in connection with the investigation or prosecution of the case, or of statements made by government witnesses or prospective government witnesses except as provided in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-5\">(3) Grand Jury Transcripts. Except as provided in Rule 6 and subdivision (a)(1)(A) of this rule, these rules do not relate to discovery or inspection of recorded proceedings of a grand jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-6\">(c) Continuing Duty to Disclose. If, pri- or to or during trial, a party discovers additional evidence or material previously requested or ordered, which is subject to discovery or inspection under this rule, he shall promptly notify the other party or his attorney or the court of the existence of the additional evidence or material.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-7\">(d) Regulation of Discovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-8\">(1) Protective and Modifying Orders. Upon a sufficient showing the court may at any time order that the discovery or inspection be denied, restricted, or deferred, or make such other order as is appropriate. Upon motion by a party, the court may permit the party to make such showing, in whole or in part, in the form of a written statement to be inspected by the judge alone. If the court enters an order granting relief following such an ex parte showing, the entire text of the party\u2019s statement shall be sealed and preserved in the records of the court to be made available to the appellate court in the event of an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b926-10\">(2) Failure to Comply With a Request. If at any time during the course of the proceedings it is brought to the attention of the court that a party has failed to comply with this rule, the court may order such party to permit the discovery or inspection, grant a continuance, or prohibit the party from introducing evidence not disclosed, or it may enter such other order as it deems just under the circumstances. The court may specify the time, place and manner of making the discovery and inspection and may prescribe such terms and conditions as are just.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b917-7\">.

The government argues that it was not required to follow certain provisions of Paragraph C of the standing discovery order because those provisions were broader in scope than the requirements adopted by the Supreme Court in <em>Brady. </em>This argument is without merit. It is within the sound discretion of the district judge to make any discovery order that is not barred by higher authority.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b918-8\">.

The government asserts that in June 1975 it sent a disclosure letter to Gougules\u2019s counsel and to the Campagnuolos\u2019s joint counsel. These letters are not in the record, however. In September 1975, Fred Campagnuolo obtained separate counsel, and the government sent the letter referred to in the text to that new counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b921-7\">. During the hearing on the motion to dismiss the indictment, the district judge asked the counsel for Fred Campagnuolo whether the allegedly tardy disclosure of Aurillio\u2019s grand jury testimony had prejudiced his client. The counsel answered that \u201cas far as trial preparation, Your Honor, at this time I\u2019m not able to envision what prejudice \u2014 the only prejudice is the prejudice to the system of justice in the Southern District of Florida where this Court for many years, now, has taken a favorable step in providing for a standing discovery. order and those are supposed to be complied with\u201d. Record at 479. The counsel for John Campagnuolo adopted this argument, also. Record at 481. The counsel for Gougules argued only that, had he known of Aurillio\u2019s grand jury testimony, he would have subpoenaed Aurillio as a defense witness. Record at 480. That counsel failed to show that Aurillio was not available to testify, however, and there are indications in the record that Aurillio was a prospective government witness. During the oral argument before this Court, counsel for all appellees admitted that they had shown no prejudice resulting from the government\u2019s timing of disclosure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b921-12\">. The appellees contend that the government made no specific argument before the district court that the Jencks Act barred that court\u2019s order requiring early discovery of Aurillio\u2019s grand jury testimony, Even if that was the case, that omission would not result in a waiver of the government\u2019s objection to the dismissal of the indictment. The prosecutor did argue that dismissal was improper because the delay in disclosure did not prejudice the appellees. As our discussion in Part III <em>infra </em>makes clear, that argument raised the proper legal standard for deciding a motion to dismiss an indictment.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b922-8\">. 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 605 provided in part that \u201cno person not being authorized by the sender shall intercept any communication and divulge or publish the existence, contents, substance, purport, effect, or meaning of such intercepted communication to any person . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b922-15\">.

We realize that \u00a7 2511(2)(c)\u2019s exception for an interception by a law enforcement officer who is a party to a communication might seem to condone serious intrusions into privacy. Suppose, for example, that in response to a request by a police officer the telephone company electronically reroutes calls away from a telephone of a suspected bookie to a telephone manned by that officer. Under this scheme, a caller who dialed the bookie\u2019s telephone number would be connected with the officer\u2019s telephone. In answering the calls, the officer would pose as a bookie and, if his suspicions were accurate, would receive evidence of bookmaking. Since the officer would literally be a party to those calls, \u00a7 2511(2)(c) might appear to exempt his conduct from the prohibitions of Title III. It would seem that the officer\u2019s conduct would not escape the prohibition of unreasonable searches and seizures provided by the Fourth Amendment, however. <em>Cf.

Justice Douglas contended that the Arkansas court\u2019s interpretation of the \u00a7 2511(2)(c) exception would allow the police to avoid the prohibitions of Title III by \u201cbecoming technical \u2018parties\u2019 to the conversations\u201d, 415 U.S. at 999, 94 S.Ct. at 1601, a fear we share, <em>see </em>note 13 <em>supra. </em>Because Justice Douglas contended that Congress intended \u00a7 251 l(2)(c) to be interpreted \u201cin light of existing constitutional standards\u201d, <em>id. </em>at 998, 94 S.Ct. at 1601, he found it</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ajx\">unthinkable that a carefully drawn legislative plan can consistently with constitutional principles be frustrated in a manner leaving no legal protection for the privacy and security of telephone conversations as long as callers can be successfully deceived.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b923-9\"><em>Id. </em>at 999-1000, 94 S.Ct. at 1062. In this case, however, we must look not to any general intent of Congress that the courts interpret Title III consistently with the Constitution, but to Congress\u2019s specific intent to preserve the result in <em>Pasha </em>by allowing a police officer conducting a valid search to become a party to telephone calls on the premises searched. Because the appellees in this case do not challenge the conduct of the law enforcement officers on Fourth Amendment grounds, we do not reach that issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b923-10\">. The agent\u2019s written report detailing the substance of the calls was hearsay, of course, and thus was not independently admissible to prove these conversations.

The district judge\u2019s oral opinion provided in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-8\">Frankly, it disturbs me more than I can tell you to announce the ruling that I am about to make. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-9\">I cannot point the finger of fault at anybody or anything except the obvious lack of continuity of government counsel and the lack of assiduous concern and action in response to the Court\u2019s orders. Unfortunately, the Department of Justice does not have career men but their lawyers come and go, and everytime there is a change in the administration there is a substantial turnover and all kinds of problems. For example, in this Court in the last week, I have received three motions either seeking leave to withdraw as counsel for a defendant or for other relief, including a dismissal of the indictment because of the unavailability of the Assistant United States Attorney for conference and the failure of the government to produce material that has been required to be produced by this standing discovery order, and I have written three letters to our newly appointed United States Attorney and to the Attorney General of the United States to try to call attention to the problems that we are experiencing in this Court, that I am experiencing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b924-14\">It is ordered and adjudged that the indictment and each and every count thereof as it pertains to each of these defendants is hereby dismissed for the reasons previously stated.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
