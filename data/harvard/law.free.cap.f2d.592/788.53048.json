(\u201cGulf Coast News\u201d) and Trans World America, Inc. (\u201cTWA\u201d) appeal their convictions under 18 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"790\">*790</page-number>U.S.C. \u00a7 371 for conspiring knowingly to use a common carrier to ship obscene materials interstate, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1462, and knowingly to transport obscene matter interstate for the purpose of sale or distribution, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1465. Sanders, Walter and Gulf Coast News also challenge their convictions for substantive violations of sections 1462 and 1465.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellants all allege an unconstitutional search and seizure and attack the district court\u2019s jury instructions on obscenity; appellant Walter further contends that he \u201cwas not shown to possess the requisite scienter.\u201d We find these assertions to be without merit and therefore affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b850-4\">\n<em>I. Facts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b850-5\">According to the testimony at trial, on September 15, 1975, Richard Larson, the manager of appellant Gulf Coast News, located in St. Petersburg, Florida, ordered an employee to deliver 12 cartons, containing a series of 8 mm. films entitled \u201cDavid\u2019s Boys,\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> to Greyhound Bus Package Express in St. Petersburg for shipment to Atlanta. The packages had a nonexistent return address and named a fictitious corporation, \u201cD and L Distributors,\u201d as shipper. Described as containing printed matter, they were sent on a \u201cwill call\u201d basis to \u201cLeggs, Inc.,\u201d another fictitious company. \u201cLegs\u201d was the nickname of a female employee at appellant TWA\u2019s Atlanta headquarters. When the cartons reached Atlanta, Greyhound forwarded them to a branch station located near L\u2019Eggs Products, Inc. (\u201cL\u2019Eggs\u201d), a manufacturer of women\u2019s hosiery and regular customer of Greyhound Package Express. After Greyhound informed L\u2019Eggs of the shipment, Michael Horton, a L\u2019Eggs Products employee, came to the terminal, opened one of the cartons and discovered that it contained sexually explicit movies. Horton returned to the L\u2019Eggs office and described the package\u2019s contents to a superior, William Fox. Concerned that his company might be implicated in the transportation of pornographic films, Fox drove to the Greyhound station and brought the 12 cartons to the L\u2019Eggs office. He and several other employees opened all the packages and found individu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"791\">*791</page-number>al boxes of film. The top of each film box showed the name \u201cDavid\u2019s Boys\u201d and a drawing of two nude males embracing and kissing; on the back of each were the title of the individual movie and a detailed description, in explicit terms, of the bizarre homosexual acts depicted in the film. Pox then telephoned the FBI, explained the nature of the films and asked \u201cthem to come out and take the materials away.\u201d The FBI procured the films on October 1, 1975, and subsequently viewed them on a projector at its offices. No warrant was obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-4\">Appellants Walter and Sanders, who jointly operated appellants TWA and Gulf Coast News, were indicted along with both corporations under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 371 on one count of conspiring knowingly to use a common carrier to ship obscene materials interstate, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1462, and knowingly to transport obscene matter interstate for the purpose of sale and distribution, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1465. Gulf Coast News, Walter and Sanders were also charged with five counts of substantive violations of section 1462 and five substantive violations of section 1465.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The jury convicted TWA of conspiracy and returned guilty verdicts as to Walter, Sanders and Gulf Coast News on all eleven counts. The district court fined TWA $10,000, Gulf Coast News $33,000 and sentenced both Walter and Sanders to three years in prison on each count, to run concurrently.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-5\">\n<em>II. The Constitutionality of the Search and Seizure</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b851-6\">Appellants first urge that the district court committed reversible error in failing to suppress the five films admitted in evidence at trial. Since appellants TWA and Gulf made no pretrial motion to suppress, they cannot raise this issue on appeal. <em>United States v. Bush, </em>5 Cir., 1978, 582 F.2d 1016, 1018. Though appellants Sanders and Walter each made a timely motion to suppress and return the films, the district court sought to determine at the outset whether they had standing to challenge the constitutionality of the search and seizure. To establish such standing under traditional Fourth Amendment analysis, a defendant must either show presence on the searched premises at the time of search, allege a proprietary or possessory interest in the premises or objects searched or be charged with an offense that includes as an essential element possession of the seized evidence at the time of the contested search and seizure. <em>See Brown v. United States, </em>411 U.S. 223, 229, 93 S.Ct. 1565, 1569, 36 L.Ed.2d 208 (1973); <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>5 Cir., 1974, 505 F.2d 931, 939-40. \u201cGenerally, a defendant satisfies the standing requirement if he has an adequate possessory interest in the place or object searched to give rise to a reasonable expectation of privacy.\u201d <em>United States v. Hunt, supra, </em>505 F.2d at 938.</p>\n<p id=\"b851-11\">In denying appellants\u2019 suppression motion, the district judge held that \u201cshipping or causing or suffering to be shipped by a common carrier . with a fictitious name given for the shipper as well as the fictitious name given for the consignee or addressee, amounts to a relinquishment or abandonment of any reasonable expectation of privacy. Or, stated another way, it seems to me that it was reasonably foreseeable that what actually occurred would occur. That is to say, that there was substantial likelihood that the material would be misdelivered and fall into the hands of some third party, as actually happened in this case, where it would be opened and its privacy, if it had any, invaded.\u201d There is merit in the district court\u2019s conclusion. However, the Supreme Court has recently \u201cdispens[ed] with the rubric of standing . by frankly recognizing that this aspect of the analysis belongs more properly under the heading of substantive Fourth Amendment doctrine,\u201d <em>Rakas v. Illinois, </em>- U.S. -, 99 S.Ct. 421, 429, 58 L.Ed.2d 387 (1978) so we will focus \u201con the extent of a particular defendant\u2019s rights under the Fourth Amendment, rather than on any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"792\">*792</page-number>theoretically separate, but invariably intertwined concept of standing.\u201d Id., - U.S. at -, 99 S.Ct. at 428.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-5\">A. The Search by L\u2019Eggs Products Employees</p>\n<p id=\"b852-6\">Appellants Sanders and Walter argue that the L\u2019Eggs Products employees, in opening the 12 cartons and examining their contents without a warrant, conducted an unconstitutional search. The Fourth Amendment\u2019s warrant requirement, of course, is intended solely \u201cas a restraint upon the activities of sovereign authority,\u201d <em>Burdeau v. McDowell, </em>256 U.S. 465, 475, 41 S.Ct. 574, 576, 65 L.Ed. 1048 (1921), and \u201ca search . . conducted by a private individual for purely private reasons, . does not fall within the protective ambit of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d <em>United States v. Lamar, </em>5 Cir., 1977, 545 F.2d 488, 489-90; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>5 Cir., 1972, 457 F.2d 697, 699; <em>Barnes v. United States, 5 </em>Cir., 1967, 373 F.2d 517, 518. However, if under the circumstances of the case the private party \u201cacted as an \u2018instrument\u2019 or \u2018agent\u2019 of the government,\u201d the ostensibly \u201cprivate\u201d search must meet the amendment\u2019s standards. <em>United States v. Bomengo, </em>5 Cir., 1978, 580 F.2d 173, 175. <em>See Lustig v. United States, </em>338 U.S. 74, 79, 69 S.Ct. 1372, 1374, 93 L.Ed. 1819 (1949). Before the L\u2019Eggs Products employees ever contacted the FBI, they had on their own initiative taken the shipment of films from the bus terminal, opened the cartons, examined the individual film boxes and ascertained the nature of the films. Since \u201cthere is no indication in the record\u201d that in so doing the L\u2019Eggs employees \u201cacted at the behest or suggestion, with the aid, advice or encouragement, or under the direction or influence of the F.B.I.,\u201d we conclude that these activities constituted a private search, beyond the scope of the Fourth Amendment. <em>United States v. Clegg, </em>5 Cir., 1975, 509 F.2d 605, 609.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-8\">B. FBI Acceptance of the Films</p>\n<p id=\"b852-9\">Nevertheless, Sanders and Walter contend that the FBI unconstitutionally seized the films, by accepting them from the L\u2019Eggs employees without obtaining a warrant. In making this assertion, they rely principally on the Eighth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Kelly, </em>1976, 529 F.2d 1365. There, an employee of a common carrier discovered that a ripped-open carton of goods contained sexually explicit books and magazines and called the FBI, which sent an agent who examined several of the magazines and retained samples, without obtaining a warrant. Although the <em>Kelly </em>court said that the common carrier\u2019s search was private, it held that the Government\u2019s subsequent acceptance of the fruits constituted a seizure requiring a warrant, \u201cunless there are special circumstances which excuse compliance with the . . warrant requirement,\u201d decided that no exception to that requirement applied and concluded that the warrantless \u201cseizure\u201d was \u201cso unreasonable as to necessitate the operation of the exclusionary rule.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1371.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-12\">The result in <em>Kelly </em>conflicts with the reasoning implicit in a long line of private search decisions by the Supreme Court and this circuit. In every such case, introducing the fruits of a private search as evidence was impossible unless the private party had at some point surrendered the articles to the Government. Yet neither we nor the Supreme Court have ever held that government acceptance of those articles constitutes a seizure requiring compliance with the warrant requirement, even in cases where no exception to that requirement would have covered the Government\u2019s action. <em>See, e. g., Burdeau v. McDowell, </em>256 U.S. 465, 41 S.Ct. 574, 65 L.Ed. 1048 (1921); <em>United States v. Lamar, </em>5 Cir., 1977, 545 F.2d 488; <em>United States v. Blanton, </em>5 Cir., 1973, 479 F.2d 327; <em>Barnes v. United States, </em>5 Cir., 1967, 373 F.2d 517. Thus, we decline to accept the <em>Kelly </em>court\u2019s analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b852-13\">In <em>United States v. Sherwin, </em>9 Cir., 1976, 539 F.2d 1, the Ninth Circuit, sitting en banc, also rejected the <em>Kelly </em>rationale. <em>Sherwin </em>also involved a common carrier employee who examined the contents of damaged packages, discovered sexually explicit books and called the FBI, which sent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>agents who removed two books from the shipment, without a warrant. Citing <em>Kelly, </em>the <em>Sherwin </em>defendants argued on appeal that \u201ca seizure to which the fourth amendment is applicable occurred . . . when the F.B.I. agents obtained the two books\u201d from the common carrier, <em>id. </em>at 7, but the Ninth Circuit did \u201cnot regard the government\u2019s acceptance of materials obtained in a private search to be a seizure\u201d and concluded that \u201cthe fourth amendment [is] not implicated when articles discovered in a private search [are] voluntarily turned over to the government.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We agree with the Ninth Circuit\u2019s reasoning. Under the circumstances, we hold that the FBI\u2019s acceptance of the \u201cDavid\u2019s Boys\u201d films from the L\u2019Eggs employees was not a seizure within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-6\">C. Viewing of the Films</p>\n<p id=\"Af9\">Appellants Sanders and Walter further assert, basing their argument on another Eighth Circuit case, <em>United States v. Haes, </em>1977, 551 F.2d 767, that the Government conducted an additional unconstitutional search by viewing the films on a movie projector without obtaining a warrant. In <em>Haes, </em>the employee of a common carrier, seeking to identify the consignee of a shipment, opened a package, discovered sexually explicit films and contacted the FBI, which sent two agents with a movie projector to the common carrier\u2019s office, where the films were screened without first obtaining a warrant. Declaring that \u201cthe inquiry must be whether the government\u201d thereby undertook \u201cany new or different searches,\u201d the Eighth Circuit said that the Government\u2019s viewing of the films \u201cchanged the nature of the search,\u201d because the private search had involved no such screening, and held that the search was illegal, since no exception to the warrant requirement applied. <em>Id. </em>at 773-74.</p>\n<p id=\"b853-11\">Unlike <em>Haes, </em>however, where the private party \u201chad not viewed the films and had not attempted to make a decision as to whether or not they were obscene,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 771, the L\u2019Eggs employees were able to make \u201ca determination of possible obscenity prior to turning the films over to the FBI,\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>id. </em>at 772, by examining the individual boxes containing the films. In this case, the legend \u201cDavid\u2019s Boys\u201d and a cartoon of two nude males kissing and embracing appeared on one side of each film box; the other side carried the title of the individual film and a detailed description, in language of the utmost explicitness, of the bizarre homosexual acts depicted in the movie.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Under these circumstances, since <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"794\">*794</page-number>the L\u2019Eggs employees so fully ascertained the nature of the films before contacting the authorities, we find that the FBI\u2019s subsequent viewing of the movies on a projector did not \u201cchange the nature of the search\u201d and was not an additional search subject to the warrant requirement.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> We have held that the reopening and reinspection of a bag by government authorities following a private search does not constitute a separate, independent search requiring a warrant. <em>United States v. McDaniel, </em>5 Cir., 1978, 574 F.2d 1224, 1226-27; <em>United States v. Blanton, </em>5 Cir., 1973, 479 F.2d 327, 328. These decisions support our conclusion on this issue, for in our view, \u201cmuch less than reopening and reinspection of the box and its contents was the activity of the FBI\u201d here.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Pryba, </em>1974, 163 U.S.App.D.C. 389, 399, 502 F.2d 391, 401.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>See also United States v. Ford, </em>10 Cir., 1975, 525 F.2d 1308, 1312.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b855-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>\n<em>III. Walter\u2019s Scienter</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b855-5\">Appellant Walter contends that there was insufficient evidence to sustain his conviction, because the Government failed to establish a \u201cclose nexus\u201d between him and \u201ca specific shipment of proved obscene matter\u201d and because there was no evidence as to scienter. This assertion is meritless, as there was ample evidence to support the jury\u2019s finding that Walter knowingly used a common carrier to ship obscene materials interstate, knowingly transported obscene matter interstate for the purpose of sale or distribution and knew the obscene nature of the films shipped interstate.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-6\">According to the testimony at trial, Walter and Sanders jointly operated an extensive network of adult cinemas, bookstores and distribution warehouses, which included appellants TWA and Gulf Coast News. Ernest Golden, who had served as accountant and bookkeeper for these various enterprises, testified that he received instructions from both Walter and Sanders when keeping accounts and preparing tax returns for a number of corporations, including TWA and Gulf Coast News. William Boshell, who succeeded Golden as accountant, testified that Walter and Sanders both supplied him with the business records of the various corporations. He said that Walter, Sanders and all the corporations had their offices at TWA and added that he was paid with a TWA check for services rendered to the other businesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-7\">John Catoe, an employee of Walter and Sanders, related at trial that both men told him in 1973 that they were planning a new corporation to distribute sexually explicit materials and that Sanders later stated that this corporation was TWA. According to Catoe, he and all other TWA employees received work instructions from both Walter and Sanders. Catoe also said that when the two men sent him to Florida to manage a new bookstore in June 1975, they explained that Gulf Coast News had been established to supply their Florida operations. In addition, Catoe stated that Walter gave him expense money and ordered him to follow the directions of Richard Larson, the manager of Gulf Coast News, whom Catoe had met at TWA when Larson was being trained. Ronald Bowman, the Gulf Coast News employee who delivered the \u201cDavid\u2019s Boys\u201d films to Greyhound\u2019s St. Petersburg terminal, testified that on one visit to the Gulf Coast News warehouse Sanders was introduced as the man \u201c[y]ou will be working for\u201d and that on another occasion Walter was introduced as Sanders\u2019 partner. Bowman also recalled that Richard Larson described the two as partners and identified as theirs the desks in the back of the warehouse. Finally, Carol Maxey, Sanders\u2019 former girl friend, testified that Sanders told her that he and Walter jointly owned a number of businesses, including Gulf Coast News.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-11\">Given the foregoing testimony describing Walter\u2019s central role in the management of TWA, Gulf Coast News and other companies involved in the distribution and sale of hardcore pornography, we do not believe that \u201cthe jury must necessarily have had a reasonable doubt\u201d that he possessed the requisite scienter, <em>United States v. Warner, </em>5 Cir., 1971, 441 F.2d 821, 825, <em>cert. denied, </em>404 U.S. 829, 92 S.Ct. 65, 30 L.Ed.2d 58 (1971). Accordingly, we conclude that there was sufficient evidence to support Walter\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-12\">\n<em>III. The District Court\u2019s Instructions on Contemporary Community Standards</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b855-13\">Finally, appellants challenge the district court\u2019s jury instructions regarding the community standards element of the definition of obscenity. They contend that <em>Pinkus v. United States, </em>436 U.S. 293, 98 S.Ct. 1808, 56 L.Ed.2d 293 (1978) and our subsequent decision in <em>United States v. Bush, supra, </em>required the trial judge expressly to charge the jury not to consider children in determining the contemporary standards of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>\u201cthe average person of the community as a whole.\u201d We reject appellants\u2019 expansive reading of <em>Pinkus </em>and <em>Bush </em>and find no error in the district court\u2019s instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">In <em>Pinkus, </em>the trial judge had charged the jury that, in ascertaining community standards, \u201c \u2018you are to consider the community as a whole, young and old, educated and uneducated, the religious and the irreligious, men, women and <em>children, </em>from all walks of life\u2019.\u201d <em>Pinkus v. United States, supra, </em>436 U.S. at 296, 98 S.Ct. at 1811 (emphasis added). The Supreme Court elected \u201cto take this occasion to make clear that children are not to be included for these purposes as part of the \u2018community\u2019 as that term relates\u201d to the definition of obscenity and therefore held that \u201cit was error to instruct the jury that [children] were a part of the relevant community.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1812. Similarly, in <em>Bush </em>the district court had told the jury that \u201cyou are to consider the community as a whole, <em>young and old, </em>educated and uneducated, religious and the irreligious.\u201d (emphasis added) In holding that this charge constituted reversible error, we reasoned that inclusion of \u201c[t]he phrase \u2018young and old\u2019 . . . provides a jury ample freedom to consider children, and thus does not completely avoid the danger, emphasized in <em>Pinkus, </em>that \u2018the adult population [will be reduced] to reading only what is fit for children.\u2019 \u201d (citation omitted) 582 F.2d at 1021-22.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">Here, however, unlike the instructions in <em>Pinkus </em>and <em>Bush, </em>the trial judge\u2019s charge did not prescribe jury consideration of \u201cchildren\u201d or \u201cyoung people\u201d in determining community standards. The district court told the jurors to judge the obscenity of the films by whether their \u201cpredominant appeal . viewed in [their] entirety, is to the prurient interest of <em>the average person of the community as a whole, </em>or the prurient interest of a deviant sexual group, as the case might be, and is so patently offensive that it is utterly without redeeming social value.\u201d (emphasis added) The judge further explained that \u201c[w]hether the predominant theme or purpose of the material is an appeal to the prurient interest of the \u2018average person of the community as a whole\u2019 is a judgment which must be made in light of contemporary standards as would be applied by the average person with an <em>average and normal attitude toward, and an average interest in, sex.\u201d </em>(emphasis added) This instruction adequately directed jury consideration to the contemporary standards of adults and thereby avoided the danger emphasized in <em>Pinkus </em>and <em>Bush.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b856-9\">We have carefully examined appellants\u2019 remaining assertions<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> and conclude that they are meritless. Accordingly, we affirm the judgments of conviction as to all appellants.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b850-6\">.

Today the Court holds that the government may take possession of 12 cartons containing 871 films, view the films two months later, retain them for yet another two months \u2014 without obtaining a warrant at any point \u2014 if the films are the fruit of a private search. The majority reaches the conclusion that the FBI\u2019s acquisition of the films in this case falls short of a \u201cseizure\u201d without considering the first amendment interest at stake when expressive matter is taken out of circulation by the government. \u201cThe Fourth Amendment . must not be read in a vacuum\u201d. <em>Roaden v. Kentucky, </em>1973, 413 U.S. 496, 501, 93 S.Ct. 2796, 37 L.Ed.2d 757. In my <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>view, the approach of the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals in <em>United States v. Kelly, </em>1976, 529 F.2d 1365, represents the proper accommodation of the first and fourth amendments. I would reverse the defendants\u2019 convictions on the ground that the films were seized in violation of the fourth amendment and, therefore, were illegally admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">The majority presents the facts accurately but not completely. A longer look at the events that occurred once the employees of L\u2019Eggs Products, Inc. notified the FBI of the receipt of the shipment of films leads me to the conclusion that the defendants retained a constitutionally protectible interest in the films that was impermissibly intruded upon by the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">On September 26, 1977, Michael Horton, area manager for L\u2019Eggs, pried upon one of twelve packages, which were so unusually securely wrapped and reinforced that they did not look \u201cnormal\u201d to him. He discovered that the carton contained film boxes with various sexual scenarios described on the covers. Horton passed on this information to his branch manager, William Fox. Fox then went to the Greyhound terminus, informed the Greyhound employee in charge that the boxes did not belong to L\u2019Eggs, but took them with him anyway, without, however, paying the collect charges. Later, Fox informed FBI agent Mandyk of the incident. Mandyk told Fox to put the cartons aside until he arrived. He also asked the L\u2019Eggs employees to obtain the name of anyone who called to inquire about the packages.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-8\">Meanwhile, the defendants made several attempts to find their shipment. One of the defendants called Greyhound to report that the packages were missing. He put a tracer on the shipment, leaving his name and telephone number with Greyhound. During the next few days several of the defendants visited the Greyhound station. Although the assistant terminal manager knew that the packages had been taken to the L\u2019Eggs office, on the instructions of the FBI he did not provide the defendants with this information. Instead, he told the FBI about the inquirers. The defendants also called the L\u2019Eggs office. They, too, denied that they had the shipment.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-10\">Five days after Fox called the FBI, two agents arrived at the L\u2019Eggs office and took possession of the packages and their entire contents. Two months later Agent Mandyk screened each of the 871 films on an office projector. There were twenty-five title films; the remaining 846 films were copies. Another two months elapsed before the FBI turned the films over to the United States Attorney\u2019s office. Over a year later the indictments were returned. Of the twenty-five title films, the government charged that five were obscene.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-12\">The major teaching of the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in the obscenity area is that some form of judicial procedure \u201cdesigned to focus searchingly on the question of obscenity\u201d must precede governmental interference with material arguably within the protection of the first amendment. <em>See Heller v. New York, </em>1973, 413 U.S. 483, 489, 93 S.Ct. 2789, 37 L.Ed.2d 745; <em>A Quantity of Books v. Kansas, </em>1964, 378 U.S. 205, 210, 84 S.Ct. 1723, 12 L.Ed.2d 809; <em>Marcus v. Search Warrant of Property, </em>1961, 367 U.S. 717, 732, 81 S.Ct. 1708, 6 L.Ed.2d 1127. Because the FBI did not apply to a magistrate for a warrant at any point, the only judicial determination of obscenity was made at the trial on October 21, 1977 \u2014 over two years after the 871 films were taken out of circulation by the government. Yet the majority relegates to a footnote the defendants\u2019 contention that there was an illegal prior restraint. <em>See </em>note 10 of the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b857-13\">I must assume from the majority\u2019s dismissal, without discussion, of the issue of prior restraint that it agrees with the government that there is no first amendment interest at stake in this case. Before this Court, the government argued that the films were not entitled to the protection of the first amendment because they were fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>tively distributed. When taken, the films were neither being sold nor exhibited to the general public; hence, the government reasons, the public\u2019s first amendment right of access to nonobscene matter was not infringed. To support its contention that films enjoy no special constitutional status unless they are available to the general public, the government relies on language in a decision of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. \u201cThis was strictly an underground operation in hard core pornography with clandestine storage facilities not intended to be available to the public . . . The \u2018setting\u2019 then is hardly such as to presumptively invoke first amendment protection.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Cangiano, 2 </em>Cir. 1974, 491 F.2d 906, 913, cert. denied, 419 U.S. 904, 95 S.Ct. 188, 42 L.Ed.2d 149.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">It is, of course, true that the procedural safeguards required by the first amendment vary with \u201cthe nature of the materials seized and the setting in which they are taken\u201d. <em>Roaden v. Kentucky, </em>1973, 413 U.S. 496, 503, 93 S.Ct. 2796, 2801, 37 L.Ed.2d 757. A prior adversary hearing must be held before a large quantity of expressive material is seized by the government for the purpose of destruction. <em>See A Quantity of Books v. Kansas, </em>1964, 378 U.S. 205, 84 S.Ct. 1723, 12 L.Ed.2d 809; <em>Marcus v. Search Warrant of Property, </em>1961, 367 U.S. 717, 81 S.Ct. 1708, 6 L.Ed.2d 1127; <em>Lee Art Theatre v. Virginia, </em>1968, 392 U.S. 636, 88 S.Ct. 2103, 2104, 20 L.Ed.2d 1313 (per curiam). \u201c[Sjeizing films to destroy them or to block their distribution or exhibition is a very different matter from seizing a single copy of a film for the <em>bona fide </em>purpose of preserving it as evidence in a criminal proceeding.\u201d <em>Heller v. New York, </em>1973, 413 U.S. 483, 492, 93 S.Ct. 2789, 2794, 37 L.Ed.2d 745. Such a seizure is permissible if a neutral magistrate issuing the warrant determines that there is probable cause to believe that the film is obscene and an adversary hearing is available promptly after the seizure.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">When films are not subject to absolute suppression, in the sense of destruction, and the public interest in free circulation of the films is attenuated, less stringent procedural limitations on governmental action may be justified. This does not mean, however, that films furtively distributed to a small cadre of customers lose all constitutional protection and may be treated by the government as if they were contraband or ordinary instruments of a crime. The protection of the first amendment cannot turn solely on the size of the audience that expressive matter will reach. History teaches that the first amendment is concerned not only with the public\u2019s right of access but also with the right of unpopular and small minorities to express their views. Nor should first amendment protection hinge on the method of dissemination, for unpopular minority views are most likely to be disseminated in a furtive and clandestine fashion. <em>See United States v. Alexander, </em>8 Cir. 1970, 428 F.2d 1169, 1175; Note, <em>The Right to an Adversary Hearing on the Issue of Obscenity Prior to the Seizure of Furtively Distributed Films, </em>69 Mich.L.Rev. 913, 926-40 (1971).</p>\n<p id=\"b858-8\">Indeed, the question before the Second Circuit Court of Appeals in <em>Cangiano </em>was not whether the films were presumptively under the protection of the first amendment. The FBI obtained a warrant before seizing the material and an adversary hearing was available upon request by the defendant. The Court merely held that the \u201csetting\u201d was not such as to invoke the requirements of a prior adversary hearing before seizure. I do not know any cases, certainly not in this Circuit, holding that the taking of furtively distributed films raises no first amendment concerns at all. Such a proposition would be startling in light of the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Heller v. New York, </em>1973, 413 U.S. 483, 93 S.Ct. 2789, 37 L.Ed.2d 745. There, a single copy of a film was seized. Because other copies were available for screening to the public, there was no restriction on the public\u2019s right of access. Yet, the Court held that the copy could be seized as evidence only if the government observed strict pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"799\">*799</page-number>cedural safeguards.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cThe necessity for a prior judicial determination of probable cause will protect against gross abuses, while the availability of a prompt judicial determination in an adversary proceeding following the seizure assures that difficult marginal cases will be considered in light of First Amendment guarantees\u201d. 413 U.S. at 493, 93 S.Ct. at 2795.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">I have elaborated on decisions in the area of obscenity and prior restraints to demonstrate that the defendants had a legitimate first amendment interest in the films at the time they were taken by the FBI. I do not decide whether the restraint imposed in this case was so extensive that an adversary hearing should have been held before the films were taken. It is unnecessary to decide that question because the government did not observe the minimum procedural safeguards demanded by the Supreme Court in <em>Heller. </em>I point out, however, that unlike <em>Heller </em>the amount of material taken by the FBI in this case must be termed \u201cmassive\u201d. The retention of 846 copies far exceeds the requirements of officers seeking to pursue criminal charges. Moreover, we do not know whether the films were earmarked for storage in a warehouse or whether they were on the threshold of dissemination. One cannot assume, therefore, that the FBI\u2019s actions did not block the orderly distribution of the films. And in that circumstance, the Supreme Court has implied that the requirements of <em>A Quantity of Books </em>must be met. <em>Heller </em>v. <em>New York, </em>1973, 413 U.S. at 492, 93 S.Ct. 2789.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-9\">Given the special constitutional character of the items taken by the FBI, I see two mutually supporting reasons that compel application of the exclusionary remedy in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b859-10\">In the first place, the first amendment is an independent source of restrictions upon the power of the police to take expressive material. For example, because of first amendment concerns, a film cannot be seized as an incident to a lawful arrest. <em>Roaden v. Kentucky, </em>1973, 413 U.S. 497, 93 S.Ct. 2796. This is true even though the fourth amendment is generally understood to permit the seizure of items during a lawful arrest. <em>Chimel v. California, </em>1969, 395 U.S. 752, 89 S.Ct. 2034, 23 L.Ed.2d 685. As the Court explained in <em>Roaden, </em>the seizure of a copy of a film \u201cby a police officer, without the authority of a constitutionally sufficient warrant, is plainly a form of prior restraint\u201d. 413 U.S. at 504, 93 S.Ct. at 2801. \u201cThe seizure proceeded solely on the police officer\u2019s conclusions that the film was obscene; there was no warrant. Nothing prior to seizure afforded a magistrate an opportunity to \u2018focus searchingly on the question of obscenity.\u2019 \u201d 413 U.S. at 506, 93 S.Ct. at 2802. Thus, to supply the necessary judicial determination of obscenity, the Supreme Court harnessed the fourth amendment procedural guarantee of a neutral magistrate.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b859-11\">Functionally, the government\u2019s acceptance of the films in this case resembles a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>\u201cseizure\u201d resulting in a prior restraint. It is a nonjudicially imposed suppression of expressive matter. Like a seizure \u201cproceedpng] solely on the police officer\u2019s conclusions\u201d, the acceptance and retention of the films wholly frustrated the exercise of first amendment rights without any searching inquiry by a magistrate into the merits of the first amendment claim. It is imperative, therefore, to view the acquisition of these films by the FBI as a \u201cseizure\u201d subject to the procedural guarantees of the fourth amendment.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\">The suppression of the films as evidence is also justified under traditional fourth amendment doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">I start from the premise that the defendants had a constitutionally protectible privacy interest in the packages before they were discovered by the employees of L\u2019Eggs. The district court held that shipping material by means of a common carrier to a fictitious consignee amounted to a relinquishment or abandonment of any reasonable expectation of privacy. The majority agrees with this conclusion. <em>See </em>page 791 of the majority opinion. The increased likelihood that the parcel would be misdelivered cannot be equated with an abandonment of all reasonable expectations of privacy. Misdelivered packages are usually returned; indeed, they are usually returned unopened. The careful manner in which the films were wrapped in individually sealed containers as well as the use of a fictitious cover name for the addressee demonstrates, instead, a strong desire to maintain the defendants\u2019 interest in privacy, to avoid the contents getting into the wrong hands, and to continue ownership of the films or a possessory interest in the films until their delivery into the right hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-8\">The initial search of these films was by private parties and was, therefore, outside the scope of the fourth amendment. <em>Burdeau </em>v. <em>McDowell, </em>1921, 256 U.S. 465, 41 S.Ct. 574, 65 L.Ed. 1048. A search, however, is merely the first step in an invasion of privacy that ends with the introduction in court of incriminating evidence. When the initial search is conducted by private parties, the question remains whether governmental conduct after that point amounts to an independent invasion of the right of privacy controlled by the standards of the fourth amendment. <em>See generally </em>Note, <em>Private Searches and Seizures, </em>90 Harv.L.Rev. 463 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b860-9\">The majority also does not hold that fourth amendment issues were automatically exhausted once the initial private search was completed. The Court scrutinizes separately whether the government\u2019s viewing of the films discovered in the private search was an additional \u201cdifferent\u201d search, concluding that when the FBI agent screened films, the obscene content of which had already been ascertained by the employees of L\u2019Eggs, he \u201cdid not \u2018change the nature of the search<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u2019 \u201d. The majority refuses, however, to test the government\u2019s acquisition of the films against the same standard. Without examining the nature of the FBI\u2019s actions in taking and retaining the fruits of the private search, the Court holds that it was not a \u201cseizure\u201d; it was no more than a passive acceptance of an accomplished fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-10\">\u25a0 The government\u2019s acquisition of the fruits of the private search must be termed a \u201cseizure\u201d because it interfered with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"801\">*801</page-number>defendants\u2019 interest in the films in a new and different way. \u201cIt constituted a deprivation of the defendants\u2019 property interests\u201d. <em>See </em>Note, <em>Private Searches and Seizures, supra </em>at 469. The defendants had a legitimate possessory interest in the films acquired by the FBI until a judge, jury, or neutral magistrate issuing a warrant established probable obscenity. They had, therefore, a reasonable expectation of freedom from governmental interference with these films. \u201cLegitimation of expectations of privacy by law must have a source outside of the Fourth Amendment, either by reference to concepts of real or personal property law or to understandings that are recognized and permitted by society. One of the main rights attaching to property is the right to exclude others, see W. Blackstone, Commentaries, book II, Ch. I, and one who owns or lawfully possesses . . . property will in all likelihood have a legitimate expectation of privacy by virtue of this right to exclude.\u201d <em>Rakas v. Illinois, </em>1978, - U.S. -, 99 S.Ct. 421, 58 L.Ed.2d 387, 401, n. 12. This expectation is protected by the fourth amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-8\">It is true that when the employees of L\u2019Eggs took the packages from the common carrier and opened them, the defendants\u2019 ordinary privacy interest in the packages, in the sense of their desire to insulate the contents of the packages from the eyes of others, was infringed. That interest was not affected in any new way by the FBI\u2019s observance of the contents of the packages at the L\u2019Eggs office.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> But the defendants\u2019 retained a possessory interest in the films themselves, because they had a reasonable expectation that the packages would be retrieved after misdelivery or returned by the private parties to the common carrier. They also had a reasonable expectation that the films would be returned to them by the government pending a judicial determination of obscenity. Thus, they had a right to exclude the government from taking possession of the films. When the FBI appropriated the films, it abruptly and completely interfered with these legitimate expectations. The appropriation of the films was, therefore, a \u201cseizure\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-10\">The majority contends, nevertheless, that the Eighth Circuit\u2019s characterization, in <em>Kelly, </em>of the government\u2019s acceptance of the films as a \u201cseizure\u201d contradicts a long line of decisions by the Supreme Court and this Circuit. None of the cases cited by the majority, except <em>Sherwin v. United States, </em>9 Cir. 1976, 539 F.2d 1, addresses the taking of material presumptively protected by the first amendment. And it is worth noting that, in <em>Sherwin, </em>the FBI immediately obtained a warrant to seize a shipment of books after it accepted two copies of printed material discovered in the private search. Furthermore, none of the cases cited by the majority undertakes a separate fourth amendment analysis of the government\u2019s acquisition of the items discovered in the private search.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-11\">Over fifty years ago the Supreme Court held in <em>Burdeau v. McDowell, supra, </em>over a dissent by Justices Brand\u00e9is and Holmes, that papers stolen by a thief and turned over to the government could be used as evidence at trial. The Court did not explicitly consider whether the government\u2019s acceptance of the papers was a seizure. Commentators have cast doubt on the continued vitality of the <em>Burdeau </em>rule in its broadest sense. It permits the government to accomplish circuitously what it could not accomplish directly. In other words, it is the twin of the \u201csilver platter\u201d doctrine that allowed federal prosecutors to use illegal evidence independently obtained by state and local officers. <em>See generally </em>Baade, <em>Illegally Obtained Evidence in Criminal and Civil </em>Cases: <em>A Comparative Study of a Classic Mismatch, </em>II, 52 Tex.L.Rev. 621, 661 (1974); Note, <em>The Fourth Amendment Right of Privacy: Mapping the Future, </em>53 Va.L.Rev. 1314, 1336-59 (1969). The \u201csilver platter\u201d doctrine was abandoned nearly thirty years after <em>Burdeau </em>was decided. <em>Elkins v. United States, </em>1960, 364 U.S. 206, 80 S.Ct. 1437, 4 L.Ed.2d 1669. Moreover, when <em>Burdeau </em>was decided, there were few justifications for warrantless seizures. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"802\">*802</page-number>\u201cThe failure of <em>Burdeau </em>to subject the government\u2019s acceptance of privately discovered objects to fourth amendment analysis gave the police a desirable freedom of action. Under current fourth amendment doctrine, the exceptions to the warrant requirement . . . permit the police to take immediate action where their protective and law enforcement duties most demand it.\u201d Note, <em>Private Searches and Seizures, supra, </em>at 469.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">The Fifth Circuit cases cited by the majority are primarily concerned with whether there was a \u201cseparate or additional <em>search </em>\u201d by the government. <em>See United States v. Blanton, </em>5 Cir. 1973, 479 F.2d 327, 328 (emphasis added); <em>United States v. Lamar, </em>5 Cir. 1977, 545 F.2d 488. The majority argues, however, that the introduction into evidence of the fruits of the private search would have been impossible in each of these cases unless the government\u2019s acceptance of the articles turned over by the private parties was implicitly immunized from the fourth amendment. Yet in each of the cases the actual seizure of the items can be justified under traditional exceptions for warrantless seizures. For example, in <em>Lamar, </em>an airport official discovered heroin in a bag left by a passenger at the airport. He showed the contents of the bag to the police. When the passenger reclaimed the bag later that night, he was arrested. The bag could have been taken into possession by the police as an incident to a lawful arrest.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b862-9\">In this case, the warrantless seizure cannot be justified under existing exceptions to the warrant clause. The employees of L\u2019Eggs had no authority to consent to the government\u2019s appropriation of the presumptively lawful contents of the package. The seizure cannot be justified under the plain view doctrine. <em>See United States v. Kelly, </em>8 Cir. 1976, 529 F.2d at 1372-73. There were no exigent circumstances necessitating immediate action. The FBI had ample opportunity to secure a warrant on the basis of an affidavit by either the FBI agents or the employees of L\u2019Eggs. The seizure was, therefore, unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-10\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-11\">When evidence is seized in violation of the fourth amendment, the constitutional remedy is the suppression of the illegally obtained evidence. The exclusion of the films as evidence, rather than the return of the films to the owners, is the proper remedy in this case. This is true even though the source for characterizing government action as a seizure is primarily the first amendment<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and even though the principal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number>interest infringed in this case is a possessory one.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> When the government obtains films discovered in a private search and retains them, without the knowledge of the owner, for a considerable period of time, the remedy of return comes too late. The owners did not know where the films were. Indeed, the government took pains to ensure that the defendants would not be able to locate the films. The defendants could not ask the government to return the films until they were informed that the government had taken possession of their packages. This information was conveyed, at the earliest, more than a year after the films were acquired by the FBI.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Moreover, the Supreme Court has implicitly recognized, in <em>Roaden, </em>that the exclusionary rule is the most effective deterrent to unlawful government action affecting freedom of expression. Observing that the \u201c \u2018use by government of the power of search and seizure as an adjunct to a system for the suppression of objectionable publications is not new. . . 413 U.S. at 506, 93 S.Ct. at 2802, <em>citing Marcus v. Search Warrant of Property, </em>1961, 367 U.S. 717, 729, 81 S.Ct. 1708, 6 L.Ed.2d 1127, the Court reversed a conviction based on the admission into evidence of films seized incident to a lawful arrest. Therefore, I would reverse the convictions of the defendants in this ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-10\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-11\">I would also reverse the convictions of the defendants on the ground that the FBI conducted an independent search, prohibited by the fourth amendment, after acquiring the films.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-12\">Relying on language in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Haes, </em>8 Cir. 1977, 551 F.2d 767, the majority holds that the screening of the films on a projector at the office of the FBI was not a separate, independent search because the L\u2019Eggs employees, unlike the private searches in <em>Haes, </em>had already ascertained the nature of the films from the box covers and were able to make \u201ca determination of possible obscenity prior to turning the films over to the FBI.\u201d 551 F.2d at 772. The \u201csense impressions or legal conclusions\u201d of the employees of L\u2019Eggs have no place in determining whether the FBI agents conducted a new or different search. <em>See United States v. Haes, </em>551 F.2d at 773 (Webster, J., dissenting). The question whether the films were obscene bears only on the issue of probable cause to search and seize the films; and that determination must be made by a neutral magistrate issuing a warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b863-13\">Nor can I agree with the majority that the FBI\u2019s viewing of the films on a screen was merely a continuation of the private parties\u2019 observation of the box covers because, as it turned out, the covers accurately reflected their contents. The two-month <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"804\">*804</page-number>hiatus between the private search and the governmental screening negates any assumption that one continuous search took place. <em>Cf. Coolidge v. New Hampshire, </em>1971, 403 U.S. 443, 458, 464, 91 S.Ct. 2022, 29 L.Ed.2d 564. Each of the cases cited by the majority deal, instead, with governmental viewing of material immediately after being called to the scene of the private search by the private parties. <em>See United States v. McDaniel, </em>5 Cir. 1978, 574 F.2d 1224; <em>United States v. Blanton, </em>5 Cir. 1973, 479 F.2d 327; <em>United States v. Pryba, </em>1974, 163 U.S.App.D.C. 389, 399, 502 F.2d 391, 401; <em>United States v. Ford, </em>10 Cir. 1975, 525 F.2d 1308, 1312. Second, as in <em>Haes, </em>the FBI\u2019s actions in viewing the films two months later must be characterized as \u201cinitiating and carrying out their own inspection of the films for their own purposes.\u201d 551 F.2d at 771. If the descriptions on the box covers are an infallible guide to the contents of the films there would have been no need to retain the films for two months before making them available to the United States Attorney\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-4\">Contrary to the majority, I see no basis for distinguishing the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>United States v. Chadwick, </em>1977, 433 U.S. 1, 97 S.Ct. 2476, 53 L.Ed.2d 538, from the instant case. See note 7 of the majority opinion. In <em>Chadwick, </em>the Supreme Court held that the FBI could not search the contents of a footlocker after it took exclusive custody of the item without obtaining a warrant. Before the FBI took exclusive possession of the items in this case, the L\u2019Eggs employees had viewed the film boxes but had not opened the boxes or viewed their contents. True, there was probable cause to believe that the boxes contained obscene films. But in <em>Chadwick, </em>too, there was probable cause to believe, that the footlocker contained contraband\u2014 and the search validated this assumption. In this case, therefore, as in <em>Chadwick, </em>a judicial warrant must be obtained before the containers can be searched.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">VI.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-8\">The <em>Burdeau </em>rule has spawned much critical literature.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Today, the Court extends that rule into an area where the constitutional requirements of the fourth amendment are to be \u201caccorded the most scrupulous exactitude\u201d. <em>Stanford v. Texas, </em>1965, 379 U.S. 476, 485, 85 S.Ct. 506, 13 L.Ed.2d 431. Placing the government\u2019s acceptance of expressive materials outside the scope of the fourth amendment, by \u201ccasting] the government in the role of a passive receiver . absolve[s] the government of any first amendment responsibilities or restrictions . . . [It] allows for the possibility of government-sanctioned private censorship without judicial supervision.\u201d Note, <em>Private Searches and Seizures, supra </em>at 467. In short, the majority rule frustrates the Supreme Court\u2019s efforts to utilize the fourth amendment as a source of procedural guarantees aimed at controlling governmental action that affects freedom of expression. The approach of the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals in <em>Kelly, </em>which subjects the government\u2019s taking of expressive materials discovered in a private search to the scrutiny of the fourth amendment, properly guards both the first amendment rights and the privacy interests of absent third parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-10\">Therefore, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b859-6\">. The first articulation of the view that furtively distributed films are entitled to no first amendment protection was in a district court opinion, <em>United States v. Pryba, </em>D.D.C.1970, 312 F.Supp. 466. There, too, a warrant was obtained before seizure of the films. The decision of the district court was upheld by the District of Columbia Court of Appeals on the alternative theory that the requirements of <em>Heller </em>were satisfied. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Pryba, </em>1974, 163 U.S.App.D.C. 389, 412-13, 502 F.2d 391, 404-05.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b859-7\">. The Supreme Court has also held that the first amendment imposes its own, more stringent limitations on obtaining and executing a search warrant. A judicial warrant for the seizure of a film may not be issued \u201csolely upon the conclusory assertions of the police officer without any inquiry by the justice of the peace into the factual basis for the officer\u2019s conclusions.\u201d <em>Lee Art Theatre, Inc. v. Virginia, </em>1968, 392 U.S. 636, 637, 88 S.Ct. 2103, 2104, 20 L.Ed.2d 1313 (per curiam); <em>Marcus v. Search Warrant of Property, </em>1961, 367 U.S. 717, 731-32, 81 S.Ct. 1708, 6 L.Ed.2d 1127. Furthermore, where books are seized, a heightened degree of specificity in a search warrant\u2019s description of \u201cthings to be seized\u201d is required. <em>Stanford v. Texas, </em>1965, 379 U.S. 476, 85 S.Ct. 506, 13 L.Ed.2d 431. \u201cBut where the special problems associated with the First Amendment are not involved ... a more \u2018reasonable particularity\u2019 ... is permissible\u201d. <em>Berger </em>v. <em>New York, </em>1967, 388 U.S. 41, 98, 87 S.Ct. 1873, 1904, 18 L.Ed.2d 1040. (Harlan, J., dissenting).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b860-6\">. Professor Monahan suggests a similar analysis with respect to warrantless arrests. Viewing the first amendment as a source of restrictions upon the power of the police to seize persons as well as things, he argues that the police should be prohibited from arresting those committing offenses in their presence when the offenders are exhibitors or distributors of arguably first amendment protected matter. \u201cFunctionally, an arrest resembles a nonjudicially imposed injunction against certain conduct; . . . here, there is not even the barest judicial inquiry before the damage is done.\u201d Monahan, First Amendment \u201cDue Process\u201d, 83 Harv.L.Rev. 518, 538 (1970).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b860-12\">. Although I believe that the FBI\u2019s examination of the films at the L\u2019Eggs\u2019 office was not an independent \u201csearch\u201d subject to the fourth amendment, I cannot agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the later screening of the films at the office of the FBI was merely a continuation of the private search. <em>See </em>text pp. 803-804 infra.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b861-12\">. <em>See </em>note 4 <em>supra.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b862-6\">. The FBI\u2019s acceptance of a bag containing a silencer, discovered in a private search at the airport, in <em>United States v. Blanton, </em>5 Cir. 1973, 479 F.2d 327, was also \u201creasonable\u201d because it was incident to a lawful arrest and because exigent circumstances justified the warrantless seizure. 479 F.2d at 328. Thus, other circuits have scrutinized the reasonableness of governmental takings of objects in a private search directly under the fourth amendment. <em>See, e. g., United States v. Ogden, </em>9 Cir. 1973, 485 F.2d 536, 540; <em>United States v. Tripp, </em>9 Cir. 1972, 468 F.2d 569, 570, <em>cert. denied, </em>1973, 410 U.S. 910, 93 S.Ct. 965, 35 L.Ed.2d 272.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b862-7\">. Many courts, including a panel of this Circuit, have held that \u201c \u2018[wjhen materials are seized in violation of the first amendment, the appropriate remedy is return of the seized property, but not its suppression as evidence at trial\u2019 \u201d. <em>United States v. Bush, </em>5 Cir. 1978, 582 F.2d 1016, 1021. <em>See also United States v. Sherwin, </em>9 Cir. 1976, 539 F.2d 1, 8 n. 11; <em>United States v. Cangiano, </em>2 Cir. 1972, 464 F.2d 320, 328, <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>1973, 413 U.S. 913, 93 S.Ct. 3047, 37 L.Ed.2d 1023, <em>on remand, </em>2 Cir., 491 F.2d 905, <em>cert. denied, </em>1974, 418 U.S. 934, 94 S.Ct. 3223, 41 L.Ed.2d 1171; <em>Tyrone, Inc. v.

These cases are concerned with the seizure of expressive matter pursuant to a warrant but without a prior adversary hearing. The courts have reasoned that the exclusionary rule does not apply where a seizure is defective for lack of an adversary hearing because \u201cthe primary right involved is the public\u2019s First Amendment right of access, rather than the defendant\u2019s Fourth Amendment immunity from unreasonable search and seizure\u201d. <em>Huffman v. United States, </em>1972, 152 U.S.App.D.C. 238, 244, 470 F.2d 386, 392.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-13\">At least one court has recognized, however, that the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Heller </em>and <em>Roaden </em>may obliterate any distinction between violations of the first and fourth amendments when a seizure of expressive matter is defective for lack of a determination of probable obscenity by a neutral magistrate. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"803\">*803</page-number><em>United States v. Pryba, </em>1974, 163 U.S.App.D.C. 389, 402, 502 F.2d 391, 404 n. 97.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b863-7\">. In <em>Sherwin, </em>the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals suggested that \u201cwhen objects found in a private search are turned over to the government, then, only the property interests of the owner are implicated. A motion for return of the objects is a proper means of asserting these interests\u201d. 539 F.2d at 8, n. 10. Because, according to the Sherwin court, \u201c \u2018the principal object of the Fourth Amendment is the protection of privacy rather than property,\u2019 \u201d <em>Warden v.

On the contrary, recent Supreme Court decisions have emphasized that there is no abstract concept of privacy and that the concept of legitimate property interests can define more concretely the scope of the fourth amendment. <em>See, e. g.
