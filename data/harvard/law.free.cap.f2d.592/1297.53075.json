Its factual merits are not involved, so that \u2014 mercifully\u2014we are spared recounting the pitiful details of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1299\">*1299</page-number>gross and brutal murder which the evidence amply shows this habeas petitioner committed. The only points before us concern the manner in which the jury that imposed his death penalty was constituted. Suffice it to say that if any crime merits such punishment, it is thoroughly deserved by Burns. Nevertheless, a faithful observance of Supreme Court authority forbids its imposition here, and it falls to us to say so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-5\"><em>Witherspoon </em>provides that a venireman can be struck for cause only when he is \u201cirrevocably committed, before the trial has begun, to vote against the penalty of death regardless of the facts and circumstances that might emerge in the course of the proceedings.\u201d 391 U.S. 510, 522 n.21, 88 S.Ct. 1770, 1777 n.21, 20 L.Ed.2d 776. The Court further defined this footnote holding by acknowledging a state\u2019s power to exclude veniremen who</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ACh8\">made unmistakably clear (1) that they would <em>automatically </em>vote against the imposition of capital punishment without regard to any evidence that might be developed at the trial of the case before them, or (2) that their attitude toward the death penalty would prevent them from making an impartial decision as to the defendant\u2019s <em>guilt</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"ADs\">(Emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-6\">Footnote 21 also states that if the voir dire testimony indicates that veniremen were excluded on \u201cany broader basis . the death sentence cannot be carried out even if applicable statutory or case law in the relevant jurisdiction would appear to support only a narrower ground of exclusion.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1359-7\">In its next significant opinion on the <em>Witherspoon </em>issue, <em>Boulden </em>v. <em>Holman, </em>394 U.S. 478, 89 S.Ct. 1138, 22 L.Ed.2d 433 (1969), the Court, again through Mr. Justice Stewart, invalidated yet another death sentence. Several veniremen had been excused on such typical grounds as that they did not \u201cbelieve in\u201d or had \u201ca fixed opinion against\u201d capital punishment. Although the petitioner there had complained below only of a confession assertedly coerced, he raised the <em>Witherspoon </em>question in brief and oral argument before the Court. Elevating its mainly footnote expressions in <em>Witherspoon </em>to text, the Court struck down the death sentence imposed by a jury so constituted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-10\">Next came <em>Maxwell v. Bishop, </em>398 U.S. 262, 90 S.Ct. 1578, 26 L.Ed.2d 221 (1970), a per curiam decision reiterating the principles laid down in <em>Witherspoon </em>and <em>Boulden </em>and striking down the death sentence where veniremen had been excused for \u201cconscientious scruples about imposing the death penalty\u201d or for not believing in it. And in <em>Davis v. Georgia, </em>429 U.S. 122, 97 S.Ct. 399, 50 L.Ed.2d 339 (1976), the Court added, in another per curiam, that excluding even <em>one </em>venireman on grounds at variance with the <em>Witherspoon </em>standard was fatal, and this although the state may have gone to trial with one peremptory challenge unexercised.</p>\n<p id=\"b1359-11\">Finally and most recently, the Court handed down its opinion in <em>Lockett v. Ohio, </em>438 U.S. 586, 98 S.Ct. 2954, 57 L.Ed.2d 973 (1978). Here the Court at last rejected a <em>Witherspoon </em>challenge, though it vacated the imposed death sentence on other grounds. Four veniremen had responded, in reply to prosecution questioning, that they were sufficiently opposed to capital punishment that they could not take the law and hear the evidence \u201c \u2018without con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1300\">*1300</page-number>sidering the fact that capital punishment\u2019 might be imposed.\u201d Under further questioning by the trial judge, each twice stated specifically that, because of the strength of his convictions, he could not swear to well and truly try the case and follow the law knowing that the court might impose a death sentence if guilt were found. Citing language from <em>Witherspoon </em>and <em>Bouiden, </em>the Court held that jurors who could not be trusted to abide by the law as given them by the trial judge were properly excluded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-4\">It is true that this \u201cuntrustworthiness\u201d took the more honorable form of being unwilling to take the oath to follow instructions. Aside from this moral distinction, however, we would see no difference between one who refuses to be sworn in such a case because of his convictions and one who avows that he will take an oath to be indifferent to the penalty but will feel free, because of the strength of his convictions, to disregard it. Certainly, one who so avows holds strong views indeed and not mere general reservations or reluctance about capital punishment. His position may be slightly' less extreme than one who is resolved to vote against the death penalty automatically and regardless of the evidence, but he clearly indicates that he will not serve unless he is legally and morally free to disregard his oath.</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-5\">And so our survey of ruling Supreme Court law in the area is complete. It may be summarized:</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-6\">1. Only the most extreme and compelling prejudice against the death penalty, perhaps only or very nearly a resolve to vote against it blindly and in all circumstances, is cause to exclude a juror on <em>Witherspoon </em>grounds. A mere disbelief in it, or even \u201cconscientious or religious scruples against its infliction\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> will not suffice, since many people hold such views and some of these may yet be able to overcome them and abide by the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-7\">2. No jury from which even one person has been excused on broader <em>Wither-spoon </em>-type grounds than these may impose a death penalty or sit in a case where it may be imposed, regardless of whether an available peremptory challenge might have reached him. Bearing these in mind, we turn to the jury in Burns\u2019 case.</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-9\">Section 12.31(b) of the Texas Penal Code provides that no person is qualified to serve as a juror \u201cunless he states under oath that the mandatory penalty of death or imprisonment for life will not affect his deliberations on any issue of fact.\u201d Tex.Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 12.31 (1974). The questioning of four veniremen on the Burns panel \u2014 Doss, Mann, Tillman, and Mitchell \u2014 reflects this provision; and each said at least once that the mandatory death penalty would affect his or her deliberations on issues of fact. Mrs. Doss testified that she did not believe in the death penalty; Mrs. Mann testified that she had thought about the death penalty a lot and was against it, and in no circumstances could she give it. Mr. Tillman acknowledged additionally that he could not sit and decide this case due to the existence of the penalty, that it would be \u201creal hard\u201d to sit and listen objectively to the issues, and that he could not do it. Mrs. Mitchell commenced by saying that she did not think the mandatory sentence would affect her deliberations on the facts, but she later said it probably would affect her decision or deliberations and finally stated that she was sure her deliberations on issues of fact would be affected. The pertinent portions of the sworn voir dire of these veniremen are set out in the Appendix.</p>\n<p id=\"b1360-10\">Defendant\u2019s counsel did not clearly object to the exclusion of each of these veniremen. Regarding Mrs. Doss and Mrs. Mitchell, he requested and was denied the right to question them further. For Mrs. Mitchell, he questioned the sense in which she had interpreted \u201caffect,\u201d whether she meant that she would consider the gravity of the penalty or meant instead that she could not consider death at all. He then excepted to the court\u2019s sustaining the state\u2019s challenge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1301\">*1301</page-number>for cause to Mrs. Mitchell. Regarding Mr. Tillman, he only noted an exception to the fact that the \u201c <em>Witherspoon </em>question\u201d was not asked. No comment was made regarding Mrs. Mann. The state used only 13 of its 15 peremptory challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-5\">We need go no further than to the examination of Mrs. Doss to see that at least one prospective juror was excused for holding views about capital punishment not shown to be sufficiently unbending to meet <em>Witherspoon </em>standards. Three times in succession she affirmed that she \u201cdid not believe in\u201d the death penalty. She then acknowledged that the mandatory penalty of death or life imprisonment would \u201caffect\u201d her \u201cdeliberations on any issue of fact in the case.\u201d This is all. Defense counsel immediately stated he thought she should be asked further questions, but the court excused her without more, observing, \u201cI don\u2019t know what you could ask.\u201d Unfortunately perhaps, we do.</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-6\">She could have been asked whether, despite her expressed convictions, she could put her disbelief aside and do her duty as a citizen. Her answer might have been that she could. Or she could have been asked <em>what </em>effect the presence of a possible death sentence would have on her deliberations. Her answer might have been that she would wish to be very sure of guilt, to be thoroughly convinced, before she could find facts in such a way that the death penalty might result. Either answer would doubtless have rehabilitated her for jury service. An answer that she would not take or could not comply with the required oath not to be \u201caffected\u201d in her deliberations would doubtless, upon a proper definition of \u201caffected\u201d as meaning \u201cdisablingly\u201d or \u201cinsurmountably\u201d affected, have clearly disqualified her. To be sure, these are mere speculations about what her answers to such questions might have been. The point is that nothing in her actual answers forecloses them. Her mere acknowledgment that the penalty would \u201caffect\u201d her deliberations does not do so: what candid and responsible citizen would not admit as much, could truthfully swear the proposition to be one of no concern whatever?</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-8\">True, the last question was phrased in the very terms of the oath that would be required of her as a juror, so that an iron literality might hold her properly disqualified under the Texas statute. But if so, then the statute is impermissibly broader than <em>Witherspoon </em>and its follow-ons. These clearly demand at the least that the effect be a profound, perhaps an insurmountable, one before the venireman can be disqualified. Even <em>Lockett, </em>the most recent and arguably the least stringent of <em>Witherspoon\u2019s </em>progeny, demands an effect to the degree of foreswearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-9\">This being true, the mere reply by Mrs. Doss that the potential penalty would \u201caffect\u201d her is insufficient to permit her disqualification. Such an ambiguous answer spans the range of possible effects on her from a mere heightening of the seriousness with which she might approach her deliberations as a juror, through conscientious and moral dilemmas foreseen, to an utter refusal to deliberate rationally at all. More than this was required for her disqualification, and more was denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-10\">Taken as a whole, Mr. Tillman\u2019s replies are almost as dubious. He, too, acknowledged that he \u201cthought\u201d and \u201cbelieved\u201d that his deliberations would be affected, that to be objective in the face of a potential death penalty \u201cwould be real hard to do,\u201d and finally that he could not be. But a fair reading of his responses leaves the mind unsatisfied what his response to the hard questions would have been had they been asked. They were not; all he did was admit he would be \u201caffected\u201d to some unknown degree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1361-11\">Finally, the state contends in passing that Burns\u2019 trial counsel failed to preserve any errors in excusing veniremen, thus waiving them under the rule of <em>Wainwright v. Sykes, </em>433 U.S. 72, 97 S.Ct. 2497, 53 L.Ed.2d 594 (1977). We are unable to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1302\">*1302</page-number>agree. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals must, in passing on Burns\u2019 direct appeal, have considered error properly preserved under state practice as to the excusing of Mrs. Doss, since it considered the matter on its merits and held that the failure to permit further questioning of her at counsel\u2019s request was in fact erroneous.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Further, counsel objected to the excusing of Mr. Tillman for failure of the prosecutor to ask \u201c \u2018the question required by the <em>Wither-spoon </em>case\u2019.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> More, much of the voir dire concerned the <em>Witherspoon </em>problem; the trial judge\u2019s comments and questions, many of which are set out in <em>Burns v. State, </em>556 S.W.2d 270 (Tex.Cr.App.1977), clearly indicate that his attention was focussed upon it during the entire process of cutting the panel. This being so, we think defense counsel\u2019s request as to Mrs. Doss, at least, was sufficient to avoid a waiver under state procedural rules. And as we noted above, the Texas court apparently thought so too, since it addressed her recusal on substantive grounds. We therefore need not grapple with the question whether counsel\u2019s actions, though imperfect for purposes of state procedure, might yet suffice to prevent a waiver for our purposes in a matter of such gravity. That Pandora\u2019s Box we leave to another day.</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-4\">We cannot close without voicing our dissatisfaction at the unfortunate result to which logic and our lights on <em>Witherspoon </em>have driven us. Indeed, it is with something like agony \u2014 though only a pale shadow of what must have been felt by the victim of Burns\u2019 ghastly crime \u2014 that we intervene to set aside in part the operation of state policy and procedures aimed at preventing further atrocities of this kind. Nor do we retreat an inch from our observation in <em>Spinkellink v. </em>Wainwright<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> that \u201cthe State also enjoys the right to an impartial jury . . . and impartiality requires not only freedom from jury bias against the accused and for the prosecution, but freedom from jury bias for the accused and against the prosecution.\u201d After all, the prosecution speaks in some degree for Burns\u2019 helpless and pitiful victim and to that degree justly claims in his right.</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-8\">But the requirements of <em>Witherspoon </em>are clear, and the Supreme Court has made equally clear in later decisions that it will not countenance their grudging or ungenerous application. We could not, even if we would, trench upon them here in any finally effective way. It well may be that, measured by some universal law or standard, the Texas statute is just and fair. But we must measure by <em>Witherspoon, </em>and by it Burns\u2019 death sentence cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-9\">We therefore REVERSE the judgment of the district court and REMAND the cause with instructions that the writ issue to the extent only that execution of petitioner\u2019s existing death sentence is forbidden and for such other proceedings as the court shall think fit. It is so ORDERED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-10\">REVERSED and REMANDED.</p>\n<p id=\"b1362-11\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"AT9g\">\n<em>Mrs. Billie L.

E. Pete McDonald while in the course of committing a robbery. Of course the death penalty is now in effect in cases such as this, capital offense, capital felony case and I would like to start off briefly by saying that this is a capital felony case as I have already said, and ask you, will the mandatory penalty of death or imprisonment for life affect your deliberations on any issue of fact in this case? In other words the fact that the punishment is mandatory life or death, would that affect your deliberations on any issue of fact?</p>\n<p id=\"b1363-23\">A.

Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b1363-26\">Q And you do not believe in the death penalty or believe that you can sit up there, that is your belief and we respect that but you cannot sit up there objectively and listen to the issues realizing that the outcome would be death?</p>\n<p id=\"b1363-27\">A It would be real hard to do.</p>\n<p id=\"b1363-28\">Q You are telling us that you could not do that?</p>\n<p id=\"b1363-29\">A Right.</p>\n<p id=\"b1363-30\">Q And of course I respect that belief and understand it, we have had other people say that and if it would affect your deliberations, which you have told us it would, we ask the court at this time to make sure again the fact that the mandatory death, mandatory penalty of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1304\">*1304</page-number>death or imprisonment for life will affect your deliberations on any issue of fact, and it will?'</p>\n<p id=\"b1364-4\">A Yes.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1364-5\">THE COURT: Thank you, sir, for coming down.

Citing current public opinion polls, it noted that less than half of our citizens then believed in the death penalty and that, between 1960 and 1966, the percentage had fallen from 51% to 42%. 391 U.S. 510, 520 n.16, 88 S.Ct. 1770, 20 L.Ed.2d 776. Thus, the Court reasoned, to exclude from the jury those merely \u201creluctant\u201d to pronounce it would be to constitute an unrepresentative body, one which the Court later permitted itself to characterize (over the protest of Justices Black, Harlan and White) as a \u201changing jury.\u201d 391 U.S. 510, 523, 88 S.Ct. 1770, 20 L.Ed.2d 776. And lest the point be lost on the reader, the Court cited and quoted with apparent approval Arthur Koestler\u2019s 1956 polemic against capital punishment. 391 U.S. 510, 520 n.17, 88 S.Ct. 1770, 20 L.Ed.2d 776.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1360-11\">. <em>Witherspoon v.

It did so, although it reached a conclusion at variance with ours on the merits of the error, concluded that it was harmless for various reasons with which we have stated our disagreement above, and observed in passing that counsel\u2019s only comment was that he thought she should be questioned further. <em>Burns v. State, </em>556 S.W.2d 270, 278 (Tex.Cr.App.1977). It is not lightly or with any satisfaction that we respectfully disagree with the conclusions of that able court on this point, as did Judges Roberts and Phillips in dissent. Central to that court\u2019s analysis of the propriety of excusing Mrs. Doss, however, is the notion that the Texas statute requiring a juror\u2019s excusing on a mere showing that in some unspecified degree the potential of a death sentence would \u201caffect\u201d his deliberations is a ground independent of <em>Witherspoon </em>standards. But <em>Witherspoon </em>footnote 21 seems to us unequivocal in denouncing such wider needles-eyes where the death penalty is concerned, and it is overriding law that we are oathbound to follow.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1362-14\">. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1362-15\">. 578 F.2d 582, 596 (5th Cir. 1978), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 99 S.Ct. 1548, 59 L.Ed.2d 796 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
