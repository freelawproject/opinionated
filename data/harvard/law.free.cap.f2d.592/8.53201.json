The matter was handled under the Commission\u2019s modified procedure.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Six shippers supported the application and four competing carriers opposed it.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b69-18\">Review Board No. 1 of the Commission initially denied Petroleum a carrier\u2019s application on the ground \u201cthat the evidence fails to establish a need for applicant\u2019s proposed service which cannot be met by existing carriers.\u201d This finding was reversed by Division 1 of the Commission which found that a certificate of public convenience and necessity was justified. The petitioners claim that the decision of the Commission is not supported by substantial evidence and was arbitrary and capricious and, therefore, violated the Administrative Procedure Act. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(A), (E).</p>\n<p id=\"b69-19\">Our role as a reviewing court is limited. \u201cThe Commission is the guardian of the public interest in determining whether certificates of convenience and necessity shall be granted.\u201d <em>United States v. Detroit Navigation Co., </em>326 U.S. 236, 241, 66 S.Ct. 75, 77, 90 L.Ed.2d 38 (1945). It has long been recognized that determination of public convenience and necessity lies within the judgment and discretion of the ICC. <em>ICC v. Parker, </em>326 U.S. 60, 65, 65 S.Ct. 1490, 89 L.Ed. 2051 (1945); <em>Hilt Truck Line, Inc. v. United States, </em>532 F.2d 1199, 1201 (8th Cir. 1976). Against this backdrop, we review the findings of the Commission to determine if they were based on substantial evidence and/or were arbitrary and capricious. Substantial evidence has, since <em>Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, </em>340 U.S. 474, 477, 71 S.Ct. 456, 459, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951), been defined as \u201cmore than a mere scintilla. It means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d For repetition of this same theme, see <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>(1971); <em>Illinois Central Railroad Co. </em>v. <em>Norfolk &amp; Western Railway Co., </em>385 U.S. 57, 69, 87 S.Ct. 255, 17 L.Ed.2d 162 (1966); <em>Consolo v. Federal Maritime Commission, </em>383 U.S. 607, 619-620, 86 S.Ct. 1018, 16 L.Ed.2d 131 (1966).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-3\">In <em>Bowman Transportation, Inc. v. Arkansas-Best Freight System, Inc., </em>419 U.S. 281, 285, 95 S.Ct. 438, 442, 42 L.Ed.2d 447 (1974), <em>reh\u2019g denied, </em>420 U.S. 956, 95 S.Ct. 1340, 43 L.Ed.2d 433 (1975), the Court, in applying the arbitrary and capricious standard, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-4\">Under the \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d standard the scope of review is a narrow one. A reviewing court must \u201cconsider whether the decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment . ... Although this inquiry into the facts is to be searching and careful, the ultimate standard of review is a narrow one. The court is not empowered to substitute its judgment for that of the agency.\u201d <em>Citizens to Preserve Overton Park v. Volpe, supra, </em>[401 U.S. 402, 91 S.Ct. 814, 28 L.Ed.2d 136] at 416, 91 S.Ct. at 824. The agency must articulate a \u201crational connection between the facts found and the choice made.\u201d <em>Burlington Truck Lines v. United States, </em>371 U.S. 156, 168 [83 S.Ct. 239, 9 L.Ed.2d 207] (1962). While we may not supply a reasoned basis for the agency\u2019s action that the agency itself has not given, <em>SEC v. Chenery Corp., </em>332 U.S. 194, 196 [67 S.Ct. 1578, 91 L.Ed. 1995] (1947), we will uphold a decision of less than ideal clarity if the agency\u2019s path may reasonably be discerned. <em>Colorado Interstate Gas Co. v. FPC, </em>324 U.S. 581, 595 [65 S.Ct. 829, 89 L.Ed. 1206] (1945).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">We first address the question of whether there was substantial evidence to support the Commission\u2019s action. The Commission carefully considered the affidavits of the five supporting shippers which were substantially similar. All of the shippers stated essentially as follows: that they used private carriage for their present needs, that they intended to expand and increase their business, that they were familiar with the operations and equipment of Petroleum, that they wanted to use Petroleum to meet their future needs because of its reliability, schedule flexibility, and excellent equipment and that they were not interested in using the services of any other carrier. The core of the Commission\u2019s decision is to be found in the following paragraph.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b70-8\">As noted, shippers for the most part have not utilized the existing service of protestants, and it cannot be said on this record that their existing service is inadequate. However, we note that inadequacy of existing service is not indispensable to a finding of need for the proposed service. <em>Nashua Motor Express, Inc. v. United States, </em>230 F.Supp. 646, 653 (D.N. H.1964). Furthermore, we cannot ignore the praise expressed by the supporting shippers for the service now provided by applicant within the limited scope of its existing authority. Expansion of a high quality service is certainly consistent with the public convenience and necessity. We do not believe that it would be appropriate to frustrate applicant\u2019s apparent willingness and ability to offer its good service to a larger market area. The beneficial effects of additional competition is also another factor to be considered, especially where the commodities sought to be transported are various petroleum products and related to the Nation\u2019s continuing energy concerns. Moreover, since most of the involved traffic has been transported in private carriage, we do not believe that protestants will be adversely affected by a grant of authority to an extent contrary to the public interest. We conclude that a grant will, however, enhance the effectiveness and usefulness of applicant\u2019s present service to the supporting shippers. On balance, we find that the beneficial effects resulting from a grant of the proposed service outweigh the harm, if any, to protestants.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b70-9\">Given the Commission\u2019s acknowledged primacy in deciding what determines public convenience and necessity, we find that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>there was substantial evidence to anchor the Commission\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">The claim of arbitrary and capricious action, in addition to a general buckshot attack, specifically alleges that the Commission ignored its past precedents as set forth in <em>Pan-American Bus Line Operation, 1 </em>MCC 190 (1936), and <em>Novak Contract Carrier Application, </em>103 MCC 555 (1967). In <em>Pan-American, </em>the Commission, in what has by now become a hackneyed litany for rebuffed applicants and thwarted protestants, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-6\">The question, in substance, is whether the new operation or service will serve a useful public purpose, responsive to a public demand or need; whether this purpose can and will be served as well by existing lines or carriers; and whether it can be served by applicant with the new operation or service proposed without endangering or impairing the operations of existing carriers contrary to the public interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 203. This language is a guideline, not a straitjacket. The important thing is the protection and promotion of the public interest, not that of the certificated carriers. <em>Hilt Truck Line, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>532 F.2d at 1203. In <em>Bowman Transportation, Inc. </em>v. <em>Arkansas-Best Freight System, supra, </em>419 U.S. at 298, 95 S.Ct. at 448, the Court made the pertinent observation. \u201cOur decisions have dispelled any notion that the Commission\u2019s primary obligation is the protection of firms holding existing certificates.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">Petitioners argue, in effect, that, since the Commission found that the existing service was not inadequate, the granting of the application amounts to a disavowal of the principles enunciated in <em>Pan-American. </em>This completely ignores the current case law. In <em>Hilt Truck Line, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States, supra, </em>532 F.2d at 1203, the court accurately reflected the present state of the law.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-13\">In making its determination, the Commission may take into account not only present needs but also future requirements of shippers, and the ability of existing carriers to supply such projected service will not preclude the Commission from granting authority to an applicant. <em>Interstate Commerce Commission v. Parker, supra, </em>326 U.S. at 70, 65 S.Ct. at 1495, 89 L.Ed. at 2061. <em>See United States v. Dixie Highway Express, Inc., </em>389 U.S. 409, 411, 88 S.Ct. 539, 540,19 L.Ed.2d 639, 641 (1967); <em>Schaffer Transportation Co. v. United States, </em>355 U.S. 83, 90-91, 78 S.Ct. 173, 177, 2 L.Ed.2d 117, 122 (1957).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-14\"><em>See also Union Mechling v. United States, </em>390 F.Supp. 391, 405 (W.D.Pa.1974); <em>Hudson Transit Lines, Inc. v. United States, </em>314 F.Supp. 197, 201-02 (D.N.J.1970).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-15\">In a future needs case such as this, the ICC\u2019s judgment is to be accorded great weight. As stated in <em>United States v. Detroit Navigation, supra, </em>326 U.S. at 241, 66 S.Ct. at 77:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b71-16\">Its function is not only to appraise the facts and to draw inferences from them but also to bring to bear upon the problem an expert judgment and to determine from its analysis of the total situation on which side of the controversy the public interest lies. Its doubt that the public interest will be adequately served if resumption of service is left to existing carriers is entitled to the same respect as its expert judgment on other complicated transportation problems.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b71-17\">While the Commission did not recite or refer explicitly to the holding in <em>Pan-American, </em>we think it requirements were met as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>viewed in the context of applicable case law and the Commission\u2019s statutory duty.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">In <em>Novak, supra, </em>103 MCC 555, 557, the Commission stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-5\">It will be seen that the shippers and consignees supporting an application for the transportation of property are asked to \u201cidentify clearly the commodities they ship or receive, the points to or from which their traffic moves, the volume of freight they would tender to applicant, the transportation services now used for moving their traffic, and any deficiencies in existing services.\u201d This is the minimum showing expected of any applicant seeking a grant of motor carrier authority.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">Petitioners claim that this is a binding requirement which the Commission totally ignored in this case. We do not agree. Each of the shippers stated the area of present operation and the area it hoped to include in its future expansion. The argument that the phrase petroleum products is much too broad seems like grasping at a last straw. The petitioners, the applicant, and the shippers all knew what products were to be transported. It would appear to us that a common sense reading of the shippers\u2019 affidavits shows that the <em>Novak </em>requirements were met. <em>Novak, </em>like <em>Pan-American, </em>must be viewed through the prism of current case law against the background setting that Congress has entrusted to the ICC the role of carrying out the nation\u2019s transportation policy. <em>Schaffer Transportation Co. v. United States, </em>355 U.S. 83, 87-88, 78 S.Ct. 173, 2 L.Ed.2d 117 (1957). While the <em>Novak </em>standard may not have been strictly followed, we cannot say that the approach taken by the Commission was arbitrary and capricious. The failure of an applicant to fulfill the specific <em>Novak </em>requirements does not, in and of itself, require a reversal of the Commission\u2019s ruling. <em>Alleghany Corp. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>554 F.2d 615, 620 (3d Cir. 1977). In a modified procedure case similar to this, a three-judge court observed that the <em>Novak </em>guidelines were not to be used as procedural hurdles in the decision making process of the Commission and ruled:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b72-10\">Even if the added competition from Moen Truck Line would cause the plaintiff in this action to lose revenues, this in itself would not be sufficient cause for the Commission to deny Moen\u2019s application. <em>Mitchell Bros. Truck Lines v. United States, </em>327 F.Supp. 796, 798 (D.Or.1971); <em>Alexandria Barcroft &amp; Washington Transit Co. v. United States, </em>103 F.Supp. 607, 609 (E.D.Va.1951); <em>Schaffer Transportation Co. v. United States, </em>355 U.S. 83, 91, 78 S.Ct. 173, 2 L.Ed.2d 117 (1957); <em>AB&amp;C Transportation Co. Inc. v. United States, </em>69 F.Supp. 166, 169 (D.Mass.1946).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b72-11\"><em>Twin City Freight, Inc. v. United States, </em>360 F.Supp. 709, 713-14 (D.Minn.1972). In the instant case, all the shippers stated that it was their intention to use the applicant to meet their future needs, so this is not a situation involving the loss of present revenues. There is no question here of diversion, but, even if there were, \u201c[N]o carrier is entitled to protection from competition in the continuance of a service that fails to meet a public need, nor, by the same token, should the public be deprived of a new and improved service because it may divert some traffic from other carriers.\u201d <em>Schaffer Transportation Co. v. United States, supra, </em>355 U.S. at 91, 78 S.Ct. at 178. This principle was reiterated in <em>United States v. Dixie Highway Express, Inc., </em>389 U.S. 409, 411-12, 88 S.Ct. 539, 19 L.Ed.2d 639 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-12\">We find that, the Commission\u2019s decision was based on substantial evidence and was not arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>There is one additional matter. By motion filed November 17, 1978, the Commission seeks a remand to correct an obvious error. It had decided to disregard the supporting evidence of a shipper (Sure Oil and Chemical Corp.) because it was no longer in business, but its certificate inadvertently included operations from West Boylston, Massachusetts, to points in New Hampshire which had been supported solely by Sure Oil.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">\n<em>The motion for remand is granted, the decision of the Commission in all other respects is affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b69-20\">.

A reading of that case reveals that the ICC was upheld, not reversed as petitioners mistakenly assert. The quotation cited in the brief was limited to the findings of the ALJ which the Commission reversed because of lack of substantial evidence, which reversal was upheld by the court.
