The First Trust Company of St. Paul held the Government\u2019s mortgage on this property as trustee.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">The developer successfully issued its debentures, but, due to litigation over the adequacy of the environmental impact statement prepared by the Government, the project soon stalled. <em>See Cedar-Riverside Environmental Defense Fund v. Hills, </em>560 F.2d 377 (8th Cir. 1977). In June 1975, with work on the project still blocked by the environmental litigation, the developer stopped making debenture interest payments. This forced the Government to hon- or its guarantee for such payments, and the Government paid more than $5,000,000 in interest to the debenture holders by the end of 1977.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">Finally, on November 29,1977, in the face of the developer\u2019s extended default, and after lengthy negotiations had failed to produce a settlement, the United States instructed the trustee to declare the principal of all the debentures due and payable immediately pursuant to the terms of the mortgage agreement. To pay off the debenture holders, the United States deposited $24,000,000, plus interest, with the trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-12\">Thereafter, the United States and the trustee brought the present foreclosure action and moved for the appointment of a receiver. Appellees claimed a contractual right to the appointment of a receiver.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Appellees also alleged that the developer\u2019s debt of more than $30,000,000 exceeded the value of the mortgaged property, and that the developer\u2019s failure to pay real estate taxes and maintain the property in good condition had impaired the Government\u2019s security. In addition, they submitted an affidavit from an accountant who, after comparing the management costs of the mortgaged properties with and without a receiver, concluded that the use of a receiver would save $2,400 per month.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-13\">After a hearing on the appellees\u2019 motion, the district court ruled on June 13, 1978 that it was \u201crequired, under the present circumstances, to appoint a receiver pursuant to the Indenture and Title 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4527.\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court appointed a receiver, effective July 1, 1978, to operate, manage, and collect rents from the mortgaged properties during the pendency of the foreclosure. From that order, appellants took the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>Appellants\u2019 principal contention is that the United States failed to make an adequate showing of the need for a receiver. We disagree. After a thorough review of the record, we find the district court\u2019s order justified not only by appellants\u2019 contractual agreement that a receiver could be appointed in the event of default, but also by equitable considerations.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">Appellants also contend that the district court\u2019s order appointing a receiver should be vacated because it lacks specific findings of fact. We reject that contention in the circumstances of this case. Fed.R. Civ.P. 52(a) requires findings of fact only in non jury trials and in orders granting or refusing interlocutory injunctions. Rule 52(a) specifically provides that \u201c[fjindings of fact and conclusions of law are unnecessary on decisions of motions under Rules 12 or 56 or any other motion except [a motion to dismiss at the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case in a nonjury trial].\u201d Therefore, the district court did not err in failing to make findings of fact in its order appointing the receiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">Although the failure of the trial court to make specific findings does not constitute error, the absence of detailed findings in a case such as this one makes our review task much more difficult. We suggest, therefore, that district court judges in the future furnish a statement of reasons or findings underlying appealable interlocutory orders when it is practical to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">We affirm the order of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b530-15\">.

Such governmental assistance was authorized by Title VII of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1970, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4501-4532 (1976).
