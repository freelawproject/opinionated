The District Court dismissed the complaint on the ground that plaintiffs had failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-10\">Plaintiffs are shareholders of the O\u2019Hare Chicago Corporation, which owns and operates the Ramada O\u2019Hare Inn in Rosemont, Illinois. Sometime in 1969 defendant Anthony Karlos mailed letters to the shareholders of O\u2019Hare Chicago, asking them to participate in the voting trust. Plaintiffs delivered their O\u2019Hare Chicago stock to the defendant LaSalle National Bank, trustee for the voting trust, on December 19, 1969. They allege that at no time prior to February 14, 1971 were they informed that participation in the voting trust required that they relinquish their voting rights in the corporation for 10 years. On that date they attended O\u2019Hare Chicago\u2019s annual shareholders meeting and were informed that because of the voting trust agreement they could not vote for board of directors candidates at that meeting or vote on any other issues for 10 years. Nevertheless, plaintiffs did not file the complaint in this case until December 20, 1977, more than six years after they discovered the alleged material omission.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-14\">Plaintiffs rely on \u00a7 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933,15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77q(a)(2), \u00a7 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j(b), and the Security and Exchange Commission\u2019s Rule 10b-5, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.10b-5(b). The District Court held that all of plaintiffs\u2019 federal law claims were time barred.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b413-15\">Relying upon <em>Hupp v. Gray, </em>500 F.2d 993, 996 (7th Cir. 1974), the District Court found that because there was no federal statute of limitations for actions based on \u00a7 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act, \u00a7 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act, or Rule 10b-5, Illinois\u2019 three year statute of limitations for similar actions was applicable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b414-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>Distinctions between legal and equitable remedies are not often necessary in the federal courts, where law and equity are merged under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. For the purpose of determining whether laches or a statute of limitations is applicable to a claim based on a federal right, however, that distinction is controlling.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In the federal courts the statute of limitations yields to the doctrine of laches only in cases in which equitable jurisdiction is \u201cexclusive\u201d and not \u201cconcurrent.\u201d <em>See generally 2 Moore\u2019s Federal Practice </em>13.07[3], 3-67 to 3-71, 3-74 to 3-76 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">Appellants contend that, because they seek only equitable relief that would not be obtainable in an action at law, there is no \u201cconcurrent\u201d remedy at law, and therefore the statute of limitations is inapplicable. The inquiry is not whether a plaintiff could obtain the same relief at law; rather, it is whether the statute relied on requires the plaintiff to seek relief only in equity. Compare <em>Cope v. Anderson, </em>331 U.S. 461, 463-464, 67 S.Ct. 1340, 91 L.Ed. 1602 (1947) with <em>Holmberg v. Armbrecht, </em>327 U.S. 392, 395-396, 66 S.Ct. 582, 90 L.Ed. 743 (1946) and <em>Russell v. Todd, </em>309 U.S. 280, 285-286, 60 S.Ct. 527, 84 L.Ed. 754 (1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">In the <em>Russell </em>and <em>Holmberg </em>cases, the sole remedy was in equity, and therefore laches rather than the statute of limitations applied. Both were actions to enforce the liability of shareholders of insolvent joint stock banks under \u00a7 16 of the Federal Farm Loan Act, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 812 (1940). Since the Farm Loan Act imposed liability on each shareholder for his \u201cequal and ratable\u201d share of the bank\u2019s debts in excess of its assets,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b414-6\">the sole remedy is by plenary representative suit brought in equity in behalf of all creditors of the bank, in which the existence and extent of insolvency, and the ratable shares of the contribution by shareholders can be ascertained and an equitable distribution made of the funds recovered. But this amount cannot be determined and its distribution effected without resort to the procedures traditionally employed by equity upon a bill for an accounting and for the distribution of a fund brought into its custody. No stockholder is liable for more than his proportion of the debts not exceeding the par value of his stock. His proportion can be ascertained only upon an accounting of the debts and of the stock and a pro rata distribution of the liability among the shareholders and of the proceeds of recovery among the creditors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AeE\"><em>Russell v. Todd, supra, </em>at 285, 60 S.Ct. at 530. The Court distinguished actions based on the analogous provision in the National Bank Act, 12 U.S.C. \u00a7 63 (1940), on the ground that the Bank Act authorized the Comptroller of the Currency to assess a specific amount against each shareholder of an insolvent national bank to satisfy the claims of its creditors. Each shareholder was, therefore, liable in a suit at law for the amount assessed.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-11\">Section 12 of the Farm Loan Act defined each shareholder\u2019s liability by reference to the total amount of the creditors\u2019 claims and the total number of shareholders. <em>See Christopher v. Brusselback, </em>302 U.S. 500, 502-503, 58 S.Ct. 350, 82 L.Ed. 388 (1938). Since the amount of claims actually asserted might differ from the potential amount of creditors\u2019 claims, no shareholder was liable to any single creditor for any amount until the total amount was fixed. <em>See Brusselback v. Cago Corporation, </em>85 F.2d 20, 22 (2d Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>299 U.S. 586, 57 S.Ct. 111, 81 L.Ed. 432 (1936). All the creditors had to be brought together in a single lawsuit. <em>Id. </em>Traditionally, a class action could only be filed on the equity side of the court. <em>Id. </em>Therefore, the statute created a \u201cfederal right for which the sole remedy is in equity.\u201d <em>Holmberg v. Armbrecht, supra, </em>327 U.S. at 395, 66 S.Ct. at 584; <em>see Todd v. Russell, </em>104 F.2d 169, 172 (2d Cir. 1937), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>309 U.S. 280, 60 S.Ct. 527, 84 L.Ed. 754 (1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>If, however, the sole remedy is not in equity and an action at law can be brought on the same facts, the remedies are concurrent for purposes of the rule under consideration even though more effective relief would be available in equity. In <em>Cope v. Anderson, supra, </em>two plaintiffs attempted to recover from the shareholders of two different national banks under \u00a7 63 of the National Bank Act. The banks\u2019 creditors filed class actions against all the shareholders of the two banks. The applicable statutes of limitations had expired by the time both suits were filed, but plaintiffs argued that since the suits had been filed in equity, the doctrine of laches, and not any statutes of limitations, was applicable. Justice Black, writing for the Court, rejected the argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b415-5\">Even though these suits are in equity, the states\u2019 statutes of limitations apply. For it is the scope of the relief sought and the multitude of parties sued which gives equity concurrent jurisdiction to enforce the legal obligation here asserted. And equity will withhold its relief in such a case where the applicable statute of limitations would bar the concurrent legal remedy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b415-6\"><em>Id. </em>331 U.S. at 463-464, 67 S.Ct. at 1341. It is apparent that individual actions against each shareholder by each creditor would have been impractical as well as costly. Nevertheless, since the plaintiffs could have sought relief at law, the statute of limitations applied.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">Equitable jurisdiction is concurrent even though plaintiff chooses to forego damages and to seek only equitable relief. <em>Madison v. Wood, </em>410 F.2d 564, 567-568 (6th Cir. 1969); <em>Swan v. Board of Higher Education of the City of New York, </em>319 F.2d 56, 59-60 n.5 (2d Cir. 1963); <em>see also Williams v. Walsh, </em>558 F.2d 667, 671 (2d Cir. 1977). Therefore, if an action at law for damages would be barred, so too is the action in equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-12\">In the case at bar, if the facts alleged established a violation of \u00a7 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and Rule lob-5, plaintiffs could maintain an action for damages. <em>See Superintendent of Insurance v. Bankers Life &amp; Casualty, </em>404 U.S. 6, 13 n.9, 92 S.Ct. 165, 30 L.Ed.2d 128 (1971). Equitable jurisdiction is therefore \u201cconcurrent\u201d and not \u201cexclusive.\u201d Illinois\u2019 three year statute of limitations is applicable to claims for damages under \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b\u20145. <em>Hupp v. Gray, </em>500 F.2d 993, 996 (7th Cir. 1974); <em>Parrent v. Midwest Rug Mills, </em>455 F.2d 123, 125-127 (7th Cir. 1972). Plaintiffs\u2019 claim for equitable relief based on \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 is barred since a claim at law for damages would be barred. <em>See Madison v. Wood, supra; Swan v. Board of Higher Education, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b415-13\">Plaintiffs\u2019 claim under \u00a7 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 is in a similar posture. If a private right of action under that section exists even though the \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 claim is barred,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> equitable jurisdiction would be \u201cconcurrent.\u201d Illinois\u2019 three year statute of limitations is applicable to a claim for damages under \u00a7 17(a), <em>Parrent v. Midwest Rug, supra, </em>and therefore plaintiffs\u2019 claim for equitable relief based on that section is barred. <em>See Madison v. Wood, supra; Swan v. Board of Higher Education, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b415-14\">Furthermore, it should be noted that \u00a7 12 of the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77l,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> creates a cause of action for dam<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>ages in language virtually identical to that in \u00a7 17(a)(2). Plaintiffs do not rely on \u00a7 12 because the statute of limitations for any such action expired more than five years before the complaint in this case was filed. See 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 77m. Nevertheless, the existence of \u00a7 12 makes it difficult to say that appellants\u2019 \u201csole remedy\u201d is in equity.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">Plaintiffs, presumably, referring to the LaSalle National Bank\u2019s status as trustee of the voting trust, also rely on cases holding that statutes of limitations do not begin to run on claims for misappropriation or mishandling of trust assets until the trust terminates. <em>Lewis v. Hawkins, </em>90 U.S. (23 Wall.) 119, 23 L.Ed. 113 (1875); <em>Woodruff v. City of Chicago, </em>394 Ill. 542, 551, 69 N.E.2d 287 (1946); <em>Manufacturers Trust v. Kelby, </em>125 F.2d 650, 654 (2d Cir. 1942). The result<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> in the first case and the holdings in the others follow from the principle that a trustee\u2019s duty to account for trust property continues so long as the trust continues. They have no application here, where the claim is based upon alleged omissions in statements which were made by persons other than the trustee and which have nothing to do with the trustee\u2019s duty to account.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court, dismissing the complaint, is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b413-11\">. Plaintiffs asserted certain state law claims that also were dismissed. Since the federal law claims had been disposed of at the outset of the case, the court properly dismissed the pendent state law claims. <em>See United Mine Workers v. Gibbs, </em>383 U.S. 715, 725-726, 86 S.Ct. 1130, 16 L.Ed.2d 218 (1966); <em>Hupp v. Gray, 500 </em>F.2d 993, 997-998 (7th Cir. 1974). Those claims are now the subject of state court proceedings, <em>Lane v. O\u2019Hare Chicago Corporation </em>(78-CH-203), and are not before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b413-12\">. The District Court also held that the temporary exchange of stock for voting trust certificates did not constitute a \u201cpurchase or sale\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 10(b) or Rule 10b-5. It can be argued that \u00a7 17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 does not contain a \u201cpurchase or sale\u201d requirement. The District Court did not address the \u00a7 17 claim at the first hearing. But at a second hearing on the defendants\u2019 \u201cmotion to dismiss\u201d the amended complaint, the District Court held that the \u00a7 17 claim was barred by the statute of limitations and, in the alternative, that plaintiffs had failed to allege \u201cscienter,\u201d and therefore had failed to state a claim for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-17\">At the first hearing the District Court granted plaintiffs leave to file an amended complaint; at the second hearing, however, in ruling on defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss the amended complaint the court denied leave to file an amended complaint. We treat the court\u2019s two rulings as simply granting defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss. Since we agree that any federal securities law claim that plaintiffs might have had is barred by the statute of limitations, we do not reach the issues of whether the transaction involved here constitutes a \u201cpurchase or sale\u201d for purposes of \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 or whether there is an implied cause of action under \u00a7 17, absent a viable claim based on \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5. <em>See Daniel v. International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of America, </em>561 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>F.2d 1223, 1244-1246 (7th Cir. 1977), <em>rev\u2019d on other </em>grounds,-U.S. -, 99 S.Ct. 790, 58 L.Ed.2d 808 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b414-12\">. In diversity cases, the state time limitation is controlling. <em>Guaranty Trust Company v. York, </em>326 U.S. 99, 110, 65 S.Ct. 1464, 89 L.Ed. 2079 (1945).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b415-8\">. This court has held that a private right of action for damages under \u00a7 17(a) can be maintained if a claim under \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 is established. See <em>Daniel v. International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen and Helpers of America, </em>561 F.2d 1223, 1244-1246 (7th Cir. 1977), <em>rev\u2019d on other grounds, </em>- U.S. -, 99 S.Ct. 790, 58 L.Ed.2d 808 (1979); <em>Schaefer v. First National Bank of Lincolnwood, </em>509 F.2d 1287, 1293 (7th Cir. 1975). If the \u00a7 17(a) claim is dependent on the existence of a \u00a7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 claim and the latter is barred by the statute of limitations, the \u00a7 17(a) claim would also seem to be barred.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b415-16\">.

Similarly, although some of the individual defendants are directors of O\u2019Hare Chicago, with fiduciary duties to the shareholders of that corporation, those duties are not involved here, where the claim is based on alleged omissions in statements made to induce participation in a voting trust, and therefore plaintiffs\u2019 reliance on <em>Lewis v.
