He was sentenced to pay a $250 fine on each of the two offenses. He was also sentenced to serve five days of a six months suspended sentence and to perform volunteer work four hours a week for one year. We affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-17\">Regarding the substantive gambling offense, defendant argues that the evidence is not sufficient to establish his role as one who \u201cconducts ... all or part of an illegal gambling business.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1955(a). Rowland\u2019s own admissions and other evidence provide a factual basis for the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that Rowland made his apartment available to associates knowing that they were conducting gambling activities on the premises and using Rowland\u2019s telephone for this purpose. On several occasions, Rowland took bets over his telephone and relayed the information to his bookmaker associates. This degree of participation is sufficient to establish Rowland\u2019s guilt under the statute. <em>United States v. Leon, </em>534 F.2d 667 (6th Cir. 1976); <em>United States v. Fino, </em>478 F.2d 35, 38 (2d Cir. 1973), <em>cert. denied </em>417 U.S. 918, 94 S.Ct. 2623, 41 L.Ed.2d 223 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-18\">Defendant also contends that, because the proof does not show that he had a \u201cfinancial interest\u201d in the gambling enterprise or profited from it, he is not criminally liable under \u00a7 1955. The argument runs counter to the overwhelming weight of authority that anyone who participates in a gambling business \u2014 other than a mere bettor \u2014 is subject to criminal liability under \u00a7 1955. <em>See e. g., Sanabria v. United States, </em>437 U.S. 54, 98 S.Ct. 2170, 2182 n.26, 57 L.Ed.2d 43 (1978); <em>United States v. Bennett, </em>563 F.2d 879, 880-81 (8th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>434 U.S. 924, 98 S.Ct. 403, 54 L.Ed.2d 282 (1977), <em>citing, inter alia, United States v. Leon, </em>534 F.2d 667 (6th Cir. 1976). Dicta in <em>United States v. Tartar, </em>522 F.2d 520, 526 (6th Cir. 1975) that a defendant must be shown to have a specific \u201cfinancial interest\u201d in the gambling operation appears inconsistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in the <em>Sanabria </em>case, <em>supra. See also United States v. Becker, </em>461 F.2d 230, 232-33 (2d Cir. 1972), <em>vacated on other grounds, </em>417 U.S. 903, 94 S.Ct. 2597, 41 L.Ed.2d 208 (1974); <em>United States v. Joseph, </em>519 F.2d 1068, 1071 (5th Cir. 1975), <em>cert. denied, </em>424 U.S. 909, 96 S.Ct. 1103, 47 L.Ed.2d 312 (1976). The government need not prove as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>an element of the crime that the defendant received or intended to receive a salary, commission or other monetary payment or profit from the venture. The pleasure of participation and association in a gambling enterprise which otherwise meets the statutory test is sufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Rowland\u2019s challenge to his conspiracy conviction is premised entirely on his claim that he was not guilty of the substantive offense under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1955. The premise is flawed, and the argument therefore fails. The Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Iannelli v. United States, </em>420 U.S. 770, 95 S.Ct. 1284, 43 L.Ed.2d 616 (1975) (Mr. Justices Douglas, Brennan, Stewart and Marshall dissenting), holds squarely that the substantive offense under \u00a7 1955 is separate from a conspiracy to commit the offense and may be separately punished. In order to be guilty of the conspiracy offense, a defendant need not have intended to receive a monetary profit so long as he had knowledge of the object of the conspiracy and intended to agree to participate in bringing the object about. <em>See Developments in the Law of Criminal Conspiracy, </em>72 Harv.L.Rev. 921, 930-33 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Accordingly, it is ORDERED that the judgment of conviction be and hereby is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
