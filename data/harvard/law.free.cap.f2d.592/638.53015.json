Haight, Jr., <em>District Judge, </em>[1977-1978 Transfer Binder] CCH Fed.Sec.L.Rep. 196,074 (S.D.N.Y., June 2, 1977), which dismissed and struck substantial portions of a securities fraud indictment because of alleged misconduct by SEC employees in attempting to settle a <em>civil </em>action brought by the SEC against defendants who later were named as defendants in the criminal action, the chief question is whether the district court abused its discretion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We hold that it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-20\">We affirm in part, and reverse and remand in part, with directions to reinstate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>the unexpurgated indictment and to proceed with the case in the district court according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">The indictment which is the subject of the instant appeal was returned November 8, 1976. It named as defendants, all of whom are appellants herein, Douglas P. Fields, Frederick M. Friedman, Peter S. Davis, Alan E. Sandberg, and Eric Berge. The specific offenses charged against the respective defendants are summarized in the margin.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">To the extent necessary to an understanding of our rulings on the legal issues presented, we summarize here the essential facts and fraudulent transactions charged in the indictment.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> They occurred during the two year period from March 1971 to March 1973. They involved two publicly held corporations, TDA Industries, Inc. (TDA) and its subsidiary, Westcalind Corp. (Westcalind). Defendants were officers and directors of the two corporations, except that Davis, an attorney, was general counsel to TDA.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">(A) <em>Westcalind Kickback</em></p>\n<p id=\"b701-9\">In March 1971, while Fields and Friedman were officers and directors of TDA, they caused Westcalind to pay a $50,000 \u201cfinder\u2019s fee\u201d to a third party for services never performed. The \u201cfinder\u201d retained $15,000 and kicked back the $35,000 balance to Fields and Friedman.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-11\">(B) <em>ERD Kickbacks</em></p>\n<p id=\"b701-12\">In April and May 1971, Friedman and Davis refused requests by a group of TDA shareholders to \u201cfree-up\u201d their lettered stock for public sale. These defendants falsely represented to the stockholders that the stock in question could be transferred only by a private placement. They then arranged for a private placement of the stock to themselves at a $2 per share discount from the market price. As soon as they acquired the stock, and by a prearrangement not disclosed to the selling stockholders, they did \u201cfree-up\u201d the stock and sold it on the open market. Seventy percent of the gross profit was kicked back to these defendants, resulting in a profit to them in excess of $300,000. This transaction defrauded the selling TDA stockholders of $435,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-13\">(C) <em>Manipulation of Price of TDA Stock</em></p>\n<p id=\"b701-14\">In November 1971, Fields paid certain co-conspirators to buy TDA stock on the open market immediately prior to a public <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"642\">*642</page-number>secondary offering of the stock. This was intended artificially to inflate the offering price.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">(D) <em>Eagle Roofing Kickback</em></p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">In February and March 1973, Friedman and Sandberg, each of whom was an officer and director of TDA, caused TDA to pay another sham \u201cfinder\u2019s fee\u201d, this time in amount of $100,000, to another third party for services never performed. The \u201cfinder\u201d retained $18,000 and kicked back the $82,-000 balance to Friedman and Sandberg.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">(E) <em>Other Offenses Charged</em></p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">In addition to the four transactions referred to above, the indictment charges the following other offenses:</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">Fields, Friedman and Davis prepared and filed an offering prospectus for TDA stock which failed to disclose the Westcalind kickback, the ERD kickbacks and the TDA price manipulation. They also solicited proxies from TDA stockholders without disclosing these matters in the proxy statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-9\">Fields, Friedman, Davis and Berge (the latter an officer and director of Westcalind) solicited proxies from Westcalind shareholders without disclosure of the Westcalind kickback, the ERD kickbacks and the TDA price manipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-10\">Friedman and Sandberg violated the wire fraud and mail fraud statutes in connection with the Eagle Roofing kickback.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-11\">Berge gave false testimony under oath before the SEC about the Westcalind kickback.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-12\">Reiterating what we have said above, note 4 <em>supra, </em>the foregoing summary is of offenses <em>charged </em>in the indictment, not a summary of crimes proven. Nevertheless, for the purpose of evaluating the action of the district court in dismissing and striking substantial portions of the indictment and to understand our rulings on the legal issues presented, suffice it to say that the indictment charges each of the defendants with very serious offenses which, if proven, constituted a clear fraud on public investors.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-16\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-17\">We focus next on the sequence of events during 1974 and 1975 \u2014 chiefly, certain negotiations between counsel for defendants and employees of the SEC\u2019s New York regional office \u2014 upon which the district court based its order dismissing and striking substantial portions of the indictment.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-18\">Backing up for a moment, during 1974 and early 1975, the office of the District Attorney for New York County conducted an investigation of the Westcalind, ERD and Eagle Roofing kickbacks referred to above. The targets of this investigation were Fields, Friedman and Davis (represented by attorneys Milton S. Gould, Esq. and Saul S. Streit, Esq.) and TDA (represented by attorney Herbert C. Kantor, Esq.).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-19\">On January 9, 1975, Gould and Streit were informed by Assistant District Attorney Driscoll that his office had concluded that the three kickback transactions were not offenses cognizable under New York law. On the following day, January 10, anticipating that the District Attorney\u2019s office would refer the matter to the SEC\u2019s New York regional office, Gould telephoned William Moran, Esq., the SEC\u2019s New York regional administrator, and made an appointment to see him on January 14. Before telephoning Moran, Gould had advised Fields, Friedman and Davis that it would be preferable to take the initiative and bring <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>the matter to the attention of the SEC before the District Attorney\u2019s office did. His clients agreed and authorized Gould to make the necessary disclosures to the SEC. Kantor received similar authority from the TDA board.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">On January 14, Gould (representing Fields, Friedman and Davis) and Kantor (representing TDA) met in the SEC\u2019s New York regional office with Moran and members of his staff, including Jeffrey Tucker, Esq., a branch chief, and Stuart Perlmutter, Esq., a staff attorney. At this meeting Gould and Kantor disclosed to the SEC employees the three kickback transactions which had been under investigation by the District Attorney\u2019s office. They did not disclose to the SEC then, or at any other time, the scheme to manipulate the price of TDA stock referred to above. The upshot of the January 14 meeting was that Gould proposed negotiations looking toward a possible civil settlement of the transactions disclosed, on the assumption that the SEC\u2019s investigation would not turn up something new. Moran said that he first would have to obtain authorization from the SEC\u2019s Division of Enforcement for a formal investigation of the alleged <em>civil </em>violations. Such authorization was granted on February 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">The chief purpose of the disclosures which defendants\u2019 counsel made at the January 14 meeting was to avoid a criminal reference to the Department of Justice.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Defendants\u2019 counsel, being thoroughly experienced in SEC procedure and in criminal matters, recognized from the outset that defendants\u2019 activities constituted criminal offenses under the federal securities laws. Their best hope, so they urged, was to work out some sort of a package by which defendants would accept the imposition of civil sanctions in return for the avoidance of a criminal reference. Defendants\u2019 experienced counsel of course also were aware of the SEC\u2019s long standing and well known policy <em>against </em>settling civil actions in a manner that would impair subsequent criminal prosecutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-12\">As the result of the SEC\u2019s investigation which had been authorized on February 19 and after a number of conversations between defendants\u2019 counsel and the SEC employees regarding a possible civil settlement, the SEC commenced a civil action on September 16,1975 in the Southern District of New York, entitled <em>SEC v. TDA Industries, Inc., et al., </em>75 Civ. 4519-LWP. The complaint named as defendants TDA, Westcalind and the five individual defendants later charged in the instant indictment. The complaint was based on the three kickback transactions which Gould and Kantor disclosed to the SEC at the January 14 meeting. The complaint sought injunctive and other relief, including an order that defendants disgorge the fraudulently obtained \u201cfinder\u2019s fees\u201d and the appointment of receivers for the two corporate defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-13\">During settlement negotiations between defendants\u2019 counsel and the SEC employees, both before and after the commencement of the SEC civil action on September 16,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> defendants\u2019 counsel repeatedly stated their desire to avoid a criminal reference if a consent judgment could be worked out in the civil proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-14\">Throughout these negotiations Tucker and Perlmutter of the SEC were aware of the stated objective of defense counsel to avoid a criminal reference if a consent judgment could be agreed upon. Tucker and Perlmutter remained silent during this period in response to the statements of defense counsel as to their objective. Such silence was interpreted by defense counsel as assent by Tucker and Perlmutter to defense counsel\u2019s proposal to avoid a criminal reference. Nevertheless, as we state below, Tucker and Perlmutter were in touch with the United States Attorney\u2019s office as early <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"644\">*644</page-number>as September 16 on the subject of a prospective criminal reference of the TDA matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-4\">As for the negotiations to settle the civil action, on December 1 a settlement offer was made by Gould and Streit to Tucker and Perlmutter, both of whom viewed the offer favorably. They recommended to their superiors that it be accepted. It was. Consents to the entry of judgment in the civil action were signed by Fields, Friedman and Davis on December 10 and 11, and judgments in the action as to them were entered on February 5, 1976. Similar consents were signed by Sandberg and Berge on January 6 and February 10, and judgments as to them were entered on January 16 and February 23. None of the defendants or their counsel knew, when the consents to the entry of judgment in the civil action were signed, that Tucker had communicated with the United States Attorney\u2019s office concerning the TDA matter on December 1, as stated below.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">As indicated above, Tucker and Perlmutter, beginning in September 1975, had been in touch with the United States Attorney\u2019s office about a criminal reference of the TDA matter. These contacts with Assistant United States Attorney Sorkin<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> continued during October and November. During this period Tucker and Perlmutter urged the United States Attorney\u2019s office to investigate the TDA matter but they made it clear that they wanted to conclude a settlement in the civil action before making a criminal reference.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">On December 1, shortly after Gould and Streit had made the offer to settle the civil action, Tucker, in the presence of the Assistant Regional Administrator of the SEC\u2019s New York Regional Office, communicated regarding the TDA matter with Assistant United States Attorney Wing, Chief of the Fraud Unit of the United States Attorney\u2019s office. This was done by telephone, followed by a letter dated December 1 from Tucker to Wing enclosing the SEC\u2019s pleadings file in the TDA case.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-11\">There followed an investigation of the TDA matter by the United States Attorney\u2019s office, presentation of the case to a grand jury, and the return of the instant indictment on November 8, 1976.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-13\">Before getting to the chief issue on this appeal as stated above, we shall take up as a preliminary matter the claim asserted by some of the appellees, namely, that the communications regarding this case by the Commission\u2019s staff to the United States Attorney\u2019s office on December 1, 1975 were contrary to the applicable statutes, rules and regulations. This ground for dismissal of the indictment<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> was urged upon the district court, as it is upon us. The district court rejected it. We also reject it.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-14\">The claim in essence is that the statutes authorize only the \u201cCommission\u201d to transmit evidence to the Attorney General for criminal proceedings, and that therefore the informal criminal reference on December 1, 1975 by the SEC\u2019s New York regional office to the United States Attorney\u2019s office \u201cconstituted an invalid criminal reference requiring dismissal of the resulting indictment.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We hold that this claim is totally without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-15\">It is important to bear in mind the distinctions, under SEC procedure, between preliminary communications between the Commission\u2019s staff and the United States Attorney\u2019s office, which may occur in the context of either a formal or informal in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"645\">*645</page-number>vestigation, and Commission criminal references, which may in turn be either formal or informal.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">With respect to the investigation procedure, the <em>informal, </em>or <em>preliminary, investigation </em>does not require members of the staff to obtain Commission authorization before turning over public or nonpublic investigative materials to the United States Attorney\u2019s office. On the other hand, a <em>formal investigation </em>of alleged criminal violations, where issuance of process or compulsion of testimony is necessary, does require Commission authorization. A formal investigation may or may not be preceded by an informal or preliminary one. 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 202.5(a) (1977).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-12\">As for the criminal reference procedure, whether formal or informal, it is authorized by statute and by Commission rules and regulations. In view of the fraudulent transactions charged in the instant indictment, we look to the Securities Act of 1933<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> each of which provides the statutory authorization for the Commission to transmit to the Attorney General available evidence of violations of the statutes involved for possible criminal proceedings.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Moreover, the Commission is authorized by statute to delegate \u201cany of its functions\u201d to an employee, among others.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In its Manual of Administrative Regulations, the Commission has delegated its authority to act to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"646\">*646</page-number>Directors of Divisions and Regional Administrators, and further has empowered these officials to redelegate such authority to designated members of their respective staffs.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The Commission\u2019s Manual specifically authorizes and <em>encourages </em>the disclosure of non public information to other federal law enforcement officials even when it has been developed in other than a formal investigation.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-4\">The district court below found that during recent years it has been the SEC policy in the Southern District of New York for the Regional Administrator to redelegate his authority to lower echelon attorneys for the purpose of conferring with the United States Attorney\u2019s office at an early stage of either a formal or informal investigation. We hold that the district court correctly declined to dismiss the indictment on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">As the SEC points out in its amicus brief, the procedure permitting preliminary eommunications with the United States Attorney has significant advantages. Allowing early participation in the case by the United States Attorney minimizes statute of limitations problems. The more time a United States Attorney has, the easier it is for him to become familiar with the complex facts of a securities fraud case, to prepare the case, and to present it to a grand jury before expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. Earlier initiation of criminal proceedings moreover is consistent with a defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial. We decline, as the district court likewise declined, to interfere with this commendable example of inter-agency cooperation.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b706-12\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-13\">This brings us to what we regard as the chief issue in the case \u2014 whether the district court in this <em>criminal </em>action abused its discretion in dismissing and striking substantial portions of the indictment<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> because of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>alleged misconduct by employees of the SEC in attempting to settle the <em>civil </em>action. On this issue we hold that the district court did abuse its discretion. We reverse and remand with directions to reinstate the unexpurgated indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">The district court recognized that, aside from <em>the most drastic remedy </em>of dismissing the indictment (as urged by all defendants), there were available at least two alternative remedies, i. e. \u201cadmonishment to the SEC\u201d and \u201c[permitting the defendants to reopen the consent judgments entered in the civil suit\u201d.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">We believe on the facts of this case that the district court, in opting for the most drastic remedy available to it, abused its discretion. The relief granted was wholly out of proportion to the wrong sought to be corrected. And it was contrary to the law of this circuit or any other circuit, so far as we are aware.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-7\">The extreme sanction of dismissal of an indictment is justified in order to achieve one or both of two objectives: first, to eliminate prejudice to a defendant in a criminal prosecution;<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> second, to \u201chelp to translate the assurances of the United States Attorneys into consistent performances by their assistants.\u201d <footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Here, dismissal of the indictment served neither objective.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-14\">We agree with the district court that the conduct of the SEC employees in concealing their reference of this case to the United States Attorney and in leading defense counsel to believe the opposite was improper. But we fail to see any resulting harm to defendants. By that time defendants, with their backs to the wall because of the New York County District Attorney\u2019s anticipated reference of the matter to the SEC, had long since disclosed enough facts to the SEC to enable the government to marshal the evidence and to proceed both civilly and criminally against them. Thus, even assuming arguendo that the SEC was en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>gaged in enforcement of federal <em>criminal </em>laws when it negotiated the <em>civil </em>consent decree \u2014 a proposition about which we have considerable doubt \u2014 it clearly was an abuse of discretion for the district court to employ such a severe sanction against the government on the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">Even when a <em>prosecutorial </em>arm of the government unlawfully obtains evidence, we normally limit the permissible sanction to suppression of the illegally obtained evidence. It is only in the rare case, where it is impossible to restore a criminal defendant to the position that he would have occupied vis-a-vis the prosecutor, that the indictment may be dismissed. <em>E. g., United States v. Jacobs, supra; United States </em>v. <em>Estepa, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">The improper conduct here certainly was not as egregious as that in <em>United States v. Rodman, </em>519 F.2d 1058 (1 Cir. 1975), where the SEC not only broke its promise but obtained incriminating evidence from the defendant in reliance on that promise. Moreover, the promise there was to \u201cstrongly recommend\u201d against prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-6\">As for the deterrence objective of the district court\u2019s order here, proper regard for the public interest in the prosecution of crimes counsels restraint in dismissing an indictment for deterrence purposes unless the course of official misconduct is a demonstrated, long-standing one. We have approved this extreme sanction only when the pattern of misconduct is widespread or continuous. <em>United States v. Jacobs, supra; United States v. Estepa, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b708-7\">What we have here is an isolated instance of misconduct by two employees of a large government agency. There is no contention that SEC employees generally fail to disclose to defense counsel the release of relevant information or a criminal reference to the Department of Justice. We know of no other instance where this has occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-8\">Since the district court\u2019s extreme sanction of dismissal of the indictment is not justified on grounds of eliminating prejudice to the defendants in this criminal prosecution or of deterring widespread or continuous official misconduct, we reverse the order and remand with directions to reinstate the unexpurgated indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-11\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-12\">Finally, we turn to the district court\u2019s alternative grounds<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> for dismissing Counts One, Two, Three and Four. After holding that substantial portions of the indictment must be dismissed or stricken<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> because of the alleged misconduct by SEC employees in attempting to settle the civil action brought by the SEC against those who are defendants in the criminal action, the district court stated that \u201cQuite apart from this basis for decision, there are alternative and compelling legal reasons why certain aspects of the indictment must be dismissed. ... In order that the case be fully stated for the possible consideration of higher authority, I shall state the reasoning which underlies these alternative conclusions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b708-13\">The district court then stated its alternative grounds (A) for dismissing Counts One, Two and Three, namely, that, for lack of materiality, the nondisclosure of the ERD kickbacks did not constitute violations of Section 17(a) of the 1933 Act or of the false statements statute, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 (1976); and (B) for dismissing Count Four, namely, that disclosure of the Westcalind and ERD kickbacks in TDA\u2019s proxy statements in December 1971 was not required by Section 14(a) of the 1934 Act and the proxy rules promulgated thereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-14\">We disagree with the district court\u2019s alternative grounds for dismissal of Counts One, Two, Three and Four. We reverse its rulings on this aspect of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-15\">(A) <em>Materality of Nondisclosure of ERD Kickbacks Under Counts One, Two and Three.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b708-16\">The district court dismissed Counts One, Two and Three which relate to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>ERD kickbacks described in paragraphs 10(f) through 10(h) of Count One. The offense charged in Counts One and Two in substance is that one of the means employed by defendants in their fraudulent scheme was to issue a prospectus for a public offering of TDA common stock in November 1971 which was false and misleading in that it failed to disclose <em>material facts </em>\u2014 in violation of Section 17(a) of the 1933 Act.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Count Three charges defendants with having filed with the SEC a prospectus which concealed <em>material facts </em>\u2014 in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 (1976).<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-5\">The theory upon which the district court dismissed these counts, as urged by defendants\u2019 counsel, was that as a matter of law the failure to disclose the ERD kickback transactions in the prospectus did not constitute violations of the statutes because the failure to disclose such transactions was not <em>material </em>to an informed decision by a prospective purchaser of TDA stock on the merits of investing in the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-6\">The error in the district court\u2019s ruling in this respect is best pointed up by the Supreme Court\u2019s definition of \u201cmateriality\u201d and the Court\u2019s admonition against deciding that issue as a matter of law in <em>TSC Industries, Inc. v.

In considering whether summary judgment on the issue is appropriate, we must bear in mind that the underlying objective facts, which will often be free from dispute, are merely the starting point for the ultimate determination of materiality. The determination requires delicate assessments of the inferences a \u2018reasonable shareholder\u2019 would draw from a given set of facts and the significance of those inferences to him, and these assessments are peculiarly ones for the trier of fact. <em>Only if the established omissions are \u2018so obviously important to an investor, that reasonable minds cannot differ on the question of materiality\u2019 is the ultimate issue of materiality appropriately resolved \u2018as a matter of law\u2019 by summary judgment.\u201d Id. </em>at 450.

Tucker and Perlmutter, which took place on January 14, 1975, Tucker was advised that defense counsel\u2019s objective was \u201cthe avoidance of a criminal reference\u201d and this was made clear to the same SEC counsel at a meeting on February 28, 1975. Moreover, after rejecting Tucker\u2019s testimony to the effect that he had in September 1975 told defense counsel that there was \u201cno deal on criminal\u201d Judge Haight further found that on September 30, 1975, former Judge Streit, who was substituting for Mr. Gould as chief defense counsel, advised that \u201cin light of the fact that there [was] to be no criminal prosecution,\u201d he would endeav- or to obtain the amount of the repayment demanded by the SEC, to which Tucker and Perlmutter made no response even though Perlmutter had in the interim been in communication with the U.S. Attorney about the case. In October 1975 Perlmutter confirmed to a lawyer representing a prospective outside director of TDA that there would be no criminal reference, and an attorney for appellant Sandberg told Tucker and Perlmutter that he would advise his client to settle, since settlement was \u201cbetter than going over to the golden dome [U.S. Courthouse],\u201d to which the SEC counsel made no response.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-9\">Once they were advised by appellants\u2019 counsel of the basis on which the latter were proceeding, SEC counsel surely owed an ethical obligation immediately to correct the record by advising counsel that they had already initiated an informal criminal reference or at least that they felt free to do so. However, since appellants\u2019 counsel, with no viable alternative, faced the prospect that the incriminating evidence would in any event be forwarded by the New York County District Attorney to the SEC without restrictions on its use no prejudice warranting dismissal of the indictment is shown.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
