In August 1977 a criminal investigation began. The IRS served a summons for production of records on Mr. Simons\u2019 employer, Southwest Drywall, and sent appellants notice of the summons by certified mail. Appellants refused to pick up their mail and did not attempt to intervene in the summons procedure. Southwest Drywall complied with the summons. The appellants then filed a motion in the district court for the return of the seized records and their suppression in any further criminal proceeding. The district court upheld the legality of the summons and denied all relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-25\">Under the standard set forth in <em>Di-Bella v. United States, </em>369 U.S. 121, 82 S.Ct. 654, 7 L.Ed.2d 614 (1962), the denial of the appellant\u2019s motion is appealable only if \u201cthe motion is solely for the return of property and is in no way tied to a criminal prosecution in esse against the movant.\u201d 369 U.S. at 131-32, 82 S.Ct. at 660, 7 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>L.Ed.2d at 621. We have interpreted <em>Di-Bella </em>broadly, holding that only if the motion is \u201ca collateral attempt to retrieve property and not an effort to suppress evidence in related criminal proceedings is it appealable.\u201d <em>United States v. Glassman, </em>533 F.2d 262 (5th Cir. 1976). In <em>Glassman </em>we held that denial of a motion for the return of property and suppression of evidence was not appealable even in the absence of the existence of any formal criminal charges at the time of appeal. 533 F.2d at 263. <em>See also United States v. Peachtree, </em>456 F.2d 442, 447-48 (5th Cir. 1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">The \u201cproperty\u201d which the appellants seek returned in this case consists of W-2 and W \u2014 4(e) forms, expense checks and vouchers, payroll checks, and other employment records, all kept in the files of Mr. Simons\u2019 employer. It is obvious that the appellants\u2019 motion is directed at the suppression of this evidence in any criminal proceeding arising from the IRS criminal investigation and is not a collateral action for the return of property. The district court\u2019s order is nonappealable, and we therefore dismiss for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
