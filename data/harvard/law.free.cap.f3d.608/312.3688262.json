Occupational Safety and Health Commission, </em>290 Fed.Appx. 656 (5th Cir.2008) <em>(StarTran I). </em>The Commission thereafter remanded the case to the Commission Administrative Law Judge (ALJ). The ALJ subsequently issued his ruling (without taking any further evidence) holding that StarTran was not exempt as a political subdivision under section 652(5). Although StarTran petitioned the commission for discretionary review of that decision, the commission did not direct review. Thus the ALJ\u2019s decision on remand be<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>came the final order of the Commission under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 661(j). StarTran has timely petitioned this court for review under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 660(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">CONTEXT FACTS AND LEGAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">The words \u201cpolitical subdivision\u201d appearing in section 652(5) are not defined in the Act. Similarly, the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), which likewise covers \u201cemployers\u201d and provides that \u201cthe term \u2018employer\u2019 \u201d shall not include \u201cany State or political subdivision thereof,\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(2), contains no definition of \u201cpolitical subdivision.\u201d In <em>N.L.R.B. v. Natural Gas Util. Dist. of Hawkins County, Tenn., </em>402 U.S. 600, 91 S.Ct. 1746, 29 L.Ed.2d 206 (1971), the Supreme Court considered whether the NLRB had correctly held that the utility district was <em>not </em>a \u201cpolitical subdivision\u201d so as to be exempt from the NLRA under section 152(2). The Court noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-6\">\u201c... the Board ... \u2018has limited the exemption for political subdivisions to entities that are either (1) created directly by the state, so as to constitute departments or administrative arms of the government, or (2) administered by individuals who are responsible to public officials or to the general electorate.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-7\"><em>Id. </em>at 1749.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In holding that the NLRB had erred \u201cin determining in light of the Board\u2019s own test\u201d that utility district was <em>not </em>a political subdivision, <em>id. </em>at 1749-50, the Court went on to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-8\">\u201cThe Board found that \u2018the Employer in this case is neither created directly by the State, nor administered by State-appointed or elected officials.\u2019 167 N.L.R.B., at 691-692 (footnotes omitted). But the Board test is not whether the entity is administered by \u2018State-appointed or elected officials.\u2019 Rather, alternative (2) of the test is whether the entity is \u2018administered <em>by individuals who are responsible to public officials </em>or to the general electorate\u2019 (emphasis added), and the Tennessee statute makes crystal clear that respondent [the district] is administered by a Board of Commissioners appointed by an elected county judge, and subject to removal proceedings at the instance of the Governor, the county prosecutor, or private citizens.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 1750.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b340-14\">About seven months after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in the <em>Hawkins County </em>case, the Secretary of Labor promulgated 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1975.5, a new regulation interpreting, for the first time, the political subdivision exemption of section 652(2). 37 Fed.Reg., No. 14, at 630-31, January 21, 1972. That regulation has not since been amended. As the Secretary\u2019s brief herein correctly states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b340-15\">\u201cThe regulation sets out the following two tests for a state political subdivision, which ask whether the entity \u2018has been (1) created directly by the State so as to constitute a department or administrative arm of the state government; or (2) administered by individuals who are controlled by public officials and responsible to such officials or to the general electorate\u2019. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1975.5(b).\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b341-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>The Secretary and StarTran treat the foregoing two alternative tests as being essentially the same as the above quoted test set out in the <em>Hawkins County </em>case, 81 S.Ct. at 1749, for the NLRA political subdivision exemption (\u00a7 152(2)). In what appears to be the first reported judicial decision construing the section 1975.5, the Seventh Circuit in <em>Brock v. Chicago Zoological Soc., </em>820 F.2d 909 (7th Cir.1987), stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-18\">\u201cThe Secretary of Labor\u2019s regulations set forth a two-part test for determining whether an entity is a state or political subdivision. Under this test, any entity that is \u2018(1) created directly by the State, so as to constitute a department or administrative arm of the government, or (2) administered by individuals who are controlled by public officials and responsible to such officials or to the general public\u2019 will be deemed to be a state or political subdivision under \u00a7 625(5). 29 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>C.F.R. \u00a7 1975.5(b). This test is identical to the formula the National Labor Relations Board has long used to determine whether an entity is a political subdivision exempt from the Board\u2019s jurisdiction under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(2).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 910 (citing <em>Hawkins County).</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">StarTran\u2019s claim of exemption as a \u201cpolitical subdivision\u201d relies on the second alternative test of section 1975.5(b) \u2014 namely that it is \u201cadministered by individuals who are controlled by public officials and responsible to such officials or to the general electorate\u201d \u2014 is grounded on its relationship to Capital Metropolitan Transit (Capital Metro) in Austin, Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Capital Metro was established in 1985 under Texas law (then Tbx.Rev.Civ. Stat. art. 1118x). It assumed the assets of the former City of Austin Transit System. Capital Metro operates under Chapter 451 of the Texas Transportation Code. <em>See </em>Tex. Transportation Code \u00a7 451.052(a)(1), and \u201cis a public political entity and corporate body\u201d that \u201cexercises public and essential governmental functions.\u201d Its board of directors is responsible for its management, operations and control, and employs a general manager or chief executive officer administering its daily operations (see <em>id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 451.053, 451.101, 451.106). The undisputed and unchallenged evidence is that Capital Metro\u2019s board of directors consists of seven members, five of whom are elected public officials. It is indisputably a political subdivision of the State of Texas, and its officers and directors are indisputably public officials.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-11\">Prior to the creation of StarTran and its contract with Capital Metro effective January 1, 1992, Capital Metro (and before it, the City of Austin) contracted with Management Labor Services (MLS), an outside contractor, for labor (and possible other) services for operation of the Austin Transit System. With the 1991 ending of Capital Metro\u2019s relationship with MLS (the reasons for which are not reflected in the record), in order to continue to be eligible for federal financial assistance of certain kinds provided under the Federal Transit Act it was apparently necessary, <em>inter alia, </em>to preserve the collective bargaining rights of the MLS employees (covered by the then collective bargaining agreement between MLS and Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1091) who had been servicing the Capital Metro operations. <em>See </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 5333(b).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> However, Capital Met<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>ro, as a political subdivision of the State of Texas, is prohibited by Texas law from entering into a collective bargaining agreement with a labor union or recognizing a union as the bargaining agent for its employees. <em>See </em>Texas Government Code \u00a7 617.002.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In an effort to qualify for federal financial assistance under the Federal Transit Act, while not violating those prohibitions of Texas law, Capital Metro, by resolution of its board of directors in November 1991 formed StarTran as a nonprofit corporation under the Texas NonProfit Corporation Act (Art. 1396-1.011-11.01, Tex.Rev.Civ.Stats.), on December 6, 1991.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Thereafter, on December 31, 1991, effective January 1, 1992, StarTran and Capital Metro entered into a contract by which StarTran generally agreed to employ and provide to Capital Metro the services of drivers and mechanics and others in Capital Metro\u2019s mass transit operations and agreed \u201cto be bound by the terms and conditions of the existing collective agreements with Unions.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The December 31, 1991 capital Metro-StarTran contract recites that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-15\">\u201cWHEREAS, to ensure compliance with both state and federal law, it is necessary for Capital Metro to obtain certain services from an independent entity which can recognize the collective bargaining rights of those persons who provide Mass Transit Service for Capital Metro; ... \u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b343-16\">The contract between Capital Metro and StarTran, as amended in 1997, rewrites the original contract\u2019s article II \u201cstatus of StarTran\u201d to add, among other things, a provision, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b343-17\">\u201cCapital Metro shall have no right to supervise or control the duties and activities of StarTran so as to cause a violation of the provisions of Chapter 617 of the Texas Government Code or 49 U.S.C. Section 5333. It is the intent of the parties that, for purposes of Collective Bargaining, StarTran is an independent corporate entity which shall in no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>way be deemed to be an affiliate, partner, subsidiary, joint venturer, or otherwise under the control of Capital Metro.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">The testimony of the president of the local union representing the StarTran bus drivers and mechanics, called as a witness by the Secretary, was that Capital Metro \u201chad to approve\u201d any proposed collective bargaining agreement. There was no evidence contrary to this testimony or to the witness\u2019s assertion that Capital Metro had never refused such approval. The union president likewise testified that he had \u201cdiscussed many personnel and collective bargaining issues [of concern to him as union president] with Mr. Gilliam [the general manager of Capital Metro] or his predecessor at Capital Metro,\u201d and that in the last three years he had had \u201cseveral meetings with Mr. Gilliam and also the board of directions [of Capital Metro] relating to the issues we\u2019ve had to deal with.\u201d He further explained \u201c[w]hen we can\u2019t get something done by working at StarTran, we go on to the next step or we\u2019ll go to Mr. Gilliam. And then if we can\u2019t get it done there, we\u2019ll go to the [Capital Metro] board and we go public.\u201d Again, this testimony was not controverted.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">There is no evidence of any ruling\u2014 formal or informal \u2014 by any official or agency under the NLRA, or by any court, that StarTran is (or is not) an employer covered by the NLRA or is (or is not) a \u201cpolitical subdivision\u201d under section 152(2). However, StarTran does not, and apparently has never, taken the position that it is not covered by the NLRA. There does not appear to be any ruling by any Texas court or agency, or by the Texas Attorney General, respecting whether or not Star-Tran is a \u201cpolitical subdivision of the state\u201d of Texas within the meaning of section 617.002 of the Texas Government Code (see note 6, <em>supra). </em>StarTran has claimed it is entitled to governmental immunity under the Texas Tort Claims Act <em>(see </em>Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem.Code, Ch. 101, \u00a7 101.101(3)(B)) and apparently one or two trial courts have agreed (in unpublished orders); and it is insured through the Texas Municipal League Intergovernmental Risk Pool, which insures only governmental entities.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-8\">As amended in 1993 the Capital MetroStarTran agreement provided that Star-Tran would \u201c[p]rovide safety and other training\u201d (the original agreement included \u201csafety and other training\u201d among the matters to be provided by Capital Metro). The undisputed evidence is that an employee of Capital Metro, its safety director who reported to Capital Metro\u2019s risk manager (also a Capital Metro employee), established and from time to time amended the safety program and the safety training program which were applicable and applied to StarTran and Capital Metro and their employees, and conducted and supervised training exercises thereunder. However, discipline of bargaining unit employees for safety violations, or otherwise, was handled by StarTran and the union under the collective bargaining agreement. The evidence also established that StarTran and Capital Metro are both subject to (and in compliance with) the Federal Transit Administration requirement to have a safety program which that agency reviews ev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>ery three years, as well as to state law safety program requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">The Capital Metro-StarTran agreement has always contained the provision that the \u201cservices [to be] provided by Capital Metro shall be ministerial only, and that Star-Tran shall retain absolute and real day-today control over all matters relating to the terms and conditions of employment, supervision, and control of its employees.\u201d The undisputed evidence is that at all times Capital Metro has furnished all the buses (which are all marked as being Capital metro buses; the drivers wear \u201cStar-Tran\u201d or \u201cStarTran in Service to Capital Metro\u201d uniform shirts), and other equipment, facilities and office space, and has determined the fares, routes and schedules for the bus service, as well as furnished all insurance and all clerical, budgeting and accounting services, and all funds to Star-Tran. StarTran has <em>no </em>source of funds or revenue other than Capital Metro. Any StarTran expenditure must be approved by Capital Metro. StarTran has at no time had <em>any assets </em>other than its employees.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">The Capital Metro-StarTran contract has never had any fixed term and has always been expressly terminable by either party \u201cgiving 180 days written notice of its intent to do so.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">StarTran does not have, and has never had, any business relationship with any other party other than Capital Metro (or the union) and does not, and has never, furnished employees or services to any entity other than Capital Metro. It does not and could not exist or function apart from its relationship with Capital Metro.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-10\">The StarTran board of directors consists of the five persons who hold specified executive positions with StarTran (director of transportation, superintendent of maintenance, director of maintenance, director of special transit services, and manager of labor relations). The persons holding those positions are each StarTran employees who are selected by the president and general manager of Capital Metro (Fred Gilliam, elected to that position by the Capital Metro board). If and when any such StarTran employee ceases to hold such specified StarTran executive position, he or she ceases to be a member of the StarTran board of directors, and his or her successor in that executive position assumes that place on the StarTran board. The president of Capital Metro hires these StarTran executives, fixes their compensation (which is funded by Capital Metro) and has the power to transfer them to other StarTran positions (and hence to remove them from the StarTran board) and to appoint another StarTran employee to that specified executive position (and hence to that place on the StarTran board). Those StarTran executives are at will employees who may be terminated by the president of Capital Metro. All this is according to the by-laws of StarTran, as testified to without objection by its president and manager of labor relations, Ken McCulloch (who had the StarTran by-laws with him while testifying) and is unquestioned.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Further, McCulloch testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>that Gilliam, as CEO of Capital Metro, is his (McCulloch\u2019s) \u201cboss as president and labor relations manager of StarTran.\u201d Similarly, Dan Peabody, StarTran board member and director of transportation, testified that his \u201cboss as director of transportation\u201d is \u201cFred Gilliam,\u201d the CEO of Capital Metro. Peabody, as StarTran director of transportation, and Steve Herrera, the StarTran director of maintenance, each have \u201cscheduled biweekly meetings\u201d with Gilliam, Capital Metro CEO, as transportation and maintenance are \u201cthe two largest components of StarTran.\u201d Peabody further testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-4\">\u201cAnd then on a monthly basis Mr. Gilliam meets with the StarTran board of directors. And then for me, I usually have a phone conversation with Mr. Gilliam on a daily basis or I have scheduled meetings with him to where I bring him up to speed on some of the things that we\u2019re doing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-5\">Q. Again, he is your boss; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b346-6\">A. That\u2019s correct, he works on developing my PMP, which is your evaluation system, through which we receive our raises on an annual basis.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b346-7\">Peabody specifically testified that McCulloch (StarTran president and director of labor relations) was <em>not </em>his \u201cboss\u201d and that he did <em>not </em>\u201creport to Mr. McCulloch at all.\u201d Finally, Peabody explained that when an ice storm hit the area he made recommendations to Gilliam, and Gilliam made the final decision, as to what levels of bus service, if any, would be provided throughout that day.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b346-10\">In our prior opinion we vacated the Commission\u2019s decision and remanded for reconsideration because the Commission had failed to properly acknowledge the actual \u201cevidence regarding control of StarTran\u2019s board.\u201d We also noted that the Secretary [in her brief] \u201cdoes not appear to find the commission\u2019s public control factor significant or determinative\u201d and that \u201cthe Secretary [in her brief] emphasizes StarTran\u2019s day to day control of its employees instead of Capital Metro\u2019s control of StarTran\u2019s board.\u201d We stated that \u201c[b]ecause the Commission and the Secretary appear to set forth somewhat different interpretations of the regulation at issue [section 1975.5], on remand the Commission should defer to the Secretary\u2019s interpretation, to the extent that it is reasonable ....,\u201d citing <em>Martin v. Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission, </em>499 U.S. 144, 111 S.Ct. 1171, 1176, 113 L.Ed.2d 117 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-11\">On remand, the ALJ\u2019s decision\u2014which became the decision of the Commission-that StarTran was not a political subdivision under section 1975.5 basically rested on the ALJ\u2019s determination, based on the original hearing record, \u201cthat Capital Metro might ultimately have the authority to dismiss a member of StarTran\u2019s board or its president does not nullify the fact that it is StarTran that controls the day to day working conditions of its employees\u201d and that \u201cthose factors that relate to the day-to-day control of employees, including employee health and safety[,] demonstrate that such controls [sic] lies almost exclusively with StarTran. Therefore, for pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>poses of the Act, StarTran is not a political subdivision of the State of Texas.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">The undisputed evidence is that Star-Tran\u2019s entire board of directors, and each of its executives, all of whom are at will employees, are appointed and subject to removal by Capital Metro\u2019s board of directors and/or its CEO (who are public officials), acting in their sole discretion and without any requirement of cause, their compensation is fixed by Capital Metro\u2019s CEO (who may terminate or transfer them at will) and is wholly funded by Capital Metro, and the StarTran executives heading its departments report to the Capital Metro CEO (not to the StarTran president) and regard him as their \u201cboss.\u201d Under any reasonable reading of the language of section 1975(b)(2), one can only conclude that StarTran is \u201cadministered by individuals who are controlled by public officials and responsible to such officials,\u201d as stated therein.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">The Secretary contends that the decisions in <em>Brock v. Chicago Zoological Society, </em>820 F.2d 909 (7th Cir.1987), and <em>Tricil Resources v. Brock, </em>842 F.2d 141 (6th Cir.1988), the only reported circuit court decisions addressing section 1975.5, support the decision on remand. In <em>Chicago Zoological Society, </em>the issue was whether the Society, a private, nonprofit corporation created in 1921, came within the second alternative test under section 1975.5(b)(2) by reason of its relationship with the local Illinois forest preserve district (the District), a local governmental entity, by reason of the Society\u2019s 1926 contract with the District under which the Society was given the \u201centire control and management of the Zoo,\u201d located on land owned by the District. In holding that th\u00e9 Society was not a political subdivision under section 1975.5(b)(2), the Court noted that under the Society\u2019s charter and by-laws it is managed by its thirty-five person board of trustees, of whom only one is a public official (the president of the District\u2019s board). The Society\u2019s board of trustees is elected by its 240 governing members, of whom only four are public officials. <em>Id. </em>at 912. The Court went on to say:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-9\">\u201cThe [Society\u2019s board of] trustees ... [is] responsible for developing zoo policies and electing officers, including the president, who oversees the day-to-day operations of the zoo. <em>The District has no appointment and removal power </em>and no direct role in the zoo\u2019s operation and maintenance.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b347-10\">The Society\u2019s private, nonprofit corporate structure <em>effectively </em>insulates its of<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>ficers from District control over <em>management decisions. </em>The officers, who handle the zoo\u2019s day-to-day operations, owe their positions to the trustees and, indirectly, to the governing members. Among these latter two groups the District enjoys only nominal representation. Over 97% of the trustees and over 98% of the governing members are private citizens unbeholden to the District or any other state agency. Considering in addition that the <em>District possesses no power to appoint or remove the Society\u2019s managerial officers, those officers </em>clearly do not owe the sort of \u2018direct personal accountability to public officials or to the general public\u2019 that would <em>entitle </em>the Society to a political subdivision exemption.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 912 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">The present case is the polar opposite of <em>Chicago Zoological Society. </em>Moreover, the foregoing language from that opinion is clear that what is relevant for purposes of the section 1975.5(b)(2) alternative test is whether a governmental entity (Capital Metro) and/or public officer (Capital Metro CEO) has the power to appoint and remove the board and/or the \u201cmanagerial officers\u201d of the putative political subdivision (StarTran).<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">The Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Tricil Resources, Inc. </em>followed and relied on the Seventh Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Chicago Zoological Society. </em>In <em>Tricil </em>the issue was whether Tricil Resources Inc. (Tricil) fell within the political subdivision test under section 1975.5(b)(2). The Sixth Circuit held it did not. Tricil was \u201ca private for profit corporation\u201d which, under contract with the City, for some three and a half years, ran the daily operations of the City owned plant which converted garbage to energy sold by the City. Under the contract, the city paid Tricil an annual minimum fee, and reimbursed it all costs and expenses it incurred while managing the plant, and also would pay Tricil a bonus if the net plant operating income exceeded what had been projected. During the three and a half years Tricil managed the plant \u201cit received more than $19 million in operating fees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 141-42. The contract required Tricil to \u201cmaintain safety logs to comply with the Occupational Safety and Health Act\u201d and to employ sufficient qualified operating personnel to accomplish its duties under the contract. Tricil \u201chired all ... [plant] employees, determined their pay and issued their paychecks,\u201d and covered them under its employee benefit plans; it \u201cpaid state, local and federal income taxes\u201d (as well as social security taxes for its employees). <em>Id. </em>It is obvious that the City did not create Tricil, was not a Tricil stockholder, and had no power to appoint or remove any member of Tricil\u2019s board of directors or any of its executive officers (or \u201cmanagerial officers\u201d). Nothing in the opinion remotely suggests otherwise. In <em>that </em>context, the court held that \u201cthe substantial fiscal control the City exercised over ... [the plant\u2019s] operation,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 143 (togeth<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>er with other miscellaneous factors such as Tricil\u2019s use of the City sales tax exemption number to purchase plant materials and supplies, and its lack of eminent domain power) did not alone suffice to bring Tricil within the political subdivision exemption under section 1975.5(b)(2) when none of its board of directors or executive officers were selected or removable by the City (or other public official or authority). Again, <em>Tricil Resources Inc. </em>is the polar opposite of the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\"><em>No case </em>under section 1975.5(b)(2) has been cited to us in which the political subdivision exception thereunder has been denied where a majority (here all) of the board of directors and the managerial officers of the assertedly exempt political subdivision, were selected or removable by public officials (here they are both). This is likewise true of eases construing the analogous NLRA exemption under 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 152(a).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b349-6\">The cases in this area have generally held that if a majority of the board of directors of the claimed political subdivision is <em>not </em>subject to selection or removal by public officials or the general electorate, then the entity <em>for that reason </em>fails the second alternative test for being apolitical subdivision under section 152(2). Thus, in <em>Jefferson County Community Center v. NLRB, </em>732 F.2d 122 (10th Cir.1984) (overruled in other respects, <em>Aramark Corp. v. NLRB, </em>179 F.3d 872, 874 nn. 2, 3 (10th Cir.1999)), the Court held that the Center was not exempt as a political subdivision under section 152.2, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Alp\">\u201cThe record ... demonstrates that although seven directors are appointed by public agencies under the Center\u2019s bylaws, a majority of the Board is neither appointed by nor subject to removal by public officials or the general electorate and has no official connection to any governmental body. Under these circumstances, the Center is not administered by individuals who are accountable to public officials or the general electorate. <em>Cf. Truman Medical Center, Inc., </em>[641 F.2d 570 (8th Cir.1981)] 641 F.2d at 573 (medical center held not political subdivision where 31 of 49 directors neither appointed by nor subject to removal by public officials or general public).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-9\">Similarly, in <em>NLRB v. Natchez Trace Power Ass\u2019n, </em>476 F.2d 1042 (5th Cir.1973), we held that the association was not a political subdivision under section 152(2), stating that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-10\">\u201c... it was organized by private citizens acting pursuant to the appropriate enabling statute, and in this respect its formation was no different from that of any private corporation organized under Mississippi law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-11\">The directors ... are initially those named by the citizens filing the certificate of incorporation; they serve a three-year term without compensation. Their successors are elected by the corporation\u2019s members and also serve for three years. The directors are empowered to do all things necessary or convenient in conducting the business of a corporation .... its directors are elected by its members and apparently are accountable only to them. The general public exercises no control over them. Not being created directly by the state and not being administered by individuals responsible to the public, Natchez Trace fails to meet either of the criteria one of which the Board requires of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>entity before it can qualify for the political subdivision exemption.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1045 (footnotes omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">There are simply no section 152(2) cases of which we are aware that have held an entity a majority of whose board of directors is selected and removable by public officials and whose principle executive officers are likewise selected and removable by public officials, is not one \u201cadministered by individuals who are responsible to public officials or to the general electorate\u201d and is not a political subdivision for purposes of section 152(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">We recognize that we owe deference to the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of her own interpretive regulations, and that we may not prefer another reasonable interpretation over the reasonable interpretation of the Secretary. <em>Martin v. OSHRC, </em>499 U.S. 144, 111 S.Ct. 1171, 1179, 113 L.Ed.2d 117 (1991). However, as the Court said in <em>Martin, </em>\u201cwe emphasize that the reviewing court should defer to the Secretary <em>only </em>if the Secretary\u2019s interpretation is reasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1179-80 (emphasis added). We further emphasize that we are not construing the exact boundaries of section 652(5) or the scope of the Secretary\u2019s power to promulgate regulations defining \u201cpolitical subdivision of a State\u201d as used therein. Rather, as in <em>Hawkins County, </em>we simply determine whether the Secretary\u2019s interpretation of section 1975.5, as applied here, is reasonable. We hold it is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">The second alternative \u201ctest\u201d of section 1975.5(b)(2) is whether StarTran is \u201cadministered by individuals who are controlled by public officials and responsible to such officials.\u201d Under any reasonable interpretation of those words, StarTran fits that definition: its board of directors is selected and removable by the CEO of Capital Metro, a public official (Capital Metro being a public political entity, five of the seven members of whose board of directors are officials elected by the general electorate) and StarTran\u2019s principle executive officers are all at will employees hired and subject to termination or transfer (and to having their pay set by) by Capital Metro\u2019s CEO; StarTran has no assets except its employees, and in substance has no existence independent of capital Metro (its creator) and no relationship with any other party (apart from the union). And, we are unaware of any court decision holding that an entity a majority of whose board of directors, and whose principle executive officers, are subject to selection and removal by one or more public officials or public entities does <em>not </em>meet the above quoted second alternative test of section 1975.5(b)(2) so as to be a political subdivision under section 652(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-10\">We hold that the ALJ\u2019s decision on remand, relying on the Secretary\u2019s contention that, despite Capital Metro\u2019s control of the StarTran board and executives, StarTran \u201ccontrols the day to day working conditions of its employees\u201d or has \u201cday to day control of [its] employees\u201d and hence fails to meet the section 1975.5(b)(2) test, is an unreasonable interpretation of section 1975.5. The matters of \u201ccontrol of day to day working conditions of employees\u201d or \u201cday-to-day control of employees,\u201d or the equivalent thereof, <em>are not mentioned anywhere </em>in section 1975.5. The \u201cfactors\u201d mentioned in section 1975.5(c) as examples of those which may be \u201ctaken into account\u201d in regard to whether either of the \u201ctests\u201d of section 1975.5(b) is met, overwhelmingly point to StarTran\u2019s satisfaction of the section 1975.5(b)(2) criteria. While it is true that section 1975.5(d) does state that the section 1975.5(c) \u201clist of factors is not exclusive,\u201d that, in our view, is simply not a sufficient basis on which to reasonably construe section 1975(b)(2)\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>which states one of the two alternative \u201ctests\u201d for meeting the exemption \u2014 as being subject to a requirement <em>nowhere mentioned </em>in the entire regulation and which seems strongly contrary to any reasonable understanding of the wording of section 1975.5(b)(2) as written. Moreover, the jurisprudence above cited clearly reflects that section 1975.5(b)(2) concerns itself with whether the board of directors and/or the \u201cmanagerial officers\u201d of the asserted \u201cpolitical subdivision\u201d (not its foremen or lower level supervisors) are \u201ccontrolled by public officials and responsible to\u201d them \u201cor to the general electorate.\u201d To allow the Secretary to add, on an ad hoc individual case by case basis, controlling requirements for meeting the political subdivision test of section 1975(b)(2) that are nowhere mentioned in section 1975.5, is to in effect render the regulation meaningless, and essentially say that a political subdivision is whatever the Secretary thinks it is in each or any particular case. That is simply not reasonable. <em>See, e.g., Acadian Gas Pipeline System v. FERC, </em>878 F.2d 865, 868 (5th Cir.1989) (\u201cWhile an agency interpretation of a regulation is entitled to due deference, the interpretation must rationally flow from the language of the regulation ... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">We reverse the decision of the Commission and render judgment dismissing the citation against StarTran.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">REVERSED and RENDERED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b340-9\">.

In the interests of accuracy, we note that there are some minor differences in wording between the NLRB tests and those under \u00a7 1975.5(b).
