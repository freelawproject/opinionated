United States, </em>559 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 1265, 176 L.Ed.2d 1 (2010). <em>Harris v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 1734, 176 L.Ed.2d 209 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-28\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1249-29\">At the center of this case is the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), which imposes a 15-year mandatory minimum prison sentence on a person who has been convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm, if the person has three earlier convictions \u201cfor a violent felony or a serious drug offense, or both.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1). A \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the ACCA is a crime punishable by a prison term of more than one year that also:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1250-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1224\">*1224</page-number>(i) has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1250-4\">(ii) is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves the use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1250-5\"><em>Id. </em>\u00a7 924(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-6\">The outcome of this case depends on whether Donald Ray Harris\u2019 Florida state conviction for sexual battery of a child under the age of sixteen is a violent felony under the residual clause in \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii), which is the part of the statutory provision beginning with \u201cotherwise.\u201d Harris\u2019 crime is not burglary, arson, extortion, or an offense involving the use of explosives. But it does meet the plain language requirement of \u201cotherwise involving] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). Even though it fits in the plain language of the statute, we must apply the holding of <em>Be-gay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 143, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 1585, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008), that strict liability crimes are not \u201croughly similar\u201d to burglary, arson, extortion, or an offense involving the use of explosives and therefore do not come within the residual clause. <em>See id. </em>at 145, 128 S.Ct. at 1586-87. Before we get to our discussion of that rough similarity requirement for residual clause crimes, we follow the Supreme Court\u2019s instruction to reconsider this case in light of <em>Johnson, </em>559 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 1265, 176 L.Ed.2d 1, which involves the first definition of \u201cviolent felony\u201d in the ACCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-12\">\n<em>A</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-13\">In <em>Johnson </em>the Supreme Court considered whether the defendant\u2019s earlier Florida simple battery conviction was a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i)\u2014 one that \u201chas as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i). Johnson contended that his 2003 battery conviction could not be counted to classify him as an armed career criminal under \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i). 130 S.Ct. at 1268-69.</p>\n<p id=\"b1250-14\">Under the Florida statute that Johnson had been convicted of violating, a battery could be committed in any one of three ways: by intentionally causing bodily harm to the victim, or by intentionally striking the victim, or by actually and intentionally touching the victim. <em>Id. </em>at 1269; <em>see </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.03(l)(a). The Supreme Court determined that nothing in the record of Johnson\u2019s 2003 battery conviction established that he did anything more than the least of those three things: \u201c \u2018actually and intentionally touch[ing]\u2019 the victim.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> 130 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1225\">*1225</page-number>S.Ct. at 1269 (quoting Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.03(1)(a) (brackets omitted)). As a result, Johnson\u2019s battery conviction could only be counted for the purpose of classifying him as an armed career criminal if \u201c \u2018[actually and intentionally toueh[ing] another person\u2019, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 784.03(1)(a), (2) (2003), \u2018has as an element the use ... of physical force against the person of another.\u2019 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1268. The Court held that it did not because \u201cphysical force\u201d in the context of the ACCA\u2019s \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i) means \u201cviolent force.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1271. The result was that Johnson\u2019s battery conviction could not be counted for ACCA purposes. <em>See id. </em>at 1269,1274.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-5\">The government had asked the Supreme Court to remand the <em>Johnson </em>case to this Court so that we could determine whether Johnson\u2019s battery conviction was a violent felony under the residual clause in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). <em>Id. </em>at 1274. The reasons the Court declined to do so are that \u201c[t]he Government did not keep this option alive because it disclaimed at sentencing any reliance upon the residual clause,\u201d and this Court had already implicitly decided that the residual clause did not apply in those circumstances. <em>Id. </em>That same residual clause is at the center of the present case, and we must determine if it applies to Harris\u2019 Florida state court conviction for sexual battery of a child under sixteen years of age. Before doing that, we will set out the procedural facts that frame this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-6\">\n<em>B.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-7\">Harris was convicted by a jury of being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). <em>Harris, </em>305 Fed.App\u2019x at 553. He was sentenced to 240 months in prison as an armed career criminal. <em>Id. </em>Harris achieved that status by being convicted twice for selling cocaine and <em>once for </em>sexual battery <em>of </em>a child under the age of sixteen in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04(3) (1996) (amended 1999).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>The government proved all three crimes \u201cby submitting certified copies of Harris\u2019 convictions, which were based on guilty pleas.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 553-54.</p>\n<p id=\"b1251-12\">One issue we decided in reviewing Harris\u2019 sentence was whether his sexual battery conviction under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04(3) was a violent felony within the meaning of \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i). <em>See id. </em>at 554-56. Harris had been convicted under the 1996 version of \u00a7 800.04(3), which provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1251-13\">800.04. Lewd, lascivious, or indecent assault or act upon or in presence of child</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1251-14\">A person who:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1251-15\">(3) Commits an act defined as sexual battery under s. 794.011(l)(h) upon any child under the age of 16 years ... is guilty of a felony of the second degree</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1251-16\"><em>Id. </em>at 555 (quoting Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04(3) (1990-1996)). That version of the statute also provided that \u201c[u]nder \u00a7 794.011(1)(h), \u2018Sexual battery means oral, anal, or vaginal penetration by, or union with, the sexual organ of another.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 556. We noted that \u201c[i]n his arguments to the district court Harris repeatedly referred to his crime as \u2018statutory rape,\u2019 \u201d but that did not do him any good because the district court concluded that statutory rape is a crime of violence. <em>Id. </em>at 555. We reached the same conclusion and held that \u201cunder this Court\u2019s minimal physical contact requirement, a violation of Fla. Stat. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1226\">*1226</page-number>\u00a7 800.04(3) (1996) is a violent felony.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 556.</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-4\">Under the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Johnson </em>decision, in order for a crime to be a \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i) violent felony, it must involve \u201cphysical force,\u201d which \u201cmeans <em>violent </em>force \u2014 that is force capable of causing physical pain or injury to another person.\u201d <em>Johnson, </em>130 S.Ct. at 1271. The government now concedes that Harris\u2019 sexual battery conviction is not a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i), and we accept that concession for purposes of this case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1252-5\">Left for us to decide is whether Harris\u2019 conviction under \u00a7 800.04(3) qualifies as a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the residual clause contained in \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii)\u2019s definition of the term. The residual clause defines \u201cviolent felony\u201d as a crime punishable by imprisonment for more than one year that is not \u201cburglary, arson, or extortion\u201d and does not involve use of explosives, but \u201cotherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-6\">Harris contends that the government has waived any reliance on the residual clause because the last time this case was before us the government represented (correctly under the law of the circuit as it then existed) that it was unnecessary for us to consider that clause. <em>See </em>Br. of Appellee (filed Aug. 20, 2008) at 18 (\u201cBecause Harris\u2019s conviction for violating section 800.04(3) falls squarely within the ambit of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i), resort to the \u2018residual provision\u2019 of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) is unnecessary....\u201d). Harris also argues that the government should be barred from relying on the residual clause because it did not ask the district court to rule in the alternative that the residual clause applied when that court was addressing the physical force required under \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b1252-10\">The government never disclaimed reliance on the residual clause in this Court, but simply pointed out to us that under the state of the law at the time there was no need for us to reach the issue of whether the residual clause applied. We agreed and did not reach the issue.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Much the same thing happened in the district court, which concluded as a matter of law that statutory rape was a violent felony under \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i), rendering it pointless to decide anything about \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) and its residual clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1227\">*1227</page-number>Even though the district court did not reach the residual clause issue, we can still decide it. <em>See United States v. Al-Arian, </em>514 F.3d 1184, 1189 (11th Cir.2008) (\u201c[W]e may affirm for any reason supported by the record, even if not relied upon by the district court.\u201d) (quotation marks omitted); <em>see also United States v. Day, </em>465 F.3d 1262, 1264 (11th Cir.2006) (\u201cThis court reviews de novo whether a particular conviction is a violent felony for purposes of the ACCA.\u201d).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1253-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-6\">Three Supreme Court decisions guide our analysis of whether a crime is a violent felony under the ACCA\u2019s residual clause. <em>See United States v. Hams, </em>586 F.3d 1283, 1288 (11th Cir.2009).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Here is how we go about deciding that issue in each case that presents it to us:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1253-7\">As the Court instructed us in <em>James [v. United States, </em>550 U.S. 192, 198, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 1591, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007)], we begin with a categorical approach to this crime. We read the face of [the relevant statute] itself to discern the crime as it is ordinarily committed. Necessarily, we consider whether the crime poses a \u201cserious potential risk of physical injury\u201d that is similar in degree to the risks posed by the enumerated crimes. As in <em>Begay </em>[v. <em>United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 143, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 1585, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008)], we examine next whether that crime was similar in kind and in degree to the enumerated crimes. Finally, under <em>Begay </em>and <em>Chambers </em>[v. <em>United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 687, 692, 172 L.Ed.2d 484 (2009)], we ask whether the conduct at issue in the statute is \u201cpurposeful, violent and aggressive,\u201d or, whether it is a more passive crime of inaction, such as the failure to report to a penal institution or driving under the influence of alcohol.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1253-13\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1253-14\">In <em>James </em>the Supreme Court considered whether attempted burglary under Florida law was a violent felony within the ACCA\u2019s residual clause. <em>See James, </em>550 U.S. at 198, 127 S.Ct. at 1591. The Court took into account the fact that the specifically listed crimes in the first part of \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) \u2014 burglary, arson, extortion, and crimes involving the use of explosives \u2014 \u201cwhile not technically crimes against the person, nevertheless create significant risks of bodily injury or confrontation that might result in bodily injury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 199, 127 S.Ct. at 1592. The Court reasoned that \u201cCongress\u2019 inclusion of a broad residual provision in clause (ii) indicates that it did not intend the preceding enumerated offenses to be an exhaustive list of the types of crimes that might present a serious risk of injury to others <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1228\">*1228</page-number>and therefore merit status as a \u00a7 924(e) predicate offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 200, 127 S.Ct. at 1593.</p>\n<p id=\"b1254-4\">The Court also explained in <em>James </em>that \u201c[t]he specific offenses enumerated in clause (ii) provide one baseline from which to measure whether other similar conduct \u2018otherwise ... presents a serious potential risk of physical injury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 203, 127 S.Ct. at 1594. However, \u201c[n]othing in the language of \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) rules out the possibility that an offense may present \u2018a serious risk of physical injury to another\u2019 without presenting as great a risk as any of the enumerated offenses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 209, 127 S.Ct. at 1598. <em>But see Begay, </em>553 U.S. at 143, 128 S.Ct. at 1585 (\u201c[T]o give effect to every clause and word of this statute, we should read the examples as limiting the crimes that clause (ii) covers to crimes that are roughly similar, in kind as well as in degree of risk posed, to the examples themselves.\u201d (quotation marks and alteration omitted)).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1254-5\">The <em>James </em>Court reasoned that the categorical approach does not require \u201cthat every conceivable factual offense covered by a statute must necessarily present a serious potential risk of injury before the offense can be deemed a violent felony.\u201d 550 U.S. at 208, 127 S.Ct. at 1597. Instead:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1254-9\">[T]he proper inquiry is whether the conduct encompassed by the elements of the offense, in the ordinary case, presents a serious potential risk of injury to another. One can always hypothesize unusual cases in which even a prototypically violent crime might not present a genuine risk of injury \u2014 for example, an attempted murder where the gun, unbeknownst to the shooter, had no bullets. Or, to take an example from the offenses specifically enumerated in \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii), one could imagine an extortion scheme where an anonymous blackmailer threatens to release embarrassing personal information about the victim unless he is mailed regular payments. In both cases, the risk of physical injury to another approaches zero. But that does not mean that the offenses <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1229\">*1229</page-number>of attempted murder or extortion are categorically nonviolent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1255-5\"><em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-6\">Harris hypothesizes that under Florida law a person could be convicted of the crime of sexual battery of a child under the age of sixteen \u201ceven when the act was unintentional and the victim factually consented to the act.\u201d Supp. Br. of Appellant at 12. He points out the possibility of \u201cfactual consent\u201d because legal consent is impossible under the statute. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04 (1996) (\u201cNeither the victim\u2019s lack of chastity nor the victim\u2019s consent is a defense to the crime proscribed by this section.\u201d). It makes no difference for conviction purposes if the perpetrator believes that the victim has in fact \u201cconsented.\u201d <em>See Jones v. State, </em>640 So.2d 1084, 1086 (Fla.1994) (\u201cThe legislature enacted section 800.04 based on a morally neutral judgment that sexual intercourse with a child under the age of sixteen, with or without consent, is potentially harmful to the child.\u201d (quotation marks and citation omitted)); <em>cf. United States v. Chavarriya-Mejia, </em>367 F.3d 1249, 1251 (11th Cir.2004) (\u201cBecause Kentucky law presumes that underage children are incapable of consent, statutory rape necessarily involves a sexual act performed \u2018against\u2019 the child.\u201d). A person could be convicted of violating Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04(3) without the actual use of physical force on the victim because the victim \u201cfactually consented.\u201d That alone, however, does not automatically mean that the crime is outside of the scope of the residual clause. \u201cAs long as [a violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04(3) is] an offense ... that, <em>by its nature, </em>presents a serious potential risk of injury to another\u201d it meets the threshold requirements. <em>James, </em>550 U.S. at 209, 127 S.Ct. at 1597 (emphasis added). So we must first determine whether the \u00a7 800.04(3) offense meets those requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b1255-9\">We have already half-answered that question. In <em>United States v. Rutherford, </em>175 F.3d 899 (11th Cir.1999), we held that a violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04 \u201c \u2018involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 905 (quoting U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2). We reached that holding in the context of the career offender sentencing guideline definition, but it involved language that is the same as that in the residual clause we are applying. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1255-10\">The defendant in <em>Rutherford </em>had been convicted of violating the 1993 version of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04, which contained a provision identical to the one that Harris was convicted of violating in 1996. The 1993 version of the statute provided that a person commits a second degree felony if he:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1255-11\">(1) Handles, fondles, or assaults any child under the age of 16 years in a lewd, lascivious, or indecent manner;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1255-12\">(2) Commits actual or simulated sexual intercourse, deviate sexual intercourse, sexual bestiality, masturbation, sadomasochistic abuse, actual lewd exhibition of the genitals, or any act or conduct which simulate[s] that sexual battery is being or will be committed upon any child under the age of 16 years or forces or entices the child to commit any such act;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1255-13\">(3) Commits an act define[d] as sexual battery under s. 794.011(1)( [h]) upon any child under the age of 16 years; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1255-14\">(4) Knowingly commits any lewd or lascivious act in the presence of any child under the age of 16 years, without committing the crime of sexual battery....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1255-15\"><em>Id. </em>at 905 n. 3 (quoting Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04 (1993)).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1256-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1230\">*1230</page-number>The record did not indicate which subsection of \u00a7 800.04 Rutherford had been convicted of violating, but we concluded that it did not matter. <em>Id. </em>at 904-05. We reasoned that the conduct described in all of that statute\u2019s subsections \u201cinvolves a substantial risk that physical force may be used against the victim in the course of committing the offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 905 (quoting <em>Ramsey v. INS, </em>55 F.3d 580, 583 (11th Cir.1995)). We held, therefore, that the defendant\u2019s prior conviction under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04 was properly considered a prior conviction for career offender purposes under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, regardless of which subsection of the Florida statute had been violated. <em>See id.; see also United States v. Ivory, </em>475 F.3d 1232, 1236-37 (11th Cir.2007) (\u201cAlternatively, and as an independent basis for our holding, we conclude that second degree rape of a minor, under Alabama law, at a minimum \u2018presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another,\u2019 as provided under \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2).\u201d).<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> We have already held, then, that an offense under Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04 presents a serious risk of physical injury to another. <em>Rutherford, </em>175 F.3d at 905; <em>see also Ivory, </em>475 F.3d at 1238 (emphasizing that \u201csexual offenses against minors always present \u2018a substantial risk that physical force will be used to ensure a child\u2019s compliance with an adult\u2019s sexual demands,\u2019 and that \u2018physical injury need not be certain for a crime to pose a serious risk of physical injury (quotation marks and alteration omitted) (quoting <em>United States v. Searcy, </em>418 F.3d 1193, 1197 (11th Cir.2005))); <em>see also United States v.

All of this leads us to conclude that sexual battery of a child under sixteen in violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04(3) (1996) is a crime that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1256-10\">That would seem to be the end of the matter, but it is not. We must also decide if a violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04(3) (1996) is a crime \u201croughly similar, in kind as well as in degree of risk posed\u201d to burglary, arson, extortion, and crimes involving the use of explosives. <em>Begay, </em>553 U.S. at 143, 128 S.Ct. at 1585; <em>see also United States v. Harrison, </em>558 F.3d 1280, 1295 (11th Cir.2009) (\u201cTo be sure, the Supreme Court [in Begay] did not interpret the text of \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) as written, but rather infused a \u2018similar in kind\u2019 requirement onto it.\u201d). The <em>Begay </em>Court concluded that DUI is different from the enumerated crimes of burglary, arson, extortion, and crimes involving the use of explosives, which \u201ctypically involve purposeful, \u2018violent,\u2019 and \u2018aggressive\u2019 conduct.\u201d <em>Begay, </em>553 U.S. at 144-45, 128 S.Ct. at 1586. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1231\">*1231</page-number>Court reasoned that DUI statutes, like the one it was considering, \u201ctypically do not insist on purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct; rather, they are, or are most nearly comparable to, crimes that impose strict liability, criminalizing conduct in respect to which the offender need not have had any criminal intent at all.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 145, 128 S.Ct. at 1586.</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-5\">The Supreme Court explained that arson, burglary, extortion, or crimes involving the use of explosives \u201care associated with a likelihood of future violent, aggressive, and purposeful \u2018armed career criminal\u2019 behavior in a way that\u201d strict liability crimes are not. <em>Id. </em>at 148, 128 S.Ct. at 1588; <em>see also Chambers v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 687, 692, 172 L.Ed.2d 484 (2009) (holding that failure to report to a penal institution is a crime that \u201camounts to a form of inaction, a far cry from the purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct potentially at issue when an offender uses explosives against property, commits arson, burgles a dwelling or residence, or engages in certain forms of extortion\u201d (quotation marks omitted)). Despite what the plain language of the ACCA\u2019s residual clause might imply, the Supreme Court has concluded that it \u201ccovers only <em>similar </em>crimes\u201d to the ones that are listed, \u201crather than <em>every </em>crime that \u2018presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u2019 \u201d <em>Begay, </em>553 U.S. at 142, 128 S.Ct. at 1585 (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-8\">Picking up on the <em>Begay </em>yarn, Harris weaves the argument that his crime of sexual battery of a child under the age of sixteen is a strict liability crime with no <em>mens rea </em>requirement, just like the DUI crime in <em>Begay. </em>The government is unable to dispute that. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04; <em>State v. Sorakrai, </em>543 So.2d 294, 295 (Fla. 2d DCA 1989) (\u201cIt is our judgment that conduct violative of section 800.04 carries with it the same concept of \u2018strict liability\u2019 that has traditionally characterized \u2018statutory rape.\u2019 Thus, we are persuaded that section 794.021 forecloses [the defendant] from a defense based upon the victim\u2019s misrepresentation of her age or a bona fide belief that she was sixteen years or older.\u201d); <em>Linehan v. State, </em>442 So.2d 244, 247 (Fla. 2d DCA 1983) (\u201c[T]here are three broad categories of crimes: (1) \u2018strict liability\u2019 crimes (e.g., DWI manslaughter or statutory rape) which are criminal violations even if done without intent to do the prohibited act; (2) general intent crimes; and (3) specific intent crimes.\u201d (citation omitted)); <em>see also Feliciano v. State, </em>937 So.2d 818, 820 (Fla. 1st DCA 2006) (explaining that since the nineteenth century, \u201cFlorida has recognized statutory rape as a strict liability crime.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1257-10\">Instead, the government stakes its position on the proposition that sexual battery of a child under sixteen is a strict liability offense that is different in kind from DUI offenses because it always involves a victim and always involves a perpetrator who is older and more mature than his victim and typically larger and stronger, as well. The government argues that the deliberate commission of a sexual battery on a child under the age of sixteen indicates a likelihood that the perpetrator might deliberately harm others, which is the type of crime that the ACCA is designed to address. <em>See Begay, </em>553 U.S. at 146, 128 S.Ct. at 1587 (reasoning that, unlike strict liability offenders, felons in possession of firearms who have committed earlier \u201ccrimes involving intentional or purposeful conduct\u201d have a criminal history that \u201cshow[s] an increased likelihood that the offender is the kind of person who might deliberately point the gun and pull the trigger\u201d). The problem with the government\u2019s argument is that the <em>Begay </em>Court did not make distinctions among different kinds of strict liability offenses. <em>See id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1232\">*1232</page-number>Instead, it held that because strict liability-crimes generally do not \u201cinsist on purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct\u201d and can be committed without \u201cany criminal intent at all,\u201d they are not violent felonies for purposes of the residual clause. <em>Id. </em>at 145, 128 S.Ct. at 1586-87.</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-4\">We have not addressed the issue of how <em>Begay </em>applies to the crime of sexual battery of a child under the age of sixteen. Some other courts of appeals, however, have held that under <em>Begay </em>strict liability offenses involving sexual acts with minors are not violent crimes under the ACCA\u2019s residual clause or the identically worded residual clause in the career offender guideline definition, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2. <em>See United States v. McDonald, </em>592 F.3d 808, 813-15 (7th Cir.2010) (holding that violation of Wisconsin statute providing that \u201c[w]hoever has sexual contact or sexual intercourse with a person who has not attained the age of 16 years is guilty of a Class C felony\u201d is not a crime of violence under the residual clause in the career offender guideline definition); <em>United States v. Thornton, </em>554 F.3d 443, 444, 449 (4th Cir.2009) (holding that a violation of \u201cVirginia\u2019s statutory rape offense, which makes it a crime to \u2018carnally know, without the use of force, a child\u2019 between thirteen and fifteen years of age\u201d is not a violent felony under the ACCA\u2019s residual clause (alteration omitted)); <em>United States v. Christensen, </em>559 F.3d 1092, 1093-94 (9th Cir.2009) (holding that a violation of the Washington statute providing that \u201c[a] person is guilty of rape of a child in the third degree when the person has sexual intercourse with another who is at least fourteen years old but less than sixteen years old and not married to the perpetrator and the perpetrator is at least forty-eight months older than the victim\u201d is not a violent felony under the ACCA\u2019s residual clause). <em>But see United States v. Daye, </em>571 F.3d 225, 233-34 (2d Cir.2009) (holding without much explanation that even though the Vermont statute making it a felony to \u201cengage[ ] in a sexual act\u201d with a person under the age of sixteen is a strict liability crime, it still \u201cinvolves deliberate and affirmative conduct,\u2019\u201d which meets <em>Be-gay\u2019s </em>requirements for violent felonies under the ACCA\u2019s residual clause). The Seventh Circuit has concluded that \u201c[b]y including only crimes that require \u2018purposeful\u2019 conduct, <em>Begay </em>has removed strict-liability crimes from the reach of the residual clause of the ACCA\u2019s definition of violent felony.\u201d <em>McDonald, </em>592 F.3d at 814.</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-6\">The difficulty in the present case lies in the fact that the Florida statute at issue covers a wide array of conduct. It is true that, as Harris' asserts, Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04(3) \u201cimpose[s] strict liability, criminalizing conduct in respect to which the offender need not have had any criminal intent at all.\u201d <em>Begay, </em>553 U.S. at 145, 128 S.Ct. at 1586-87; <em>see also id. </em>at 146, 128 S.Ct. at 1587 (\u201c[C]rimes involving intentional or purposeful conduct (as in burglary and arson) are different [from] DUI, a strict liability crime.\u201d). The Florida statute, however, also covers conduct that is undoubtedly intentional or purposeful. The statute provides no lower limit on the age of the victim, so it encompasses crimes for which no mistake about age could possibly be asserted by the perpetrator (even if mistake were a viable defense, which it is not); it covers, for example, sexual contact with a six-year-old child.</p>\n<p id=\"b1258-7\">Regardless of the range of conduct covered by the statute, we have been instructed to take a categorical approach, so that \u201c[i]n determining whether this crime is a violent felony, we consider the offense generically, that is to say, we examine it in terms of how the law defines the offense and not in terms of how an individual offender might have committed it on a particular occasion.\u201d <em>Begay, </em>553 U.S. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1233\">*1233</page-number>141, 128 S.Ct. at 1584; <em>see also Chambers, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. at 690 (explaining that courts should consider a crime in the generic sense or \u201ca crime as generally committed\u201d); <em>James, </em>550 U.S. at 202, 127 S.Ct. at 1594. Because the Florida statute, viewed categorically, imposes strict liability and covers such a broad range of conduct, we cannot say that a violation of it typically involves \u201cpurposeful, \u2018violent,\u2019 and \u2018aggressive\u2019 conduct,\u201d <em>Begay, </em>553 U.S. at 144-45, 128 S.Ct. at 1586. For that reason, we conclude that a violation of Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04(3)(1996) generally \u2014 without further specifics \u2014 is not a crime of violence under the ACCA\u2019s residual clause. Harris\u2019 sentence must be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b1259-7\">The convictions in this ease are AFFIRMED, but the sentence is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED to the district court for re-sentencing consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1250-7\">. The Court emphasized that in cases like Johnson\u2019s, where the statutory language does not unambiguously establish whether the underlying crime of conviction involved violent force, it is still permissible to look to the record of the conviction to determine if violent force was an element of the underlying crime:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1250-8\">When the law under which the defendant has been convicted contains statutory phrases that cover several different generic crimes, some of which require violent force and some of which do not, the \" 'modified categorical approach\u2019 \u201d that we have approved, <em>Nijhawan v. Holder, </em>557 U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 2294, 2302, 174 L.Ed.2d 22 (2009), permits a court to determine which statutory phrase was the basis for the conviction by consulting the trial record \u2014 including charging documents, plea agreements, transcripts of plea colloquies, findings of fact and conclusions of law from a bench trial, and jury instructions and verdict forms.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1250-17\">130 S.Ct. at 1273. Doing that did not help in the <em>Johnson </em>case, however, because the record did not reveal which alternative means of committing the offense had been the basis for conviction. <em>See id. </em>at 1269.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1251-8\">. The relevant statutory <em>provision has </em>since been rewritten and renumbered. <em>See </em>Fla. Stat. \u00a7 800.04(4) (2008). We cite here to the 1996 <em>version of </em>the statute, under which Harris was convicted.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1252-7\">. The Florida statute on which Harris' conviction was based could be violated by the \"union with ... the sexual organ of another,\u201d and under Florida law union means contact. <em>See Dorch v. State, </em>458 So.2d 357, 358 (Fla. 1st DCA 1984) (\"In this context it is clear that the Legislature intended that union\u2019 mean something other than penetration. We agree with the trial court that contact alone, between the sexual organ of the offender and the mouth, anus, or vagina of the victim, is sufficient to convict.\u201d). Harris\u2019 position is that because the statute could be violated by mere contact, a conviction under it, without more, is not enough to constitute a violent felony for ACCA purposes under \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i). The government does not disagree.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1252-8\">. The last time around our only observation related to the residual clause was this:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1252-11\">Harris\u2019 arguments based on <em>Begay v. United States, </em>553 U.S. 137, 128 S.Ct. 1581, 170 L.Ed.2d 490 (2008) are not relevant because <em>Begay </em>explicitly addressed only \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(ii) (any felony that \"is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\u201d), not \u00a7 924(e)(2)(B)(i) (any felony that \"has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\u201d). Thus, the Supreme Court's holding that DUI was not a violent felony under clause (ii) has no bearing on whether statutory rape is a violent felony under clause (i).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1252-12\"><em>Harris, </em>305 Fed.App'x at 556 n. 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1253-8\">.
