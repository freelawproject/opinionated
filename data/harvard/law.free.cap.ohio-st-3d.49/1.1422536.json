The <em>Loudermill </em>court held generally that \u201cthe pretermination \u2018hearing,\u2019 though necessary, need not be elab<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>orate\u201d and that \u201c* * * \u2018something less\u2019 than a full evidentiary hearing is sufficient prior to adverse administrative action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 545. More specifically, the <em>Loudermill </em>court set forth the basic requirements as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b59-5\">\u201cThe essential requirements of due process, and all that respondents seek or the Court of Appeals required, are notice and an opportunity to respond. The opportunity to present reasons, either in person or in writing, why proposed action should not be taken is a fundamental due process requirement. * * * [Citation omitted.] The tenured public employee is entitled to oral or written notice of the charges against him, an explanation of the employer\u2019s evidence, and an opportunity to present his side of the story. * * * [Citation omitted.] To require more than this prior to termination would intrude to an unwarranted extent on the government\u2019s interest in quickly removing an unsatisfactory employee.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 546.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-6\">Upon remand of the matter in <em>Loudermill, </em>the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, in affirming the decision of the district court, further clarified the process due an employee in such a pretermination hearing, as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b59-7\">\u201cThe applicable substantive law is settled. It is clearly established that Loudermill, as a tenured public employee, was entitled to a pretermination hearing. <em>Cleveland Board of Edn. </em>v. <em>Loudermill, </em>470 U.S. 532, 545, 105 S. Ct. 1487, 1495, 84 L. Ed. 2d 494 (1985). Such a hearing, <em>though necessary, </em>\u2018need not be elaborate.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>In fact, the employee is <em>only </em>entitled to:</p>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">\u201c \u2018[i] oral or written notice of the charges against him;</p>\n<p id=\"b59-9\">\u201c \u2018[ii] an explanation of the employer\u2019s evidence; and</p>\n<p id=\"b59-10\">\u201c \u2018[iii] an opportunity to present his side of the story.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>470 U.S. at 546, 105 S. Ct. at 1495.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-12\">\u201cIn this case, an onerous burden is not placed upon the employer by these requirements. Indeed, the Supreme Court has stated that where state law provides for a full administrative post-termination hearing and judicial review, the pretermination hearing:</p>\n<p id=\"b59-13\">\u201c[\u2018jneed not definitively resolve the propriety of the discharge. It should be an initial check against mistaken decisions \u2014 essentially, a determination of whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that the charges against the employee are true and support the proposed action.[\u2019]</p>\n<p id=\"b59-14\"><em>\u201cId. </em>at 545-46, 105 S. Ct. at 1495. The Supreme Court, in <em>Loudermill, </em>held that to require more than this \u2018prior to termination would intrude to an unwarranted extent on the government\u2019s interest in quickly removing an unsatisfactory employee.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 546, 105 S. Ct. at 1495.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-16\"><em>((* </em>* *</p>\n<p id=\"b59-17\">\u201c* * * Indeed, courts construing the Supreme Court\u2019s language in <em>Loudermill </em>have required only the barest of a pretermination procedure, especially when an elaborate post-termination procedure is in place * * *.\u201d <em>Loudermill </em>v. <em>Cleveland Bd. of Edn. </em>(C.A. 6, 1988), 844 F. 2d 304, 310-312.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-18\">As noted by the Supreme Court in <em>Loudermill, </em>the purpose of the constitutionally required pretermination hearing is not to definitively resolve the factual or legal issues involved in a termination. Rather, it is simply \u201can initial check against mistaken decisions \u2014 essentially, a determination of whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that the charges against the employee are true and support the proposed action * * *.\u201d <em>Cleveland Bd. of Edn. </em>v. <em>Loudermill, supra, </em>at 545-546. The court in arriving at its determina<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>tion set forth that a consideration of all aspects of any hearing rights afforded by the employer to the employee by state law must be balanced as to the due process afforded. The court stated: \u201cWe have pointed out that \u2018[t]he formality and procedural requisition for the hiring can vary, depending upon the importance of the interests involved and the nature of the subsequent proceedings.\u2019 * * * Under state law, respondents were later entitled to a full administrative hearing and judicial review * * *. Our holding rests in part on the provisions in Ohio law for a full post-termination hearing.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Just as the Supreme Court in <em>Loudermill </em>looked to the determinative law in Ohio at that time regarding due process hearing rights, we must also look to the current law in Ohio regarding such pretermination hearing rights. In addition to those rights still available in R.C. Chapter 124, R.C. 4117.10(A) provides, in pertinent part, that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-4\">\u201cAn agreement between a public employer and an exclusive representative entered into pursuant to Chapter 4117. of the Revised Code governs the wages, hours, and terms and conditions of public employment covered by the agreement. If the agreement provides for a final and binding arbitration of grievances, public employers, employees, and employee organizations are subject solely to that grievance procedure and the state personnel board of review or civil service commissions have no jurisdiction to receive and determine any appeals relating to matters that were the subject of a final and binding grievance procedure * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-8\">Here, there are collective bargaining agreements entered into between the representatives of the employees, Local 4501, and the Ohio State University. Such agreements in Articles 8 through 11 outline the grievance and arbitration procedures afforded the employees covered by the agreements.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In essence such provisions provide full post-termination hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>rights to the plaintiff employees through impartial binding arbitration. Thus, it is the arbitration hearing, not the pretermination hearing, that is the equivalent of the State Personnel Board of Review hearing. As provided by the agreements between the parties, a record of the arbitration hearing is allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">We agree with the conclusion of the court of appeals that, \u201c[accordingly, there is no compelling necessity for preserving the evidence received at the pretermination hearing since a full <em>de novo </em>hearing is afforded either by binding arbitration pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement or by appeal to the State Personnel Board of Review whichever may be applicable.\u201d We hold that a classified civil service <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>employee of the state of Ohio must be afforded a pretermination disciplinary hearing; however, such hearing need not be elaborate, but must afford the employee the opportunity to have an explanation of the employer\u2019s charges and evidence against him, and an opportunity to present his side of the story. <em>Cleveland Bd. of Edn. </em>v. <em>Loudermill, supra, </em>applied and followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">However, as found by the trial court and the court of appeals, we also hold that a classified civil service employee of the state of Ohio does not have a constitutional due process right to have a stenographic record or tape recording made of a pretermination hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">The court of common pleas properly granted summary judgment in this case, and the court of appeals properly affirmed, on the basis that there exists no constitutional right to preserve evidence at a pretermination hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b62-8\">Moyer, C.J., Wright, H.
