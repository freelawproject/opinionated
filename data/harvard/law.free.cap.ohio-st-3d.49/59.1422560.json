See definitions of \u201cagency\u201d and \u201cadjudication\u201d in R.C. 119.01(A) and (D); and 1981 Ohio Atty. Gen. Ops. No. 81-014, at 2-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-14\">Under Ohio law, the board is charged with licensing and regulating psychologists, with authority to reprimand, or to suspend or revoke their licenses. The board investigates suspected misconduct and rule violations. See R.C. 4732.06 and 4732.17.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-15\">We find that at least one or both of the secondary requirements under R.C. 149.43(A)(2)(a) or (b) also exist. Release of the record creates a high probability of disclosure of uncharged suspects or informants to \u201cwhom confidentiality has been reasonably promised.\u201d Decisions to delay or not file charges do not override the confidential law enforcement investigatory exception. <em>State, ex rel. Thompson Newspapers, Inc., </em>v. <em>Martin </em>(1989), 47 Ohio St. 3d 28, 546 N.E. 2d 939.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-16\">' Under the specific facts of this case, we are satisfied that an <em>in camera </em>inspection is not required. But, see, <em>State, ex rel. Outlet Communications, Inc., </em>v. <em>Lancaster Police Dept. </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St. 3d 324, 528 N.E. 2d 175; <em>State, ex rel. Fostoria Daily Review Co., </em>v. <em>Fostoria Hosp. Assn. </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St. 3d 10, 531 N.E. 2d 313. The identity of uncharged suspects and confidential witnesses or information sources would necessarily be intertwined with any retained investigatory records.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-17\">This material may also qualify as an exempt \u201ctrial preparation record,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>under R.C. 149.43(A)(4), an issue not briefed here. When the board\u2019s investigator briefed the Attorney-General\u2019s office in June 1989, criminal proceedings for alleged Medicaid fraud may reasonably have been anticipated. But, see, <em>Barton </em>v. <em>Shupe </em>(1988), 37 Ohio St. 3d 308, 525 N.E. 2d 812.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">We also note McGee has alternative remedies available to him in connection with any criminal investigation. See <em>State, ex rel. Scanlon, </em>v. <em>Deters </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St. 3d 376, 544 N.E. 2d 680. Trial courts are fully able to decide R.C. 149.43 issues in any discovery process. <em>Henneman </em>v. <em>Toledo </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St. 3d 241, 520 N.E. 2d 207.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">For the above-stated reasons, the writ of mandamus is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-9\">\n<em>Writ denied.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b117-10\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Wright, H.
