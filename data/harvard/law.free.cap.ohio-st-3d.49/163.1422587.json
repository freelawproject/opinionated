The dissolution of a corporation shall not discharge an officer\u2019s * * * liability for a prior failure of the corporation to * * * remit tax due. The sum due for such liability may be collected by assessment in the manner provided in section 5739.13 of the Revised Code.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-19\">Under this statute, a corporation\u2019s failure to remit sales tax due to the state creates personal liability in the responsible corporate officers to make such payments and that liability may be collected by an assessment against the officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-20\">The statute is specific and unambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-21\">R.C. 5739.03 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-22\">\u201c* * * [E]ach vendor shall collect from the consumer, as a trustee for the state of Ohio, the full and exact amount of the tax payable on each taxable sale * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-23\">R.C. 5739.29 states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b219-24\">\u201cNo vendor shall fail to collect the full and exact tax as required by sections 5739.01 to 5739.31, inclusive * * * &gt;&gt;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b219-26\">R.C. 5739.13, as applicable, concludes the applicable scheme of taxation and liability, as follows: \u201cIf any vendor collects the tax imposed * * * and fails to remit the same to the state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>* * *, he shall be personally liable for any amount collected which he failed to remit. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">\u201cIf any vendor fails to collect the tax * * * on any transaction subject to the tax, such vendor * * * shall be personally liable for the amount of the tax * * * <em>&gt;&gt;</em></p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">These statutes describe the nature and extent of sales tax which is <em>due </em>to the state. Included within the scope of tax <em>due </em>is tax which has been collected, as well as the liability of the vendor to pay the tax even though it has not been collected. The vendor is clearly charged with personal responsibility to collect all applicable taxes and his or her failure results in personal liability for the tax, the sum of which can be assessed against the vendor under R.C. 5739.13. As previously stated, R.C. 5739.33 authorizes a shifting of tax liability to responsible corporate officers. The parties have stipulated that the vendor in this case is a corporation and that appellants are responsible officers of the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">Appellants\u2019 reliance on their definition of \u201cremit\u201d is fruitless in the context of its use in these tax statutes. It is true that one of the definitions found in Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary (2 Ed. 1956) 2107, is \u201c4. [t]o send back * * but that construction is pointless in construing the term in the applicable statute. The reference in R.C. 5739.33 is to \u201cremit tax due to the state.\u201d The more acceptable definition from Webster\u2019s, <em>supra, </em>is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-8\">\u201c9. * * * [t]o transmit or send * * * in payment of a demand, account, draft, * * *.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-10\">More significant is the definition of \u201cdue.\u201d Webster\u2019s defines it as: \u201c1. [o]wed or owing as a debt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 796.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-11\">Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (5 Ed. 1979) 448, is in accord:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-12\">\u201cJust; proper; regular; lawful; sufficient; reasonable, as in the phrases \u2018due care,\u2019 \u2018due process of law,\u2019 \u2018due notice.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b220-13\">\u201cOwing; payable; justly owed. That which one contracts to pay or perform to another; that which law or justice requires to be paid or done.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b220-14\">Finally, the word \u201ccollected,\u201d referenced in R.C. 5739.99(E) relative to the penally for failure to remit to the state the tax collected, is not used in R.C. 5739.33 as a qualifier of the corporation\u2019s responsibility to remit tax due to the state. This court will give effect to the words used in a statute and will not insert words not used. <em>Wheeling Steel Corp. </em>v. <em>Porterfield </em>(1970), 24 Ohio St. 2d 24, 28, 53 O.O. 2d 13, 15, 263 N.E. 2d 249, 251.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-15\">It follows that appellants are liable for all tax due to the state, not merely the tax collected. <em>Rowland </em>v. <em>Collins </em>(1976), 48 Ohio St. 2d 311, 2 O.O. 3d 450, 358 N.E. 2d 582.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-16\">The decision of the Board of Tax Appeals being neither unreasonable nor unlawful is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-17\">\n<em>Decision affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b220-18\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas, Wright, H. Brown and Resnick, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
