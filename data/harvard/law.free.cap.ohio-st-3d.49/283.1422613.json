Jennings, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1983), 1 Ohio St. 3d 101, 1 OBR 135, 438 N.E. 2d 420. Firestone\u2019s argument is contingent upon that finding: If claimant did not engage in sustained remunerative employment, then no viable basis for opposing continued permanent total disability compensation exists.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This critical finding, however, is presently unreviewable since the commission\u2019s order does not identify the evidence upon which it relied on as required by <em>State, ex rel. Mitchell, </em>v. <em>Robbins &amp; Myers, Inc. </em>(1983), 6 Ohio St. 3d 481, 6 OBR 531, 453 N.E. 2d 721.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-7\">Firestone asserts that evidentiary review and identification are unnecessary since the parties \u201cagree\u201d that \u201csome evidence\u201d of sustained remunerative employment exists. This latter claim is based on claimant\u2019s failure to appeal the commission\u2019s order, which Firestone maintains is tantamount to an admission that \u201csome evidence\u201d is present. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-10\">The alleged agreement between the parties does not bar us from performing our review. Merely because the parties agree that \u201csome evidence\u201d exists does not make it so. In <em>State, ex rel. O.M. Scott &amp; Sons Co., </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1986), 28 Ohio St. 3d 341, 28 OBR 406, 503 N.E. 2d 1032, the parties\u2019 \u201cagreement\u201d that mandamus was the proper vehicle for relief did not preclude us from holding otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-11\">In the present case we cannot reach the merits of Firestone\u2019s abuse-of-discretion allegation without first finding \u201csome evidence\u201d of sustained remunerative employment. Being unable to do so, we remand this cause to the commission in accord with the appellate court\u2019s decision, including compliance with <em>Mitchell, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b340-12\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-13\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b340-14\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas, Wright, H. Brown and Resnick, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b340-8\"> In his appeal herein, claimant challenges the vacation of his right to continue to receive permanent total disability compensation after August 14, 1985. Claimant's argument also hinges, in part, upon the commission\u2019s finding.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
