Our review of the record leads us to a contrary conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-15\">There is no doubt that in this case either parent would be a fit person for custody of the child involved. A finding for either parent could be premised upon this record. Under R.C. 3109.04, the domestic relations court decides to whom the care, custody and control of a minor child shall be awarded, giving paramount consideration to the best interests of the child. See <em>Charles </em>v. <em>Charles </em>(1985), 23 Ohio App. 3d 109, 23 OBR 175, 491 N.E. 2d 378. In any determination of this nature, the trial court must consider all relevant factors, including but not limited to those enumerated in R.C. 3109.04(C)(1) through (5):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>\u201c(1) The wishes of the child\u2019s parents regarding his custody;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-4\">\u201c(2) The wishes of the child regarding his custody if he is eleven years of age or older;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-5\">\u201c(3) The child\u2019s interaction and interrelationship with his parents, siblings, and any other person who <em>may </em>significantly affect the child\u2019s best interest;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-6\">\u201c(4) The child\u2019s adjustment to his home, school, and community;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-7\">\u201c(5) The mental and physical health of all persons involved in the situation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">The court of appeals properly noted that in Ohio a trial court in forming a custody order should give due consideration to which parent performed the role as primary caregiver. However, the error here is the court of appeals\u2019 finding that the trial court did not properly consider this factor. In its findings of fact the trial court specifically noted that \u201c* * * the Plaintiff [Nancy Bechtol] provided services as a homemaker and child caretaker [caregiver] during the marriage. * * *\u201d The trial court also noted that Nancy Bechtol did not work outside the home during the marriage and only recently had become employed.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-9\">The court of appeals found that it would be \u201c* * * ill advised and imprudent to disrupt the pattern to which the child has become accustomed.\u201d Even assuming this to be the case, this conclusion falls short of the oft-repeated test that a finding of abuse of discretion must imply a decision that is * * unreasonable, arbitrary or unconscionable.\u2019\u201d Blake<em>more </em>v. <em>Blakemore </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St. 3d 217, 219, 5 OBR 481, 482, 450 N.E. 2d 1140, 1142. See, also, <em>Trickey </em>v. <em>Trickey </em>(1952), 158 Ohio St. 9, 13-14, 47 O.O. 481, 483, 106 N.E. 2d 772, 774.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-11\">A careful review of the record in this case reveals competent, credible evidence to support the trial court\u2019s award of custody to Joseph Bechtol. Thus, we hold that where an award of custody is supported by a substantial amount of credible and competent evidence, such an award will not be reversed as being against the weight of the evidence by a reviewing court. We are mindful of our prior holding in <em>Trickey, supra, </em>at 13, 47 O.O. at 483, 106 N.E. 2d at 774, where we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-13\">\u201cIn proceedings involving the custody and welfare of children the power of the trial court to exercise discretion is peculiarly important. The knowledge obtained through contact with and observation of the parties and through independent investigation can not be conveyed to a reviewing court by the printed record.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-14\">Our review of the record reveals that evidence was presented on almost every factor found in R.C. 3109.04(C) for consideration by the trial court. Some of the factors were not disputed, but it is for the trial court to resolve disputes of fact and weigh the testimony and credibility of the witnesses. See <em>Pasqualone </em>v. <em>Pasqualone </em>(1980), 63 Ohio St. 2d 96, 17 O.O. 3d 58, 406 N.E. 2d 1121.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-15\">Much is made by appellant of the court of appeals\u2019 reference to the \u201ctender years\u201d doctrine in its opinion. The General Assembly has spoken on this issue through R.C. 3109.03 by indicating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-16\">\u201cWhen a husband and wife are living separate and apart from each other, or are divorced, and the question as to the care, custody, and control of their offspring is brought before a court of competent jurisdiction, they shall stand upon an equality as to the care, custody, and control of such offspring, so far as parenthood is involved.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b79-17\">We believe that trial courts in con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>sidering and weighing the issue of who is the primary caregiver will give due consideration to the state of an infant child in a controversy concerning custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">Appellant in his second proposition of law argues that the record does not support a need for sustenance alimony under R.C. 3105.18 and that the trial court abused its discretion in making such award. We agree with the court of appeals that the alimony award was not an abuse of discretion. Alimony is both needed and warranted here. A trial court has considerable but not unbridled discretion in fashioning sustenance alimony awards. See <em>Blakemore </em>v. <em>Blakemore, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">Accordingly, for the reasons aforesaid, the decision of the court of appeals is affirmed in part and reversed in part and the trial court\u2019s award of custody to Joseph Bechtol is reinstated.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b80-8\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas, H.
