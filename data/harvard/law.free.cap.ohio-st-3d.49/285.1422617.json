Code 4121-3-15(B)(3) and (8), an \u201cattending physician\u201d must complete any C-85-A. The workers\u2019 compensation statutes and the administrative rules, however, leave \u201cphysician\u201d undefined. Appellant submits that the Ohio Administrative Code interchanges \u201cphysician\u201d and \u201clicensed practitioner.\u201d Ohio Adm. Code 4121-17-03 includes \u201cmechanotherapist\u201d within the latter definition. Appellant thus contends that a mechanotherapist must be considered to be an \u201cattending physician.\u201d This argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-22\">Upon review, we are unconvinced that the Ohio Administrative Code uses \u201cphysician\u201d and \u201clicensed practitioner\u201d synonymously. More importantly, we note that Ohio Adm. Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>4731-1-02(E) specifically prohibits limited practitioners such as mechanotherapists from <em>ever </em>designating themselves as \u201cphysicians.\u201d See, also, Ohio Adm. Code 4731-1-01.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">Our Revised Code contains similar limitations. R.C. 1737.01(A) defines \u201clicensed physicians and surgeons\u201d as persons certified under R.C. 4731.14, which certification is limited to medical doctors and doctors of osteopathy. R.C. 1785.01(A) also differentiates between \u201cphysicians\u201d and \u201climited practitioners\u201d \u2014 a distinction we affirmed in <em>State </em>v. <em>DeMido </em>(1974), 37 Ohio St. 2d 125, 66 O.O. 2d 281, 308 N.E. 2d 749.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">In <em>DeMido, </em>defendant, a mechanotherapist, performed a client eye examination. When charged with practicing optometry without a license, defendant tried to invoke a statutory exemption that permitted physicians to examine eyes without an optometry license. We rejected this argument and ruled against defendant, concluding:</p>\n<p id=\"b342-7\">\u201cIn those sections of the Revised Code which define the terms \u2018physician\u2019 and \u2018surgeon,\u2019 the General Assembly has consistently referred to such terms as applying only to medical doctors and osteopaths. It has never included a limited practitioner, such as a mechanotherapist, as a physician or surgeon.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 127, 66 O.O. 2d at 282, 308 N.E. 2d at 751.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b342-10\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas, Wright, H. Brown and Resnick, JJ., concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
