For the following reasons, however, we find that evidentiary review cannot proceed at this time.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-17\">First, the commission failed to address the key question before it. Temporary-total-compensation eligibility is established where a claimant\u2019s allowed conditions cause a temporary disability that prevents a return to his former position of employment. <em>State, ex rel. Ramirez, </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1982), 69 Ohio St. 2d 630, 23 O.O. 3d 518, 433 N.E. 2d 586. In the present case, all agree that claimant is unable to return to his former job. The key question is whether this inability is due to the claimant\u2019s allowed conditions or to his other medical problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-18\">The commission\u2019s order does not address this critical issue. It merely confirms that a work-prohibitive disability exists. Without a clear commission statement on causal relationship, evidentiary review is impossible.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-19\">Second, our review is limited to that evidence specifically <em>relied </em>on by the commission. <em>State, ex rel. Mitchell, </em>v. <em>Robbins &amp; Myers, Inc. </em>(1984), 6 Ohio St. 3d 481, 6 OBR 531, 453 N.E. 2d 721. Under <em>Mitchell, </em>the commission must \u201cspecifically state which evidence and only that evidence which has been relied upon to reach [its] conclusion * * *.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 483-484, 6 OBR at 534, 453 N.E. 2d at 724. Here, the commission appears to have listed all the evidence <em>considered, </em>instead of narrowing its citation to the evidence on which it relied. This conclusion is suggested by the order\u2019s language and by simple logic \u2014 the commission could not have relied on both Dr. Sparks and Dr. Urban in concluding that claimant was temporarily and totally disabled due to the allowed conditions. It is thus unclear which of the doctors\u2019 reports are properly before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>On authority of <em>Mitchell </em>and <em>State, ex rel. Frigidaire Division, General Motors Corp., </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1988), 35 Ohio St. 3d 105, 518 N.E. 2d 1194, the appellate judgment is hereby reversed and a limited writ of mandamus is allowed directing the commission to issue an amended order: (1) addressing the causal relationship issue, and (2) listing only that evidence relied on to reach its conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and limited writ allowed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b149-7\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas, Wright, H.
