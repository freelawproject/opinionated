A leading scholar in this area of the law, Professor Larson, has noted that \u201c[t]he heart of every compensation act, and the source of most litigation in the compensation field, is the coverage formula. * * * Few groups of statutory words in the history of law have had to bear the weight of such a mountain of interpretation as has been heaped upon this slender foundation. * * *\u201d 1 Larson, The Law of Workmen\u2019s Compensation (1984) 3-1 to 3-3, Section 6.10.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-13\">In <em>Bralley </em>v. <em>Daugherty </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St. 2d 302, 15 O.O. 3d 359, 401 N.E. 2d 448, this court set forth the general rules applicable to the issue of coverage under the Ohio Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-14\">\u201cAn injury sustained by an employee is compensable under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act only if it was \u2018received in the course of, and arising out of, the injured employee\u2019s employment.\u2019 R.C. 4123.01(C); R.C. 4123.54; <em>Fassig </em>v. <em>State, ex rel. Turner </em>(1917), 95 Ohio St. 232.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-15\">\u201cThe test of the right to participate in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund is not whether there was any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>fault or neglect on the part of the employer or his employees, but whether a \u2018causal connection\u2019 existed between an employee\u2019s injury and his employment either through the activities, the conditions or the environment of the employment. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>v. <em>Weigandt </em>(1921), 102 Ohio St. 1; <em>Indus. Comm. </em>v. <em>Gintert </em>(1934), 128 Ohio St. 129; <em>Fox </em>v. <em>Schiele </em>(1955), 162 Ohio St. 569.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 303, 15 O.O. 3d at 360, 401 N.E. 2d at 449-450.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">One year after <em>Bralley, supra, </em>we refined the \u201carising out of\u201d element by considering the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d test for determining whether a causal connection existed between an employee\u2019s injury and his employment. In <em>Lord </em>v. <em>Daugherty </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St. 2d 441, 20 O.O. 3d 376, 423 N.E. 2d 96, we held at the syllabus:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-6\">\u201cWhether there is a sufficient \u2018causal connection\u2019 between an employee\u2019s injury and his employment to justify the right to participate in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Fund depends on the totality of the facts and circumstances surrounding the accident, including: (1) the proximity of the scene of the accident to the place of employment, (2) the degree of control the employer had over the scene of the accident, and (3) the benefit the employer received from the injured employee\u2019s presence at the scene of the accident.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">We now expressly recognize the conjunctive nature of the coverage formula of \u201cin the course of and arising out of\u201d the employment. Therefore, all elements of the formula must be met before compensation will be allowed.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">Traditionally, other jurisdictions have bifurcated the basic coverage formula but have required that both prongs exist. The \u201cin the course of\u201d prong is construed to relate to the time, place and circumstances of the injury, while the \u201carising out of\u201d prong is interpreted as referring to a causal connection between the employment and the injury. <em>Larson, supra, </em>at 3-3, Section 6.10. See, also, <em>State Comp. Ins. Fund </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1982), 133 Cal. App. 3d 643, 652, 184 Cal. Rptr. 111, 116.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">Likewise, other jurisdictions have adhered to the principle that each prong of the formula must therefore be satisfied before compensability will be allowed. <em>Maher </em>v. <em>Workers\u2019 Comp. Appeals Bd. </em>(1983), 33 Cal. 3d 729, 190 Cal. Rptr. 904, 661 P. 2d 1058; <em>Malacarne </em>v. <em>Yonkers Parking Auth. </em>(1976), 41 N.Y. 2d 189, 391 N.Y. Supp. 2d 402, 359 N.E. 2d 992; <em>Strother </em>v. <em>Morrison Cafeteria </em>(Fla. 1980), 383 So. 2d 623. \u201cThis two-pronged requirement is the cornerstone of the workers\u2019 compensation system.\u201d <em>Maher, supra, </em>at 732-733, 190 Cal. Rptr. at 905-906, 661 P. 2d at 1056-1060. In <em>Strother, </em>the Supreme Court of Florida embarked on a well-reasoned analysis as to whether that court had developed inconsistent constructions of the basic coverage formula, stating as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-11\">\u201cAlthough in several decisions, we have referred to the distinct and separate nature of the two elements of \u2018arising out of\u2019 and \u2018in the course of,\u2019 we have also, in other decisions, tended to merge these factors together into a test of work connectedness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 624-625. The court went on to hold that \u201cto be compensable, an injury must arise out of employment in the sense of causation and be in the course of employment in the sense of continuity of time, space, and circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 628.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-12\">Consistent with our decision and case law from other jurisdictions, we continue to interpret \u201cin the course\u201d to associate with the time, place and circumstances of the injury. The \u201caris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>ing out of\u201d element, as noted earlier, contemplates a causal connection between the injury and the employment. In <em>Lord, swpra, </em>we announced three distinct factors to aid in determining whether a sufficient causal relationship existed, based upon the totality of the facts and circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">In Ohio, as well as in other jurisdictions, it is well-established that workers\u2019 compensation statutes must be liberally construed in favor of the employee. R.C. 4123.95. Thus, it is axiomatic that the phrase \u201cin the course of, and arising out of\u201d must be accorded a liberal construction. \u201cIn applying it [the coverage formula], this court must be guided by the * * * fundamental principle that the requirement is to be liberally construed <em>in favor of awarding benefits.\u201d </em>(Emphasis <em>sic.) Maher, supra, </em>at 733, 190 Cal. Rptr. at 906, 661 P. 2d at 1060.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">We will now apply the appropriate analysis to the facts of the present case. Appellant was injured while she was going to her school, and approximately fifteen minutes before she was to begin work. Appellant\u2019s injury was sustained at another school within the same district where she is employed. Lastly, the school at which appellant taught was, as stipulated, \u201capproximately one to one-half miles\u201d from the school where the injury occurred. Therefore, it is clear that appellant was injured minutes before she was to begin work and at a place under the control of her employer. When considering the circumstances under which appellant was injured, we find appellant has sufficiently demonstrated that her injury was \u201cin the course of\u201d her employment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b334-9\">As noted earlier, whether appellant\u2019s injuries arose out of her employment is determined from the totality of the circumstances, using the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>factors set forth in <em>Lord, supra.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>The first factor examines the proximity of the scene of the accident to the place of employment. Because we have already concluded that appellant was injured on her employer\u2019s premises, appellant satisfies this factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">The second factor involves the degree of control the employer had over the scene of the accident. Appellees argue that the school board had no control over the voluntary actions of appellant in going to Kaiser Elementary School. However, the appellees misconstrue the analysis. The proper scrutiny entails the amount of control the employer had over the situs of the injury, and not the degree of control the employer had regarding the actions of its employees. In this respect, we find that the degree of control the employer had over the scene of the accident was at its apex. Clearly, it cannot be denied that the school board had complete control over the steps leading to and from one of its own schools, hence appellant has also satisfied the second factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-6\">The third factor announced in <em>Lord </em>explores the benefit to the employer. In <em>Kohlmayer </em>v. <em>Keller </em>(1970), 24 Ohio St. 2d 10, 12, 53 O.O. 2d 6, 7, 263 N.E. 2d 231, 233, we noted the benefits received by an employer when sponsoring purely social events. These benefits included a more harmonious working atmosphere, better job service and greater job interest. Likewise, we find a benefit in the heightened morale that naturally flows from the flower fund involved in the present case. This court is not alone in recognizing these types of benefits to an employer. See 1A Larson, <em>supra, </em>at 5-148, Section 22.30. Consequently, appellant has established the third factor as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-9\">When considering the totality of the facts and circumstances of this case, we find that the test set forth in <em>Lord, supra, </em>has been met. Thus, appellant has shown a sufficient causal connection between the injury and her employment to warrant a conclusion that the injury arose out of her employment. Likewise, appellant has demonstrated that her injury occurred while she was in the course of her employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-10\">The present case is a factually stronger case than many from other jurisdictions. See <em>Warthen </em>v. <em>Southeast Oklahoma State Univ. </em>(Okla. App. 1981), 641 P. 2d 1125 (death of teacher from heart attack on basketball court after he was requested to referee a game); <em>Heinz </em>v. <em>Concord Union School Dist. </em>(1977), 117 N.H. 214, 371 A. 2d 1161 (death of teacher in motorcycle accident after leaving home of a fellow teacher, where he had attended a party, consumed alcoholic beverages and was on his way home to change clothes and pick up his wife to chaperone a school dance); <em>Horvath </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1915), 26 Wis. 2d 253, 131 N.W. 2d 876 (teacher injured in accident on her way home to bathe and change clothes to return to Future Homemakers of America Banquet). All these teachers were found to be engaged in an activity \u201cin the course of, and arising out of\u201d their employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-11\">Appellant herein was on her way to her place of employment when the injury occurred at Kaiser Elementary, another school over which the school board had control. Furthermore, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>flower fund had been in existence for a considerable period of time before appellant was injured. In this sense, the employer was well aware of the fund, and indeed fully acquiesced to its perpetuation. The assertion that the fund was customary is well-founded in both fact and reason.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">We note that when applying the analysis set forth above, a reviewing court must examine the separate and distinct facts of each case. Historically, similar fact patterns have promulgated their own set of rules. For example, the recreational activity cases have developed a unique group of tests, as well as the so-called \u201ccoming and going\u201d cases. Professor Larson\u2019s treatise on workers\u2019 compensation categorizes the cases in his discussion as to the fact patterns involved. This is because workers\u2019 compensation cases are, to a large extent, very fact specific. As such, no one test or analysis can be said to apply to each and every factual possibility. Nor can only one factor be considered controlling. Rather, a flexible and analytically sound approach to these cases is preferable. Otherwise, the application of hard and fast rules can lead to unsound and unfair results.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">Considering the above cases and our discussion of the appropriate analysis, to deny benefits to appellant in this case would lead to an inconsistent result. Therefore, the trial court erred in granting appellees\u2019 motion for summary judgment, and in denying appellant\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The judgment of the court of appeals is reversed and this cause is remanded to the trial court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-6\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b336-7\">Sweeney, Douglas, Wright and H.

Graphite Bronze Co. </em>(1947), 148 Ohio St. 693, 36 O.O. 282, 76 N.E. 2d 892, we stated at the third paragraph of the syllabus that \u201c[t]o be entitled to workmen\u2019s compensation, a workman need not necessarily be injured in the actual performance of work for his employer. It is sufficient if he is injured in a pursuit or undertaking consistent with his contract of hire and which in some logical manner pertains to or is incidental to his employment.\u201d Justice Zimmerman, writing for a unanimous court, cited the following cases as applying this rule: <em>\u201cDeCamp </em>v. <em>Youngstown Municipal Ry.

I respectfully dissent from the majority opinion in this case which permits the employee to participate in the State Insurance Fund after being injured while collecting money for a flower fund at a location outside her fixed site of employment, and before normal working hours.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-10\">In order for appellant to establish \u25a0 a compensable injury she must show that it occurred in the course of and arising out of her employment with the Champion Local Board of Education. See <em>Ashbrook </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1939), 136 Ohio St. 115, 16 O.O. 42, 24 N.E. 2d 33; R.C. 4123.01(C). At present, a dual statutory requirement exists which states that an injury, in order to be compensable, must not only occur \u201cin the course of * * * the * * * employment,\u201d but also \u201caris[e] out of * * * the * * * employment.\u201d These requirements flow from separate sources: the former requirement is constitutionally mandated in Section 35, Article II of the Ohio Constitution; while the latter is of judicial origin, which has been subsequently codified. One of the foremost published scholars on the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, James Young, in his treatise, Workmen\u2019s Compensation Law of Ohio (2 Ed. 1971) 75, Section 5.3, points out that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-11\">\u201cIn determining course of employment, the fundamental concern is the activity of the employee at the time of the injury. Is he doing something for his employer or for himself or another? That concern subdivides into constituent factors:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-12\">\u201ca. the fact of payment or the expectation of payment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-13\">\u201cb. the source of payment;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b336-14\">\u201cc. control over the activity and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>by whom it is exercised, a most important factor;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-5\">\u201cd. the situs of the employment, which may be fixed, semi-fixed or variable;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-6\">\u201ce. the situs of the accident;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-7\">\u201cf. a major factor is time, and there the time of the injury and the time of employment are both significant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-8\">In ascertaining whether an employee\u2019s action is in the course of employment we have focused on whether the employee was performing the obligation of his or her contract of employment. See <em>Indus. Comm. </em>v. <em>Davison </em>(1928), 118 Ohio St. 180, 160 N.E. 693, paragraph two of the syllabus. An employee has been held to be within the course of his employment when he does such things which are usually and reasonably incidental to the work of his employer, including taking refreshments, rest and smoking. See <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1920), 13 Ohio App, 262, 31 Ohio C.C. (N.S.) 390; see, also, <em>Sebek </em>v. <em>Cleveland Graphite Bronze Co. </em>(1947), 148 Ohio St. 693, 36 O.O. 282, 76 N.E. 2d 892 (where a meal is part of the employee\u2019s compensation an injury resulting from the eating of the meal was considered reasonably incidental to the duties of the contract). The determination of whether an activity is in the course of employment has often been combined with the element of arising out of the employment. The latter is said to be the causal connection of the employment to the injury. See <em>Bralley </em>v. <em>Daugherty </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St. 2d 302, 15 O.O. 3d 359, 401 N.E. 2d 448.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">In deciding whether an employee\u2019s conduct is in the course of employment and arises out of the employment, the focus should be on the zone of employment and the benefit the employer has received through the conduct of the employee. The \u201cbenefit to the employer\u201d analysis is generally utilized where the employee\u2019s conduct is outside a certain zone of employment. Specifically, where an accident occurs outside an identified zone of employment, the inquiry should include the nature of the employee\u2019s activity and its nexus to the actual duties of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-11\">In reviewing the dual statutory requirement for establishing a compensable injury, this court in <em>Lord </em>v. <em>Daugherty </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St. 2d 441, 20 O.O. 3d 376, 423 N.E. 2d 96, addressed the issue of whether there was a sufficient causal connection to justify the injured party\u2019s right to participate in the State Insurance Fund by focusing upon the totality of the facts and circumstances regarding the accident. Such circumstances included:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b337-12\">\u201c* * * (1) the proximity of the scene of the accident to the place of employment, (2) the degree of control the employer had over the scene of the accident, and (3) the benefit the employer received from the injured employee\u2019s presence at the scene of the accident.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at syllabus.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b337-13\">In applying the factors enunciated in <em>Lord </em>to the case <em>subjudice, </em>it is clear that appellant\u2019s accident was not in the course of or arising out of her employment. The accident occurred \u201cone to one-half miles\u201d from appellant\u2019s fixed site of employment. The only reason the employer had control over the place where appellant was injured was because Kaiser Elementary was one of the schools in the district. However, appellant had never worked at Kaiser before and went there of her own volition prior to normal working hours. The employer had no control over appellant\u2019s voluntary act of going to a different school where she had never been employed. The appellant had no reason to be at Kaiser except as a personal venture, <em>i.e., </em>to collect for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>flower fund. The school board did not receive any benefit from appellant\u2019s presence at Kaiser. The school board had no direct participation or involvement in the flower fund, in that it did not sponsor or oversee the operation of the fund. Appellant\u2019s occupation was the business of instructing and supervising students at Central Elementary. It ,is possible that by picking up supplies or material for the purpose of instructing and supervising students a benefit wou\u00edd have been conferred on the employer, but such was not the case here. Rather, the action of appellant in the instant case was a benevolent gesture directed by a teacher for teachers. It had nothing to do with the business of educating students.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">Appellant, along with <em>amicus curiae </em>United Auto Workers, asserts that because the school board was aware of the flower fund and that certain members of management were voluntary participants in it, the school board recognized and sanctioned the flower fund as a custom incidental to employment. However, in reviewing the authority cited by appellant and <em>amicus </em>for their position, I find instances of <em>active </em>participation by the employer through paid breaks, permission to use equipment, sponsoring social outings and the providing of a final paycheck. None of the above activities involved merely the awareness of the employer of some course of action by the employee. Instead, the employer actively participated and consented to the activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">Appellant and <em>amicus </em>United Auto Workers also contend that the school board received a business-related benefit from the existence of the flower fund in terms of increased morale through a greater sense of teamwork, which resulted in improved relations with the administration. Moreover, it is asserted that an employee is not required to actively perform his or her assigned duties as long as he or she is doing an activity consistent with the employment contract. In reviewing our previous decisions on this issue, it is clear that there must be some significant involvement or participation by the employer relative to employee work or non-work-related activities, in order for the employer to obtain a significant business-related benefit. Essentially, to be entitled to workers\u2019 compensation an employee need not be injured in the actual performance of work for his or her employer. It is sufficient if he or she is injured in a pursuit or undertaking consistent with his or her contract for hire and which in some logical manner pertains to or is incidental to his or her employment. See <em>Sebek, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">The majority cites <em>Kohlmayer </em>v. <em>Keller </em>(1970), 24 Ohio St. 2d 10, 12, 53 O.O. 2d 6, 7, 263 N.E. 2d 231, 233, for an illustration of benefits received by an employer when sponsoring purely social events. However, <em>Kohlmayer </em>is distinguishable from the instant case. In <em>Kohlmayer, </em>an employee was injured at a company picnic. The picnic was sponsored, paid for and supervised by the employer for the purpose of generating friendly relations. Obviously, the majority fails to observe that in the present case, the school board did not sponsor or supervise it, nor was it affiliated with the flower fund.
