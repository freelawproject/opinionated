The letter stated, in part: \u201cAfter reading the [petitioner\u2019s] brief, it appears that, due to the confusing state of the record in this case, I may have simply missed the fact that the petitioner attempted to raise various incompetency claims in his latest pro se petition. I therefore would have some willingness to sign a postjudgment order granting the petitioner a habeas trial on these claims.\u201d On the basis of the contents of this letter, which this court appreciates, we conclude that the matter should be remanded for further proceedings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b464-8\"> Practice Book \u00a7 23-29 provides in relevant part: \u201cThe judicial authority may, at any time, upon its motion or upon motion of the respondent, dismiss the petition, or any count thereof, if it determines that . . .</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-9\">\u201c(3) the petition presents the same ground as a prior petition previously denied and fails to state new facts or to proffer new evidence not reasonably available at the time of the prior petition . . . .\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b464-10\"> The petitioner also claims that the court improperly denied his request for the appointment of counsel. In an articulation of its decision, however, the court stated that it \u201cdid not formally deny the petitioner\u2019s request for appointment of counsel\u201d and that it \u201cnever reached the issue of whether to appoint habeas trial counsel because the court dismissed the petition upon preliminary review pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 23-29 (3).\u201d Because the habeas court has stated its willingness to afford the petitioner a hearing on his petition, and, thus, no longer believes that the matter should have been dismissed pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 23-29 (3), we are confident that the court will address the petitioner\u2019s request for counsel.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
