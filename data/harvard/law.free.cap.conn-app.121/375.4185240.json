Lee<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appeals from the judgment of the trial court rendered in favor of the plaintiff, Jo-Ann Jackson, declaring that the plaintiff had acquired a prescriptive easement over a portion of the defendant\u2019s real property.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The defendant claims that the evidence was insufficient to support the court\u2019s finding that the plaintiff had established all of the elements of a prescriptive easement.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>After examining the record on appeal and considering the briefs and the arguments of the parties, we conclude that the judgment of the trial court should be affirmed. Because the court\u2019s memorandum of decision resolves properly the issues raised in this appeal, we adopt the court\u2019s concise and well reasoned decision as a statement of the facts and the applicable law on the issue. See <em>Jackson </em>v. <em>Lee, </em>51 Conn. Sup. 399, 996 A.2d 762 (2009). Any further discussion by this court would serve no useful purpose. See, e.g., <em>Socha </em>v. <em>Bordeau, </em>289 Conn. 358, 362, 956 A.2d 1174 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b397-14\">Wachovia Mortgage Corporation is also a defendant in this action. Because, however, it is not a party to this appeal, we refer to Pascale P. Lee as the defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b397-15\"> Although the plaintiff filed an eight count complaint seeking relief, she prevailed only as to her claim for a prescriptive easement over a portion of the defendant\u2019s property. The plaintiff is not challenging the court\u2019s decision on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
