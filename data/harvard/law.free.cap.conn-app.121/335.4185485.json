The defendant makes four claims on appeal. First, the defendant claims that the court impermissibly restricted his cross-examination of a witness and violated his sixth amendment right to confrontation<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> because the state could not provide an audio recording of that witness\u2019 911 telephone call. Alternatively, if we determine that the court\u2019s ruling was proper, the defendant argues that the court improperly failed to draw a negative inference from the absence of a 911 recording. Next, he claims that the court improperly found that there was sufficient evidence before it to establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he violated the terms of his probation by violating a criminal law of another state. The defendant also claims that the court violated his state and federal constitutional rights by sentencing him on the basis of an inference of a lack of remorse improperly drawn from his having remained silent throughout the proceeding. Last, he claims the court exceeded its authority in sentencing him to serve six years incarceration, execution suspended after thirty-nine months, followed by ten years probation with special conditions. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-4\">The following facts and procedural history underlie the defendant\u2019s appeal. In September, 1997, the defendant was convicted of sexual assault in the first degree and risk of injury to a child as a result of an incident that occurred in 1996.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He subsequently was sentenced to a term of ten years incarceration, suspended after four years, followed by ten years of probation with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>special conditions. Some time after Ms release from incarceration and the commencement of Ms term of probation, the defendant moved to New York City and resided there in a townhouse located at 56 Bank Street. On May 30, 2007, at approximately 9:30 a.m., the New York City police department received a 911 telephone call in wMch the caller, Bittman Rivas, reported that a nude man was on the stoop of the 56 Bank Street townhouse masturbating. Rivas later testified that he saw a wMte lotion on the defendant\u2019s hands while the defendant masturbated on the stoop. Eric Chaffer and Ms partner, both New York City police officers, were dispatched to the address. Upon arrival at the scene, the officers found no one on the stoop. The officers contacted the department\u2019s central dispatching unit, wMch then called Rivas and instructed him to go to the officers\u2019 police crmser located near the scene. Rivas indicated to the officers where the incident took place and described the perpetrator as well as what he had witnessed him doing. The officers then rang the doorbell at 56 Bank Street. After some minutes elapsed, the defendant answered the doorbell. After questioning the defendant for a few moments, the officers requested Ms permission to enter the residence in order to con-tmue their investigation. The defendant consented, and the officers entered the residence with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-6\">Accompamed by the defendant, the officers examined the entire residence. Chaffer testified that prior to entering the townhouse, he observed a trail of droplets of a \u201cwMte liqmd\u201d wMch he \u201ctook to be hand cream\u201d near the doorway just outside the door. He further testified that upon entry, he observed a silver dollar sized \u201cdollop\u201d of the wMte liquid just inside the door on the floor. When Chaffer pointed out the wMte liquid to the defendant, the defendant attempted to wipe away the globules of wMte liqmd with Ms hand and the sole of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>his slipper. The officers completed their investigation and then placed the defendant under arrest. The defendant was charged with one count each of public lewdness in violation of New York Penal Law \u00a7 245.00 and exposure of a person in violation of New York Penal Law \u00a7 245.01.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">Following the defendant\u2019s arrest in New York, a probation officer in Connecticut filed a violation of probation motion, form JD-CR-59V, alleging that the defendant had violated a criminal law. A violation of probation proceeding followed. At the end of the adjudicative phase of the proceeding, the court found that the defendant had violated the terms of his probation. Then, following the dispositional phase of the proceeding, the court revoked the defendant\u2019s probation and sentenced the defendant to a term of incarceration of six years, suspended after thirty-nine months, followed by ten years of probation. From the judgment revoking probation, the defendant appeals. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b361-8\">First, the defendant claims that the court impermissi-bly restricted his cross-examination of Rivas and violated the defendant\u2019s sixth amendment right to confrontation because the state could not provide an audio recording of Rivas\u2019 911 telephone call. Specifically, he claims that the court improperly failed to strike Rivas\u2019 testimony. Alternatively, if we determine that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>court\u2019s ruling was proper, the defendant argues that the court improperly failed to draw a negative inference from the absence of a 911 recording. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">The following additional facts are relevant to our resolution of the defendant\u2019s claim. On November 15, 2007, the defendant filed with the court a motion to dismiss<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> in which he argued, inter alia, that Rivas\u2019 testimony should be stricken because the failure to preserve a recording of Rivas\u2019 911 telephone call, as required by New York law, was also a failure by the state to preserve a prior statement of a material witness.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>The defendant sought, in the alternative, an adverse inference against Rivas and the state, claiming that \u201cthe content of the 911 call must be inferred to be favorable to the defendant because the evidence was not preserved under New York law.\u201d On November 16, 2007, after the close of evidence in the adjudicatory phase, the court heard oral argument on the defendant\u2019s motion. The defendant again argued that Rivas\u2019 testimony should be stricken <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>or, because the tape was not preserved and the state relied indirectly on it, that the court \u201ckind of charge [itself] and make [itself] aware that, you know, there was this tape here.\u201d The defendant contended that because Rivas testified that the call lasted ten minutes, but his cellular telephone records that were admitted into evidence indicated that the call lasted only three minutes, the recording was central to the determination of whether the defendant had violated his probation. The court denied the request to strike Rivas\u2019 testimony. In regard to the defendant\u2019s request for an adverse inference to be drawn, the court noted first that the proceeding was before the court rather than a jury. It then stated that, essentially, it understood the defendant\u2019s motion as an appropriate request for the court to consider the absence of the tape as it related to Rivas\u2019 overall credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">On December 3, 2007, the defendant filed with the court a corrected motion for a new trial. In it he argued, inter alia, that the court should grant a new trial because it improperly had denied his request to strike Rivas\u2019 testimony or, in the alternative, because it failed to draw a negative inference against the state. The court heard oral argument on the corrected motion for a new trial on December 20, 2007, in which the defendant made essentially the same arguments he had made in his motion to dismiss and the accompanying oral argument on that motion. The court admitted into evidence, without objection, a certified copy of a New York City police department communication division certification that expressly stated that the call \u201cdid not record.\u201d See footnote 5 of this opinion. After the court heard both parties on the matter, it denied the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">On appeal the defendant contends that the \u201cfailed disclosure of the [recording of the 911 telephone call] infringed upon the defendant\u2019s sixth amendment right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>[of confrontation] and his ability to have properly cross-examined Rivas\u201d because the recording was a prior witness statement, the absence of which prejudiced the defendant. In other words, the defendant claims that the missing recording was material evidence that the state was constitutionally required to provide to him and that its failure to do such was harmful. Moreover, the defendant asserts, the state was obligated to provide the recording because under New York law, the police were required to record and to preserve Rivas\u2019 911 telephone call.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defendant avers that under New York law the \u201cdestruction\u201d of 911 recordings would have led to a court in that state fashioning a remedy such as striking Rivas\u2019 testimony or to an adverse inference being drawn as to the contents of the tape. Therefore, he maintains, the state \u201cshould not be allowed to derive the benefit of such evidence and then consequently disown the responsibilities imposed by [New York] with respect to such evidence . . . .\u201d Such an argument here is untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">Initially, we note that the loss of liberty that results from a revocation of probation is a severe deprivation that requires affording probationers certain constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>tional protections during the proceeding. See <em>Payne </em>v. <em>Robinson, </em>207 Conn. 565, 574, 541 A.2d 504, cert. denied, 488 U.S. 898, 109 S. Ct. 242, 102 L. Ed. 2d 230 (1988); but see <em>State </em>v. <em>Oliphant, </em>115 Conn. App. 542, 548 n.5, 973 A.2d 147 (noting that \u201c[Revocation of [probation] is not part of a criminal prosecution and thus the full panoply of rights due a defendant in such a proceeding does not apply to [probation] revocations\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]), cert. denied, 293 Conn. 912, 978 A.2d 1113 (2009). Moreover, \u201c[t]here is no doubt of the constitutional obligation of a prosecutor to disclose all material evidence favorable to an accused in his possession, an obligation that exists without statutory or practice book mandates.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Green, </em>194 Conn. 258, 264 n.6, 480 A.2d 526 (1984), cert. denied, 469 U.S. 1191, 105 S. Ct. 964, 83 L. Ed. 2d 969 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">The record reveals that this is not a case in which the state withheld, destroyed or even lost a recording of a 911 telephone call. Our review of the record reveals that the state never had possession of a recording of Rivas\u2019 911 telephone call for the mere fact that one never existed. The defendant does not refute that Rivas\u2019 911 telephone call was never recorded, and, yet, he maintains that the state\u2019s failure to produce such a recording violated his constitutional right of confrontation. \u201cIn order to establish [a constitutional violation, however], the defendant must demonstrate [that] the prosecution <em>had possession </em>of material information favorable to the accused .... <em>State </em>v. <em>Falcone, </em>191 Conn. 12, 17, 463 A.2d 558 (1983); <em>State </em>v. <em>Crumble, </em>24 Conn. App. 57, 63, 585 A.2d 1245, cert. denied, 218 Conn. 902, 588 A.2d 1077 (1991).\u201d (Emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>DeMasi, </em>34 Conn. App. 46, 52, 640 A.2d 138, cert. denied, 230 Conn. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>906, 644 A.2d 920 (1994). As a result, we conclude that because the defendant cannot demonstrate that the state ever possessed a recording of Rivas\u2019 911 telephone call, he has not established a violation of his constitutional right of confrontation.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-6\">Moreover, the defendant\u2019s argument, which is that because New York ostensibly was obligated to preserve a recording of Rivas\u2019 911 telephone call, the court, in essence, was required to treat the absence of the recording as a sanctionable failure of the state, is without merit. First, we have not found, nor has the defendant provided, any case law suggesting that a trial court, when conducting a revocation of probation hearing in which the violation of probation involves the probationer\u2019s having violated a criminal law of another state, must apply the procedural protections afforded in that state under the circumstances presented here.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Moreover, on the basis of our review of the record we cannot conclude that it was improper for the court to conclude that, because the recording never existed, the state was under no obligation under statute, the rules of practice or the federal constitution to provide that which did not exist and that it was not obligated to create or to maintain.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-7\">In <em>State </em>v. <em>Cain, </em>223 Conn. 731, 613 A.2d 804 (1992), our Supreme court concluded that \u201cdespite the fact that the language of Practice Book \u00a7 749 (2) [now \u00a7 40-15 (2)], read literally, would cover the tape recording of a 911 telephone call, it is not within the intent of that language to cover such a tape recording and that, therefore, a tape recording of a 911 telephone call is not a statement within the meaning of [Practice Book \u00a7 40-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>15 (2)] that is subject to preservation and to disclosure . . . .\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 738-39. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>288 Conn. 236, 279, 951 A.2d 1257 (2008) (review of our case law generally reveals nothing that would support existence of affirmative duty to create evidence or to record entirety of communications with witnesses). The court, therefore, did not act improperly in denying the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss and his corrected posttrial motion for a new trial or in denying the defendant\u2019s request to strike Rivas\u2019 testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">The defendant next claims that the court improperly found that there was sufficient evidence before it to establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he violated the terms of his probation by violating a criminal law of another state. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">\u201cIn a probation revocation proceeding, the state bears the burden of proving by a fair preponderance of the evidence that the defendant violated the terms of [her] probation. ... As a reviewing court, we may reverse the trial court\u2019s initial factual determination that a condition of probation has been violated only if we determine that such a finding was clearly erroneous. . . . A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence to support it ... or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. ... In making this determination, every reasonable presumption must be given in favor of the trial court\u2019s ruling . . . .\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Lanagan, </em>119 Conn. App. 53, 59-60, 986 A.2d 1113 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>Rivas testified at the defendant\u2019s revocation hearing,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> as did Chaffer.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The court noted that Rivas was the only individual who had witnessed the defendant on the stoop that morning. The court found that there was nothing in the evidence before it to indicate that Rivas had any motivation to testify as he did \u201cother than his belief in what he observed.\u201d The court stated, nevertheless, that \u201c[i]t would be difficult for this court to find, even by a preponderance of the evidence, that [the defendant] had violated the terms of ... his probation based solely on the testimony of . . . Rivas.\u201d The court, however, noted Chaffer\u2019s corroborating testimony. Particularly, the court noted \u201cthe corroborating testimony of [Chaffer\u2019s] observations of the white cream or liquid present at the scene, which become the link to the observations of . . . Rivas, who stated [that] he saw a white cream on [the defendant\u2019s] hands while he was naked and touching himself, or masturbating, on the front porch.\u201d The court then expressly found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>that Chaffer\u2019s testimony was corroborative of Rivas\u2019 testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">The defendant argues in support of his claim that he proffered substantial evidence that \u201csignificantly challenged the motive and credibility of [Rivas],\u201d and, therefore, the court\u2019s finding that the defendant violated his probation based on the exhibits and testimony was clearly erroneous. We reject this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-7\">As a reviewing court, we may not retry the case or pass on the credibility of witnesses. <em>Statewide Grievance Committee </em>v. Dixon, 62 Conn. App. 507, 511, 772 A.2d 160 (2001). Our review of factual determinations is limited to whether those findings are clearly erroneous. Practice Book \u00a7 60-5; <em>State </em>v. <em>$7379.54 United States Currency, </em>80 Conn. App. 471, 474-75, 844 A.2d 220 (2003). We must defer to the trier of fact\u2019s assessment of the credibility of the witnesses, which is made on the basis of its firsthand observation of their conduct, demeanor and attitude. <em>Boulware </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>66 Conn. App. 869, 872, 786 A.2d 456 (2001), cert. denied, 259 Conn. 913, 791 A.2d 564 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"aqb-dedup-0\">The court, as the finder of fact, found that Rivas\u2019 and Chaffer\u2019s testimony was credible. The weight to be given to the evidence and to the credibility of witnesses is solely within the determination of the trier of fact. <em>State </em>v. <em>Bostwick, 52 </em>Conn. App. 557, 561, 728 A.2d 10, appeal dismissed, 251 Conn. 117, 740 A.2d 381 (1999). The court performed its duty, and we will not usurp its function. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Campbell, </em>61 Conn. App. 99, 103, 762 A.2d 12, cert. denied, 255 Conn. 934, 767 A.2d 105 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-9\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">The defendant also claims that the court violated his state and federal constitutional rights by sentencing him based on an inference of a lack of remorse improperly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>drawn from Ms having remained silent tMoughout the proceeding. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">On November 20, 2007, the court commenced the dispositional phase of the revocation hearing. After hearing testimony from David Carter, the defendant\u2019s Connecticut probation officer, as well as Eric Goldsmith, a forensic psycMatrist, the court revoked the defendant\u2019s probation and sentenced him to serve six years of incarceration, execution suspended after thirty-nine months, followed by ten years probation with special conditions. During its oral decision, the court stated to the defendant: \u201cI gave you your chance . . . and you\u2019ve never [taken responsibility for your actions] and you had numerous opportuMties to do that gomg back to 1997, with the offenses there, with the offenses here, and all along the way tMough probation. And it was pointed out\u2014and I think appropriately so\u2014 by [the state], as I looked at the offender\u2019s attitude m your 1997 presentence investigation, and it was one of total and complete deMal, as it is here today, one of total and complete demal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">In Ms corrected motion for a new trial, the defendant argued that the court \u201cwrongfully inferred that [he] had no remorse for Ms actions in 1996 because he chose not to testify\u201d at Ms probation revocation hearing. Specifically, the defendant claimed that \u201c[f]or the [c]ourt to state that [he] did not have remorse for Ms action . . . merely because he did not make a statement prior to sentencmg is a violation of [Ms] constitutional right[s]\u201d that materially prejudiced him. On December 20, 2007, the court held a hearing on the defendant\u2019s corrected motion for a new trial during wMch it addressed tMs claim. The court stated: \u201c[L]et me be very clear that when I imposed the sentence upon [the defendant], the sentence that I imposed, in no way, shape or form, was reflective of the fact that [the defendant] being within Ms rights not to make a statement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>at sentencing if he chose not to\u2014he chose not to. He was within his rights. I absolutely agree with that, that he is within his rights not to say anything if he chooses not to. . . . So, I want it to be perfectly clear that I agree that he was within his rights, but I also think it should be absolutely clear\u2014if it wasn\u2019t then ... it should be now\u2014that the sentence I imposed had nothing to do with the fact that he chose not to make a statement at sentencing. The sentence that I imposed was based upon a number of other [factors] with regard to the terms of his probation\u2014which he violated\u2014[and] the length of time he owed on his probation.\u201d The court subsequently orally denied the defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial. On appeal, the defendant argues that in sentencing him, the court improperly relied on the inference that he lacked remorse because it cited no eviden-tiary basis, other than his silence at the hearing, from which it could infer that he lacked remorse, and, therefore, it violated his rights under the federal and state constitutions.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">As a general matter, a trial court possesses, within statutorily prescribed limits, broad discretion in sentencing matters in revocation of probation hearings. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Mapp, </em>118 Conn. App. 470, 984 A.2d 108 (2009), cert. denied, 295 Conn. 903, 988 A.2d 879 (2010). On appeal, we will disturb a trial court\u2019s sentencing decision only if that discretion clearly has been abused. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Daniels, </em>248 Conn. 64, 73, 726 A.2d 520 (1999). The fifth amendment to the United States constitution by its terms precludes a person from being \u201ccompelled in any criminal case to be a witness against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>himself . . . .\u201d \u201cThe fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination not only protects the individual against being involuntarily called as a witness against himself in a criminal prosecution but also privileges him not to answer official questions put to him in any other proceeding, civil or criminal, formal or informal, where the answers might incriminate him in future criminal proceedings.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Olin Corp. </em>v. <em>Castells, </em>180 Conn. 49, 53, 428 A.2d 319 (1980). \u201cThe privilege against self-incrimination also carries with it the added benefit that no adverse inference may be drawn against the accused in any criminal proceeding from the accused\u2019s invocation of the privilege.\u201d <em>In re Samantha C., </em>268 Conn. 614, 635, 847 A.2d 883 (2004). That benefit, that no adverse inference may be drawn by the invocation of the privilege, extends to sentencing hearings as well. See <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>United States, </em>526 U.S. 314, 326, 119 S. Ct. 1307, 143 L. Ed. 2d 424 (1999) (only where sentence fixed and judgment of conviction final is there no basis for assertion of fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination). Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>256 Conn. 23, 80, 770 A.2d 908 (2001) (\u201c[a]ugmentation of sentence based on a defendant\u2019s decision to stand on [his or her] right to put the [state] to its proof rather than plead guilty is clearly improper\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). Furthermore, a determination of whether the court sentenced the defendant on the basis of an adverse inference improperly drawn because of his invocation of the privilege should be based on the totality of the circumstances. Cf. id., 82 (review of claims that trial court lengthened sentence as punishment for exercising constitutional right to jury trial should be based on totality of circumstances).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">At the time of sentencing, the court provided a lengthy and detailed analysis of its reasoning behind <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>imposing the sentence that it did. During that discussion, the court pointed to several factors that supported its reasoning. The court first underscored that probation was not a right but a privilege for the defendant to remain incarcerated for less than the full duration of the sentence imposed. The court stated that the privilege of probation, in essence, was based on the expectation that the defendant would abide by the conditions of his probation, including, in part, engaging in rehabilitative treatment. The court indicated its awareness of the progress that the defendant had made in adhering to the conditions of probation and engaging in rehabilitative treatment, noting that he had been downgraded to a less intensive level of supervision because he had been deemed in compliance with the conditions of his probation since his release from prison. The court, however, noted that the defendant\u2019s compliance with the terms of his probation, as well as his progress, were not the only factors to be assessed in determining how best to protect society from him while aiding him in his rehabilitation. The court stressed its need, in imposing its sentence, to balance both the punitive and rehabilitative aspects of that sentence with the need to protect society from future harm. The court then concluded that the defendant had neglected to address properly the \u201csexually deviant urges\u201d that led him to commit the acts that culminated in his arrest in New York. It also stated that the neglect exhibited by the defendant led directly to the acts and that that circumstance was relevant to sentencing. The court then asserted that an overarching concern in fashioning an appropriate sentence was, in light of the acts committed, its desire to protect society from such further acts of the defendant for as long as possible under the circumstances and within its mandate.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> In so doing, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>court eschewed Carter\u2019s recommendation that the defendant be incarcerated for the remaining six years of the 1997 sentence. The court expressed its desire to fashion a sentence that would extend supervision over the defendant by imposing a lesser time of incarceration along with a period of probation, thereby imposing a sentence that conforms with the considerations of punishment, deterrence and rehabilitation. The court then expressed its concerns that the defendant was not amenable to rehabilitation and made the comments noted previously that the defendant complains on appeal violated his rights under the federal constitution.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">On the basis of our review of the record, we conclude that the totality of the circumstances surrounding the defendant\u2019s sentencing gives no indication that the court improperly augmented the defendant\u2019s sentence on the basis of his decision to exercise his privilege to remain silent throughout the revocation hearing. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Kelly, </em>supra, 256 Conn. 82. As the court noted during its sentencing of the defendant, it gave particular consideration to both punishment and deterrence, as well as the rehabilitation of the defendant. Its comments during the sentencing about its concerns over the prospect of the defendant\u2019s rehabilitation, as expressed by the court at that time, in large part, were centered around the defendant\u2019s apparent denial as to the incidents that led to his 1997 conviction, which were reflected in the evidence before the court. Moreover, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>in addressing the defendant\u2019s concerns raised in his corrected motion for a new trial, the court clarified that the imposition of the sentence on the defendant was \u201cin no way, shape or form\u201d influenced by the defendant\u2019s remaining silent through the hearing. Although the defendant asserts that the court\u2019s comments made on December 20,2007, addressing the defendant\u2019s sentencing were a \u201cpatently inappropriate attempt to salvage its unconstitutional remarks,\u201d we conclude that they are inherently part of the totality of the circumstances that we are required to review when addressing a claim that a trial court lengthened a sentence as punishment for exercising a constitutional right. Cf. <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Rell, </em>119 Conn. App. 730, 733 n.3, 990 A.2d 354 (2010) (\u201c[t]he purpose of an articulation is to dispel any . . . ambiguity by clarifying the factual and legal basis upon which the trial court rendered its decision, thereby sharpening the issues on appeal\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]); see also <em>Perugini </em>v. <em>Devino, </em>111 Conn. App. 436, 443, 959 A.2d 1031 (2008) (purpose of clarification is to take prior statement, decision or order and make it easier to understand.) As a result, we conclude that the court did not impermissibly augment the defendant\u2019s sentence for exercising his privilege to remain silent during the revocation hearing. Therefore this claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">Last, the defendant claims the court exceeded its authority in sentencing him to serve six years incarceration, execution suspended after thirty-nine months, followed by ten years probation with special conditions. Specifically, the defendant argues that the court abused its discretion in imposing a sentence to serve thirty-nine months incarceration because it did not fairly reflect the seriousness of the violation of probation. This is so because the underlying criminal conduct that led to the revocation of his probation was punishable by a maximum sentence of ninety days. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>We note that \u201c[t]he element of \u2018punishment\u2019 in probation revocation of [the] defendant is attributable to the crime for which he was originally convicted and sentenced. Thus, any sentence [the] defendant had to serve as the result of the [probation] violation . . . was \u2018punishment\u2019 for the crime of which he had originally been convicted. Revocation is a continuing consequence of the original conviction from which probation was granted.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>207 Conn. 152, 178, 540 A.2d 679 (1988). Accordingly, the defendant\u2019s argument is misplaced because the thirty-nine month sentence is punishment for the criminal conduct that led to his 1997 conviction. As the state properly recognizes, a challenge to the length of the sentence should be made through the sentence review process under General Statutes \u00a7 51-195.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">Insofar as the defendant claims that the court abused its discretion in concluding that the rehabilitative and beneficial aspects of probation were not being met, we conclude that this argument lacks merit. We conclude that on the basis of the whole record, the court properly considered whether the beneficial aspects of probation were being served and, therefore, did not abuse its discretion by revoking the defendant\u2019s probation and reinstating the remainder of the defendant\u2019s original sentence. See part III of this opinion; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Hedge, </em>89 Conn. App. 348, 351, 873 A.2d 254, cert. denied, 274 Conn. 917, 879 A.2d 894 (2005).

The defendant contended that he could not effectively cross-examine Rivas without the recording of the 911 telephone call. The state, in response, indicated to the court that it had been notified by the communication division of the New York City police department that Rivas\u2019 911 telephone call had not been recorded. It also indicated that the defendant had been furnished with a certified copy of a New York City police department communication division certification that expressly stated that the call \u201c[d]id [n]ot [rjecord.\u201d The court denied the defendant\u2019s motion, and the hearing proceeded.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b364-7\"> The defendant purports that \u00a7 5203 (e) of title 21 of the New York Codes, Rules and Regulations required the police to record Rivas\u2019 911 telephone call.
