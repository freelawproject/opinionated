On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court improperly (1) admitted into evidence certain out-of-court statements by the victim<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and (2) denied the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-82m. We disagree and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">The jury reasonably could have found the following facts. In the spring of 2001, the victim was eight years old and resided in an apartment with her mother, siblings and the defendant. On one occasion, the defendant removed the victim\u2019s shorts and underwear and attempted to penetrate her anally. The victim did not report this incident to anyone at the time because she was \u201cscared and embarrassed.\u201d The defendant subsequently left the residence, and this caused the victim to feel safe and confident that it would not happen again.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">In January, 2003, the defendant returned to the residence. The defendant again sexually assaulted the victim. Specifically, there were instances of oral sex and penile-vaginal intercourse. In March, 2003, the victim told family members and a friend what the defendant had done. The next day, the victim was taken to Connecticut Children\u2019s Medical Center. After spending nearly four hours there, the victim was referred to Saint Francis Hospital and Medical Center (Saint Francis Hospital) for subsequent medical treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>The operative information set forth ten counts charging the defendant with offenses from 2001 and 2003. Following a trial, the jury returned a guilty verdict with respect to eight of the counts contained in the information.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court sentenced the defendant to ninety years incarceration. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">The defendant first claims that the court improperly admitted into evidence certain out-of-court statements by the victim. Specifically, he contends that testimony of Lisa Murphy-Cipolla, a licensed family therapist, regarding statements made to her by the victim, were admitted into evidence improperly under the medical treatment exception to the rule against hearsay. See Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-3 (5). The defendant argues that the primary purpose of Murphy-Cipolla\u2019s interview with the victim was to obtain information for police officers that supported their application for a search warrant. We conclude that the court properly admitted the testimony pursuant to the medical treatment exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">The following additional facts are necessary for our resolution of this issue. After initially receiving medical treatment at Connecticut Children\u2019s Medical Center, the victim was referred to Saint Francis Hospital. On April 3, 2003, Murphy-Cipolla, an employee of the Aetna Foundation Children\u2019s Center, which is located at Saint Francis Hospital, interviewed the victim for approximately fifty minutes. Outside of the presence of the jury, Murphy-Cipolla stated that the victim told her of multiple instances of abuse by the defendant. The victim detailed one incident that occurred in the kitchen of the residence. As a result of this incident, semen was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"779\">*779</page-number>deposited on a chair cushion, and subsequent DNA testing revealed that the defendant was a contributor. Police officers observed Murphy-Cipolla\u2019s interview with the defendant behind a one-way mirror. At one point, Murphy-Cipolla consulted with an officer and asked the victim about the kitchen chair cushion.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">The defendant objected on the ground that Murphy-Cipolla\u2019s testimony regarding the victim\u2019s statements to her during the interview constituted inadmissible hearsay. After hearing argument from counsel, the court ruled that the victim\u2019s statements to Murphy-Cipolla, while hearsay, fell within the medical treatment exception. Following the court\u2019s ruling, the jury returned to the courtroom, and Murphy-Cipolla testified that the victim told her that the defendant had sexually assaulted her. In addition to details about the various assaults, Murphy-Cipolla further testified that the victim stated that the defendant had ejaculated during some of the assaults and that afterward, the victim\u2019s vagina was sore and red. Murphy-Cipolla concluded her testimony by indicating that the victim was aware that these incidents would affect her for the rest of her life and that she had to tell someone about them.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">As a general rule, hearsay is inadmissible unless an exception from the Code of Evidence, the General Statutes or the rules of practice applies. See Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 8-2; <em>State </em>v. Anderson, 86 Conn. App. 854, 876, 864 A.2d 35, cert. denied, 273 Conn. 924, 871 A.2d 1031 (2005). Section 8-3 of the Connecticut Code of Evidence, which describes the medical treatment exception to the hearsay rule, provides in relevant part: \u201cThe following are not excluded by the hearsay rale, even though the declarant is available as a witness ... (5) ... A statement made for purposes of obtaining a medical diagnosis or treatment and describing medical history, or past or present symptoms, pain, or sensations, or the inception or general character of the cause or external <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"780\">*780</page-number>source thereof, insofar as reasonably pertinent to the medical diagnosis or treatment.\u201d \u201cIn other words, the admissibility of out-of-court statements made by a patient to a medical care provider depends on whether the statements were made for the purposes of obtaining medical diagnosis or treatment. . . . The rationale for excluding from the hearsay rule statements made in furtherance of obtaining treatment is that we presume that such statements are inherently reliable because the patient has an incentive to tell the truth in order to obtain a proper medical diagnosis and treatment. . . . The term medical encompasses psychological as well as somatic illnesses and conditions.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Donald M., </em>113 Conn. App. 63, 70, 966 A.2d 266, cert. denied, 291 Conn. 910, 969 A.2d 174 (2009); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Cruz, </em>260 Conn. 1, 7-8, 792 A.2d 823 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b802-6\">\u201cOur Supreme Court recently enunciated a two part standard of review for claims of evidentiary error. In <em>State </em>v. <em>Saucier, </em>283 Conn. 207, 926 A.2d 633 (2007) (en banc), the court stated: To the extent a trial court\u2019s admission of evidence is based on an interpretation of the [Connecticut] Code of Evidence, our standard of review is plenary. For example, whether a challenged statement properly may be classified as hearsay and whether a hearsay exception properly is identified are legal questions demanding plenary review. They require determinations about which reasonable minds may not differ; there is no judgment call by the trial court .... We review the trial court\u2019s decision to admit evidence, if premised on a correct view of the law, however, for an abuse of discretion.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Telford, </em>108 Conn. App. 435, 439, 948 A.2d 350, cert. denied, 289 Conn. 905, 957 A.2d 875 (2008). In order to determine the appropriate standard of review, we must look to the precise nature of the claim raised on appeal. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Saucier, </em>supra, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>217-18. We first determine the appropriate standard of review by examining the nature of the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-4\">The defendant argues that the primary purpose of the victim\u2019s interview with Murphy-Cipolla was to provide information to the observing police officer with the ultimate goal of obtaining a search warrant for the kitchen cushions. A similar claim was raised in <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>supra, 86 Conn. App. 874-75. In <em>Anderson, </em>we stated: \u201cThe key on which the issue of admissibility of the victim\u2019s statements turns is the purpose of the examination. The defendant claims the purpose of the examination was investigatory, but the court concluded that it was for treatment.\u201d Id., 878. In rejecting the defendant\u2019s claim, we observed: \u201cTo the extent that the court made its decision on credibility grounds, we yield, as we must, to the court\u2019s assessment. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Rollins, </em>51 Conn. App. 478, 485, 723 A.2d 817 (1999).\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>supra, 879. Additionally, we note that in <em>Saucier, </em>our Supreme Court stated that \u201cappellate courts will defer to the trial court\u2019s determinations on issues dictated by the exercise of discretion, fact finding, or credibility assessments.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Saucier, </em>supra, 283 Conn. 219. Because the purpose of the victim\u2019s interview with Murphy-Cipolla is determined on the basis of the credibility of the witnesses, we employ the abuse of discretion standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">Jean Carlson, the triage nurse at Connecticut Children\u2019s Medical Center, testified that the victim was referred to Saint Francis Hospital for subsequent medical treatment. At that time, Connecticut Children\u2019s Medical Center was \u201climited\u201d as to what it could do for the victim. Therefore, patients were referred to Saint Francis Hospital because that was \u201cwhere abuse cases were followed up.\u201d The victim\u2019s father testified that he took the victim to Saint Francis Hospital for the purpose of obtaining further medical treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>Murphy-Cipolla testified that she had earned a master\u2019s degree in counselor education with a specialization in marriage and family therapy and was licensed as a family therapist. She also detailed her training and experience with interviewing victims of abuse. As part of her employment, she conducted diagnostic interviews for the evaluation, treatment and prevention of child abuse.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> She stated specifically: \u201cThe purpose of the interview is to elicit clear and accurate information, minimize any additional trauma and then, based on what is disclosed during the course of an interview, to go on and <em>make the necessary recommendations for mental health and, or, the need for a medical exam.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) She also noted that the interviewer\u2019s report is part of the medical record and is shared with the medical provider. While the victim was at Saint Francis Hospital, a pediatric nurse practioner, Audrey Courtney, performed a medical examination of the victim. Courtney testified that she used the information obtained by Murphy-Cipolla during the interview in the course of the medical examination of the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">On the basis of this evidence, we cannot conclude that the court abused its discretion in finding that the purpose of the victim\u2019s interview was for medical treatment. The court heard testimony from several witnesses and found them to be credible.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We yield to the court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>assessment on such matters. See <em>State </em>v. <em>Anderson, </em>supra, 86 Conn. App. 879. Further, we are not persuaded by the defendant\u2019s argument that because the victim knew that police officers were present during the interview, the purpose of her interview with Murphy-Cipolla was not for medical treatment. This fact does not undermine the medical treatment purpose of the interview. Cf. <em>State </em>v. <em>Slater, </em>285 Conn. 162, 184, 939 A.2d 1105, cert. denied, 553 U.S. 1085, 128 S. Ct. 2885, 171 L. Ed. 2d 822 (2008). Last, we reject the defendant\u2019s contention that the court relied on pure speculation that the victim would be more truthful in response to Murphy-Cipolla\u2019s questions because she knew of the police presence. Although the court mentioned that it was likely that such knowledge would \u201cstrengthen her resolve ... to be forthcoming and to be more accurate,\u201d we are satisfied that the court merely was opining that the hearsay, already found to be reliable due to the operation of the medical treatment exception, was even more so due to the presence of the police officer. We fail to see, however, how this statement affected the court\u2019s determination of the admissibility of the testimony from MurphyCippolla. We conclude, therefore, that the court did not abuse its discretion in permitting Muiphy-Cipolla\u2019s testimony to be admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b805-7\">The defendant next claims that the court improperly denied his motion to dismiss the case for lack of a speedy trial pursuant to \u00a7 54-82m. Specifically, he argues that his statutory right to a speedy trial was violated and that the court improperly failed to dismiss the criminal charges against him. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-8\">The following additional facts are necessary for the resolution of the defendant\u2019s claim. The defendant was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>arrested on March 28, 2004. On June 1, 2005, the defendant rejected a plea bargain offer made by the state. On June 1,2007, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 41-8 (5), (7) and (9). He alleged in this motion that since June 1, 2005, there had been no \u201cprosecution or other disposition of these [matters].\u201d He further argued that the charges against him should have been nolled by operation of law and dismissed. As authority, he cited Practice Book \u00a7 43-39 (d),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> General Statutes \u00a7 54-142a (c)<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and <em>State </em>v. <em>Winer, </em>99 Conn. App. 579, 915 A.2d 883 (2007), rev\u2019d, 286 Conn. 666, 945 A.2d 430 (2008).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> In the alternative, the defendant also alleged: \u201c[Practice Book \u00a7] 43-39 et seq., as provided for in [General Statutes] \u00a7 54-82m, establishes certain specific time limits during which criminal defendants shall be brought to trial, effectuating the right to a speedy trial guaranteed by [a]rticle [first, \u00a7 8, of] the [constitution of the [s]tate of Connecticut and the [sixth] [a]mendment to the [c]onstitution of the United States. . . . [The] [d]efendant\u2019s case has been pending <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>in excess of the eight month period specified by [Practice Book \u00a7] 43-39 et seq. and ... \u00a7 54-82m.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">On August 8, 2007, the court denied the defendant\u2019s motion. Specifically, it determined that the defendant\u2019s case factually was distinguishable from the <em>Winer </em>case. It did not, however, expressly address the defendant\u2019s \u00a7 54-82m claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-7\">\u201cThe speedy trial statute [\u00a7 54-82m] requires the judges of the Superior Court to adopt rules that are necessary to assure a speedy trial for any person charged with a criminal offense .... With respect to a defendant who is incarcerated in a correction institution of this state pending trial, \u00a7 54-82m requires the rules to provide: (1) in any case in which a plea of not guilty is entered, the trial of a defendant charged in an information or indictment with the commission of a criminal offense shall commence . . . within eight months from the filing date of the information or indictment or from the date of arrest, whichever is later; and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"786\">*786</page-number>(2) if a defendant is not brought to trial within the time limit set forth in subdivision (1) and a trial is not commenced within thirty days of a motion for a speedy trial made by the defendant at any time after such time limit has passed, the information or indictment shall be dismissed. Such rules shall include provisions to identify periods of delay caused by the action of the defendant, or the defendant\u2019s inability to stand trial, to be excluded in computing the time limits set forth in subdivision (1). . . . Practice Book \u00a7 43-40 then sets forth ten circumstances constituting those periods of time [that] shall be excluded in computing the [eight months] within which the trial of a defendant . . . must commence pursuant to Section 43-39 . . . .\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Cote, </em>101 Conn.

The trial court\u2019s conclusions must stand unless they are legally and logically inconsistent with the facts. . . . Although the right to a speedy trial is fundamental, it is necessarily relative, since a requirement of unreasonable speed would have an adverse impact both on the accused and on society.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Jeffreys, 78 </em>Conn.

The defendant never filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"787\">*787</page-number>a motion for articulation pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 66-5. Additionally, the record is devoid of any information that would apply to whether any of the relevant time period was subject to exclusion; see Practice Book \u00a7 43-40; from the speedy trial calculus. In short, the record is inadequate to review the defendant\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-4\">Practice Book \u00a7 61-10 provides in relevant part that \u201c[i]t is the responsibility of the appellant to provide an adequate record for review. ...\u201d Moreover, we have stated that \u201c[i]t is incumbent upon the appellant to take the necessary steps to sustain its burden of providing an adequate record for appellate review. . . .
