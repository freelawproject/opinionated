On appeal, the petitioner claims that the court improperly (1) dismissed count two of the habeas petition for failure to state a cause of action and (2) denied her claim of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>ineffective assistance of counsel. We affirm the judgment of the habeas court.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">The facts surrounding the underlying conviction were set forth in the decision of this court disposing of the petitioner\u2019s criminal appeal. \u201cLennox Walker, the victim\u2019s father, arranged for the [petitioner] to care for the victim, Lamar Walker, who was four months old. Kerry Ann Douglas, the victim\u2019s mother, took the victim to the [petitioner\u2019s] apartment on the morning of August 12,1994. Approximately two hours after the victim was left in the [petitioner\u2019s] care, the victim required hospitalization because he was not breathing. At 11:18 a.m., a police certified dispatcher received a 911 call from 887 Asylum Avenue in Hartford, the location of the [petitioner\u2019s] apartment. Emergency personnel responded and found that the victim was not breathing, had no pulse, and was cold, pale and blue from lack of oxygen in his blood. The paramedics transported the victim to Saint Francis Hospital and Medical Center. Because of the victim\u2019s special needs at that time, he was taken by Life Star helicopter to Hartford Hospital, which has an intensive care unit specially designed for very young children. Medical examination of the victim revealed that he had sustained the following injuries: Severe swelling of the brain, bleeding in the head, retinal hemorrhage and fractures in five bones. On August 14, 1994, the victim died at the hospital from the injuries he had sustained.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>68 Conn. App. 351, 352-53, 789 A.2d 1135 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">On December 13, 1999, the petitioner was charged with one count each of manslaughter in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (1) and (3), risk of injury to a child in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53-21 and tampering with a witness in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-151. Following a trial, a jury found the petitioner guilty of manslaughter in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-55 (a) (3) and risk of injury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>to a child in violation of \u00a7 53-21. <em>State </em>v. <em>Grant, </em>supra, 68 Conn. App. 351. On February 28, 2000, the court imposed a total effective sentence of thirty years incarceration, suspended after twenty years, with five years of probation. The petitioner appealed from the judgment of conviction to this court, and we affirmed the judgment of the trial court. Id. On October 29, 2003, the petitioner filed a pro se petition for a writ of habeas corpus, which was amended twice, most recently through counsel on April 2, 2007. Only two counts of the second amended petition are subjects of this appeal: count two, alleging that postjudgment medical and scientific evidence contradicted the state\u2019s expert opinion, and count three, alleging ineffective assistance of her trial counsel, Sara Bernstein. The court dismissed count two during the habeas trial and, by memorandum of decision dated June 4, 2008, denied the habeas petition as to count three.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The court granted the petition for certification to appeal from the judgment denying the habeas petition. This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">We first set forth our standard of review for a denial of a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. \u201cThe conclusions reached by the trial court in its decision to dismiss [a] habeas petition are matters of law, subject to plenary review. . . . [When] the legal conclusions of the court are challenged, [the reviewing court] must determine whether they are legally and logically correct . . . and whether they find support in the facts that appear in the record. ... To the extent that factual findings are challenged, this court cannot disturb the underlying facts found by the habeas court unless they are clearly erroneous .... [A] finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>... or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Harris </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>107 Conn. App. 833, 838, 947 A.2d 7, cert. denied, 288 Conn. 908, 953 A.2d 652 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">The petitioner first claims that the court improperly dismissed count two of the habeas petition for failure to state a cause of action. Specifically, the petitioner argues that because newly discovered medical and scientific evidence \u201cundermines the validity and viability of the state\u2019s theory of criminal liability,\u201d she should be granted a new trial. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">In the second count of her amended habeas petition, the petitioner alleged that studies published after her conviction contain medical and scientific evidence on shaken baby syndrome that contradict the opinions proffered at trial by the state\u2019s expert witness. Prior to trial, the respondent, the commissioner of correction, moved to dismiss this count on the ground that the petitioner had not pleaded actual innocence. On April 13,2007, the court, <em>Fuger, J., </em>denied the motion without a memorandum of decision. On October 24, 2007, at the close of the petitioner\u2019s case-in-chief, the respondent orally moved for a directed verdict on count two.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The respondent argued that the petitioner had not offered any postjudgment medical or scientific evidence that contradicted the evidence that the state put forth in her criminal trial and that the petitioner had not made a claim of actual innocence. Thereafter, the court, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number><em>Swords, J., </em>dismissed count two, and stated in the memorandum of decision: \u201cThe court dismissed count two after the petitioner\u2019s case-in-chief because the count failed to state a cause of action. Count two is captioned \u2018[p]ost-judgment medical and scientific evidence contradicts the state\u2019s \u2018expert\u2019 opinions.\u2019 At best, this claim merely draws attention to the fact that medical and scientific reasoning evolve over time, a not too novel notion. This claim is not, however, a cognizable habeas corpus claim. Thus, the discussion [in the court\u2019s decision] is limited to counts one and three.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">Practice Book \u00a7 23-29 provides in relevant part that \u201c[t]he judicial authority may, at any time, upon its own motion or upon motion of the respondent, dismiss the petition, or any count thereof, if it determines that . . . (2) the petition, or a count thereof, fails to state a claim upon which habeas corpus relief can be granted [or] (5) any other legally sufficient ground for dismissal of the petition exists.\u201d A petition for a writ of habeas corpus must set forth specific grounds for the issuance of the writ. Practice Book \u00a7 23-22 (1) specifically provides that the petition shall state \u201cthe specific facts upon which each specific claim of illegal confinement is based and the relief requested . . . .\u201d See <em>Fernandez </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>86 Conn. App. 42, 49, 859 A.2d 948 (2004) (\u201cThe petition for a writ of habeas corpus is essentially a pleading and, as such, it should conform generally to a complaint in a civil action. . . . The principle that a plaintiff may rely only upon what he has alleged is basic. ... It is fundamental in our law that the right of a plaintiff to recover is limited to the allegations of his complaint.\u201d [Internal quotation marks omitted.]). \u201cWhile the habeas court has considerable discretion to frame a remedy that is commensurate with the scope of the established constitutional violations ... it does not have the discretion to look beyond the pleadings and trial evidence to decide claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>not raised. . . . The purpose of the [petition] is to put the [respondent] on notice of the claims made, to limit the issues to be decided, and to prevent surprise.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Holley </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>62 Conn. App. 170, 181, 774 A.2d 148 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b323-4\">Count two of the petitioner\u2019s amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus includes no allegation of actual innocence on which to premise her claims regarding newly available postjudgment scientific evidence. It simply alleges: \u201cNotwithstanding whatever level of acceptance [shaken baby syndrome] may have enjoyed within the medical and scientific community at the time of trial, substantive independent scholarship has been produced since the trial court\u2019s judgment that undermines the validity and viability of the theory of criminal liability, as adduced and argued by the [s]tate.\u201d In her argument before this court, the petitioner claims that count two states a cause of action of actual innocence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> From our review of the record, we conclude that it was never made clear to the habeas court that the petitioner was proceeding on an actual innocence claim.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Id. Instead, the petitioner proceeded under the general theory that the evidence presented at the habeas trial showed that the state\u2019s evidence related to shaken baby syndrome that was presented at the criminal trial was not valid. The ambiguous pleadings that do not allege actual innocence and the failure of the petitioner to advise the court of her theory during the habeas trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>provide a sufficient legal basis to affirm the court\u2019s dismissal of count two of the habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-6\">The petitioner contends that we should <em>interpret </em>her claim as one of actual innocence, even though it was not stated as such, and refers to <em>Summerville </em>v. <em>Warden, </em>229 Conn. 397, 641 A.2d 1356 (1994), in support of that contention. That reliance is misplaced. <em>Summerville </em>is factually distinguishable from this case because in <em>Summerville, </em>it was undisputed that the petitioner was making a claim of actual innocence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In that case, the petitioner claimed that he was entitled by way of a writ of habeas corpus to a new trial \u201cbecause the evidence at his criminal trial was medically unreliable.\u201d Id., 420. The court in <em>Summerville </em>clearly stated that \u201c[t]he petitioner\u2019s claim is, as he states, one of \u2018factual innocence.\u2019 On the basis of . . . testimony that the cause of death of the victim was not asphyxiation resulting from manual strangulation, but acute cocaine intoxication, the petitioner claims that he is the victim of a miscarriage of justice because \u2018no crime was committed.\u2019 \u201d Id. Because the petitioner here never presented a claim of actual innocence at the time of trial, <em>Summerville </em>provides no basis for the viability of count two.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>II</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">The petitioner next claims that the court improperly denied her claim as to count three, which alleged ineffective assistance of counsel. Specifically, she claims that the court improperly found that Bernstein adequately prepared for trial and conducted sufficient investigation into potential defenses and that she adequately challenged the state\u2019s expert witnesses on the scientific fundamentals of shaken baby syndrome. We do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">Our standard of review of a habeas court\u2019s judgment on ineffective assistance of counsel claims is well settled. \u201cIn <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984), the United States Supreme Court enunciated the two requirements that must be met before a petitioner is entitled to reversal of a conviction due to ineffective assistance of counsel. First, the [petitioner] must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient. . . . Second, the [petitioner] must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. . . . Unless a [petitioner] makes both showings, it cannot be said that the conviction . . . resulted from a breakdown in the adversarial process that renders the result unreliable.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>117 Conn. App. 120, 124-25, 977 A.2d 772, cert. denied, 294 Conn. 904, 982 A.2d 647 (2009). Furthermore, \u201c[i]n a habeas corpus proceeding, the petitioner\u2019s burden of proving that a fundamental unfairness had been done <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>is not met by speculation . . . but by demonstrable realities.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Crawford </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>285 Conn. 585, 599, 940 A.2d 789 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">We note that \u201c[judicial scrutiny of counsel's performance must be highly deferential. It is all too tempting for a defendant to second-guess counsel\u2019s assistance after conviction or adverse sentence, and it is all too easy for a court, examining counsel's defense after it has proved unsuccessful, to conclude that a particular act or omission of counsel was unreasonable. ... A fair assessment of attorney performance requires that every effort be made to eliminate the distorting effects of hindsight, to reconstruct the circumstances of counsel's challenged conduct, and to evaluate the conduct from counsel\u2019s perspective at the time. Because of the difficulties inherent in making the evaluation, a court must indulge a strong presumption that counsel\u2019s conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance; that is, the defendant must overcome the presumption that, under the circumstances, the challenged action might be considered sound trial strategy.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Bryant </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>290 Conn. 502, 512-13, 964 A.2d 1186, cert. denied sub nom. <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>Bryant, </em>558 U.S. 938, 130 S. Ct. 259, 175 L. Ed. 2d 242 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">The court heard testimony from several witnesses, including Bernstein and attorney Hope Seeley, who was qualified as an expert witness in criminal defense practice. The court also had before it the transcripts from the criminal trial. The court made the following factual findings that relate to Bernstein\u2019s preparation and investigation of the case. Bernstein reviewed the state\u2019s entire file and obtained copies of police reports and witnesses\u2019 statements. She also reviewed the files of and consulted with three attorneys who had previously represented the petitioner. Bernstein had recently acted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>as co-counsel in a shaken baby case, during which time she had reviewed scientific literature and consulted with numerous experts on the issue. She also consulted with two attorneys who were familiar with shaken baby syndrome cases in conjunction with the petitioner\u2019s case. Further, Bernstein sent her investigator to interview the state\u2019s witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-6\">Assistant public defender Karen Goodrow, who had previously represented the petitioner, had hired Mark Taff, a former medical examiner for the states of New York and New Jersey, to consult on the petitioner\u2019s case. Bernstein was familiar with Taffs background and experience and with the fact that he had testified in a number of cases and was highly regarded. Bernstein sent Taff a copy of the reports and the X ray films in the case. Taff informed Bernstein that in general he agreed with the state\u2019s experts that the injuries could have resulted from an impact or from one or more shakes. Taff further told Bernstein that the usual course of this type of brain injury would be instantaneous unconsciousness such that the victim would not be able to cry vigorously or to feed, and he indicated that in some cases the child might be semiconscious for a period and put the outer limit of observable symptoms at twenty-four hours. On the basis of these conversations with Taff, Bernstein made the decision not to call him to testify for the petitioner. Bernstein reasoned that although some of Taffs testimony might help the defense case, overall his corroboration of the conclusions of the state\u2019s experts would be more harmful. Additionally, because both Lewis and the petitioner claimed that the victim had been crying while in the petitioner\u2019s care, Taffs opinion that the victim likely would not cry vigorously after receiving injury supported the state\u2019s theory as to the timing of the injury and therefore the identity of the perpetrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>Bernstein later consulted with Gordon Sze, chief of neuroradiology at the Yale School of Medicine. Sze, after reviewing reports, X rays and computerized tomography (CT) scans, told Bernstein that although he believed the injuries to the victim were caused by shaking, in his opinion, those injuries were inflicted no less than twelve hours before a CT scan was taken and that the injuries could have occurred as much as eighteen to twenty-four hours before the scans. On the basis of this opinion, Bernstein decided to call Sze to testify and to focus solely on the timing of the injuries. Bernstein believed that other state\u2019s evidence could corroborate Sze\u2019s testimony in that the petitioner was on record as recommending to Douglas that Douglas take the victim to the hospital, and the hospital record showed Walker was upset because Douglas did not take the victim to a doctor.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-6\">The court further found, as to the claims that Bernstein failed to challenge the state\u2019s expert witnesses adequately on the scientific fundamentals of shaken baby syndrome, that \u201c[e]ven if Bernstein had educated herself and used such \u2018evidence\u2019 in her cross-examination of the state\u2019s witnesses, it is unclear what effect that would have had. As stated previously, none of the state\u2019s expert witnesses limited their opinion as to the cause of the victim\u2019s injuries to shaking alone. Rather, each state\u2019s witness gave several probable causes for the injuries, including a fall, an object striking the head or shaking. Moreover ... in 1998, [Ann-Christine Duhaime, a physician and researcher who has published several articles in medical journals on shaken baby syndrome] conceded that the issue of whether shaking alone is sufficient was still not decided. Additionally, Duhaime\u2019s 1992 study found that retinal hemorrhages are rarely found in accidental head injuries but axe commonly found in inflicted injuries. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>\u201c[Also] [according to the petitioner, Bernstein used Taff, but his specialty was not shaken baby syndrome; instead, Bernstein should have used a pathologist with expertise in shaken baby syndrome, a neurosurgeon and a biomechanical engineer. . . . [T]he court emphasizes that in the habeas case, the petitioner did not present a pathologist with expertise in shaken baby syndrome ([the specialty of one of the petitioner\u2019s expert witnesses, Roger McLendon] as a pathologist is brain tumors) or present a neurosurgeon at all. Thus, the petitioner has failed to prove that a pathologist with expertise in shaken baby syndrome or a neurosurgeon would have contradicted the state\u2019s expert witnesses.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">In its memorandum of decision, which included a thorough review of the evidence, the court found that the claim that Bernstein provided ineffective assistance in preparing for trial and adequately investigating defenses was without merit and that Bernstein\u2019s defense strategy was reasonable and well implemented. It further concluded that as to the claim that Bernstein failed to challenge adequately the state\u2019s witnesses on the shaken baby syndrome, the petitioner had failed to prove prejudice from any deficient performance by Bernstein. On the basis of our review of the record, we conclude that the court properly determined that trial counsel\u2019s strategy was reasonable under the circumstances and that the petitioner had failed to prove prejudice from any failure to challenge the state\u2019s theory of shaken baby syndrome.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-7\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b320-7\"> As to count one, which alleged \u201cunsubstantiated expert testimony,\u201d the habeas court determined that the petitioner was procedurally defaulted. The petitioner does not challenge this on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b321-9\"> We note that, as a habeas trial is without a jury, the motion should not have been characterized as a motion for a directed verdict but would be more accurately presented as a motion for dismissal for failure to make out a prima facie case under Practice Book \u00a7 15-8.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b323-5\"> We note that in her first amended petition, the petitioner did expressly allege a claim of actual innocence but that that claim is not contained in the operative petition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b323-6\"> In fact, during the respondent\u2019s argument on her motion for a directed verdict, she argued: \u201cIf there\u2019s a claim of actual innocence based on these studies . . . they\u2019re not stated here.\u201d The petitioner\u2019s only response was that \u201c[t]he court ultimately may have to make a . . . legal determination as to count two, but it was an evidentiary claim made by [the] petitioner with respect to the motion we believe that\u2019s not satisfied.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b324-7\"> The court in <em>Summerville </em>found that the petitioner\u2019s evidence was insufficient for the habeas court to evaluate it for the purpose of determining whether, taken together with and in light of the trial evidence, the writ of habeas corpus should issue on the ground that the petitioner was actually innocent and reversed the judgment of the Appellate Court and remanded the case with direction to affirm the habeas court\u2019s dismissal of the petition. <em>Summerville </em>v. Warden, supra, 229 Conn. 400, 440. The court, however, did consider this issue on its merits. See id., 418.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b324-12\"> Moreover, we note that at the habeas trial, the petitioner called two expert witnesses, Chris Van Ee, a biomedical engineer, and Roger McLendon, a physician who was qualified as an expert in neuropathology and anatomic pathology, to testify. Although the petitioner claims that Van Ee and McLendon presented new evidence, they did not and simply based their opinions on studies that were published and research that was conducted both before and after the judgment of conviction. Neither expert introduced any medical or scientific evidence that was substantially different from that available during the trial, and neither made a clear connection illustrating the differ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>ence between the research available before 2000 and the research available since that date. The testimony at the habeas trial simply extended the battle of the experts that existed at the criminal trial. Therefore, even if we were to examine this claim as one of actual innocence as in <em>Summerville, </em>the facts of this case do not constitute a situation in which the petitioner would be entitled to a new trial. The testimony of Van Ee and McClendon at the habeas trial, like the expert testimony in <em>Summerville, </em>does not rise to the level required to reverse the habeas court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
