We conclude that the court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion is not a final judgment and dismiss his interlocutory appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-14\">\u201cIt is axiomatic that appellate jurisdiction is limited to final judgments of the trial court.\u201d <em>State </em>v. <em>Crawford, </em>257 Conn. 769, 774, 778 A.2d 947 (2001), cert. denied, 534 U.S. 1138, 122 S. Ct. 1086, 151 L. Ed. 2d 985 (2002); see also General Statutes \u00a7 52-263. \u201cThe appealable final <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>judgment in a criminal case is ordinarily the imposition of sentence.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>191 Conn. 27, 31, 463 A.2d 566 (1983). However, an exception exists for a small class of cases that are effectively unreviewable on appeal from a final judgment. <em>State </em>v. <em>Crawford, </em>supra, 775; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>supra, 31 (\u201c[a]n otherwise interlocutory order is appealable in two circumstances: [1] where the order or action terminates a separate and distinct proceeding, or [2] where the order or action so concludes the rights of the parties that further proceedings cannot affect them\u201d). \u201cThe paradigmatic case in this group involves the right against double jeopardy.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Crawford, </em>supra, 775 (\u201c[t]he right not to be tried necessarily falls into the category of rights that can be enjoyed only if vindicated prior to trial\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). The rationale for the rule permitting a criminal defendant to file an interlocutory appeal from the denial of a motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds emanates from double jeopardy\u2019s protection against successive prosecution. Id., 777. \u201c[I]n order to give meaning to the successive prosecution part of the protection against double jeopardy, we permit a defendant to file an interlocutory appeal from the denial of a motion to dismiss so long as that motion presents a colorable double jeopardy claim.\u201d Id.; see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Curcio, </em>supra, 33-34 (\u201c[a] presentence order will be deemed final for purposes of appeal only if it involves a claimed right the legal and practical value of which would be destroyed if it were not vindicated before trial\u201d [internal quotation marks omitted]). The rationale for the exception is not applicable here.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-6\">The defendant was charged with robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (4) (count one) and criminal possession of a pistol in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>violation of \u00a7 53a-217c (a) (1) (count two).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendant elected a jury trial on count one and a court trial on count two.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The record indicates that the defendant\u2019s election of a court trial with respect to count two was motivated by a desire to keep evidence of his prior felony convictions from the jury. Evidence was presented simultaneously to the court and jury on January 23 and 26, 2009. On January 27, 2009, outside the presence of the jury, the state submitted evidence of the defendant\u2019s prior felony convictions. On January 29, 2009, the jury began deliberations on count one and returned a verdict of not guilty. On January 30, 2009, the court heard closing arguments on count two, indicated that it would reserve decision until it reviewed the exhibits and proceeded without objection to the defendant\u2019s violation of probation hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">On February 2, 2009, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss count two pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 54-56. He claimed that the court was collaterally estopped from finding him guilty of criminal possession of a pistol because the jury had already returned a general not guilty verdict of robbery in the first degree.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On February 4, 2009, the court denied the defendant\u2019s motion, relying on <em>State </em>v. <em>Knight, </em>266 Conn. 658, 835 A.2d 47 (2003) (holding collateral estoppel does not apply to the proceduraily unique situation in which several criminal charges against the same defendant have been allocated between two triers for concurrent adjudication in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>single proceeding), and found the defendant guilty of criminal possession of a pistol. This interlocutory appeal followed.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">The defendant claims that the court\u2019s failure to render its decision simultaneously with the jury verdict transformed the trial into two separate proceedings, and, as a result, his interlocutory appeal presents a colorable double jeopardy claim. We disagree. Although the defendant\u2019s claim involves the collateral estoppel branch of double jeopardy,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> it does not implicate the circumstances that give rise to the exception. \u201cThe exception to the rule that sentencing is the final judgment in a criminal case is applicable only where we find that a cognizable legal right to which the appellant was plausibly entitled would be lost if appellate review were delayed\u201d; <em>State </em>v. Curcio, supra, 191 Conn. 34; and the defendant makes a \u201ccolorable <em>successive prosecution </em>double jeopardy claim.\u201d (Emphasis in original.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Crawford, </em>supra, 257 Conn. 777. In this case, the defendant\u2019s trial has concluded, and there is no risk that he will be subjected to a second prosecution. Consequently, he will not suffer irreparable harm if appellate review is postponed until after his sentence is imposed. We therefore conclude that the court\u2019s denial of the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss is not an appealable final judgment, and this court does not have jurisdiction to entertain the defendant\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b780-7\">Both charges arose from a robbery that occurred on September 22, 2005, at a Citgo gasoline station in Berlin. The robbery was recorded by a surveillance camera.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b780-8\"> The court also granted the state\u2019s motion to join a hearing on violation of probation charges brought against the defendant that arose from the same incident. The court indicated that it would proceed with the violation of probation hearing after the jury began to deliberate on count one.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b780-9\"> The defendant argued that when the jury found him not guilty of robbery, it necessarily must have found that he was not the person in the surveillance video holding a pistol.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b781-8\"> On April 2, 2009, the state moved to dismiss the defendant\u2019s appeal, arguing that the denial of the defendant\u2019s motion was not an appealable final judgment. On June 10,2009, this court denied the state\u2019s motion without prejudice and ordered the parties to brief the issue along with the merits of their respective claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b781-9\"> \u201cIn a criminal case, collateral estoppel is a protection included in the fifth amendment guarantee against double jeopardy. . . . Collateral estoppel means simply that when an issue of ultimate fact has once been determined by a valid and final judgment, that issue cannot again be litigated between the same parties in any future lawsuit.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>State </em>v. <em>Knight, </em>supra, 266 Conn. 663-64.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
