Vanwhy, appeals following the habeas court\u2019s decision to decline to rule on his petition for certification to appeal from the judgment declining to rule on his petition for a writ of habeas corpus. On appeal, the petitioner claims that the court abused its discretion by refusing to rule on his petition for certification to appeal and improperly concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over his habeas petition. We reverse the judgment of the habeas court.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-11\">Our review of the record reveals the following facts and procedural history. On February 9, 2009, the petitioner, representing himself, filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus, alleging an ex post facto violation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>Specifically, the petitioner claimed that on December 31, 2007, he committed acts for which he was charged with the crime of burglary in the second degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-102.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The petitioner pleaded guilty to this charge on May 22, 2008. On September 19, 2008, he was sentenced to a total effective term of ten years incarceration suspended after four years. The petitioner alleges that at the time of his incarceration, he was advised that he would be eligible for parole after serving 50 percent of his sentence pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 2007) \u00a7 54-125a. Subsequently, the petitioner received a letter from the board of pardons and paroles<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> informing him that he would not be eligible for parole until he served 85 percent of his sentence. The petitioner claims that Public Acts, Spec. Sess., January, 2008, No. 08-1, \u00a7 5 (Spec. Sess. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>P.A. 08-1),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> which amended General Statutes (Rev. to 2007) \u00a7 54-125a<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> by increasing from 50 percent to 85 percent the portion of a sentence that persons convicted of violating \u00a7 53a-102 must serve before becoming eligible for parole, was improperly applied by the board and that it violates the ex post facto clause of the United States constitution.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>On February 10, 2009, the court declined to issue the petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 23-24 (a) (l).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Specifically, the court found that \u201c[t]he petition sets forth a claim or claims related to parole. Pursuant to the court\u2019s holding in <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Commissioner [of Correction], </em>281 Conn. 241,914 A.2d 1034 (2007), this court lacks subject matter jurisdiction where said petition concerns parole eligibility. The court finds there is no liberty interest in parole.\u201d On February 20, 2009, the petitioner filed a petition for certification to appeal. On February 23, 2009, the court declined to rule on the petition for certification to appeal pursuant to <em>Coleman </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>111 Conn. App. 138, 958 A.2d 790 (2008), cert. denied, 290 Conn. 905, 962 A.2d 793 (2009).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thereafter, the petitioner filed the present appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">To resolve the petitioner\u2019s claim, we begin by setting forth the standard of review as well as the relevant legal principles. \u201cFaced with the habeas court\u2019s denial of certification to appeal, a petitioner\u2019s first burden is to demonstrate that the habeas court\u2019s ruling constituted an abuse of discretion. ... A petitioner may establish an abuse of discretion by demonstrating that the issues are debatable among jurists of reason . . . [the] court could resolve the issues [in a different manner] . . . or . . . the questions are adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further. . . . The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>required determination may be made on the basis of the record before the habeas court and applicable legal principles. ... If the petitioner succeeds in surmounting that hurdle, the petitioner must then demonstrate that the judgment of the habeas court should be reversed on its merits. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b28-4\">\u201cIn determining whether the habeas court abused its discretion in denying the petitioner\u2019s request for certification, we necessarily must consider the merits of the petitioner\u2019s underlying claims to determine whether the habeas court reasonably determined that the petitioner\u2019s appeal was frivolous. In other words, we review the petitioner\u2019s substantive claims for the purpose of ascertaining whether those claims satisfy one or more of the three criteria identified in <em>[Lozada </em>v. Deeds, 498 U.S. 430, 432, 111 S. Ct. 860, 112 L. Ed. 2d 956 (1991)] and adopted by this court for determining the propriety of the habeas court\u2019s denial of the petition for certification. Absent such a showing by the petitioner, the judgment of the habeas court must be affirmed [and the appeal dismissed].\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Gibson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>118 Conn. App. 863,870-71,986 A.2d303 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b28-5\">On appeal, the petitioner claims that the court abused its discretion by refusing to rule on his petition for certification to appeal and improperly concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over his habeas petition. Specifically, the petitioner argues that despite the fact that he has no liberty interest in parole, the court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction is not affected when the underlying claim is based on an ex post facto violation. <em>See Baker v. Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 281 Conn. 261-62 (\u201cparole eligibility under \u00a7 54-125a does not constitute a cognizable liberty interest sufficient to invoke habeas jurisdiction\u201d); but see <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>258 Conn. 804, 786 A.2d 1091 (2002) (concluding habeas court had subject <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>matter jurisdiction to consider petitioner\u2019s ex post facto challenge to board\u2019s parole eligibility determination for sentence based on retroactive application of \u00a7 54-125a [b] [2] and [c]). The respondent, the commissioner of correction, argues that, because the petitioner failed to allege the deprivation of a liberty interest, the court properly refused to issue the writ of habeas corpus and rule on the petition for certification to appeal. We agree with the petitioner that he did not have to allege a deprivation of a liberty interest in his habeas petition to invoke the court\u2019s jurisdiction to consider a colorable ex post facto claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">We begin our analysis by noting that \u201c[o]ur Supreme Court has long held that because [a] determination regarding a trial court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law, our review is plenary. . . . Moreover, [i]t is a fundamental rule that a court may raise and review the issue of subject matter jurisdiction at any time. . . . Subject matter jurisdiction involves the authority of the court to adjudicate the type of controversy presented by the action before it. . . . [A] court lacks discretion to consider the merits of a case over which it is without jurisdiction .... The subject matter jurisdiction requirement may not be waived by any party, and also may be raised by a party, or by the court sua sponte, at any stage of the proceedings, including on appeal.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Gonzalez </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>107 Conn. App. 507, 511, 946 A.2d 252, cert. denied, 289 Conn. 902, 957 A.2d 870 (2008). Furthermore, \u201c[i]n ruling upon whether a complaint survives a motion to dismiss, a court must take the facts to be those alleged in the complaint, including those facts necessarily implied from the allegations, construing them in a manner most favorable to the pleader. ... A motion to dismiss tests, inter alia, whether, on the face of the record, the court is without jurisdiction. . . . The conclusions reached by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>the [habeas] court in its decision to dismiss the habeas petition are matters of law, subject to plenary review. . . . Thus, [w]here the legal conclusions of the court are challenged, we must determine whether they are legally and logically correct. . . and whether they find support in the facts that appear in the record.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Young </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>104 Conn. App. 188, 193, 932 A.2d 467 (2007), cert. denied, 285 Conn. 907, 942 A.2d 416 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">The court correctly noted that the petitioner\u2019s claim relates to parole and that there is no liberty interest in parole. In determining whether a court has subject matter jurisdiction over a petition for a writ of habeas corpus that alleges an ex post facto violation, such as the petitioner\u2019s, however, the appropriate inquiry \u201c[is] whether retroactive application of the change in [the] law create [s] a sufficient risk of increasing the measure of punishment attached to the covered crimes.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 258 Conn. 818. Accordingly, the petitioner did not have to allege a violation of a liberty interest for the habeas court to have subject matter jurisdiction over his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b31-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>Our Supreme Court in <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 258 Conn. 817, explained the difference in inquiry between a claim alleging \u201ca violation of [the petitioner\u2019s] rights under the ex post facto clause as opposed to the due process clause.\u201d Specifically, the court explained that \u201c[t]he United States Supreme Court has recognized that a law need not impair a vested right to violate the ex post facto prohibition. Evaluating whether a right has vested is important for claims under the Contracts [U.S. Const., art. I, \u00a7 10, cl. 1] or Due Process Clauses [U.S. Const., amends. V, XIV], which solely protect pre-existing entitlements. . . . The presence or absence of an affirmative, enforceable right is not relevant, however, to the ex post facto prohibition, which forbids the imposition of punishment more severe than the punishment assigned by law when the act to be punished occurred. Critical to relief under the Ex Post Facto Clause is not an individual\u2019s right to less punishment, but the lack of fair notice and governmental restraint when the legislature increases punishment beyond what was prescribed when the crime was consummated. Thus, even if a statute merely alters penal provisions accorded by the grace of the legislature, it violates the Clause if it is both retrospective and more onerous than the law in effect on the date of the offense.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>The appropriate inquiry to determine whether the court has subject matter jurisdiction to consider a petition alleging an ex post facto violation is whether the petitioner, in his petition for a writ of habeas corpus, alleged sufficient facts to make a colorable showing that he likely will serve more prison time as a result of the extension of his parole eligibility date\u2014from 50 percent to 85 percent of his sentence. In reviewing the record, the petitioner presupposes that there was a retroactive application of Spec. Sess. P.A. 08-1 to his situation. Specifically, the petitioner has not alleged that he was initially notified by the board that he would be eligible for parole after serving 50 percent of his sentence.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 2007) \u00a7 54-125a (b) (2), the board properly could have determined that the petitioner was not eligible for parole until he finished serving 85 percent of his sentence. Accordingly, the petitioner\u2019s ex post facto violation is based on the assumption that the board applied Spec. Sess. P.A. 08-1 to determine that he would not be eligible for parole until he finished serving 85 percent of his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b32-5\">The appropriate inquiry for the court is to evaluate the petition based on the petitioner\u2019s assumption that the board incorrectly applied Spec. Sess. P.A. 08-1 in determining his parole eligibility. We find the decision in <em>Boyd </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>96 Conn. App. 26, 898 A.2d 838, cert. denied, 280 Conn. 921, 908 A.2d 543 (2006), instructive on this issue. In <em>Boyd, </em>\u201c[t]he petitioner filed an amended petition for a writ of habeas corpus . . . claiming that the board abused its discretion when setting the date for his next parole eligibility hearing. Specifically, the petitioner argued that, at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>time of his parole revocation hearing, the board misinterpreted Public Acts 1995, No. 95-255, which amended General Statutes \u00a7 54-125a to increase the minimum time that a prisoner convicted of certain violent offenses must serve on determinate sentences before he is eligible for release on parole. The statute increased from 50 percent to 85 percent the amount of the sentence that must be served prior to parole eligibility. The petitioner asserted that the board improperly was influenced by its incorrect interpretation of that statute when it set the date for his next parole eligibility hearing and, under <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>[supra, 258 Conn. 804], and <em>Robinson v. Commissioner of Correction, </em>258 Conn. 830, 786 A.2d 1107 (2002), the cases correcting the board\u2019s interpretation of Public Acts 1995, No. 95-255, he was entitled to reconsideration so as to remove any influence of the misinterpretation.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Boyd </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>supra, 28-29. The court determined that \u201c[t]his inquiry, however, presupposes that there is retroactive application of the change in [the law] to the prisoner\u2019s situation.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 31. In <em>Boyd, </em>the court found that the habeas court\u2019s finding that the board did not use either the 50 percent or 85 percent requirement when setting the date for the petitioner\u2019s next parole eligibility hearing was supported by the record. Id., 31-32. Specifically, the petitioner\u2019s hearing date did not reflect the application of the 85 percent requirement. Id., 32. In addition, there was evidence before the court from the chairman of the board that the board\u2019s understanding of the service requirement did not influence the panel in setting the date for the petitioner\u2019s next parole eligibility hearing. Id., 29,32-33. The court also noted that \u201cunlike the letters issued to the prisoners in <em>Johnson </em>and <em>Robinson, </em>the letter sent to the petitioner documenting the results of the . . . hearing makes no statement that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>the new parole eligibility hearing date reflects use of the 85 percent requirement.\u201d Id., 33 n.8. The court concluded that \u201c[i]n light of this evidence, the [habeas] court was within its discretion to credit [the chairman of the board\u2019s] testimony and to discredit that of the petitioner. Accordingly, the petitioner has not proven that the 85 percent requirement influenced the board when it set the date for his next parole eligibility hearing.\u201d Id., 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-5\">In the present case, because the court declined to rule on the petition for a writ of habeas coxpus without a hearing, there are no facts within or outside of the record with which to evaluate the petitioner\u2019s assumption. Accordingly, it would be premature, on the record before us, to decide that the board applied General Statutes (Rev. to 2007) \u00a7 54-125a (b) (2) instead of Spec. Sess. P.A. 08-1 in determining that the petitioner was not eligible for parole until he finished serving 85 percent of his sentence. Construing the petition in the manner most favorable to the pleader, as we must, we conclude that the petitioner has alleged sufficient facts to make a colorable showing that he will likely serve more prison time as a result of the board\u2019s application of the new law than under the old law.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-6\">We conclude that the court had subject matter jurisdiction over the petitioner\u2019s habeas petition. As a result, the court abused its discretion by refusing to rule on his petition for certification to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-7\">The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded for further proceedings according to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b34-8\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b25-5\"> We note that the petitioner did not allege specifically in his petition that he was charged with the crime of burglary in the second degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-102. It is reasonable to infer from his petition that he was charged with this crime because his ex post facto violation is premised on General Statutes (Rev. to 2007) \u00a7 54-125a having been amended in 2008 to require persons convicted of having violated \u00a7 53a-102 to serve 85 percent of their sentence before becoming eligible for parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">Furthermore, the petitioner, in his prayer for relief, requested the court to \u201corder the warden or other authorized personnel to re-calculate my parole eligibility date in accordance with [\u00a7\u00a7] 54-125a and 53a-102 as they existed at the time of [the] offense (12-31-07).\u201d See <em>Young </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>104 Conn. App. 188, 193, 932 A.2d 467 (2007) (\u201c[i]n ruling upon whether a complaint survives a motion to dismiss, a court must take the facts to be those alleged in the complaint, <em>including those facts necessarily implied from the allegations, </em>construing them in a manner most favorable to the pleader\u201d [emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted]), cert. denied, 285 Conn. 907, 942 A.2d 416 (2008). Finally, the petitioner confirmed during oral argument before this court that the underlying offense is burglary in the second degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-102.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b25-7\"> We note that the board of pardons and paroles was not made a party to this action. Neither party has raised the issue of whether the board is a necessary or indispensable party. \u201c[E]ven if it is assumed that the board is a necessary or indispensable party, the failure to join the board is not a jurisdictional defect depriving the habeas court or this court of subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Robinson </em>v. <em>Commissioner of Correction, </em>258 Conn. 830, 837 n.9, 786 A.2d 1107 (2002).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b26-5\"> Public Acts, Spec.

We note that, because the Appellate Court did not reach the petitioner\u2019s ex post facto claim, that claim is not before this court, and the petitioner expressly waived that claim at oral argument before this court.
