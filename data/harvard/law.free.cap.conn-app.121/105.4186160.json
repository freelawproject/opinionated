We conclude that, because the completion date of trial was the date on which the court last heard argument on the issues of liability and damages before it rendered judgment on those issues, the trial court fully complied with \u00a7 51-183b.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-10\">The defendant, David King,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> appeals from the judgment of the trial court, rendered after a civil trial to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>the court, in favor of the plaintiff, George Taylor. On appeal, the defendant claims that (1) the court rendered its decision more than 120 days after the completion date of trial in violation of \u00a7 51-183b, (2) the court improperly allowed the testimony of an expert witness, (3) the court improperly found that he was subject to the Home Improvement Act (act), General Statutes \u00a7 20-418 et seq., (4) if he was subject to the act, the court improperly failed to find that the plaintiff (a) waived compliance with the act and (b) claimed the act in bad faith, (5) the court\u2019s findings that (a) the plaintiff did not assent to the height of the garage at issue and (b) the defendant had substantial work remaining to be done on the project were clearly erroneous, (6) the court improperly awarded damages under the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq., because the plaintiff did not plead that the harm caused by the defendant was a result of a CUTPA violation, (7) the court abused its discretion in awarding attorney\u2019s fees (a) under CUTPA and (b) for legal services provided on posttrial motions and (8) the court improperly awarded expert witness fees under CUTPA. We reverse the judgment of the trial court as to the award of expert witness fees and affirm the judgment in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">The defendant\u2019s appeal has its genesis in a construction contract dispute between the plaintiff homeowner and the defendant contractor. The trial court found the following pertinent facts. \u201cThe plaintiff purchased the property at 307 Ferry Road, Old Lyme, a basic Cape Cod style home, in December, 2003, where he lived with his significant other, Susan Kelly. In 2004, the plaintiff and Kelly decided to do a major renovation and addition to the property. Among other improvements and renovations, the work included adding a full second floor and a garage. The plaintiff had to scale plans drawn up detailing the proposed addition-renovation in August, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>2004. A1 Bond, a local excavator and friend of the Kelly family, recommended the defendant for the framing on the project. The defendant is a registered home improvement contractor with the state of Connecticut, doing business as King Building for over twenty years. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b132-6\">\u201cThe parties, including Kelly, had a meeting in mid-October, 2004, to discuss the renovation-addition project. At the meeting, the defendant represented that his crew was knowledgeable, insured and trained to handle this type of project. Subsequent to the meeting, the defendant gave the plaintiff a quote over the telephone for the discussed portion of the project, which the plaintiff accepted. The defendant commenced work on the project on October 28, 2004, a few days later. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">\u201cBy late December, 2004, the plaintiff discovered that the garage, as framed by the defendant, would not accommodate the eight foot doors contained in the building plans. Around that time, the plaintiff began to discover other deviations from the building plans, which caused him concern about the defendant\u2019s workmanship. In January, 2005, the relationship between the parties fell apart. As of January 19, 2005, the date of the last payment made by the plaintiff to the defendant, the plaintiff had paid $50,500 of the contracted amount of $52,425. Approximately only $2000 remained to be paid on the contract, although a lot of the work remained to be completed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">On December 29, 2006, the plaintiff commenced this action, alleging breach of contract, breach of warranty, negligent infliction of emotional distress, unjust enrichment and a violation of CUTPA. On March 2, 2007, the defendant answered, pleaded seven special defenses, a setoff and alleged a three count counterclaim. The presentation of evidence as to liability and damages began on March 5, 2008, and concluded on March 14, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>2008. Briefs were filed on April 22, 2008, and argument was held on May 27, 2008. On September 24, 2008, the court rendered judgment as to liability and damages in favor of the plaintiff on all counts, found that the defendant failed to meet his burden of proof with respect to each count of his counterclaim and awarded the plaintiff damages of $110,000 (first decision).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court deferred the issues of punitive damages, attorney\u2019s fees and costs awardable under CUTPA until a later hearing. Following the filing of supplemental briefs and a hearing on the plaintiffs motion for punitive damages, attorney\u2019s fees and costs, the court, on March 30, 2009, rendered its decision as to punitive damages, attorney\u2019s fees and costs. The court declined to award punitive damages but awarded the plaintiff $50,498.08 for attorney\u2019s fees and $3880.58 for costs (second decision). This appeal followed. Additional facts will be set forth as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">The defendant\u2019s first claim on appeal is that the court rendered judgment more than 120 days after the completion date of trial in violation of \u00a7 51-183b. Specifically, he argues that the completion date of trial was April 22, 2008, more than 120 days prior to the court\u2019s issuing its first decision regarding liability and damages, that the court could not have opened the case and that the case was not still open on October 21, 2008, and, even if October 21, 2008, represents the completion date of trial, the court nonetheless violated \u00a7 51-183b by not rendering its decision regarding punitive damages, attorney\u2019s fees and costs until March 30,2009. The plaintiff argues that the completion date of trial was January 12, 2009, and also that the defendant consented to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>delay by not filing an objection with the court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Because we conclude that the completion date of trial was May 27,2008, and that the court\u2019s September 24,2008 memorandum of decision represented a judgment for purposes of \u00a7 51-183b, the court complied with the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">The following facts are relevant for the resolution of the defendant\u2019s claim. The presentation of evidence began on March 5,2008, and lasted until March 14,2008, at which time the court requested that briefs be filed and argued. Briefs were filed on April 22, 2008, argument was held on May 27, 2008,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the court issued its first decision as to liability and damages on September 24, 2008. The court found in favor of the plaintiff but made no ruling on September 24,2008, as to punitive damages, attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">On October 21, 2008, the court held a hearing on the issue of punitive damages, at which time the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>suggested that it could open the case, or that the case was still open, as to the issues of punitive damages, attorney\u2019s fees and costs because evidence on those issues was not complete and that it had not rendered final judgment for purposes of appeal. The defendant filed a supplemental brief regarding punitive damages, attorney\u2019s fees and costs on October 27,2008. The plaintiff filed his brief on October 31, 2008, and Ann Grun-beck Monaghan, the plaintiffs counsel, filed her affidavit of attorney\u2019s fees on November 3, 2008. At some time in January, 2009, fewer than 120 days prior to the issuance of the second decision on March 30, 2009, an argument regarding the plaintiffs motion to compel and for attorney\u2019s fees, dated December 1,2008, took place before the court. Thereafter, on March 30, 2009, the court issued its decision as to punitive damages, attorney\u2019s fees and costs, awarding $50,498.08 for attorney\u2019s fees and $3880.58 for costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">The defendant first argues that the completion date of trial was April 22, 2008, the date posttrial briefs were filed and more than 120 days prior to the court\u2019s issuing its first decision.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The plaintiff counters that January 12, 2009, was the completion date of trial, as that was the date of the final argument prior to the court\u2019s issuing its second, and final, decision. We conclude that both parties have missed the mark and that the completion date of trial for purposes of \u00a7 51-183b was May 27,2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>Section 51-183b provides in relevant part: \u201cAny judge of the Superior Court . . . who has commenced the trial of any civil cause . . . shall render judgment not later than one hundred and twenty days from the <em>completion date of the trial of such civil cause. . . </em>.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In construing this phrase, our Supreme Court has stated: \u201cIn determining that \u2018the completion date\u2019 includes the filing of briefs, the trial court held that briefing of the legal issues was a component of the judicial gathering of the materials necessary to a well-reasoned decision. In related contexts, \u2018completion\u2019 has been held to encompass the availability of all the elements directly or indirectly to be considered in the rendering of a decision. See <em>Bankamerica Corporation </em>v. <em>Board of Governors, </em>596 F.2d 1368, 1378 (9th Cir. 1979); <em>Lloyd </em>v. <em>Illinois Regional Transportation Authority, </em>548 F. Sup. 575, 590 (N.D. Ill.1982).\u201d <em>Frank </em>v. <em>Streeter, </em>192 Conn. 601, 604, 472 A.2d 1281 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">Although the appellant did not provide a transcript for the May 27, 2008 hearing; see Practice Book \u00a7 61-10 (appellant responsible for providing adequate record for review); both parties agree that they appeared before the court that day and engaged in argument. The plaintiff claims that the parties were able \u201cto make closing arguments and to address the legal issues presented at trial.\u201d The defendant characterizes the hearing as an opportunity \u201cto provide (only) argument\u201d and notes that \u201cno evidence was then taken . . . .\u201d Regardless of whether evidence was taken, and despite the fact that the case law cited by both parties considers the filing of posttrial briefs as the completion of trial, there can be no doubt that the hearing could be \u201cconsidered in the rendering of a decision.\u201d <em>Frank </em>v. <em>Streeter, </em>supra, 192 Conn. 604. Neither party, nor we, could find a case in which this issue was decided with respect to argument following the filing of posttrial briefs. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>Because it is unquestionable that this postbrief argument could be considered in the court\u2019s decision, however, we conclude that, under the circumstances of this case, May 27, 2008, was the completion date of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">The defendant does not dispute that the court\u2019s first decision was issued within 120 days of the parties\u2019 May 27, 2008 argument. He argues alternatively, however, that the court violated \u00a7 51-183b by not rendering its final judgment until March 30, 2009, over 120 days from the completion date of trial.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Even if we assume that this argument is viable given our decision that May 27, 2008, was the completion date, we note that the argument is based on a misapprehension of the term \u201cjudgment.\u201d The defendant misconstrues the term judgment as it is used in \u00a7 51-183b with the concept of a final judgment for purposes of appeal.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Because \u00a7 51-183b requires only a judgment within 120 days of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>completion date of trial, and the first decision represented a judgment on the merits of the case, the court complied with the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">Section 51-183b provides in relevant part: \u201cAny judge of the Superior Court . . . who has commenced the trial of any civil cause . . . shall render <em>judgment </em>not later than one hundred and twenty days from the completion date of the trial of such civil cause. . . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) This court previously has determined that a court\u2019s judgment of strict foreclosure that did not set law days was a judgment for purposes of \u00a7 51-183b, even though the judgment was not final for purposes of appeal. \u201cAlthough the trial court\u2019s judgment was not final for purposes of an appeal, it fulfilled the trial court\u2019s statutory obligation to render a judgment within 120 days after the conclusion of the trial.\u201d <em>L &amp; R Realty </em>v. <em>Connecticut National </em>Bank, 53 Conn. App. 524, 548, 732 A.2d 181, cert. denied, 250 Conn. 901, 734 A.2d 984 (1999). The decision of this court in <em>L &amp; R Realty </em>reveals that the statute is intended to set a time limit for a court to render a judgment on the merits of a case, not to set a deadline for the court to issue a final judgment for purposes of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">The theory that \u00a7 51-183b is meant only to impact the time frame in which a court must render judgment is bolstered by our Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of the purpose of General Statutes (Rev. to 1972) \u00a7 51-29,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> the predecessor statute to \u00a7 51-183b. In <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Feldman, </em>164 Conn. 554, 325 A.2d 247 (1973), the court stated: \u201cThe statute was designed to ensure that, in a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>case tried to the court, the judge consider and decide the controversy expeditiously and within a reasonably brief period after trial. . . . The salutary effect of the statute is to compel diligence and a prompt decision on the part of the judge who tried the case, and to avoid the manifest disadvantages attendant on long delay in rendering judgment. On the other hand, however, judicial economy dictates that the parties will be deemed to have consented to the delay if they fail to take timely and appropriate advantage of it. . . . Thus the statute . . . attempts to balance judicial expediency with fairness to the parties and to reduce delays over which counsel have little, if any, control.\u201d (Citations omitted.) Id., 556-57; see also <em>Matthews </em>v. <em>Nagy Bros. Construction Co., </em>88 Conn. App. 787, 792, 871 A.2d 1067 (applying rationale of <em>Gordon </em>to \u00a7 51-183b), cert. denied, 274 Conn. 907, 876 A.2d 1199 (2005). Section 51-183b is in place to ensure action on the part of the court in deciding the merits of the case, not to guarantee that the losing party will have a final judgment from which to appeal within 120 days of the completion of trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">Here, the court issued its first decision within 120 days from the completion of trial. In that memorandum of decision, the court rendered judgment on the merits of the case in favor of the plaintiff on all counts, found that the defendant failed to meet his burden of proof with respect to each count of his counterclaim and awarded the plaintiff damages of $110,000. Although the court sought an additional hearing on the issues of punitive damages, attorney\u2019s fees and costs, the first decision constituted a judgment for the purposes of \u00a7 51-183b. The court could not have decided the issues of punitive damages, attorney\u2019s fees and costs because those issues were not argued or briefed in the parties\u2019 posttrial briefs. It was not until after the merits of the case were decided that the parties submitted their supplemental briefs regarding punitive damages, attorney\u2019s fees and costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>We recognize that our conclusion leads to an outcome in which, so long as a trial court decides a case on its merits within 120 days but defers deciding other ancillary issues such as punitive damages, attorney\u2019s fees and costs, there is no statutory time limit within which it must decide those ancillary issues. As our Supreme Court has stated, however: \u201cDelay in the trial courts is not remedied by affording disappointed litigants automatic access to new trials whenever the just resolution of their cases requires time for study and reflection.\u201d <em>Frank </em>v. <em>Streeter, </em>supra, 192 Conn. 605. Although the structure of this trial delayed the rendering of a final judgment for purposes of appeal until nearly one year after the filing of posttrial briefs; see <em>Perkins </em>v. <em>Colonial Cemeteries, Inc., </em>53 Conn. App. 646, 649, 734 A.2d 1010 (1999) (judgment not final for purposes of appeal until issue of CUTPA punitive damages has been resolved); the court properly complied with the statutory obligation set forth by \u00a7 51-183b.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-6\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b140-7\">The defendant next claims that the court improperly allowed the plaintiff to present the testimony of an expert witness, Brian Jermainne. Specifically, he contends that because Jermainne was not a real estate appraiser within the definition provided in General Statutes \u00a7 20-500 (10), he was legally incapable of testifying as to the fair market value of the plaintiffs home or the diminution in value of the property as a result of the work done by the defendant. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-8\">On September 26,2007, the plaintiff filed a disclosure of expert witnesses with the court. The plaintiff disclosed that he intended to call two experts, Stephen Spurrell and Jermainne. Spurrell was to testify that the work done by the defendant was not completed according to the architect\u2019s specifications or to industry <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>standards. Jermainne was to testify about the diminution in value of the plaintiffs home as a result of the work done by the defendant. The defendant objected to the disclosure of the expert witnesses and moved to preclude their testimony. The court overruled the objection and denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Jermainne testified at trial on March 6, 2008. He explained that he had been a Realtor for eight years and held numerous designations, including certified residential specialist, accredited buyer representative, accredited seller representative and a graduate of Realtor Institute. On the basis of his expertise and experience, Jermainne estimated that had the construction been completed according to the plans, the value of the house would have been between $900,000 and $925,000 but that as a result of the work that was done, the value of the house was likely between $800,000 and $825,000.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">\u201cThe trial court has wide discretion in ruling on the qualification of expert witnesses and the admissibility of their opinions. . . . The court\u2019s decision is not to be disturbed unless [its] discretion has been abused, or the error is clear and involves a misconception of the law.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Hutchinson </em>v. <em>Andover, </em>49 Conn. App. 781, 788, 715 A.2d 831 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">General Statutes \u00a7 20-501 (a) provides in relevant part: \u201cNo person shall act as a real estate appraiser or provisional appraiser or engage in the real estate appraisal business without the appropriate certification, license, limited license or provisional license issued by the commission . . . .\u201d Section 20-500 (10) defines a \u201creal estate appraiser\u201d as \u201ca person engaged in the business of estimating the value of real estate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>for a fee or other valuable consideration,\u201d and \u00a7 20-500 (5) defines \u201cengaging in the real estate appraisal business\u201d as \u201cthe act or process of estimating the value of real estate for a fee or other valuable consideration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">\u201cSection 20-501 is a licensing statute and does not preclude a witness from testifying as to his opinion of the diminution in value of the plaintiffs property, where the trial court found that the witness\u2019 education, training and experience qualified him to testify as an expert . . . .\u201d <em>Hutchinson </em>v. <em>Andover, </em>supra, 49 Conn. App. 789. Furthermore, \u00a7 20-500 (5) does not include testifying as to the value of property or diminution in value of certain property within the definition of \u201cengaging in the real estate appraisal business.\u201d The court did not abuse its discretion in admitting Jermainne\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">The defendant also claims that the court improperly found that he was subject to the act. He argues that the plaintiff was the general contractor and that he was merely a subcontractor on the construction project. On that basis, he argues that he falls beyond the scope of the act.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">Before addressing the merits of the defendant\u2019s claim, we first must determine the applicable standard of review. The question of whether a home improvement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>service provider is acting as a contractor or a subcontractor is one of fact. <em>Meadows </em>v. <em>Higgins, </em>249 Conn. 155, 168, 171-72, 733 A.2d 172 (1999). \u201cThus, our review of the trial court\u2019s determination of that issue is limited by the deference we afford factual findings. A finding of fact will not be disturbed unless it is clearly erroneous in view of the evidence and pleadings in the whole record. ... A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it . . . or when although there is evidence to support it, the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. ... In applying the clearly erroneous standard to the findings of a trial court, we keep constantly in mind that our function is not to decide factual issues de novo. Our authority, when reviewing the findings of a judge, is circumscribed by the deference we must give to decisions of the trier of fact, who is usually in a superior position to appraise and weigh the evidence. . . . The question for this court ... is not whether it would have made the findings the trial court did, but whether in view of the evidence and pleadings in the whole record it is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>MJM Landscaping, Inc. </em>v. <em>Lorant, </em>268 Conn. 429, 436-37, 845 A.2d 382 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">In his brief, the defendant supports his claim by arguing that the plaintiff (1) set the scope of the project by obtaining and modifying plans, (2) borrowed more money for the project than was necessary to pay for the defendant\u2019s share, (3) took out a building permit for the defendant\u2019s work, (4) hired, paid and supervised other parties, whom the defendant characterizes as subcontractors, including, but not limited to, someone to do the concrete work, someone to install a pool, and a plumber, and (5) paid for materials from a supply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>house on his own account. The plaintiffs role is not the relevant inquiry in resolving this claim. We must determine whether it was clearly erroneous for the court to have found that the defendant was a contractor, as contemplated by the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">The court made the following findings of fact concerning this issue. \u201cOn or about November 13 or 14, 2004, two weeks after the defendant\u2019s work had commenced, the defendant presented the plaintiff with a written contract. The contract provides, in material part, that the defendant is to complete the following construction work: \u2018[RJemove existing rear porch and house roof. Provide concrete foundation for the new garage, retaining wall, rear utility space and front porch sonatube\u2019s. Frame new roof, front porch, rear addition, and garage as per plan. Install trim on facia and rake\u2019s only. Shingle all new roofs.\u2019 The contract further provides that the estimated time for completion for the project is ten weeks from the start date. With regard to the cost for [the] project, the contract provides as follows: $52,425 in carpentry labor, $8325 for concrete work and $100/square for the shingling of the roofs. The written contract further provides that, in addition to the workmanlike performance of the work stated above, the defendant shall be responsible for providing an excavating contractor for $5100. With regard to the payment terms, the contract states that the stipulated contract price shall be paid as a weekly draw based on the percentage of completion, with checks to be made payable to [the defendant]. In addition, the contract states that it is the entire agreement between the parties, that it may only be altered in writing and that the homeowner has seventy-two hours after signing the agreement to cancel. The contract was never signed by either party. There was no further description of the work to be completed by the defendant at the plaintiffs residence, nor did the contract specify how changes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>would be addressed other than to state that any alterations to the agreement must be in writing. The contract did not contain the defendant\u2019s address or his registration identification with the state of Connecticut department of consumer protection. The defendant did not give the plaintiff notice of his cancellation rights prior to commencing work on the project. Furthermore, in the text of the contract, which the defendant drafted, the defendant refers to himself as \u2018contractor.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">\u201cNeither party raised the issue of a signed contract while the work was ongoing. The roof, the original second floor and the kitchen were removed in the early stages of construction. Although the plaintiff and Kelly lived in the premises during construction and monitored the work as it progressed, the defendant was in charge of the work site. Despite numerous changes from the original plans, the defendant never documented in writing any change orders or associated costs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">As an initial matter, it is important to note that the defendant does not have to be a <em>general </em>contractor to fall within the purview of the act. Rather, the act requires only that he be a <em>contractor </em>as opposed to a <em>subcontractor. </em>See General Statutes \u00a7 20-418 et seq.; <em>Meadows </em>v. <em>Higgins, </em>supra, 249 Conn. 167. A review of the record reveals that there can be no doubt that the defendant acted as a contractor for this home improvement project. He had a contract with the plaintiff, not another contractor,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> for the work that was to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>be done, and that contract even referred to him as a contractor. He was paid directly by the plaintiff for the work he completed, not by another contractor. The record supports the court\u2019s conclusion that the defendant was a contractor and, accordingly, was bound by the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">Next, the defendant claims that, if he was subject to the act, the court improperly failed to find that the plaintiff (1) waived compliance with the act and (2) claimed the act in bad faith. Specifically, he argues that the plaintiff failed to sign the contract and now seeks to avoid having to pay for the work done by asserting noncompliance with the act. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">The defendant first argues that the plaintiff waived the requirements of General Statutes (Rev. to 2003) \u00a7 20-429 when he failed to sign the contract. General Statutes (Rev. to 2003) \u00a7 20-429 (a) provides: \u201cNo home improvement contract shall be valid or enforceable against an owner unless it: (1) Is in writing, (2) is signed by the owner and the contractor, (3) contains the entire agreement between the owner and the contractor, (4) contains the date of the transaction, (5) contains the name and address of the contractor, (6) contains a notice of the owner\u2019s cancellation rights in accordance with the provisions of chapter 740, (7) contains a starting date and completion date, and (8) is entered into by a registered salesman or registered contractor. Each change in the terms and conditions of a contract shall be in writing and shall be signed by the owner and contractor, except that the commissioner may, by regulation, dispense with the necessity for complying with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>the requirement that each change in a home improvement contract shall be in writing and signed by the owner and contractor.\u201d The defendant contends that he complied with the \u201csalient portions\u201d of this section and that the plaintiffs failure to sign the contract should be construed as a waiver of the act\u2019s protections. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">In addressing a similar claim, our Supreme Court has said: \u201cClearly, the legislature is entitled, in the first instance, to impose the burden of compliance with the statute on the professional, the contractor, rather than on the nonprofessional, the consumer. . . . The objective of the act is to promote understanding by the consumer, to ensure his ability to make an informed decision and to protect him from substantial work by an unscrupulous contractor.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Habetz </em>v. <em>Condon, </em>224 Conn. 231, 239, 618 A.2d 501 (1992). Under the facts of this case, the plaintiff cannot be held responsible for the defendant\u2019s failure to comply with the act. The defendant, after presenting the plaintiff with the contract, did not again demand that the plaintiff sign the contract before proceeding with the work. He also violated other provisions of General Statutes (Rev. to 2003) \u00a7 20-429 (a) by not giving notice of the plaintiffs cancellation rights before beginning work and by not including his address. Furthermore, the defendant never documented any changes from the original plan in writing. The defendant failed to comply with the act, and the fact that the contract was not signed by <em>either </em>party is not evidence that the plaintiff waived compliance with the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">The defendant also argues that the court should have found that the plaintiff acted in bad faith by entering into the agreement, not signing the contract and now seeking protection by claiming that the defendant failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>to comply with the act. As noted previously, the defendant did not comply with the act, and there is nothing in the record to suggest that the plaintiffs claiming the act was done in bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">The defendant seeks support from our Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Habetz </em>v. <em>Condon, </em>supra, 224 Conn. 231. There, Peter Habetz, Jr., the plaintiff homeowner, requested that work in addition to the original contract be performed but never signed the proposal despite repeated requests to do so by Ken Condon, the defendant contractor. Id., 233. The plaintiff refused to pay the money owed for this extra performance and brought an action, claiming breach of contract due to defective, improper and negligent work, breach of the statutory requirements of the act, violation of CUTPA and negligence resulting in his sustaining emotional distress and financial loss. Id., 234. Condon filed a counterclaim in two counts, alleging that Habetz failed to pay $10,000 owed under the written, signed contract and failed to pay for the extras that Condon had performed at Habetz\u2019 request. Id. Habetz asserted the special defenses that the writing requirements of the act, as well as General Statutes \u00a7 42-135a, the notice provision of the Home Solicitation Sales Act; General Statutes \u00a7 42-134a et seq.; had not been satisfied. <em>Habetz </em>v. <em>Condon, </em>supra, 234. In his answer, the defendant denied the statutory violations. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">The court stated that \u201ca contractor, otherwise precluded from recovering moneys owed for his work because of a violation of the act, must be permitted to assert that the homeowner\u2019s bad faith precludes him from safely repudiating the contract and hiding behind the act in order to bar the contractor\u2019s recovery.\u201d Id., 238. It continued: \u201cTo deny the contractor any opportunity of recovery after he has completed his end of the bargain if he has persuaded the trier of fact that a statutory remedy is being invoked by a homeowner in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>bad faith would be to countenance a gross injustice and indeed to encourage its perpetuation and to assure its success.\u201d Id., 240. The court then affirmed the trial court\u2019s finding in favor of Habetz on his breach of contract claim and Condon\u2019s counterclaim of bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">The present case is distinguishable from <em>Habetz. </em>As an initial matter, as noted previously, the defendant\u2019s noncompliance with the act was not merely the failure to have a signed contract. In this case, the defendant did not comply with several other portions of General Statutes (Rev. to 2003) \u00a7 20-429. Also, there is no evidence that he ever asked the plaintiff about signing the contract after he gave it to him initially. Additionally, the evidence in this case does not indicate that the plaintiff merely was seeking to avoid paying for the defendant\u2019s work but, rather, that the defendant\u2019s work was substandard and reduced the anticipated value of the house by approximately $100,000. The fact that the plaintiff did not sign the contract is not a sufficient basis for us to conclude that the court improperly failed to find that the plaintiff claimed the act in bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">The defendant also claims that the court\u2019s findings that (1) the plaintiff did not assent to the height of the garage and (2) the defendant had substantial work remaining on the project were clearly erroneous. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">\u201cAppellate review of a trial court\u2019s findings of fact is governed by the clearly erroneous standard of review. The trial court\u2019s findings are binding upon this court unless they are clearly erroneous in light of the evidence and the pleadings in the record as a whole. . . . We cannot retry the facts or pass on the credibility of the witnesses. ... A finding of fact is clearly erroneous when there is no evidence in the record to support it ... or when although there is evidence to support it, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>the reviewing court on the entire evidence is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. . . . The court, as the sole arbiter of credibility, is free to accept or reject, in whole or in part, the testimony offered by either party.\u201d (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Blacker </em>v. <em>Crapo, </em>112 Conn. App. 795, 804-805, 964 A.2d 1241, cert. denied, 291 Conn. 915, 970 A.2d 727 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">The following additional facts are relevant for the resolution of the defendant\u2019s claim. In December, 2008, the plaintiff realized that the garage had been framed improperly and would not accommodate the planned eight foot tall garage doors. When he brought this to the attention of the defendant and asked him if he had referred to the plans, the defendant responded that he had not. The defendant offered to cut into the header that supported the second story in order to accommodate the eight foot tall garage doors.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-8\">At trial, Spurrell, the plaintiffs construction expert, testified that the problems with the garage door height began with the concrete work that was done and that according to the construction contract, the defendant was responsible for the concrete work. The incorrect concrete work led to there not being sufficient room for the eight foot tall garage doors.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-9\">The defendant now contends that it was the excavation, completed by Bond, not the defendant, which set the height of the garage, not the concrete work, as Spurrell opined. He further argues, as he testified at trial, that the plaintiff assented to the height of the garage after Bond expressed concerns that water would seep into the garage unless the garage floor was raised. The court explicitly credited Spurrell\u2019s testimony. On the basis of the court\u2019s findings regarding this testimony, as well as the plaintiffs own testimony, there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>sufficient evidence in the record for us to conclude that the court did not improperly find that the plaintiff did not assent to the height of the garage.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">The defendant also claims that the court improperly found that there was substantial work remaining to be done on the project. He argues that he was excused from completing work on the project when the plaintiff breached their contract by not paying the bill dated January 27, 2005. The defendant seems to ignore the fact that he admitted on cross-examination that he had not completed a number of items when he left the job, including the installation of windows, doors, roof shingles and trim, and additional work to the back porch and joists. It is also noteworthy that the court, in its first decision, stated: \u201cThe defendant is not credible in his testimony as to the last day he worked on the plaintiffs house or to the extent of the work he performed, either in fulfillment of the original contract or as to the extras.\u201d As the court was in the better position to determine credibility; see <em>Gallo-Mure </em>v. <em>Tomchik, </em>78 Conn. App. 699, 715, 829 A.2d 8 (2003) (trial court better able to determine issues of credibility because it observes demeanor of witnesses, and appellate courts have only dry record of testimony); and on the basis of the evidence in the record, we cannot conclude that the court improperly found that the defendant had substantial work remaining on the project.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">The defendant also appears to claim that the court improperly awarded damages under CUTPA because the plaintiff did not plead that the harm caused by the defendant was a result of a violation of CUTPA, namely, the failure to have contract to comply with the terms of General Statutes (Rev. to 2003) \u00a7 20-429. We decline to review this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>In Ms brief, the defendant argues: \u201cThe trial court found that [the] defendant had violated CUTPA by not havMg a contract in compliance with the [act] .... As the case was pleaded by [the] plaintiff, no damages can be awarded under CUTPA.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">\u201cCase law has also established that even an undisputed or per se violation of the [act] by means of a contract not complying with the requirements of [\u00a7 20-429] would not be grounds, without more, for the award of damages. . . . [E]ven with a per se violation, there is still a need to determme that the violation (as compared to somethmg else) caused the harm, a harm, we contend, that had to have been pleaded.\u201d (Citations omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">We are unable to make sense of the defendant\u2019s claim. It appears that the defendant is contestmg the court\u2019s awardmg of pumtive damages. The court, however, dechned to award pumtive damages because \u201cthere is nothing m the record that mdicates an mtention on the defendant\u2019s part to do \u2018wanton and malicious injury\u2019 to the plaintiff.\u201d Because the defendant\u2019s brief is unclear as to how the legal principles he cites apply to the case at hand, we consider tMs claim madequately briefed and declme to afford it review. See, e.g., <em>Ruggiero </em>v. <em>Pellicci, </em>294 Conn. 473, 481 n.5, 987 A.2d 339 (2010) (claim madequately briefed when no attempt made to apply black letter law to facts of present case).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-8\">VII</p>\n<p id=\"b152-9\">Next, the defendant claims that the court abused its discretion in awardmg attorney\u2019s fees (1) under CUTPA and (2) for work done on posttrial motions. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-10\">\u201cAwardmg . . . attorney\u2019s fees under CUTPA is discretionary; General Statutes \u00a7 42-1 lOg (a) and (d) . . . and the exercise of such discretion will not ordinarily be mterfered with on appeal unless the abuse is manifest or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>injustice appears to have been done.\u201d (Internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>MedValUSA Health Programs, Inc. </em>v. <em>MemberWorks, Inc., </em>109 Conn. App. 308, 315, 951 A.2d 26 (2008). \u201cThis standard applies to the amount of fees awarded . . . and also to the trial court\u2019s determination of the factual predicate justifying the award. . . . Under the abuse of discretion standard of review, [w]e will make every reasonable presumption in favor of upholding the trial court\u2019s ruling, and only upset it for a manifest abuse of discretion. . . . [Thus, our] review of such rulings is limited to the questions of whether the trial court correctly applied the law and reasonably could have reached the conclusion that it did.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Schoonmaker </em>v. <em>Lawrence Brunoli, Inc., </em>265 Conn. 210, 252-53, 828 A.2d 64 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b153-7\">The defendant argues that the court abused its discretion by awarding the plaintiff attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 42-1 lOg not only for services provided on the CUTPA claim but for all services provided on the case. He cites <em>Jacques All Trades Corp. </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>57 Conn. App. 189, 200, 752 A.2d 1098 (2000), for the proposition that \u201c[i]n the absence of abuse of discretion, the court can award attorney\u2019s fees under CUTPA only for those expenses that were related to the prosecution of a CUTPA claim.\u201d The plaintiff argues that a case decided subsequent to <em>Jacques All Trades Corp. </em>holds that when the facts underlying the CUTPA claim are indistinguishable from those facts relating to other claims, \u201c\u00a7 42-1 lOg (d) encompasses claims related to the prosecution of a CUTPA claim . . . not only one claim explicitly labeled as a CUTPA claim.\u201d <em>Heller </em>v. <em>D. W. Fish Realty Co., </em>93 Conn. App. 727, 735, 890 A.2d 113 (2006). We agree with the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b153-8\">Section 42-1 lOg (d) provides in relevant part: \u201cIn any action brought by a person under this section, the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>may award, to the plaintiff, in addition to the relief provided in this section, costs and reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees based on the work reasonably performed by an attorney and not on the amount of recovery. ...\u201d In addressing the issue of attorney\u2019s fees, the court stated: <em>\u201cAsm Heller, </em>the plaintiffs claims of breach of contract, breach of warranty, negligent infliction of emotional distress and violation of the [act]-CUTPA depend on the same facts and circumstances. The court finds that apportioning the attorney\u2019s fees based on the [act]-CUTPA claim alone would be impermissibly difficult, as the facts and circumstances which gave rise to the other claims all related to the [act]-CUTPA violations, and all of [the] plaintiff\u2019s claims arose out of the home improvement activities performed by the defendant, as defined by the [act].\u201d We conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion but, rather, correctly applied the law as stated in <em>Heller </em>to the facts of this case and arrived at a reasonable conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-6\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b154-7\">The defendant also argues that the court abused its discretion in awarding attorney\u2019s fees for services provided on posttrial motions. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-8\">As noted by the court, our Supreme Court recently addressed a similar claim and held: \u201cIt [is] within the trial court\u2019s discretion to award additional fees on the supplemental motion for work on posttrial motions after that date.\u201d <em>Stokes </em>v. <em>Norwich Taxi, LLC, </em>289 Conn. 465, 494, 958 A.2d 1195 (2008). The record establishes that the plaintiff\u2019s posttrial brief clearly indicated that it was intended to seek recovery for attorney\u2019s fees and costs in full. It was within the court\u2019s discretion to award additional fees on the supplemental motion for work on posttrial motions after that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>VIII</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">The defendant\u2019s final claim is that the court improperly awarded expert witness fees under CUTPA. We agree and reverse the court\u2019s awarding of those fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">This court recently addressed this issue in <em>Centimark Corp. </em>v. <em>Village Manor Associates Ltd. Partnership, </em>113 Conn. App. 509, 967 A.2d 550, cert. denied, 292 Conn. 907, 973 A.2d 103 (2009). \u201cIt is a settled principle of our common law that parties are required to bear their own litigation expenses, except as otherwise provided by statute. . . .</p>\n<p id=\"b155-7\"><em>\u201cMiller </em>[v. <em>Guimaraes, </em>78 Conn. App. 760, 829 A.2d 422 (2003)] is dispositive of this issue. In that case, [this court] held that the trial court\u2019s award to homeowners of $1000 as taxable costs for an expert who was an attorney was improper in an action to recover damages under CUTPA because there was no statutory authority under General Statutes \u00a7 52-260 for such an award. . . . [Section] 52-260, relating to witness fees, sets forth the court\u2019s authority to award expert witness fees in civil litigation. Within the statute, there is an enumeration of the categories of experts entitled to a discretionary award of expert witness fees. . . . Expert witness fees for roofing consulting firms are not included within that enumeration.\u201d (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) <em>Centimark Corp. </em>v. <em>Village Manor Associates Ltd. Partnership, </em>supra, 113 Conn. App. 540-41. Similarly, \u00a7 52-260 does not provide expert witness fees for construction experts.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Accordingly, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>conclude that the court\u2019s awarding the plaintiff expert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>witness fees for Spurrell, the plaintiffs construction expert, was improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">The judgment is reversed only as to the award of expert witness fees and the case is remanded with direction to vacate that award. The judgment is affirmed in all other respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b130-11\"> General Statutes \u00a7 51-183b provides: \u201cAny judge of the Superior Court and any judge trial referee who has the power to render judgment, who has commenced the trial of any civil cause, shall have power to continue such trial and shall render judgment not later than one hundred and twenty days from the completion date of the trial of such civil cause.

The plaintiff characterized the proceeding as an opportunity for \u201cclosing statements and argument . . . .\u201d Although the defendant did not provide us with a transcript of this court proceeding, both parties represent that a proceeding occurred and that argument was given, which is sufficient for our evaluation of this claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b135-6\"> The defendant argues that Practice Book \u00a7 11-19 supports his position.

In the event that the judge or referee conducts a hearing on the matter and/or the parties file briefs concerning it, the date of submission for purposes of this section shall be the date the matter is heard or the date the last brief ordered by the court is filed, whichever occurs later. . . .\u201d Although this section is instructive, this case does not involve a short calendar matter, and, thus, our conclusion is based on other relevant legal principles.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b137-6\"> The defendant argues that if the case was still open on October 21,2008, or if the court opened the case on that day, this marked the completion date of trial, and the court did not render judgment until March 30, 2009, more than 120 days later. The record presented to us by the defendant does not make clear what occurred after the October 21, 2008 hearing. See Practice Book \u00a7 61-10 (\u201c[i]t is the responsibility of the appellant to provide an adequate record for review\u201d). The parties present differing accounts of what occurred between October 21, 2008, and the court\u2019s issuing of its second decision on March 30,2009. Without being able to determine conclusively what occurred after October 21, 2008, we would not be in a position to determine what day represents the completion date of trial on the basis of the defendant\u2019s alternate theory and therefore would be unable to determine whether the second decision was issued within 120 days of an unknown date.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b137-7\"> The defendant looks for support from <em>Paranteau </em>v. <em>DeVita, </em>208 Conn. 515, 544 A.2d 634 (1988), and its progeny.

General Statutes \u00a7 20-419 (3) defines a \u201ccontractor\u201d as \u201cany person who owns and operates a home improvement business or who undertakes, offers to undertake or agrees to perform any home improvement. . . .\u201d On the basis of this definition, the plaintiff contends that it is clear that the defendant is a contractor because he agreed to peifoim home improvement on the plaintiffs house. Although this argument is logical and supported by the record, because our Supreme Court has held that the determination of whether a home improvement service provider is acting as a contractor or a subcontractor is a question of fact; see <em>Meadows </em>v. <em>Higgins, </em>249 Conn. 155, 171-72, 733 A.2d 172 (1999); we must review the factual findings of the trial court..</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b145-7\"> The defendant cites to Superior Court cases that stand for the proposition that a homeowner can be his own general contractor, and, thus, the people with whom he contracts are his subcontractors; <em>Verrico </em>v. <em>Dudek, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Stamford-Norwalk, Docket No. CV-01-0187006 (February 15, 2002); <em>McClain </em>v. <em>Byers, </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Fairfield, Docket No. CV-93-0301761-S (May 6, 1997) (19 Conn. L. Rptr. 400); and the plaintiff cites to cases holding the opposite. <em>Victory </em>v. <em>Morris Construction Co., </em>Superior Court, judicial district of StamfordNorwalk, Docket No. CV-96-0152254 (April 7, 1998); <em>Fromm </em>v. <em>FAS Designer &amp; Builders, Inc., </em>Superior Court, judicial district of Stamford-Norwalk, Docket No. CV-97-0160094 (March 16, 1998) (21 Conn. L. Rptr. 494). It does not appear that this issue has been addressed by an appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>court in this state.
