B. R. Burroughs, Judge, presiding.</summary><summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b488-3\" pgmap=\"488(323) 489(58)\">This is an action brought by the City of East St. Louis for the use of John Dowd against John W. Renshaw, city treasurer of that city, and his sureties upon the official bond of said Renshaw, as such city treasurer. The declaration avers, that the bond, which was in the penal sum of $100,000.00, was executed on April 13, 1887, and on the next day acknowledged and approved. The condition of the bond, as set forth in the declaration, after reciting that Renshaw had been appointed city treasurer by the city cohncil of said city at its meeting of April 13, 1887, provides, that, \u201cif the said John W. Renshaw shall well and truly perform the duties of said office, and promptly account for and turn over to his successor, or other person designated to receive the same, all monies, \u2022books, papers, property and valuables coming into his hands as such officer, as directed by the city council, then this obligation to be void, otherwise to remain in full force.\u201d The breach assigned is as follows: \u201cAnd for assigning a breach of the condition of said bond,' plaintiff says that on, viz., the.....day of............. A. D. 1888, the said defendant had in his hands, as said treasurer, the sum of, viz., $2000.00, which said sum he had been directed to hold by the circuit court of St. Glair county, in chancery sitting, by an order of said court made in a certain cause therein pending, wherein the said John Dowd was complainant and the said city of East St. Louis and the said John W. Renshaw were defendants, and which said sum the said city, by its city council, ordered and directed the said Renshaw, as treasurer,\u2019 to pay over to the parties entitled thereto, as shown by the said bill, which parties then held certificates of indebtedness or warrants executed by the said city of East St. Louis, of which certificates or warrants the said John Dowd is now, and was at the beginning of this suit, the legal holder; yet the said defendant, Renshaw, did not pay to said John Dowd the said money aforesaid, as directed by the said, city council, although often requested to do so, and still refuses to do so.\u201d</summary><summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"A6f\" pgmap=\"489\">Six pleas were filed to the declaration, which were demurred to. The demurrers were sustained, and, the defendants electing to stand by their pleas, damages were assessed, and judgment rendered for \u00a7100,000.00 debt to be satisfied upon payment of $1967.95 damages, and the costs. Upon appeal to the Appellate Court, this judgment was reversed on February 4,1890, and the cause was remanded to the Circuit Court. Of the six pleas which had been filed to the declaration, four had been demurred to, and the demurrers sustained, and leave was given to amend. The other pleas were two amended pleas which had been filed afterwards on October 4,1888, and which were also demurred to, and the demurrers were sustained. After the cause was remanded, the Circuit Court overruled the demurrers to the amended pleas, and, the plaintiff electing to stand by its demurrers, judgment was rendered in favor of the defendants, and against the plaintiff for costs. This judgment in favor of the defendants, upon a second appeal to the Appellate Court, has been affirmed. The present appeal is prosecuted from such judgment of affirmance.</summary><summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b489-4\" pgmap=\"489(108) 490(105)\">The first of the amended pleas avers, that one Martin Martell was, on April 13, 1888, appointed city treasurer of said city by its city council, and was duly qualified as such, and became the successor in office of said Renshaw as treasurer, and entered upon the duties of the office, and \u201cthat since the last continuance of this cause, to-wit, on the 5th day of June, A. D. 1888, the said Martin Mar-tell, as such treasurer, and as successor of the said John W. Renshaw, by the direction of the city council of said city, to-wit, on the 9th day of July, A. D. 1888, demanded the same sum of $2000.00 mentioned in plaintiff\u2019s declaration of said John W. Renshaw, and the said John W. Renshaw, on the day and year last aforesaid, at the county aforesaid, by the direction of the city council of said city, paid the same $2000.00 in plaintiff\u2019s declaration to hiS successor in office, the said Martin Martell, and this the said defendants are ready to verify, wherefore they pray judgment,\u201d etc. The second amended plea is substantially the same as the first, except that it avers the payment of the $2000.00 mentioned in the declaration to the plaintiff, the City of East St. Louis.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b490-3\" pgmap=\"490\">Messrs.

Bowman, which is authorized by the Bevised Statutes, 1883, chapter 110, section 71.</p> <opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b492-6\" pgmap=\"492\">Mr. Justice Magruder</author> <p id=\"AAh\" pgmap=\"492\">delivered the opinion of the court:</p> <p id=\"b492-7\" pgmap=\"492\">The question in the case is the sufficiency of the amended pleas. We cannot see why the first amended plea, considered by itself, does not present a good defense. Benshaw bound himself by his bond to promptly turn over to his successor all monies coming into his hands as city treasurer, \u201cas directed by the city council.\u201d The plea avers, that his successor was appointed and qualified and had demanded the money, and the city council had directed him to pay it over to such successor, and he had done so. The averment is, that he did just what his bond required him to do.</p> <p id=\"b492-8\" pgmap=\"492\">It is claimed, however, that the plea, being a plea puis darrein continuance, waives all previous pleas, and confesses the matter in dispute between the parties. The general rule is, that a plea puis darrein continuance supersedes all other pleas and defenses in the cause ; and, by operation of law, the previous pleas are stricken from the record, and the cause of action is admitted to the same extent as if no other defense had been urged than that contained in this plea. (Mount v. Scholes, 120 Ill. 394; Waterbury v. McMillan, 46 Miss. 635; Dinet v. Pfirshing, 86 Ill. 83; 1 Chitty on Plead. 690; Simonton v. Tounge, 1 Strobh. 17). \u201cEverything is confessed except the matter contested by the plea puis.\u201d (Kimball v. Huntington, 10 Wend. 677).</p> <p id=\"b493-2\" pgmap=\"493\">What then are the allegations of the declaration which are confessed under the rule stated? The declaration alleges, that the Circuit Court, in a chancery cause therein pending between John Dowd complainant, and the City of East St. Louis and Renshaw, defendants, made an order directing Renshaw to hold the sum of \u00a72000.00, which he had in his hands as city treasurer. It is at the same time alleged, that the said city, by its city council, directed Renshaw, as treasurer, to pay over said sum \u201cto the parties entitled thereto, as shown by the said bill.\u201d The alleged orders appear to be inconsistent with each other. The meaning would seem to be, that the Circuit Court ordered the treasurer to hold the fund, and the city council ordered him to pay it to the complainant in the bill.</p> <p id=\"b493-3\" pgmap=\"493\">But the direction of the city council to pay to John Dowd, and not the direction of the Court to hold the fund, is the direction which is alleged to have been disobeyed. The breach assigned is, not that Renshaw did not hold the fund as directed by the court, but that he did not pay it to John Dowd as directed by the city council. There is no allegation, that he was directed to pay the money to Dowd within any specified time. It may be, that the city auditor was required to audit the claim before the treasurer was bound to pay it, and that it had not been so audited. It may be, that the mayor and city clerk were required to draw and sign a warrant on the city treasurer before the claim could be paid, and that such warrant had not been drawn and signed. If any such preliminary precautions were required by the law or ordinances, and had not been complied with, the treasurer was not at fault if he waited for a compliance with them, before obeying the order of the city council to pay the money to Dowd. At any rate, it does not appear, nor is it alleged, that he was guilty of any unreasonable delay in not paying over the fund after the first order of the council was made.</p> <p id=\"b494-3\" pgmap=\"494\">The filing of the plea of puis darrein continuance may be regarded as confessing that Renshaw was ordered by the city council to pay the money to Dowd, and that he did not do so. Yet it does not confess that there was no good cause for waiting a reasonable time before carrying the order into effect. While thus holding the fund, his term expired, his successor was appointed and entered upon the duties of the office, and, after the last continuance, as the first amended plea avers, such successor made demand for the money, and the city council made a second order directing Renshaw to pay the money to such successor, which order he obeyed. Notwithstanding the admission that the council ordered the payment to Dowd, yet, in the absence of any allegation, that there was any unreasonable delay in obeying that order, the making of a second order by the council to pay the money to the new treasurer before the first order was carred into effect, and the payment of the money to the successor in obedience to the second order, constituted a good defense.</p> <p id=\"b494-4\" pgmap=\"494\">The obligee in the bond is the city of East St. Louis. If it be admitted that the city may bring suit on the bond for the use of another, yet the city is regarded as the real plaintiff, whether the suit is brought for its own use or for the use of others. (Washington v. Young, 10 Wheat. 404). The City of East St. Louis, being the obligee in the bond and the plaintiff in this suit, is estopped from complaining that the obligor obeyed its own order to pay the money to his successor. If it made two contradictory orders, the last will be regarded as overruling or setting aside the first. Otherwise, the existence of contradictory orders might mislead the treasurer. The general rule is well settled, that the penalty of an official bond cannot be invoked where the plaintiff has done anything directly or indirectly to mislead the officer. (Murfree on Official Bonds, secs. 467, 468).</p> <p id=\"b494-5\" pgmap=\"494(23) 495(95)\">It is said that there can be but one plea puis darrein continuance in the same cause. Such seems to be the rule in regard to such pleas. (1 Chitty on Plead. 692; Could on Plead. 347). In the case at bar, however, the court granted leave to file amended pleas, and, when the two amended pleas were filed, plaintiff demurred to both of them. If the filing of the two amended pleas violated the rule stated, the plaintiff should have made a.motion to strike one of them from the files. (Millikin v. Jones, 77 Ill. 372). Under the circumstances, the first plea will be regarded as properly filed, and the second as stricken from the files.</p> <p id=\"b495-5\" pgmap=\"495\">As to the time of filing the plea, the rule in this State is that a plea puis darrein continuance may be filed at any time before trial. (Robinson v. Burkell, 2 Scam. 278).</p> <p id=\"b495-6\" pgmap=\"495\">We think that the first amended plea set up a good defense to the action, and that the demurrer to it was properly overruled.</p> <p id=\"b495-7\" pgmap=\"495\">The judgments of the Appellate and Circuit Courts are affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b495-8\" pgmap=\"495\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
