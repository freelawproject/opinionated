Treat after his death, but denies that the same was placed in the custody of Treat for safe keeping by testatrix, or that he had knowledge of its existence; denies that Samuel H. Treat took possession of any property belonging to Sarah M. Bennett at or since her death, and that in truth she was not the owner of any property, real or personal, in her own right, at the time of her death; that long prior to the death of Sarah M.

Bennett filed a cross-bill, making all other parties to the original bill defendants ; alleging the death of Sarah M. Bennett, and that she left a will, as set out in the original bill; that the will was left in the custody of Samuel H. Treat, who failed to present the same for probate, and the same was not probated until after his death; that Treat took possession of all the property of Sarah M. Bennett, deceased, and retained the same in his possession without probating the will or obtaining any authority to hold the same, and did use, retain and possess all of said property, and the proceeds thereof, as his own property, until the date of his death ; that the said Samuel H. Treat did receive and so appropriate of the property of the said Sarah M. Bennett at the time of her death, the following : Money on hand, \u00a7914.61, notes and mortgages, $19,386.54, notes, $3000, making a total of $23,301.15; that all of said notes bore ten per cent interest, and that said Treat placed said $914.61 at interest at the same rate, and received the income thereof from the death of Sarah M. Bennett until his death; that the interest on said sums would amount to $2330.11 per annum, all of which, according to the terms of the will, should have been paid to complainant by said Treat, as well as the sum of $13,301.15, being the amount placed in his hands, under the terms of the will, in excess of the sum of $10,000 to be by him held in trust for the children of the complainant; that about the month of May, 1874, the said Samuel H. Treat rendered complainant an account, which showed there was in his hands belonging to said estate, in secured notes, a principal sum of $17,463.56, and cash on hand, $2335.11, making a total of $19,798.67, besides the interest then due and payable on the same; that said statement included all amounts paid by Samuel H. Treat to complainant and every other person to whom the estate of Sarah M. Bennett was indebted, and also stated the balance in his hands belonging to said estate on the first day of May, 1874, less the interest due and unpaid upon the notes and securities he held, which unpaid interest complainant believes was in the neighborhood of $5000; that complainant has received many sums of money taken from the income of the said fund since the first day of May, 1874, the total amount of which he has no means of accurately ascertaining, but that an account of such payments was kept by the said Samuel H. Treat and is now in the possession of said administrator of his estate, but he distinctly denies that he has ever received any portion of the principal of the estate of the said Sarah M. Bennett, and, as he believes, but a portion of the income thereof due him; that Samuel H. Treat took and held the moneys and securities belonging to the estate of Sarah M. Bennett without having probated her will or given bond and security, and he thereby became executor de son tort of said estate, and as such the administrator of his estate should be required to make an account, etc.; that he haS never had any settlement or accounting, etc. The prayer of the cross-bill is, that the administrator of the estate of Samuel H.

Treat was a trustee, as such holding and managing a fund of $10,000 for the use of Charles W. Bennett during his lifetime, and to go to his children at his death ; that said sum of $10,000 was so held and managed by said Treat under the will of Sarah M. Bennett; that in and by said will the said Treat was named and designated as the sole executor thereof ; that said Sarah M. Bennett died on or about the 30th day of October, 1869, testate; that said Treat, from the time of the death of said Sarah M. Bennett till the time of his death, as aforesaid, held in his custody the said will of Sarah M. Bennett, and also took and held her estate, and that after the death of said Treat the said will of Sarah M.

Bennett and Chesley M.

If this question can be answered affirmatively, the complainants in the bill had no standing in court.</summary><summary data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-4\" pgmap=\"276\">\u201cWe are persuaded the rule has been abolished by statutory provisions in force since January 13,1821. Sec; tions 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the act then passed, entitled \u2018An act concerning partitions and joint rights and obligations,\u2019 are as follows:</summary><summary data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-5\" pgmap=\"276\">\u201c \u2018Sec. 1. That all joint tenants, or tenants in common, who now are or hereafter shall be possessed of any estate of inheritance, or estates less than those of inheritance, either in their own rights or in the rights of their wives, may be compelled to make partition between them of such lands, tenements or hereditaments as they now hold, or hereafter shall hold, as joint tenants or tenants in common: Provided, however, that no such partition between joint tenants or tenants in common who hold or shall hold estates for life or years, with others holding equal or greater estate, shall prejudice any entitled to the reversion or remainder after the death of the tenants for life or after the expiration of the years.</summary><summary data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-6\" pgmap=\"276\">\u201c \u2018Sec. 2. That if partition be not made between joint tenants, the parts of those who die first shall not accrue to the survivor or survivors, but descend or pass by devise, and shall be subject to debts, dower, charges, etc., or transmissible to executors or administrators, and be considered, to every intent and purpose, in the same view as if such deceased joint tenants had been tenants in common.</summary><summary data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-7\" pgmap=\"276\">\u201c\u2018Sec. 3. That for assuming and exercising exclusive ownership over, or taking away, destroying, lessening in value; or otherwise injuring or abusing, the thing held in joint tenancy, tenancy in common or parcenary, the party aggrieved shall have his action of trespass or trover' for the injury, in the same way as if such joint tenancy, etc., did not exist.</summary><summary data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b276-8\" pgmap=\"276\">\u201c \u2018Sec. 4. That all joint obligations and covenants shall hereafter be taken and held to be joint and several obligations and covenants, \u2019</summary><summary data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b277-4\" pgmap=\"277\">\u201cIn the revision of 1833 (p. 473) the same provisions are found under the same title, but in the revision of 1845, section 1 was transferred, in substance, to chapter 79, entitled \u2018Partitions, \u2019 while sections 2, 3 and 4 became sections 1, 2 and 3 of chapter 56, entitled \u2018Joint rights and obligations,\u2019 and so the provisions may be found in the revision of 1874, chapters 76 and 106. In the revision of 1845 a slight change was made in section 3, the words \u2018any property\u2019 having been substituted for the words \u2018the thing.\u2019</summary><summary data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b277-5\" pgmap=\"277\">\u201cIt seems reasonably clear that section 2 of the act of 1821, being section 1 of the present chapter 76, is broad enough to include personal as well as real property, and that some of the phraseology, to-wit, that referring to transmissibility to executors and administrators, is especially applicable to personal estate. Section 3 of the original act (section 2 of chapter 76) manifestly includes a reference to personal property held in joint ownership, and has been so construed by our Supreme Court. (Benjamin v. Stremple, 13 Ill. 466; Boyle v. Levings, 28 id. 314; German National Bank v. Meadoworoft, 95 id. 124.) Regarding these sections together, as we necessarily must, strengthens the position of the appellee. After a full consideration of all arguments adduced by counsel, we \u2022are satisfied with the conclusion reached by the circuit court on this branch of the case.</summary><summary data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b277-6\" pgmap=\"277(114) 278(11)\">\u201cReturning now to the points made by appellant in the order as they appear in the brief: It is urged, first, that the relief is not within the jurisdiction of a court of equity. This objection does not appear to have been pressed in the court below, and the position now taken, that an adequate remedy at law is afforded by the statute in reference to administrations, should not be presented for the first time in this court. (Chicago Theological Seminary v. Gage, 103 Ill. 175.) But we think the subject matter and the conditions are such that the county court could not adequately deal with the rights of the parties, and that a resort to chancery was proper, and, indeed, necessary.</summary><summary data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b278-3\" pgmap=\"278\">\u201cThe next point, that necessary parties were omitted, must also be overruled. There was no attempt to administer the estate generally, but merely to withdraw from the hands of the administrator a certain fund, as not belonging to the estate, and to place it in the hands of a trustee, to be managed according to certain directions contained in the will of Mrs. Bennett.</summary><summary data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b278-4\" pgmap=\"278\">\u201cIn this connection may be noticed the point fifthly made, that the decree is erroneous in charging the estate of Samuel H. Treat with any act or default of his, as executor or trustee under said will. It is true, the executor named in the will did not present the same for probate, and did not formally act as executor, but he assumed to manage, handle and control the property affected by the will, and there was evidence tending to show that he recognized it as the property of the testatrix, and as subject to the testamentary provisions. We are unable to see any force in this objection.</summary><summary data-order=\"41\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b278-5\" pgmap=\"278(173) 279(58)\">\u201cA further point is made that there has been no such identification of the trust fund, or of its proceeds, as will enable the court to lay hold of any property in the hands of the administrator as impressed with the trust. A majority of the court are of the opinion' this point is not well taken, and that the decree in this respect is sufficiently supported by the proof. The statute provides that where a decedent has received money in trust for any purpose, his administrator shall pay the same out as a sixth-class claim. (Rev. Stat. chap. 3, sec. 70.) The claim thus arising takes precedence of other debts and demands of a general nature, which constitute claims of the seventh class. On examining the report of the administrator, which appears in the abstract, it is quite evident that there were ample funds for the payment of all claims of the first, second, third, fourth and fifth classes. It follows, that even though the identification of the funds, or the proceeds thereof, may not be what the law would require, yet by virtue of this provision of the statute the money in question must be paid out in preference to the claims of ordinary creditors, and that no error was committed in this respect, since the rule of the statute has been substantially carried out.</summary><summary data-order=\"42\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b279-5\" pgmap=\"279\">\u201cFinally, it is objected the decree is erroneous in providing that the money should be managed by the trustee as provided in the will, because it thereby gives Charles W. Bennett the income of the money during his lifetime, when, by the former decree in the case, it was found that though he was entitled to all the money remaining in the hands of said Treat, the balance so due him was but $3500, for which a decree was rendered, and that the money had been paid him. It is suggested, therefore, that in making the further provision for him, as was done in this decree, the court erred, and it is argued that the income of the $10,000 should be used to reimburse the estate of Judge Treat the amount thus paid to said Bennett in excess of what should have been paid to him. It appears that the former decree was in fact rendered by consent, though the decree upon its face does not so show, and that C. W. Bennett did not appeal from it.</summary><summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b279-6\" pgmap=\"279(145) 280(65)\">\u201cWe are inclined to hold that the entire decree was reversed, although C. W. Bennett did not appeal. Hence it would seem that the matters arising upon the cross-bill should have been examined. It will be noticed that the allegations of the cross-bill, as well as of Bennett\u2019s answer, are consistent with the theory of the original bill. The cross-bill merely seeks an accounting as to the balance due C. W. Bennett as owner of one-half of the money originally placed in the hands of Judge Treat, and as residuary legatee of his mother. The first decree, however, found that he took the whole as survivor, and that there was due him on that account $3500. This amount was at once paid him, and when the decree was reversed it may be conceded that he should account for it to the administrator. Now, the question is, in what way may the administrator have relief? Probably he could recover the amount in an action at law, but he might also have relief in this proceeding, the parties all being before the court. In order to have such relief, it would be necessary that the court should be properly called upon at the instance of the administrator.</summary><summary data-order=\"44\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b280-5\" pgmap=\"280\">\u201cIt seems that the issue made up on the cross-bill of C. W. Bennett was not presented to the court on the last hearing, and there appears to have been no examination of the question as to the amount due him from the estate. This branch of the case was, in effect, ignored or passed over. The record shows that the cause was submitted upon the issues made on the original bill, and the answers and the replications thereto.' It is-not indispensable that the issue arising on the cross-bill should be heard along with that arising on the original bill. Myers v. Manny, 63 Ill. 211.</summary><summary data-order=\"45\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b280-6\" pgmap=\"280(199) 281(157)\">\u201cThe amended answer of Bradford sets np the former decree ; that he paid said sum of $3500. to C. W. Bennett; that said Bennett did not appeal therefrom, and that the same is in full force and nnreversed as to him. It would appear, therefore, that the administrator was disposed to regard the former decree as a finality, so far as G. W. Bennett was concerned, and that no effort was made to interpose it as a bar to the relief sought by the complainants. Assuming that that decree was reversed, and that the money paid thereunder should be accounted for by G. W. Bennett, and that he should be required to refund it, or that his income on the $10,000 should be used to reimburse the estate for the excess received by him, the question is, whether, upon the pleadings and evidence, the pr\u00e9sent decree is erroneous because containing no such provision. In the first place, it is not apparent what, if any, excess Bennett really has received, assuming that he took nothing as survivor; and in the second place, we are inclined to think that, under the pleadings as made up, the administrator should not now be heard to make the point. By his amended answer he affirmed the binding force of the former decree as to O. W. Bennett. That decree, according to the pleadings as then made up, could not affect the rights of the complainants, though upon its face and according to its findings it did deny any interest to them in the estate. Nor did the administrator ask the court for any relief as against C. W. Bennett in respect to that money. Such relief might have been sought by cross-bill, but none was filed, nor did the answer set up any desire for such relief. Indeed, the whole issue submitted to the court was upon the main question, presented by the original bill and the answers, as to the rights of complainants. In view of the situation thus presented, we hold that the decree should not be reversed for this cause.</summary><summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b281-5\" pgmap=\"281\">\u201cNo other objections are urged, and failing to discover any error of substance in the decree, we must affirm it.\u201d</summary><attorneys data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b281-6\" pgmap=\"281\">Messrs.

Bennett v. Bradford, 132 Ill. 269.</p> <opinion data-order=\"61\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\"> <author id=\"b283-6\" pgmap=\"283\">Mr. Justice Baker</author> <p id=\"AQG\" pgmap=\"283\">delivered the opinion of the court:</p> <p id=\"b283-7\" pgmap=\"283\">Appellant urges that his position was misunderstood by the Appellate Court, and he re-states his claim. His contention, in substance, is this: that the decree ordering the administrator of Judge Treat\u2019s estate to pay $3500 to Charles W. Bennett was rendered in a suit to which all persons in interest were parties; that said amount was decreed to be the residue of the estate theretofore jointly owned by Sarah M. and Charles W. Bennett ; that the administrator paid said sum to Charles W. Bennett before the decree was reversed and before the writ of error was' issued, and that therefore such payment must be regarded as a credit upon any sum found due the complainants in the original bill, notwithstanding the fact that the decree was subsequently reversed and the theory of the original bill sustained.</p> <p id=\"b283-8\" pgmap=\"283(154) 284(136)\">Special attention is called by appellant to what this court said in Goudy v. Hall, 36 Ill. 313. The language there used and here quoted by appellant is this: \u201cSociety should be able to rely upon the judgments and decrees of its courts, and although it knows that they are liable to be reversed, yet it has a right, so long as they stand, to presume they have been properly rendered.\u201d This language was used by the court in pointing out the difference, in case of a judicial sale, in the position occupied by third persons from that occupied by parties to the proceeding in which the sale was decreed. The word \u201csociety,\u201d found in the quotation, is used as synonymous with third persons, or strangers to the decree. The ground of the decision in Goudy v. Hall was, that since the circuit court had jurisdiction of the persons in interest and subject matter, it was of no moment how erroneous the proceedings of the court may have been, the rights of third persons, acquired while such proceedings were unreversed, and by virtue of them, must be protected. (See the subsequent case of Wadhams et al. v. Gay, 73 Ill. 415, and the numerous authorities there cited.) It was there, in substance, said, that when a judgment or decree has been reversed, then, as between the parties to the litigation, they are all to be restored to their original rights, but that the rights of third persons are not affected ; and also that this principle is not confined to the case of judicial sales, but that it applies to judgments and decrees which simply declare and vest the legal right in the party claiming it.</p> <p id=\"b284-5\" pgmap=\"284\">The foundation stone of the distinction between the case of parties to the suit and the case of third parties is the element of notice. The law presumes that a party to the suit or proceeding has notice of every fact and step in the proceedings of the court, from their commencement until after their completion, and he is bound to know that all the proceedings are legal. Herman on Executions, p. 488, sec. 328.</p> <p id=\"b284-6\" pgmap=\"284(163) 285(59)\">It is claimed that the $3500 paid to Charles W. Bennett should be deducted from the trust fund decreed to be paid to appellees, and that if said sum of $3500 belongs to appellees, they should be required to look to the person to whom the trustee paid' it. And in that connection great reliance is \u2022 placed in the case of Kettleby v. Lamb, 2 Ch. Rep. 404, which was quoted and approved of by Lord Bedesdale in Bennett v. Hammill, 2 Scho. &amp; Lef. 566. The case was that of a bill praying that a certain sum of money in the hands of trustees might be laid out for the benefit of the plaintiff. The bill was dismissed, and the decree of dismission signed and enrolled, after which the trustee paid the money to the other party, who had claimed it. On a bill of review that decree was reversed, yet the court determined that the trustees, in regard that they relied upon the dismission, signed and enrolled, were indemnified thereby, and that the plaintiff should be put to seek the money against the persons to whom the trustees had paid it, on the ground that the judgment, while it remained in force, bound the rights and justified the parties, though they paid it voluntarily and without suit.</p> <p id=\"b285-5\" pgmap=\"285\">There is a marked and controlling distinction between Kettleby v. Lamb and the case at bar. There the decree that was reversed was the result of a hearing before the chancellor, and was the act and voice of the chancellor, and embodied his judgment and adjudication upon the rights of the parties. Here the decree that was reversed was a decree that was entered by consent and agreement of parties, and without either a hearing before or adjudication by the court. (Bennett v. Bradford, 132 Ill. 269.) These infant appellees were incapable of consenting to the decree that deprived them of their property, and it would be highly inequitable and unjust to hold that their trustee and their father, both claiming interests that were hostile to theirs, could agree between themselves upon a decree and have it entered, whereby the trustee was relieved of all liability for $6500 of the trust fund, and the father was decreed the residue, $3500, which he was not entitled to have; and then, the subsequent act, based on the decree so entered, of the trustee paying the $3500 to the father, has the effect of relieving the trustee of liability to account to his infant cestuis que trust for the sum so paid.</p> <p id=\"b285-6\" pgmap=\"285\">The conclusions we have arrived at in respect to the general merits of this case are fully and well expressed in the opinion of the Appellate Court. We approve the views therein expressed, and adopt them as our own.</p> <p id=\"b285-7\" pgmap=\"285\">The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.</p> <p id=\"b285-8\" pgmap=\"285\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
