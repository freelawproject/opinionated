P.

In payment therefor he gave $6700 in cash, and his two notes, payable to the order of appellee, for $6650 each. The notes bore six per cent interest from date, and were payable at Standiford Bros. \u2019 bank, Chrisman, Illinois, one on or before March 1, 1892, and the other on or before March 1,1893. On September 8, 1891, while appellee was temporarily absent in Kentucky, appellant went to the bank of Standiford Bros., where the notes were payable and where they had been left by appellee, and expressed his desire to pay them. Accordingly he thereupon delivered to the bank his check for $259.25, being the amount of the interest then due on the first of the above notes, and also his two notes payable to the order of Standiford Bros.. the one for $5000 and the other for $1650, being the amount of the principal of said first note, requesting the bank to credit appellee\u2019s account with the total of those three sums, whereupon the bank surrendered to appellant appellee\u2019s first note, stamped paid, etc. On September 14,1891, appellant delivered to the bank his check for $264.50, and also his note dated September 12, 1891, payable to the order of Standiford Bros., for $6650, representing, respectively, the amount of the interest then due on his second note to appellee and the amount of the principal thereof. The bank was instructed, as before, to credit appellee\u2019s account with the amounts represented by the check and the new note. The bank then surrendered to appellant appellee\u2019s second note, stamped paid, etc. The notes of September 8 and 12, payable to the order of Standiford Bros., bore five per cent interest from date. Shortly thereafter, on September 26, the Standiford Bros, absconded, taking with them the funds then in the possession of the bank. Appellee, about this time, returned home from his visit to Kentucky, when he first learned that the two notes executed to him by appellant had been surrendered to the latter by the bank. He then demanded of appellant that he return the notes to him, and upon his refusing so to do brought replevin against appellant, but, the officer failing to obtain possession of the notes, a count in trover was filed.. The cause was tried before a jury, in the Edgar circuit court, and judgment was rendered in favor of appellee and against appellant for $13,828 and costs, after $40 of the damages assessed by the jury had been remitted by appellee. From that judgment appellant appealed to the Appellate Court, where the judgment of the circuit court was reversed and the cause remanded, with directions that upon a remittitur being made by the plaintiff below of $523.75, judgment be entered in his favor on the verdict for the residue, viz., $13,299.25 and costs, and that in case of a failure to make such remittitur within thirty days after the reinstatement of the cause in the court below, the defendant should be awarded a new trial. Appellant now asks that the judgments of the Appellate and circuit courts be reversed.</summary><attorneys data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b166-5\" pgmap=\"166\">Mr. Anthony Thornton, Mr. Robert L.

The bank, then, having been authorized by appellee to collect the notes, the question arises, did it transcend its authority in the manner of accepting payment,\u2014in other words, were the notes in fact paid.</p> <p id=\"b168-7\" pgmap=\"168\">It is the well settled rule in regard 'to negotiable paper, that payment can only be made with money, except with the consent of the holder, and that an agent to collect cannot accept anything but money in payment, unless he has been expressly authorized by his principal to receive something else. Lochenmeyer v. Fogarty, 112 Ill. 572; Padfleld v. Green, 85 id. 529; Nolan v. Jackson, 16 id. 272; Tiedeman on Com. Paper, sec. 375, and authorities there cited; 18 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, 194, and authorities cited in note 1. There is here no claim that appellee consented that the notes should be paid otherwise than in money, or that he authorized the bank to accept in his behalf anything but money in payment of them. Did the bank receive from appellant money in discharge of the notes? If so, they were properly paid. It is not claimed that any money actually changed hands, but appellant\u2019s contention is, that he borrowed from the bank the mon\u00a7y to pay the notes, and had the amounts due on them credited by the bank upon appellee\u2019s account out of the funds so borrowed.</p> <p id=\"b168-8\" pgmap=\"168(50) 169(348)\">The record discloses these facts: That on September 8, 1891, appellant delivered to the bank his check for $259.25, which was the amount of the interest due and unpaid on the first of the notes here in controversy, and also delivered to it his two notes, for $1650 and $5000, respectively, these two notes together making the amount of the principal of the aforesaid note. The new notes drew five per cent interest from their date, and were made payable to the order of Standiford Bros. The bank thereupon surrendered to appellant, stamped paid, the first of the aforesaid notes which had been placed in its hands for collection by appellee. On September 14, 1891, appellant delivered to the bank, his check for $264.50, which was the amount of the interest due and unpaid on the second of the last mentioned notes, and also delivered to it his note dated September 12, 1891, for $6650, which was the amount of the principal of that note. The new note drew five per cent interest from its date, and was made payable to the order of Standiford Bros. The bank thereupon surrendered to appellant, stamped paid, the second of the notes belonging to appellee. The books of the bank, which were offered in evidence, showed the receipt, on September 8,1891, of appellant\u2019s notes for $5000 and $1650, respectively, but no credit to him as for money, and showed the charge to him of the check for $259.25. Appellee\u2019s account, in the ledger, showed a credit to him of that date of $6909.25. The books showed also the receipt, on September 14, 1891, of appellant\u2019s note of the 12th for $6650, but no credit to him for money, and also showed the charge to him of the check for $264.50. In appellee\u2019s account, on the ledger, there appeared a credit to him on the 14th of $6914.50. The journal, which contained the original entry of this item of credit, showed it as follows: \u201cSeptember 14, Monday.\u2014W. T. Gilkey, by Josephus Scott, note and interest, $6914.50.\u201d The journal statement of the credit of September 8 was as follows: \u201cSeptember 8, Tuesday, \u201991.\u2014W. T. Gilkey, $6909.25.\u201d The books thus showed that appellant was not credited therein with the money he claims to have borrowed of the bank, and with which he claims to have taken up the notes in controversy.</p> <p id=\"b170-4\" pgmap=\"170\">The contention of appellant that the alleged payment of the said notes was made with money borrowed of the bank is in direct conflict with the entries in the bank books, and is not even supported by his own testimony, when it is considered as a whole. Appellant attempted to make payment of the notes payable to appellee by giving to Standiford Bros., the bankers, his notes payable to them. It follows, therefore, that the principal of the notes which are the subject of this suit has not been paid. See authorities cited supra.</p> <p id=\"b170-5\" pgmap=\"170\">With reference, however, to the interest on those notes, we take a different view, and are of the opinion that appellant\u2019s checks for $259.25 and $264.50, respectively, dated September 8, 1891, and September 12, 1891, constituted a valid payment of the interest due at those dates. According to appellant\u2019s testimony he had on deposit in the bank, at the time he delivered the checks to it, sufficient money to pay them, and there is nothing in the record to show that this was not the fact. The amounts of the checks were charged against him and credited to appellee on the books of the bank.</p> <p id=\"b170-6\" pgmap=\"170\">Appellant further contends that the. trial court erred in giving the fourth instruction for appellee, and in refusing to give the second, seventh, twelfth and thirteenth instructions asked in his own behalf, and urges that therefore the judgments of the courts below ought to be reversed. The trial court undoubtedly erred, as thus contended, but, in the light of what we have already said, we do not think the errors in question could have materially prejudiced the rights of appellant, of that we would be justified in reversing the judgments of the trial and Appellate Courts on account of those errors.</p> <p id=\"b170-7\" pgmap=\"170\">We are of opinion that the judgment of the circuit court, as modified by the judgment of the Appellate Court, was right, and since we find no harmful error in the record, the judgment of the Appellate Court is therefore affirmed.</p> <p id=\"ACQ\" pgmap=\"170\">Judgment affirmed.</p> </opinion> </casebody> ",
