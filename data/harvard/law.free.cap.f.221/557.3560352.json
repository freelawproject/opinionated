The land was situated in another county, and the law then required such sales to he made at the <em>door </em>of the courthouse in the <em>county </em>where the land was situated, unless otherwise ordered by the probate court. The records did not show such an order. The validity of the sale was not questioned for more than 60 years, when an heir of the decedent brought an action to recover the land. In the meantime the taxes had been paid by the purchaser and his successors in title, some of whom were in actual possession. <em>Held, </em>that under the law of Texas, as long settled by decision, in favor of an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>ancient deed, the fact that the sale was reported, that the presiding judge of the probate court took the acknowledgment of the deed on the same day, and later approved the administrator\u2019s accounts, would be taken as an approval of the sale, and a substantial compliance with the statute, and validated the deed.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b571-11\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>^=s\u00bbFor other cases see same topic <em>&amp; </em>KEY-NUMBER in all Key-Numbered Digests &amp; Indexes</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b572-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>[Ed.

Some of the defendants, claiming parts of the tract by adverse possession, offered in evidence a deed purporting to have been executed by the original grantee in 1860, under which, through mesne conveyances,- they had been in possession for nearly 50 years. There was no evidence of the identity of the grantor, except the recital in the deed itself. <em>Held, </em>that such deed could not be declared a forgery as matter of law, but that it should have been admitted in evidence and the issue submitted to the jury.</syllabus>\n<syllabus data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b572-7\">[Ed.

Osborn brought this suit under statutory allegations in trespass to try title for the recovery from W. H. Stark and others of 1,107 acres of land in Orange county, Tex., comprising the John M. Henrie headright. All the land in said grant, except 397 acres off the north side thereof, was recovered by the defendant below under the statutes of limitation; and it is agreed that the judgment is proper in so far as said award is made in favor of said defendant, and the only issues involved upon this writ are confined to the recovery by the plaintiff, upon peremptory instructions from the court, of the remaining 397 acres.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b572-11\">The plaintiff, to support the issue upon her part, offered a certified copy of the original grant to John M. Henrie, dated March 30, 1835, reciting that Henrie was a farmer and stockraiser, and granting him the land in controversy. She also testified in person as follows: \u201cMy name is Rosa P. Osborn. I am a widow. My father\u2019s name was William C. Duffield, and my mother\u2019s name was Priscilla Duffield. My mother had been married, before she married my father, to a man by the name of John M. Henrie, and she had one child by her first marriage, which survived, its father, John M. Henrie. My mother and John M. Henrie were married at Nashville, Tenn., and said -John M, Henrie died about the year 1839. My mother married William C. Duffield about 1841, and I was bom about 1846. My information that John M. Henrie died about 1839 was obtained from my mother, from family history \u2014just family history is all I know about it. After my mother\u2019s marriage to John M. Henrie, they came to Texas, and from there they went to New Orleans, and lived there a short time. I am telling you this as my mother told me. My grandfather, Geo. Antonio Nixon, had him give up his business and come to San Augustine, Tex. My grandfather, Geo. Antonio Nixon, who was my mother\u2019s father, was the same party whose name runs through the records here in Texas. I was reared in Mississippi. My present home is in Biloxi. I have lived there 18 years, and have lived at other places\u2014among them are Brandon, Vicksburg, Clinton, and Bay City. I knew the father, mother, grandfather, and grandmother of my attorney, Mr. Clark. The John-M. Henrie <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>which I mentioned was my mother\u2019s first husband, and he died leaving one child by the name of George A. Henrie, which ehild was named after its grandfather. Said ehild died at San Augustine, Tex., and that was the only child said John M. Henrie left. This child died, and my mother married my father, Mr. Duffield. My father and mother had three children, myself and a brother and sister, both older than me. They are dead. My mother is dead. She died in Louisiana in 1861, during the war. We refugeed there during the war. I am the plaintiff in this case.\u201d</summary>\n<syllabus data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"syllabus\" id=\"b572-12\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>other cases see same topic <em>&amp; </em>KEY-NUMBER in all Key-Numbered Digests <em>&amp; </em>Indexes</syllabus>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b573-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>Tlie defendants deraigned title under deed of J. M. Henrie, a resident of Sabine parish, La., dated I860, reciting himself to be the person to wnom the land in controversy was granted by the Mexican government, and conveying to Josiah Bell the said land, which deed was duly recorded in volume I), pages 127 to 129, of the deed records of Orange county. They also introduced a deed from Josiah Bell, dated January 12, 1861, conveying the property in question to S. Melton, which deed is recorded in Volume D, pages 135 and 136, of the deed records of Orange county, Tex., June 27, 1862; and it is admitted that each and all the defendants hold title under said Josiah Bell and the said S. Melton by regular chains of title to themselves. It was shown that S. Melton, through whom said defendants deraigned title, was district clerk of Orange county, and afterwards a school-teacher, and was a man of good reputation. There was nothing in the evidence to show any personal claim to the land by J. M. Henrie, of Sabine parish, La., except by his sale of it, and the recita! of his deed that it was deeded to him by the Mexican government. Since the date of this sale, however, it is undisputed that parts of the land have been held under continuous possession, assertion of ownership, and payment of taxes under Ms title, unchallenged, for at least 50 years.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b573-5\">On the other hand, there is nothing to connect the John M. Henrie, under whom the plaintiff claimed, with the land in controversy, except an inventory of lands as part of Ms estate, and a sale of said land by an administrator, all in San Augustine county, republic of Texas. It is 'shown, however, that there has been no open claim under him for almost 50 years. After the San Augustine John M. Henrie died, this land was sold by his administrator, A. W. Canfield, to R. B. Russell on April 7, 1846, and on May 2, 1816, Russell conveyed 1he land to Canfield for a recited consideration of $1,000, and on June 5, 1816, Canfield conveyed to Daniel McLeod for $2,750. This suit was filed October 15, 1913, and prior to its institution McLeod\u2019s heirs brov ght suit against the defendants to recover the land, and on January 27, 1913, the heirs executed by way of compromise, a deed <em>to </em>the defendants by which the latter acquired such title as passed by the deed of Canfield, administrator, to Russell. This said i&gt;robnte sale was conceded to be legally sufficient in all tilings, except that it was contended that same was invalid, because the sale was found by the court to have been made at the courthouse door of San x\\.ugustiue county, where the proceedings were pending, rather tiian at the courthouse door of the county in which the land was situated.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b573-6\">In addition to these two titles, it was proved by uncontroverted evidence that B. D. Harris held the 197-acre tract in continuous inclosure, occupancy, use, and enjoyment, under duly registered deed, and accompanied with the yearly payment of taxes, for more than 5 years p\u00bbrior to tlie institution of this suit, and after plaintiff\u2019s disabilities were removed. So it seems that the defendant had two record titles to all of the land in controversy, and claimed a limitation title to 197 acres of it. If the Louisiana J. M. Henrie, under whom tlie sole possession had been held and assertion of ownership made, was the grantee of the land, as claimed by him, then the plaintiff is not connected in any way with the title, and ought not to recover. If the probate sale of interest (if any) of the estate of the San Augustine county John M. Henrie was valid, then there was nothing for the plaintiff to recover under the said John M. Henrie, and if B. D. Harris was given the benefit of Ms possession and limitation under the five-year statutes, plaintiff should not have recovered that tract.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b573-7\">The judgment of the court is based upon a peremptory instruction to the jury, directing them to bring in a verdict for the plaintiff for all of the 397 acres held in question, and said peremptory instruction seems to be based on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>the following reasons: (a) That the deed from J. M. Henrie, executed in Louisiana in 1860, was void as a matter of law, because there was no proof as to what John M. Henrie executed the same, (b) That the San Augustine county J. M. Henrie was the one to whom the land was titled as a matter of law, and the issue, of identity was not for the jury, (c) That the probate sale of San Augustine county J. M. Henrie. was void, because the sale should have been made at the courthouse door of Jefferson county (in which county the land was situated), rather than at the courthouse door of San Augustine county, where the administration was pending, (d) That B. D. Harris could not mature title under the five-year statute of limitations, because he claimed under the deed from the Louisiana J. M. Henrie, which the court found a8 a matter of law to have been a forged instrument.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b574-5\">Upon the question of the validity of the probate sale in San Augustine county, the defendant offered the probate records and filed papers affecting the said sale as follows:</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b574-6\">Petition for letters of administration, filed in office July 26, 1839.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b574-7\">An order dated August 27, 1839, appointing Priscilla A.

And the trial court having considered said objection, sustained the same, and excluded the said deed from evidence, upon said objection, to which action of the court the defendants then and there excepted.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"65\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b576-10\">The defendants then offered in evidence an order of the probate court of San Augustine county, entered January 27, 1847, and recorded in Volume B, page 96, of the Probate Minutes of San Augustine county as follows: \u201cEstate of John M.

I left there and came here when I was 29 years old, and I don\u2019t believe I have been away more than four months since that time. I moved back six or seven years ago. I have been a land dealer and had a license to practice law. I have been engaged in dealing in land and inspecting the records of San Augustine county. I have had occasion to examine the probate records of that county. I know the condition of the probate record in reference to the file of papers, records, etc., especially \u25a0 since 1898 to 1899. In 1899, I think it was, the courthouse and records were burned. The courthouse was burned, and there was a great big fire in town, and the records were scattered about there considerably, and I don\u2019t think they have all been found; a kind of general mixture of file papers. I have examined the papers of many estates in-that county. I do\u2019 not think that the papers generally are intact; that is my general impression, and I judge that from rather intimate knowledge of the records there. In- the first place, as I remember it, and I think it is true, for a great many years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>tlic.ro was a little wooden desk in the clerk\u2019s office unlocked, and as a general thing the probate papers were loose in this little desk. It was unlocked, and there was no apparent supervision over it. Any one could go there and examine them that wanted to. When we had the fire in 1889 and were building a new courthouse, and the records removed to a box house, and they were scattered, and I don\u2019t think they have ever been as carefully put away as before the burning of the building. I saw a lot of old papers I had seen about the courthouse before the fire, with fire marks on them, lying about the) streets. I want to say that I never saw any probate papers lying on the street, but papers that looked familiar to me. Subsequent to that time I could not particularize any estate, but I can s\u00a7y generally the papers are very; loosely kept.\u201d Cross-examination: \u201cI have no personal knowledge of any of the papers of the estate of J. M. Henrie having been lost. The minute books were not kept in this wooden desk. The minute books of the probate court are intact, hut they are very badly worn. They are old. I think there are some obliterations, but as a general thing you can read them. The minute books have never been destroyed.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"67\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b577-4\">S. W. Blount testified as follows: \u201cI would say that I am familiar with the records of San Augustine county. I have known them for 40 years. With reference to the file of papers at the present time in estates generally there, the old estates settled in the 30\u2019s and 40\u2019s, as a rule I found the papers in very good shape\u2014as a rule. In some of the very oldest estates some of the papers are missing. I can call to mind a matter recently. The Quirk estate, which is perhaps the first estate opened in that county, some of the papers are not there. In the very oldest estates some of the papers are missing, papers in estates between \u201932 and \u201933 and \u201940. I have found in looking some of the very old papers over ijertinent to very old administrations, I sometimes did not find the papers I thought ought to be there. As far as my experience goes the minutes of the court in reference to administration of the \u201940\u2019s are in very good shape. I don\u2019t mean they are as carefully kept as some records, but the papers are most all there. As a rule I found all the papers I thought ought to be in an estate. They are all separate packages. My recollection is that Mr. Crockett was clerk 24 or 25 years ago. He went through the old papers; most of them were loose and not in packages, and he went through them and sorted them out. Prior to that time they had been kept in wooden pigeon holes on the wall marked \u2018A,\u2019 \u2018B,\u2019 \u2018C,\u2019 etc., and all the names of estates beginning with \u2018A\u2019 in the \u2018A\u2019 box, those beginning with \u2018B\u2019 in the \u2018B\u2019 box, etc. 1 don\u2019t recollect that I ever saw one of the reports of administrators out of place, but I would not say they were not. I would not say that I did not find all of the orders entered on the minutes as should have been, because the minutes were very well kept and all the hooks are there I think. The first probate book there is in my father\u2019s handwriting, and he was the first clerk of the county; Book A of the Probate Minutes. It is still intact, but badly worn. I never did investigate the papers or minutes generally. I had papers involving a certain administration ; I investigated those papers. I have never investigated, and don\u2019t know, generally, the condition of the records. Only such idea as I got from investigating a particular estate; the Quirk estate was one of them. That was the last estate I investigated, and I found those papers were not all there. I investigated the Waterhouse estate, which was of date of about 1876. and the papers seemed to be intact. I have not recently made any investigation of any old estate except the Quirk estate.\u201d Cross-examination: \"I have been an active practitioner of law at San Augustine bar for a number of years; about 38 years. The minutes of the probate court in which the orders of the court are kept have never been destroyed. They are intact as far as having been destroyed and burned is concerned. I am not as familiar with the records of other counties as of San Augustine county, and I could hardly say as to whether they compare favorably with other counties in which I have practiced law as to regularity. I met the plaintiff, Mrs. Osborn, last night. I know her family by reputation and condition. They left there before I was born. I heard my father and mother and lots of people t:uk of Wm. P.

Was the deed of Canfield, administrator of the estate of John M. Henrie, to R. B. Russell, admissible in evidence?</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">2. Upon the trial, the court held that the deed executed by J. M. Henrie\u2014who will be designated as the Louisiana Henrie, to distinguish him from the San Augustine John M. Henrie\u2014to Josiah Bell was void on its face, and thereby deprived the defendants of the right to rely upon the deed in support of their defense of the five-year statute of limitations. Was such ruling correct?</p>\n<p id=\"b579-6\"><bracketnum>[1]</bracketnum> As to the first question: The recitations of the administrator\u2019s deed disclosed that the sale of the land in controversy was made at the courthouse in San Augustine county; and the court held that, since the land was situated in Jefferson (now Orange) county, the sale, in the absence of an order of the probate court otherwise directing, could only lawfully be made in the county last named, to- wit, the county of Jefferson. In construing the Acts of the Republic of Texas of January 21, 1841, February 4, 1841, and January 27, 1842, the court in its charge observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-7\">\u201cThe statutes I have read fail <em>to </em>state in any positive way that the sale shall be made in the county where the lands are located; but the Supremo Court of the state, in construing the various statutes, have read into them their understanding of them, and it has become the law since then that valid sales of land, unless directed to be made otherwise, whether made by an administrator or under execution, shall be made in the county where the land is located. It is recited in the administrator\u2019s deed, offered in evidence, that the sale was made <em>in </em>San Augustine county, while the land was located in Orange county. The court, therefore, informs the jury that the administrator\u2019s deed did not divest the title out of the estate of John M. Henrie,\u201d etc.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-8\">Entertaining that view of 'the law, the court held that the administrator\u2019s deed was inadmissible in evidence, and thus in effect withdrew from the jury all consideration of the probate proceedings, upon which the defendants partly relied to defeat the plaintiff\u2019s cause of action. It is apparent that, if the administrator\u2019s deed was effectual to vest in the vendors of the defendants the title of the John M. Henrie estate to the lands in controversy, the plaintiff was without right to recover. As we have shown, the deed was excluded on the ground that the sale, in the absence of an order of court otherwise directing, should have been made in Jefferson county, for the reason that the land was there located. In its charge to the jury the court did not refer specifically to any decisions of the courts of. Texas sustaining the ruling; nor have counsel for the plaintiff called to our attention any case which invalidated an administrator\u2019s sale of land, made at the courthouse door of the county in which the administration proceeding was pending, or in the county where the sale took place, solely because it was not made in the county where the land was situated. It is an express direction of the act of 1842 that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-9\">\u201cAll sales of land * * * shall be made at the courthouse door of the county in which the sales take place.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-11\">Arid by the act of January 21, 1841, it is provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-12\">\u201cThat real estate shall be sold at the courthouse of the respective counties, \u25a0unless an order of court be had to .sell at some other place.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>These Acts of the Republic were under discussion by the court in Peters v. Cat\u00f3n, 6 Tex. 554. In that case the sale was made at De Kalb, a place other than the county seat, and the court, in holding the sale void, stated the question at page 557 in the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-4\">\u201cThe order of the court gave no specific directions as to the place of the sale; and the administratrix had no authority, by virtue of the decree, to expose the property to sale at any other than the place and the time fixed by law; and the question is whether, for the failure to comply with the requisites of the law in the particulars specified, the sale is void and conferred no title.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">This decision was rendered in 1851, only a few years after the passage of the acts construed by the court, and it appeared that the sale was not made at the courthouse of any county, nor was there an order of court directing it to be made elsewhere. While the court held the sale in the circumstances void, it was further observed by the Chief Justice at page 559:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b580-6\">\u201cThat an executor or administrator, in making sales of property, must comply in all essential particulars with the statutory provisions regulating the subject-matter, is well settled. Otherwise, those whose interests are affected, will not be concluded by the sale (7 Mass. 488), unless from a long acquiescence a compliance with the requisites of the law may be inferred.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b580-7\">In addition to Peters v. Caton, counsel for the plaintiff rely, among others, upon Howard v. North, 5 Tex. 310, 51 Am. Dec. 769, Alred v. Montague, 26 Tex. 735, 84 Am. Dec. 603, Casseady v. Norris, 49 Tex. 613, and Sinclair v. Stanley, 64 Tex. 72, which were sales made by sheriffs and United States marshals in counties other than those in which the lands were located. In those and similar cases the sales were held void, and doubtless quite properly so; but they are scarcely pertinent to the present inquir)c The principal question which confronts us in the present case is whether, after the lapse of nearly 70 years, the court will indulge presumptions to sustain the validity of the sale made by the administrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-8\">' Before adverting to the authorities, a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 of the salient points of the testimony, as disclosed by the record, will prove useful.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-9\">John M. Henrie died in 1839. After his death applications to administer upon his estate were made by his surviving wife and by James Tabor. The order appointing Mrs. Henrie administratrix was subsequently canceled. On January 14, 1844, A. W. Canfield of San Augustine county, filed an application in the probate court, reciting the death of James Tabor, and applying for the. appointment as administrator de bonis non of the Henrie estate, and an order was duly entered appointing Canfield administrator. After taking the usual oath, letters of administration were duly issued to Canfield. On January 23, 1844, Canfield, as administrator, applied to the court for authority to sell land belonging to the estate; and on June 24, 1844, an order was duly entered by the court authorizing the sale. Canfield, as administrator, sold the land in controversy on April 7, 1846, and executed a deed to Robert B. Russell to the same for a consideration of $368. The acknowledgment of the deed from Canfield to Russell was taken before the chief justice of San Augustine county on the day of the sale. On April 8th, the day following the sale, Canfield filed his report in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>probate court of the sale made by him to Russell. On February 30, 1847, Mrs. Priscilla A. Duffield, former wife of John M. Henrie, applied to the probate court of San Augustine county for a widow\u2019s allowance out of the estate, and her application was allowed therefor. There is nothing in the record to show that Mrs. Duffield ever obtained from the estate the allowance applied for. On January 27, 1847, the following order was entered in the minutes of the probate court of San Augustine county:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AKVX\">\u201cThe Estate of John M. Henrie.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-5\">\u201cIt is considered by the court that the report this day made by A. W. Can-field of his administration of said estate bo recorded.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">It is further shown by the record that on May 2, 1846, Russell conveyed the land to Canfield for a recited consideration of $1,000, and on June 5, 1846, Canfield conveyed to Daniel McLeod for $2,750. The present suit was filed October 15, 1913, and prior to its institution McLeod's heirs brought suit against the defendants to recover the land. Pending that litigation, on January 27, 1913, the heirs executed, by way of compromise, a deed to the defendants, by which the latter acquired such title as passed by the deed from Canfield, administrator, to Russell. It is further shown by the record that no open claim to the land has been made by Mrs. Duffield or her heirs from 1847 until just before the present suit was filed in 1913, covering a period of over 60 years, nor have any taxes been paid on the land by the plaintiff either before or after her assertion of claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-7\">What rule should be applied to the foregoing facts? The courts of Texas supply a conclusive answer. However, before proceeding to the authorities, and in this connection, it may be said that the sale made by Canfield to Russell was conceded to be in all respects legally sufficient, except that counsel for the plaintiff contended it was invalid, because not made in Jefferson county where the land was situated. This contention necessarily presupposes the nonexistence of an order by the probate court to make it in San Augustine county. And, narrowing the question, if there was an order of court authorizing the sale in the last-named county, or, if such an order may be presumed in view of the long lapse of time and other facts and circumstances appearing of record, it would naturally follow that the sale was valid and vested the title of the Henrie estate in Russell, the purchaser.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-8\">Let us now refer to the decisions of the Texas courts. In Baker v. Coe, 20 Tex. at page 435, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-9\">\u201cThe question upon this appeal is whether the curator\u2019s sale and deed, of the 15th o/ November, 1834, was rightly held by <em>the </em>court valid and effectual to pass and vest title in the purchaser. And we are of opinion that it was. It was executed before the judge, mid it therefore evidences Ms authorization and approval <em>o\u00ed the </em>sale. It is to be deemed in the nature, in so far, of a judicial act, and affords prima facie evidence, at least, of the truth of the facts it recites. It affords all the proof that ought, at this day, to be required of the legality of the sale.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-10\">And at page 437 the court used the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-11\">\u201cThe absence of the order of sale in this case, as was said by the same court in a later case, \u2018when applied to these ancient proceedings, raises but a remote presumption, which we hold to be subordinate to the violent legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>presumption that the judge before whom the proceedings were had did his duty.\u2019 3 Ann. 147. We have heretofore had occasion to notice with what indulgence the courts of other states have regarded the proceedings of their courts of probate, when it was proposed to annul titles fairly acquired under' them, because their records did not show a compliance with all the requirements of the law in respect to the disposition of the estates of deceased persons. Burdett v. Silsbee and Dancy v. Stricklinge, 15 Tex. 557 [65 Am. Dee. 179]; Soye\u2019s Heirs v. Maverick, 18 Tex. 100. Presumptions must be indulged in favor of those proceedings, especially when they are ancient, and titles have been acquired and transmitted under them, or it would indeed be true that time, instead of healing, as it should, the ^defects of these titles, would gradually undermine, and eventually destroy them. The judgment is affirmed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-4\">It was said by the court in Neill v. Cody, 26 Tex. 290;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-5\">\u201cA confirmation of the sale, or something from which a confirmation might be inferred, or, at least, something done by the purchaser giving him the right to have the sale confirmed, must have been shown to enable him to claim title under it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-6\">See, also, Moody v. Butler, 63 Tex, at page 212.</p>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">In Robertson v. Johnson, 57 Tex. 66, it was said by the court;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-8\">\u201cTo constitute a valid sale of land by a guardian, so as to invest title in the purchaser, it does not admit of doubt that the court must have in some way or other recognized the sale as fairly made and at a reasonable price. A formal order of court, expressly confirming the sale and directing title to be made, is not essential. But if such acts are shown upon the part of the court as would satisfy the jury that the court recognized and acquiesced in it as a completed sale, when the purchase money had been paid and the deed executed, they might infer a confirmation by the court. Under the instruction given, the jury might well have drawn the conclusion that the burden was upon the appellants to satisfy them in some way that a formal order of confirmation had been made by the court. While a confirmation is essential to the validity of such sales, owing to the lo\u00f3se and irregular manner in which such business has heretofore been conducted in our probate courts, in the very nature of things considerable indulgence in presumptions must be allowed in support of the proceedings of these courts.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">In Cruse v. O\u2019Gwin, 48 Tex. Civ. App. 52, 106 S. W. at page 759, the Court of Civil Appeals, while holding in that case that there was no confirmation of the sale, and nothing from which a confirmation could be inferred, and nothing done by the purchaser giving him the right to have the sale confirmed, used this language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-10\">\u201cEven though there was no entry in the record books of the probate court tending to show that an order of sale was issued to the permanent administrator, or tending to show an approval of the sale made by him, still, if there was anything written on any paper filed in the case in the probate court that directly or indirectly indicated approval of the sale by the probate, court, we would sustain its validity under the authority of decisions of the Supreme Court. Neill v. Cody, 26 Tex. 286; Moody v. Butler, 63 Tex. 210.\u201d'</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-11\">And in Pendleton v. Shaw, 18 Tex. Civ. App. 456, 44 S. W. at page 1010, it was said by the Court of Civil Appeals:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-12\">\u201cIf any confirmations of sale were required at the date of the sales, the evidence shows compliance in approving the account of the administrator showing the sale. Ferguson v. Templeton (Tex. Civ. App.) 32 S. W. 148-151; Bartlett v. Cocke, 15 Tex. 471. It is sufficient confirmation if the court recognized sales. Robertson v. Johnson, 57 Tex. 66; Moody v. Butler, 63 Tex. 212; Neill v. Cody, 26 Tex. 289. All reasonable presumptions will be indulged, in favor of these ancient deeds, that everything necessary to be done to perfect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>the sale was properly done, if nothing appears to impeach its fairness. White v. Jones, 67 Tex. 638-640, 4 S. W. 161, and authorities cited; Bartlett v. Cocke, supra.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-4\">In Turner v. Pope, 137 S. W. at page 423, the court held as follows ;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-5\">\u201cAt the time this sale was made, the law governing administrator\u2019s sales in the republic of Texas did not require such sales to be confirmed by the probate court, there being no statute requiring such confirmation until 1846. Harris v. Brower, 3 Tex. Civ. App. 649, 22 S. W. 758; Williams v. Cessna, 43 Tex. Civ. App. 315, 95 S. W. 1106. If the law was otherwise, we think the record in this case shows a sufficient order of confirmation by the court ordering the sale. In the absence of any statute requiring such order to be made in open court, and entered in the minutes of the court, any memorandum of the probate judge, made by him officially, which shows that he approved the sale made by the administrator should be held sufficient. The record shows that the judge of the court that ordered the sale took the acknowledgment of the administrator to the deed conveying the property to the purchaser at such sale, and the certificate of acknowledgment, made and signed by him officially, after proper recitation of the acknowledgment of the deed by the administrator, contains the following: \u2018It is therefore decreed that the foregoing deed be according to law.\u2019 Such an order was no necessary part of the certificate of acknowledgment, and should not be presumed to have been made by the judge in his capacity of an ex officio notary public, but in his judicial capacity, and was intended as a judicial approval and confirmation of the sale.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">It was said by Judge Pleasants, speaking for the Court of Appeals in Ferguson v. Templeton, 32 S. W. at page 151:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-7\">\u201cWe think the order, taken with the application referred to in the order, is sufficiently definite to validate the act of the administrator in making the sale; <em>and, </em>while there is no formal order of the court confirming the sale, the approval of the final account of the administrator, and his discharge and that of his sureties, is, in our judgment, a substantial compliance with the law requiring an order of confirmation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">In Perry v. Blakey, 5 Tex. Civ. App. <em>336, 23 S. W. </em>at page 807, the following language was employed by the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b583-9\">\u201cAt the time of the trial the deed in question was 41 years old. It had stood all these years minssailcd by the parties interested in the estate. The administration under which it was made was shown to have been carelessly carried on, and it is not likely at this late date that full proof can be made of the probate proceedings. It is the policy of the law to uphold the proceedings of our probate courts. They are courts of record of general jurisdiction in all matters relating to administration of estates of deceased persons, and its judgments in such administration of estates, intrusted to its control by law, are to be regarded, in collateral actions attacking their validity, as entitled to the same presumptions as the judgments of any other court of record of general jurisdiction. Guilford v. Love, 49 Tex. 719.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b583-10\">See, also, Dancy v. Stricklinge, 15 Tex. 557, 65 Am. Dec. 179.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-11\">Authorities upon the question might be multiplied, but it is useless to refer to others.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-12\">In the case before us the administrator reported the sale to the court the day after it was made, and the chief justice of the county (presiding judge of the probate court) took the acknowledgment to the administrator\u2019s deed. Without more, after the lapse of more than 60 years, the court may readily indulge two presumptions: (1) A ratification and confirmation of the sale; and (2) an order duly made by the probate court authorizing the administrator to sell the land in San <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>Augustine county. Upon reason, and in view of the foregoing authorities, we entertain n\u00f3 doubt that the sale made by the administrator to Russell was valid, and that it vested in the latter the title of the Henrie estate to the land in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-4\"><bracketnum>[2]</bracketnum> As to the second question: Did the court err in holding that the deed from the Louisiana J. M. Henrie to Josiah Bell was void as a matter of law. We deem it unnecessary to enter upon an elaborate discussion of this phase of the case. Unless this deed was a forgery, the defendants could have availed themselves of it, with the other incidents which the law prescribes, as a defense under the five-year statute of limitations. Hunter v. Nichols, 55 Tex. at page 230, and authorities cited. Apart from the fact that the Louisiana Henrie executed the deed to Josiah Bell, the record is silent as to his identity. Who he was, whence he came, or whither he went, we are not informed. .It may be that he soldtland to which he was not entitled, although having the same name as the John M. Henrie of San Augustine, Tex. But, be that as it may, we are of opinion that the issue of forgery vel non should have been, under appropriate instructions, submitted to the jury, particularly since a part of the land in controversy has been for nearly 50 years in possession of some of the defendants, who, during that long period, have claimed title under the Louisiana Henrie deed.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">It follows from what has been said that the ruling of the court in reference to the two deeds mentioned was erroneous. The suit Was brought by the plaintiff against sundry defendants to recover 1,107 acres of land. Following the verdict, judgment was rendered in favor of all defendants except W. H. Stark, B. D. Harris, and C. E. Slade. These three defendants asserted ownership of 397 acres off the north side of the grant, and as to them judgment went in favor of the plaintiff. The present contest is confined solely to the plaintiff, on the one hand, and to the three named defendants, on the other; and that view of the controversy seems to be conceded by counsel. As the case stands, the sole issue for future determination is as to the ownership of the 397 acres. The judgment should therefore be permitted to stand as to all the defendants, except W. H. Stark, B D. Harris, and C. E. Slade, and as to them it should be reversed, and the cause remanded for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">\u25a0Ordered accordingly.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b578-15\"> Note.\u2014Por convenience the plaintiffs in error, defendants below, will be \u25a0 referred to as defendants, and the defendant in error, plaintiff below, as plain-stiff.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
