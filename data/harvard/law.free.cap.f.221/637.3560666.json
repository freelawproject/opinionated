Upon one face of this material a panel is raised by an embossing process, said panel upon its face representing accurately the pattern and weave of the textile fabric which it is intended to represent. The colors which appear in the fabric may be shown by printing them on the panels. By this improved sample card the patentee states that he almost entirely does away with the practice of cutting up textile materials and attaching them to cards, which has long been the practice for pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>ducing sample cards of this nature, and at a great saving of time and material.</p>\n<p id=\"b652-4\">The claims are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-5\">\u201c1. A sample card, for displaying samples in tlie similitude of textile fabrics, \u25a0comprising a body portion and an embossed panel struck up from said body portion, having a surface forming a replica of a sample of textile material.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-6\">\u201c2. A sample card for displaying samples in the similitude of textile fabrics, \u25a0comprising a body portion and an embossed panel struck up from said body portion, having a surface forming a replica of a sample of textile material and sharply defined edges raised above the body portion a distance substantially equaling the thickness of a sample of textile material.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-7\">\u201c3. A' sample card for displaying samples in the similitude of textile fabrics, \u25a0comprising a body portion and an embossed panel struck up from said body portion, forming a replica of a sample of textile material, and a sample of textile material attached to said sample card.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-8\">\u201c4. A sample card for displaying samples in the similitude of textile fabrics, comprising a body portion and a plurality of embossed panels struck up therefrom, representing replicas of samples\u2019 of textile material differing in pattern from each other, and arranged symmetrically with relation to each \u25a0other.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-9\">\u201c5. A sample card for displaying a sample in the similitude of textile fabric, having struck up thereon a replica of a sample of the textile material to be \u25a0displayed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b652-10\">\u2018\u20186. A sample card for displaying .a sample in the similitude of a textile fabric, said card having a surface corresponding to the characteristic weave of the pattern of the fabric, and being colored in correspondence with the \u25a0color and design of the fabric.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b652-11\">The specifications are very plain and explicit; they point out clearly what the patented improvement is. The sample card of the patent is one in which the panels representing the samples of the various fabrics, or at least parts of such panels, are raised, struck up, or embossed, so that each panel presents \u201ca replica of a piece of goods,\u201d showing not only the pattern, but also the weave of the fabric. Thus we find the phrases \u201craised by an embossing process,\u201d panels having \u201csharply defined marginal edges,\u201d \u201cedges raised above the body portion a distance substantially equal to the thickness of a piece of textile fabric.\u201d The drawings, especially Figure 2, show the same thing. Witnesses for complainant, in describing the sample cards, say that \u201cthe effect is as though samples of cloth had been pasted on\u201d; that sometimes \u201cpersons mistook the embossing, for actual samples of goods,\u201d and \u201ctried to lift them\u201d; that they showed \u201cexactly the weave.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b652-12\">Claims 1, 2, 3, and 4 include as an element the \u201cembossed\u201d panel. Claim 5 states that the replica of the sample of textile fabric is \u201cstruck up.\u201d We should suppose that a surface with a panel \u201cstruck up\u201d is one with a panel \u201cembossed,\u201d but there may be some other way of striking up. This claim would cover a panel of the sort described in the specifications, whether it were raised by embossing or by striking up in some other way; but the raised panel is an element, however produced. Claim 6 covers a card in which the pattern or design of the fabric is shown by colors, and the \u201ccharacteristic weave\u201d of the pattern is shown by having \u201ca surface corresponding thereto.\u201d No way of producing such a surface is shown or indicated in the patent, except by embossing or striking up portions of the body of the card. Possibly a similar surface might be produced by moulding onto the top surface <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>of the card a replica of the characteristic weave. All the claims include as an element the \u201cembossed\u201d panel or panel showing the <em>weave </em>of the fabric, otherwise than merely by depicting it in colors flatly on a flat surface.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-3\">On the record it seems to us that the trial court properly held that the patent, as thus construed, was valid. Nothing like it is shown, in the record here presented, as prior art. In the single exhibit produced as the sole sample of defendant\u2019s device, the pattern or design is shown by colors, but the \u201ccharacteristic weave\u201d of the fabric is not shown in the way indicated in the patent, by embossing or striking up \u201cpanels\u201d or other portions of the. surface of the card. The entire surface of the finished article is flat; there are no corrugations of any sort to indicate weave. Surely no one looking at it would believe that he was looking at natural pieces of cloth mounted on the cards.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-4\">Complainant\u2019s expert testified that in Exhibit B (defendant\u2019s card) he finds the structure called for in claim 6. But the context shows that he means claim 6 as he construes it. As we construe it differently, we reach a different conclusion as to infringement. It is true that the second assignment of error is to holding infringement of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 (not including 6); but assignment No. 3 is generally to the refusal to deny motion for preliminary injunction, which is broad enough.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-5\">There seems to be some understanding by the expert witnesses that defendant\u2019s cards are produced by a process of \u201cembossing\u201d; that the way in which colors, paper, and tools are placed and pressed together is embossing, although the result is a flat surface, presenting a different appearance to the eye than does the surface of plaintiff\u2019s cards. We are satisfied, however, that the \u201cembossing\u201d of the patent is an \u201cembossing\u201d which produces the effect which the patent describes and claims. It is the product,,, not the process, which is patented, and a process, whether it he <em>called </em>embossing, or not, which does not result in that product, does not produce an infringement of these six claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b653-6\">The order is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
