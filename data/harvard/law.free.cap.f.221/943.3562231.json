The question now presented is whether 400 cars upon which no royalty or license fee has been paid and which are known as types B, C and D, infringed the claims of the patent. At the close of the testimony each side moved the court to direct a verdict. The trial judge says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b957-18\">\"Had the patent contained only the narrow claims of a partition as a <em>means </em>to accomplish this, I should have hardly been justified In saying that they covered these structures, but claims one and eight are in very broad terms; indeed, they cover any such system which has a \u2018space\u2019 between the doorways, if the rest of the structure secured the purposes set forth. I am not disposed, at least in view of the form of claim eight and the originality of the idea as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>a whole, to press the interpretation of the word \u2018between\u2019 so narrowly as the defendant requires. I include claims one and two with a good deal of hesitation, but as nothing turns upon whether they are included or not, it is not necessary to labor that feature.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b958-4\">Claims 1 and 8 are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b958-5\">\u201c1. A passenger ear provided with separate entrance and exit on the Same platform providing a space between the doorways for the purposes described.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b958-6\">\u201c8. In a passenger ear having a rear platform and exit and entrance doorways between car and platform a space between exit and entrance doorways adopted to accommodate the conductor for the purposes described.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b958-7\">In vi'ew of. what we have said in the Orange County Case, we think a broad construction of these claims is out of the question. In each of the eight claims as originally filed nothing was said about a space between the doorways. The first claim was in these words, \u201cA passenger car provided with separate entrance and exit on the same platform.\u201d Such a car was clearly anticipated by several structures of the prior art. Amended claims were proposed, in which the new element was \u201ca space between the doorways.\u201d This new element is found in every claim and cannot .be ignored. A platform which does not have this space or partition .does not infringe and the defendant\u2019s cars do not have it. There is no \u201cspace,\u201d as that word is used in -the- claims, but merely a.post similar to those shown in the prior art. It seems to us a wholly unwarranted construction to assert that the defendant\u2019s cars now in controversy have the intervening space or partition required by the claims of the patent.</p>\n<p id=\"b958-8\">The judgment is reversed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
