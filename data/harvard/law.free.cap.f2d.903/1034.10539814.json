Robertson against the United States of America seeking a refund of a tax paid by the estate. The district court entered an order denying the refund upon determining that the Internal Revenue Service had properly disallowed a certain marital deduction. The sole issue presented for our review is whether the bequest from the testatrix, Claudia M. Robertson, to her husband, Ernest Robertson, was a terminable interest under section 2056 of the Internal Revenue Code. If so, the gift cannot qualify as a marital deduction for estate tax purposes. We answer the question in the affirmative and thus affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-24\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-25\">The facts in the present case were uncontested. The decedent, Claudia M. Robertson (Mrs. Robertson), died testate on September 10, 1984. At that time, she was residing in Texas, and her will had been drafted in accordance with the laws of Texas.</p>\n<p id=\"b1103-26\">Mrs. Robertson was survived by her husband, Ernest Robertson (Mr. Robertson), and two daughters, Virginia R. Mattson and Carolyn R. Ohl. Mr. Robertson, who authored the will, qualified as executor of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1036\">*1036</page-number>the Robertson estate (the Estate). Under the will, all of Mrs. Robertson\u2019s separate property passed to her two daughters. The residuary estate was left to her husband, \u201cwithout restriction or reservation\u201d in section III of the will. However, the second paragraph of section III contained the following language:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1104-4\">Should my husband, Ernest M. Robertson, not survive me, <em>or should he die before this will is admitted to probate, </em>then <em>and in that event only, </em>I give, devise and bequeath all of the residue and remainder of my property and estate to my two daughters, Virginia R. Matt-son and Carolyn R. Ohl, share and share alike, without restriction or reservation.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1104-5\">The Robertson Estate filed a federal estate tax return in which it claimed a marital deduction under section 2056 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) with respect to the property devised to Mr. Robertson. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) disallowed the deduction, determining that the interest conveyed was a terminable one and assessed a deficiency against the Estate for $229,446.26 ($187,600.79 in actual deficiency and $41,845.47 in interest). The Estate paid this amount and immediately filed a claim for refund. The claim was denied, and the Estate brought the present action in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-6\">The district court agreed with the IRS that the interest was terminable under section 2056 and entered an order denying the refund claim. The Estate then filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-8\">Pursuant to section 2056 of the IRC, a surviving spouse may claim a marital deduction for estate tax purposes covering certain property interests passed to him through the will of the decedent spouse. However, some exceptions exist to this general rule. For example, if the interest bequeathed is contingent upon the occurrence or non-occurrence of a certain event, it is deemed a non-deductible, terminable interest. I.R.C. \u00a7 2056(b)(1954). However, subsection (b)(3) of section 2056 specifically addresses devises conditioned only upon the actual survival of the surviving spouse. I.R.C. \u00a7 2056(b)(3). That subsection provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1104-11\">[a]n interest passing to the surviving spouse shall not be considered as an interest which will terminate or fail on the death of such spouse if\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1104-12\">(A) such death will cause a termination or failure of such interest only if it occurs within a period not exceeding 6 months after the decedent\u2019s death ...; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1104-13\">(B) such termination or failure does not in fact occur.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1104-14\">The government contends that the language in section III of Mrs. Robertson\u2019s will created only a terminable interest in Mr. Robertson; thus, it disallowed the marital deduction claimed by the Estate. In response, the Estate points to various presumptions in the Texas Probate Code in support of its position that the interest was not terminable, in that it fell within the six-month exception of section 2056(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1104-15\">The Estate primarily argues that the clause \u201cor should [Mr. Robertson] die before this will is admitted to probate\u201d was so intertwined with the clause conditioning the gift upon the survival of Mr. Robertson that Mrs. Robertson\u2019s intent was simply that Mr. Robertson survive her death only a short while. Because the intent of the testator is the predominate focus of the Texas probate courts, <em>Sharp v. Broadway Nat\u2019l Bank, </em>761 S.W.2d 141, 144 (Tex.App. \u2014San Antonio 1988), <em>aff'd as modified, </em>784 S.W.2d 669 (Tex.1990), and because the totality of the circumstances allegedly indicates that Mrs. Robertson\u2019s intent was that Mr. Robertson survive her only by a few months (i.e., less than six), the Estate concludes that the devise fell within the six-month exception to the terminable interest rule.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> To support this position, the Robert<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1037\">*1037</page-number>son estate points to the punctuation and grammar used in the drafting of the will and to extrinsic evidence as to Mrs. Robertson\u2019s experience and understanding of the length of time necessary to probate a will.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1105-4\">The Estate argues that the will was drafted (and thus was understood by Mrs. Robertson) in such a way so as to make the clause \u201cor should he die before this will is admitted to probate\u201d a superfluous or nonessential one. The Estate makes this very creative argument with support from rules and books of English grammar. Essentially, it contends that the fact that the clause is set off by paired commas indicates the intent of the testator that the clause was not an essential condition to fulfill in order to receive the devise.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This intent, the Estate claims, is further evidenced by the subsequent clause \u201cin <em>that </em>event only\u201d (as contrasted with \u201cin <em>those </em>events only\u201d), which was employed to make the devise as unrestrictive as possible. Furthermore, the Estate points out that Mrs. Robertson devised the entire gift \u201cwithout reservation or restriction\u201d to Mr. Robertson, indicating that she intended to make as few limitations upon the gift as possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-5\">The Estate then sets forth several principles of will construction in Texas probate law that correspond with Mrs. Robertson\u2019s \u201cplain intent.\u201d First of all, there is a rule that the probate court is to adopt a construction of the will so as to favor the \u201cfirst taker\u201d \u2014 Ernest in the present case\u2014 if there is any doubt as to the testatrix\u2019 intent. <em>Zint v. Crofton, </em>563 S.W.2d 287, 290 (Tex.App. \u2014 Amarillo 1977, writ ref\u2019d n.r.e.). Secondly, there is a rule favoring the vesting of title at the earliest possible moment. <em>Id. </em>at 291. Finally, another rule of construction mandates that a fee simple be conveyed with as few restrictions as possible. This last rule even takes precedence over the rule that every part of a will must be given effect. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1105-11\">All of the rules as set forth by the Estate are valid rules of will construction in Texas. However, more emphasis must be given to the testatrix\u2019 expressed intent than that accorded by the Estate\u2019s argument. When a bequest is explicitly conditioned upon survival until a specified event \u2014 such as the admission of the will into probate \u2014 such language cannot be ignored unless it is \u201cclearly illegal or clearly contrary to the general intention of the testator.\u201d <em>Marlin v. Kelly, </em>678 S.W.2d 582, 587 (Tex.App. \u2014 Houston [14th Dist.] 1984), <em>aff'd, </em>714 S.W.2d 303 (Tex.1986). The language of Mrs. Robertson\u2019s will creates two unambiguous conditions that must be fulfilled in order for Mr. Robertson to receive the devise, namely that he survive the testatrix\u2019 death and that he survive until the will\u2019s admission to probate. Because, under the Texas Probate Code, the will could have been admitted to probate more than six months after Mrs. Robertson\u2019s death,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we hold that the contingency does not fall within the safe harbour of section 2056(b)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b1105-12\">Our holding today is consistent with the views in the Second and Eighth Circuits. In <em>Hansen v. Vinal, </em>413 F.2d 882, 886 (8th Cir.1969), the Eighth Circuit was also con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1038\">*1038</page-number>fronted with a clause in a decedent\u2019s will conditioning the devise upon survival until the will\u2019s probate. The estate in that ease made a similar argument to that of the Robertson Estate, contending that the probate condition \u201crelated back\u201d to the mere survival clause. The Eighth Circuit found the argument unpersuasive, concluding that the two clauses constituted separate and alternative conditions. In <em>In re Estate of Fried, </em>445 F.2d 979, 981 (2d Cir.1971), <em>cert. denied, </em>404 U.S. 1016, 92 S.Ct. 676, 30 L.Ed.2d 663 (1972), the Second Circuit was also faced with a devise in a will that conveyed a residual estate with the following limitation: \u201c... or in the event that my said beloved wife survives me but dies before the probate of this my Last Will and Testament, then ... I give ... the whole of said rest ... to my daughter.\u201d Although this clause was more artfully drafted as an express condition, it demonstrates the same intention as is expressed in Mrs. Robertson's will. The Second Circuit in <em>Fried </em>rejected an argument that the additional clause simply defined the mere survival clause, stating that \u201cthe intent was to create two separate conditions: that the widow not die in a common disaster <em>and </em>that she not die before probate.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 982 (emphasis in original); <em>see also Silvey v. United States, </em>265 F.Supp. 235, 237 (N.D.Ala.1966); <em>Estate of Geraldine Harmon, </em>84 T.C. 329 (1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-4\">The Robertson Estate makes an alternative argument that extrinsic evidence regarding Mrs. Robertson\u2019s knowledge of and experience with the length of time necessary to probate a will should have been considered. The Estate first contends that it was error for the district court not to have considered extrinsic evidence as to Mrs. Robertson\u2019s experience and understanding at the time she signed the will even if the will were unambiguous, citing <em>Stewart v. Selder, </em>473 S.W.2d 3, 7 (Tex.1971) for this proposition. The Estate \u201cmaintains that such circumstances were quite material in determining what [Mrs. Robertson] meant with respect to the question of her intention.\u201d However, the <em>Stewart </em>case also points out that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1106-5\">[t]he intention of the testator must be found, in the last analysis, in the words of the will, and for that reason his other declarations of intention dealing with the subject of the specific document are generally not admissible. These declarations may be received <em>only </em>as an aid <em>in resolving certain specific problems of interpretation such as equivocation and latent ambiguity.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1106-6\"><em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). In light of such jurisprudence, we are not prepared to say that the district court erred in refusing to consider the extrinsic evidence after it concluded the will was unambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-7\">Additionally, the Estate claims that the extrinsic evidence should have been considered to clear up the ambiguities in the will. The district court dismissed the ambiguity claim, stating that the Robertson Estate \u201cdoes not argue that the will is ambiguous and therefore the Court will not go beyond [the specific terms of the will].\u201d On appeal, however, the Estate contends that it did assert the problem of the will\u2019s alleged ambiguity in its trial brief. While conceding that it did not employ the precise term \u201cambiguous,\u201d the Estate nonetheless contends that it expressed a similar intent by pointing out several apparent \u201clogical conflicts\u201d occurring within the four corners of the will. Moreover, it contends, the will <em>was </em>in fact ambiguous with respect to the testatrix\u2019 intent as to the clause regarding survival until probate. Because the testatrix used the words \u201cin <em>that </em>event\u201d (emphasis added) directly after the clause in conflict (apparently implying by use of the singular that only <em>one </em>of the events was relevant), and because she purported to give the estate \u201cwithout reservation or restriction\u201d (as such, indicating that she intended to place as few limits as possible on the gift), the Estate concludes that the textatrix\u2019 intent as to the second contingency \u2014 that Mr. Robertson survive the admission of her will into probate \u2014 is ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b1106-8\">We do not read the document in this manner. The terms of the will include <em>two </em>express contingencies that could serve to divest Mr. Robertson of his devise. Because the second of those contingencies could have taken place more than six <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1039\">*1039</page-number>months after the death of the decedent under Texas probate law, as discussed <em>supra, </em>the district court correctly ruled that the marital deduction under section 2056 of the IRC was not available to the petitioner in this case. As such, it accordingly refused to grant a refund. As stated by the Eighth Circuit in <em>Hansen, </em>\u201c[t]he result we reach may be harsh, but is required by statute.\u201d 413 F.2d at 887.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1107-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1104-9\">. The Estate also makes an analogy between the testatrix\u2019 intent and the 120 hour statutory period set forth in section 47 of the Texas Probate Code. Because that contemporaneous death statute was enacted after Mrs. Robertson\u2019s will was drafted, the Estate contends that the statutory result was exactly what she was trying to achieve through the probate proviso in the will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1037\">*1037</page-number>\u2014\u201c[s]uch a relatively short time period was ... what Claudia [Robertson] had in mind in the second paragraph of such Section III.\"</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1105-7\">. The Estate points out that Mr. Robertson, the testatrix\u2019 husband of 40 years, was an attorney and state district judge. Based upon his experience, she was under the impression that a will went to probate within three months of the death of the testator. In fact, her own will was probated less than a month after her death.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1105-8\">. Although the parties disagree as to whether the use of punctuation is a relevant inquiry in Texas probate law, we do not find this debate a productive exercise. Although punctuation could be useful in ascertaining intent, such inquiry would still be subordinate to the rule that the testatrix has placed nothing superfluous or meaningless in the will. <em>Marlin v. Kelly, </em>678 S.W.2d 582, 587 (Tex.App. \u2014 Houston [14th Dist.] 1984), <em>aff'd, </em>714 S.W.2d 303 (Tex.1986).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1105-14\">.In Texas, admission of will to probate occurs only upon entry of a court order after a hearing. Tex.Prob.Code Ann. \u00a7 89 (Vernon Supp.1990). That event could have taken place more than six months after Mrs. Robertson\u2019s death, so long as it was within a four-year window. <em>See </em>Tex. Prob.Code Ann. \u00a7 73 (Vernon 1990). Additionally, it was an event not within Mr. Robertson\u2019s control. Thus, there was no assurance that admission to probate would have occurred within the six month exception period.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
