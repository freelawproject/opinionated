Its brief states that no facts are in dispute. There was a fire in Heidelberg Township\u2014about 9 miles from Stowe Township \u2014of such magnitude as to result in \u201c a general alarm or call for help.\u201d The chief of police of Stowe Township received the call and advised Eckert, who was chief of the volunteer fire department of the township, of the call; Eckert ordered two of his companies to go to the fire. Claimant\u2019s husband was a member of one of the companies so ordered, and was instructed by Eckert \u201cto go on No. 2 truck and show them the road.\u201d He complied and after having gone about two miles. from the Stowe Township line, the truck left the road and upset; a number of firemen were injured and several were killed. Proceedings under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act were brought against Stowe Township on behalf of all claimants and were opposed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>by the township\u2019s insurance carrier. In the first instance, it was contended by the insurer that the statute was unconstitutional, and that in any event, the fireman was an employee loaned' by Stowe Township to Heidelberg Township. Both contentions seem to have been -abandoned, and the questions involved are now in appellant\u2019s brief stated to be; 1, the authority of the chief, Eckert, \u201cto send a fire company outside the limits of Stowe Township;\u201d and 2, whether \u201ca volunteer fireman [is] an employee\u201d under the Act of May 14, 1925, P. L. 714, while \u201canswering a fire in a district ten or twelve miles distant\u201d in the circumstances appearing in evidence. The referee found for claimant; the board agreed, and on appeal, the common plea's affirmed and entered judgment for decedent\u2019s dependents for sums aggregating $8,102.14 payable as required by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-3\">1. Stowe Township is of the first class and has a volunteer fire department composed of four companies. Eckert was fire chief, elected by a joint meeting of the four companies. Following his election by the companies; he was (in the words of the compensation board) \u201cduly appointed [by the township-commissioners] chief of the fire department of Stowe Township '......having full authority to exercise his own- judgment in handling all fires.\u201d That finding--was based on the statement of the township clerk, a statement that was only \u201cobjected to in so far as it purports to give this man authority for\u2019 anything \u25a0 outside of Stowe Township; the\u2019 commissioners of that township- not having authority beyond its limits.\u201d An ordinance of 1906 was put in evidence, entitled \u201cAn ordinance covering the fire department and regulating the same in the management of fires in Stowe Township and providing for the election of a clerk.\u201d It provided that the fire department annually elect a chief and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>assistant chief and certify such election to the commissioners. Eckert was so chosen. There is evidence that the fire company was incorporated, though its charter was not put in the record. Eckert testified he had been given \u201cfull authority to order\u201d out any or all of the companies, and that pursuant to that authority he \u201csent two pieces [fire extinguishing apparatus] on the way to the Heidelberg fire,\u201d\u2014\u201ca combination pumper, hose and pump.\u201d As has been stated, the call to send assistance was given to him by the captain of the Stowe Township police, who received the alarm over the telephone and sounded \u201cthe siren.\u201d There is evidence by a number of witnesses that it was customary in the community for volunteer fire departments of one municipality to assist those of another; the general alarm from Heidelberg Township was given by a witness who testified that he did so pursuant to \u201corders I got from the fire marshall\u201d of Allegheny County. There is nothing in the record to contradict this evidence of general practice. On this point, the Act of May 2, 1925, P. L. 494 shows legislative recognition of a custom (of which there is evidence in this case and also in Sames v. Perkasie, 100 Pa. Superior Ct. 402, originating in early colonial times according to which volunteer fire departments of one municipality assisted those of another in emergencies: (see Scharf and Westcott\u2019s History of Philadelphia, Yol. Ill, pp. 1883, et seq.). That statute authorizes a municipality \u201cto secure insurance or compensation for voluntary firemen killed or injured while going to or returning from or attending fire in said municipality or territory adjacent thereto.\u201d As something is said by appellant about the meaning of the word \u201cadjacent\u201d it may be noted in passing that the important phrase is \u201cterritory adjacent thereto\u201d and not the word \u201cadjacent\u201d alone; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>the possible activity of the firemen was not, in legislative contemplation, limited to an \u201cadjacent\u201d municipality but to one in adjacent territory. There may of course be cases in which there may be a question whether the service was in adjacent territory, but in this case, the evidence fully supports the conclusion underlying the award that the claimant\u2019s husband was \u201cgoing to\u201d a fire in \u201cterritory adjacent\u201d to Stowe Township within the meaning of the legislation. The referee and the board are therefore supported in their finding of fact that Eckert had authority to send the two companies with their equipment to assist in extinguishing the fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-3\">2. The Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act (1915, P. L. 736) contained a definition of \u201cemployee\u201d for the purposes of the system; that definition was enlarged by the Act of May 14,1925, P. L. 714, as follows: \u201cThat in addition to those persons included within the definition of the word employee, as defined in section one hundred and four of the act to which this is a supplement, there shall be included all members of volunteer fire companies of the various cities, boroughs, incorporated towns, and townships, who shall be and are hereby declared to be employes of such cities, boroughs, incorporated towns, townships for all the purposes of said act, and shall be entitled to receive compensation in case of injuries received while actually engaged as firemen or while going to or returning from any fire which the fire companies of which they are members shall have attended.\u201d- By the act, Son-nett, a member of a volunteer fire company of Stowe Township, became an employee of the township, and he and his dependents, as defined in the act, became entitled to compensation \u201cin case of injuries received while actually engaged as fireman or' while going to ....... any fire......\u201d The evidence has beep, sufficiently stated to show that Sonnett was performing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>a fireman\u2019s duty pursuant to the instructions of Ms superior when the accident occurred; the referee and the board were therefore justified in finding that he was injured \u201c while in the course of his employment with the defendant,\u201d and died of the injury.
