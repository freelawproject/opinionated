A resident of another state who has an agent or clerk in his place of business in this Commonwealth is not exempt from process of foreign attachment (Chase v. The Ninth National Bank of New York, 56 Pa. 355); therefore, it is not a jurisdictional fact which must be alleged. \u25a0 But the plaintiff must aver the presence of the' defendant\u2019s property, real or personal, within the county at the time of the issuance of the writ, or if it is intangible property, that there is money, choses in action, etc., of the defendant in the possession of, or due or owing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>to it by, someone capable of being summoned as garnishee within the county. The omission to set forth these indispensable facts is fatal to the proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">See opinion filed this day in the case of Morinelli v. H. P.
