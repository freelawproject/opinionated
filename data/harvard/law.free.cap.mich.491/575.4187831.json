A fair-cross-section claim under the Sixth Amendment requires a defendant to make a prima facie case as set forth by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Duren v Missouri.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Namely, a defendant must show:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-11\">(1) that the group alleged to be excluded is a \u2018distinctive\u2019 group in the community; (2) that the representation of this group in venires from which juries are selected is not fair and reasonable in relation to the number of such persons in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"582\">*582</page-number>the community; and (3) that this underrepresentation is due to systematic exclusion of the group in the jury-selection process.<footnotemark>[2]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-5\">The Court of Appeals concluded that defendant had satisfied the three <em>Duren </em>prongs, establishing a violation of his right to an impartial jury drawn from a fair cross section of the community, and granted defendant a new trial. We conclude that the Court of Appeals erred because defendant failed to show under the second prong that the representation of African-Americans in venires from which juries were selected was not fair and reasonable in relation to the number of African-Americans in the community. The Court of Appeals erred in evaluating the second prong in two significant ways.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-6\">First, the Court of Appeals wrongly relied on misleading representation data by considering the representation of African-Americans <em>only </em>in defendant\u2019s venire when addressing whether representation was fair and reasonable. <em>Duren </em>explicitly requires courts to consider the representation of a distinct group in <em>venires. </em>The use of this inadequate sample from only defendant\u2019s venire caused the tests evaluating the degree of any underrepresentation to produce skewed and exaggerated results.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">Second, the Court of Appeals misapplied our decision in <em>People v Smith.</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In <em>Smith, </em>we held that an evaluation of the second prong requires courts to employ a case-by-case approach that considers <em>all </em>the relevant statistical tests for evaluating the data regarding representation of a distinct group without using any one individual method <em>exclusive </em>of the others. Contrary to this holding, the Court of Appeals effectively adopted a bright-line rule in favor of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"583\">*583</page-number>the comparative-disparity test in all instances in which the population of the distinct group is small. Given that all the relevant tests have shortcomings, <em>Smith </em>requires courts to take a comprehensive view of the degree of underrepresentation without elevating one test over the others. Nonetheless, the Court of Appeals, using a skewed result from the comparative-disparity test, elevated this test above the others in precisely the situation in which its use is most criticized \u2014 distorting the degree of underrepresentation when the population of the distinct group is small.</p>\n<p id=\"AYX\">We hold that when applying all the relevant tests for evaluating the representation data, a court must examine the composition of jury pools or venires over time using the most reliable data available to determine whether representation of a distinct group is fair and reasonable.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Having considered the results of these tests using the most reliable data set, which included the composition of jury pools or venires over a three-month period, we conclude that defendant failed to show that the representation of African-Americans was not fair and reasonable. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and reinstate defendant\u2019s convictions and sentences.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b700-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"584\">*584</page-number>I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b700-4\">A jury convicted defendant of first-degree criminal sexual conduct, MCL 750.520b(l)(e), armed robbery, MCL 750.529, and possession of marijuana, MCL 333.7403(2)(d). The victim testified that when she attempted to buy crack cocaine from defendant, he put a gun to her head and demanded her money. He then ordered her to perform oral sex on him, taking her car keys and telling her that he would not let her leave until she did so. When the police apprehended defendant, he had marijuana in his possession.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">After the jury was selected, but before it was sworn, defendant made a timely objection to the racial composition of his jury venire. The trial court noted that it observed one African-American and one Latino in defendant\u2019s 45-person venire, but decided to reserve its ruling on the objection until a hearing the following day.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">At the hearing, the jury clerk testified in regard to the procedure for composing jury pools and venires. According to the jury clerk, the Secretary of State provides the court a list of all the residents of Kent County who are at least 18 years of age and have a valid driver\u2019s license or valid state identification. From that list, a computer program randomly selects residents to be sent jury questionnaires. The program then randomly selects jurors to be summoned using the names of those who responded to the jury questionnaire and had not been disqualified or opted out of jury service because of age.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"585\">*585</page-number>The jury clerk testified that the Secretary of State database does not include the race of the individuals listed and that the computer program does not account for race when selecting jurors. For the date defendant\u2019s jury was selected, Januaiy 28,2002, only 132 of the 182 people who had been randomly selected by the computer program and issued jury summonses appeared for service. By the jury clerk\u2019s visual inspection, only one was African-American. Of the 132 appearing, the computer program randomly selected 45 people for defendant\u2019s venire. The jury clerk also submitted to the trial court the results of voluntary surveys taken by some of those actually appearing for jury duty on given days in January 2002.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">Defendant, relying on the results of the voluntary surveys, argued that the disparity of African-Americans appearing for jury duty compared to the African-American population of the county showed that the current jury-selection method did not include a fair cross section of the community. The trial court ultimately denied defendant\u2019s challenge to his venire, ruling that because the jury-selection system was race neutral, the underrepresentation of African-Americans was a function of the voluntary failure of those individuals to participate.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>Following his conviction and sentencing, defendant appealed. The Court of Appeals majority affirmed in part, but remanded the case to the trial court for an evidentiary hearing regarding defendant\u2019s claim that his venire did not reflect a fair cross section of the community.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Addressing whether the representation of the distinct group (African-Americans) was fair and reasonable under Duren\u2019s second prong, the majority concluded that defendant had not shown that the representation was not fair and reasonable under the relevant statistical tests.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Nonetheless, the majority applied the approach set forth in <em>People v Hubbard (After Remand),</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>in which \u201cthe defendant was found to have shown substantial underrepresentation where the disparity resulted from \u2018non-benign\u2019 circumstances; that is, where the underrepresentation did not occur as the result of random chance.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Under this approach, the majority assumed that defendant had satisfied the second prong because the evidence indicated the possibility that the underrepresentation was not the result of random selection.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">Regarding the third prong, the prosecution admitted that the jury-selection process disproportionately selected jurors from certain zip codes.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> As a result, the majority remanded the case to the trial court for an evidentiary hearing in which defendant could \u201cpresent evidence that the Kent County jury selection system <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>resulted in systematic exclusion of African-Americans causing this group to be substantially underrepresented in defendant\u2019s jury venire.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b703-4\">On remand, the trial court<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> held several hearings and heard testimony from the court\u2019s case manager, the jury clerk, a member of the Kent County Jury Board, and two statistical experts. From this testimony, the trial court found that a computer programming error was responsible for the underrepresentation of African-Americans in venires from June 2001 to August 2002.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">The trial court found that Kent County, in an effort to save money spent on software fees, switched in April 2001 from using a vendor\u2019s software for summoning jurors to software developed by its information technology department. Rather than drawing from the entire database<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> of 456,435 names that the Michigan Secretary of State had provided for Kent County, the new computer program had an erroneous setting using only 118,169 of those names. The program selected ran<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"588\">*588</page-number>domly who from the list of 118,169 names would be sent jury questionnaires. Because the 118,169 individuals selected came disproportionately from certain zip codes, jury questionnaires were disproportionately sent to those zip codes.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> This resulted in a disproportionately larger number of jury questionnaires going to zip codes with smaller African-American populations and disproportionately fewer questionnaires going to zip codes with larger African-American populations.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">For the week that defendant\u2019s jury was selected, the court summoned 293 people for jury service. The court specifically summoned 183 of the 293 for January 28, 2002, when defendant\u2019s jury was picked. Of the 183 people summoned, 132 appeared and 45 of them were randomly placed in defendant\u2019s venire. As noted, the court used voluntary surveys to identify the gender and race of those appearing for jury duty. All 132 potential jurors who appeared on January 28 responded to the voluntary survey, with one individual specifying African-American and one individual specifying multiracial.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">Two statistical experts testified at the hearings. First, Dr. Chidi Chidi testified as a statistical expert for defendant. He analyzed the voluntary surveys that potential jurors who appeared completed from 2001 to 2004. Relying on the results of the voluntary surveys, Dr. Chidi concluded that the standard-deviation and comparative-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"589\">*589</page-number>disparity tests proved that there had. been systematic exclusion of African-Americans from juiy duty. The trial court, however, rejected Dr. Chidi\u2019s testimony, finding that Dr. Chidi showed personal bias and a failure to understand basic statistics because he had analyzed only those individuals who opted to answer the voluntary survey after appearing for jury duty.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">Given its disapproval of Dr. Chidi\u2019s testimony, and pursuant to MRE 706,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> the trial court selected Dr. Paul Stephenson as its expert. Using data from the 2000 Census, Dr. Stephenson conducted his analysis with the assumption that the population of African-Americans old enough to serve as jurors constituted 8.25 percent of Kent County.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">From court records, Dr. Stephenson identified the number of jurors summoned from each zip code for each month from January 2002 through March 2002. Dr. Stephenson then used those records and the census data for racial population in each zip code to estimate that, as a result of the zip-code bias, only 163 of the 3,898 summonses (4.17 percent) sent out from January through March 2002 went to African-Americans. If 8.25 percent of the summonses sent out during that period had gone to African-Americans, then 322 African-Americans would have been sent them.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">Considering only defendant\u2019s venire, Dr. Stephenson calculated that the absolute disparity<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> was 6.03 percent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>and the comparative disparity<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> was 73.1 percent. However, Dr. Stephenson disregarded the results of these tests, explaining in his report that because of the small population of African-Americans in Kent County, the absolute-disparity test could not identify whether the underrepresentation was statistically significant. He further explained that small changes of representation in the venire had the effect of distorting the result of the comparative-disparity test.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">Dr. Stephenson also considered the standard-deviation test,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> but rejected the use of this test because \u201cthe normal approximation is not valid. . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Dr. Stephenson, however, applied a test analogous to the standard-deviation test, calculating the binomial distribution to determine whether the venire-selection process was valid.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> From this calculation, Dr. Stephenson concluded that there was insufficient evidence to find that African-Americans were significantly underrepresented in defendant\u2019s venire because even if there had been no bias in how the summonses were sent out, 10.477 percent of randomly selected venires would have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>had one or no African-Americans. In Dr. Stephenson\u2019s view, this likelihood was sufficient for the disparity in African-American representation to be statistically insignificant, but this conclusion was related to the small sample size when examining just defendant\u2019s venire.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-5\">Examining the larger three-month sample, Dr. Stephenson performed further calculations using the binomial results to find that there was essentially \u201cno chance\u201d that the reduced numbers of African-Americans in jury pools between January and March 2002 occurred as a result of random chance. Further, a venire selected during the time the zip-code problem occurred was approximately four times more likely to contain no more than one African-American than if this problem had not been present. He concluded that if the estimates matched actual practice, \u201ca systematic bias did exist in the selection of individuals summoned for jury duly... [that] inevitably led to the under representation\u201d of African-Americans in the jury pools from January through March 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b707-6\">In a written opinion, the trial court ruled that defendant was not entitled to a new trial because he had failed to satisfy Duren\u2019\u2019s second and third prongs. Addressing whether the representation of African-Americans was fair and reasonable, the trial court reasoned that there was no proof of actual underrepresentation in the group of individuals that the computer program identified and to whom jury questionnaires were sent because the Secretary of State database does not identify race.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> In the trial court\u2019s view, comparing an estimate of how many African-Americans were sent questionnaires and how many would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>have been sent questionnaires absent the computer program flaw was not sufficient because hard data is required under <em>Smith.</em><footnotemark><em>29</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b708-4\">The trial court also concluded that there was no systematic exclusion under Duren\u2019s third prong because there was no evidence that the defective computer setting had any bias. Rather, it simply randomly reduced the number of individuals whom jurors were selected from. Therefore, the end result \u2014 that these individuals were taken disproportionately from certain zip codes \u2014 was not inherent in the court\u2019s jury-selection processes.</p>\n<p id=\"b708-5\">On defendant\u2019s second appeal, the Court of Appeals concluded in an authored opinion that defendant had established a violation of the Sixth Amendment\u2019s fair-cross-section requirement and reversed and remanded the case for a new trial.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> The panel referred to each of the tests generally used to measure whether representation of a distinct group is fair and reasonable, purportedly following the case-by-case approach set forth in Smith,<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>First, relying on Dr. Stephenson\u2019s calculations for only defendant\u2019s venire, the panel stated that the absolute disparity was 6.03 percent. Although acknowledging that such a result does not indicate substantial underrepresentation, the panel declined to find the absolute-disparity test controlling because it viewed it as an ineffective measure of acceptable disparity in circumstances, like this one, in which the group in question makes up a small percentage of the total population.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b709-4\">Next, the panel addressed the comparative-disparity test and acknowledged the difficulties in applying this test to a group that makes up a small percentage of the population.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Nonetheless, the panel decided that the comparative-disparity test was the most appropriate to measure the underrepresentation in cases in which the percentage of the distinct group in the population is low.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Relying on Dr. Stephenson\u2019s calculations for only defendant\u2019s venire, the panel stated that the comparative disparity was 73.1 percent, which it viewed as a significant disparity and \u201csufficient to demonstrate that the representation of African-Americans in the venire for defendant\u2019s trial was unfair and unreasonable.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>In addition, the panel briefly addressed the standard-deviation test. It concluded that because Dr. Stephenson testified that the test was not appropriate because the normal approximation was not valid and no court has accepted the standard-deviation analysis as determinative in this type of challenge, it had little value here.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">Addressing the third prong from <em>Duren, </em>the panel held that the underrepresentation was caused by the systematic exclusion of African-Americans.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> The panel concluded that the underrepresentation in this case was inherent in the Kent County jury-selection process in which a computer programming error resulted in over-selection of jurors from zip codes with small minority populations and underselection of jurors from zip codes with large minority populations. Further, the evidence showed that this underrepresentation occurred over a significant period of time.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Therefore, because defendant established a prima facie case for a fair-cross-section claim under the Sixth Amendment that the prosecution failed to rebut, the panel reversed and remanded for a new trial.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b710-5\">The prosecution sought leave to appeal in this Court, which we granted.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Aix\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"595\">*595</page-number>II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b711-6\">Whether defendant was denied his Sixth Amendment right to an impartial jury drawn from a fair cross section of the community is a constitutional question that we review de novo.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> We review the factual findings of a trial court for clear error, which exists \u201cif the reviewing court is left with a definite and firm conviction that the trial court made a mistake.\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b711-7\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b711-8\">A. FAIR-CROSS-SECTION JURISPRUDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b711-9\">The Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution guarantees a defendant the right to be tried by an impartial jury drawn from a fair cross section of the community.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> The United States Supreme Court recog<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>nized the fair-cross-section guarantee in <em>Taylor v Louisiana.,</em><footnotemark><em>44</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In <em>Taylor, </em>the defendant successfully challenged Louisiana\u2019s jury-selection scheme in which women would not be considered for jury service unless they filed a written declaration of their willingness to serve.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> For the defendant\u2019s jury district, in which 53 percent of the population was female, of the 1,800 individuals drawn to fill venires in a period of nearly a year, only 12 were female.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> The Court held that Louisiana\u2019s practice systematically eliminated women, a \u201cnumerous and distinct\u201d group, from the jury pool, denying the defendant his right to a jury drawn from a fair cross section of the community in violation of the Sixth Amendment.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b712-6\">In <em>Duren, </em>the United States Supreme Court set forth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"597\">*597</page-number>a more substantive framework designed to evaluate fair-cross-section challenges. Specifically, to make a prima facie case of a violation of the Sixth Amendment\u2019s fair-cross-section requirement, a defendant must show:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b713-5\">(1) that the group alleged to be excluded is a \u201cdistinctive\u201d group in the community; (2) that the representation of this group in venires from which juries are selected is not fair and reasonable in relation to the number of such persons in the community; and (3) that this underrepresentation is due to systematic exclusion of the group in the jury-selection process.<footnotemark>[48]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b713-6\">The defendant in <em>Duren </em>successfully argued that the underrepresentation of women in jury venires violated the fair-cross-section requirement. Regarding the first prong, there was no dispute that women were a distinct group in the community.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> The defendant established the second prong \u201cby [his] statistical presentation,\u201d showing that while women were 54 percent of the county\u2019s population, women were only 26.7 percent of the persons summoned for jury service and 14.5 percent of veniremembers during an approximately nine-month period.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> The Court concluded that \u201c[s]uch a gross discrepancy between the percentage of women in jury venires and the percentage of women in the community requires the conclusion that women were not fairly represented in the source from which petit juries were drawn . .. ,\u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b714-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>Regarding the third prong, the Court concluded that the underrepresentation was a result of the systematic exclusion of the group in the jury-selection process. Specifically, the defendant\u2019s statistics, evidence that the selection scheme automatically exempted women from jury service upon their request, and evidence that a large discrepancy had occurred in every weekly venire for almost a year established \u201cthat the cause of the underrepresentation was systematic \u2014 that is, inherent in the particular jury-selection process utilized.\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b714-4\">B. APPLICATION OF THE <em>DUREN </em>TEST</p>\n<p id=\"b714-5\">1. WHETHER A DISTINCT GROUP IS ALLEGED TO HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED</p>\n<p id=\"b714-6\">There is no dispute that African-Americans, the group alleged to be excluded, are a distinct group in the community for the purposes of determining whether there is a violation of the Sixth Amendment\u2019s fair-cross-section requirement.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> Accordingly, defendant satisfied Duren\u2019s first prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">2. WHETHER REPRESENTATION IS FAIR AND REASONABLE</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">The second prong requires defendant to show that \u201crepresentation of this group in venires from which juries are selected is not fair and reasonable in relation to the number of such persons in the community[.]\u201d<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> As we recognized in <em>Smith,</em><footnotemark><em>55</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the United States Supreme Court has not identified a method or test that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>courts must use to measure whether the representation of distinct groups is fair and reasonable.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> In light of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision not to mandate what method or methods should be used, and given the various tests used by lower federal courts, we concluded in <em>Smith </em>that \u201cno individual method should be used exclusive of the others,\u201d adopting \u201ca case-by-case approach.\u201d<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> We further held that \u201c[p]rovided that the parties proffer sufficient evidence, courts should consider the results of all the tests in determining whether representation was fair and reasonable.\u201d<footnotemark>58</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">But in order to properly consider the results of the relevant tests, we must answer the questions we posed in our grant order to identify what data to input into the tests. Specifically, we asked the parties to brief whether in evaluating the second prong, \u201ccourts may choose to examine only the composition of the defendant\u2019s particular jury venire, or whether courts must always examine the composition of broader pools or arrays of prospective jurors\u201d and \u201cwhether a defendant\u2019s claim of such underrepresentation must always be supported by hard data, or whether statistical estimates are permissible . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>59</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">We hold that when applying the relevant statistical tests, a court must examine the composition of jury pools and venires <em>over time </em>using the most reliable data <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>available to determine whether representation is fair and reasonable. Our reading of <em>Duren </em>compels this conclusion. Specifically, <em>Duren </em>sets forth that the second prong is used to evaluate \u201crepresentation of [the distinct] group in <em>venires </em>from which juries are selected ... .\u201d<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> The Court again used the plural \u201cvenires\u201d when it evaluated the defendant\u2019s evidence under the second prong, pointing out the \u201cdiscrepancy between the percentage of women in jury <em>venires </em>and the percentage of women in the community . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> In addition, the Court referred back to the requirement that the second-prong underrepresentation must occur over time when introducing its discussion on the third prong, stating, \u201c[I]t was necessary for petitioner to show that the underrepresentation of women, <em>generally </em>and on his venire, was due to their systematic exclusion in the jury-selection process.\u201d<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> Therefore, when considering whether representation is fair and reasonable, <em>Duren </em>requires a court to evaluate the composition of <em>venires </em>over a significant time period rather than just the defendant\u2019s individual venire.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"601\">*601</page-number>Consequently, the Court of Appeals wrongly considered the results of the tests from a data set that included only defendant\u2019s venire. Relying solely on the composition of defendant\u2019s venire resulted in mislead<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"602\">*602</page-number>ing and exaggerated results.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> The representation of African-Americans in defendant\u2019s venire is only relevant as a part of the larger picture of venires or jury pools. Because underrepresentation in a single venire could result from chance, evaluating whether representation of a distinct group is fair and reasonable requires evaluating venire composition over time. Only then is it possible to see the degree of any underrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-5\">In addition, evaluating the representation of a distinct group in venires over time requires using the most reliable data available to input into the relevant tests. In this case, hard data regarding the race of those sent questionnaires or appearing for jury service are not available for two primary reasons. First, the Secretary of State did not include the racial identity of individuals in the potential-juror database that was provided to Kent County, and thus the court\u2019s computer program did not include a record of the race of the individuals who were selected. Second, the voluntary surveys that the court made available to potential jurors who appeared for jury service, which included a section in which those persons could identify their race, were plagued by wildly inconsistent participation and therefore do not provide a meaningful data set.</p>\n<p id=\"b718-6\">The circuit court did keep records of the zip code of each person sent a jury summons. Reviewing and using those records for the period from January through March 2002, Dr. Stephenson, a statistical expert, was able to estimate, using the racial makeup of each zip code from the census data, the number of African-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"603\">*603</page-number>Americans who had been summoned for jury service from January through March 2002. Given the available zip-code data and the limitations regarding the other potential data sources, it is appropriate to evaluate venire composition using Dr. Stephenson\u2019s statistical estimate.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">Dr. Stephenson estimated that 4.17 percent of the summonses issued were sent to African-Americans from January through March 2002. Given that the census data reflects that the jury-age population of African-Americans in the community is 8.25 percent, it is clear that African-Americans were underrepresented. The pertinent question then is whether this underrepresentation in the composition of jury pools and venires during this time was nonetheless fair and reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">a. ABSOLUTE-DISPARITY TEST</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">The absolute-disparity test is the most widely applied test and is used by the majority of jurisdictions to evaluate whether the representation of a distinct group was fair and reasonable.<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> This test measures a group\u2019s underrepresentation by subtracting the percentile representation of that group in jury pools or venires from the percentile representation of that group in the overall population of the relevant community.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> The absolute-disparity test is useful because it permits a straightforward and undistorted measure of the per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>centage of the group that has been excluded.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> Courts have generally required an absolute disparity of more than 10 percent to indicate that the representation of the distinct group was not fair and reasonable.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">The absolute-disparity test, however, is often criticized because it makes it difficult, if not impossible, for a defendant to make this showing if the distinct group has a small population in the community.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> For example, even if the 8.25 percent African-American population here had been entirely excluded from jury pools and venires for the three-month period analyzed, the absolute disparity would have been only 8.25 percent, falling below the threshold generally applied to determine whether the representation is fair and reasonable.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>Given that the Kent County African-American jury-age population figure is 8.25 percent and the percentage of African-Americans sent jury summonses from January through March 2002 was 4.17 percent, the absolute disparity is 4.08 percent.<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals, however, disregarded the result of this test because the African-American population is small. Although the African-American population in Kent County falls below 10 percent, <em>Smith </em>nonetheless requires \u201cconsideration] [of] the results of all the tests in determining whether representation was fair and reasonable\u201d and instructs that \u201cno individual method should be used exclusive of the others.\u201d<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> Thus, even when the African-American population is small, <em>Smith </em>does not allow a court to simply ignore the absolute-disparity test entirely. Rather, a reviewing court should look at the <em>results </em>of each test and how far each test is below or above the necessary threshold in determining whether, on the whole, the defendant has established that the representation was not fair and reasonable. Consequently, despite the criticism of the absolute-disparity test, the Court of Appeals should not have disregarded the test\u2019s results.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">b. COMPARATIVE-DISPARITY TEST</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">Some courts have used the comparative-disparity test, which measures \u201cthe decreased likelihood that members of an underrepresented group will be called for jury service . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> It is calculated by dividing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>result of the absolute-disparity test by the percentage of the distinct group in the overall population of the community.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> The comparative-disparity test is not widely used and is criticized because it invites distortion of the alleged underrepresentation, particularly when the population of the distinct group is small.<footnotemark>76</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">The Court of Appeals, after disfavoring the result of the absolute-disparity test because the percentage of the distinct group in the relevant community was low, effectively established a bright-line rule favoring the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>comparative-disparity test when the population of the distinct group is small. This holding directly contradicts the case-by-case approach set forth in <em>Smith.</em><footnotemark><em>77</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Again, the comparative-disparity test is particularly defective when the claim involves a small population of a distinct group because it distorts the extent of any underrepresentation. Thus, it does not follow to elevate the comparative-disparity test while disregarding the others tests in precisely the circumstance that the comparative-disparity test is most criticized and apt to produce distorted results.</p>\n<p id=\"b723-5\">The Court of Appeals further erred when it considered the 73.1 percent result of the comparative-disparity test for only defendant\u2019s venire. Using the proper data from Dr. Stephenson\u2019s three-month examination of venires, the comparative disparity was 49.45 percent.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> The United States Courts of Appeals for the First, Third, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits have each found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>permissible comparative disparities above 50 percent.<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> Moreover, the cases cited by the Court of Appeals for the proposition that 30 or 40 percent has been deemed sufficient to demonstrate unfair and unreasonable representation are readily distinguishable.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">In <em>United States v Rogers, </em>a 30.96 percent comparative disparity was deemed significant by an Eighth Circuit panel, but this determination was made in dicta as the panel was bound by earlier Eighth Circuit precedent regarding the particular jury system under review.<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> Accordingly, the panel had to affirm the defendant\u2019s convictions.<footnotemark>81</footnotemark> Thus, given that the Eighth Circuit has not adopted the comparative-disparity test or found it determinative in any case, we do not afford <em>Rogers </em>any weight and view it as an outlier in fair-cross-section jurisprudence. Additionally, in <em>Ramseur v Beyer, </em>which the Court of Appeals also cited, a 40 percent comparative disparity was deemed \u201cborderline.\u201d<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> The minority population in that case was 35.9 percent, and the absolute disparity was 14.1 percent. Thus, the minority population was far larger than in the case at hand. A 40 percent comparative disparity is not a persuasive baseline for this case because the comparative-disparity test distorts the results in cases involving small populations.<footnotemark>83</footnotemark> Given that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>comparative-disparity test distorts the results when the population of the distinct group is small and because the result here falls below the level of disparity that has generally been deemed acceptable by other courts, we conclude that defendant has failed to establish that African-American representation was not fair and reasonable under the comparative-disparity test.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">c. STANDARD-DEVIATION TEST</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">The standard-deviation test, also known as the statistical-significance test, calculates the probability that the observed underrepresentation of the distinct group was the result of chance.<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> The standard-deviation test compares the actual distribution of the distinct group within the data set to the proportional distribution, measuring the \u201cextent to which an observed result is likely to vary from an expected result. The larger the number of standard deviations an observed result is from an expected result, the lower the probability that the observed result is random.\u201d<footnotemark>85</footnotemark> The use of this test has its roots in United States Supreme Court caselaw considering juror representation in the equal-protection context.<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> However, \u201c \u2018no court in the country has accepted [a standard-deviation analysis] alone as determinative in Sixth Amendment challenges to jury selection systems.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>87</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>It is unsurprising that no court has ever accepted the result of this test alone as determinative in this type of challenge because the test in effect has nothing to do with the evaluation of the second prong. That is, whether the degree of underrepresentation is statistically significant and not the result of chance does not inform whether the level of representation is fair and reasonable.<footnotemark>88</footnotemark> Instead, such a result is more appropriately considered in the equal-protection context as an aid in determining whether intentional discrimination exists or perhaps as a part of the evaluation of the third <em>Duren </em>prong.<footnotemark>89</footnotemark> This reality is simply a function of what the test <em>actually measures </em>\u2014 the randomness of a given disparity, not the extent of the disparity.<footnotemark>90</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">Further, Dr. Stephenson concluded that it was inappropriate to apply the standard-deviation test in this case because the normal approximation was not valid. He did, however, apply a related test to determine that the extent of underrepresentation from January through March 2002 was not the result of random chance. Nonetheless, all we garner from the result is just that \u2014 the underrepresentation was not a random occurrence. The mere fact that the underrepresentation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"611\">*611</page-number>was not the result of random chance does not establish that it was not fair and reasonable. Thus, we afford the result of this test no weight.<footnotemark>91</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">d. DISPARITY-OF-RISK TEST</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">Another test that is sometimes discussed is the disparity-of-risk test.<footnotemark>92</footnotemark> This test measures \u201cthe likelihood that the difference between a group\u2019s representation in the jury pool and its population in the community will result in a significant risk that the jury will not fairly represent the group.\u201d<footnotemark>93</footnotemark> It does so by comparing the chance that a defendant\u2019s jury (before or without voir dire)<footnotemark>94</footnotemark> will include members of a distinct group if that group\u2019s representation in the jury pool is consistent with its population in the community with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"612\">*612</page-number>chance that a defendant\u2019s jury will include members of the same group given the particular underrepresentation alleged.<footnotemark>95</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b729-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"613\">*613</page-number>Although this test is not new, the primary reason for its disfavor is because it has yet to garner approval from any court.<footnotemark>96</footnotemark> But given the absence of uniformity for what tests to apply, we will consider it among other measures of underrepresentation. Its purpose \u2014 to estimate the probability of actual underrepresentation on a jury \u2014 is consistent with the United States Supreme Court\u2019s aims to protect <em>a defendant\u2019s right </em>to an impartial jury and a fair trial by means of a jury drawn from a fair cross section of the community.<footnotemark>97</footnotemark> Moreover, considering this test is consistent with <em>Smith\u2019s </em>holding that \u201c[p]rovided that the parties proffer sufficient evidence, courts should consider the results of all the tests in determining whether representation was fair and reasonable.\u201d<footnotemark>98</footnotemark> Thus, it is relevant to consider the extent to which a defendant\u2019s chances of a representative jury were altered by underrepresentation in the jury pool by measuring the diminished likelihood that a randomly drawn 12-person jury includes a given number from a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"614\">*614</page-number>distinct group.<footnotemark>99</footnotemark> In this case, when considering the likelihood that a defendant\u2019s 12-person jury would contain no African-Americans the disparity of risk was 24.39 percent.<footnotemark>100</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">Unlike the absolute-disparity test and the comparative-disparity test, courts have not considered the appropriate threshold under which the disparity of risk should be deemed fair and reasonable. We believe the normative line should be drawn at 50 percent.<footnotemark>101</footnotemark> That is, disparities of risk that exceed 50 percent should be deemed unfair and unreasonable. This is a logical normative line because when measuring a defendant\u2019s probabilistic injuries, a risk disparity of 50 percent or lower shows that, more likely than not, removing the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>underrepresentation would not have altered the composition of a defendant\u2019s jury.<footnotemark>102</footnotemark> Consequently, defendant has failed to show that the representation of African-Americans was not fair and reasonable under the disparity-of-risk test.<footnotemark>103</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">Given the results of the foregoing tests, defendant has failed to show that the representation of African-Americans in the venires at issue was not fair and reasonable. Instead, the results of the absolute-disparity test, comparative-disparity test, and disparity-of-risk test all support the opposite conclusion: that the representation of African-Americans was fair and reasonable. Accordingly, we conclude that defendant did not make out a prima facie case for his Sixth Amendment fair-cross-section claims. Notwithstanding our conclusion on this determinative issue, we will address the third prong in order to consider the argument that a defendant who shows systematic exclusion under the third prong is entitled to make a lesser showing under the second prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">3. WHETHER UNDERREPRESENTATION RESULTS FROM SYSTEMATIC EXCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b731-7\">The third <em>Duren </em>prong requires a defendant to show that \u201cthis underrepresentation is due to systematic exclusion of the group in the jury-selection process.\u201d<footnotemark>104</footnotemark> A systematic exclusion is one that is \u201cinherent in the par<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>ticular jury-selection process utilized.\u201d<footnotemark>105</footnotemark> In <em>Duren, </em>the United States Supreme Court concluded that the practice of excluding women in every weekly venire for nearly a year constituted underrepresentation that was systematic.<footnotemark>106</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">The evidence here shows that a computer programming error in the computer software used to randomly select potential jurors from the Secretary of State database of names of eligible jurors in Kent County truncated that database of names from 453,414 eligible jurors to 118,169. The smaller list of names was used to randomly select potential jurors. This list, however, disproportionately included more individuals in certain zip codes and fewer from other zip codes. The underrepresented zip codes on the whole had higher concentrations of African-Americans. Thus, the computer program error, which was the cause of the systematic exclusion, was one that was \u201cinherent\u201d in the computer program, which was \u201cthe particular jury-selection process utilized\u201d to select potential jurors for service.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">It is irrelevant for the purpose of this analysis that the computer error was not intentional and was corrected upon its discovery because under the third prong \u201csystematic disproportion <em>itself </em>demonstrates an infringement of the defendant\u2019s interest in a jury chosen from a fair community cross section.\u201d<footnotemark>107</footnotemark> Thus, the fact that the computer error was unintentional, and that it was fixed upon its discovery, is immaterial to whether systematic exclusion was occurring at the time defendant\u2019s jury was selected. Accordingly, we conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>defendant satisfied the third prong by showing that the exclusion was systematic.<footnotemark>108</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b733-4\">In <em>Hubbard, </em>a panel of our Court of Appeals addressed a fair-cross-section claim and held that the threshold for underrepresentation is lower when the underrepresentation is \u201cthe result of circumstances less benign than random selection. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>109</footnotemark> In that case, \u201c[t]he evidence produced on remand reveal[ed] that the juror allocation process employed by Kalamazoo County before July 1992 \u2014 and not random selection \u2014 caused the underrepresentation.\u201d<footnotemark>110</footnotemark> The panel concluded that \u201cgiven the lack of benign causation, . . . the level of disparity [absolute disparity of 3.4 percent to 4.1 percent] constituted substantial underrepresentation under the Sixth Amendment.\u201d<footnotemark>111</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b733-5\">In lowering the threshold of the second prong in circumstances in which the level of disparity was the result of nonbenign circumstances, the <em>Hubbard </em>panel erroneously assumed that the underrepresentation contemplated by the second <em>Duren </em>prong depends in part on the reason for the underrepresentation. The reason for the underrepresentation is the basis of the third prong, and the only issue in the second prong is whether the degree of underrepresentation is acceptable. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>other words, <em>Duren </em>requires satisfaction of <em>three </em>distinct prongs. An approach that arbitrarily gives a defendant the benefit of the doubt on the second prong vitiates the three-part analysis. Even if a defendant can show underrepresentation that was systematic, a defendant must show that the extent of any underrepresentation was not fair and reasonable. Moreover, it would be inconsistent to conclude that a certain level of underrepresentation that would otherwise be fair and reasonable absent systematic exclusion is suddenly not fair and reasonable because the cause of the underrepresentation is nonbenign.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">Additionally, <em>Hubbard\u2019s </em>rationale for adopting the approach set forth in <em>United States v </em>Osorio<footnotemark>112</footnotemark> is belied by our case-by-case approach. Specifically, <em>Hubbard </em>articulated concerns about applying the absolute-disparity test in a situation in which the minority population was relatively small. <em>Smith, </em>however, instructs courts not to limit the statistical tests to be considered.<footnotemark>113</footnotemark> Thus, the justification for turning to <em>Osorio </em>is diminished by our case-by-case approach evaluating all the relevant tests. As a result, because the <em>Hubbard </em>approach improperly conflates the second and third prongs as set forth in <em>Duren </em>and because its rationale is unnecessary in light of our case-by-case approach, we reject it and overrule <em>Hubbard </em>to the extent that it is inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-5\">IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b734-6\">This case presented the issue whether defendant was denied his Sixth Amendment right to an impartial jury <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>drawn from a fair cross section of the community. Because we conclude that defendant did not establish that the representation of African-Americans was not fair and reasonable under the second prong of the <em>Duren </em>test, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and reinstate defendant\u2019s convictions and sentences.</p>\n<judges id=\"b735-4\">Young, C.J., and Markman and Mary Beth Kelly, JJ., concurred with ZAHRA, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b697-12\"> <em>Duren v Missouri, </em>439 US 357; 99 S Ct 664; 58 L Ed 2d 579 (1979).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[2]\">\n<p id=\"b698-8\">2 <em>Id. </em>at 364.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b698-9\"> <em>People v Smith, </em>463 Mich 199; 615 NW2d 1 (2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b699-6\"> The terms \u201cvenire,\u201d \u201cjury pool,\u201d \u201cjury panel,\u201d and \u201carray\u201d are sometimes used interchangeably.

As an alternative rationale, the trial court concluded that even if <em>Smith </em>did permit statistical estimates, these estimates had a marginal value because of the many variables involved in their accuracy and defendant could not prove his claim because no hard data included what percentage of African-Americans were sent jury questionnaires. As an additional alternative rationale, the trial court concluded that even if statistical estimates could satisfy the second prong, defendant failed to show that the representation was not fair and reasonable because he was not actually the victim of underrepresentation in his particular venire.

In addition, an abundance of caselaw supports that when applying <em>Duren\u2019% </em>second prong, courts look to the degree of underrepresentation over time. See, e.g., <em>United States </em>v <em>Orange, </em>447 F3d 792, 798 (CA 10, 2006); <em>Weaver, </em>267 F3d at 238, 243; <em>United States v Royal, </em>174 F3d 1, 5, 10-11 (CA 1, 1999); <em>Thomas v Borg, </em>159 F3d 1147, 1150 (CA 9, 1998); <em>United States v Rioux, </em>97 F3d 648, 657-658 (CA 2, 1996); <em>Francis v Fabian, </em>669 F Supp 2d 970, 984 (D Minn, 2009); <em>People v Washington, </em>179 P3d 153, 162-164 (Colo, 2007); <em>People v Bell, </em>49 Cal 3d 502, 526-527; 262 Cal Rptr 1; 778 P2d 129 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-7\">Despite our straightforward reading of <em>Duren </em>and this supporting authority in her dissent Justice Marilyn Kelly disagrees that the second prong requires a pattern of underrepresentation over time. She does so while choosing not to address the language in <em>Duren </em>that compels this treatment of the second prong. She also attempts to critique some of our supporting caselaw by ignoring that those same cases explicitly support our reading of Duren\u2019s second prong. Moreover, some of the cases she cites do not even contain a substantive discussion of the second prong, while no case that she cites actually concludes that the second prong may be satisfied by a showing of underrepresentation in only a particular defendant\u2019s venire.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-8\">In addition, contrary to Justice Kelly\u2019s suggestion, our approach does not ignore defendant\u2019s venire under the second prong. Instead, we merely follow <em>Duren </em>by including it in the data set of venires used to calculate the degree of underrepresentation. See <em>Duren, </em>439 US at 362-366 (considering under the second prong a data set that included January through March 1976, when the defendant\u2019s trial began in March 1976). Of course, as in <em>Duren, </em>439 US at 363, the distinct group was underrepresented in defendant\u2019s individual venire, giving rise to this claim in the first place. But <em>Duren </em>reflects that such underrepresentation does not amount to a constitutional fair-cross-section violation without a showing that includes the degree of underrepresentation over time under the second prong. Thus, defendant\u2019s venire is simply part of the larger statistical presentation in this analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"64\">\n<p id=\"b718-7\"> When only a particular defendant\u2019s venire is examined, the results may look more or less significant depending on the actual composition of the individual venire compared to the broader picture.

If, on the other hand, the overall population is 50% African American and venires are 0% African American, then the odds of having an African American petit juror would drop from near-certainty to total impossibility. The fact that the absolute disparity test cannot distinguish between these radically different scenarios indicates that it does not measure defendants\u2019 probabilistic injuries.

Another commentator described the problem with the comparative-disparity test as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b722-9\">Yet the comparative disparity test lacks the absolute disparity test\u2019s awareness of what fraction of the total [population] has been tampered with. For example, when all African Americans are absent from venires, the result is the highest possible comparative disparity score, 100%. But that figure is useless unless one also accounts for how many African Americans are in the overall population. If the total population is majority African American, then the observed underrepresentation would reduce the odds of drawing an African American juryperson from near certainty to total impossibility. If, on the other hand, African Americans comprise just 0.1% of the total population, then the likelihood of drawing an African American would not have significantly declined. Thus, despite its support among prominent commentators, the comparative disparity test, like the absolute disparity test, simply does not measure the probabilistic injuries generated by fair cross-section violations. <em>[Jury poker, </em>8 Ohio St J Crim L at 545-546.]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"77\">\n<p id=\"b723-6\"> <em>Smith, </em>463 Mich at 204.

I write separately only because I have questions concerning both Duren\u2019s test and the constitutional standard toward which this test is directed.</p>\n<p id=\"b735-6\">The Sixth Amendment guarantees criminal defendants the right to a trial \u201cby an impartial jury . ...\u201d In <em>Taylor v Louisiana, </em>419 US 522, 526; 95 S Ct 692; 42 L Ed 2d 690 (1975), the Supreme Court determined that \u201cthe presence of a fair cross section of the community on venires, panels, or lists from which petit juries are drawn is essential to the fulfillment\u201d of this constitutional guarantee. The \u201cfair cross section\u201d requirement is satisfied as long as \u201cdistinctive\u201d groups are reasonably represented on the jury venire; however, it does not entitle a defendant to a jury whose composition is proportional to that group\u2019s presence within the community from which the venire is chosen. As <em>Taylor </em>emphasized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b735-7\">Defendants are not entitled to a jury of any particular composition, but the jury wheels, pools of names, panels, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>venires from which juries are drawn must not systematically exclude distinctive groups in the community and thereby fail to be reasonably representative thereof. <em>[Id. </em>at 538 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b736-4\">Under the \u201cfair cross section\u201d analysis, it is unnecessary for a defendant to show that the lack of \u201creasonable representation\u201d of a \u201cdistinctive\u201d group is the result of discrimination in the jury-selection system, as would be required under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. See, e.g., <em>Castaneda v Partida, </em>430 US 482, 494; 97 S Ct 1272; 51 L Ed 2d 498 (1977). Rather, in \u201cfair-cross-section cases, systematic disproportion <em>itself </em>demonstrates an infringement of the defendant\u2019s interest in a jury chosen from a fair community cross section.\u201d <em>Duren, </em>439 US at 368 n 26 (emphasis added). So the critical constitutional inquiry appears to be directed toward the extent or magnitude of the \u201csystematic disproportion.\u201d While \u201cproportional\u201d representation of \u201cdistinctive\u201d groups is not required, what constitutes \u201cproportional\u201d representation must nonetheless be constantly borne in mind so that the level of \u201cdisproportion\u201d can be calculated because, at some uncertain point, a level of \u201cdisproportion\u201d that is apparently constitutionally <em>acceptable </em>is transformed into a level of \u201cdisproportion\u201d that <em>breaches </em>the Sixth Amendment. And it is the responsibility of this Court to determine on a \u201ccase by case\u201d basis when that point of transformation occurs, principally through the application of myriad statistical tests, some of which have been given the explicit imprimatur of the United States Supreme Court and others of which have not, but at the same time have not been repudiated, in light of the apparent nonexclusivity of the approved tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b736-5\">In <em>Duren, </em>the Supreme Court set forth a three-part test to evaluate \u201cfair cross section\u201d challenges. Specifically, in order to establish a prima facie case, a defendant must show</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number>(1) that the group alleged to be excluded is a \u201cdistinctive\u201d group in the community; (2) that the representation of this group in venires from which juries are selected is not fair and reasonable in relation to the number of such persons in the community; and (3) that this underrepresentation is due to systematic exclusion of the group in the jury-selection process. <em>[Id. </em>at 364.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-4\">The dispositive question in this case concerns the second part of Duren\u2019s test \u2014 i.e., whether the representation of African-Americans in venires from which juries were selected in Kent County during the period in which defendant was tried and convicted is \u201cfair and reasonable in relation to the number of such persons in the community.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b737-5\">To determine whether representation is \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d under the <em>Duren </em>test, courts have applied yet <em>more </em>tests. In <em>People v Smith, </em>463 Mich 199; 615 NW2d 1 (2000), this Court discussed three statistical tests that have been used to measure whether representation of a \u201cdistinctive\u201d group in the jury pool is \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d: the \u201cabsolute disparity\u201d test, the \u201ccomparative disparity\u201d test, and the \u201cstandard deviation\u201d test. Recognizing that all three tests are imperfect and susceptible to criticisms, <em>Smith </em>held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b737-6\">We thus consider all these approaches to measuring whether representation was fair and reasonable, and conclude that no individual method should be used exclusive of the others. Accordingly, we adopt a case-by-case approach. Provided that the parties proffer sufficient evidence, courts should consider the results of all the tests in determining whether representation was fair and reasonable. <em>[Id. </em>at 204.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b737-7\">After a decision on habeas corpus review by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit asserting that <em>Smith </em>constituted an \u201cunreasonable\u201d application of \u201cclearly established federal law,\u201d <em>Smith v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number><em>Berghuis, </em>543 F3d 326, 329, 334 (CA 6, 2008), the United States Supreme Court unanimously reversed the Sixth Circuit, holding that \u201cneither <em>Duren </em>nor any other decision of this Court specifies the method or test courts must use to measure the representation of distinctive groups injury pools.\u201d <em>Berghuis v Smith, </em>559 US 314, 329; 130 S Ct 1382, 1393; 176 L Ed 2d 249 (2010). Noting that \u201c[e]ach test is imperfect,\u201d the Supreme Court declined \u201cto take sides today on the method or methods by which underrepresentation is appropriately measured.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 329-330.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-4\">Given this state of the law, I join the majority opinion because it engages in a reasoned application of the relevant decisions of the United States Supreme Court and this Court. Consistently with the approach outlined in our decision in <em>Smith, </em>the majority opinion considers the results of all three tests for which the parties have proffered evidence in determining whether the representation of African-Americans, the \u201cdistinctive\u201d group in question, was \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d in Kent County venires. Specifically, the majority opinion considers the results of the \u201cabsolute disparity\u201d and the \u201ccomparative disparity\u201d tests, as well as those of an additional test, the \u201cdisparity of risk\u201d test,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and concludes that the results are insufficient to warrant a finding that African-American representation in the venires during the relevant period was not \u201cfair and reasonable.\u201d Thus, defendant has failed to establish a prima facie violation of the Sixth Amendment\u2019s \u201cfair cross section\u201d requirement. Although the Court of Appeals\u2019 opinion and the dissenting opinions of this Court also, in my <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>judgment, reflect reasonable efforts to apply <em>Duren, </em>their use of only the results from the \u201ccomparative disparity\u201d test to ascertain a \u201cfair cross section\u201d violation, their decisions not to use data from multiple venires over time, and their decisions not to fully consider the results of the \u201cabsolute disparity\u201d test cause me to prefer the majority\u2019s analysis. See <em>Smith, </em>463 Mich at 204 (\u201c[N]o individual method should be used exclusive of the others.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-4\">That said, the fact that both sides have sought reasonably and in good faith to apply <em>Duren </em>underscores questions concerning Duren\u2019s test itself. These largely arise from the sense that in applying <em>Duren, </em>this Court seems to me engaged more in the judicial equivalent of a Rorschach test, an essentially standardless inquiry in which judicial conclusions are indicative more of personal judgments concerning the \u201cfairness and reasonableness\u201d of the Kent County venire than in the application of any discernible constitutional command.</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">In particular, I am concerned about the statistical tests used to determine whether Duren\u2019s second part has been satisfied. The limitations of these tests have been widely noted, see, e.g., <em>Berghuis, </em>559 US at 329; <em>ante </em>at 603-611; <em>post </em>at 637-638, and need not be revisited here. It suffices to say that when, as here, members of the \u201cdistinctive\u201d group comprise only a relatively small percentage of the community\u2019s jury-eligible population, one test arguably makes it difficult for a defendant to ever satisfy the requisite showing of \u201cunderrepresentation,\u201d another arguably exaggerates this \u201cunderrepresentation,\u201d and the third appears to be generally disfavored because it does not constitute an appropriate measure of anything obviously relevant to a determination whether the level of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>representation on the venires was \u201cfair and reasonable.\u201d In light of these deficiencies, how do the results of these tests, either considered individually or collectively, usefully illuminate whether representation was \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d? How do the bench and bar draw a meaningful legal conclusion from the application of these tests to the available statistical data? How rational, and how flexible, are the statistical thresholds that have been established by some courts in distinguishing between \u201cunderrepresentations\u201d that are compatible with a \u201cfair cross section,\u201d and those that are not? To what extent, if any, may these thresholds be raised or lowered, as a function of the nature or the degree of any \u201csystematic exclusion\u201d under the third part of <em>Duren, </em>or must these parts be analyzed entirely discretely? To what extent, if any, should these thresholds be raised or lowered by Fourteenth Amendment considerations of discriminatory purpose or intention, or are those considerations simply irrelevant to the \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d analysis under the Sixth Amendment? To what extent are these thresholds emblematic of what the dissent in <em>Duren </em>predicted would become a mere \u201cconstitutional numbers game,\u201d <em>Duren, </em>439 US at 375 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting), or do these effectively communicate some independent reality as to what is required by the Constitution? Existing statistical tests and thresholds certainly provide one means by which to address Duren\u2019s second part, but is it now the law of the land that the fate of criminal defendants, such as Ramon Bryant, as well as the effectiveness of the criminal justice system in communities, such as Kent County, in maintaining the security of their citizens are to be determined as a function of whether the data emerging from a host of statistical tests are to be \u201crounded up\u201d or \u201crounded down,\u201d the number of decimal points considered, and whether the denominator <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>reflecting the presence of the \u201cdistinctive\u201d group within the community has been determined by the most recent census figures, by mid-census estimates, or by the latest moving-van rental figures? In summary, which specific statistical tests best communicate whether jury representation of \u201cdistinctive\u201d groups is constitutionally \u201cfair and reasonable,\u201d and under what circumstances, and by the application of which thresholds of deviation from the \u201cproportional\u201d representation standard? If the fate of individual defendants, and the ability of individual communities to carry out the enormous responsibility of protecting their citizens from criminal predators, is to be dependent on statistical testing, then there should be no uncertainty regarding either the relevance of a particular test in a particular circumstance or the standards for assessing, and thereby according legal and constitutional significance to, the results of those tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-4\">However, perhaps an even more fundamental question is also raised here \u2014 why certain statistical tests and not others? The United States Supreme Court has acknowledged that the three tests described in <em>Smith </em>are each imperfect, <em>Berghuis, </em>559 US at 329, and has declined \u201cto take sides today on the method or methods by which underrepresentation is appropriately measured,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 329-330. Doubtless, there is no end to statistical tests by which a court might seek to compare various-sized populations of \u201cdistinctive\u201d groups within a community and their representation on venires. Equally doubtless, as evidenced in this very case, tests can be devised that will tend both toward sustaining and repudiating a finding of \u201cunderrepresentation.\u201d Is the new \u201cdisparity of risk\u201d test a genuinely valid means of adducing the existence of a Sixth Amendment violation, or are the dissenting justices correct that it \u201cneither improves nor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>clarifies this area of the law\u201d? <em>Post </em>at 633. What are the <em>standards </em>by which this Court can discern which tests are relevant in identifying Sixth Amendment violations? And what is the relevance of the fact that some tests might point in one direction regarding the second <em>Duren </em>part, and others might point in the opposite direction? Does this suggest that these tests are asking and answering different questions, or that one test is asking and answering the wrong question? How do judges <em>test </em>the tests to ensure that the right question is being asked? Wdien tests differ in their results, how are these results to be reconciled in answering the ultimate constitutional question? May the court compare and contrast the degree or extent to which different tests deviate from thresholds distinguishing acceptable and unacceptable levels of statistical disparity? Is the court simply free to choose at its discretion among such conflicting tests? If there is some actual decision-making <em>standard </em>in selecting among conflicting tests, what is it? If such a standard has anything to do with determining which test better identifies \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d representation of \u201cdistinctive\u201d groups in venires, then is this not a Catch-22 tautology, to wit, in choosing among tests that best identify the absence of \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d representation, a court must employ the test that best identifies \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d representation? What if multiple tests are applied, as in the instant case, and these produce split results of 2-1 or 3-1 or 7-6 in favor of the plaintiff or the defendant? Is there some \u201cmajority rule\u201d that requires that we resolve conflicts in favor of the outcome of the majority of statistical tests applied? If so, does this not render all-important the court\u2019s initial determination of which tests are going to be considered, and how that is to be determined? And if the \u201cmajority rule\u201d does not apply, how do courts <em>distinguish </em>among conflicting tests <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>in determining which of these will be dispositive in concluding that the Sixth Amendment has or has not been breached?<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b743-4\">These and related questions concern the meaning of <em>Smith\u2019s </em>directive that courts must <em>\u201cconsider </em>all. . . approaches to measuring whether representation was fair and reasonable . . . <em>Smith, </em>463 Mich at 204 (emphasis added). Indeed, very different conceptions of this obligation are reflected in the majority and dissenting opinions. Justice MARILYN KELLY argues that the Court of Appeals below \u201cproperly considered the results of all tests [including the absolute-disparity test], but decided that the comparative disparity test was \u2018the most appropriate test to measure underrepresentation in this case,\u2019 \u201d <em>post </em>at 638, quoting <em>People v Bryant, </em>289 Mich App 260, 271; 796 NW2d 135 (2010), while the majority concludes that <em>Smith </em>requires more than simply alluding to a test and then failing to \u201cconsider\u201d it. One might think that such a difference of opinion could be easily resolved if there were some clear sense regarding <em>why </em>a particular test is or is not \u201cappropriate\u201d in furthering our understanding of whether \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d representation has been achieved, which, of course, would require a clear understanding of what is meant by \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d representation, which in turn would require a clear understanding of whether the constitutional task at hand is simply to calculate the divergence of actual representation on the venire from the \u201cideal\u201d of proportional representation (an ideal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>certainly implied by the <em>Duren </em>concept of \u201cunderrepresentation\u201d)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and then apply some statistical equivalent of the \u201cI know it when I see it\u201d test once articulated by former United States Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart in the realm of obscenity law. <em>Jacobellis v Ohio, </em>378 US 184, 197; 84 S Ct 1676; 12 L Ed 2d 793 (1964) (Stewart, J., concurring).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">That is, even if I could clearly answer each of the aforementioned questions, and knew which tests to \u201cconsider\u201d and how to give legal import to their results, it still would be difficult to apply <em>Duren </em>because the ultimate constitutional standard to which it is directed remains unclear. I know what the constitutional standard in \u201cfair cross section\u201d cases is <em>not. </em>It is not an equal-protection standard under which any \u201cunderrep<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"629\">*629</page-number>resentation\u201d resulting from intentional or purposeful discrimination in the jury venire is prohibited by the Constitution. See <em>Taylor, </em>419 US at 526-528; <em>Duren, </em>439 US at 368 n 26. And it is not a \u201cproportional\u201d representation standard under which <em>any </em>systematic exclusion that results in the \u201cunderrepresentation\u201d of a \u201cdistinctive\u201d group is prohibited by the Constitution, <em>Taylor, </em>419 US at 538; <em>Duren, </em>439 US at 364 \u2014 although references by the Supreme Court to \u201cunderrepresentation,\u201d \u201cdisproportion,\u201d and \u201crepresentative[ness]\u201d would certainly cause some judges to look in precisely that direction, absent the Court\u2019s admonition to the contrary. Thus, the \u201cfair cross section\u201d requirement, which purports to eschew both principles of nondiscrimination and proportional representation, must be premised on some alternative standard drawn from the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee of an \u201cimpartial jury.\u201d See <em>Taylor, </em>419 US at 526. But see <em>Berghuis, </em>559 US at 334; 130 S Ct at 1396 (Thomas, J., concurring) (arguing that the fair-cross-section requirement \u201crests less on the Sixth Amendment than on an \u2018amalgamation of the Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019 \u201d) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b745-4\">Thus, some amount of \u201cunderrepresentation\u201d is \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d and some amount is not, and the courts are to choose where the line is to be drawn. The problem is not that judges are ill equipped to determine what is \u201cfair and reasonable,\u201d as such inquiries are made daily by judges in other constitutional contexts. In the context of the <em>Duren </em>test, however, there is no agreed-upon standard or \u201cideal\u201d by which to measure the constitutional mandate of an \u201cimpartial jury\u201d at the venire stage. The United States Supreme Court has stated that proportionality constitutes one relevant measure, but that it is also not required in order to satisfy the Constitution, which leads to uncertainty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"630\">*630</page-number>because there is also no agreed-upon standard by which to measure how close a venire must come to proportionality, or indeed even how one measures proportionality. What \u201csystemic,\u201d but nondiscriminatory, deviations are acceptable under the Constitution, and what \u201csystemic,\u201d but nondiscriminatory, deviations are not? Given this lack of clear external standards and the wealth of divergent statistical measurements available, how can a judge ensure that his or her own private sensibilities concerning what is \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d in the make-up of the venire do not come to prevail over what is required by the Constitution and that statistical tests do not come to be selected, and standards for evaluating their results not come to be adopted, that merely tend to match those sensibilities? Focusing exclusively on the merits of the various tests obscures the forest for the trees, for without some clear sense of what the constitutional guarantee of an \u201cimpartial jury\u201d requires at the venire stage, it will prove difficult, if not impossible, to achieve uniformity in the analyses of the composition of different venires. This, in turn, incurs the risk of making judicial determinations regarding \u201cimpartial juries\u201d fraught with partiality and mathematical gamesmanship, while lending credence to Justice Rehnquist\u2019s concerns about a \u201cconstitutional numbers game.\u201d <em>Duren, </em>439 US at 375 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">In the end, many trial and appellate judges have reviewed this case, and the question whether the venire here was \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d has closely divided them in favor of a negative response. While I have no doubt that each of these judges has addressed the question in this case \u201cfairly and reasonably,\u201d and in accordance with his or her own best understanding of <em>Duren, </em>there seems to be little in the way of a coherent constitutional standard that distinguishes between \u201csystematic exclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"631\">*631</page-number>sions\u201d that violate the Constitution and \u201csystematic exclusions\u201d that do not, much less a clear statistical method for giving effect to this constitutional standard. And as a result, I believe that our decision-making in this realm resembles uncomfortably a judicial Rorschach test, in which the judge is ultimately required to look <em>inward </em>in determining what is \u201cfair and reasonable,\u201d rather than <em>outward </em>to a comprehensible constitutional rule of law. In joining the majority opinion, and despite what I believe to be confusion concerning aspects of the <em>Duren </em>test, I have sought to the best of my understanding of what is required by the United States Supreme Court to give reasonable meaning to this test and to the guarantees of the Constitution.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b738-5\"> The majority opinion does not analyze the results of the \u201cstandard deviation\u201d test because the only expert whom the trial court found credible, Dr. Paul Stephenson, testified that the test was \u201cnot appropriate\u201d in the present circumstances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b743-5\"> While these questions may seem a mere quibble to some, when judges are free to pick and choose among disparate tests, pointing to disparate constitutional conclusions, defendants and communities that are not significantly disparate may end up being treated in a disparate manner as a function of the judicial decision-making involved in: (a) choosing appropriate tests; (b) evaluating or considering such tests; and (c) reconciling such tests when they produce conflicting results.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b744-5\"> See also <em>Duren, </em>439 US at 372 n * (Rehnquist, J., dissenting) (observing that if the fair-cross-section requirement \u201cwere truly an essential element of the due process right to trial by an impartial jury, a defendant would be entitled to a jury composed of [distinctive groups] in perfect proportion to their numbers in the community\u201d). For a similar perspective, see Leipold, <em>Constitutionalizing jury selection in criminal cases: A critical evaluation, </em>86 Geo L J 945, 965 (1998):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b744-6\">A defendant is thus placed in a strange position: he is entitled to a jury drawn from a fair cross section specifically because it increases the odds that different groups and perspectives will be represented in the jury pool, which in turn helps ensure that the panel is impartial; when actually seating a jury, however, he may not take those same characteristics into account. He may not base his peremptory strikes on the very same proxy for viewpoints that the Court has already used to justify the cross-section requirement, even if his efforts are designed to bring about the exact benefit that the cross-section requirement provides. An attempt to support the cross-section requirement on impartiality grounds thus runs headlong into the rule that race or gender may not be used as a substitute for inclinations, biases, or possible votes.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b744-7\"> As did Justice Stewart, I also recognize that both this Court and the United States Supreme Court are quite possibly faced here with \u201cthe task of trying to define what may be indefinable.\u201d <em>Jacobellis, </em>378 US at 197 (Stewart, J., concurring).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b747-4\">CAVANAGH, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Asg\">(dissenting).

Specifically, \u201c[w]hen the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"632\">*632</page-number>showing of underrepresentation is close, or none of the methods of analysis are particularly well-suited to a case,\u201d I believe courts should \u201cglance ahead\u201d to Duren\u2019s third prong and consider a defendant\u2019s evidence of systematic exclusion. <em>Smith, </em>463 Mich at 222. Under this approach, if the jury-selection process appears likely to systematically exclude a distinctive group, that is, the jury-selection process bears the mark of a non-benign influence, a court may give a defendant the benefit of the doubt on underrepresentation. <em>Id. </em>at 218, 222-224. Applying this approach to the facts <em>of </em>this case, I agree with Justice KELLY\u2019S conclusion that the Court of Appeals did not clearly err by holding that defendant is entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">The majority\u2019s decision to hastily adopt the \u201cdisparity of risk\u201d test has also given me pause, when, as Justice KELLY aptly observes, the test was not addressed by the lower courts, was not briefed or argued to this Court, and, as the majority concedes, has not been endorsed by <em>any </em>court in the country. Thus, because the substantive merits of the disparity-of-risk test and the majority\u2019s 50 percent threshold<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> were not presented to this Court, I decline to pass judgment on the merits of the test at this time without the benefit of full briefing and oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b748-7\"> Indeed, aside from the fact that the issue was not raised or argued by the parties in this case, given the majority\u2019s conclusion that defendant\u2019s risk disparity falls below even the threshold proposed by the author first introducing the disparity of risk test, see <em>ante </em>at 615 n 102, I question whether it is necessary to adopt a higher threshold in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-4\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b748-6\">Marilyn Kelly, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Avx\">(dissenting).

The majority opinion imputes error where there is none. Worse, it sua sponte introduces a \u201cdisparity of risk\u201d test not accepted by any court in the country. The analysis the majority has set forth today neither improves nor clarifies this area of the law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">The majority concludes that the Court of Appeals erred in two ways when evaluating the second prong of <em>Duren. </em>First, it considered the representation of African-Americans only in defendant\u2019s venire, not in multiple venires over time. Second, it misapplied our decision in <em>People v </em>Smith<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> by \u201ceffectively adopting] a bright-line rule in favor of the comparative-disparity test in all instances in which the population of the distinct group is small.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> With regard to the first contention, the majority does not make a persuasive case that the Court of Appeals erred. And the second allegation of error is based on an inaccurate statement of what the Court of Appeals did.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">I generally agree with the majority that, under <em>Duren, </em>courts must consider the composition of venires <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"634\">*634</page-number>over time. The Court of Appeals considered the specific disparity in the composition of defendant\u2019s venire when evaluating the second <em>Duren </em>prong. And it considered multiple venires over time when applying the third <em>Duren </em>prong.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> I am not persuaded that this was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-4\">Some of the authority the majority relies on undermines its conclusion. For example, if a distinctive group is not underrepresented in a defendant\u2019s particular venire, there is no cognizable Sixth Amendment claim. Thus, a distinctive group\u2019s underrepresentation in a defendant\u2019s particular venire is a necessary component of a Sixth Amendment claim. Accordingly, the composition of a defendant\u2019s particular venire must be examined at some point in the <em>Duren </em>analysis. Yet the majority\u2019s approach effectively ignores it.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b750-5\">Other cases that the majority cites do not conclusively demonstrate that the composition of multiple venires over time must be considered under the second <em>Duren </em>prong rather than the third. To the contrary, these cases seem to stand for the uncontroversial proposition that a defendant must show underrepresentation in multiple venires over time to satisfy the <em>Duren </em>test generally.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Indeed, one of the majority\u2019s quotations from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"635\">*635</page-number><em>Duren </em>supports this analysis.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Moreover, cases not cited by the majority contradict its conclusion and suggest that multiple venires over time are relevant to the question of systematic exclusion rather than the question of underrepresentation.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"636\">*636</page-number>Consequently, I do not agree with the majority that <em>Duren </em>stands for the proposition that \u201cevaluating whether representation of a distinct group is fair and reasonable requires evaluating venire composition over time.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Rather, I believe that evaluating whether <em>systematic exclusion </em>occurred requires looking for a pattern of underrepresentation over time. This makes sense because to show a constitutional flaw in a jury-selection system, a defendant must show that the system <em>consistently </em>leads to unrepresentative venires. Indeed, in general it is the consistency of the system\u2019s failure to produce representative venires that proves systematic exclusion. <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b752-4\">Thus, the Court of Appeals did not err by using the comparative disparity in defendant\u2019s venire \u2014 73.1 percent \u2014 when applying the second prong of <em>Duren</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark><em> </em>And it appropriately evaluated the disparity in the racial composition of venires over time when applying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"637\">*637</page-number>the third <em>Duren </em>prong. The majority\u2019s first assignment of error is therefore without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-4\">The majority\u2019s second criticism of the Court of Appeals\u2019 opinion is that it supposedly established \u201ca bright-line rule favoring the comparative-disparity test\u201d and disregarded the results of the other tests.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Respectfully, I believe that the majority misreads or mischaracterizes the Court of Appeals\u2019 opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b753-5\">The Court of Appeals did consider the results of both the absolute-disparity test and the standard-deviation test, but found both unhelpful to resolving defendant\u2019s appeal.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The majority determines that this was error, but offers little explanation why this is so. It repeats that <em>Smith </em>mandated that courts consider the results of all the tests when determining whether the second prong of <em>Duren </em>is met. But the Court of Appeals specifically recognized that <em>Smith </em>requires such an approach and did analyze the results of each test. It simply found the results of one test \u2014 the comparative-disparity test \u2014 most helpful. It does not follow that because the Court of Appeals ultimately settled on one test as most meaningful, it relied on that test without considering the others. Nothing supports the majority\u2019s sweeping assertion that the Court of Appeals established a bright-line rule in favor of the comparative-disparity test.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>Moreover, in what respect does the majority think that the Court of Appeals should have further \u201cregarded\u201d the results of the absolute-disparity test? The panel correctly recognized that if the absolute-disparity test controlled, a successful Sixth Amendment fair-cross-section challenge would be impossible in cases like this one in which the minority population is small. Even the expert who testified at the evidentiary hearing concluded that an analysis of absolute disparity is not a viable method of measuring underrepresentation in this case. Thus, I cannot see what further insight the majority believes that the Court of Appeals should have divined from the results of the absolute-disparity test.</p>\n<p id=\"b754-4\">When discussing the results of the standard-deviation test, the majority makes precisely the same error that it accuses the Court of Appeals of making. It notes the flaws in the standard-deviation test and decides to \u201cafford the result of this test no weight.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> It does so notwithstanding <em>Smith\u2019s </em>mandate that courts consider the results of all three tests. This inconsistency highlights why the majority\u2019s criticism of the Court of Appeals in this respect is misplaced. <em>Smith </em>may mandate consideration of the results of all tests, but it does not dictate that a court give no more weight to one test than another. The Court of Appeals properly considered the results of all tests, but decided that the comparative-disparity test was \u201cthe most appropriate test to measure underrepresentation in this case.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b754-5\">Finally, I cannot agree with the majority\u2019s importation of a fourth test \u2014 its disparity-of-risk test \u2014 into this appeal. First, no party or amicus curiae mentioned the disparity-of-risk test, let alone requested that we adopt it. Thus, the test was not properly considered by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>parties or the courts below.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Second, as the majority notes, its test has yet to garner approval from a single court as a viable means to test Sixth Amendment fair-cross-section claims. Despite these shortcomings, the majority sua sponte adopts it, applies it to this case, and declares that a violation occurs under that test when the disparity of risk exceeds 50 percent. The majority\u2019s decision to do so absent any advocacy, let alone vigorous advocacy, on the issue is highly questionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-4\">I believe that my analysis dispels the majority\u2019s findings of error by the Court of Appeals and demonstrates that the Court of Appeals correctly analyzed this case. The majority\u2019s sole remaining basis for reversing the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment is its disagreement with that court\u2019s reliance on <em>People v Hubbard (After Re</em>mand.j.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> I disagree that <em>Hubbard </em>should be partially overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b755-5\">Under <em>Hubbard, </em>a court may consider the reason for a systematic exclusion when deciding whether representation of the distinctive group was fair and reasonable. If a jury-selection process systematically excludes a distinctive group on the basis of nonbenign factors, a court may give a defendant the benefit of the doubt on underrepresentation.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> <em>Hubbard </em>borrowed this approach from <em>United States v </em>Biaggi<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> and <em>United States v Osorio.</em><footnotemark><em>21</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Although <em>Biaggi </em>and <em>Osorio </em>are not binding on this Court, they are persuasive. Moreover, contrary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"640\">*640</page-number>to the majority\u2019s conclusion that this approach \u201cvitiates the three-part analysis,\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> other courts have endorsed an analysis that merges the second and third <em>Duren </em>prongs in this fashion.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b756-4\">Accordingly, I would follow <em>Hubbard, </em>as Justice CAVANAGH advocated in his concurring opinion in Smith.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Thus, I give defendant \u201cthe benefit of the doubt on underrepresentation\u201d and \u201cglance ahead\u201d to the third <em>Duren </em>prong.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Unlike the defendant in <em>Smith, </em>defendant here has established that systematic exclusion occurred because the computer error that caused the exclusion was \u201cinherent\u201d in the jury-selection process used. As in <em>Hubbard, </em>the exclusion \u201cdid not result from \u2018benign\u2019 random selection, but, instead, resulted from a defect inherent in the juror allocation process . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b756-5\">Because defendant established that systematic exclusion occurred and \u201cthe showing of underrepresentation is close,\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark>1 conclude that defendant has established a prima facie violation of the Sixth Amendment\u2019s fair-cross-section requirement. The prosecution identifies no significant state interest that was advanced by the selection process that systematically excluded African-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"641\">*641</page-number>Americans from Kent County venires.
