In particular, we must decide several issues relating to ICWA\u2019s notice provision, 25 USC 1912(a), which mandates that notice of certain involuntary child custody proceedings be sent to the appropriate Indian tribe or to the Secretary of the Interior \u201cwhere the court knows or has reason to know that an Indian child is involved. . ..\u201d Because the question whether notice violations occurred in the instant cases begins with determining whether the tribal-notice requirement of 25 USC 1912(a) was triggered, we must first consider the indicia of Indian heritage that will suffice to trigger the notice requirement. We must also consider whether a parent can waive the rights granted by ICWA to an Indian child\u2019s tribe and determine the appropriate recordkeeping requirements necessary to document the trial court\u2019s efforts to comply with ICWA\u2019s notice provision. Finally, we must determine the proper appellate remedy for violations of ICWA\u2019s notice provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">While it is impossible to articulate a precise rule that will encompass every possible factual situation, in light of the interests protected by ICWA, the potentially high costs of erroneously concluding that notice need not be sent, and the relatively low burden of erring in favor of requiring notice, we think the standard for triggering the notice requirement of 25 USC 1912(a) must be a cautionary one. Therefore, we hold first that sufficiently reliable information of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>virtually any criteria on which tribal membership might be based suffices to trigger the notice requirement. We hold also that a parent of an Indian child cannot waive the separate and independent ICWA rights of an Indian child\u2019s tribe and that the trial court must maintain a documentary record including, at minimum, (1) the original or a copy of each actual notice personally served or sent via registered mail pursuant to 25 USC 1912(a), and (2) the original or a legible copy of the return receipt or other proof of service showing delivery of the notice.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Finally, we hold that the proper remedy for an ICWA-notice violation is to conditionally reverse the trial court and remand for resolution of the ICWA-notice issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">In both the instant cases there existed sufficient indicia of Indian heritage to trigger the notice requirement of 25 USC 1912(a), yet neither trial court determined whether tribal notice had been properly made. Thus, in neither case did the trial courts determine whether \u2014 in addition to state law \u2014 the substantive and procedural protections of ICWA applied to the child custody proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">Therefore, in <em>In re Morris </em>we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals with regard to the use of the conditional-affirmance remedy, conditionally reverse the trial court\u2019s termination of parental rights, and remand to the trial court for resolution of the ICWAnotice issue. In <em>In re Gordon </em>we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals, conditionally reverse the trial court\u2019s termination of parental rights, and remand to the trial court for resolution of the ICWA-notice issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">In both cases, parental rights were terminated pursuant to Michigan law, even though the trial courts never conclusively determined whether ICWA applied to the proceedings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">A. <em>In re MORRIS</em></p>\n<p id=\"b206-7\">C. I. Morris is the daughter of N. Brumley and D. Morris. The Department of Human Services (DHS) became involved in December 2008 when the newborn child tested positive for cocaine. Brumley admitted using cocaine and engaging in prostitution while pregnant. D. Morris admitted that he knew about Brumley\u2019s cocaine use and prostitution. The DHS filed a temporary-custody petition for jurisdiction over the infant and to remove her from her mother\u2019s custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-8\">At the December 11, 2008 preliminary hearing, both parents indicated that they had Indian heritage. The father stated that his great-grandmother was Indian and that he believed she was a member of the Cherokee tribe. The mother stated that her heritage also included Cherokee Indian. Without further addressing the child\u2019s Indian heritage, the trial court ordered the child placed into foster care. The order entered after the preliminary hearing included a checked box for the following statement: \u201cThe child is a member of or eligible for membership in an American Indian tribe or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>band named CHEROKEE (complete and mail form JC48).\u201d Immediately following that statement, the order provided, \u201cThe findings required by MCR 3.980 have been made on the record.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> It appears, however, that tribal notice was never made.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-3\">At the April 7, 2009 adjudication trial, the referee found that one or more of the allegations in the petition were substantiated and that it was proper to exercise jurisdiction over the child. The referee further ordered both parents to comply with parent-agency agreements (PAA), with the goal being reunification. Approximately one year later, the trial court ordered the DHS to file a supplemental petition seeking termination of both parents\u2019 parental rights because they had failed to substantially comply with their PAAs and had failed to benefit from the services that were offered. On July 21, 2010, the referee found that the child could not safely be returned to the parents within the foreseeable future and the court terminated both parents\u2019 parental rights, finding that the cited statutory grounds were demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence and that termination was in the child\u2019s best interests.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">Brumley and D. Morris appealed, but did not raise the Indian-heritage issue in the Court of Appeals. Instead, the DHS raised sua sponte the insufficiency of notice to the Indian tribe under ICWA. In its response to the parents\u2019 consolidated appeals, the Attorney General admitted that the record did not disclose whether ICWA notification had been completed. Rather than reverse the trial court, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>Attorney General urged the Court of Appeals to conditionally affirm the termination but remand so that proper notice could be provided to any interested tribe. The Court of Appeals affirmed the termination, however, without addressing the ICWA-notice issue or petitioner\u2019s admission of error. See <em>In re Morris, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued February 17, 2011 (Docket Nos. 299470 and 299471).</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">D. Morris alone applied for leave to appeal in this Court. In lieu of granting leave to appeal, we vacated that portion of the Court of Appeals judgment resolving the father\u2019s appeal and remanded to the Court of Appeals for resolution of the ICWA-notice issue. In doing so, we expressly retained jurisdiction. <em>In re Morris, </em>489 Mich 877 (2011). On remand, the Court of Appeals readopted its February 17,2011 opinion with regard to termination of D. Morris\u2019s parental rights, conditionally affirmed the termination of parental rights with regard to both parents, and remanded to the trial court for resolution of the ICWAnotice issue. <em>In re Morris, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued May 19,2011 (Docket Nos. 299470 and 299471). We granted D. Morris\u2019s application for leave to appeal, \u201climited to the issue whether the Court of Appeals \u2018conditional affirmance\u2019 remedy is an appropriate method of resolving an ICWA violation.\u201d <em>In re Morris, </em>489 Mich 957 (2011). We now reverse, but only with regard to the use of the conditional-affirmance remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">B. <em>In </em>re <em>GORDON</em></p>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">C. Hinkle gave birth to J. L. Gordon in May 2007.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> When JL was just a few months old, Shiawassee County Child Protective Services (CPS) received a referral for neglect and improper supervision. Hinkle and JL were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>living in a condemned house with no electricity or running water, and Hinkle admitted being in an abusive relationship with a gang member and her own involvement with the gang. Hinkle also admitted that she fed the baby adult table food, that she did not regularly bathe him or change his diapers, and that she sometimes shook him and threw him to other persons. Shiawassee County CPS referred Hinkle for services, but she failed to participate and eventually went missing with JL.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">In November 2007, while Hinkle was in jail on an unrelated conviction, she placed JL in a guardianship with Hinkle\u2019s maternal aunt, a Saginaw Chippewa tribal member. But when Hinkle was released from jail, the guardianship was terminated and JL returned to Hinkle\u2019s care. In May 2008, Hinkle resurfaced in Oakland County, and CPS again became involved after receiving a referral alleging that JL had been treated for second-degree burns to his hands after falling into a fireplace and that Hinkle had failed to bring the child back to the hospital\u2019s burn unit for follow-up care. When CPS found Hinkle, the caseworker ordered Hinkle to take JL to the hospital for treatment of his burned hands. Hinkle apparently did not do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">The child was taken into protective custody. Caseworker Nina Bailey filed a petition on behalf of the DHS, seeking temporary jurisdiction over JL, which was granted on May 22, 2008. On July 21, 2008, Hinkle pleaded no contest to the allegations in the petition, and the court ordered Hinkle to comply with a PAA. Following a dispositional hearing in September 2008, JL was placed back with Hinkle\u2019s maternal aunt, the Saginaw Chippewa tribal member who had previously served as JL\u2019s guardian.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>By April 2010, Hinkle had made little progress toward reunification. Her compliance with the PAA was sporadic and incomplete, she had been arrested on an unrelated criminal charge, she was requesting shorter and less frequent visitations with JL, and she continued to maintain inappropriate living conditions. At an April 8, 2010 permanency planning hearing, the court recommended that the DHS file a supplemental petition seeking termination of Hinkle\u2019s parental rights. After a three-day bifurcated hearing concluding on November 1, 2010, the court terminated Hinkle\u2019s parental rights, finding that each of the statutory grounds alleged in the petition had been proven by clear and convincing evidence and that termination was in JL\u2019s best interests.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">The facts relevant to the ICWA-notice issue developed over the course of numerous hearings. At the May 21, 2008 hearing during which the DHS sought emergency custody of JL, Bailey indicated that neither Hinkle nor JL was a member of an Indian tribe and that they were not eligible for tribal membership. However, at the preliminary hearing on May 22, 2008, Hinkle stated that her family was part of the Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe in Mt. Pleasant. Hinkle seemed to indicate that she was not a member of the tribe, but the referee did not conclusively determine Hinkle\u2019s tribal status. Without further clarification from Hinkle, the referee stated: \u201cThat\u2019s okay, don\u2019t worry about it. So I will order DHS to do an investigation regarding that and notify the tribe for us and see if they want to respond to this case.\u201d The order issued after a June 3, 2008 hearing indicates \u201cICWA has been notified.\u201d At a hearing held on July 21, 2008, Bailey was asked about the status of the tribal notification. Bailey responded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>that she had sent a certified letter to the Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe and was notified by return receipt that the letter had been received, but she had not heard back from the tribe regarding membership or eligibility for membership.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">At a September 2008 dispositional review hearing, Hinkle clarified that her biological mother was not a member of the tribe, but her mother\u2019s siblings were. Hinkle\u2019s mother was present in the courtroom and confirmed that there was Indian heritage on her side of the family and that she was \u201cwaiting on that,\u201d which apparently meant that she was waiting to hear from the tribe about her own eligibility for membership. The assistant prosecutor reiterated that notice had been sent to the Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe, but no response had been received. The court directed the prosecutor to place a copy of the notice in the court file, and she agreed to do so, but the record does not include a copy of the notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">At a hearing held on January 5, 2009, DHS caseworker Lisa Smith stated that an ICWA representative had requested more family history information from Hinkle, that the requested information had been provided, and that the DHS was awaiting a response. The court directed Smith to notify it when a response was received and place a copy in the court file. Smith agreed to do so, but again, the record includes no such ICWA documentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">At an April 21, 2009 hearing, Smith told the court that Hinkle\u2019s mother had received direct notice from the tribe that the family was not eligible for tribal benefits. Hinkle\u2019s mother was present and stated that she had been notified that she and her descendents were not entitled to tribal benefits or money. Hinkle then attempted to clarify for her mother, stating, \u201cMy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>son and I don\u2019t have enough heritage to get \u2014 to be part of the tribe in other words.\u201d The court stated that it was looking for \u201ca letter\u201d directly from the tribe. JL\u2019s foster mother stated that she is a tribal member and had tried to obtain information regarding JL\u2019s status from the tribe, but the tribe had refused to release the information to anyone but the DHS or the court. Smith reiterated that she had \u201csent papers to ICWA.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The court notified Smith that she needed to \u201ccontact them to see why they haven\u2019t responded because we need the response directly from ICWA. And they\u2019re not going to send it to anybody else, they\u2019re going to send it to the [DHS] because you\u2019re the one that\u2019s making the request.\u201d Smith agreed to contact the tribe.</p>\n<p id=\"b212-5\">On April 6, 2009, the court entered an order following a hearing, which noted, \u201cNothing received from ICWA \u2014 worker contacted ICWA again.\u201d This is the last reference to ICWA that appears in the record. The record includes no copies of the actual notices purportedly sent to either the Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe or the Secretary of the Interior. There are no postal return receipts indicating whether notice was received and, if so, by whom. Lastly, the record includes no documentation of any tribal response or other subsequent communications documenting the court\u2019s and the DHS\u2019s efforts to ensure compliance with ICWA.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>Hinkle appealed the November 2010 termination decision, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. <em>In re Gordon, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued August 11, 2011 (Docket No. 301592). The Court of Appeals noted that Hinkle had objected to neither the manner nor the insufficiency of tribal notice pursuant to ICWA and concluded that, even in the absence of documentation, the record showed that the DHS had complied with ICWA. <em>Id. </em>at 4. Further, the Court of Appeals concluded that by stating that she and her son were not eligible for tribal membership, Hinkle had relieved the trial court from making further tribal-notification efforts. <em>Id. </em>Hinkle applied for leave to appeal in this Court, and pursuant to MCR 7.302(H)(1), we directed the clerk to schedule oral argument on whether to grant the application or take other action. <em>In re Gordon, </em>490 Mich 917 (2011). Having heard oral arguments, we now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b213-6\">Issues involving the application and interpretation of ICWA are questions of law that are reviewed de novo. <em>In re JL, </em>483 Mich 300, 318; 770 NW2d 853 (2009). A court\u2019s factual findings underlying the application of legal issues are reviewed for clear error. <em>People v LoCicero (After Remand), </em>453 Mich 496, 500; 556 NW2d 498 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">III. THE INDIAN CHILD WELFARE ACT</p>\n<p id=\"b213-8\">In 1978, Congress enacted ICWA in response to growing concerns over \u201cabusive child welfare practices that resulted in the separation of large numbers of Indian children from their families and tribes through adoption or foster care placement, usually in non-Indian homes.\u201d <em>Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number><em>Holyfield, </em>490 US 30, 32; 109 S Ct 1597; 104 L Ed 2d 29 (1989). Senate hearings conducted between 1974 and 1978 considered the harm of these child welfare practices, not only to the Indian children and their parents, but also to the Indian tribes. <em>Id. </em>at 32-34. In its statement of findings, Congress expressed the importance of protecting and preserving Indian families, Indian tribes, and tribal culture, stating the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-5\">(3) that there is no resource that is more vital to the continued existence and integrity of Indian tribes than their children ...;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-6\">(4) that an alarmingly high percentage of Indian families are broken up by the removal, often unwarranted, of their children from them by nontribal public and private agencies and that an alarmingly high percentage of such children are placed in non-Indian foster and adoptive homes and institutions; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-7\">(5) that the States, exercising their recognized jurisdiction over Indian child custody proceedings through administrative and judicial bodies, have often failed to recognize the essential tribal relations of Indian people and the cultural and social standards prevailing in Indian communities and families. [25 USC 1901.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-8\">In response to these findings, Congress declared that the policy of our nation is</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-9\">to protect the best interests of Indian children and to promote the stability and security of Indian tribes and families by the establishment of minimum Federal standards for the removed of Indian children from their families and the placement of such children in foster or adoptive homes which will reflect the unique values of Indian culture .... [25 USC 1902.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b214-10\">Thus, reflected in ICWA is a profound recognition of the separate and distinct rights of Indian tribes to their children, the most critical resource necessary to preserve not only tribal culture, but the tribes themselves. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>To address the problems identified in the hearings, ICWA establishes various substantive and procedural protections intended to govern child custody proceedings involving Indian children.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">Two provisions define the exclusive or presumptive jurisdiction of the tribal courts over Indian children. First, if an Indian child \u201cresides or is domiciled within the reservation of such tribe\u201d or is a \u201cward of a tribal court,\u201d the child\u2019s tribe has exclusive jurisdiction \u201cover any child custody proceeding.\u201d 25 USC 1911(a). Second, in state court foster care or termination of parental rights proceedings involving Indian children who are not wards of the tribal court and are not residents of or domiciled within a reservation, the parent, the Indian custodian of the child, or the Indian child\u2019s tribe may petition for the proceedings to be transferred to the tribal court. 25 USC 1911(b). In the absence of good cause to the contrary or declination by the tribal court, the state court \u201cshall transfer\u201d the proceedings to the tribal court. <em>Id. </em>Further, if the child is an Indian child and jurisdiction is not transferred to the tribal court, the child\u2019s tribe retains the right to intervene in any state court foster care placement or termination of parental rights proceeding. 25 USC 1911(c). Regardless of whether the tribe intervenes, if the child involved in the child custody proceeding is an Indian child, state courts must still conform to the heightened protections afforded by ICWA.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Therefore, before a state court can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>determine whether ICWA applies to the proceedings, the court must first make the critical determination whether the child is an \u201cIndian child.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b216-5\">As defined by ICWA, an \u201cIndian child\u201d is \u201cany unmarried person who is under age eighteen and is either (a) a <em>member </em>of an Indian tribe or (b) is <em>eligible for membership </em>in an Indian tribe and is the biological child of a <em>member </em>of an Indian tribe.\u201d 25 USC 1903(4) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Aside from the age and marital-status components, both subparts (a) and (b) require a determination of tribal membership or eligibility for tribal membership, and it is well established that only the Indian tribe can determine its membership. <em>In re Shawboose, </em>175 Mich App 637, 639; 438 NW2d 272 (1989). Therefore, when there are sufficient indications that the child may be an Indian child, the ultimate determination requires that the tribe receive notice of the child custody proceedings, so that the tribe may advise the court of the child\u2019s membership status. And thus, ICWA includes 25 USC 1912(a), the notice provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b216-6\">Before turning to the specifics of the notice provision, however, we must briefly discuss ICWA\u2019s enforcement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number>provision, 25 USC 1914, which provides a powerful collateral remedy for violations of ICWA\u2019s key provisions. That section provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b217-5\">Any Indian child who is the subject of any action for foster care placement or termination of parental rights under State law, any parent or Indian custodian from whose custody such child was removed, <em>and the Indian child\u2019s tribe </em>may petition any court of competent jurisdiction to invalidate such action upon a showing that such action violated <em>any provision </em>of [25 USC 1911, 1912, or 1913], [25 USC 1914 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">Pursuant to this provision \u2014 and with no apparent time limitation on when the collateral action may be brought \u2014 the Indian child, a parent, an Indian custodian of the child, or the child\u2019s tribe may petition a court to invalidate foster care placements and terminations of parental rights if the state court violated <em>any </em>provision included in 25 USC 1911, 1912, or 1913. The import of this powerful remedy is that such an action to invalidate the proceedings could be brought even after the children had established permanency with a new family.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Accordingly, the availability of the 25 USC 1914 remedy for violations of ICWA\u2019s key provisions must inform our decision, compelling us to decide this case in a way that urges our trial courts to ensure compliance with ICWA, including compliance with the notice provision.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b218-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>IV THE NOTICE PROVISION OF ICWA, 25 USC 1912(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b218-5\">The notice provision of ICWA provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-6\">In any involuntary proceeding in a State court, where the court knows or has reason to know that an Indian child is involved, the party seeking the foster care placement of, or termination of parental rights to, an Indian child shall notify the parent or Indian custodian and the Indian child\u2019s tribe, by registered mail with return receipt requested, of the pending proceedings and of their right of intervention. If the identity or location of the parent or Indian custodian and the tribe cannot be determined, such notice shall be given to the Secretary in like manner, who shall have fifteen days after receipt to provide the requisite notice to the parent or Indian custodian and the tribe. No foster care placement or termination of parental rights proceeding shall be held until at least ten days after receipt of notice by the parent or Indian custodian and the tribe or the Secretary: <em>Provided, </em>That the parent or Indian custodian or the tribe shall, upon request, be granted up to twenty additional days to prepare for such proceeding. [25 USC 1912(a).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">Several requirements can easily be extracted from the plain text of the statute. First, 25 USC 1912(a) applies only to <em>involuntary </em>foster care placements and <em>involun</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number><em>tary </em>termination of parental rights proceedings occurring in state courts.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Second, if the \u201cknows or has reason to know\u201d notice condition is triggered, the party seeking foster care placement or termination of parental rights has a duty to send notice of the proceedings to (1) the parent or Indian custodian and (2) the Indian child\u2019s tribe. Third, the notice must be sent by registered mail with return receipt requested. Fourth, the contents of the notice must advise, at minimum, of both the pending proceedings and the right of the party receiving the notice to intervene. Fifth, if the party seeking termination cannot ascertain the identity of either (1) the parent or Indian custodian of the child or (2) the Indian child\u2019s tribe, then notice must be sent to the \u201cSecretary,\u201d meaning the Secretary of the Interior.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Sixth, once the party seeking foster care placement or termination of parental rights receives the return receipt showing that delivery of notice has been made, a clock begins to run from the date of delivery shown on the return receipt. The tribe, parent, or Indian custodian has 10 days beginning on the date of receipt to respond to the notice, but may request up to an additional 20 days. Seventh, the trial court may hold no foster care placement or termination of parental rights proceedings until after the stated time periods have elapsed.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Thus, if the notice condition is triggered, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>requisite notice must be sent and \u2014 other than necessary temporary orders pending resolution of the ICWA matter \u2014 the trial court may not hold any proceedings regarding either foster care placement or termination of parental rights until after passage of the requisite waiting periods: 10 days, or up to an additional 20 days if requested.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">The application of the requirements of 25 USC 1912(a), however, is conditioned on whether the notice requirement is even triggered by indicia of Indian heritage sufficient to give the court actual knowledge or a \u201creason to know\u201d that the child at issue is an Indian child.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">A. THE MEANING OF \u201cREASON TO KNOW\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b220-7\">As we have noted, the requirements of 25 USC 1912(a) apply only when \u201cthe court knows or has reason to know that an Indian child is involved . . . .\u201d There is no difficulty in a situation where the court knows an Indian child is involved. In that case, the court would be privy to sufficient information to determine that the child satisfies the definition of \u201cIndian child\u201d set forth in 25 USC 1903(4) (i.e., the child is unmarried, under age 18, and either [a] a member of an Indian tribe or [b] eligible for membership and the biological child of a member of an Indian tribe). The difficulty arises when the court \u201chas reason to know that an Indian child is involved . . . .\u201d Specifically, how much information suggesting the child has or may have Indian heritage suffices to give the court \u201creason to know\u201d that an Indian child is involved?</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>We think the \u201creason to know\u201d standard for purposes of the notice requirement in 25 USC 1912(a) should set a rather low bar. First, we find instructive the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) guidelines, which suggest a permissive standard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-5\">Circumstances under which a state court has <em>reason to believe </em>a child involved in a child custody proceeding is an Indian include but are not limited to the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-6\">(i) Any party to the case, Indian tribe Indian organization or public or private agency informs the court that the child is an Indian child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-7\">(ii) Any public or state-licensed agency involved in child protection services or family support has discovered <em>information which suggests that the child is an Indian child.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-8\">(iii) The child who is the subject of the proceeding gives the court <em>reason to believe </em>he or she is an Indian child.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-9\">(iv) The residence or the domicile of the child, his or her biological parents, or the Indian custodian is known by the court to be or is shown to be a predominantly Indian community.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b221-10\">(v) An officer of the court involved in the proceeding has knowledge that the child <em>may be an Indian child. </em>[Bureau of Indian Affairs, Guidelines for State Courts; Indian Child Custody Proceedings, B.l(c), 44 Fed Reg 67584, 67586 (November 26, 1979) (BIA Guidelines) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b221-11\">By using the terms \u201creason to believe,\u201d \u201csuggests,\u201d and \u201cmay be an Indian child,\u201d this nonexhaustive list adopts a permissive standard we find consistent with the purposes animating ICWA. Further, our State Court Administrative Office recently adopted the BIA standards, with some slight variations, in its ICWA resource guide.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>Second, we also find instructive <em>BH v People ex rel XH, </em>138 P3d 299, 303 (Colo, 2006), in which the Colorado Supreme Court examined this same issue and noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b222-5\">Precisely what constitutes \u201creason to know\u201d or \u201creason to believe\u201d in any particular set of circumstances will necessarily evade meaningful description. As in other contexts, reasonable grounds to believe must depend upon the totality of the circumstances and include consideration of not only the nature and specificity of available information but also the credibility of the source of that information and the basis of the source\u2019s knowledge. In light of the purpose of [ICWA], however, to permit tribal involvement in child-custody determinations whenever tribal members are involved, the threshold requirement for notice was clearly not intended to be high.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">The court examined the BIA Guidelines and cases from other jurisdictions before concluding that \u201c[b]ecause membership is peculiarly within the province of each Indian tribe, <em>sufficiently reliable information of virtually any criteria upon which membership might be based </em>must be considered adequate to trigger the notice provisions of the Act.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 304 (emphasis added); see also <em>In re Antoinette S, </em>104 Cal App 4th 1401, 1407; 129 Cal Rptr 2d 15 (2002) (\u201c[T]he \u2018minimal showing\u2019 required to trigger notice under the ICWA is merely evidence <em>\u2018suggesting] </em>\u2019 the minor \u2018may\u2019 be an Indian child .. . .\u201d), quoting <em>Dwayne P v Superior Court, </em>103 Cal App 4th 247, 258; 126 Cal Rptr 2d 639 (2002) (second alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b222-7\">Third, we think the burden on the trial court and the DHS of complying with the notice requirement is minimal when compared to the potential costs of erroneously failing to send notice. At most, complying with 25 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>USC 1912(a) will extend the proceedings by some 30 days after the date the tribe or the Secretary of the Interior receives notice. If those entitled to notice do not respond within 10 days, the trial court may conduct the foster care placement or termination of parental rights proceedings. If the tribe replies to the notice, indicating that the child is not a member of the tribe and is not entitled to membership then, again, proceedings may resume. Finally, if those entitled to notice request an additional 20 days, then the court may have to wait a total of 30 days beyond the date the notice was received, as shown by the return receipt. An additional 30 days seems a comparatively low burden on the trial court and the DHS, especially when child custody cases generally take well over a year and the Indian heritage question will normally be raised at least by the time of the preliminary hearing. MCR 3.965(B)(2).<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> However, if the trial court errs by concluding that no notice is required and proceeds to place the child into foster care <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>or terminate parental rights, the purposes of ICWA are frustrated and the Indian child, the parent or Indian custodian, or the Indian child\u2019s tribe may petition to have the proceedings invalidated pursuant to 25 USC 1914. Thus, the cost of making 25 USC 1912(a) notice is far less than the potential cost of incorrectly deciding that no notice is required.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we adopt the permissive standard articulated by the Colorado Supreme Court and hold that sufficiently reliable information of virtually any criteria on which membership might be based is adequate to trigger the notice requirement of 25 USC 1912(a).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Once sufficient indicia of Indian heritage are presented to give the court a reason to believe the child is or may be an Indian child, resolution of the child\u2019s and parent\u2019s tribal status requires notice to the tribe or, when the appropriate tribe cannot be determined, to the Secretary of the Interior. If there must be error in determining whether tribal notice is required, let it be on the side of caution.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> See <em>In re MCP, </em>153 Vt 275, 289; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>571 A2d 627 (1989) (\u201cTo maintain stability in placements of children in juvenile proceedings, it is preferable to err on the side of giving notice and examining thoroughly whether the juvenile is an Indian child.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">In the instant cases, we agree with the trial courts\u2019 initial determinations that there existed sufficient indicia of Indian heritage to require tribal notice. In <em>Morris, </em>both parents informed the court at the December 11, 2008 preliminary hearing that they had Cherokee Indian heritage. And while the record does not reflect whether any attempt to provide notice was made at that time, the order entered after the preliminary hearing indicates that \u201c[t]he child is a member of or eligible for membership in an American Indian tribe or band named CHEROKEE . . . .\u201d Likewise in <em>Gordon, </em>Hinkle informed the court at the May 22, 2008 preliminary hearing that her family was part of the Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe, and the referee indicated that the DHS would be required to notify the Saginaw Chippewa tribe to conclusively resolve the issue. Thus, in both cases, we agree that the tribal-notice requirement of 25 USC 1912(a) was triggered because sufficient indicia of Indian heritage were presented to give the courts reason to believe that the children might be Indian children.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>B. PARENTAL WAIVER OF THE TRIBAL RIGHT TO NOTICE</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">In <em>Gordon, </em>we asked the parties to address whether a parent can waive a minor child\u2019s status as an Indian child or waive compliance with ICWA. This issue is easily resolved in the negative: a parent cannot waive either a child\u2019s status as an Indian child or any of the tribe\u2019s separate and distinct rights, as guaranteed by ICWA \u2014 including the right to notice under 25 USC 1912(a). The act makes clear that Indian tribes have \u201can interest in the child which is distinct from but on a parity with the interest of the parents.\u201d <em>In re Adoption of Halloway, </em>732 P2d 962, 969 (Utah, 1986), quoted in <em>Holyfield, </em>490 US at 52. In <em>Holyfield, </em>the United States Supreme Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b226-6\">The numerous prerogatives accorded the tribes through the ICWA\u2019s substantive provisions .. . must, accordingly, be seen as a means of protecting not only the interests of individual Indian children and families, but also of the tribes themselves. <em>[Holyfield, </em>490 US at 49.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b226-7\">In recognition of the tribe\u2019s protected interests in its children, the Court held that \u201c[t]ribal jurisdiction under \u00a7 1911(a) was not meant to be defeated by the actions of individual members of the tribe,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 49, and allowing a parent to avoid the tribe\u2019s right to exclusive jurisdiction over reservation domiciliaries would \u201cnullify the purpose the ICWA was intended to accomplish,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 52. While the <em>Holyfield </em>case is framed within the tribal right to exclusive jurisdiction, we conclude that the same principles hold true in the context of the tribal right to notice. Providing notice is a critical step to determining whether the separate and distinct tribal interests protected by ICWA are implicated. Tribes must be afforded the \u201copportunity to participate in determining whether the child is an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>Indian and to be heard on the issue of ICWA applicability.\u201d <em>BH, </em>138 P3d at 303 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">Therefore, we hold that a parent cannot waive a child\u2019s status as an Indian child or any right of the tribe that is guaranteed by ICWA. See <em>id. </em>at 304 (\u201cBecause the protection of a separate tribal interest is at the core of the ICWA,... otherwise sufficiently rehable information cannot be overcome by the statements, actions, or waiver of a parent____\u201d), citing Holyfield, 490 US at 49, 52; <em>In re Marinna J, </em>90 Cal App 4th 731, 733; 109 Cal Rptr 2d 267 (2001) (\u201cBecause the notice requirement is intended, in part, to protect the interests of Indian tribes, it cannot be waived by the parents\u2019 failure to raise it.\u201d). The Court of Appeals in <em>Gordon </em>clearly erred by holding that Hinkle\u2019s clarification had relieved the trial court from making further tribal-notification efforts.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">C. 25 USC 1912(a) RECORDKEEPING REQUIREMENTS</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">In <em>Gordon, </em>490 Mich 917, we asked the parties to address \u201cwhether the Department of Human Services and the family court are under a duty to make a complete record of their compliance with the notice requirements of the ICWA. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> While the DHS per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>sonnel and the prosecutor made numerous assertions at various hearings that notice had been sent, the record in <em>Gordon </em>is devoid of any documentation of the DHS\u2019s efforts to notify either the Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe or the Secretary of the Interior. There are no copies of the actual notice purportedly sent. Nor does the record include any original or copy of a registered mail return receipt, which is necessary to show not only that notice was received, but also to determine when the 25 USC 1912(a) waiting period begins.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Lastly, while caseworker Smith stated to the trial court on January 5, 2009, that she had received and responded to a request for more family-history information, no documentation of that correspondence appears in the record. This is so even though the court repeatedly instructed both the prosecutor and Smith to ensure that copies of the ICWA-related documents were placed in the court file. It is thus impossible to discern from the record in <em>Gordon </em>whether notice was actually sent, to whom it was sent, and whether the notices were received by the appropriate recipients.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>While ICWA is silent regarding the recordkeeping requirements of 25 USC 1912(a) notice compliance, we find it essential that certain documents be included in the record. First, our State Court Administrative Office recently adopted the BIA recommendation that \u201c[t]he original or a copy of each notice sent pursuant to this section shall be filed with the court together with any return receipts or other proof of service.\u201d BIA Guidelines B.5(d), 44 Fed Reg at 67588.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Second, without being able to review the return receipt, the trial court cannot determine whether the proper party actually received the notice sent by registered mail. Third, the trial court cannot determine the date on which the 25 USC 1912(a) waiting period begins to run without knowing the date on which the tribe or the Secretary of the Interior received the notice, as shown by the registered-mail return receipt. Fourth, with no copy of the actual notice in the record, the trial court cannot determine if the contents of the notice provided sufficient, accurate information to enable the tribal authorities to determine tribal status of the child and the child\u2019s parents. Finally, appellate courts cannot fulfill their appellate function without documentation in the record sufficient to allow review of a trial court\u2019s efforts to comply with 25 USC 1912(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-3\">Indeed, <em>Gordon </em>illustrates the necessity for a documentary record of the attempts to comply with the notice requirements of 25 USC 1912(a). The lack of documentation in the record in <em>Gordon </em>prevents us from determining if the contents of the notice were sufficient to apprise the intended recipient of the pending child custody proceeding. We likewise are unable to determine to whom the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>notices were sent, even though the transcript includes references to both the Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe and to \u201cICWA,\u201d the latter of which presumably means the Secretary of the Interior.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Further, there is an assertion in the January 5, 2009 hearing transcript that a notice recipient had requested additional family-background information, but we are unable to review either the purported request or any responses made to the request because the record includes neither. Lastly, we cannot determine when or if the notices were actually received by the Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe, which would allow us to determine when and if the 25 USC 1912(a) waiting period began to run.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Therefore, we hold that trial courts have a duty to ensure that the record includes, at minimum, (1) the original or a copy of each actual notice personally served or sent via registered mail pursuant to 25 USC 1912(a), and (2) the original or a legible copy of the return receipt or other proof of service showing delivery of the notice. In addition, it would be helpful \u2014 especially for appellate purposes \u2014 for the record to include any additional correspondence between the petitioner, the court, and the Indian tribe or other person or entity entitled to notice under 25 USC 1912(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Having determined that the notice requirement of 25 USC 1912(a) was triggered in both cases before us and that the trial courts did not fully comply with that statute, we are left to consider the proper remedy for ICWA-notice violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">V THE PROPER REMEDY: CONDITIONAL REVERSAL</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">Despite the best efforts of child-protection authorities and our trial courts, there will inevitably be the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>occasional, unintentional tribal-notice error. In neither of the instant cases did the trial courts conclusively resolve whether the children were Indian children, and therefore whether the act\u2019s substantive and procedural protections applied to the child custody proceedings was not determined. Although the trial court in <em>Morris </em>determined that tribed notice was required, it appears that notice was not made. And while there were apparently attempts in <em>Gordon </em>to comply with 25 USC 1912(a), the documentary record is insufficient to determine whether the Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe actually received the requisite notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">Because ICWA and our court rules are silent regarding the proper remedy for 25 USC 1912(a) notice violations, we must choose the best of three remedies suggested by the parties and the amici curiae.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> The first suggestion is to automatically reverse any proceedings occurring after the tribal-notice condition of 25 USC 1912(a) was triggered. The second proffered remedy is to conditionally reverse the trial court and remand for resolution of the ICWA-notice issue. The third possibility, which is substantively very similar to the second, is to conditionally affirm the trial court and remand for resolution of the ICWA-notice issue. In <em>In re IEM, </em>233 Mich App 438, 449-450; 592 NW2d 751 (1999), our Court of Appeals adopted the conditionalaffirmance remedy, and it has since been applied in more than 20 cases.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>We are guided in our assessment of these three possible remedies by the following considerations: (1) deference to tribal interests, as expressed by ICWA, (2) the best interests of the children, both Indian and non-Indian, in establishing and maintaining permanency, (3) the need to encourage compliance with ICWA, especially in light of the potential effects of the 25 USC 1914 remedy when errors occur, and (4) the conservation of judicial resources.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">We must first reject the automatic-reversal remedy. The primary argument offered in support of automatic reversal is that once the 25 USC 1912(a) notice requirement is triggered, the court has no jurisdiction to enter any foster care or termination of parental rights orders pending resolution of the tribal-notice issue. Therefore, it is argued, any proceedings occurring after the notice requirement was triggered must be automatically reversed. The main case cited in support of this argument is <em>In re NAH, </em>418 NW2d 310, 311 (SD, 1988), in which the South Dakota Supreme Court concluded that \u201cinadequate notice to the tribes divests the trial court of jurisdiction to terminate parental rights to these Indian children; consequently, this court has no jurisdiction to address the merits of the case.\u201d The critical difference in <em>NAH, </em>however, was that the mother was a member of the Oglala Sioux Tribe and the court was able to positively conclude that the children were \u201cIndian children entitled to the benefits and protections of [ICWA].\u201d <em>Id. </em>Thus, because the court knew that ICWA applied to the proceedings, it was appropriate to auto<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>matically reverse the termination of parental rights.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The situation in <em>NAH </em>is not present in either of the instant cases, however, because it has yet to be determined whether the children involved are Indian children, whether ICWA applies, and whether the tribal court or the state court has jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">Although the automatic-reversal remedy would be the most deferential to tribal interests and would be the most effective in stressing to courts the imperative need to comply with ICWA, we decline to adopt the argument that the mere triggering of notice pursuant to 25 USC 1912(a) strips the state court of jurisdiction over the matter and requires immediate return of the children to the home from which they were removed. Several ICWA provisions indicate that Congress did not intend for state courts to lose jurisdiction once the 25 USC 1912(a) notice requirement is triggered. For example, pursuant to 25 USC 1922, a state court may conduct an emergency removal and arrange temporary foster care placement of even a child over whom the tribal court has exclusive jurisdiction when an Indian child \u201cwho is a resident of or is domiciled on a reservation\u201d is \u201ctemporarily located off the reservation . . . .\u201d While ICWA does not address those children not explicitly covered by 25 USC 1922, it would make no sense for Congress to allow for emergency removal and temporary placement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>of Indian children over whom the Indian tribe has exclusive jurisdiction pursuant to 25 USC 1911(a), yet preclude those emergency and temporary measures for all others, especially when it has yet to be determined if the child qualifies as an Indian child and whether the tribal court has exclusive jurisdiction over, the right to intervene in, or no interest in the matter. See, e.g., <em>DED v State, </em>704 P2d 774, 779 (Alas, 1985) (holding that the notice requirements of 25 USC 1912(a) do not apply to emergency custody proceedings held pursuant to 25 USC 1922); <em>In re SB, </em>130 Cal App 4th 1148, 1162-1164; 30 Cal Rptr 3d 726 (2005) (recognizing the absurdity of applying various ICWA provisions to temporary detention proceedings and holding that Congress intended 25 USC 1922 \u201cto apply to emergency removals and placements of <em>all </em>Indian children,\u201d not just those domiciled or residing within the reservation), citing HR Rep No. 95-1386, 2d Sess, p 25 (1978), reprinted in 1978 US Code Cong'&amp; Admin News, pp 7530, 7548.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Further, even when a petitioner has improperly removed an Indian child from the home or improperly retained custody, the child need not be returned to her or his parent or Indian custodian if doing so \u201cwould subject the child to a substantial and immediate danger or threat of such danger.\u201d 25 USC 1920. Finally, our conclusion is reinforced by the fact that 25 USC 1912(a) contains no reference to jurisdiction. It seems unlikely that Congress would have intended the triggering of tribal notice under 25 USC 1912(a) to divest a court of jurisdiction, yet would choose not to include the word \u201cjurisdiction\u201d within the provision. The conspicuous absence of any reference to jurisdiction in 25 USC 1912(a) becomes especially meaningful when one considers that other ICWA provisions provide detailed treatment of jurisdiction. See 25 USC 1911(a) (exclusive tribal jurisdiction); 25 USC 1911(b) (presumptive tribal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>jurisdiction); 25 USC 1918 (tribal reassumption of jurisdiction); 25 USC 1919 (authorization for states and tribes to enter into jurisdictional agreements). We thus conclude that Congress was well aware of the jurisdictional issues central to ICWA, yet chose not to make the mere triggering of the notice requirement in 25 USC 1912(a) a jurisdictional issue. <em>See Antoinette S, </em>104 Cal App 4th at 1410-1411 (holding that violations of the 25 USC 1912(a) waiting period are not jurisdictional and reasoning that \u201cif [the] error were to strip a court of its jurisdiction . . ., then the juvenile court would lose all authority over the dependent child in its care, requiring immediate return of the child to parents who have demonstrated at least temporary unfitness\u201d). Whether the tribal court has exclusive, presumptive, or no jurisdiction over the matter cannot even be determined in the absence of proper notice to the tribal authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">Therefore, we conclude that the mere triggering of the notice requirement does not strip the trial court of jurisdiction over the children and does not mandate automatic reversal of all proceedings occurring after the notice requirement was triggered. The requirement to provide tribal notice under 25 USC 1912(a) is the <em>means </em>by which a court determines its jurisdiction, but is not itself a divestiture of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">We also do not believe that automatic reversal would be in the best interests of the children. In the majority of cases involving ICWA-notice violations that were conditionally affirmed by the Michigan Court of Appeals, it was eventually determined that the children were not Indian children and thus that ICWA did not apply. An automatic-reversal rule would require new termination proceedings in even the cases not involving Indian children, and this would disrupt or delay the permanent placement of the child. It would be counter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>productive and nonsensical to disrupt the permanent placement of a child before it is determined whether the child is an Indian child. Additionally, an automatic-reversal rule would not conserve judicial resources because it would require the invalidation of all orders entered when there was an ICWA-notice violation, even if it is later determined that the child is not an Indian child.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-3\">Finally, the automatic-reversal remedy would be inconsistent with our longstanding disfavor of automatic reversals. See <em>In re Osborne, </em>459 Mich 360, 369; 589 NW2d 763 (1999). Therefore, without a showing that ICWA even applies to the foster care or termination of parental rights proceedings, i.e., that the child is an Indian child, we decline to adopt a rule of automatic reversal.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">Our choices thus narrow to either the conditional-reversal or the conditional-affirmance remedy. Other jurisdictions have employed one or the other remedy to ICWA tribal-notice violations. See, e.g., <em>In re Elizabeth W, </em>120 Cal App 4th 900, 908; 16 Cal Rptr 3d 514 (2004) (conditional reversal); <em>In re REKF, </em>698 NW2d 147, 151 (Iowa, 2005) (conditional affirmance).</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">From a practical perspective, we realize there is little difference between the conditional remedies: both require a remand to remedy the notice violation. A conditional affirmance merely states that the lower court ruling is affirmed unless ICWA applies, whereas a conditional reversal states that the ruling is reversed unless ICWA does not apply. Under either remedy, if the child is determined to be an Indian child, then the foster care or termination proceedings are invalidated and the proceedings begin anew under ICWA\u2019s standards. If no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>Indian child is involved, however, or the tribe given proper notice does not respond within the times allotted by 25 USC 1912(a), any notice violation is harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">As far as the best interests of the children, there is again little difference between the conditional-affirmance and conditional-reversal remedies. Under either remedy, the children will likely stay in their current placements until the notice violation is resolved, and thus their permanency is not unduly affected in the interim. Additionally, there is no difference between these remedies as far as conserving judicial resources. Both require a remand to remedy the notice violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">Nevertheless, in other ways, substantial differences exist between the two remedies. First, we think the use of a conditional reversal is more consistent with the text of 25 USC 1912(a), which mandates that \u201c[n]o foster care placement or termination of parental rights proceeding shall be held until at least ten days after receipt of notice by the parent or Indian custodian and the tribe or the Secretary....\u201d Second, between the two remedies, conditional reversal is more deferential to tribal interests, as expressed by ICWA, and is more likely to ensure these interests are protected by the trial courts. The term \u201cconditional reversal\u201d sends a clearer signal to the lower courts and the DHS that they must pay closer attention when ICWA is implicated. In sum, we think that the conditional-reversal remedy is more emphatic, more consistent with the text and purposes animating ICWA, and more likely to encourage compliance with ICWA.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">Therefore, we overrule <em>IEM </em>and its progeny and hold that conditional reversal is the proper remedy for violations of 25 USC 1912(a).<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b238-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>VI. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">We hold that the proper remedy for ICWA-notice violations is to conditionally reverse the trial court and remand for resolution of the ICWA-notice issue. In addition, we hold that virtually any criteria on which tribal membership might be based suffices to trigger the 25 USC 1912(a) notice requirement. We hold also that a parent of an Indian child cannot waive the separate and independent rights of an Indian child\u2019s tribe, as guaranteed by ICWA. Lastly, we hold that the trial court must maintain a documentary record including, at minimum, (1) the original or a copy of each actual notice personally served or sent via registered mail pursuant to 25 USC 1912(a), and (2) the original or a legible copy of the return receipt or other proof of service showing delivery of the notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-6\">In <em>In re Morris </em>we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals with regard to the use of the conditionalaffirmance remedy, conditionally reverse the trial court\u2019s termination of parental rights, and remand to the trial court for resolution of the ICWA-notice issue. In <em>In re Gordon </em>we reverse the judgment of the Court of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>Appeals, conditionally reverse the trial court\u2019s termination of parental rights, and remand to the trial court for resolution of the ICWA-notice issue. On remand, the trial courts shall first ensure that notice is properly made to the appropriate entities. If the trial courts conclusively determine that ICWA does not apply to the involuntary child custody proceedings \u2014 because the children are not Indian children or because the properly noticed tribes do not respond within the allotted time \u2014 the trial courts\u2019 respective orders terminating parental rights are reinstated. If, however, the trial courts conclude that ICWA does apply to the child custody proceedings, the trial courts\u2019 orders terminating parental rights must be vacated and all proceedings must begin anew in accord with the procedural and substantive requirements of ICWA. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<judges id=\"b239-5\">Young, C.J., and Marilyn Kelly, Markman, Hathaway, Mary Beth Kelly, and Zahra, JJ., concurred with CAVANAGH, J.</judges>\n<p id=\"b239-6\">APPENDIX:</p>\n<p id=\"b239-7\">AN OVERVIEW OF THE 25 USC 1912(a) NOTICE PROCESS</p>\n<p id=\"b239-8\">To aid our lower courts in properly applying the notice requirement of 25 USC 1912(a), we offer the following cursory overview. While this overview begins at the preliminary hearing, we recognize that the Department of Human Services, pursuant to its own policies and procedures, will have previously begun the process of gathering the information necessary to determine the applicability of the Indian Child Welfare Act (ICWA). As noted in the opinion, for more comprehensive guidance, see ICWA Special Committee, <em>Indian </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number><em>Child Welfare Act of 1978: A Court Resource Guide </em>(State Court Administrative Office, 2011) (SCAO ICWA Resource Guide).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-3\">1. At the preliminary hearing, the court must inquire about Indian heritage. While MCR 3.965(B)(2) frames the inquiry in terms of actual tribal membership, sufficiently reliable information of virtually any criteria on which membership might be based is adequate to trigger the notice requirement of 25 USC 1912(a). See part IV(A) of the opinion. As we have noted, not all tribes keep written rolls and it is possible for a parent to be unaware that she or he is a member of a tribe. See n 19 of the opinion and accompanying text.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">2. If sufficient indicia of Indian heritage are presented to give the court a reason to believe the child is or may be an Indian child, determination of the tribal status of the child, the parents, or both requires notice pursuant to 25 USC 1912(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">3. The trial court must identify the child\u2019s tribe<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and ensure that the tribe receives notice of the proceedings. If the child\u2019s tribe cannot be determined, notice must be sent to the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA). See n 14 of the opinion and accompanying text. While MCR 3.965(B)(2) states that \u201cthe court must. .. notify the tribe,\u201d the court may discharge its duty by directing the petitioner to compose and send notice containing as much information as is reasonably available to provide the child\u2019s tribe, or the BIA when applicable, with the information needed to make the determination of tribal membership or eligibility for tribal membership. For a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>suggested list of the notice contents, see Bureau of Indian Affairs, Guidelines for State Courts; Indian Child Custody Proceedings, B.5(b), 44 Fed Reg 67584, 67588 (November 26, 1979).</p>\n<p id=\"b241-5\">4. Notice must be made by personal service or sent by registered mail with return receipt requested. See n 22 of the opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-6\">5. Other than temporary placements pending the tribal or BIA notification, the trial court may not conduct any foster care placement or termination of parental rights proceedings until (1) the expiration of the time periods stated in 25 USC 1912(a), or (2) the child\u2019s tribe or the BIA responds with information sufficient to allow the trial court to conclude that the child is not an Indian child within the meaning of ICWA. The possibility that the child is an Indian child does not divest the trial court of jurisdiction to order temporary foster care pending tribal notice. See part V of the opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-7\">6. When the tribe does not have exclusive jurisdiction under 25 USC 1911(a), if the child\u2019s tribe or the BIA responds with information sufficient for the trial court to conclude that the child is an Indian child within the meaning of ICWA and the child\u2019s tribe declines the transfer of jurisdiction or the trial court determines that there exists good cause to keep the matter in state court pursuant to 25 USC 1911(b), the substantive and procedural protections afforded by ICWA still apply to the proceedings. The application of ICWA to the state-court proceedings does not depend on whether the tribe chooses to intervene. See n 29 of the opinion. If the child is an \u201cIndian child,\u201d ICWA applies. See n 9 of the opinion and accompanying text.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-8\">7. The trial court has a duty to ensure the record includes, at minimum, (1) the original or a copy of each <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>actual notice personally served or sent via registered mail pursuant to 25 USC 1912(a), and (2) the original or a legible copy of the return receipt or other proof of service showing delivery of the notice. In addition, the record should include any additional correspondence between the petitioner, the court, and the Indian tribe or other person or entity entitled to notice under 25 USC 1912(a).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b205-7\"> As noted in part IV(C), a complete record should also include any additional correspondence between the Department of Human Services, the trial court, and the Indian tribe or other person or entity entitled to notice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b206-9\"> Assuming ICWA does not apply to these child custody proceedings, we conclude that neither Court of Appeals panel in the instant cases clearly erred in holding that parental rights were properly terminated pursuant to Michigan law. See <em>In re Morris, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued May 19, 2011 (Docket Nos. 299470 and 299471) (readopting the court\u2019s February 17, 2011 opinion with regard to termination under state law); <em>In re Gordon, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued August 11, 2011 (Docket No. 301592).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b207-5\"> At the time of these proceedings, MCR 3.980 was still in effect and required the trial court to ensure that notice of the proceedings was given to the child\u2019s tribe and the child\u2019s parents.

See also MCR 3.002(l)(a) through (d). As discussed within this opinion, \u201cIndian child\u201d is defined by 25 USC 1903(4).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b215-7\"> The various protections afforded by ICWA in proceedings involving Indian children include the appointment of counsel, 25 USC 1912(b); the duty to show that \u201cactive efforts have been made to provide remedial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>services and rehabilitative programs designed to prevent the breakup of the Indian family\u201d in foster care placement or termination of parental rights proceedings, 25 USC 1912(d); a \u201cdetermination, supported by clear and convincing evidence, including testimony of qualified expert witnesses, that the continued custody of the child by the parent or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child\u201d in foster care placement proceedings, 25 USC 1912(e); a \u201cdetermination, supported by evidence beyond a reasonable doubt, including testimony of qualified expert witnesses, that the continued custody of the child by the parent or Indian custodian is likely to result in serious emotional or physical damage to the child\u201d in termination of parental rights proceedings, 25 USC 1912(f); and adoptive, preadoptive, and foster care placement preferences, 25 USC 1915.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b216-8\"> \u201cIndian tribe\u201d is defined as \u201cany Indian tribe, band, nation, or other organized group or community of Indians recognized as eligible for the services provided to Indians by the Secretary [of the Interior] because of their status as Indians ... .\u201d 25 USC 1903(8).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b217-7\"> For example, in <em>Holyfield, </em>the Indian tribe of twin children over which it had exclusive jurisdiction successfully used 25 USC 1914 to challenge a voluntary adoption two months after the entry of the fined decree of adoption. <em>Holyfield, </em>490 US at 38, 53. By the time the United States Supreme Court decided the case \u2014 holding that the chancery court had no jurisdiction to enter the adoption decree \u2014 the children had been with their adoptive parents for more than three years. <em>Id. </em>at 53.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b217-8\"> We point out why 25 USC 1914 is not an available remedy in either of the instant cases. That provision gives standing to the Indian child, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>parents and the Indian custodians of the Indian child, and the Indian child\u2019s tribe. See also 25 USC 1903(9) (defining \u201cparent\u201d). Thus, while any one or more of the four parties may bring an action pursuant to 25 USC 1914, any such action is prefaced on the condition that the child meets the definition of an \u201cIndian child\u201d found in 25 USC 1903(4). Because only the Indian tribe can determine membership or eligibility for membership, an action brought under 25 USC 1914 must necessarily include a tribal determination of membership or eligibility for membership, even though the tribe itself need not intervene in the state-court proceedings. See <em>In re Kreft, </em>148 Mich App 682, 684, 687-689; 384 NW2d 843 (1986) (holding that the respondent-mother in a termination action had standing to challenge the termination under 25 USC 1914, even though the Indian child\u2019s tribe, after intervening in the probate court, did not join the respondent in the appeal). In the instant cases, there have been no determinations that the children are Indian children, and thus, 25 USC 1914 is not available.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b219-5\"> Voluntary foster care placements, voluntary termination of parental rights proceedings, and voluntary adoptive placements are governed by 25 USC 1913.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b219-6\"> \u201cSecretary\u201d is defined as \u201cthe Secretary of the Interior.\u201d 25 USC 1903(11).

As discussed in part Y until the ICWA-notice issue is resolved, the trial court need not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>change, and may order, temporary placements of the children because the mere triggering of 25 USC 1912(a) notice does not divest the court of jurisdiction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b221-12\"> See ICWA Special Committee, <em>Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978: A Court Resource Guide </em>(State Court Administrative Office, 2011), p 22 (hereinafter \u201cSCAO ICWA Resource Guide\u201d), available at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>&lt;http://courts.michigan.gov/scao/resources/publications/manuals/cws/ ICWACtResourceGuide.pdf&gt; (accessed April 27, 2012).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b223-5\"> MCR 3.965(B)(2) requires that the court inquire about Indian heritage at the preliminary hearing. We recognize that MCR 3.965(B)(2) is not entirely consistent with this opinion because the court rule incorporates the definition of \u201cIndian child\u201d into the trial court\u2019s initial determination of whether notice must he sent to the tribe:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-6\">The court must inquire if the child or either parent is a member of an Indian tribe. If the child is a member, or if a parent is a member and the child is eligible for membership in the tribe, the court must determine the identity of the child\u2019s tribe, notify the tribe .... [MCR 3.965(B)(2).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b223-7\">Only after the appropriate tribe responds can it be determined whether a parent, the child, or both are tribal members or are eligible for membership. And only with that information can the trial court determine whether the child meets the definition of \u201cIndian child.\u201d Instead, the court rule should likely reflect a standard of \u201cknows or has reason to know\u201d or \u201cknows or has reason to believe.\u201d This Court is considering opening an administrative file for the purpose of amending MCR 3.965(B)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b224-6\"> A nonexhaustive list of indicia sufficient to trigger tribal notice includes situations in which (1) the trial court has information suggesting that the child, a parent of the child, or members of a parent\u2019s family are tribal members, (2) the trial court has information indicating that the child has Indian heritage, even though no particular Indian tribe can be identified, (3) the child\u2019s birth certificate or other official record indicates that the child or a parent of the child is of Indian descent, (4) the child, the child\u2019s parents, or the child\u2019s Indian custodian resides or is domiciled in a predominantly Indian community and (5) the child or the child\u2019s family has received services or benefits from a tribe or the federal government that are available to Indians. The state of California has codified a similarly permissive standard. See Cal Welf &amp; Inst Code 224.3(b). While we recognize that California law is not binding on Michigan courts, we find California\u2019s codified standard an instructive template for this opinion\u2019s nonexhaustive list of sufficient indicia of Indian heritage. See also BIA Guideline B.l(c), quoted earlier.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b224-7\"> There exist numerous possible scenarios in which a child may not appear to meet the ICWA definition of \u201cIndian child\u201d early in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>proceeding, yet satisfy those conditions at some point during the pendency of the proceedings. For example, a tribe could determine that both a parent and the child are eligible for membership. In that case, if the parent accepts tribal membership, the child would meet ICWA\u2019s definition of \u201cIndian child.\u201d It is likewise possible for a parent to be a tribal member since birth or early childhood, yet not be aware of her or his membership status until the tribe is contacted. See, e.g., <em>In re Termination of Parental Rights to Arianna RG, </em>2003 WI 11, \u00b6 17; 259 Wis 2d 563, 575; 657 NW2d 363 (2003) (noting that while many tribes require enrollment or registration, some automatically include descendents of members).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b227-10\"> We do not think that the purported communication from the tribe to Hinkle\u2019s mother about her eligibility for tribal benefits suffices for any purpose relevant to ICWA. First, the purported letter to Hinkle\u2019s mother had nothing to do with ICWA or the child custody proceedings. Second, it is not clear that ineligibility for tribal benefits equates with ineligibility for tribal membership. Lastly, the trial court was correct to conclude that the tribe\u2019s response to the notice of the child custody proceedings needed to be sent from the tribe or the Secretary of the Interior directly to the DHS or the trial court. A communication from a tribe to a relative of a respondent about eligibility for tribal benefits is insufficient to support any conclusion that ICWA does not apply to the child custody proceedings.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"21\">\n<p id=\"b227-11\"> This issue was not raised in <em>Morris </em>because, by all accounts, there were no efforts to comply with 25 USC 1912(a) after the December 11, 2008 preliminary hearing, during which the trial court found that 25 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>USC 1912(a) was triggered but apparently did not otherwise comply with its requirements. However, our ruling regarding recordkeeping requirements applies equally to <em>Morris </em>on remand.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"22\">\n<p id=\"b228-6\"> We are unable to determine from the record in <em>Gordon </em>whether the notice referred to was sent via registered or certified mail. However, the text of 25 USC 1912(a) specifically requires <em>registered mail. </em>See also MCR 3.920(C)(1) (requiring notice to parents and tribes \u201cby personal service or by registered mail with return receipt requested\u201d). We note that there <em>are </em>differences between certified and registered mail, the latter of which is more secure. Additionally, the BIA recommends that only personal service \u2014 which affords greater protections \u2014 may substitute for registered mail. BIA Guidelines B.5(e), 44 Fed Reg at 67588. Because the trial court did not determine whether tribal notice had been made, we need not opine at this time on whether actual notice achieved via certified mail instead of registered mail would be subject to harmless error review.

When a tribe has exclusive jurisdiction, then of course the state court has no jurisdiction to terminate parental rights. When a tribe merely has presumptive jurisdiction, however, we do not think that inadequate tribal notice automatically divests a state court of jurisdiction. Moreover, the merits of <em>NAH </em>have been questioned.
