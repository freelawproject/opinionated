Defendants moved for summary disposition. The circuit court refused to grant summary disposition, but ordered plaintiffs to appoint a personal representative for the estate of Baby Johnson and to amend the complaint to bring the negligence claim that had been brought on behalf of Baby Johnson through the wrongful-death statute, MCL 600.2922. Defendants appealed by leave granted. The Court of Appeals held that MCL 600.2922, as amended by 2005 PA 270, effective December 19, 2005, to incorporate the language \u201cor death as described in section 2922a,\u201d applied retroactively to plaintiffs\u2019 claim for wrongful death, which arose no later than November 1, 2005. The Court of Appeals further held that Pastoriza\u2019s refusal to perform a cerclage was a \u201cwrongful or negligent act\u201d under MCL 600.2922a.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">We hold that the 2005 amendment of the wrongful-death statute, incorporating the language \u201cor death as described in\u201d MCL 600.2922a, does not apply to claims arising before the effective date of the amendment. The Legislature only intended the 2005 amendment to apply to claims arising on or after the effective date. Further, because defendants would be subjected to liability that did not exist at the time the cause of action arose, the amendment is not remedial and, therefore, cannot be deemed retroactive. Because the 2005 amendment of MCL 600.2922(1), incorporating \u201cdeath as described in\u201d MCL 600.2922a, is <em>not </em>retroactive, plaintiffs can only proceed under MCL 600.2922a.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In regard to plaintiffs\u2019 claim under MCL 600.2922a, we hold that MCL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>600.2922a plainly requires an affirmative act and that an omission or refusal to act cannot constitute an affirmative act. We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case to the circuit court for entry of summary disposition in favor of defendants on the wrongful-death claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">I. FACTUAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Candice had a history of miscarriages because of an incompetent cervix. Using a cerclage procedure between 13 and 16 weeks\u2019 gestation, however, Candice was able to have three consecutive full-term pregnancies. For her next pregnancy, she saw Pastoriza as her obstetrician. Pastoriza was aware of her success with the cerclage procedure and had removed her cerclage suture shortly before she last gave birth.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">In September 2005, Candice experienced vaginal bleeding and went to Foote Hospital in Jackson. Emergency personnel recommended that she rest and meet with her treating obstetrician. A few days later, she saw Pastoriza, but he did not perform a cerclage. At that time an ultrasound showed a live, 12-week-old fetus. On October 12,2005, another ultrasound showed a live fetus at almost 17 weeks\u2019 gestation. The ultrasound also showed that the length of Candice\u2019s cervix was roughly the same as when the previous cerclages had been performed. On October 19, 2005, Candice complained to Pastoriza that she felt preterm, labor-like cramping. She asked Pastoriza to perform a cerclage, but he did not do so. On November 1, 2005, Candice\u2019s cervix dilated and she went into premature labor. She was transferred to Sparrow Hospital in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>Lansing and received an emergency cerclage, but lost the 20-week-old fetus shortly after the transfer. The failed emergency cerclage also resulted in a significant and permanent cervical tear that might prevent Candice from having another child.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">II. LEGAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">Following amendment by 1985 PA 93, subsection (1) of Michigan\u2019s wrongful-death statute, MCL 600.2922(1), provided that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-6\">[w]henever the death of a person or injuries resulting in death shall be caused by wrongful act, neglect, or fault of another, and the act, neglect, or fault is such as would, if death had not ensued, have entitled the party injured to maintain an action and recover damages, the person who or the corporation that would have been hable, if death had not ensued, shall be hable to an action for damages, notwithstanding the death of the person injured, and although the death was caused under circumstances that constitute a felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">This version of MCL 600.2922 did not permit a plaintiff to bring a claim for the death of a nonviable fetus because a nonviable fetus was not viewed as a \u201cperson.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">In 1998, the Legislature created a new statute, MCL 600.2922a. Section 2922a, which became effective on January 1, 1999, is separate from the wrongful-death <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>statute, and imposes liability for wrongful or negligent acts against a pregnant woman that result in the pregnant woman\u2019s miscarriage or stillbirth or \u201cphysical injury\u201d to the fetus. MCL 600.2922a, as added by 1998 PA 2011, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-5\">(1) A person who commits a wrongful or negligent act against a pregnant individual is liable for damages if the act results in a miscarriage or stillbirth by that individual or physical injury to the embryo or fetus.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-6\">(2) This section does not apply to any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-7\">(a) An act committed by the pregnant individual.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-8\">(b) A medical procedure performed by a physician or other licensed medical professional within the scope of his or her practice and with the pregnant individual\u2019s consent or the consent of an individual who may lawfully provide consent on her behalf or without consent as necessitated by a medical emergency.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-9\">(c) The lawful dispensation, administration, or prescription of medication.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-10\">(3) This section does not prohibit a civil action under any other applicable law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-11\">(4) As used in this section, \u201cphysician or other licensed medical professional\u201d means a person licensed under article 15 of the public health code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.16101 to 333.18838.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b539-12\">In 2002, the Legislature amended MCL 600.2922a. The amendment extended civil liability to wrongful or negligent acts that caused the \u201cdeath\u201d of an embryo or fetus and changed the term \u201cmedical professional\u201d to \u201chealth professional.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> MCL 600.2922a, as amended by 2002 PA 164, currently provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>(1) A person who commits a wrongful or negligent act against a pregnant individual is liable for damages if the act results in a miscarriage or stillbirth by that individual, or physical injury to or the death of the embryo or fetus.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-6\">(2) This section does not apply to any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-7\">(a) An act committed by the pregnant individual.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-8\">(b) A medical procedure performed by a physician or other licensed health professional within the scope of his or her practice and with the pregnant individual\u2019s consent or the consent of an individual who may lawfully provide consent on her behalf or without consent as necessitated by a medical emergency.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-9\">(c) The lawful dispensation, administration, or prescription of medication.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-10\">(3) This section does not prohibit a civil action under any other applicable law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-11\">(4) As used in this section, \u201cphysician or other licensed health professional\u201d means a person licensed under article 15 of the public health code, 1978 PA 368, MCL 333.16101 to 333.18838.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-12\">In 2003, the Court of Appeals addressed a medical malpractice action concerning a miscarriage in <em>McClain v Univ of Mich Bd of Regents </em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In <em>McClain, </em>the mother sought to recover damages for emotional distress resulting from the medical malpractice that had caused the miscarriage.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The defendant moved for summary disposition, claiming that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover damages arising from the loss of her deceased fetus.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The trial court granted summary disposition, holding that the plaintiff had failed to state a valid medical malpractice claim \u201cwith regard to delivery of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>nonviable fetus.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">The Court of Appeals reversed.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> It first noted that a wrongful-death action under MCL 600.2922 could not be brought on behalf of the fetus because the wrongful-death statute applied only to a \u201cperson\u201d and the plaintiffs nonviable fetus was not a person.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The mother, therefore, could not recover for loss of society and companionship under MCL 600.2922.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Significantly, the <em>McClain </em>panel did not recognize or address the import of MCL 600.2922a.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">The Legislature amended the wrongful-death statute in 2005 to specifically incorporate and cross-reference MCL 600.2922a. Because of the 2005 amendment, MCL 600.2922(1) currently reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-7\">Whenever the death of a person, injuries resulting in death, <em>or death as described in section 2922a </em>shall be caused by wrongful act, neglect, or fault of another, and the act, neglect, or fault is such as would, if death had not ensued, have entitled the party injured to maintain an action and recover damages, the person who or the corporation that would have been liable, if death had not ensued, shall be liable to an action for damages, notwithstanding the death of the person injured or death as described in section 2922a, and although the death was caused under circumstances that constitute a felony. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">Public Act 270 of 2005 was signed into law and given immediate effect as of December 19, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">III. PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">Plaintiffs filed a complaint against defendants alleging negligence under MCL 600.2922a and medical mal<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>practice. The complaint did not mention wrongful death or MCL 600.2922.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">Defendants moved for summary disposition under MCR 2.116(C)(8) and (C)(10). Defendants first argued that plaintiffs could not sustain a wrongful-death claim for a nonviable fetus under MCL 600.2922 because a nonviable fetus is not a person. Defendants also argued that plaintiffs had failed to state a claim under MCL 600.2922a because there was no allegation that defendants had committed an affirmative act.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">In response, plaintiffs maintained that the refusal to perform a cerclage was an affirmative act. Plaintiffs further argued that MCL 600.2922, as amended by 2005 PA 270, was inapplicable because the amendment took effect after the instant case arose, stating, \u201cIt was not until December, 2005 that the legislature made clear that a cause of action for the death of a fetus under MCL 600.2922a now must be brought as a wrongful death action . . . .\u201d Indeed, they indicated, \u201c[f]or this reason, [p]laintiffs fashioned their complaint on behalf of the fetus under MCL 600.2922a, not under the wrongful death act.\u201d Plaintiffs did posit, however, that \u201cif this Court disagrees, then plaintiff has only to either amend the complaint to add a Count III of wrongful death of the fetus, or bring a separate wrongful death action on behalf of the fetus under MCL 600.2922, and then consolidate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Defendants then filed an additional motion for summary disposition. Defendants argued that the 2005 amendment of MCL 600.2922 was retroactive, and by incorporating references to MCL 600.2922a, MCL 600.2922, as amended by 2005 PA 270, requires that a plaintiff establish, in a case in which \u201cdeath as described in section 2922a\u201d occurs, negligence through an affirmative act.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>After a hearing, the circuit court denied defendants\u2019 motions, finding that plaintiffs could develop a cause of action under MCL 600.2922a through the wrongful-death statute or by pursuing a standard medical malpractice claim under <em>McClain. </em>The court reasoned that Pastoriza\u2019s refusal to perform the cerclage after Candice asked for it could be interpreted under MCL 600.2922a as an affirmative act and that the exception for medical providers did not apply. The court also permitted plaintiffs to amend the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">Defendants applied for interlocutory leave to appeal.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> On leave granted, the Court of Appeals affirmed the circuit court\u2019s decision in a published opinion.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Before addressing the substance of plaintiffs\u2019 claims, the Court considered whether MCL 600.2922, as amended by 2005 PA 270, applied retroactively. The Court concluded that the 2005 amendment was remedial and, thus, that the presumption that new statutes only have prospective application was inapplicable. The Court reasoned that the 2005 amendment \u201cwas enacted in order to clarify MCL 600.2922 and MCL 600.2922a and to resolve a controversy regarding their meaning.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Having concluded that the amended version of MCL 600.2922 applies retroactively, the Court then rejected defendants\u2019 position that MCL 600.2922a requires an affirmative act in order to establish a claim under the wrongful-death statute for death of a fetus. The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>Pursuant to MCL 600.2922, a party need not establish that the injury was caused by an act. Rather, MCL 600.2922 specifically provides that liability is possible when the injury is \u201ccaused by wrongful act, neglect, or fault of another . ...\u201d While MCL 600.2922 refers to a \u201cdeath as described in [MCL 600.2922a],\u201d it does not indicate that the death in question must occur in the <em>manner </em>described in MCL 600.2922a. Plaintiffs are alleging that defendants caused their injuries when they neglected to perform the requested procedure in a timely manner. That allegation, when accepted as true, sufficiently established a cause of action pursuant to MCL <em>600.2922.</em><footnotemark><em>[15]</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">The Court reasoned in the alternative that Pastorizad refusal to perform the cerclage constituted an affirmative act.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The Court also concluded that the medical provider exception of MCL 600.2922a was inapplicable because no medical procedure had been performed.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b544-7\">Defendants filed an application for leave to appeal in this Court. This Court granted leave to appeal in an order dated March 23, 2011, and directed the parties to brief \u201c(1) whether the 2005 amendment of MCL 600.2922,2005 PA 270, applies retroactively and (2) if so, whether the reference to \u2018death as described in section 2922a\u2019 in the 2005 amendment of MCL 600.2922 incorporates the exceptions to recovery contained at MCL 600.2922a(2).\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b544-8\">IV STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b544-9\">We review de novo a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion for summary disposition.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Likewise, whether a statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>applies retroactively is a question of statutory construction that this Court reviews de novo.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Questions of statutory interpretation are questions of law that are reviewed de novo.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b545-5\">V ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">A. RETROACTIVITY OF MCL 600.2922(1) AS AMENDED BY 2005 PA 270</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">Public Act 270 of 2005 took effect on December 19, 2005, and plaintiffs\u2019 cause of action arose on November 1, 2005. Plaintiffs argue that the Court of Appeals was correct in holding that 2005 PA 270 is retroactive and applicable to this case. Plaintiffs argue that the Court of Appeals correctly held that MCL 600.2922 specifically provides that liability is possible when the \u201cdeath as described in [MCL 600.2922a]\u201d is \u201ccaused by wrongful act, neglect, or fault of another.\u201d Thus, plaintiffs need not establish under MCL 600.2922, as amended by 2005 PA 270, that the injury was caused by Pastoriza\u2019s affirmative act.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">In determining whether a statute applies retroactively or prospectively, the intent of the Legislature governs.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Statutes are presumed to apply prospectively unless the Legislature clearly manifests the intent for retroactive application.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> This is \u201cespecially true when giving a statute retroactive operation will. .. create a new liability in connection with a past transaction, or invalidate a defense which was good when the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>was passed.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Further, \u201c[e]ven if the Legislature acts to invalidate a prior decision of this Court, the amendment is limited to prospective application if it enacts a substantive change in the law.\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">While 2005 PA 270 was given immediate effect, nothing in the statutory amendment suggests that the Legislature intended <em>retroactive </em>effect. The phrase \u201cimmediate effect\u201d simply refers to Const 1963, art 4, \u00a7 27, which provides that \u201c[n]o act shall take effect until the expiration of 90 days from the end of the session at which it was passed, but the legislature may give <em>immediate effect </em>to acts by a two-thirds vote of the members elected to and serving in each house.\u201d (Emphasis added.)<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Use of the phrase \u201cimmediate effect\u201d does not at all suggest that a public act applies retroactively.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">As we have noted in other cases, \u201cthe Legislature has shown . . . that it knows how to make clear its intention that a statute apply retroactively.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> In this case, that the Legislature knows how to do so is palpably demonstrated by considering a previous amendment of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>wrongful-death statute. MCL 600.2922, as amended by 1985 PA 93, was ordered to take immediate effect on the date the act was filed, July 10, 1985.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> In contrast to 2005 PA 270, however, \u00a7 2 of 1985 PA 93 expressly provided, in pertinent part, \u201cThis amendatory act applies to cases and matters pending on or filed after the effective date of this amendatory act. While the Legislature made clear its intention that 1985 PA 93 take immediate effect on the date it was filed, it also made clear that the amendatory act would be applied retroactively to cases and matters that were pending on the effective date of the amendatory act. We will not ignore that the Legislature did not include language making MCL 600.2922, as amended by 2005 PA 270, retroactive given that a previous amendment of MCL 600.2922 was specifically made retroactive.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> The Legislature was cognizant of the operative language necessary to apply any particular provision in the amendatory act retroactively but did not include such language in 2005 PA 270.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals improperly held that \u201cMCL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>600.2922, as amended by 2005 PA 270, . . . may be applied retroactively from April 1, 2000, the effective date of the last prior amendment of MCL 600.2922 before its amendment in 2005.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Had the Legislature intended that 2005 PA 270 apply retroactively, the Legislature could readily have provided that \u201c[t]his amendatory act applies to a cause of action arising on or after April 1, 2000.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">This Court has recognized that \u201cproviding a specific, future effective date and omitting any reference to retroactivity supports a conclusion that a statute should be applied prospectively only.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> This is akin to what the 2005 amendment of the wrongful-death statute does: it provides a specific effective date, that being the date of filing with the Secretary of State, without the slightest hint of retroactive application. The amendment contains no language suggesting that it applies to an antecedent \u201cdeath as described in section 2922a.\u201d Therefore, the amended language applies only to injuries occurring on or after the effective date of 2005 PA 270, December 19, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">Acknowledging the absence of statutory language expressing legislative intent to apply the statute retroactively, both plaintiffs and the Court of Appeals\u2019 opinion rely on an \u201cexception\u201d to the presumption that statutes apply prospectively: that \u201cstatutes which operate in furtherance of a remedy or mode of procedure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>and which neither create new rights nor destroy, enlarge, or diminish existing rights are generally held to operate retrospectively unless a contrary legislative intent is manifested.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> Simply calling a statute \u201cremedial,\u201d however, is not enough for retroactive application, as we explained in <em>Lynch:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-5\">[W]e have rejected the notion that a statute significantly affecting a party\u2019s substantive rights should be applied retroactively merely because it can also be characterized in a sense as \u201cremedial.\u201d In that regard, we agree with Chief Justice Riley\u2019s plurality opinion in <em>White v General Motors Corp, </em>that the term \u201cremedial\u201d in this context should <em>only be employed to describe legislation that does not affect substantive rights. </em>Otherwise, the mere fact that a statute is characterized as remedial is of little value in statutory construction. Again, the question is one of legislative intent.<footnotemark>[35]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">This exception to the presumption of prospective application for remedial statutes is inapplicable here because the statutory amendment affects substantive rights. Before the 2005 amendment of the wrongful-death statute, a plaintiff could not bring an action under MCL 600.2922 for the death of a nonviable fetus. Nothing in the language of either MCL 600.2922 or MCL 600.2922a indicated that the death of a nonviable fetus could be redressed under \u00a7 2922. Under MCL 600.2922, as amended by 2005 PA 270, the representative of the fetus\u2019s estate is now able to file a wrongful-death claim on the basis of the fetus\u2019s death.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Addition<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>ally, MCL 600.2922, as amended by 2005 PA 270, permits plaintiffs to bring claims, as the result of the death of a nonviable fetus, for loss of consortium and other damages unique to the wrongful-death statute that plaintiffs would not otherwise be entitled to bring.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> The 2005 amendment thus affects the substantive rights of those who would harm or kill a nonviable fetus, as well as the substantive rights of those who bring claims on behalf of a fetus\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">Given these considerations, we conclude that the 2005 amendment of MCL 600.2922 does not apply retroactively.

The term \u201cact\u201d commonly means \u201canything done, being done, or to be done[.]\u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> The phrases \u201cwrongful act\u201d and \u201cnegligent act\u201d also have plain legal connotations. According to Black\u2019s Law Dictionary, the phrase \u201cwrongful act\u201d is synonymous with the phrase \u201cwrongful conduct,\u201d which means \u201c[a]n act taken in violation of a legal duty; an act that unjustly infringes on another\u2019s rights.\u201d<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> And Black\u2019s Law Dictionary defines \u201cnegligent act\u201d as an \u201cact that creates an unreasonable risk of harm to another.\u201d<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> Further, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary compares the phrase, \u201cactive negligence,\u201d with the phrase \u201cpassive negligence.\u201d The former means \u201c[njegligence resulting from <em>an affirmative or positive act, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>such as driving through a barrier.\u201d<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> On the other hand, \u201cpassive negligence\u201d means \u201c[n]egligence resulting from a person\u2019s failure or omission in acting, such as failing to remove hazardous conditions from public property.\u201d<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> The Legislature clearly intended to impose liability for affirmative or positive acts under MCL 600.2922a(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">In comparison, it is very clear that the Legislature did not intend to impose liability for omissions, something it can and has done in other statutes.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> The Legislature did not even include the more expansive terms \u201cneglect\u201d and \u201cfault of another\u201d that it included in MCL 600.2922(1), which permit liability on the basis of omissions. The Legislature\u2019s decision to exclude omissions from MCL 600.2922a indicates that it did not intend to attach liability to omissions that cause prenatal death or injury. To read the phrase \u201cwrongful or negligent act\u201d as including omissions would expand liability under MCL 600.2922a beyond the Legislature\u2019s intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-6\">In addition, MCL 600.2922a exempts healthcare professionals from liability for medical procedures performed either with consent or under emergency circumstances, and from liability for lawfully dispensing and prescribing medication. It would be incongruous to read the statute as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>providing liability for negligent omissions when it specifically exempts healthcare professionals from liability for their affirmative acts of commission performed within the scope of their practice under MCL 600.2922a(2)(b). Because the statute specifically requires a wrongful or negligent act, a wrongful or negligent omission does not impose liability under the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-4\">In <em>People v Thomas,</em><footnotemark><em>52</em></footnotemark><em> </em>this Court similarly distinguished between the omission of a duty and an affirmative act. In <em>Thomas, </em>a police officer was charged with crimes related to his falsification of a police report, including common-law obstruction of justice, MCL 750.505. The question presented was whether the trial court erred by dismissing the obstruction of justice charge because the alleged conduct fell within the statutory prohibition of failing to uphold the law, MCL 752.11.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> The relevant statute, MCL 752.11, provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b554-5\">Any public official, appointed or elected, who is responsible for enforcing or upholding any law of this state and who wilfully and knowingly fails to uphold or enforce the law with the result that any person\u2019s legal rights are denied is guilty of a misdemeanor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b554-6\">Just as in this case, the <em>Thomas </em>Court found it necessary when reading the relevant statute to \u201cdistinguish between the omission of a duty and affirmative acts.\u201d<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> We concluded that MCL 752.11 \u201cproscribes the wilful and knowing <em>failure </em>to uphold the law, <em>acts of omission.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>55</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We also unanimously concluded that falsifying a police report is clearly an act of commission, not an act of omission.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>Under the analytical framework laid out in Thomas, even assuming that defendant \u201crefused\u201d to perform a procedure,<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> his refusal still could not be characterized as anything other than \u201cwilful and knowing failure to [do something],\u201d language which this Court in <em>Thomas </em>unequivocally construed as an act of omission.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">Moreover, we cannot accept the dissent\u2019s conclusion \u201cthat an active decision-making process clearly involves an affirmative act.\u201d<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> This conclusion morphs all willful omissions into commissions. And even assuming that Pastoriza did refuse to perform a cerclage, his words of refusal did not create any risk of harm. Rather, as plaintiffs claim, it was Pastoriza\u2019s failure to perform a medical procedure that caused the harm, and this alleged <em>failure </em>cannot be reasonably characterized as an affirmative act. The dissent\u2019s conclusion that Pastoriza committed an \u201cact\u201d when he \u201crefused to act\u201d is untenable. A refusal to act is to abstain from action and, therefore, cannot reasonably be considered an act. In sum, the dissent distorts the express language of MCL 600.2922a, obliterates the long-recognized distinction between the omission of a duty and affirmative acts, and improperly equates saying \u201cno\u201d with an affirmative act.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">Viewing the pleadings in a light most favorable to plaintiff and accepting each and every factual allegation as true, Pastoriza\u2019s act was, at most, an omission. Consequently, plaintiffs have failed to state a claim <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>under MCL 600.2922a because defendants did not commit a \u201cwrongful or negligent act.\u201d Therefore, the trial court erred by denying summary disposition to defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">VI. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">In sum, we hold that the 2005 amendment of MCL 600.2922(1) does not have retroactive application because (1) the Legislature failed to give any indication that retroactive application was intended, and (2) the amendment affects substantive rights and cannot be given retroactive application on the ground that it is remedial. Therefore, plaintiffs may not proceed under MCL 600.2922. Further, we hold that the text of MCL 600.2922a provides liability only for affirmative acts and does not encompass omissions. In this case, plaintiffs have only alleged an omission or failure to act by defendants; therefore, plaintiffs have failed to state a claim under MCL 600.2922a. We therefore reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case to the trial court for the entry of partial summary disposition in favor of defendants.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark></p>\n<judges id=\"b556-7\">Young, C.

At issue is the extent of liability imposed under two statutes, MCL 600.2922a and MCL 600.2922, for wrongful or negligent acts against a pregnant woman that result in injuries to or the death of a fetus. The majority holds that plaintiffs\u2019 claims for negligence brought under MCL 600.2922a, which provides a cause of action for injuries to or the death of a fetus, fail as a matter of law. The majority believes that MCL 600.2922a only imposes liability for negligent conduct when the conduct complained of consists of an \u201caffirmative\u201d act rather than an \u201comission.\u201d The majority further holds that claims brought under the wrongful-death statute, MCL 600.2922, as amended by 2005 PA 270, fail because the majority believes that the 2005 amendment of the statute, incorporating the death of a fetus, is not retroactive. Because I find both of these conclusions erroneous, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">The underlying claims in this case involve allegations of negligence resulting in the death of plaintiff Baby Johnson,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> as well as injuries to his mother, plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>Candice Johnson. Ms. Johnson had a history of miscarriages resulting from a condition known as an incompetent cervix. Treatment for this condition includes placement of a cerclage, which involves suturing the lower end of the uterus to strengthen it and prevent miscarriages. Ms. Johnson had multiple previous pregnancies, and in each pregnancy in which a cerclage was not placed, she miscarried; however, in her last three pregnancies, a cerclage was used, and she was able to carry her children to full-term. Defendant Rajan Pastoriza, M.D.,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> was briefly involved in Ms. Johnson\u2019s last pregnancy and had removed the cerclage before the successful birth of her last full-term child.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-4\">Ms. Johnson became pregnant with Baby Johnson in June 2005 and chose defendant as her obstetrician. In September 2005, Ms. Johnson began bleeding vaginally and went to Foote Hospital, where she was advised to follow up with defendant. Defendant failed to place a cerclage during that follow-up visit. Ms. Johnson continued treatment with defendant as instructed, but he never placed a cerclage, despite ultrasound findings that Baby Johnson was the appropriate gestational age for placement of a cerclage. On October 19, 2005, Ms. Johnson complained to defendant that she felt preterm labor-like cramping. On this occasion, she specifically asked defendant to place a cerclage, but he refused to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-5\">On November 1, 2005, Ms. Johnson went into premature labor. She was transferred to Sparrow Hospital where an emergency cerclage was placed. However, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>cerclage failed to prevent the miscarriage. Baby Johnson was delivered at 20 weeks\u2019 gestation and did not survive. Plaintiffs alleged that the cerclage was placed too late to be effective in preventing the miscarriage and that Baby Johnson died as a result of defendant\u2019s refusal to place the cerclage at an earlier time. Ms. Johnson also alleged that the failed emergency cerclage caused a significant and permanent cervical tear that will prevent her from having any more children.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">Only counts II and III of plaintiffs\u2019 third amended complaint are at issue in this appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Count II, brought by Ms. Johnson, is based on MCL 600.2922a, which provides for liability for injuries to or the death of a fetus caused by a wrongful or negligent act against a pregnant individual. Count III, on behalf of Baby Johnson, was brought under MCL 600.2922a and the wrongful-death statute, MCL 600.2922. The trial court denied defendant\u2019s motions for summary disposition, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. I believe that the trial court and the Court of Appeals reached the correct result with respect to both of these issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">With regard to the claims brought under MCL 600.2922a, the majority opines that those claims fail as a matter of law because it believes that this statute only imposes liability for negligent or wrongful conduct consisting of an <em>affirmative act, </em>rather than an <em>omission. </em>I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the conduct complained of in this case was an omission. Instead, defendant\u2019s conduct involved affirmative acts. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>As such, it is unnecessary to reach the issue whether liability can be based on an omission under this statute.</p>\n<p id=\"A16\">MCL 600.2922a(l) provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b560-4\">A person who commits a wrongful or negligent act against a pregnant individual is liable for damages if the act results in a miscarriage or stillbirth by that individual, or physical injury to or the death of the embryo or fetus.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">According to the plain language of this subsection, the relevant inquiry is whether a person has committed a wrongful or negligent act against a pregnant individual. This case involves conduct, consisting of medical treatment by a physician, which is alleged to be \u201cwrongful\u201d or \u201cnegligent.\u201d The specific allegation is that Ms. Johnson needed a cerclage, defendant was aware of her need for the procedure, and he made a conscious decision not to perform that treatment. On one occasion, after having been asked to place the cerclage, defendant specifically refused to perform the procedure. Thus, the salient question is whether a defendant\u2019s active decision-making process in refusing to perform a necessary and specifically requested medical procedure is properly characterized as an omission or whether it is, in fact, an affirmative act. I believe that an active decision-making process clearly involves an affirmative act.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">To hold otherwise ignores the language of the statute and the obvious intent of the Legislature. MCL 600.2922a imposes liability when a person \u201ccommits a wrongful or negligent act. . . .\u201d This defendant committed \u201can act\u201d when he consciously and actively refused to perform the procedure. An active, conscious decision is not an omission. Thus, I agree with the Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion that \u201c[i]t is improper in this instance to classify defendants\u2019 alleged conduct as an omission\u201d and that \u201cconduct in denying the requested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>care is tantamount to an affirmative act.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, I believe that plaintiffs\u2019 claims under MCL 600.2922a may proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">The majority also addresses the claims brought under the wrongful-death statute on behalf of the estate of Baby Johnson. The relevant portion of the wrongful-death statute, MCL 600.2922(1), as amended by 2005 PA 270, currently provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-5\">Whenever the death of a person, injuries resulting in death, <em>or death as described in section 2922a </em>shall be caused by wrongful act, neglect, or fault of another, and the act, neglect, or fault is such as would, if death had not ensued, have entitled the party injured to maintain an action and recover damages, the person who or the corporation that would have been liable, if death had not ensued, shall be liable to an action for damages, notwithstanding the death of the person injured or <em>death as described in section 2922a, </em>and although the death was caused under circumstances that constitute a felony. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">At the time of the alleged negligence, MCL 600.2922(1) did not include the language regarding \u201cdeath as described in section 2922a,\u201d which is now twice cross-referenced in this subsection. This amendatory language was added in 2005 to specifically incorporate fetal deaths into the purview of actionable claims that can be pursued under the wrongful-death statute. The effective date of the amendatory act was in December 2005, the month following the death of Baby Johnson. The majority opines that because the negligent acts complained of occurred before the effective date of the amendatory act, the claims for Baby Johnson must fail because the amendatory act was not retroactive. I disagree. I believe that the Court of Appeals correctly analyzed this issue and properly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>found that the amended version <em>of </em>the wrongful-death statute applies retroactively.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">To determine whether a statute should be applied prospectively or retroactively, the primary rule is that the intent of the Legislature controls, and all other rules of construction are subservient to this rule. <em>Frank W Lynch &amp; Co v Flex Technologies, </em>Inc, 463 Mich 578, 583; 624 NW2d 180 (2001). Generally, statutes are presumed to operate prospectively unless a contrary intent is expressed. <em>Id. </em>However, there is a long-recognized exception when a statute is deemed remedial or procedural in nature. <em>Hansen-Snyder Co v Gen Motors Corp, </em>371 Mich 480, 484-485; 124 NW2d 286 (1963). \u201cStatutes which operate in furtherance of a remedy already existing and which neither create new rights nor destroy existing rights are held to operate retrospectively, unless a contrary legislative intention is manifested.\u201d <em>Selk v Detroit Plastic Prod, </em>419 Mich 1, 10; 345 NW2d 184 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">The 2005 amendment of MCL 600.2922(1) incorporated fetal deaths, as described in MCL 600.2922a, into the purview of the wrongful-death statute. By amending MCL 600.2922(1), the Legislature did not create a new right because the right to bring a cause of action based on wrongful or negligent acts that resulted in the death of a fetus already existed under MCL 600.2922a. This clearly delineated statutory right contained in MCL 600.2922a was seemingly disregarded or at least overlooked in <em>McClain v Univ of Mich Bd of Regents, </em>256 Mich App 492; 665 NW2d 484 (2003). <em>McClain </em>held that an action for wrongful death could not be brought on behalf of a nonviable fetus. The Court opined that because a nonviable fetus is not a \u201cperson\u201d within the meaning of the wrongful-death statute, such an action could not proceed. <em>Id. </em>at 495. However, <em>McClain </em>failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>to address or acknowledge the rights embodied in MCL 600.2922a, which permits a cause of action for injuries to or the death of a fetus irrespective of whether the fetus was viable. In doing so, <em>McClain </em>effectively abrogated the rights given to nonviable fetuses in MCL 600.2922a. Thus, it appears that the purpose of the 2005 amendment was merely to clarify the legislative intent that a cause of action could be brought on behalf of a nonviable fetus.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">This conclusion is buttressed by the following legislative history<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> from the House Fiscal Agency\u2019s analysis of the amendatory act:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-5\">Prior to 1998, the Michigan law did not specifically speak to the right of an individual to sue if the death in question was that of the unborn. Historically, lawsuits through the years went back and forth, sometimes applying regardless of gestational age, then more recently, being limited to instances in which the fetus was viable. Legislation in 1998 sought to settle the question by establishing both civil liability and criminal penalties for conduct against a pregnant woman that caused a miscarriage or stillbirth or that caused physical injury to the embryo or fetus (Public Act 211 \u2014 civil and Public Act 238 \u2014 criminal).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-6\">The language establishing the civil penalty was placed in a separate section (MCL 600.2922a) from the existing wrongful death provision (MCL 600.2922) as a compromise between pro-life and pro-choice advocates. Since Section 2922 specifies a right to recover damages for the wrongful death of a \u201cperson,\u201d pro-choice advocates voiced a concern that including conduct against a pregnant woman in that section would, by association, attach \u201cpersonhood\u201d to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>fetus or embryo and subsequently could be used to attack laws protecting reproductive rights.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-6\">Many thought the 1998 legislation was clear, but a 2000 Oakland County case proved otherwise. The Oakland County Circuit Court ruled that a man who had killed his pregnant wife could not be charged with the death of his wife\u2019s embryo because his actions did not \u201ctechnically\u201d result in either a miscarriage or a stillbirth as the embryo was not expelled from the wife\u2019s body. As a result, Public Act 2 of 2001 and Public Act 164 of 2002 were enacted to amend the Michigan Penal Code and the wrongful death statute, respectively, to extend the criminal and civil penalties to conduct causing the death of an embryo or fetus. It was believed at the time that Public Act 164 closed the loophole in the wrongful death statute and so would apply to all situations in which conduct toward a pregnant woman resulted in the death of the embryo or fetus she carried.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-7\">However, in subsequent civil actions, courts around the state have apparently only looked at Section 2922 of the wrongful death statute and not Section 2922a. Most notably, in <em>McClain </em>v <em>University of Michigan Board of Regents, </em>256 Mich App 492 (2003), the court held that \u201cunder Michigan law, an action for wrongful death, MCL 600.2922, cannot be brought on behalf of a nonviable fetus, because a nonviable fetus is not a \u2018person\u2019 within the meaning of the wrongful-death act.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b564-8\">\n<em>Once again, it has become clear that legislation is needed to clarify the legislature\u2019s intent of providing a cause of action for the wrongful death of not only a person, but also an embryo or fetusS</em>\n<footnotemark>\n<em>[6]</em>\n</footnotemark>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-9\">These comments make clear that this amendment was intended to clarify that claims for the wrongful death of a nonviable fetus may be pursued under the wrongful-death statute. The amendatory act did not establish any new rights because the right to pursue an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>action for the death of a fetus already existed under MCL 600.2922a. The 2005 amendment of the wrongful-death statute was only adopted to resolve the confusion created by <em>McClain </em>regarding whether a claim may be brought for the death of a nonviable fetus.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-4\">Thus, I agree with the Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion that \u201cit is clear that MCL 600.2922 was amended to add the language \u2018or death as described in section 2922a\u2019 in order to clarify both MCL 600.2922 and MCL 600.2922a and to resolve a controversy regarding their meaning.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Under these circumstances, I am persuaded that the Legislature intended the amended version of the wrongful-death statute to apply retroactively. As such, Baby Johnson\u2019s estate, as a matter of law, is entitled to proceed with its wrongful-death claim. Whether plaintiffs\u2019 allegations will ultimately prevail on the merits involves issues to be resolved by a jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b565-5\">Therefore, I believe that the trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motions for summary disposition was proper. I would affirm the Court of Appeals. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b557-7\"> This action was originally filed in the name of two plaintiffs, Baby Johnson and Candice Johnson. The complaint was subsequently amended, identifying the decedent, Baby Johnson, as Ordane Michael Johnson, and adding a count on behalf of the estate of Ordane Michael Johnson. To avoid confusion, I refer to the decedent as Baby Johnson.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b558-6\"> Plaintiffs brought suit against Rajan Pastoriza, M.D., in his individual capacity and against his professional corporation.
