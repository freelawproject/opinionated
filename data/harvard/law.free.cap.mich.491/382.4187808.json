The Court of Appeals erred by reaching the opposite conclusion in <em>People v King</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and we therefore reverse the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment in <em>King.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">Further, to establish the affirmative defense under \u00a7 8, we hold that a defendant must show under \u00a7 8(a)(1) that the physician\u2019s statement was made after enactment of the MMMA but before commission of the offense. The Court of Appeals reached this conclusion in <em>People v </em>Kolanek,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and we affirm the Court of Appeals in this regard. However, the Court of Appeals also held that defendant could reassert the affirmative defense at trial, despite his failure at the evidentiary hearing to establish the existence of a timely physician\u2019s statement under \u00a7 8(a)(1). This was error, and we reverse that portion of the Court of Appeals\u2019 holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"A_K\">A. <em>PEOPLE v KING</em></p>\n<p id=\"b503-7\">In May 2009, police officers received an anonymous tip that marijuana was growing in the backyard of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>defendant Larry King\u2019s home in Owosso, Michigan. The officers went to the residence and observed, from a neighbor\u2019s driveway, marijuana plants growing inside a chain-link dog kennel that was wrapped on three sides with a plastic tarp. The officers then spoke with King, who showed them his \u201cregistry identification card\u201d for medical use of marijuana that had been issued April 20, 2009. The officers asked to see the marijuana plants, and King consented. Using a key, he unlocked the padlock on the kennel. Inside the kennel were six marijuana plants. The kennel was six feet tall, was not anchored to the ground, and was open on top.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-5\">The officers then obtained a search warrant for King\u2019s home. Inside, the officers discovered six marijuana plants in his living-room closet, which did not have a lock on it. The back door to the home also lacked a lock. In addition to the live plants, the officers also found processed marijuana in two prescription bottles; several plastic bags containing marijuana stalks, buds, and leaves; two additional dead marijuana plants; and a food dehydrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b504-6\">King was arrested and charged with one count of manufacturing marijuana.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> At the preliminary examination in the district court, he moved to dismiss the charge under \u00a7 8 of the MMMA.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The court denied King\u2019s motion and bound him over on the charge.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b504-7\">King renewed his motion to dismiss in the circuit court, again asserting that he had established the elements of the affirmative defense under \u00a7 8. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>prosecutor responded that because King had failed to comply with \u00a7 4(a) by not keeping his marijuana in an \u201cenclosed, locked facility,\u201d King could not establish the elements of the affirmative defense under \u00a7 8. The circuit court disagreed with the prosecutor that King was not in compliance with \u00a7 4(a), ruling instead that King had satisfied the requirements of \u00a7 4 because he was a qualifying patient with a valid registry identification card; possessed no more than 12 plants in an enclosed, locked facility; and was entitled to the presumption that he was engaged in the medical use of marijuana. The circuit court further reasoned that King, in accordance with \u00a7 8, had obtained a valid physician\u2019s statement, possessed a reasonably necessary amount of marijuana consistently with \u00a7 4, and was engaged in the use and possession of marijuana to treat a serious medical condition. The circuit court therefore ruled that King\u2019s use of marijuana was \u201cin accordance with [the MMMA]\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and that King was entitled to dismissal of the charge under \u00a7 8.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b505-5\">The Court of Appeals reversed. The Court of Appeals held that the \u201cexpress reference\u201d in \u00a7 8 \u201cto \u00a7 7 [MCL 333.26427] and the statement in \u00a7 7(a) that medical use of marijuana must be carried out in accordance with the provisions of the MMMA require [King] to comply with the provisions of \u00a7 4 concerning growing marijuana.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Applying its interpretation of the statute, the Court of Appeals concluded that because King had failed to keep the plants in an \u201c \u2018enclosed, locked facility,\u2019 \u201d he had not complied with \u00a7 4(a). As a consequence, the Court held that he also failed to meet the requirements for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>affirmative defense in \u00a7 8.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals reversed the circuit court and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">We granted leave to consider, in relevant part, \u201cwhether the language \u2018[e]xcept as provided in section <em>T </em>in \u00a7 8(a) required the defendant to fulfill all of the conditions set forth in \u00a7 4 in order to have a valid affirmative defense under \u00a7 8(a).\u201d <footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">B. <em>PEOPLE v KOLANEK</em></p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">On April 6, 2009, police arrested defendant Alexander Kolanek for the possession of eight marijuana cigarettes. Kolanek did not have a registry identification card at the time of his arrest. The next day, the prosecution charged Kolanek with possession of marijuana.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b506-8\">Six days later, on April 12, 2009, Kolanek requested that his physician of nine years, Dr. Ray Breitenbach, authorize his medical use of marijuana to treat chronic severe pain and nausea caused by Lyme disease. Breitenbach complied with this request on the basis of his professional opinion that Kolanek would receive a therapeutic benefit from using marijuana. The same day, Kolanek applied for a registry identification card. The Michigan Department of Community Health issued him a card two weeks later on May 1, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-9\">On June 9, 2009, Kolanek moved to dismiss the criminal charge pending against him, asserting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>affirmative defense in \u00a7 8 of the MMMA. The district court held an evidentiary hearing on the motion, at which Breitenbach testified that Kolanek would have been eligible for the medical use of marijuana on the date of his arrest. However, despite having discussed Kolanek\u2019s potential medical use of marijuana on July 14, 2008, before the enactment of the MMMA, Breitenbach testified that he did not provide Kolanek with authorization to use marijuana until April 12, 2009, six days after the date of Kolanek\u2019s arrest.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">The district court rejected the prosecutor\u2019s argument that Kolanek must have had a valid registry identification card to assert a \u00a7 8 defense, but nonetheless denied Kolanek\u2019s motion to dismiss. The court reasoned that the language \u201chas stated\u201d in \u00a7 8(a)(1) contemplates a physician\u2019s statement made before commission of the offense. Because Kolanek had not obtained such a statement, the court concluded that Kolanek had failed to meet his burden under \u00a7 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">Kolanek appealed in the circuit court, which reversed the district court\u2019s ruling. In the circuit court\u2019s view, the district court\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 8(a)(1) was erroneous. Section 8(a)(1), according to the circuit court, \u201cdoes not require the physician have stated [sic] this before the defendant\u2019s arrest. It merely requires that the physician has stated it. In this case, the physician stated it at the hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">The Court of Appeals reversed the circuit court. Like the district court, the panel rejected the prosecution\u2019s argument that Kolanek had to meet the registry-card requirement of \u00a7 4 in order to assert a valid defense <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>under \u00a7 8.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals also concluded that Kolanek had not produced sufficient evidence of the \u00a7 8 affirmative defense.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals reasoned, like the district court, that the phrase \u201chas stated\u201d in \u00a7 8(a)(1) contemplates a physician\u2019s statement made after enactment of the MMMA but before the offense occurs.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> It reversed the circuit court\u2019s decision and remanded for reinstatement of the charge.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In doing so, the Court provided directions on remand:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b508-3\">Because the statute does not provide that the failure to bring, or to win, a pretrial motion to dismiss deprives the defendant of the statutory defense before the factfinder, [Kolanek\u2019s] failure to provide sufficient proofs pursuant to his motion to dismiss does not bar him from asserting the \u00a7 8 defense at trial or from submitting additional proofs in support of the defense at that time.<footnotemark>[18]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">We granted Kolanek\u2019s application for leave to appeal to consider \u201cwhether, in order to have a valid affirmative defense for the medical use of marijuana under MCL 333.26428(a)(1), a defendant must obtain the required physician\u2019s statement after the date of enactment of the [MMMA], but before the date of the defendant\u2019s arrest.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We also granted the prosecution\u2019s application for leave to appeal to consider \u201cwhether a defendant may assert the affirmative defense under MCL 333.26428(a) as a defense at trial after a court has denied the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss under MCL 333.26428(b)\u201d and also the issue raised in <em>King </em>regarding whether a defendant must satisfy \u00a7 4 to have a valid <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>\u00a7 8 defense.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">These cases present issues of statutory interpretation. We review questions of statutory interpretation de novo.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">A. THE MICHIGAN MEDICAL MARIHUANA ACT</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">The MMMA was proposed in a citizen\u2019s initiative petition, was elector-approved in November 2008, and became effective December 4, 2008.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The purpose of the MMMA is to allow a limited class of individuals the medical use of marijuana, and the act declares this pur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>pose to be an \u201ceffort for the health and welfare of [Michigan] citizens.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> To meet this end, the MMMA defines the parameters of legal medical-marijuana use, promulgates a scheme for regulating registered patient use and administering the act, and provides for an affirmative defense, as well as penalties for violating the MMMA.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">The MMMA does <em>not </em>create a general right for individuals to use and possess marijuana in Michigan. Possession, manufacture, and delivery of marijuana remain punishable offenses under Michigan law.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Rather, the MMMA\u2019s protections are limited to individuals suffering from serious or debilitating medical conditions or symptoms, to the extent that the individuals\u2019 marijuana use \u201cis carried out in accordance with the provisions of [the MMMA].\u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">The cases before us involve two sections of the MMMA that provide separate protections from prosecution for offenses involving marijuana. The first, \u00a7 4, MCL 333.26424, grants \u201cqualifying patient[s]\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> who hold \u201creg<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>istry identification card[s]\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> broad immunity from criminal prosecution, civil penalties, and disciplinary actions, and provides in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b511-5\">A qualifying patient who has been issued and possesses a registry identification card shall not be subject to arrest, prosecution, or penalty in any manner, or denied any right or privilege, including but not limited to civil penalty or disciplinary action by a business or occupational or professional licensing board or bureau, for the medical use of marihuana<footnotemark>[28]</footnotemark> in accordance with this act, provided that the qualifying patient possesses an amount of marihuana that does not exceed 2.5 ounces of usable marihuana, and, if the qualifying patient has not specified that a primary caregiver will be allowed under state law to cultivate marihuana for the qualifying patient, 12 marihuana plants kept in an enclosed, locked facility. Any incidental amount of seeds, stalks, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>unusable roots shall also be allowed under state law and shall not be included in this amount<footnotemark>[29]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">The second provision, \u00a7 8, MCL 333.26428, applies to \u201cpatients\u201d generally, provides an affirmative defense to charges involving marijuana for its medical use, and states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-6\">(a) Except as provided in [MCL 333.26427], a patient and a patient\u2019s primary caregiver, if any, may assert the medical purpose for using marihuana as a defense to any prosecution involving marihuana, and this defense shall be presumed valid where the evidence shows that:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-7\">(1) A physician has stated that, in the physician\u2019s professional opinion, after having completed a full assessment of the patient\u2019s medical history and current medical condition made in the course of a bona fide physician-patient relationship<footnotemark>[30]</footnotemark>the patient is likely to receive therapeutic or palliative benefit from the medical use of marihuana to treat or alleviate the patient\u2019s serious or debilitating medical condition or symptoms of the patient\u2019s serious or debilitating medical condition;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-8\">(2) The patient and the patient\u2019s primary caregiver, if any, were collectively in possession of a quantity of marihuana that was not more than was reasonably necessary to ensure the uninterrupted availability of marihuana for the purpose of treating or alleviating the patient\u2019s serious or debilitating medical condition or symptoms of the patient\u2019s serious or debilitating medical condition; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-9\">(3) The patient and the patient\u2019s primary caregiver, if any, were engaged in the acquisition, possession, cultiva<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>tion, manufacture, use, delivery, transfer, or transportation of marihuana or paraphernalia relating to the use of marihuana to treat or alleviate the patient\u2019s serious or debilitating medical condition or symptoms of the patient\u2019s serious or debilitating medical condition.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-5\">(b) A person may assert the medical purpose for using marihuana in a motion to dismiss, and the charges shall be dismissed following an evidentiary hearing where the person shows the elements listed in subsection (a).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-6\">(c) If a patient or a patient\u2019s primary caregiver demonstrates the patient\u2019s medical purpose for using marihuana pursuant to this section, the patient and the patient\u2019s primary caregiver shall not be subject to the following for the patient\u2019s medical use of marihuana:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-7\">(1) disciplinary action by a business or occupational or professional licensing board or bureau; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b513-8\">(2) forfeiture of any interest in or right to property.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">Our consideration of the availability of the affirmative defense in \u00a7 8 and the immunity conferred under \u00a7 4 is guided by the traditional principles of statutory construction. However, because the MMMA was the result of a voter initiative, our goal is to ascertain and give effect to the intent of the electorate, rather than the Legislature, as reflected in the language of the law itself.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> We must give the words of the MMMA their ordinary and plain meaning as would have been understood by the electorate.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b513-10\">Clearly, \u00a7 4 applies only to \u201cqualifying patients\u201d who have obtained registry cards. Under this section, those patients are provided broad immunity from \u201carrest, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>prosecution, or penalty in any manner\u201d and protection from the denial of \u201cany right or privilege, including but not limited to civil penalty or disciplinary action by a business or occupational or professional licensing board or bureau,\u201d provided that these patients possess not more than 2.5 ounces of usable marijuana and 12 marijuana plants kept in \u201can enclosed, locked facility.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Additional protections in \u00a7 4 prohibit the denial of custody or visitation with a minor based on the medical use of marijuana in accordance with the MMMA<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> and provide a presumption that registered cardholders possessing an appropriate amount of marijuana are engaged in the medical use of marijuana.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">Comparatively, \u00a7 8 provides an affirmative defense to \u201cpatients\u201d or \u201ca person\u201d generally.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> As the prosecution in both cases concedes, the language of \u00a7 8 permits those individuals who are not registered cardholding patients to assert the \u00a7 8 affirmative defense.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Under \u00a7 8, a patient in any criminal prosecution involving marijuana may establish an affirmative defense requiring dismissal of the charges if the patient can establish that (1) \u201c[a] physician has stated that, in the physician\u2019s professional opinion, after having completed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>full assessment of the patient\u2019s medical history and current medical condition made in the course of a bona fide physician-patient relationship, the patient is likely to receive therapeutic or palliative benefit from the medical use of marihuana,\u201d (2) the patient did not possess an amount of marijuana that was more than \u201creasonably necessary\u201d for this purpose, and (3) the patient\u2019s use was \u201cto treat or alleviate the patient\u2019s serious or debilitating medical condition or symptoms . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> The protections afforded a patient under \u00a7 8 are much less broad than those provided under \u00a7 <em>4 </em>and extend only to prosecutions involving marijuana, disciplinary actions by a business or occupational or professional licensing board or bureau, and forfeiture of any interest in or right to property.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">B. REQUIREMENTS OF THE \u00a7 8 AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">The facts of <em>King </em>and <em>Kolanek </em>require us to consider whether a defendant must satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 4 in order to have a valid defense under \u00a7 8. The prosecution argues that the language \u201cexcept as provided by section 7\u201d in \u00a7 8(a) incorporates the requirements of \u00a7 4, so that a defendant must establish under \u00a7 8 that he did not possess more than 2.5 ounces of usable marijuana and did not possess more than 12 plants contained in an \u201cenclosed, locked facility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">The relevant language of \u00a7 8 provides, <em>\u201cExcept as provided in section </em>7, a patient and a patient\u2019s primary caregiver, if any, may assert <em>the medical purpose for using marihuana </em>as a defense to any prosecution involving marihuana. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Section 7 provides a list of places where and situations in which the MMMA pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>hibits a person from using or possessing marijuana. Specifically, it states, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-5\">(a) The <em>medical use of marihuana </em>is allowed under state law <em>to the extent that it is carried out in accordance with the provisions of this act.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-6\">(b) <em>This act shall not permit </em>any person to do any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-7\">(1) Undertake any task under the influence of marihuana, when doing so would constitute negligence or professional malpractice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-8\">(2) Possess marihuana, or otherwise engage in the medical use of marihuana:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-9\">(A) in a school bus;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-10\">(B) on the grounds of any preschool or primary or secondary school; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-11\">(C) in any correctional facility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-12\">(3) Smoke marihuana:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-13\">(A) on any form of public transportation; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-14\">(B) in any public place.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-15\">(4) Operate, navigate, or be in actual physical control of any motor vehicle, aircraft, or motorboat while under the influence of marihuana.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-16\">(5) Use marihuana if that person does not have a serious or debilitating medical condition.<footnotemark>[40]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b516-17\">Reading \u00a7\u00a7 7 and 8 together, it is clear that even if a defendant can establish the elements of the affirmative defense under \u00a7 8, the defendant will not be entitled to dismissal under \u00a7 8 if the possession or medical use of marijuana at issue was in a manner or place prohibited under \u00a7 7(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b516-18\">Under the Court of Appeals\u2019 construction, which the prosecution urges that we adopt, the phrase \u201cin accor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>dance with the provisions of this act\u201d in \u00a7 7(a) requires a defendant to satisfy all the requirements of \u00a7 4 in order to establish the \u00a7 8 affirmative defense. Principles of statutory construction, however, do not support this conclusion. Nowhere does \u00a7 8 state that a defendant must also establish the requirements of \u00a7 4 in order to present a valid affirmative defense under \u00a7 8. Precisely because such a requirement is lacking, assertion of the \u00a7 8 defense without establishment of the \u00a7 4 requirements is \u201cin accordance with the provisions of [the MMMA].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b517-5\">The textual distinctions among \u00a7\u00a7 4, 7(a), and 8 provide further support for our interpretation that the plain language of \u00a7 8 does not require compliance with the requirements of \u00a7 4. Sections 4 and 8 provide separate and distinct protections and require different showings, while \u00a7 7(a), by its plain terms, does not incorporate \u00a7 4 into \u00a7 8.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Both \u00a7\u00a7 4 and 7(a) refer to the \u201cmedical use\u201d of marijuana, which the MMMA specifically defines as the use of marijuana \u201cto treat or alleviate a <em>registered qualifying patient\u2019s </em>debilitating medical condition or symptoms associated with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>debilitating medical condition.\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Comparatively, \u00a7 8 refers primarily to the \u201cmedical purpose\u201d of marijuana and refers only to \u201cpatients,\u201d not \u201cregistered qualifying patient[s].\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Thus, \u00a7\u00a7 4 and 7(a) have no bearing on the requirements of \u00a7 8, and the requirements of \u00a7 4 cannot logically be imported into the requirements of \u00a7 8 by means of \u00a7 7(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">Further, in both cases, the prosecution concedes that the \u00a7 8 affirmative defense is available to unregistered patients. There is simply no principled basis on which to conclude that a defendant asserting a \u00a7 8 affirmative defense must meet some of the \u00a7 4 requisites, but not others, i.e., the registry card requirement. Moreover, if \u00a7 8 required a defendant to establish all the requirements of \u00a7 4, then unregistered patients would never be eligible for the affirmative defense under \u00a7 8. The result would be to effectively abolish the differing protections extended to registered and unregistered patients. This interpretation is internally inconsistent, renders the affirmative defense in \u00a7 8 a nullity, and is contrary to the electors\u2019 intent to permit both registered and unregistered patients to assert medical reasons for using marijuana as a defense to any prosecution involving marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">We also reject the argument that \u00a7 8 must incorporate \u00a7 4 because otherwise unregistered patients could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>possess more than 2.5 ounces of usable marijuana and keep more than 12 marijuana plants outside an enclosed locked facility while registered users cannot do so in an enclosed locked facility. The prosecution asserts that this result affords unregistered patients more protection under the MMMA than registered patients. This assertion is false and premised on a basic misunderstanding of how the differing protections of \u00a7 4 and \u00a7 8 operate. The stricter requirements of \u00a7 4 are intended to encourage patients to register with the state and comply with the act in order to avoid arrest and the initiation of charges and obtain protection for other rights and privileges. If registered patients choose not to abide by the stricter requirements of \u00a7 4, they will not be able to claim this broad immunity, but will be forced to assert the affirmative defense under \u00a7 8, just like unregistered patients.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> In that instance, registered patients will be entitled to the same lower level of protection provided to unregistered patients under \u00a7 8. This result is not absurd, but is the consequence of the incentives created by the wider protections of \u00a7 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-3\">Accordingly, we hold that to establish the elements of the affirmative defense in \u00a7 8, a defendant need not establish the elements of \u00a7 4. Any defendant, regardless of registration status, who possesses more than 2.5 ounces of usable marijuana or 12 plants not kept in an enclosed, locked facility may satisfy the affirmative defense under \u00a7 8. As long as the defendant can establish the elements of the \u00a7 8 defense and none of the circumstances in \u00a7 7(b) exists, that defendant is entitled to the dismissal of criminal charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-4\">Consequently, we reverse the Court of Appeals in <em>King </em>because it held that a defendant asserting a \u00a7 8 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>defense must also meet all the requirements of \u00a7 4. King, who had a valid patient registry card, may move for dismissal under \u00a7 8 and is not required to establish the immunity requirements of \u00a7 4 in order to satisfy the requirements of the \u00a7 8 affirmative defense.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> Similarly, Kolanek, who did not have a patient registry card at the time of the offense, is likewise entitled to move for dismissal under \u00a7 8 and does not have to establish the requirements of \u00a7 4 to be entitled to dismissal under \u00a7 8. The Court of Appeals in <em>Kolanek </em>reached this same conclusion, and we therefore affirm the Court of Appeals in this regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">C. TIMELINESS OF PHYSICIAN\u2019S STATEMENT UNDER \u00a7 8(a)(1)</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">The facts of <em>Kolanek </em>require us to determine <em>when </em>a physician must provide a statement that a defendant is likely to receive therapeutic or palliative benefit from the medical use of marijuana under \u00a7 8(a)(1) in order for the defendant to assert the affirmative defense. This inquiry requires us to answer two related questions: whether the MMMA applies retroactively, so that a defendant may have a viable defense based on a physician\u2019s statement made before the MMMA\u2019s effective date, and whether a physician\u2019s statement made after commission of the offense, but after enactment of the MMMA, satisfies \u00a7 8(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"405\">*405</page-number>1. PRE-MMMA PHYSICIAN\u2019S STATEMENTS</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">With regard to the first question, Kolanek argues that the MMMA applies retroactively and that he therefore has a viable affirmative defense based on his physician\u2019s statements made five months before enactment of the MMMA. In determining whether a statute adopted by initiative applies retroactively, the intent of the electors governs.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Generally, \u201c \u2018statutes are presumed to operate prospectively unless the contrary intent is clearly manifested.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> However, statutes that \u201coperate in furtherance of a remedy or mode of procedure\u201d and that \u201cneither create new rights nor destroy, enlarge, or diminish existing rights are generally held to operate retrospectively\u201d absent a contrary legislative intent.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">We agree with the Court of Appeals that \u00a7 8 creates an affirmative defense that did not previously exist for patients with serious medical conditions who are facing prosecution for possession of marijuana. This defense is a new substantive right available to some defendants.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> Section 8 cannot be fairly described as a mere correction to an oversight in the law. Absent from the MMMA is any specific indication that the act is to be applied retrospectively.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> Therefore, the presumption of pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>spective application controls. Accordingly, we conclude that the MMMA does not apply retroactively and only has prospective effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-3\">Consequently, it would make no sense to permit Kolanek to rely on a physician\u2019s statement made before the MMMA\u2019s enactment. At the time of the July 2008 conversation between Kolanek and his physician, state law prohibited the medical use of marijuana, and Breitenbach\u2019s speculative statements at that time could not have formed the basis of an affirmative defense. Because the MMMA does not apply retroactively, those pre-MMMA statements are legally inoperative in the present prosecution. Pre-MMMA physician\u2019s statements, which could not have been used to insulate a defendant from criminal prosecution before enactment of the MMMA, are not somehow transformed to protect a defendant after enactment of the MMMA. Because the MMMA does not apply retroactively, we hold that physician\u2019s statements made before its enactment cannot satisfy \u00a7 8(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">2. POSTOFFENSE PHYSICIAN\u2019S STATEMENTS</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">Kolanek also argues that the physician\u2019s statement he obtained six days after committing the offense satisfied the requirements of \u00a7 8(a)(1) because that provision merely requires that a physician \u201chas stated\u201d at some point in time that the patient has a medical need for marijuana. When subdivisions (1) through (3) are read together, it becomes clear that the physician\u2019s statement must necessarily have occurred before the commission of the offense if it is to be used as the basis for a \u00a7 8 defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">As noted, \u00a7 8(a) provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>(1) A physician <em>has stated </em>that, in the physician\u2019s professional opinion, after having completed a full assessment of the patient\u2019s medical history and current medical condition made in the course of a bona fide physician-patient relationship, the patient <em>is likely to receive </em>therapeutic or palliative benefit from the medical use of marihuana to treat or alleviate the patient\u2019s serious or debilitating medical condition or symptoms of the patient\u2019s serious or debilitating medical condition;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-3\">(2) The patient.. . [was] ... in possession of a quantity of marihuana that was not more than was reasonably necessary to ensure the uninterrupted availability of marihuana for the purpose of treating or alleviating the patient\u2019s serious or debilitating medical condition or symptoms ...; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b523-4\">(3) The patient... [was] engaged in the . .. possession ... of marihuana to treat or alleviate the patient\u2019s serious or debilitating medical condition or symptoms of the patient\u2019s serious or debilitating medical condition.<footnotemark>[51]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Beginning with \u00a7 8(a)(1), the term \u201chas stated\u201d is in the present perfect tense, which \u201cindicates action that was started in the past and has recently been completed or is continuing up to the present time.\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> In <em>People v </em>Stewart,<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> we considered the temporal limits of another present-perfect-tense term, \u201chas cooperated,\u201d and concluded it meant that a defendant\u2019s cooperation must have occurred sometime before the defendant applied for parole. Similarly, the term \u201chas stated\u201d indicates that the physician\u2019s statement must have been made sometime before a defendant filed the motion to dismiss under \u00a7 8 but not necessarily before commission of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>Other language of \u00a7 8(a)(1), however, indicates that the statement must in fact have been made even before the patient began using marijuana for the defense to apply. Reading the term \u201chas stated\u201d in conjunction with the language in the same sentence \u201cis likely to receive [benefit from the medical use of marijuana]\u201d indicates a future event that will occur after the physician\u2019s statement. Stated differently, \u00a7 8(a)(1) contemplates that a patient will not start using marijuana for medical purposes until after the physician has provided a statement of approval. It necessarily follows that any marijuana use before the physician\u2019s statement was not for medical purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-3\">The language of \u00a7 8(a)(2) and (3) supports this conclusion. Section 8(a)(2) requires a patient to establish that he or she had a \u201creasonably necessary\u201d quantity of marijuana \u201cfor the purpose of treating or alleviating the patient\u2019s serious or debilitating medical condition or symptoms . . . .\u201d Similarly, \u00a7 8(a)(3) requires a showing that the patient possessed the marijuana \u201cto treat or alleviate the patient\u2019s serious or debilitating medical condition or symptoms . . . .\u201d Both provisions presuppose a physician\u2019s prior diagnosis of a serious or debilitating medical condition or symptoms before a patient may treat the condition with marijuana. Consequently, reading these provisions together, it is clear that the physician\u2019s statement under \u00a7 8(a)(1) must have been made before a patient began using marijuana for medical purposes. Thus, we hold that in order to satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 8(a)(1), a defendant must establish that the physician\u2019s statement was made before the commission of the offense.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b525-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>This interpretation makes sense in light of the laws criminalizing possession, manufacture, and delivery of marijuana and the fact that the MMMA allows such charges to be dismissed under certain circumstances. A reasonable inference to be drawn from the MMMA\u2019s provisions allowing the medical use of marijuana is that \u00a7 8 is intended to protect those individuals who believe they have a genuine medical need for marijuana that has been recognized by a physician, but for whatever reason have not obtained a registry card. It would be illogical to extend this protection to individuals who have not obtained a physician\u2019s recognition of their medical need because the MMMA provides no protections to such individuals. An after-the-fact exception to criminal liability would encourage individuals to engage in self-medication or criminal activity on the basis of the possibility that if prosecuted they could then obtain a doctor\u2019s approval postoffense and avoid criminal charges.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> Because the MMMA was not intended to legitimize illegal marijuana use, it makes sense to require that a defendant obtain a physician\u2019s statement authorizing the medical use of marijuana before the defendant actually uses marijuana for that purpose.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b526-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>In <em>Kolanek, </em>neither the postarrest physician\u2019s statements nor the physician\u2019s statements made before the enactment of the MMMA satisfy, as a matter of law, the requirement under \u00a7 8(a)(1). Thus, Kolanek, although entitled to raise the \u00a7 8 defense in a motion for an evidentiary hearing, failed to establish at that hearing the requirements of the \u00a7 8 affirmative defense and he cannot now, for reasons we will explain, present the defense to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-3\">D. RAISING THE \u00a7 8 AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">The facts of <em>Kolanek </em>also require us to consider whether a defendant may reassert the defense at trial after the circuit court has denied the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss under \u00a7 8. As we have explained, the medical use of marijuana is a statutorily created affirmative defense. Section 8(a) provides that a patient or person may assert this defense in \u201cany prosecution involving marihuana\u201d and that the defense \u201cshall be presumed valid\u201d if its elements can be established.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> Section 8(b) provides that a person <em>\u201cmay </em>assert [this defense] in a motion to dismiss, and the charges <em>shall be dismissed following an evidentiary hearing </em>where the person shows the elements listed in subsection (a).\u201d<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> This scheme makes clear that the burden of proof rests with the defendant, that the defendant \u201cmay\u201d move to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>dismiss the charges by asserting the defense in a motion to dismiss, and that dismissal \u201cshall\u201d follow an evidentiary hearing. This last requirement is significant because it indicates that the \u00a7 8 defense cannot be asserted for the first time at trial, but must be raised in a pretrial motion for an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">A trial judge considering such a motion must be guided by well-established principles of criminal procedure. Questions of fact are the province of the jury, while question of law are reserved to the courts.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> Judges presiding over criminal trials regularly separate legal questions from factual ones, leaving to the jury those issues requiring factual resolution and pertaining to the credibility of witnesses and weight of the evidence. Trial judges undertake this same inquiry with respect to the defenses that a defendant raises. If, for example, a defendant raises a defense but fails to present evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that the elements of the defense have been met, then the defendant is not entitled to the defense instruction and the jury is precluded from considering the defense.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> Conversely, if a defendant produces sufficient evidence of the elements of the defense, then the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>question whether the defendant has asserted a valid defense is for the jury to decide.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">Thus, if a defendant raises a \u00a7 8 defense, there are no material questions of fact, and the defendant \u201cshows the elements listed in subsection (a),\u201d<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> then the defendant is entitled to dismissal of the charges following the evidentiary hearing. Alternatively, if a defendant establishes a prima facie case for this affirmative defense by presenting evidence on all the elements listed in subsection (a) but material questions of fact exist, then dismissal of the charges is not appropriate and the defense must be submitted to the jury.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> Conflicting evidence, for example, may be produced regarding the existence of a bona fide doctor-patient relationship or whether the amount of marijuana possessed was reasonable. Finally, if there are no material questions of fact and the defendant has not shown the elements listed in subsection (a), the defendant is not entitled to dismissal of the charges and the defendant cannot assert \u00a7 8(a) as a defense at trial. A trial judge must preclude from the jury\u2019s consideration evidence that is legally insufficient to support the \u00a7 8 defense because, in this instance, no reasonable juror could conclude that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>the defendant satisfied the elements of the defense.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> If the defendant believes that the circuit court erroneously denied the motion, the defendant\u2019s remedy is to apply for interlocutory leave to appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">In <em>Kolanek, </em>no reasonable jury could have concluded that Kolanek satisfied the elements of the \u00a7 8 affirmative defense. As explained, Kolanek did not meet the requirements of \u00a7 8(a)(1) because he did not obtain a physician\u2019s statement after enactment of the MMMA and before the commission of his offense. Thus, Kolanek failed to present evidence supporting the affirmative defense under \u00a7 8. Because no reasonable jury could have concluded that Kolanek is entitled to the defense as a matter of law, he is precluded from presenting evidence of this defense at trial. To allow submission of the defense to the jury when the defense fails as a matter of law would unnecessarily burden the jury and the circuit court with irrelevant testimony.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> Accordingly, the Court of Appeals erred by permitting Kolanek a \u201c \u2018second bite at the apple\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> by allowing him to present his defense to the jury despite its conclusion that he failed to present sufficient evidence that his use of marijuana was for medical purposes under \u00a7 8. We therefore reverse this portion of the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>In <em>King, </em>neither the district court nor the circuit court held an evidentiary hearing with regard to King\u2019s \u00a7 8 motion to dismiss. Because \u00a7 8 expressly requires an evidentiary hearing to obtain dismissal of criminal charges, we remand to the circuit court for it to hold such a hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-3\">IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">The plain language of the MMMA does not require that a defendant asserting the affirmative defense under \u00a7 8 also meet the requirements of \u00a7 4. Additionally, to meet the requirements of \u00a7 8(a)(1), a defendant must establish that the physician\u2019s statement occurred after the enactment of the MMMA and before the commission of the offense. If a circuit court denies a defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss under \u00a7 8 and there are no material questions of fact, then the defendant may not reassert the defense at trial; rather, the appropriate remedy is to apply for interlocutory leave to appeal. Thus, we reverse the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment in <em>King </em>and remand for an evidentiary hearing so that King may raise the affirmative defense under \u00a7 8. We affirm the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment in <em>Kolanek, </em>with the exception of the portion directing the circuit court to allow Kolanek to reassert the \u00a7 8 affirmative defense at trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b530-5\">Young, C.J., and Cavanagh, Marilyn Kelly, Markman, Hathaway, and ZAHRA, JJ., concurred with Mary Beth Kelly, J.</judges>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">appendix</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">In light of the need for guidance regarding the medical use of marijuana in Michigan, the following is designed to summarize our numerous holdings in these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>1.

A defendant is entitled to the dismissal of criminal charges under \u00a7 8 if, at the evidentiary hearing, the defendant establishes all the elements of the \u00a7 8 affirmative defense, which are (1) \u201c[a] physician has stated that, in the physician\u2019s professional opinion, after hav<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>ing completed a full assessment of the patient\u2019s medical history and current medical condition made in the course of a bona fide physician-patient relationship, the patient is likely to receive therapeutic or palliative benefit from the medical use of marihuana,\u201d (2) the defendant did not possess an amount of marijuana that was more than \u201creasonably necessary for this purpose,\u201d and (3) the defendant\u2019s use was \u201cto treat or alleviate the patient\u2019s serious or debilitating medical condition or symptoms . . . As long as a defendant can establish these elements, no question of fact exists regarding these elements, and none of the circumstances in \u00a7 7(b), MCL 333.26427(b), exists, then the defendant is entitled to dismissal of the criminal charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">8.

If a defendant moves for dismissal of criminal charges under \u00a7 8 and at the evidentiary hearing establishes prima facie evidence of all the elements of the \u00a7 8 affirmative defense, but material questions of fact exist, then dismissal of the charges is not appropriate and the defense must be submitted to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">10. If a defendant moves for dismissal of criminal charges under \u00a7 8 and at the evidentiary hearing fails to present evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that the defendant satisfied the elements of the \u00a7 8 affirmative defense, and there are no questions of fact, then the circuit court must deny the motion to dismiss the charges. In this instance, the defendant is not permitted to present the \u00a7 8 defense to the jury.
