We hold that the doctrine of imperfect self-defense does not exist in Michigan law as a freestanding defense mitigating murder to voluntary manslaughter, although we recognize that factual circumstances that have been characterized as imperfect self-defense may negate the malice element of second-degree murder. When analyzing the elements of manslaughter in light of defendant\u2019s self-defense claim, we conclude that the Court of Appeals erred in its ruling on the sufficiency of the prosecution\u2019s evidence to sustain defendant\u2019s manslaughter conviction. Therefore, we reverse in part the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> affirm the trial court\u2019s verdict of manslaughter, and remand this case to the Court of Appeals for further consideration of defendant\u2019s remaining issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Defendant, Verdell Reese, III, was charged with second-degree murder<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and, alternatively, voluntary manslaughter<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for the April 2008 death of Leonardo Johnson.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Defendant waived his right to a jury trial and proceeded to a bench trial in the Wayne Circuit Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>According to testimony adduced at trial, defendant owed $2,000 to Johnson, who was so upset about the debt that he had not spoken to defendant for approximately six months. Johnson lived with his cousin, James Long, in Detroit. Defendant was Long\u2019s close friend; Long described his relationship with defendant as being \u201clike brothers.\u201d Other testimony established that defendant visited the residence that Long and Johnson shared several times a week, even though Johnson did not like that defendant visited with such frequency.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">Long testified that on the evening of April 17-18, 2008, defendant and a man named John Smith (also known as J.T.) arrived at the Johnson/Long residence. After they had been at the house for a couple of hours, defendant and another friend, D, drove to a nearby store to purchase liquor. While defendant and D were at the store, Lakeshia Williams, who was Johnson and Long\u2019s cousin, left the house with Smith and walked toward the east, where she lived.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">Williams testified that, after she left the house, she saw Johnson approach from the east. Once Smith greeted Johnson, Williams heard two gunshots as defendant\u2019s car drove past them. She heard the first gunshot come from the driver\u2019s side of the car, but testified that she did not know the origin of the second gunshot. Smith placed himself between Williams and the street and, after the second gunshot, ran back to Johnson and Long\u2019s house. Johnson also continued on his way to his house, while Williams continued to her house and told her father about the gunshots she heard.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>Although Williams did not see the ensuing encounter between Johnson and defendant, Long did. After parking his car on the street, defendant walked toward the house and began talking with Long. According to Long, Johnson then approached the house and asked, \u201c[W] hat\u2019s up with that[?]\u201d to which defendant replied, \u201c[W]hat\u2019s up with what?\u201d Long testified that he then saw both defendant and Johnson step back and flinch. Long then heard a shot and saw muzzle fire coming from Johnson\u2019s direction, followed by five more shots that came from both Johnson\u2019s and defendant\u2019s positions.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">Once the shooting ended, Johnson ran across the street and through a vacant lot, while defendant remained in front of the house. A police officer responding to the shooting found Johnson\u2019s body facedown on the driveway of a house one block north of the shootings. Johnson\u2019s .40 caliber semiautomatic pistol was nearby and contained a live round that had jammed in the chamber. The medical examiner testified that Johnson had been shot twice and that the fatal bullet passed through his right arm into his chest.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">Defendant had been shot in the right leg. Long and Smith drove defendant to the hospital in defendant\u2019s car, but not before Long put defendant\u2019s gun in the house. Another officer was dispatched to the hospital where defendant was admitted and took a brief statement from defendant.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Defendant \u201cwas very vague [and] did not want to give any information about what happened.\u201d However, defendant did say that \u201che was standing outside by the car, heard several shots and was struck by several shots\u201d before being taken to the hospital. Defendant claimed to know neither the person who fired the shots nor where the shots had come from. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>He later changed his version of the events and told another officer that the shots came from a vacant lot across the street, although defendant again said that he could not provide a description of the shooter. In his third statement to police, defendant denied having seen who shot him and did not state the location of the shooter. However, he claimed that he did not think he was the intended target of the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">At the bench trial, defense counsel did not call any witnesses and argued that defendant did not shoot Johnson or, alternatively, that defendant shot Johnson in self-defense. The trial court made its findings of fact and issued its ruling from the bench. First, the trial court rejected defense counsel\u2019s claim that defendant did not shoot and kill Johnson: \u201cThere\u2019s no question .. . [that] Mr. Johnson shot at Mr. Reese and Mr. Reese shot at Mr. Johnson, okay. So to suggest that Mr. Reese never shot Mr. Johnson is a mischaracterization of what was proffered by way of evidence here.\u201d The trial court theorized that the shootings occurred because defendant and Johnson \u201c[couldn\u2019t] settle their scores in a diplomatic or a professional or responsible way.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">Addressing the defendant\u2019s alternative claim of self-defense, the trial court explained that the general rule of self-defense in Michigan is that \u201cone . .. may use deadly force in self-defense if he . .. honestly and reasonably believes that he is in imminent danger of death or great bodily harm and that deadly force is necessary to prevent such a death or great bodily harm.\u201d The trial court emphasized that \u201cthe touchstone of any claim of self-defense as justified for homicide is a necessity . . . .\u201d Thus, the trial court determined that \u201cwhether or not the Defendant himself was the original aggressor . . . [is] key to the evaluation of the self-defense defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b250-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>The trial court then explained that \u201cMichigan courts have recognized the doctrine of imperfect self-defense . .. [as] a qualified defense that mitigates second degree murder to voluntary manslaughter . . . The trial court continued, emphasizing that \u201cthe doctrine only applies where the Defendant would [have] had the right of self-defense [and] ... he acted as the initial aggressor.\u201d Finally, the trial court explained that an initial aggressor is entitled to the justification of self-defense when \u201che generally stopped fighting his assault and clearly let the other person know that he wanted to make peace.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">The trial court acquitted defendant of second-degree murder, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-5\">Is this homicide murder in the second degree? It is not. I don\u2019t think the People have proven [their] case beyond a reasonable doubt, but what the Court has found is that in this case there\u2019s no question that the victim shot at Mr. Reese.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">The trial court then concluded that defendant was the initial aggressor in the confrontation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-8\">The fact of the matter is, is that Mr. Reese was the one that fired the first shot as Mr. Johnson is walking back to his house and I agree with the prosecutor. This is Mr. Johnson\u2019s house, not Mr. Reese\u2019s house and Mr. Reese knew that if he\u2019d come to that house there would be trouble....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b250-9\">That being stated the evidence shows clearly the Defendant shot out of the car the first shot. That was verified by Miss Williams. She saw that. The Court can use circumstantial evidence and you [defendant] were in the car. This is verified by Mr. Long who says you got out of the car and as you\u2019re walking up, so, too, is Mr. Johnson and at that point this is where the evidence parts ways, who fired the first shot.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>This is where the imperfect self-defense comes in and that is clearly that you were the aggressor. The Court finds, Mr. Reese, that you were the aggressor in this case; that you fired the first shot prompting Mr. Johnson to be on guard, prompting Mr. Johnson to pull his weapon on you, prompting you then to pull your weapon on him and no question, this was a shoot-out.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">After identifying this as a case involving imperfect self-defense, the trial court applied the elements of manslaughter to the evidence in this case:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-7\">The Court finds the prosecution has proven, first, that the Defendant caused the death of Mr. Johnson; that is, that Mr. Johnson died as a result of multiple gunshot wounds.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-8\">Second, the Defendant had one of these three states of mind; he either intended to kill Mr. Johnson or he intended to do great bodily harm to Mr. Johnson and pumping five rounds into somebody is pretty much evidence that you intended to at least, at the very least, do great bodily harm to Mr. Johnson or knowingly created a very high risk of death or great harm bodily harm knowing that death or such harm would be the likely result of your actions and, third, the Defendant caused the death without legal justification.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-9\">The Court find[s] you to be the aggressor here. You\u2019re the one [who] shot the first shot. You\u2019re the one [who] scared Mr. Johnson into believing that now he had to defend himself. .. .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-10\">Mr. Johnson. .. said, [\u201c]what\u2019s up with that[?\u201d] The Court infers from that statement that he\u2019s wondering, what the heck you doing shooting a gun off by his house, and the Court finds that you shot him ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b251-11\">The Court finds that the Defendant did not act in lawful self-defense and the People have proven that he did not act in lawful self-defense because he was the initial aggressor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"136\">*136</page-number>He didn\u2019t back off. He didn\u2019t say, okay, it didn\u2019t mean anything. Hey, Mr. Johnson[,]... I didn\u2019t mean anything ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-5\">The Court\u2019s going to find the Defendant guilty of voluntary manslaughter, homicide manslaughter for the reasons stated on this record!<footnotemark>[7]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">The trial court subsequently sentenced defendant, as a third-offense habitual offender, to 8 to 30 years\u2019 imprisonment for the manslaughter conviction.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Immediately before sentencing, defense counsel moved for a new trial on the basis of potential testimony by Smith. Defendant renewed this request in a postsentence pro se motion for a new trial on the basis of counsel\u2019s failure to call Smith as a witness. The trial court denied both motions in a subsequent written opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">On appeal, defendant claimed that the prosecution had failed to prove that he was the initial aggressor and that, therefore, he had a valid self-defense claim. Second, defendant claimed that the trial court had abused its discretion by denying his posttrial motions for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">The Court of Appeals vacated defendant\u2019s conviction for voluntary manslaughter and remanded for a new trial on the basis of defendant\u2019s first claim of error.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"137\">*137</page-number>panel stated that it was \u201cunable to reconcile the uncontroverted facts with what appears to be the trial court\u2019s inaccurate application of the doctrine of imperfect self-defense.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> In particular, the panel questioned the trial court\u2019s conclusion that defendant was the initial aggressor:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b253-5\">The evidence indicates the initial firing of two shots in an unknown direction and by an unknown individual before the face-to-face confrontation between Reese and Johnson. Only the first shot was attributed to Reese based on Williams indicating she heard the shot and assumed it was from his vehicle. Williams could not place whether the shooter was in the driver\u2019s seat or back seat of the vehicle. There is no testimony or evidence to identify who fired the second shot or where it originated. Based on Johnson\u2019s continued ambulation toward Reese and Long\u2019s house and engaging Reese in conversation, albeit very briefly, it seems reasonable to assume that Johnson did not feel threatened or intimidated by this random, preceding gunfire, which requires us to question the trial court\u2019s labeling of Reese as the initial aggressor to justify the use of imperfect self-defense to convict him of voluntary manslaughter.<footnotemark>[11]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">The Court of Appeals criticized the trial court\u2019s characterization of defendant\u2019s intent to harm Johnson as \u201cproblematic on a number of levels.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> First, the panel claimed that there was a \u201clack of evidence that Reese personally fired five shots during the events involved\u201d because \u201c[t]he medical examiner identified only two wounds to Johnson.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">Second, the panel claimed that the trial court\u2019s ruling \u201cwould contraindicate the applicability of imperfect self-defense,\u201d given the trial court\u2019s conclusion that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>Smith interfered with Williams\u2019s ability to see the shots from the car \u201c[be]cause he knows something is coming down ... ,\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> If this observation could be attributed to defendant\u2019s state of mind, the panel reasoned, that \u201cstate of mind would preclude the use of imperfect self-defense.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">Third, the panel claimed that an \u201cinsurmountable\u201d difficulty in the trial court\u2019s ruling was that the trial court had \u201cfailed to address Reese\u2019s intent at the crucial point in time \u2014 the initial provocation.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The panel then concluded that the evidence did not support the assumption that defendant acted with the required intent during the initial provocation because even if defendant fired the initial shots before the deadly confrontation, \u201cthere is no evidence that he aimed his weapon at Johnson\u201d and the only evidence regarding defendant\u2019s intent was \u201csome cryptic comments between Johnson and Reese before they exchanged fire . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">Finally, the panel criticized the trial court for failing to account for the \u201cdelay between the first shots and any further aggression,\u201d which the panel speculated was a sufficient length of time for defendant to \u201cwithdraw from the conflict\u201d and for Johnson to \u201cinitiate a new conflict.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">In the end, the Court of Appeals concluded that it could not \u201cstate with any confidence that either the factual findings or the conclusions of law by the trial court are sufficient to sustain Reese\u2019s conviction for voluntary man<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"139\">*139</page-number>slaughter.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Accordingly, the panel vacated defendant\u2019s manslaughter conviction and remanded this case to the trial court for a new trial, although it affirmed defendant\u2019s convictions and sentences for being a felon in possession of a firearm and possessing a firearm during a felony. Because it granted defendant a new trial, the panel did not address defendant\u2019s second claim of error, involving defendant\u2019s motion for a new trial based on Smith\u2019s potential testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">This Court granted the prosecution\u2019s application for leave to appeal and ordered the parties to address \u201cwhether the doctrine of imperfect self-defense can mitigate second-degree murder to voluntary manslaughter and, if so, whether the doctrine was appropriately applied to the facts of this case by the Wayne Circuit Court.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">Whether the doctrine of imperfect self-defense exists under Michigan law is a question of law, which this Court reviews de novo.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> In examining the sufficiency of the evidence, \u201cthis Court reviews the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecutor to determine whether any trier of fact could find the essential elements of the crime were proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> A trial court\u2019s findings of fact may not be set aside unless they are clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> A ruling is clearly erroneous \u201cif the reviewing court is left with a definite and firm conviction that the trial court made a mistake.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">Because the trial court concluded that the doctrine of imperfect self-defense applied to this case, and because the Court of Appeals reversed the trial court\u2019s verdict on the ground that the trial court had misapplied the doctrine to the facts of the case, this case presents this Court with the question whether the doctrine of imperfect self-defense exists under Michigan law. Although the Court of Appeals has adopted and applied the doctrine of imperfect self-defense,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> this Court has neither adopted it nor defined its scope and applicability.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">A. MICHIGAN LAW OF HOMICIDE</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">In analyzing the doctrine of imperfect self-defense to determine whether it can mitigate second-degree murder to voluntary manslaughter, we follow the foundational principles of interpretation that this Court has outlined regarding Michigan\u2019s law of homicide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-8\">Because Michigan\u2019s homicide statutes proscribe \u201cmurder\u201d without providing a particularized definition of the elements of that offense or its recognized defenses,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> we are required to look to the common law at the time of codification for guidance. See Const 1963, art 3, \u00a7 7;<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>People v Couch, </em>436 Mich 414, 418-421; 461 NW2d 683 (1990). Where a statute employs the general terms of the common law to describe an offense, courts will construe the statutory crime by looking to common-law definitions. See <em>Couch, </em>[436 Mich] at 419, quoting <em>Morissette v United States, </em>342 US 246, 263; 72 S Ct 240; 96 L Ed 288 (1952):</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b256-9\">\u201c \u2018[W]here [a legislature] borrows terms of art in which are accumulated the legal tradition and meaning of centuries of practice, it presumably knows and adopts the cluster of ideas that were attached to each borrowed word in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"141\">*141</page-number>body of learning from which it was taken and the meaning its use will convey to the judicial mind unless otherwise instructed. In such case, absence of contrary direction may be taken as satisfaction with widely accepted definitions, not as a departure from them.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b257-4\">The criminal law, as defined at common law and codified by legislation, \u201cshould not be tampered with except by legislation,\u201d and this rule applies with equal force to common-law terms encompassed in the defenses to common-law crimes. <em>In re Lamphere, </em>61 Mich 105, 109; 27 NW 882 (1886).<footnotemark>[26]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b257-7\">When the Legislature codifies a common law offense and thereby adopts the common law defenses to that offense, this Court is \u201cproscribed from expanding or contracting the defense as it existed at common law.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number><em>Riddle </em>correctly observed that Michigan statutory law proscribes, but does not define, \u201cmurder.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The same can be said of \u201cmanslaughter.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Because both of these classes of homicides existed at common law, Michigan courts have defined the statutory terms in light of their common law meanings.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">For example, as early as 1858, this Court defined \u201cmurder\u201d as when \u201ca person of sound memory and discretion unlawfully kills any reasonable creature in being, in the peace of the state, with malice prepense or aforethought, either express or implied\u201d and stated that \u201c[t]his, the common law definition, is still retained in our statute.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> The malice enshrined in the common law understanding of murder \u201cdid not mean deliberate and calculating malice, but only malice existing at any time before the act so as to be its moving cause or concomitant.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Applying this traditional understanding of com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>mon law murder, this Court established the following elements of second-degree murder: \u201c(1) a death, (2) caused by an act of the defendant, (3) with malice, and (4) without justification or excuse.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">The common law distinguished manslaughter from murder by the absence of malice. Blackstone defined manslaughter as \u201cthe unlawful killing of another without malice either express or implied\u201d and further classified manslaughter as being committed \u201ceither voluntarily, upon a sudden heat; or involuntarily, but in the commission of some unlawful act.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">This Court explained the crime of voluntary manslaughter further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-7\">Manslaughter may in some cases be intentional. In such a case it differs from murder because it is provoked. It is not justifiable to take life under provocation, and yet the provocation may be serious enough to deprive the intentional killing of its malicious character, so that it is neither murder on the one hand nor justifiable or excusable on the other. It is a very serious crime, though not reckoned as done with malice.<footnotemark>[34]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">In <em>People v Mendoza, </em>this Court recently reiterated this common law distinction between murder and manslaughter:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b259-9\">[T]o show voluntary manslaughter, one must show that the defendant killed in the heat of passion, the passion was caused by adequate provocation, and there was not a lapse of time during which a reasonable person could control his passions. See <em>People v Pouncey, </em>437 Mich 382, 389; 471 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>NW2d 346 (1991). Significantly, provocation is not an element of voluntary manslaughter. See <em>People v Moore, </em>189 Mich App 315, 320; 472 NW2d 1 (1991). Rather, provocation is the circumstance that negates the presence of malice. <em>[People v] Scott, </em>[6 Mich 287, 295 (1859)].<footnotemark>[35]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Accordingly, <em>Mendoza </em>concluded that \u201cthe elements of voluntary manslaughter are included in murder, with murder possessing the single additional element of malice.\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">B. SELF-DEFENSE AND IMPERFECT SELF-DEFENSE</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">Traditionally, the common law of self-defense justifies an otherwise unlawful homicide by allowing \u201ca man [to] protect himself from an assault, or the like, in the course of a sudden broil or quarrel, by killing him who assaults him.\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> However, Blackstone reiterated that \u201c[t]his right of natural defence does not imply a right of attacking: for, instead of attacking one another for injuries past or impending, men need only have recourse to the proper tribunals of justice.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">This understanding of self-defense is consistent with the fact that this Court from a very early time characterized self-defense in terms of necessity: \u201cHuman life is not to be lightly disregarded, and the law will not permit it to be destroyed unless upon urgent occasion.\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> This Court\u2019s decision in <em>Riddle </em>reiterated that \u201cthe touchstone of <em>any </em>claim of self-defense, as a justification for homicide, is necessity,\u201d<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> <em>Riddle </em>also explained that while there is no duty to retreat from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>within one\u2019s \u201ccastle,\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> or from a sudden, violent attack,<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> a \u201cvoluntary participant in mutual combat\u201d has the duty to retreat to a safer place before resorting to deadly force.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b261-4\">The Texas Court of Appeals appears to have been the first appellate court to define a separate doctrine of \u201cimperfect self-defense\u201d as it is constituted today, which it did in an 1882 decision.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> In <em>Reed v </em>State, the defendant was convicted of second-degree murder for killing his paramour\u2019s husband, apparently while the defendant was <em>in flagrante delicto </em>with the victim\u2019s wife. The defendant claimed that he acted in self-defense because the husband drew his weapon upon discovering the defendant with his wife. Nevertheless, the trial court concluded that the defendant was not entitled to self-defense in light of the fact that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>husband had a justification under Texas law to kill the defendant.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> The appellate court acknowledged that the preservation of one\u2019s life was \u201cthe first great law of nature\u201d but qualified that right\u2019s application: \u201c[T]he right of self-defense, though inalienable, is and should to some extent be subordinated to rules of law . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Accordingly, the court divided self-defense into two separate classes:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b262-5\">A perfect right of self-defense can only obtain and avail where the party pleading it acted from necessity, and was wholly free from wrong or blame in occasioning or producing the necessity which required his action. If, however, he was in the wrong, \u2014 if he was himself violating or in the act of violating the law, \u2014 and on account of his own wrong was placed in a situation wherein it became necessary for him to defend himself against an attack made upon himself which was superinduced or created by his own wrong, then the law justly limits his right of self-defense, and regulates it according to the magnitude of his own wrong.<footnotemark>[47]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b262-6\">Thus, if someone is physically attacked when committing a felony, \u201cand in resisting such attack he slay[s] his assailant, the law would impute the original wrong to the homicide and make it murder.\u201d<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> On the other hand, \u201cif the original wrong was or would have been a misdemeanor, then the homicide growing out of or occasioned by it, though in self-defense from an assault made upon him, would be manslaughter under the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>law.\u201d<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> After the Texas court adopted the doctrine of imperfect self-defense, several other states followed suit.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">In Michigan, the theory of imperfect self-defense first appeared in a footnote to a 1971 Court of Appeals opinion, although the term itself was not used in that opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b263-6\">In general, mitigating circumstances are the commission of the killing in a sudden heat of passion caused by adequate legal provocation. 1 Wharton\u2019s Criminal Law and Procedure, \u00a7 274, p 580 <em>et seq.; </em>Perkins on Criminal Law (2d ed), p 54. Wharton and Perkins say that even where such mitigating circumstances are not present the crime may be manslaughter, not murder, when the actor kills in self-defense but was not entitled to do so under the circumstances, either because he was not free from fault or his belief that he was in danger was not justified.<footnotemark>[51]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">Then Judge Levin\u2019s obiter dictum<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> remained just that for nine years, until the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>People v Springer </em>reversed a second-degree murder conviction on the basis of the defendant\u2019s \u201cimperfect <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>right to self-defense.\u201d<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> The <em>Springer </em>panel explained that this \u201cqualified right of self-defense has been adopted in several jurisdictions\u201d and determined that a defendant \u201cis guilty of manslaughter, not murder\u201d when \u201cthe defendant would be entitled to claim self-defense except for the fact that he was at fault in provoking the danger to himself. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">After the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in Springer, several other decisions of the Court of Appeals applied the doctrine of imperfect self-defense to situations in which the defendant was the initial aggressor.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> However, the lead Court of Appeals opinion in <em>People v Kemp </em>warned that \u201cthe inquiry regarding the applicability of the doctrine of imperfect self-defense requires more than just a determination whether defendant was the initial aggressor.\u201d<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> Rather, the court must \u201cfocus ... on <em>\u2018the intent with which the accused brought on the quarrel or </em>difficulty\u2019 \u201d giving rise to lethal force.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>this principle, a defendant who \u201cinitiate [s] the confrontation between himself and the victim with the intent to kill or do great bodily harm\u201d is not entitled to have the crime be mitigated to manslaughter.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b265-4\">Although Judge CONNOR agreed with the panel\u2019s decision to remand for further trial court proceedings regarding voluntary manslaughter, he criticized the lead opinion\u2019s emphasis on the doctrine of imperfect self-defense as \u201ccounterproductive\u201d in light of the fact that the panel was \u201conly following the longstanding law of voluntary manslaughter in Michigan.\u201d<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> Judge CONNOR explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-5\">In Michigan, the crime of murder is reduced to manslaughter if committed \u201cunder the influence of passion or in the heat of blood produced by adequate provocation.\u201d CJI 16:4:02(1). If defendant\u2019s desire to kill his victim was actually born of the moment, if it was the result of such provocation that would cause a reasonable person to kill in the heat of passion, then his crime is manslaughter, not murder. See <em>People v Younger, </em>380 Mich 678, 681-682; 158 NW2d 493 (1968).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b265-6\">I do not believe that the theory of imperfect self-defense adds anything to Michigan\u2019s traditional notions of self-defense or voluntary manslaughter, and I would not require the trial court to apply the theory of imperfect self-defense in this case.<footnotemark>[60]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">Although Judge MICHAEL J. KELLY also concurred in the remand, he too criticized the doctrine of imperfect self-defense, calling it \u201cslippery and undeveloped,\u201d and suggested that this Comb take up the issue.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> We do so today.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>C. IMPERFECT SELF-DEFENSE DOES NOT EXIST UNDER MICHIGAN LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">Under Michigan law, the doctrine of imperfect self-defense does not exist as a freestanding defense that mitigates a murder to manslaughter because it was not recognized as such under the common law at the time the Legislature codified the crimes of murder and manslaughter.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">As discussed, the doctrine first appeared in an 1882 Texas decision, postdating the Michigan Legislature\u2019s 1846 codification of the common law crimes of murder and manslaughter and their attendant defenses. It is significant that the doctrine of imperfect self-defense developed <em>after </em>the Legislature codified the common law crimes of murder and manslaughter, which means that the Legislature <em>could not have </em>codified the doctrine, into the murder and manslaughter statutes. In further support of this conclusion, we note that when adopting the doctrine of imperfect self-defense, the <em>Springer </em>panel <em>acknowledged </em>that the doctrine was an innovation in the common law by stating that it <em>\u201chas been adopted </em>in several jurisdictions . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> Thus, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number><em>Springer </em>panel erred by purporting to change the common law of this state <em>after </em>the Legislature codified the common law crimes of murder and manslaughter in 1846. This Court has emphatically stated that once the Legislature codifies a common law crime and its attendant common law defenses, the criminal law of this state concerning that crime \u201cshould not be tampered with except by legislation . .. .\u201d<footnotemark>63</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b267-5\">Although we reject the doctrine of imperfect self-defense, many circumstances that involve what the Court of Appeals labeled \u201cimperfect self-defense\u201d can nevertheless provide grounds for a fact-finder to conclude that the prosecution has not proved the malice element that distinguishes murder from manslaughter. However, we emphasize that the operative analysis for the fact-finder is not whether the circumstances involving \u201cimperfect self-defense\u201d exist. Rather, the operative analysis is whether the prosecution has proved the element of malice beyond a reasonable doubt. This focus rightly turns on the <em>actual elements </em>of murder and manslaughter, rather than any label of \u201cimperfect self-defense\u201d as a judicially created shorthand that risks becoming unmoored from the actual element distinguishing the two crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-6\">\u201c[T]he elements of voluntary manslaughter are included in murder, with murder possessing the single additional element of malice.\u201d<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> Malice itself \u201cevolved from being merely an intent to kill to also evidencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>the absence of mitigating circumstances.\u201d<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> After describing several examples of malice, Blackstone explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-6\">[The] general rule [is] that all homicide is malicious, and, of course, amounts to murder, unless where <em>justified </em>by the command or permission of the law; <em>excused </em>on the account of accident or self-preservation; or <em>alleviated </em>into manslaughter, by being either the involuntary consequence of some act, not strictly lawful, or (if voluntary), occasioned by some sudden and sufficiently violent provocation.<footnotemark>[66]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-7\">This understanding of malice is consistent with this Court\u2019s 1859 determination that the element of malice is negated when the \u201cdirect intent to kill\u201d was caused by \u201cgreat provocations sufficient to excite the passions beyond the control of reason.\u201d<footnotemark>67</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b268-8\">This Court\u2019s <em>Mendoza </em>decision summarized the scope of the mitigating circumstances that the common law traditionally recognized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b268-9\">[B]oth murder and voluntary manslaughter require a death, caused by defendant, with either an intent to kill, an intent to commit great bodily harm, or an intent to create a very high risk of death or great bodily harm with knowledge that death or great bodily harm was the probable result. However, the element distinguishing murder from manslaughter \u2014 malice\u2014is negated by the presence of provocation and heat of passion.<footnotemark>[68]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b268-10\">Additional circumstances \u2014 including the label \u201cimperfect self-defense\u201d \u2014 were not themselves recognized at common law as negating the element of malice. Because the Legislature chose to codify the common law offenses of murder and manslaughter, thereby including the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>attendant defenses and mitigations, we are foreclosed from altering that which the Legislature adopted.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> Accordingly, we reiterate the <em>Mendoza </em>Court\u2019s formulation of the distinction between murder and manslaughter and hold that there is no independent defense of imperfect self-defense in Michigan law.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\"><em>W. </em>APPLICATION</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">Both the trial court and the Court of Appeals analyzed defendant\u2019s claim within the context of imperfect self-defense. The Court of Appeals granted defendant relief in the form of a new trial on the manslaughter charge because it determined that the trial court had both misinterpreted the evidence of this case and misapplied the doctrine of imperfect self-defense to the evidence. In light of our holding that the doctrine of imperfect self-defense does not exist as an independent mitigation in Michigan law, we need not review the Court of Appeals\u2019 analysis of the doctrine except as it relates to the Court of Appeals\u2019 application of the facts of this case to the elements of manslaughter.<footnotemark>71</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b270-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>Voluntary manslaughter requires \u201ca death, caused by defendant, with either an intent to kill, an intent to commit great bodily harm, or an intent to create a very high risk of death or great bodily harm with knowledge that death or great bodily harm was the probable result.\u201d<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> The trial court concluded that the prosecution had proved the first two elements beyond a reasonable doubt, rejecting defendant\u2019s theory that he did not shoot Johnson. The court based its conclusion on Long\u2019s eyewitness testimony that defendant and Johnson engaged in a shooting match in front of Johnson and Long\u2019s house. This conclusion is not clearly erroneous and, along with the unrebutted testimony of the medical examiner, establishes the first two elements of voluntary manslaughter \u2014 that defendant caused Johnson\u2019s death by gunshot. The Court of Appeals rightly did not disturb this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b270-5\">The trial court also concluded that the prosecution had proved the third element of manslaughter beyond a reasonable doubt \u2014 that defendant caused Johnson\u2019s death with the requisite intent. The Court of Appeals, however, rejected as \u201cproblematic on a number of levels\u201d the trial court\u2019s claim that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b270-6\">\u201cpumping five rounds into somebody is pretty much evidence that you intended to at least, at the very least, do great bodily harm to Mr. Johnson or knowingly created a very high risk of death or great bodily harm knowing that death or such harm would be the likely result of your actions. \u201d<footnotemark>[73]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b271-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>The panel explained that \u201cthere is no evidence that five shots were expended during these events\u201d and that, at most, \u201conly three gunshots can be attributed to Reese, not five as stated by the trial court.\u201d<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> Even if the Court of Appeals was correct regarding the number of shots defendant fired, the trial court\u2019s reasonable finding that \u201cthis was a shoot-out\u201d between Johnson and defendant alone renders its conclusion regarding the intent element of manslaughter not clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> Because defendant participated in the shootout, defendant clearly had the intent to create a very high risk of great bodily harm to Johnson, knowing that death or great bodily harm was the probable result of his actions. This intent existed regardless of whether the shooting was justified in self-defense, as defendant claims.<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> Accordingly, the trial court did not clearly err by concluding that the prosecution had proved all three elements of manslaughter beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b271-5\">Because defendant claims that he was entitled to assert self-defense as a complete justification for shooting Johnson, we also address this claim. \u201c[0]nce the defendant satisfies the initial burden of production, the prosecution bears the burden of disproving the common law defense of self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> Defendant has satisfied his initial burden of production because he \u201cproduced] some evidence from which a [fact-finder] could conclude that the elements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>necessary to establish a prima facie defense of self-defense exist. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> The prosecution claims that defendant was not entitled to assert self-defense, however, because defendant was the initial aggressor in the encounter with Johnson. The trial court agreed with this view.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-5\">To analyze the trial court\u2019s conclusion that defendant was not entitled to the justification of self-defense, we must examine its conclusion that by firing two shots from his car at the outset of the confrontation, defendant was the initial aggressor. The Court of Appeals panel concluded that the trial court had erred by finding that defendant fired two shots from his car at the outset of the confrontation with Johnson. The panel observed that \u201c[ojnly the first shot was attributed to Reese based on Williams indicating she heard the shot and assumed it was from his vehicle.\u201d<footnotemark>79</footnotemark> The panel also determined that \u201c[t]here is no testimony or evidence to identify who fired the second shot or where it originated.\u201d<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> However, Williams testified that she heard two gunshots, at least one of them coming from the car that she testified was defendant\u2019s. Although Williams did not know the source of the second gunshot, it was not clearly erroneous for the trial court to conclude, on the basis of the logical inferences drawn from Williams\u2019s testimony, that defendant fired both shots from his car. Moreover, Long\u2019s testimony was consistent with this conclusion because Long testified that defendant\u2019s car arrived at his and Johnson\u2019s residence shortly after he heard the two gunshots from the direction of defendant\u2019s car. There being evidence to support the trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>court\u2019s conclusion, the Court of Appeals erred by rejecting the trial court\u2019s conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">Next, the Court of Appeals concluded that \u201cit seems reasonable to assume that Johnson did not feel threatened or intimidated by this random, preceding gunfire .. . .\u201d<footnotemark>81</footnotemark> To begin with, the Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion does not disprove the trial court\u2019s conclusion that defendant was the initial aggressor. Even so, the Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion was erroneous. The panel reached its conclusion by noting that Johnson \u201ccontinued [to] ambulat[e] toward Reese and Long\u2019s house and engag[ed] Reese in conversation. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> However, the undisputed testimony is that Johnson was walking toward <em>his own </em>house, not defendant\u2019s house, a point that the trial court correctly appreciated and that severely undermines the Court of Appeals\u2019 theory that defendant could not have felt threatened or intimidated by the initial gunshots. Moreover, although there was testimony that Johnson \u201cengag[ed] Reese in conversation,\u201d that conversation was hardly premised on the lack of a perceived threat. Rather, Long testified that Johnson asked, \u201c[W]hat\u2019s up with that[?]\u201d In interpreting this question, the trial court \u201cinfer[red] from that statement that he\u2019s wondering, [\u2018]what the heck you doing shooting a gun off by his house[?\u2019]\u201d While this question could have been innocuous, given the <em>context </em>of the situation, the trial court\u2019s interpretation of this exchange was not clearly erroneous. The trial court concluded that Johnson did not view the preceding gunfire as \u201crandom,\u201d as the Court of Appeals opined, but saw it as an aggressive act. This conclusion was not clearly erroneous. Thus, when all the circumstances are considered as a whole, the Court of Appeals erred by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>discounting the trial court\u2019s factual conclusion that as the initial aggressor in the shootout between defendant and Johnson, defendant was not entitled to use the doctrine of self-defense as justification for shooting Johnson.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">Although the trial court went on to discuss this finding in the context of imperfect self-defense, it remains relevant to reviewing the trial court\u2019s conclusion that defendant was <em>not </em>entitled to self-defense as a complete justification for shooting Johnson. This Court reiterated in <em>Riddle </em>that an \u201c \u2018aggressor in a chance-medley (an ordinary fist fight, or other nondeadly encounter)\u2019 \u201d who \u201c \u2018finds that his adversary has suddenly and unexpectedly changed the nature of the contest and is resorting to deadly force. . . must not resort to deadly force if there is any other reasonable method of saving himself.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>83</footnotemark> In this case, the trial court correctly applied the law from <em>Riddle </em>and specifically found that defendant had <em>not </em>engaged in one such reasonable method of defusing the situation. The trial court explained: \u201c[Defendant] didn\u2019t back off. He didn\u2019t say, okay, it didn\u2019t mean anything. \u201d The trial court did not clearly err by concluding that defendant was not entitled to self-defense as a complete justification to homicide.<footnotemark>84</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>The Court of Appeals also examined the timing of the events and concluded that \u201cthere was a delay between the first shots and any further aggression between these combatants,\u201d which might have allowed for a cooling-off period.<footnotemark>85</footnotemark> Thus, the panel speculated that \u201cJohnson knew when he approached and engaged Reese verbally that he was no longer in imminent danger but elected to initiate a new conflict.\u201d<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> However, as <em>Riddle </em>explained, an initial aggressor may find that his adversary \u201c \u2018suddenly and unexpectedly changed the nature of the contest and is resorting to deadly force.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>87</footnotemark> While the trial court and the Court of Appeals disagreed about whether the events constituted a single, escalating conflict or separate incidents, the trial court\u2019s decision to treat them as a single, escalating conflict was not clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>88</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">The Court of Appeals\u2019 opinion is deficient for all the foregoing reasons, but when considered as a whole, it is difficult to escape the conclusion that the panel simply substituted its interpretation of the testimony for the trial court\u2019s. This is inappropriate when the standard of review requires an appellate court to accept the trial court\u2019s findings of fact unless they are <em>clearly errone</em>ous.<footnotemark>89</footnotemark> This standard is higher than the standard for reviewing questions of law because the finder of fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>often must choose between conflicting and contradictory testimony and is \u201cin a far better position than is this Court\u201d \u2014 or the Court of Appeals \u2014 \u201cto determine [witnesses\u2019] credibility.\u201d<footnotemark>90</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">In summary, the evidence as outlined here was sufficient for a fact-finder to have concluded that defendant was guilty of each of the elements of voluntary manslaughter and that defendant was not entitled to use self-defense. Moreover, the trial court did not clearly err in rendering its findings of fact on the elements of voluntary manslaughter and defendant\u2019s self-defense claim. Accordingly, defendant is not entitled to a new trial on the ground that the evidence was insufficient.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">V CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">Because the common law of murder and manslaughter did not recognize the doctrine of \u201cimperfect self-defense\u201d at the time the Legislature codified those crimes, this Court concludes that the doctrine of imperfect self-defense does not independently mitigate murder to manslaughter. Rather, in deciding between murder and the lesser included offense of manslaughter, the fact-finder must determine whether the prosecution has proved the element distinguishing the two crimes: malice. While some \u201cimperfect self-defense\u201d situations may involve \u201cprovocation [as] the circumstance that negates the presence of malice,\u201d<footnotemark>91</footnotemark> courts may not use the doctrine of imperfect self-defense to shortcut any analysis of the elements of the two crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">In this case, the Court of Appeals erred by concluding that the trial court\u2019s verdict was clearly erroneous. For <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>the foregoing reasons, the trial court\u2019s verdict was not clearly erroneous and is affirmed.

Hence, a determination whether imperfect self defense should continue to exist in Michigan law is unnecessary to the resolution of this case and irrelevant. The appropriate holding is that the Court of Appeals incorrectly applied the clear error standard in setting aside the finding that defendant was the initial aggressor.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">Because the trial court acquitted defendant of second degree murder, for the prosecution to renew the count would constitute double jeopardy.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As the prosecution stated in its arguments before this Court, we cannot now consider whether defendant should have been convicted of murder; that ship has sailed. At this point, the prosecution can charge and try defendant only for manslaughter. Hence, the doctrine of imperfect self-defense could not arise again in this matter, it not being a mitigating defense to manslaughter. Consequently, answering the question in this decision of whether imperfect self-defense exists has no effect on the relief available to either party.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">Further supporting this position is the fact that both parties stated at oral argument that this is not the case to address the doctrine of imperfect self-defense. However intertwined the doctrine may have been with the lower court\u2019s ruling, we need not adjudicate its appropriateness in order to decide the case. The majority has selectively dissected the defense out of the lower court\u2019s analyses and dispatched it from Michigan\u2019s jurispru<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>dence despite the fact that doing so was unnecessary and neither party requested it. I would reverse the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment and reinstate defendant\u2019s conviction for manslaughter. But I would not reach out to strike down the doctrine of imperfect self-defense.</p>\n<judges id=\"b279-4\">CAVANAGH and HATHAWAY, JJ., concurred with MARILYN Kelly, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b278-6\"> See also MCL 768.33, which states: \u201cWhen a defendant shall he acquitted or convicted upon any indictment for an offense, consisting of different degrees, he shall not thereafter he tried or convicted for a different degree of the same offense .. .</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
