We also hold that evidence admissible under MCL 768.27a remains subject to MRE 403, which provides that a court may exclude relevant evidence if the danger of unfair prejudice, among other considerations, outweighs the evidence\u2019s probative value.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In applying the balancing test in MRE 403 to evidence admissible under MCL 768.27a, however, courts must weigh the propensity inference in favor of the evidence\u2019s probative value rather than its prejudicial effect. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals in <em>People v Watkins, </em>Docket No. 142031, vacate the judgments of the lower courts in <em>People v Pullen, </em>Docket No. 142751, and remand the latter case to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"Ah9\">A. DOCKET NO. 142031</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">In Docket No. 142031, defendant, Lincoln Anderson Watkins, appeals by leave granted the judgment of the Court of Appeals affirming his convictions and sentences. Watkins was charged with five counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct (CSC-I)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and one count of second-degree criminal sexual conduct (CSC-II)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for allegedly molesting a 12-year-old girl.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">The Court of Appeals summarized the allegations of sexual abuse that the prosecution presented at the pretrial stage:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"457\">*457</page-number>The victim in the instant case was a 12-year-old girl whose family lived next door to defendant and whose father was defendant\u2019s business partner. The victim had known defendant and his wife since she was two years old and regarded defendant as a father figure. The victim babysat defendant\u2019s youngest child. In May 2006, defendant showed her a picture of his penis being inserted into a vagina. The next day, while she was playing video games with defendant\u2019s daughter in his bedroom, he touched her breasts. The day after that incident the victim was again babysitting at defendant\u2019s house when defendant sent his daughter into another room, unbuttoned the victim\u2019s pants, and told her to pull them down and get on his bed. She stood up and pulled down her pants, and when she bent over, defendant inserted his penis into her vagina from behind repeatedly until he ejaculated. She and defendant engaged in intercourse again in his bedroom the following day while she was babysitting his daughter. The victim claimed that she and defendant engaged in intercourse yet another time in defendant\u2019s bedroom and one time in his living room. The victim alleged that, about two weeks later, defendant asked her if she wanted to have sex, but she declined because she was menstruating. The victim claimed that defendant nevertheless instructed her to stand up and lift her skirt, and, when she complied, he inserted his penis into her vagina. The victim asserted that she worried that defendant might force her to have sexual intercourse in the future, so she told her mother that she had been having a sexual relationship with defendant.<footnotemark>[5]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">Before trial, the prosecution filed a motion to introduce evidence of other acts to establish a common plan or scheme, as permitted under MRE 404(b).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> In particu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"458\">*458</page-number>lar, the prosecution sought to have a witness, EW^ testify that Watkins had also engaged in vaginal-penile penetration with her.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Like the victim in the instant action, EW was a minor at the time, and she had a close relationship with Watkins\u2019s wife. The trial court granted the motion over Watkins\u2019s objection. The following is a summary of EW\u2019s testimony offered at defendant\u2019s first trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-4\">At the first trial, [EW] testified that defendant\u2019s wife is her first cousin and that she [EW] met defendant when she was 14 years old. [EW] loved defendant like a brother and often babysat for defendant\u2019s children. On one occasion when she was 15 years old, she visited defendant and his wife for the weekend and helped them with their infant. While alone with [EW], defendant commented on her sexual attractiveness, took her hand, and began leading her up the stairs to his bedroom on the second floor. [EW] was reluctant to go upstairs, so defendant pulled down her pants and inserted his penis into her vagina while they were still in the hallway. After eventually moving to defendant\u2019s bedroom, they continued having intercourse until defendant ejaculated. [EW] stated that the episode began a two-year sexual relationship, during which they had sexual encounters about 15 different times at defendant\u2019s home, her mother\u2019s home, and in empty houses where defendant was painting. [EW] explained that defendant included her in his family; they went to an amusement park together, went out to eat together, and watched movies together.<footnotemark>[8]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Following the close of trial, the jury commenced deliberations but was unable to reach a verdict. Consequently, the trial court declared a mistrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>At the opening of his second trial, Watkins moved for the trial court to reconsider its ruling on the other-acts evidence under MRE 404(b). This time, the trial court granted the motion. It reasoned that the other acts described by EW were too dissimilar from the charged acts to justify their use to show a common plan or scheme. The prosecution applied for leave to file an interlocutory appeal while the case proceeded to trial for the second time.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">The trial court declared a second mistrial when it learned that a juror had overheard a supervisor in the prosecutor\u2019s office comment about the court\u2019s exclusion of the other-acts evidence while riding in a courthouse elevator. Meanwhile, the Court of Appeals peremptorily reversed the trial court\u2019s decision to exclude EW\u2019s testimony and remanded the case to the trial court with instructions for it to determine which aspects of EW\u2019s proposed testimony were admissible under MCL 768.27a as evidence of criminal sexual conduct against a minor. Subsequently, this Court vacated the Court of Appeals\u2019 order and remanded the case to the Court of Appeals with directions to consider whether MCL 768.27a conflicted with MRE 404(b) and, if so, whether the statute prevailed over the rule of evidence.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">In a published opinion, the Court of Appeals held that MCL 768.27a conflicted with MRE 404(b) and that the statute prevailed over the rule of evidence.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Accordingly, it remanded the case to the trial court to determine under MCL 768.27a which aspects of EW\u2019s testimony related to the commission of a criminal sexual act against a minor.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This Court granted leave to appeal,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"460\">*460</page-number>but later vacated that order after determining that leave had been improvidently granted.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Watkins preserved all his previous constitutional challenges as the case proceeded to trial for the third time.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">At the third trial, the victim, then 15 years old, testified that she had known Watkins all her life, having lived next door to him and having occasionally babysat one of his children. She also stated that she was good friends with Watkins\u2019s wife, whom she considered her godmother. She considered Watkins her boyfriend. According to the victim, when she was 12 years old, Watkins approached her at a Memorial Day gathering and showed her sexually explicit images that were on his cell phone. She claimed that Watkins touched her breasts the next time she babysat and penetrated her vaginally the day after that. This conduct allegedly occurred consensually for the next couple of weeks. Sometime thereafter, when the victim arrived to babysit, she declined Watkins\u2019s request to engage in sexual activity because she was menstruating. She testified that Watkins\u2019s insistence disturbed her and she thought he might rape her. She told her mother what had happened. Although the victim did not want to get Watkins in trouble, she agreed to speak with the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">The trial court allowed EW to testify regarding other-acts evidence under MCL 768.27a. According to EW; about 10 years earlier, when she was 15 years old, she had often babysat Watkins\u2019s oldest child. She testified that, during one visit, Watkins led her upstairs by the hand. He allegedly began kissing her, and their interactions culminated in sexual penetration. According to <em>EW, </em>their sexual relationship lasted a couple of years.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>Watkins did not take the stand or call any witnesses. Defense counsel argued that the witnesses lacked credibility because their statements were inconsistent and uncorroborated. Ultimately, the jury returned a verdict finding Watkins guilty of four counts of CSC-I and one count of CSC-II, but not guilty of the remaining count of CSC-I.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">Watkins raised several arguments on appeal, including that MCL 768.27a conflicts with MRE 404(b) and the rule of evidence prevails over the statute; that EW\u2019s testimony should have been excluded under MRE 403, which the trial court failed to consider; and that the trial court failed to hold a hearing to determine the proper scope of EW\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-6\">The Court of Appeals affirmed in an unpublished opinion per curiam.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> While agreeing with Watkins that MCL 768.27a conflicts with MRE 404(b), it rejected the argument that the rule of evidence takes priority over the statute. Instead, it observed that a previous panel had already held that MCL 768.27a, as a substantive rule of evidence, did not interfere with the Supreme Court\u2019s authority to regulate court administration and, therefore, the statute takes priority over the rule of evidence.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> With regard to MRE 403, it held that evidence admissible under MCL 768.27a remains subject to MRE 403.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Although acknowledging that the trial court had failed to apply MRE 403, the Court of Appeals reasoned that it had already decided the issue of admissibility when it directed the trial court to determine which aspects of EW\u2019s testimony fit the requirements of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>MCL 768.27a and stated that those aspects were admissible.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals concluded that EW\u2019s testimony would have been admissible even had the trial court considered MRE 403:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b578-5\">The evidence that defendant had assaulted another minor.. . was relevant because it tended to show that it was more probable than not that the victim was telling the truth. The similarity of the relationships (E.W was defendant\u2019s wife\u2019s cousin while the victim thought of his wife as a godmother) and defendant\u2019s modus operandi (taking advantage of minors who had a close relationship with his wife and were present in his home to baby sit) also made the likelihood of defendant\u2019s behavior toward the victim more probable. Moreover, the probative value of the evidence was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. Whether the victim was telling the truth had significant probative value in deciding whether defendant should be convicted of the crimes for which he was charged. Further, defense counsel was able to effectively cross-examine E.W regarding the fact that she thought of defendant as her boyfriend and maintained contact with him after their relationship ended, even expressing a desire to have his child. Finally, the court instructed the jury on how to properly use the other acts evidence^]<footnotemark>[18]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b578-6\">Thus, the Court of Appeals concluded that the testimony was relevant and not more prejudicial than probative and that any error by the trial court was harmless.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b578-7\">Finally, the Court of Appeals concluded that the trial court had abused its discretion when it failed to determine which aspects of EW\u2019s testimony met the requirements of MCL 768.27a.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> EW\u2019s testimony regarding sexual intercourse with Watkins that occurred from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>time she was 16 years old and after was not admissible under the statute.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Nonetheless, as the Court of Appeals explained, the only incident for which EW provided specific details occurred when she was 15 years old.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Moreover, the testimony regarding events that occurred from the time EW was 16 years old and after was helpful to the defense because it highlighted the fact that EW deeply cared for Watkins.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Accordingly, it held that the error in admitting all of EW\u2019s testimony \u201cwas not inconsistent with substantial justice.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> We granted leave, instructing the parties to address</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b579-5\">(1) whether MCL 768.27a conflicts with MRE 404(b) and, if it does, (2) whether the statute prevails over the court rule . .., (3) whether the omission of any reference to MRE 403 in MCL 768.27a (as compared to MCL 768.27b(l)), while mandating that evidence of other offenses \u201cis admissible and may be considered for its bearing on any matter to which it is relevant,\u201d would violate a defendant\u2019s due process right to a fair trial, and (4) whether MCL 768.27a interferes with the judicial power to ensure that a criminal defendant receives a fair trial, a power exclusively vested in the courts of this state under Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 if. <footnotemark>[25]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b579-6\">B. DOCKET NO. 142751</p>\n<p id=\"b579-7\">In Docket No. 142751, the prosecution appeals by leave granted the judgment of the Court of Appeals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>affirming the trial court\u2019s opinion and order granting the motion in limine filed by defendant, Richard Kenneth Pullen. Pullen was charged with two counts of CSC-II<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> and one count of aggravated indecent exposure<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> for acts allegedly committed against his then 12-year-old granddaughter. At the preliminary examination, the victim testified that Pullen had touched her breasts with his hands under her clothes multiple times and that the touching started when she was five or six years old. She also claimed that Pullen touched her \u201ccrotch\u201d under her clothes on a weekly basis. With regard to Pullen\u2019s alleged indecent exposure, the victim testified that, when she was 11 or 12 years old, she saw Pullen touching his penis in the next room while on the computer and, at the time, Pullen knew she could see him masturbating.</p>\n<p id=\"b580-5\">Before trial, the prosecution filed a notice of intent to introduce under MCL 768.27a other acts of sexual misconduct against a minor. Specifically, the prosecution sought to introduce a 1989 police report containing allegations that Pullen had sexually abused his then 16-year-old daughter. In the report, Pullen\u2019s daughter alleged multiple instances of digital penetration in which he \u201cchecked if [she] was still a virgin.\u201d In addition, the report contained allegations that defendant had frequently touched his daughter\u2019s breasts, buttocks, and genital area while wrestling and massaging her back, had repeatedly walked in on her while she was undressed, and had arranged to expose himself to her when he was bathing. Although Pullen had apparently admitted engaging in some of the conduct alleged in the report, including the digital penetration, criminal charges were never filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b581-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>In response to the notice of intent to introduce the 1989 police report, Pullen filed a motion in limine to bar the evidence as unduly prejudicial. The trial court granted Pullen\u2019s motion and excluded the evidence. After concluding that it \u201cmust perform the balancing test set forth in MRE 403 before admitting evidence under MCL 768.27a,\u201d the trial court ruled that the 1989 police report failed to survive that balancing:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-4\">[I]t is the opinion of this Court that the prejudicial impact of the evidence proffered by the People substantially outweighs the probative value because it involves more serious facts than those in the case at bar. [Pullen] is charged with having sexual contact with his granddaughter, as well as exposing himself to his granddaughter. The police report from 1989 sets forth facts of a long pattern of sexual abuse by [Pullen] against his daughter, including multiple digital penetrations .... According to the police report, [Pullen] admitted to police that he had perpetrated these acts upon his daughter. Should this evidence be presented to the jury, it is highly probable that the jury would not be able to separate the two cases and would likely decide the case based on emotional impact rather than logical reasons. Thus, this evidence does not survive the balancing test of MRE 403 and is not admissible.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b581-5\">The Court also finds that it would be fundamentally unfair and a violation of due process to force [Pullen] to defend accusations from over 20 years ago for which charges were never filed. [Pullen] is in an untenable position to try to disprove more serious and greatly dated charges. It is unlikely that he would be able to do so, and to require him to do so would be manifestly unjust.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b581-6\">Following the ruling, the trial court agreed to stay the trial court proceedings to allow the prosecution to pursue an appeal. The Court of Appeals granted the prosecution\u2019s interlocutory application for leave to appeal and affirmed the trial court\u2019s ruling in an unpub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>lished opinion per curiam.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> It concluded that MRE 403 applies to evidence admissible under MCL 768.27a and held that the trial court did not abuse its discretion by excluding the evidence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-6\">Even given the fact that the evidence is relevant because the past conduct also involves a family member, it is highly likely that the jury would convict defendant solely based on his past conduct out of inflamed passion, anger or shock. In addition, because the prior conduct did not result in a conviction or even in the filing of charges, the trial court correctly observed that the necessary presentation of this evidence concerning the earlier alleged conduct would not only overshadow the question of defendant\u2019s guilt that is directly at issue in the instant case, it would be virtually impossible for defendant to defend himself against the earlier unproven allegations.<footnotemark>[29]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-7\">The prosecution applied for leave to appeal in this Court. We granted leave, instructing the parties to address</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b582-8\">(1) whether the omission of any reference to MRE 403 in MCL 768.27a (as compared to MCL 768.27b(l)), while mandating that evidence of other offenses \u201cis admissible and may be considered for its bearing on any matter to which it is relevant,\u201d would violate a defendant\u2019s due process right to a fair trial and (2) whether the Court should rule that evidence of other offenses described in MCL 768.27a is admissible only if it is not otherwise excluded under MRE 403.<footnotemark>[30]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b582-9\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b582-10\">Constitutional questions and issues of statutory interpretation are questions of law, which this Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>reviews de novo.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> In addition, we review for an abuse of discretion a trial court\u2019s decision to exclude evidence.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> A trial court abuses its discretion when it chooses an outcome falling outside the range of principled outcomes.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b583-5\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b583-6\">A. MCL 768.27a AND MRE 404(b) CONFLICT</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">Addressing whether MCL 768.27a prevails over MRE 404(b) requires the initial determination whether the statute and court rule irreconcilably conflict.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> It is only in cases of irreconcilable conflict that we must determine whether the Legislature has enacted a statute that improperly supplants the Court\u2019s exclusive authority under Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 5 to promulgate rules regarding the practice and procedure of the courts.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> \u201cWe do not lightly presume that the Legislature intended a conflict, calling into question this Court\u2019s authority to control practice and procedure in the courts.\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">When construing a statute, whether to determine the existence of a conflict or otherwise, our primary objective remains the same: to ascertain and give effect to the Legislature\u2019s intent.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> We begin our analysis with the text. If the statutory language is plain and unambiguous, courts must \u201cenforce the statute as written <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>and follow its plain meaning, giving effect to the words used by the Legislature.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> We are also mindful of the need to read statutory provisions as a whole, focusing on not only the individual words and phrases but also the placement of those words and phrases in the context of the broader legislative scheme.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> The same principles govern the construction of court rules.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">In this case, we have little trouble concluding that MCL 768.27a and MRE 404(b) irreconcilably conflict. MRE 404(b)(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b584-6\">Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, scheme, plan, or system in doing an act, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident when the same is material, whether such other crimes, wrongs, or acts are contemporaneous with, or prior or subsequent to the conduct at issue in the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">Thus, MRE 404(b) requires the exclusion of other-acts evidence if its only relevance is to show the defendant\u2019s character or propensity to commit the charged offense.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> \u201cUnderlying the rule is the fear that a jury will convict the defendant inferentially on the basis of his bad character rather than because he is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of the crime charged.\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Preventing the jury from drawing this inference recognizes the risk that propensity evidence might \u201c \u2018weigh too much with the jury and ... so overpersuade them as to prejudge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>one with a bad general record and deny him a fair opportunity to defend against a particular charge.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">By contrast, MCL 768.27a provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-6\">(1) Notwithstanding [MCL 768.27],<footnotemark>[44]</footnotemark> in a criminal case in which the defendant is accused of committing a listed offense against a minor, evidence that the defendant committed another listed offense against a minor is admissible and may be considered for its bearing on any matter to which it is relevant.

Thus, the statute establishes an exception to MRE 404(b) in cases involving a charge of sexual misconduct against a minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">Although an issue of first impression for this Court, federal courts have concluded that FRE 414,<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> the federal counterpart of MCL 768.27a, conflicts with FRE 404(b).<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> One court explained, \u201c[FRE 414] allows the prosecution to use evidence of a defendant\u2019s prior acts for the purpose of demonstrating to the jury that the defendant had a disposition of character, or propensity, to commit child molestation.\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> As another federal court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>succinctly stated, \u201c[propensity evidence is precisely what [FRE] 414 permits.\u201d<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> The Michigan Court of Appeals has similarly reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b588-4\">When a defendant is charged with a sexual offense against a minor, MCL 768.27a allows prosecutors to introduce evidence of a defendant\u2019s uncharged sexual offenses against minors without having to justify their admissibility under MRE 404(b). In many cases, it allows evidence that previously would have been inadmissible, because it allows what may have been categorized as propensity evidence to be admitted in this limited context.<footnotemark>[54]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">We reach the same conclusion. Because we cannot read MCL 768.27a and MRE 404(b) in harmony, the question becomes which decree prevails \u2014 that of the Legislature or that of the judiciary.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">B. MCL 768.27a PREVAILS OVER MRE 404(b)</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">A rule of evidence will prevail over a conflicting statute only if the statute unconstitutionally infringes on this Court\u2019s authority under Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 5 to \u201cestablish, modify, amend and simplify the practice and procedure in all courts of this state.\u201d In accordance with separation-of-powers principles, this Court\u2019s authority in matters of practice and procedure is exclusive and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>therefore beyond the Legislature\u2019s power to exercise.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> This exclusive authority, however, extends only to rules of practice and procedure, as \u201cthis Court is not authorized to enact court rules that establish, abrogate, or modify the substantive law.\u201d<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> Accordingly, our task is to determine whether MCL 768.27a is an impermissible rule governing the practice and procedure of the courts or a valid enactment of substantive law.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\"><em>McDougall v Schanz </em>addressed whether MCL 600.2169, a statute requiring that expert witnesses offered in medical malpractice actions possess certain medical practice or teaching experience, violated the Court\u2019s exclusive authority regarding rules of practice and procedure.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> We harbored no doubt in <em>McDougall </em>that MCL 600.2169 acts as a rule of evidence, given that its application determines the admissibility of expert testimony in medical malpractice cases.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> MCL 768.27a similarly determines the admissibility of evidence that the defendant committed an offense against a minor in a case charging the defendant with the commission of a separate offense against a minor. Therefore, MCL 768.27a is also a rule of evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">But our analysis does not end upon reaching this conclusion. In <em>McDougall, </em>we rejected the mechanical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>approach of characterizing all rules of evidence as procedural.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> Instead, we established a sensible approach to separate procedural rules of evidence on the one hand from substantive rules of evidence on the other:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b590-6\">[A] statutory rule of evidence violates Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 5 only when \u201c \u2018no clear legislative policy reflecting considerations other than judicial dispatch of litigation can be identified....\u2019\u201d Therefore, \u201c [i]f a particular court rule contravenes a legislatively declared principle of public policy, having as its basis something other than court administration... the [court] rule should yield.\u201d We agree . .. that \u201c[m]ost rules of evidence have been made by courts. Now and then the legislature has, as a result of policy consideration [sic] over and beyond matters involving the orderly dispatch of judicial business, enacted rules of evidence. The distinction previously pointed out between policy considerations involving the orderly dispatch of judicial business on the one hand and policy considerations involving something more than that on the other hand is the distinction that must be carried through into the evidence field.\u201d<footnotemark>[60]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b590-8\">Thus, statutory rules of evidence that reflect policy considerations limited to \u201cthe orderly dispatch of judicial business,\u201d i.e., court administration, are procedural and violate Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 5. But statutory rules of evidence that reflect policy considerations \u201cover and beyond matters involving the orderly dispatch of judicial business\u201d are substantive, and in the case of a conflict with a court rule, the legislative enactment prevails. As noted in <em>McDougall, </em>procedural rules of evidence involving the orderly dispatch of judicial business are \u201c \u2018those rules of evidence designed to allow the adjudicatory process to function effectively.... Ex-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>ampies are rules of evidence designed to let the jury have evidence free from the risks of irrelevancy, confusion and fraud.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> <em>McDougall </em>identified the line separating statutory rules of evidence that are constitutional from those that impermissibly venture into the area of practice and procedure over which this Court has exclusive authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Applying <em>McDougall, </em>we conclude that MCL 768.27a is a valid enactment of substantive law to which MRE 404(b) must yield. The statute is based on policy considerations over and beyond the orderly dispatch of judicial business. We note several policy reasons that support the Legislature\u2019s decision to allow other-acts evidence in cases involving sexual misconduct against minors. As the United States Supreme Court has observed, \u201c[w]hen convicted sex offenders [including child molesters] reenter society, they are much more likely than any other type of offender to be rearrested for a new rape or sexual assault.\u201d<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> Evidence of guilt in child molestation cases is typically hard to come by because in most cases the only witness is the victim, whose testimony may not be available, helpful, or deemed credible because of his or her age. It may also be difficult for a jury to believe that a defendant is capable of engaging in such egregious behavior with a child. Consistent with our analysis is the fact that federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>courts considering the validity of FRE 414 have identified similar policy considerations underlying the rule that are over and beyond the orderly dispatch of judicial business. Those considerations include \u201c[p]romoting the effective prosecution of sex offenses,\u201d \u201cthe reliance of sex offense cases on difficult credibility determinations,\u201d and \u201cthe \u2018exceptionally probative\u2019 value of a defendant\u2019s sexual interest in children.\u201d<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> In our judgment, MCL 768.27a was not \u201c \u2018designed to allow the adjudicatory process to function effectively. . . .\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> Rather, it reflects a substantive legislative determination that juries should be privy to a defendant\u2019s behavioral history in cases charging the defendant with sexual misconduct against a minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-5\">In sum, the reasons for enacting MCL 768.27a were not to further the orderly dispatch of judicial business, but to address a substantive concern about the protection of children and the prosecution of persons who perpetrate certain enumerated crimes against children and are more likely than others to reoffend. Accordingly, we hold that MCL 768.27a does not run afoul of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 5, and in cases in which the statute applies, it supersedes MRE 404(b).<footnotemark>65</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">The dissent would instead hold that MCL 768.27a is unconstitutional. The dissent first takes the position that MCL 768.27a should fail the <em>McDougall </em>test because the statute primarily concerns the judicial dispatch of litigation, which the dissent says is true of all rules that have the \u201ceffect\u201d of \u201ctelling [courts] what evidence juries can hear.\u201d<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> This is a misapplication of <em>McDougall. </em>If it were true that all rules that operate to tell courts what evidence is admissible concerned the judicial dispatch of litigation, then all rules of evidence would be procedural. But <em>McDougall </em>specifically rejected the approach of mechanically characterizing all rules of evidence as procedural. Therefore, the dissent\u2019s position is inconsistent with a proper reading <em>o\u00ed McDougall.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">Alternatively, the dissent would refine or discard the <em>McDougall </em>test. The dissent\u2019s proposed test would treat the legislative policy concerns surrounding a statute\u2019s enactment as irrelevant to whether an evidentiary rule is substantive or procedural.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> According to the dissent, the only inquiry should be whether the <em>function </em>of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>statute \u201cis to tell the courts what evidence they may admit in a court proceeding. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> This approach would also mechanically characterize all rules of evidence as procedural because, as a purely <em>functional </em>matter (if we truly disregard every underlying policy concern), all evidentiary rules tell the courts what evidence is admissible.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> Thus, although the dissent criticizes the majority\u2019s application of the <em>McDougall </em>test as vastly underinclusive in defining which evidentiary rules qualify as procedural, the dissent\u2019s alternative approaches are vastly overinclusive in defining the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">The dissent cites the rules of privilege as an example of an area of substantive rulemaking. But rules relating to privilege still serve the exclusive <em>function </em>of telling the courts what evidence is admissible at trial and, therefore, would be procedural under the dissent\u2019s test. Privilege rules function to dictate the admissibility of communications made between parties in certain relationships; accordingly, privilege rules tell the courts what evidence is admissible at trial.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>The dissent asserts that privileges and other substantive rules of evidence \u201cdo far more than dictate what evidence is admissible in a court proceeding; they directly affect people\u2019s out-of-court behavior.\u201d<footnotemark>71</footnotemark> We do not disagree that privileges influence out-of-court behavior by \u201cpromoting] free and open expression in certain relationships with the confidence that what is communicated will not be revealed in a court proceeding.\u201d<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> What the dissent fails to appreciate, however, is that the goal of promoting free expression and confidence in certain relationships is nothing more than a policy concern advanced by the Legislature, which runs directly counter to the dissent\u2019s position that legislative policy concerns are irrelevant. It is neither proper nor sensible to conclude that court rules should yield to statutes that are grounded in some policy concerns (e.g., a concern for promoting free expression and confidence in certain relationships) but not others (e.g., a concern for protecting children and addressing the high recidivism rates of child molesters). Thus, we question the wisdom of drawing a distinction that is based on whether an evidentiary rule directly influences people\u2019s out-of-court behavior.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Finally, we note as one example that the dissent\u2019s proposed test would mean the end of Michigan\u2019s rape-shield statute, MCL 750.520j, a consequence that the dissent does not dispute. Yet the United States Supreme <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>Court has endorsed Michigan\u2019s rape-shield statute and described it as \u201crepresenting] a valid legislative determination that rape victims deserve heightened protection against surprise, harassment, and unnecessary invasions of privacy.\u201d<footnotemark>73</footnotemark> And although the Supreme Court did not specifically address the separation-of-powers issue,<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> rape-shield laws have been upheld even in the face of a constitutional provision analogous to Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 5.<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> We reiterate our belief that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"481\">*481</page-number>sensible divide is between rules involving considerations limited to the orderly dispatch of judicial business, which are procedural, and rules involving considerations over and beyond the orderly dispatch of judicial business, which are substantive. This position recognizes the powers and limitations of both the judicial and the legislative rulemaking authority.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">C. MCL 768.27a REMAINS SUBJECT TO MRE 403</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Having determined that MCL 768.27a is a valid enactment of substantive law, the question remains whether evidence admissible under the statute may nonetheless be excluded under MRE 403. For the reasons that follow, we hold that evidence admissible pursuant to MCL 768.27a may nonetheless be excluded under MRE 403 if \u201cits probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">The argument against applying MRE 403 to evidence admissible under MCL 768.27a comes not from the text of either MRE 403 or MCL 768.27a, but from the text of MCL 768.27b, which pertains to other-acts evidence in domestic violence cases. MCL 768.27b provides that \u201cevidence of the defendant\u2019s commission of other acts of domestic violence is admissible for any purpose for which it is relevant, <em>if it is not otherwise excluded under Michigan rule of evidence 403.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>76</em></footnotemark><em> </em>It is this emphasized <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"482\">*482</page-number>portion of the statute that has generated disagreement surrounding whether MRE 403 applies to MCL 768.27a.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-5\">Unlike MCL 768.27b, MCL 768.27a does not explicitly mention MRE 403: \u201cNotwithstanding [MCL 768.27], . . . evidence that the defendant committed another listed offense against a minor is admissible and may be considered for its bearing on any matter to which it is relevant.\u201d Accordingly, it is argued that if the Legislature expressly made other-acts evidence under MCL 768.27b subject to MRE 403 in cases of domestic violence, then the failure to mention MRE 403 in MCL 768.27a indicates that the Legislature did not intend MRE 403 to apply with regard to other-acts evidence in cases involving sexual misconduct against minors. We reject the invitation to draw this inference.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">Significantly, the Legislature did not draft these statutes simultaneously. MCL 768.27a was enacted by 2005 PA 135, which became effective January 1, 2006, whereas MCL 768.27b was enacted by 2006 PA 78, which became effective March 24, 2006. The Legislature\u2019s \u201csilence\u201d from which it is urged we draw an inference occurred in the earlier enactment. It is one thing to infer legislative intent through silence in a simultaneous or subsequent enactment, but quite another to infer legislative intent through silence in an earlier enactment, which is only \u201csilent\u201d by virtue of the subsequent enactment.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-7\">We are also mindful of \u201cconsidering] whether [the statute and rule of evidence] can be construed so as not to conflict,\u201d<footnotemark>77</footnotemark> and \u201c[w]e do not lightly presume that the Legislature intended a conflict. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> Unlike the irreconcilable conflict between MCL 768.27a and MRE <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>404(b), there is nothing inherent in the statute that prevents the application of MRE 403. And because MCL 768.27a makes no specific mention of MRE 403, we choose not to presume that the Legislature intended that MRE 403 not apply to other-acts evidence admissible under the statute. The Legislature could have expressly exempted evidence admissible under MCL 768.27a from analysis under MRE 403, but it did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-4\">Furthermore, as the United States Supreme Court has observed,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b599-5\">\u201cnot every silence is pregnant.\u201d In some cases, Congress intends silence to rule out a particular statutory application, while in others Congress\u2019 silence signifies merely an expectation that nothing more need be said in order to effectuate the relevant legislative objective. An inference drawn from congressional silence certainly cannot be credited when it is contrary to all other textual and contextual evidence of congressional intent.<footnotemark>[79]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">In closely examining the statutes, all other textual and contextual evidence of the Legislature\u2019s intent runs contrary to inferring that MRE 403 does not apply to evidence admissible under MCL 768.27a. Despite some similarities, there are notable differences between the two statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-7\">First, the Legislature used the permissive term \u201cmay\u201d in MCL 768.27a but not in MCL 768.27b. Under MCL 768.27a, \u201cevidence that the defendant committed another listed offense against a minor <em>is </em>admissible,\u201d but the statute goes on to provide that such evidence <em>\u201cmay </em>be considered for its bearing on any matter to which it is relevant.\u201d<footnotemark>80</footnotemark> When the statute is read as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>whole, the phrase \u201cis admissible\u201d is qualified by the phrase \u201cmay be considered,\u201d thereby indicating that admissibility remains subject to some level of discretion on the part of the trial court. As this Court has explained, \u201ccourts should give the ordinary and accepted meaning to . . . the permissive word \u2018may\u2019 unless to do so would clearly frustrate legislative intent as evidenced by other statutory language or by reading the statute as a whole.\u201d<footnotemark>81</footnotemark> Because there is no indication in MCL 768.27a that \u201cmay\u201d should be interpreted contrary to its generally accepted meaning, the term is permissive, not mandatory. By providing that evidence admissible under MCL 768.27a <em>\u201cmay </em>be considered,\u201d the Legislature necessarily contemplated that evidence admissible under the statute need not be considered in all cases and that whether and which evidence would be considered would be a matter of judicial discretion, as guided by the rules of evidence. The most obvious rule available to guide courts in exercising this discretion is MRE 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-4\">By contrast, MCL 768.27b contains no permissive language. MCL 768.27b(l) simply provides that \u201cevidence of the defendant\u2019s commission of other acts of domestic violence is admissible for any purpose for which it is relevant. . . .\u201d Perhaps it was the choice to omit the permissive language that prompted the Legislature to qualify the admissibility of other-acts evidence under MCL 768.27b with the language \u201cif it is not otherwise excluded under Michigan rule of evidence 403.\u201d We choose not to speculate in this regard. Whatever motivated the Legislature to draft the statutes differently, we must give meaning to the permissive term \u201cmay\u201d used by the Legislature in MCL 768.27a.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>Second, we must give effect to the prefatory clause \u201c[notwithstanding [MCL 768.27]\u201d contained in MCL 768.27a but absent from MCL 768.27b. MCL 768.27a provides, \u201cNotwithstanding [MCL 768.27], in a criminal case in which the defendant is accused of committing a listed offense against a minor, evidence that the defendant committed another listed offense against a minor is admissible and may be considered for its bearing on any matter to which it is relevant.\u201d The specific mention of MCL 768.27, and no other rule or principle of evidence, is significant. MCL 768.27 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b601-5\">In any criminal case where the defendant\u2019s motive, intent, the absence of, mistake or accident on his part, or the defendant\u2019s scheme, plan or system in doing an act, is material, any like acts or other acts of the defendant which may tend to show his motive, intent, the absence of, mistake or accident on his part, or the defendant\u2019s scheme, plan or system in doing the act, in question, may be proved, whether they are contemporaneous with or prior or subsequent thereto; notwithstanding that such proof may show or tend to show the commission of another or prior or subsequent crime by the defendant.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b601-6\">Giving effect to the statute\u2019s reference to MCL 768.27, MCL 768.27a means that other-acts evidence in cases involving sexual misconduct against a minor \u201cmay be considered for its bearing on any matter to which it is relevant\u201d <em>notwithstanding </em>that MCL 768.27 limits the admissibility of other-acts evidence to consideration for noncharacter purposes. MCL 768.27a does not apply \u201cnotwithstanding any rule or principle of evidence,\u201d but only \u201c[notwithstanding [MCL 768.27].\u201d Put simply, we cannot interpret the prefatory phrase \u201c[notwithstanding [MCL 768.27]\u201d to mean \u201cnotwithstanding [MCL 768.27] and MRE 403.\u201d We similarly refuse to read into MCL 768.27a a legislative intent to foreclose the application of other ordinary rules of evidence, such as those pertaining to hearsay and privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>In sum, the \u201csilence\u201d in MCL 768.27a arose only by virtue of the subsequent enactment of MCL 768.27b, MCL 768.27a can be read in harmony with MRE 403, and we must give effect to the permissive term \u201cmay\u201d and the phrase \u201c[notwithstanding [MCL 768.27]\u201d that are present in MCL 768.27a but absent from MCL 768.27b. For all these reasons, we hold that MRE 403 applies to evidence admissible under MCL 768.27a.<footnotemark>82</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b602-4\">D. COURTS MUST WEIGH THE PROPENSITY INFERENCE IN FAVOR OF THE EVIDENCE\u2019S PROBATIVE VALUE</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">Our conclusion that other-acts evidence admissible under MOL 768.27a remains subject to MRE 403 gives rise to the question of proper application. As with any balancing test, MRE 403 involves two sides of a scale \u2014 a probative side and a prejudicial side. Propensity evidence is prejudicial by nature, and it is precisely the danger of prejudice that underlies the ban on propensity evidence in MRE 404(b). Yet were a court to apply MRE 403 in such a way that other-acts evidence in cases involving sexual misconduct against a minor was considered on the prejudicial side of the scale, this would gut the intended effect of MCL 768.27a, which is to allow juries to consider evidence of other acts the defendant committed to show the defendant\u2019s character and propensity to commit the charged crime. To weigh the propensity inference derived from other-acts evidence in cases involving sexual misconduct against a minor on the prejudicial side of the balancing test would be to resurrect MRE 404(b), which the Legislature rejected in MCL 768.27a.</p>\n<p id=\"b603-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>Accordingly, when applying MRE 403 to evidence admissible under MCL 768.27a, courts must weigh the propensity inference in favor of the evidence\u2019s probative value rather than its prejudicial effect. That is, other-acts evidence admissible under MCL 768.27a may not be excluded under MRE 403 as overly prejudicial merely because it allows a jury to draw a propensity inference. In reaching this conclusion, we join several federal courts that have addressed this issue with respect to FRE 414 and 403.<footnotemark>83</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">This does not mean, however, that other-acts evidence admissible under MCL 768.27a may never be excluded under MRE 403 as overly prejudicial. There are several considerations that may lead a court to exclude such evidence. These considerations include (1) the dissimilarity between the other acts and the charged crime, (2) the temporal proximity of the other acts to the charged crime, (3) the infrequency of the other acts, (4) the presence of intervening acts, (5) the lack of reliability of the evidence supporting the occurrence of the other acts, and (6) the lack of need for evidence beyond the complainant\u2019s and the defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>testimony.<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> This list of considerations is meant to be illustrative rather than exhaustive.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-4\">Several of these considerations are challenged in this appeal. Regarding the decision whether to exclude evidence admissible under MCL 768.27a when applying MRE 403, it is argued that courts should not be permitted to consider how long ago the other act occurred, its dissimilarity to the charged offense, or the fact that the defendant was never convicted of the other act. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">Although MCL 768.27b expressly imposes a 10-year hmitation on the admissibility of other-acts evidence in domestic violence cases, whereas MCL 768.27a provides no such hmitation, there is simply no legal basis for concluding that the lack of a temporal hmitation in MCL 768.27a somehow means that the length of time since the other act of sexual misconduct against a minor occurred cannot be considered when weighing prejudice under MRE 403. Just as the statute\u2019s failure to refer to MRE 403 did not bar the court rule\u2019s apphcation, the failure to temporally limit the admissibility of other-acts evidence does not preclude a court from considering under MRE 403 how long ago the other act occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">The argument that the dissimilarity of the other-acts evidence and the charged offense should not be considered under MRE 403 similarly fails. Although MCL 768.27a, by its terms, applies to all listed offenses, there is no indication that the Legislature intended to suggest that all listed offenses are sufficiently similar to each other that the dissimilarity between them and the charged offense could never be weighed in favor of concluding that the other-acts evidence presents the danger of unfair prejudice under MRE 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>Finally, it is argued that, because MCL 768.27a applies to more than conduct that resulted in a conviction, whether the evidence of the other act resulted in a conviction is irrelevant under MRE 403. We disagree. That MCL 768.27a <em>permits </em>the introduction of other-acts evidence that did not result in a conviction does not mean that evidence that did not result in a conviction <em>must </em>be admitted or that a court may not consider whether charges were filed or a conviction rendered when weighing the evidence under MRE 403.<footnotemark>85</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">The foregoing considerations may be used by trial courts to determine whether the probative value of evidence admissible under MCL 768.27a \u2014 which includes the propensity inference derived from the other-acts evidence \u2014 is nonetheless outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. Trial courts should apply this balancing to each separate piece of evidence offered under MCL 768.27a. In addition, trial courts retain their discretion under MRE 403 to determine how many separate pieces of other-acts evidence may be admitted before the probative value of such evidence is outweighed by the danger of \u201cconfusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\u201d<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> This determination can only be made in the context of the entire trial, considering all the other-acts evidence offered under MCL 768.27a as well as the evidence as a whole. There is no bright-line rule for how many \u201cother acts\u201d may be admitted before the scale tips in favor of exclusion. Rather, ensuring that the proba<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>tive value of other-acts evidence is not outweighed by the danger of \u201cconfusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence\u201d is a responsibility left to the trial court\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-4\">A final tool available for trial courts when admitting other-acts evidence under MCL 768.27a is CJI2d 20.28a, the standard instruction on evidence of other acts of child sexual abuse:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-5\">(1) The prosecution has introduced evidence of claimed acts of sexual misconduct by the defendant with [a minor / minors] for which [he / she] is not on trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-6\">(2) Before you may consider such alleged acts as evidence against the defendant, you must first find that the defendant actually committed those acts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-7\">(3) If you find that the defendant did commit those acts, you may consider them in deciding if the defendant committed the [offense / offenses] for which [he / she] is now on trial.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b606-8\">(4) You must not convict the defendant here solely because you think [he / she] is guilty of other bad conduct. The evidence must convince you beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant committed the alleged crime, or you must find [him / her] not guilty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b606-9\">In cases in which a trial court determines that MRE 403 does not prevent the admission of other-acts evidence under MCL 768.27a, this instruction is available to ensure that the jury properly employs that evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b606-10\">IV APPLICATION</p>\n<p id=\"A69\">A. DOCKET NO. 142031</p>\n<p id=\"b606-11\">In Docket No. 142031, at Watkins\u2019s third and final trial, the trial court permitted EW to testify regarding other acts of alleged criminal sexual conduct and their surrounding circumstances. On appeal, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>Court of Appeals properly confirmed its earlier holding that MCL 768.27a conflicts with MRE 404(b) and that the statute prevails over the rule of evidence.<footnotemark>87</footnotemark> It also properly held that evidence admissible under MCL 768.27a remains subject to MRE 403.<footnotemark>88</footnotemark> Further, we agree with the Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion that the trial court\u2019s failure to apply MRE 403 was harmless. In addition to being probative because of the propensity inference, the other-acts evidence also supported the victim\u2019s credibility, presented circumstances similar to those underlying the charged offense, and established Watkins\u2019s modus operandi. And although the trial court failed to determine which aspects of EW\u2019s testimony met the requirements of MCL 768.27a, we agree with the Court of Appeals that the only incident for which EW provided specific details met the statute\u2019s requirements and, therefore, any error in admitting all of EW\u2019s testimony \u201cwas not inconsistent with substantial justice.\u201d<footnotemark>89</footnotemark> Finally, in accordance with CJI2d 20.28a, the jury was instructed on how to properly use the other-acts evidence. Accordingly, we affirm in <em>Watkins.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b607-5\">B. DOCKET NO. 142751</p>\n<p id=\"b607-6\">In Docket No. 142751, the trial court granted Pullen\u2019s motion in limine, excluding a 1989 police report containing allegations that Pullen had sexually abused his daughter more than 20 years ago. Although the trial court properly concluded that evidence admissible under MCL 768.27a remains subject to MRE 403, it abused its discretion by misapplying MRE 403.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>First, the trial court failed to weigh the propensity inference in favor of the evidence\u2019s probative value. Nowhere in its analysis did the trial court mention that the other-acts evidence was probative of Pullen\u2019s character or propensity to commit the charged offense. Instead, the court stated that, \u201c[s]hould this evidence be presented to the jury, it is highly probable that the jury would not be able to separate the two cases and would likely decide the case based on emotional impact rather than logical reasons.\u201d The Court of Appeals affirmed, characterizing this flawed reasoning as having \u201cprovided a reasoned basis\u201d for the trial court\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>90</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b608-4\">Second, the trial court failed to weigh in favor of the evidence\u2019s probative value the extent to which the other-acts evidence supported the victim\u2019s credibility and rebutted the defense\u2019s attack thereof.<footnotemark>91</footnotemark> Pullen admitted that his trial strategy was to attack the victim\u2019s credibility, and the other-acts evidence was highly probative for rebuttal purposes and tended to support the victim\u2019s credibility.<footnotemark>92</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b609-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>Third, the trial court failed to review separately under MRE 403 each act alleged in the 1989 report and instead lumped all of the evidence together. The trial court apparently believed that the egregiousness of some of the other-acts evidence \u2014 e.g., the allegation made by Pullen\u2019s daughter that he \u201cchecked if [she] was still a virgin\u201d \u2014 -justified excluding all the other-acts evidence as overly prejudicial. The various acts revealed in the 1989 report included digital penetration, unwelcome and inappropriate touching, and indecent exposure. The trial court should have considered each act separately.<footnotemark>93</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b610-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>Finally, the evidence of indecent exposure at issue here did not qualify as a listed offense under MCL 768.27a at times relevant to the instant case and, therefore, its admissibility should have been analyzed under MRE 404(b). The offense of aggravated indecent exposure is set forth at MCL 750.335a.<footnotemark>94</footnotemark> Currently, \u00a7 2 of the Sex Offenders Registration Act (SORA), MCL 28.721 <em>et seq., </em>defines \u201clisted offense\u201d as including \u201c[a] violation of [MCL 750.335a(2)(b)] ... if a victim is a minor.\u201d<footnotemark>95</footnotemark> At times relevant to this case, however, \u00a7 2 of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"495\">*495</page-number>SORA defined \u201clisted offense\u201d to mean \u201c[a] violation of [MCL 750.335a(2)(b)] . . . <em>if that individual was previously convicted of violating [MCL 750.335a].\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>96</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Pullen was never convicted of violating MCL 750.335a for exposing himself to his daughter more than 20 years ago, as alleged in the 1989 police report. Indeed, criminal charges were never filed. Because the evidence was not a listed offense under SORA and hence not admissible as a listed offense under MCL 768.27a, the trial court should have analyzed its admissibility under MRE 404(b).<footnotemark>97</footnotemark> Accordingly, we vacate the judgments of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>lower courts in <em>Pullen </em>and remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-6\">V CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b612-7\">In conclusion, we hold that MCL 768.27a irreconcilably conflicts with MRE 404(b) and that the statute prevails over the court rule. We also hold that evidence admissible under MCL 768.27a remains subject to MRE 403, but that courts must weigh the propensity inference in favor of the evidence\u2019s probative value rather than its prejudicial effect. For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment in <em>Watkins, </em>Docket No. 142031, vacate the judgments of the lower courts in <em>Pullen, </em>Docket No. 142751, and remand the latter case to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b612-8\">Young, C.J., and Markman and Mary Beth Kelly, JJ., concurred with ZAHRA, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b571-10\"> \u201c \u2018Listed offense\u2019 means that term as defined in section 2 of the sex offenders registration act, 1994 PA 295, MCL 28.722.\u201d MCL 768.27a(2)(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b572-8\"> Given this conclusion, we need not address whether, if evidence admissible under MCL 768.27a were <em>not </em>subject to MRE 403, the statute would violate a defendant\u2019s due-process right to a fair trial or interfere with the judicial power to ensure that a criminal defendant receives a fair trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b572-9\"> MCL 750.520b(l)(a) (involving a person under the age of 13).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b572-10\"> MCL 750.520c(l)(a) (involving a person under the age of 13).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[5]\">\n<p id=\"b573-6\">5 <em>People v Watkins, </em>277 Mich App 358, 360; 745 NW2d 149 (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b573-7\"> MRE 404(b)(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-8\">Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.

This case is distinguishable because it involved the admissibility of other-acts evidence under MCL 768.27a. In <em>Sabin, </em>for example, the reason for disallowing the admission of other-acts evidence under MRE 404(b) to bolster the complainant\u2019s credibility was that the resulting inference essentially involved propensity. As explained in <em>People v Oliphant, </em>399 Mich 472, 517; 250 NW2d 443 (1976):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-8\">Other allegations of rape do tend to make the complainant\u2019s story more believable, not because we know more about her or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>Oliphant\u2019s tendency to tell the truth, but because such evidence gives us reason to believe that he is the kind of man who would commit the charged offense. That, however, is precisely the purpose for which this evidence may not be admitted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b609-7\">Stated differently, the danger in admitting other-acts evidence to bolster the complainant\u2019s credibility is that it essentially invites the jury to draw a propensity inference. As we concluded in part 111(A) of this opinion, however, MCL 768.27a specifically <em>permits </em>the use of other-acts evidence to show a defendant\u2019s propensity to commit the charged crime. Because propensity evidence tends to make the complainant\u2019s story more believable, it would not make sense to conclude that evidence admissible to show the defendant\u2019s propensity to commit the charged offense is inadmissible to bolster the complainant\u2019s credibility. The defendant\u2019s propensity and the complainant\u2019s credibility are two sides of the same coin.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"93\">\n<p id=\"b609-8\"> Support for this conclusion exists in the language of MRE 403, which provides that \u201cevidence may be excluded if <em>its </em>probative value is substantially outweighed by the . .. <em>needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The rule thus contemplates the evaluation of an individual piece of evidence and how it compares to the other evidence sought to be admitted. This is not, as the dissent believes, a mere difference in judicial opinion. The dissent fails to cite any authority to support the proposition that the trial court did not err by lumping the other-acts evidence together for purposes of applying MRE 403. Rather than offer support for its own position, the dissent criticizes our analysis as selectively quoting MRE 403 by omitting all the language preceding \u201cneedless presentation of cumulative evidence,\u201d as if we have not considered the statute as a whole. Not so. Although, as the dissent observes, the \u201cneedless presentation of cumulative evidence\u201d is but one <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"494\">*494</page-number>basis for finding evidence excludable under MRE 403, the dissent does not explain how a trial court can consider this basis if it assesses the evidence when it is lumped together. The lumping of evidence leads to an all-or-nothing determination of admissibility; it does not leave room to determine a cumulative breaking point. Thus, unlike the dissent\u2019s position, our reading of MRE 403 adheres to the interpretive canon that \u201c[c]ourts must give effect to every word, phrase, and clause in a statute and avoid an interpretation that renders nugatory or surplusage any part of a statute.\u201d <em>People v Couzens, </em>480 Mich 240, 249; 747 NW2d 849 (2008) (citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"94\">\n<p id=\"b610-7\"> MCL 750.335a provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-8\">(1) A person shall not knowingly make any open or indecent exposure of his or her person or of the person of another.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-9\">(2) A person who violates subsection (1) is guilty of a crime, as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-10\">(a) Except as provided in subdivision (b) or (c), the person is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for not more than 1 year, or a fine of not more than $1,000.00, or both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-11\">(b) If the person was fondling his or her genitals, pubic area, buttocks, or, if the person is female, breasts, while violating subsection (1), the person is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment for not more than 2 years or a fine of not more than $2,000.00, or both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b610-12\">(c) If the person was at the time of the violation a sexually delinquent person, the violation is punishable by imprisonment for an indeterminate term, the minimum of which is 1 day and the maximum of which is life.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"95\">\n<p id=\"b610-13\"> MCL 28.722(k) and (s)(i\u00bf).

In part III(D), we explain that MRE 403 applies differently to evidence admissible under MCL 768.27a. The difference is that courts must weigh the propensity inference in favor of the evidence\u2019s probative value. Nonetheless, the dissent is correct in pointing out that because MRE 404(b) does not allow other-acts evidence to be admitted to show propensity, the evidence of indecent exposure may well be <em>less </em>probative under MRE 404(b) than under MCL 768.27a. However, this does not mean that \u201cthere is no basis for concluding that the trial court\u2019s MRE 403 balancing would come out differently.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 516. In this case, the inquiry of outcome-determinative error is complicated by the fact that the trial court improperly lumped all the evidence together for purposes of applying MRE 403. Just because the trial court applied MRE 403 to exclude <em>all </em>evidence contained in the 1989 police report that it believed was admissible under MCL 768.27a does not mean that it would have applied MRE 403 to exclude the evidence of indecent exposure had it properly considered its admissibility <em>separately </em>under MRE 404(b). This is the same reason for our reservations regarding the trial court\u2019s second basis for excluding the 1989 police report in its entirety, which was that \u201cit would be fundamentally unfair and a violation of due process to force [Pullen] to defend accusations from over 20 years ago for which charges were never filed.\u201d Although every piece of evidence contained in the report would be equally prejudicial on this basis if admitted, not every piece of evidence contained in the report would be equally probative if admitted. Given the varying probative values of the evidence contained in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>the report, in our view, the dissent\u2019s preference to affirm the judgments below would involve too much speculation.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b612-9\">Marilyn Kelly, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AkK\">(dissenting).

The <em>McDougall </em>majority held that this Court\u2019s authority over \u201cpractice and procedure\u201d did not include all matters relating to the admission of evidence.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Instead, it held that a legislatively created rule of evidence would not violate article 6, \u00a7 5 of the Michigan Constitution unless \u201c \u2018no clear legislative policy reflecting considerations other than judicial dispatch of litigation can be identified <footnotemark><em>10</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In sum, <em>McDougall </em>held that a substantive rule of evidence created by the Legislature prevails over a Court-created substantiye rule of evidence. <em>McDougall </em>also noted that \u201cthis Court is not authorized to enact court rules that establish, abrogate, or modify the substantive law.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b615-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>In <em>Pattison, </em>the Court of Appeals relied on <em>McDougall </em>and concluded that MCL 768.27a was a substantive, not a procedural, rule of evidence. As a result, <em>Pattison </em>held that the statute did not violate the separation of powers provision of the Michigan Constitution. The panel reasoned that the statute \u201cdoes not principally regulate the operation or administration of the courts,\u201d but instead \u201creflects the Legislature\u2019s policy decision that, in certain cases, juries should have the opportunity to weigh a defendant\u2019s behavioral history and view the case\u2019s facts in the larger context that the defendant\u2019s background affords.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\">MCL 768.27a VIOLATES THE SEPARATION OF POWERS PROVISION under <em>McDougall </em>when <em>McDougall </em>is correctly applied<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">MCL 768.27a should fail the <em>McDougall </em>test. The statute does not implement a \u201cclear legislative policy reflecting considerations other than judicial dispatch of litigation.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> To be sure, the statute may very well have been enacted to address legislative policy concerns; such a conclusion seems beyond dispute. The majority <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>identifies several public policy concerns supporting the Legislature\u2019s decision to enact MCL 768.27a. They include (1) the high rate of recidivism among child molesters, (2) the difficulty of obtaining evidence that secures convictions in child-molestation cases, and (3) the desire to further protect children from molestation.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">These are laudable public policy concerns. But their laudatory nature is irrelevant for purposes of this Court\u2019s analysis of the issue involved in this case. The Legislature\u2019s public policy considerations in enacting a statute can neither dictate nor disguise whether the statute enacted to address those considerations is a proper exercise of legislative authority.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b616-7\">The crucial question is not whether the <em>policy concerns themselves </em>are substantive. Rather, it is whether the <em>effect </em>of the statutory enactment changes substantive law. If the statute affects strictly procedural rather than substantive matters, that statute violates Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 5.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Contrary to the majority\u2019s conclusion, enacting MCL 768.27a to achieve the Legislature\u2019s policy goals does not, as the Constitution puts it, reflect considerations beyond the judicial dispatch of litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>When the Legislature enacted MCL 768.27a, the sole mechanism it used to achieve its policy concerns was to alter the standard under which other-acts evidence is admissible in court.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Thus, the relevant policy consideration that we must analyze is precisely that: Is the admission of previously inadmissible evidence in child-sex-abuse cases a substantive or a procedural issue?<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> This conclusion is consistent with our rule of statutory construction that \u201c[i]n determining the intent of the Legislature, this Court must first look to the language of the statute.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The majority\u2019s application of <em>McDougall </em>fails this principle by failing to look first at the statutory language.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-4\">\u201cIt is fundamental to American jurisprudence that \u2018a defendant must be tried for what he did, not for who he is.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> MRE 404(b) regulates how and when relevant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>evidence of a defendant\u2019s other crimes, wrongs, or acts may be admitted in court. As such, it is fundamentally procedural in nature because it concerns a matter that is solely within the province of the judiciary: the \u201cjudicial dispatch of litigation.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">It is also noteworthy that the Legislature\u2019s placement of MCL 768.27a supports my conclusion that MCL 768.27a is a procedural rule. MCL 768.27a is contained within the Code of Criminal Procedure,<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">The majority correctly observes that the statute \u201creflects a substantive legislative determination that juries should be privy to a defendant\u2019s behavioral history in cases charging the defendant with sexual misconduct against a minor.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> But this observation only makes my point. This observation is relevant not as a \u201csubstantive\u201d basis for the statute. Rather, it is relevant to demonstrate what the Legislature attempted to do by enacting it: to regulate the courts by telling them what evidence juries can hear. The course of action the Legislature prescribes to accomplish its policy goals in MCL 768.27a \u2014 telling courts how to operate \u2014 is a regulation of the judicial dispatch of litigation. It does nothing more. Simply put, the Legislature cannot \u201cmodify... the practice and procedure in all courts of this state.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b618-8\">The Washington Supreme Court very recently reached a similar conclusion and invalidated its state\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>similarly worded statute permitting the admission of propensity evidence in sexual abuse cases.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Relying on its inherent power to prescribe rules of \u201cprocedure and practice,\u201d the court reasoned that \u201cadmission of evidence in a criminal trial is generally a procedural matter.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The court invalidated the statute, all the while recognizing its stated purpose: \u201c \u2018to ensure that juries receive the necessary evidence to reach a just and fair verdict.. . .\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b619-4\">In another analogous case, the New Hampshire Supreme Court provided the following persuasive analysis:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-5\">Rule 404(b) is a prime example of an internal procedural rule designed to effectuate a constitutional right. .. . Rule 404(b) is simply a procedural means by which the fair trial right is secured. Giving deference to the legislature would, in this instance, abolish the rule\u2019s purpose and interfere with the judiciary\u2019s sound discretion in determining to what extent the rule serves its function in the circumstances of a particular case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b619-6\">Because the proposed bill directly conflicts with Rule 404(b), a rule concerning a uniquely judicial function, the separation of powers doctrine is violated. The legislature has no more right to break down the rules prescribed by this court to assure fundamental due process in criminal and civil trials than the court has to prescribe the mode and manner in which the legislature shall perform its legislative duties.<footnotemark>[28]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b620-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>In sum, when a statute\u2019s <em>only </em>function is to tell the courts what evidence they may admit in a court proceeding, the statute must give way to a conflicting court rule. MCL 768.27a is such a statute, and it conflicts with MRE 404(b). Accordingly, MCL 768.27a violates Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 5, and this Court should declare it null and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">My reasoning is not inconsistent with <em>McDougall, </em>nor would it restore the holding of <em>Perin v Peuler (On Rehearing)</em><footnotemark><em>29</em></footnotemark><em> </em>that <em>all </em>rules of evidence are procedural. Numerous authorities, including some cited by the <em>McDougall </em>majority, have identified evidentiary rules that are likely substantive declarations of policy outside the scope of the judiciary\u2019s rulemaking power.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> It is unsurprising that courts and commentators might identify these rules as substantive for reasons I have previously identified. These rules do far more than dictate what evidence is admissible in a court proceeding; they directly affect people\u2019s out-of-court behavior.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>The majority asserts that \u201cas a purely functional matter. .., all evidentiary rules tell the courts what evidence is admissible.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Noting my reference to privileges as possible substantive rules of evidence, the majority proclaims that \u201crules relating to privilege still serve the exclusive function of telling the courts what evidence is admissible at trial and, therefore, would be procedural under [my] test.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Not so. Most rules relating to privileges create a substantive right to confidentiality between parties such as doctors and patients,<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> attorneys and clients,<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> or clergy and penitents.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> These privileges exist independently from judicial proceedings. They also regulate courts by preserving confidentiality in the courtroom. That these privileges were created to exist outside the courtroom indicates the existence of a \u201clegislative policy reflecting considerations other than judicial dispatch of litigation . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>The function of these statutes is to create a substantive right, with an incidental effect on the admissibility of evidence in a court proceeding.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">The majority insists that my analysis would render Michigan\u2019s rape-shield statute<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> unconstitutional. It cites a Colorado Supreme Court case holding that that state\u2019s rape-shield statute did not violate its state constitution\u2019s separation of powers clause.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> There is a large problem with the majority\u2019s attempt to use this case to undermine my analysis. The Colorado Supreme Court specifically noted that its rape-shield statute had a \u201cmixed policy and procedural nature,\u201d and upheld it because of the \u201cabsence of any conflicting rule adopted by this court. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Thus, the Colorado Supreme Court strongly implied that it might very well have reached the opposite result had there been a conflicting court rule. By contrast, the decisions from the Supreme Courts of Washington, New Hampshire, and Tennessee cited in this opinion are persuasive and directly on point.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>In sum, MCL 768.27a differs from those rules that create, modify, or eliminate legal rights or duties. It exists <em>solely </em>to change the standard for the admission of evidence in a courtroom, a procedural matter solely within the province of the judiciary. For the reasons previously stated, I conclude that MCL 768.27a is a quintessential \u201cprocedural\u201d rule involving the \u201cdispatch of judicial business\u201d under <em>McDougall. </em>Because it conflicts with MRE 404(b) and regulates a matter of procedure, the Legislature overstepped its constitutional authority under Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 5 by enacting it.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b623-4\">THE MAJORITY ERRS BY RELYING ON <em>McDOUGALL </em>BECAUSE IT IS FUNDMENTALLY FLAWED AND NOT FAITHFUL TO THE AUTHORITIES ON WHICH IT RELIED</p>\n<p id=\"b623-5\">Unfortunately, the entire previous discussion regarding the proper application of <em>McDougall </em>amounts to much ado about nothing. This is so because, just as in <em>McDougall, </em>once any \u201cpolicy consideration\u201d is identified that supports the statute, our corresponding rule \u2014 should it conflict \u2014 becomes a nullity.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b624-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>The majority applies <em>McDougall </em>perfunctorily and concludes that MCL 768.27a prevails over MRE 404(b) because it is based on \u201cpolicy considerations \u2018over and beyond matters involving the orderly dispatch of judicial business\u2019 . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> As previously explained, the majority\u2019s conclusion is not a foregone one under <em>McDou</em>gall, nor is it in accord with the bulk of existing authority addressing this issue. Hence, because the majority reaches an incorrect result due to its flawed application of the <em>McDougall </em>test, I must address the validity of the <em>McDougall </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-4\">I conclude that the <em>McDougall </em>test for analyzing whether a statute is substantive or procedural (or, at a minimum, the majority\u2019s application of that test) is overly simplistic and underinclusive. Thus, I disagree with the majority\u2019s assertion that <em>McDougall </em>\u201cestablished a sensible approach to separate procedural rules of evidence ... from substantive rules of evidence ... .\u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> The test should be either refined or discarded because it is not consistent with the historical authority on which it purports to be based.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">First, the majority\u2019s application of <em>McDougall </em>is cursory. The majority takes a mere four paragraphs of analysis to support its conclusion that \u201cMCL 768.27a is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>a valid enactment of substantive law. .. .\u201d<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> That the <em>McDougall </em>test allows for such brevity of analysis in resolving this issue is a liability, not an asset. The substance/procedure divide is a far thornier question than the majority\u2019s application of <em>McDougall </em>acknowledges. Other courts, as well as many commentators, have recognized and readily conceded this tension.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> Indeed, even the <em>McDougall </em>majority acknowledged it.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> But that prescient acknowledgment dies a quick death at the hands of this majority, given that its substance/procedure analysis begins with shovel in hand and a six-foot-deep hole. Its analysis is as effortless as it is superficial.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-4\">Second, the <em>McDougall </em>test as applied is also vastly underinclusive in defining what rules qualify as procedural.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Nor is it faithful to the authority on which it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>purports to be grounded. The language \u201corderly dispatch of judicial business\u201d and \u201cpublic policy, having as its basis something other than court administration\u201d seized on in <em>McDougall </em>lacks the proper context and is grossly overstated. The authors of the law review article that articulated this language themselves recognized as much.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> One authority on which the <em>McDougall </em>majority relied said that rules of \u201cpractice\u201d include those that \u201cprescribe the methodology for initiating, conducting, and concluding litigation . . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> Another authority that the <em>McDougall </em>majority cited identified procedural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>rules as those \u201cbased upon policies concerned with the reliability or relevance of proof or the orderly dispatch of judicial business.\u201d<footnotemark>54</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">The <em>McDougall </em>test also ignores that the vast majority of courts and commentators, again <em>including those relied on by the </em>McDougall majority, have concluded that most rules of evidence are procedural.<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> Thus, the majority\u2019s attempt to counter my criticism of the <em>Mc-Dougall </em>test as \u201cvastly underinclusive\u201d by calling my approach \u201cvastly overinclusive\u201d is unavailing.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> <em>McDou</em>gall\u2019s sharply limited \u201cjudicial dispatch of business\u201d test, at least as applied, invites the Legislature to supersede most of the Michigan Rules of Evidence. Under <em>McDougall, </em>nearly every rule can be characterized as substantive.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">Finally, the <em>McDougall </em>test gives the Legislature license to intrude with impunity into the province of the judiciary provided that it divines a \u201csubstantive\u201d label for its statutory enactments.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> This is so irrespective of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>whether that which the statute accomplishes is substantive or procedural. Surely the delegates involved in crafting article 6, \u00a7 5 did not intend to allow the Legislature to neuter this Court\u2019s authority to regulate \u201cpractice and procedure\u201d in this fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">For all these reasons, I conclude that the <em>McDougall </em>test for resolving the substance/procedure question is fundamentally flawed. At a minimum, the majority\u2019s mechanical application of it demonstrates how inadequate it is to resolve the difficult questions presented by cases such as this. I would refine the test in the manner described in this opinion if the test cannot be discarded altogether, because the majority appears unwilling or unable to apply it consistently with its intellectual genesis.<footnotemark>59</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">MCL 768.27a AND MRE 403</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">Because I would strike down MCL 768.27a as unconstitutional, it is unnecessary for me to reach the qu.es<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>tion of how MCL 768.27a and MRE 403 interact. Other-acts evidence admitted pursuant to MRE 404(b) is indisputably subject to balancing under MRE 403. Thus, I do not reach the issues discussed in parts III(C) and (D) of the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\">APPLICATION</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">I would hold that MCL 768.27a is an unconstitutional violation of the separation of powers provision set forth in Const 1963, art 6, \u00a7 5. In <em>Watkins, </em>the Court of Appeals erroneously concluded that the statute did not violate the separation of powers and that much of the evidence against Watkins had been properly admitted under MCL 768.27a. Therefore, I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand <em>Watkins </em>for a new trial. I would direct the trial court to use MRE 404(b) and MRE 403 on remand to evaluate the admissibility of the other-acts evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">In <em>Pullen, </em>I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals. Although the trial court erred by concluding that the other-acts evidence was admissible under MCL 768.27a, the error was harmless because the court excluded the evidence under MRE 403. \u201cRule 403 determinations are best left to a contemporaneous assessment of the presentation, credibility, and effect of testimony\u201d by the trial court.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> In this case, the trial court\u2019s decision to exclude the evidence was within the range of principled outcomes and, therefore, not an abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>61</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">The majority identifies four purported flaws in the <em>Pullen </em>trial court\u2019s application of MRE 403. I disagree <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>with each analysis. With respect to the first two, as previously noted, I would conclude that MCL 768.27a is unconstitutional. Thus, I need not reach the question of whether MRE 403 would apply differently to evidence admitted under the statute rather than under MRE 404(b). Other-acts evidence is admissible only under MRE 404(b), which does not allow its admission to show that a defendant had a propensity to commit the charged offenses.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark> Hence, the other-acts evidence in <em>Pullen </em>was not admissible for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">Because the evidence was not admissible to show propensity, the trial court did not err by \u201cfailfing] to weigh the propensity inference in favor of the evidence\u2019s probative value.\u201d<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> Nor was it required to \u201cweigh in favor of the evidence\u2019s probative value the extent to which the other-acts evidence supported the victim\u2019s credibility and rebutted the defense\u2019s attack thereof.\u201d<footnotemark>64</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">Next, I question the majority\u2019s criticism that the trial court \u201clumped\u201d together all the other-acts evidence rather than considering each act separately. Neither the majority nor the prosecution cites any authority to support the proposition that a trial court must consider each other act separately when conducting an MRE 403 analysis.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> Consequently, I see no basis for concluding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>that the trial court made a legal error in this respect. For this reason, I believe the majority\u2019s decision otherwise violates our often stated rule that \u201c[a]n abuse of discretion involves far more than a difference injudicial opinion.\u201d<footnotemark>66</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b631-4\">Finally, the majority remands for further proceedings for the trial court to consider whether evidence of Pullen\u2019s previous indecent exposure is admissible under MRE 404(b). I fail to see how the trial court can apply MRE 403 to that evidence differently if it is admitted under MRE 404(b) rather than under MCL 768.27a.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> Under either avenue of admissibility, MRE 403 requires exclusion if, among other things, the evidence\u2019s \u201cprobative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>68</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">On remand, evidence of the prior indecent exposure may be admitted only under MRE 404(b). MRE 404(b) does not allow other-acts evidence to be admitted to show propensity or bad character. Therefore, if anything, the prior-indecent-exposure evidence will have <em>less </em>probative value under MRE 404(b) than it did when the trial court evaluated it under MCL 768.27a. Moreover, MRE 403 continues to apply with full force to that evidence. Conse<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>quently, there is no basis for concluding that the trial court\u2019s MRE 403 balancing would come out differently.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">The majority also summarily dismisses the trial court\u2019s second stated basis for finding the other-acts evidence unfairly prejudicial to Pullen. After concluding that the other-acts evidence would be \u201chighly probable\u201d to prejudice the jury, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b632-5\">The Court also finds that it would be fundamentally unfair and a violation of due process to force [Pullen] to defend accusations from over 20 years ago for which charges were never filed. [Pullen] is in an untenable position to try to disprove more serious and greatly dated charges. It is unlikely that he would be able to do so, and to require him to do so would be manifestly unjust.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">The majority does not explain how this alternative basis for excluding the other-acts evidence also constituted an abuse of discretion. Instead, it suggests that the evidence in the 1989 police report alleging sexual abuse of Pullen\u2019s daughter, while \u201cequally prejudicial on this basis,\u201d has \u201cvarying probative values.\u201d<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> How is this relevant? Whether the introduction of 20-year-old evidence is \u201cfundamentally unfair\u201d and \u201cmanifestly unjust\u201d has nothing to do with its probative value, and everything to do with its prejudicial effect. The trial court\u2019s conclusion was inherently a determination that <em>whatever </em>the evidence\u2019s probative value, it would be outweighed by its prejudicial effect and violate Pullen\u2019s rights. Thus, that the evidence may have \u201cvarying probative values\u201d does nothing to undermine the trial court\u2019s ruling in this context.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">Accordingly, I am not convinced that the <em>Pullen </em>trial court abused its discretion in conducting its MRE 403 balancing. I would affirm the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b633-4\">I agree with the majority that MCL 768.27a and MRE 404(b) irreconcilably conflict. However, I dissent from the majority\u2019s conclusion that MCL 768.27a prevails over MRE 404(b).

However, it is the majority, in making new law on this point, that bears the burden of providing authority. It attempts to rely on the language of MRE 403, but that reliance is dubious. First, one can just as easily read MRE 403 as providing that <em>\u201c[all </em>other-acts] evidence may he excluded if <em>its </em>probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice .. . .\u201d (Emphasis added.) Second, the majority selectively quotes the rule by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>omitting all the language preceding \u201cneedless presentation of cumulative evidence\u201d to holster its conclusion that the rule\u2019s language supports its conclusion. But the \u201cneedless presentation of cumulative evidence\u201d is hut <em>one </em>basis for finding the evidence excludable.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"66\">\n<p id=\"b631-7\"> <em>Alken-Ziegler, Inc v Waterbury Headers Corp, </em>461 Mich 219, 227; 600 NW2d 638 (1999), citing <em>Williams v Hofley Mfg Co, </em>430 Mich 603, 619; 424 NW2d 278 (1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"67\">\n<p id=\"b631-8\"> The majority also appears to suggest that the MRE 403 balancing would come out differently because the trial court would evaluate the evidence of the indecent exposure independently of the other-acts evidence. I disagree that reevaluation is necessary because, as previously noted, I do not agree with the majority that the trial court improperly \u201clumped\u201d together the other-acts evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"68\">\n<p id=\"Au8\"> MRE 403.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"69\">\n<p id=\"b632-8\"><em> Ante </em>at 495-496 n 97.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
