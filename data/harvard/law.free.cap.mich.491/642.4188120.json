FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b762-5\">On the night of June 14, 2002, defendant, Joseph Lashawn Vaughn, parked his car on a Detroit street so that it partially blocked the driveway of Emmitt Smith, a retired police officer. Smith and a neighbor went over to the car, which defendant had exited, and began talking to a woman in the passenger seat of the car. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>Defendant then emerged from a nearby alley and began shooting at Smith and the neighbor. In response, Smith returned fire, although defendant ran from the scene. Police traced the parked vehicle to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-5\">Defendant was arrested and charged with possession of a firearm by a felon (felon-in-possession),<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> possession of a firearm in the commission of a felony (felony-firearm),<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and two counts of assault with intent to murder.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> He proceeded to a jury trial in the Wayne Circuit Court. After the circuit court discussed a preliminary matter with counsel of record, a court officer closed the courtroom in preparation for voir dire:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-6\"><em>The Court: </em>All right, we\u2019ll bring the jury in.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b763-7\"><em>Court Officer: </em>Okay, folks you\u2019re going to have to clear the courtroom until after the selection of the new jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b763-8\">Although the record is unclear regarding how many people were subject to the court\u2019s order, it is uncontested that the circuit court did not provide a reason for this closure. It is also uncontested that neither defendant nor his counsel objected to closure of the courtroom.</p>\n<p id=\"b763-9\">At the conclusion of defendant\u2019s trial, the jury found defendant guilty of felon-in-possession, felony-firearm, and two counts of assault with intent to commit great bodily harm less than murder.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Defendant raised several claims of error on appeal, among them that the circuit court\u2019s closure of the courtroom during voir dire violated his Sixth Amendment right to a public trial and entitled him to a new trial. Alternatively, defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>claimed that his trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to the circuit court\u2019s closure of the courtroom constituted ineffective assistance of counsel and likewise entitled him to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b764-5\">The Court of Appeals unanimously affirmed defendant\u2019s convictions.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals panel explained that while a defendant has \u201cthe right to have the courtroom open to the public during jury voir dire[,] . . . this right is not self-executing [and] the defendant must timely assert the right.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Accordingly, \u201cthe failure to timely assert the right to a public trial forecloses the later grant of relief.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Because \u201cdefendant\u2019s trial counsel did not object to the trial court\u2019s decision to close the courtroom to the public during the selection of his jury,\u201d the courtroom\u2019s closure \u201cdoes not warrant relief.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b764-6\">The Court of Appeals also determined that defendant was not entitled to relief on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel because he could not show \u201cthat his trial counsel\u2019s decision not to object fell below an objective standard of reasonableness under prevailing professional norms . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> It explained that \u201c[d]efendant\u2019s trial counsel might have reasonably concluded that proceeding with a jury voir dire that was closed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>the public benefitted defendant\u201d because a reasonable trial counsel might determine \u201cthat the potential jurors will be more forthcoming in their responses when the courtroom is closed, that the proceedings will be less likely to be tainted by outside influences, or . . . [that] it will expedite the proceedings.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b765-5\">This Court granted defendant\u2019s application for leave to appeal, limited to the following issues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-6\">(1) whether the defendant was denied his right to a public trial pursuant to US Const, Am VI, and Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 20, where the Wayne Circuit Court excluded persons other than jurors from the courtroom during the jury voir dire, see <em>Presley v Georgia, </em>558 US 209; 130 S Ct 721; 175 L Ed 2d 675 (2010); (2) whether the defendant, by failing to object, forfeited or waived any error resulting from the exclusion of the public from the courtroom during the jury voir dire, and, if so, whether trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance in failing to object; (3) whether, if some structural errors can be forfeited, the denial of the right to a public trial is among those forfeitable errors; and (4) whether the defendant is entitled to a new trial as a consequence of the trial court\u2019s exclusion of the public during the jury voir dire!<footnotemark>[16]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-7\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">Defendant claims that the circuit court violated his constitutional right to a public trial when it closed the courtroom during voir dire.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Alternatively, defendant claims that his trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to the courtroom\u2019s closure rendered the assistance of his counsel constitutionally deficient.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Whether the circuit court violated defendant\u2019s right to a public trial pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"650\">*650</page-number>sents a question of constitutional law.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Whether defendant was denied the effective assistance of counsel presents a mixed question of fact and constitutional law.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We review for clear error a circuit court\u2019s findings of fact.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We review de novo questions of constitutional law.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b766-6\">III. RIGHT TO A PUBLIC TRIAL</p>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">The right to a public trial \u201chas its roots in our English common law heritage.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> The Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution expressly enumerates this right and states that a criminal defendant \u201cshall enjoy the right to a.. . public trial.. . . \u201d The Sixth Amendment right to a public trial is incorporated to the states by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Additionally, article 1, \u00a7 20 of the 1963 Michigan Constitution guarantees that a criminal defendant \u201cshall have the right to a. . . public trial.... \u201d<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> That the right to a public trial also encom<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>passes the right to public voir dire proceedings is \u201cwell <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"652\">*652</page-number>settled. \u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b768-6\">Although the Sixth Amendment right \u201cis the right of the accused,\u201d a member of the public can invoke the right to a public trial under the First Amendment.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> \u201cThe extent to which the First and Sixth Amendment public trial rights are coextensive is an open question, and it is not necessary here to speculate whether or in what circumstances the reach or protections of one might be greater than the other.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The existence of this implied First Amendment right enjoyed by members of the public precludes a criminal defendant from enjoying a constitutional right to a <em>private </em>trial, even if he waives his Sixth Amendment right to a public trial.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Because this case involves \u201cthe <em>accused </em>who invoked his right to a public trial,\u201d albeit after the fact, this case proceeds solely under the Sixth Amendment.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b769-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>A defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to a public trial is limited, and there are circumstances that allow the closure of a courtroom during any stage of a criminal proceeding, even over a defendant\u2019s objection:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b769-5\">\u201c[T]he party seeking to close the hearing must advance an overriding interest that is likely to be prejudiced, the closure must be no broader than necessary to protect that interest, the trial court must consider reasonable alternatives to closing the proceeding, and it must make findings adequate to support the closure.\u201d<footnotemark>[31]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b769-6\">If there is a timely assertion of the Sixth Amendment public trial right, the remedy for a violation must be \u201cappropriate to the violation,\u201d although \u201cthe defendant should not be required to prove specific prejudice in order to obtain relief. . . ,\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b769-7\">Although the existence of the Sixth Amendment right to a public trial during voir dire is not questioned, neither this Court nor the Supreme Court of the United States has squarely considered whether the right can be forfeited or waived by a defendant\u2019s failure to assert the right in a timely fashion. We turn now to this question.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-8\">A. PRESERVATION OF RIGHT TO A PUBLIC TRIAL</p>\n<p id=\"b769-9\">This Court \u201chas long recognized the importance of preserving issues for appellate review.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> As a result, \u201c [t]his Court disfavors consideration of unpreserved claims of error,\u201d even unpreserved claims of constitu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>tional error.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> In <em>People v </em>Carines, this Court adopted the forfeiture standard articulated by the Supreme Court of the United States in <em>United States v Olano.</em><footnotemark><em>35</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Like this Court\u2019s jurisprudence, <em>Olano </em>reiterated the importance of asserting a constitutional right in a timely manner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-4\">\u201cNo procedural principle is more familiar to this Court than that a constitutional right,\u201d or a right of any other sort, \u201cmay be forfeited in criminal as well as civil cases by the failure to make timely assertion of the right before a tribunal having jurisdiction to determine it.\u201d<footnotemark>[36]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">Thus, the failure to assert a constitutional right ordinarily constitutes a forfeiture of that right.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> In analyzing a forfeited claim of error, a defendant is not entitled to relief unless he can establish (1) that the error occurred, (2) that the error was \u201cplain,\u201d (3) that the error affected substantial rights, and (4) that the error either resulted in the conviction of an actually innocent defendant or seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">Both parties assert that this Court should not follow the <em>Carines </em>forfeiture rule when examining a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to a public trial. We turn <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"655\">*655</page-number>first to defendant\u2019s claim that his Sixth Amendment public trial right is not a forfeitable right, but instead can only be abandoned with his personal and informed waiver of the right.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">\u201cWhat suffices for waiver depends on the nature of the right at issue.\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> Although the violation of the right to a public trial is among the limited class of constitutional violations that are structural in nature,<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> this fact alone does not require that the <em>waiver </em>of that right be personal and informed. Indeed, in <em>Johnson v United States, </em>the Supreme Court of the United States rejected the argument that <em>Olano </em>does not apply to a claimed structural error because it had \u201cno authority\u201d to create \u201cout of whole cloth\u201d an exception to the traditional forfeiture analysis simply because the claimed error was structural.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">We likewise decline to create such an exception for the right to a public trial. While certain constitutional rights are preserved absent a personal waiver,<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"656\">*656</page-number>rights constitute a narrow class of foundational constitutional rights that \u201care of central importance to the quality of the guilt-determining process and the defendant\u2019s ability to participate in that process.\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> Indeed, each of the foundational constitutional rights that are preserved absent a personal waiver necessarily implicates a defendant\u2019s <em>other </em>constitutional rights.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> For</p>\n<p id=\"b773-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"657\">*657</page-number>example, the purpose of the right to counsel \u201cwould be nullified by a determination that an accused\u2019s ignorant failure to claim his rights removes the protection of the Constitution\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> because it is counsel\u2019s responsibility to \u201cprotect an accused from conviction resulting from his own ignorance of his legal and constitutional rights . .. .\u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Because the right to counsel \u201cinvokes, of itself, the protection of a trial court,\u201d<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> preservation of the right does not require an affirmative invocation. Similarly, a waiver of the right to plead not guilty \u201cwould shut off the defendant\u2019s constitutional right to confront and cross-examine the witnesses against him which he would have an opportunity to do under a plea of not guilty.\u201d<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> The right to a public trial is \u201cof a different order\u201d because the violation of that right \u201cdoes not necessarily affect qualitatively the guilt-determining process or the defendant\u2019s ability to participate in the process.\u201d<footnotemark>49</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">Neither the Supreme Court of the United States nor this Court has held that the Sixth Amendment right to a public trial is so fundamental to the protection of a defendant\u2019s other constitutional rights that it falls within this exceedingly narrow class of rights that are placed outside the general preservation requirements and require a personal and informed waiver. Defendant cites two foreign appellate cases, <em>State v Njonge</em><footnotemark><em>50</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number><em>Commonwealth v Lavoie.</em><footnotemark><em>51</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Neither is persuasive. <em>Njonge </em>states that a criminal defendant may raise his public trial right \u201cfor the first time on appeal.\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> However, the underlying caselaw \u2014 a plurality opinion of the Washington Supreme Court \u2014 merely explained that a defendant\u2019s failure to object does not \u201cconstitute a waiver of his right to a public trial.\u201d<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> That statement did not address, much less compel, a personal and intelligent waiver.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> While <em>Lavoie </em>does stand for the proposition that a defendant\u2019s \u201cknowing agreement is required for the valid waiver of the right to a public trial,\u201d<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> neither <em>Lavoie </em>nor the cases it cited examined the right within the framework of the <em>other </em>rights that require a personal and knowing waiver. Accordingly, we do not find it persuasive in explaining <em>why </em>the right to a public trial is within the limited class of constitutional rights that require a waiver to be personal and knowing.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">Defendant also claims that a Sixth Amendment public trial right should be excepted from our traditional preservation rules because \u201cthe whole body politic,\u201d not just a criminal defendant, \u201csuffers an actual injury\u201d in the denial of the public trial right.<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> Defendant notes language in this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Detroit Free Press v Recorder\u2019s Court Judge </em>that posits that a defendant \u201ccannot waive his right to a public trial in absolute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"659\">*659</page-number>derogation of the public interest.\u201d<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> From this language, defendant argues that a defendant need not invoke his right to a public trial right in order to preserve it.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">Defendant\u2019s argument is problematic because it conflates his <em>Sixth Amendment </em>right to a public trial with the related, but distinct, <em>First Amendment </em>right that the public enjoys. It is true that a defendant cannot waive a public trial \u201cin <em>absolute </em>derogation of the public interest.\u201d<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> However, this \u201cderogation of the public interest\u201d only speaks to the fact that a defendant cannot waive the public\u2019s First Amendment right and <em>demand </em>a <em>private </em>trial. Thus, a defendant cannot affirmatively seek to exclude the public from his trial unless he can overcome the public\u2019s First Amendment right. That right exists separately from defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right, and its mere existence does not prevent this Court from enforcing its traditional rules of forfeiture and waiver when reviewing a defendant\u2019s claim that his Sixth Amendment right has been violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-6\">This Court\u2019s decision in <em>Detroit Free Press </em>failed to recognize the distinction between the separate but related First and Sixth Amendment rights. <em>Detroit Free Press </em>acknowledged that \u201c[fjrom a literal standpoint, the Sixth Amendment provides the right to a public trial to \u2018the accused,\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> and it observed that \u201c[t]he societal interests served by [the right to a public trial] are separate from and at times may be in opposition to the interests of the accused.\u201d<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> However, it also suggested that these societal interests are encompassed in the Sixth Amendment rather than the First Amend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"660\">*660</page-number>ment. For instance, it noted that \u201cthe Sixth Amendment has been held to implicate interests beyond those of the accused\u201d<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> and emphasized that the Sixth Amendment protections provided to the accused were not intended \u201cto denigrate the interests of the public which are at the root of the public-trial guarantee.\u201d<footnotemark>62</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">United States Supreme Court caselaw undermines the <em>Detroit Free Press </em>analysis to the extent that <em>Detroit Free Press </em>rooted the public\u2019s right to public trial proceedings in the Sixth Amendment instead of the First Amendment.<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> The <em>Detroit Free Press </em>decision was issued shortly after the Supreme Court issued <em>Richmond Newspapers, Inc v </em>Virginia,<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> which identified the public\u2019s right of access to trial proceedings as within the First Amendment.<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> Subsequently, in <em>Press-Enterprise </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"661\">*661</page-number>I, the Court clarified that whether voir dire must be open \u201cfocuses on First. . . Amendment values and the historical backdrop against which the First Amendment was enacted.\u201d<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> Similarly, when a defendant \u201crequested a <em>closed </em>preliminary hearing,\u201d the Court emphasized that \u201cthe right asserted here is that of the public under the First Amendment.\u201d<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> Because a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right exists separately from the public\u2019s First Amendment right, the existence of the public\u2019s First Amendment right simply has no bearing on whether to apply our forfeiture analysis to a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment claim, and the erroneous conflation of these rights by <em>Detroit Free Press </em>does not provide a basis for creating an exception to our traditional rules of forfeiture and waiver.<footnotemark>68</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b777-4\">Alternatively, the prosecution and the Attorney General (acting as amicus curiae) claim, and the Court of Appeals held, that a defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to a public trial is not self-executing and, therefore, the failure to assert the right at the time of closure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>results in the waiver of that right.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark> Indeed, many other jurisdictions have concluded that a defendant\u2019s public trial right is waived when it is not asserted contemporaneously with the courtroom\u2019s closure.<footnotemark>70</footnotemark> To support the conclusion that the right is waived by silence, the prosecution points to language in <em>United States v Levine, </em>wherein the Supreme Court of the United States observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b778-4\">Due regard generally for the public nature of the judicial process does not require disregard of the solid demands of the fair administration of justice in favor of a party who, at the appropriate time and acting under advice of counsel, saw no disregard of a right, but raises an abstract claim only as an afterthought on appeal.<footnotemark>[71]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b778-5\">Although <em>Levine </em>examined a defendant\u2019s right to open criminal contempt proceedings under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment,<footnotemark>72</footnotemark> a subsequent Supreme Court opinion, <em>Peretz v United States, </em>cited <em>Levine </em>in dictum for the proposition that the \u201cfailure to object to [the] closing of [the] courtroom is [a] waiver of [the] right to public trial.\u201d<footnotemark>73</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b779-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>We decline to follow the dictum of the Supreme Court of the United States because it conflates the concepts of waiver and forfeiture that we have historically recognized in Michigan. Both this Court and the Supreme Court of the United States have distinguished the failure to assert a right \u2014 forfeiture\u2014from the affirmative waiver of a right.<footnotemark>74</footnotemark> <em>Olano </em>explained that \u201c[w]aiver is different from forfeiture\u201d in that waiver is \u201cthe <em>\u2018intentional </em>relinquishment or abandonment of a known right.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>75</footnotemark> A defendant who waives a right extinguishes the underlying error and may not seek appellate review of a claimed violation of that right.<footnotemark>76</footnotemark> \u201cMere forfeiture, on the other hand, does not extinguish an \u2018error.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>77</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b779-4\">The prosecution and the Attorney General claim that we should adopt an exception to this traditional definition of \u201cforfeiture\u201d because any result other than a waiver will encourage defense counsel to withhold objection as an appellate parachute. However, this argument fails to take into consideration the heightened standard of review already applied to forfeited claims of error. <em>Carines </em>requires a defendant who has forfeited his claim of error to prove (1) that the error occurred, (2) that the error was \u201cplain,\u201d (3) that the error affected substantial rights, and (4) that the error either resulted in the conviction of an actually innocent defendant or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.<footnotemark>78</footnotemark> In other words, the prosecution and the Attorney General have not shown that the <em>Carines </em>forfeiture requirements permit an appellate parachute in this circumstance.<footnotemark>79</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">Because neither party has persuasively shown that this Court should deviate from the general <em>Carines </em>rule regarding forfeited constitutional error, we hold that <em>Carines </em>applies to defendant\u2019s forfeited claim that the trial court violated his Sixth Amendment public trial right. The Court of Appeals erred by concluding that defendant\u2019s failure to assert his Sixth Amendment right to a public trial <em>necessarily </em>\u201cforecloses the later grant of relief.\u201d<footnotemark>80</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b780-7\">B. APPLICATION</p>\n<p id=\"b780-8\">As stated, in order to receive relief on his forfeited claim of constitutional error, defendant must establish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>(1) that the error occurred, (2) that the error was \u201cplain,\u201d (3) that the error affected substantial rights, and (4) that the error either resulted in the conviction of an actually innocent defendant or seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.<footnotemark>81</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\">The first two prongs of the analysis are straightforward. In this case, the circuit court ordered the courtroom closed before voir dire. The Supreme Court of the United States has stated that the \u201c \u2018party seeking to close the hearing must advance an overriding interest that is likely to be prejudiced. . . .\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>82</footnotemark> Because the circuit court failed to advance that type of interest before closing the courtroom, we conclude that an error occurred.<footnotemark>83</footnotemark> We also conclude that the error was plain, that is, \u201cclear or obvious.\u201d<footnotemark>84</footnotemark> It is readily apparent from the record that the circuit court closed the courtroom during voir dire. It is also \u201cwell settled\u201d that the Sixth Amendment right to a public trial extends to voir dire.<footnotemark>85</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">The third <em>Carines </em>prong requires a defendant to show that the error \u201caffected substantial rights.\u201d<footnotemark>86</footnotemark> For this prong to be satisfied, <em>Olano </em>requires the error to have \u201caffected the outcome of the. . . proceedings.\u201d<footnotemark>87</footnotemark> Similarly, this Court has stated that \u201cthe proper interpretation of the term \u2018prejudice\u2019 in the context of issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>preservation for plain error may be equated with the longstanding state precedent of outcome determination.\u201d<footnotemark>88</footnotemark> Thus,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-4\">a plain, <em>unpreserved </em>error may not be considered by an appellate court for the first time on appeal unless the error could have been decisive of the outcome or unless it falls under the category of cases, yet to be clearly defined, where prejudice is presumed or reversal is automatic.<footnotemark>[89]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">While the Supreme Court of the United States has specifically reserved judgment on whether an unpreserved structural error automatically affects a defendant\u2019s substantial rights,<footnotemark>90</footnotemark> this Court\u2019s decision in <em>People v Duncan </em>has explained that structural errors \u201care intrinsically harmful, without regard to their effect on the outcome. .. .\u201d<footnotemark>91</footnotemark> Accordingly, our caselaw suggests that a plain structural error satisfies the third <em>Carines </em>prong.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">Nevertheless, even if defendant can show that the error satisfied the first three <em>Carines </em>requirements, we \u201cmust exercise . .. discretion\u201d and only grant defendant a new trial if the error \u201cresulted in the conviction of an actually innocent defendant\u201d or seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.<footnotemark>92</footnotemark> Although denial of the right to a public trial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>is a structural error,<footnotemark>93</footnotemark> it is still subject to this requirement.<footnotemark>94</footnotemark> While \u201cany error that is \u2018structural\u2019 is likely to have <em>an </em>effect on the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings,\u201d the plain-error analysis requires us to \u201cconsider whether an error \u2018seriously\u2019 affected those factors.\u201d<footnotemark>95</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b783-4\">The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has recognized that \u201cit does not follow that every temporary instance of unjustified exclusion of the public \u2014 no matter how brief or trivial, and no matter how inconsequential the proceedings that occurred during an unjustified closure \u2014 would require that a conviction be overturned.\u201d<footnotemark>96</footnotemark> While the Second Circuit\u2019s analysis \u201cdoes not dismiss a defendant\u2019s claim on the grounds that the defendant was guilty anyway or that he did not suffer \u2018prejudice\u2019 or \u2018specific injury,\u2019 \u201d it examines \u201cwhether the actions of the court and the effect that they had on the conduct of the trial deprived the defendant \u2014 whether otherwise innocent or guilty \u2014 of the protections conferred by the Sixth Amendment.\u201d<footnotemark>97</footnotemark> The goals sought by these protections include (1) ensuring a fair trial, (2) reminding the prosecution and court of their responsibility to the accused and the importance of their functions, (3) encouraging witnesses to come forward, and (4) discouraging perjury.<footnotemark>98</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">In reviewing the closure of a courtroom during the first day of jury selection, the Second Circuit determined that the third and fourth protected values were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>\u201cnot implicated by voir dire because no witnesses testified.\u201d<footnotemark>99</footnotemark> The Second Circuit then analyzed the remaining two protected values within the particular circumstances of the case before it and concluded that \u201climiting presence at the voir dire proceedings to only the attorneys, judge, defendant, and prospective jurors for one afternoon did not subvert these values.\u201d<footnotemark>100</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\">A review of the circuit court transcript during defendant\u2019s voir dire shows that both parties engaged in a vigorous voir dire process, that there were no objections to either party\u2019s peremptory challenges of potential jurors, and that each party expressed satisfaction with the ultimate jury chosen. Moreover, because \u201cthe <em>venire </em>is drawn from the public itself,\u201d individual veniremembers \u201cremain public witnesses during much of the <em>voir dire </em>proceedings, listening to the court\u2019s questions and observing the conduct of counsel, until such time as they are chosen for the jury, disqualified, or excused.\u201d<footnotemark>101</footnotemark> Thus, \u201cthe presence of the <em>venire </em>lessens the extent to which [the court\u2019s] closure implicates the defendant\u2019s public trial right because the venire, derived from and representative of the public, guarantees that the <em>voir dire </em>proceedings will be subject to a substantial degree of continued public review.\u201d<footnotemark>102</footnotemark> Because the closure of the courtroom was limited to a vigorous voir dire process that ultimately yielded a jury that satisfied both parties, we cannot conclude that the closure \u201cseriously <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"669\">*669</page-number>affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d<footnotemark>103</footnotemark> Defendant is not entitled to a new trial on the basis of his forfeited claim of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b785-5\">IV INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL</p>\n<p id=\"b785-6\">The Sixth Amendment also guarantees a criminal defendant\u2019s right \u201cto have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.\u201d<footnotemark>104</footnotemark> The Supreme Court of the United States has recognized that \u201c \u2018the right to counsel is the right to the effective assistance of counsel.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>105</footnotemark> The right to the effective assistance of counsel is incorporated to the states by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.<footnotemark>106</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b785-7\">In <em>Strickland v Washington, </em>the Supreme Court of the United States stated that in order to receive a new trial on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant must establish that \u201ccounsel\u2019s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness\u201d<footnotemark>107</footnotemark> and that \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d<footnotemark>108</footnotemark> Defendant claims that his counsel\u2019s failure to object to the court<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>room\u2019s closure during voir dire entitles him to a new trial on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-5\">A. DEFICIENT PERFORMANCE PRONG</p>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">Defense counsel should be \u201cstrongly presumed to have rendered adequate assistance and made all significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment.\u201d<footnotemark>109</footnotemark> The inquiry into whether counsel\u2019s performance was reasonable is an objective one and requires the reviewing court to \u201cdetermine whether, in light of all the circumstances, the identified acts or omissions were outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance.\u201d<footnotemark>110</footnotemark> This standard requires a reviewing court \u201cto affirmatively entertain the range of possible \u2018reasons . . . counsel may have had for proceeding as they did.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>111</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b786-7\">The Court of Appeals panel did just that in reviewing defendant\u2019s claim. The panel reasoned that \u201c[defendant\u2019s trial counsel might have reasonably concluded that proceeding with a jury voir dire that was closed to the public benefitted defendant\u201d because \u201c [reasonable trial counsel might conclude that the potential jurors will be more forthcoming in their responses when the courtroom is closed, that the proceedings will be less likely to be tainted by outside influences, or might simply find the procedure preferable because it will expedite the proceedings.\u201d<footnotemark>112</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b786-8\">The Court of Appeals\u2019 conclusion is consistent with the conclusion of the United States Court of Appeals for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"671\">*671</page-number>the First Circuit that when analyzing an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, \u201cthe strategic advantage that [defendant] received from the individual voir dire taking place in private cannot be ignored.\u201d<footnotemark>113</footnotemark> Accordingly, we agree with the Court of Appeals\u2019 analysis and its conclusion that defendant is not entitled to relief on his ineffective assistance of counsel claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">B. PREJUDICE PRONG</p>\n<p id=\"b787-6\">Even if defendant had shown that counsel\u2019s performance was objectively unreasonable, defendant cannot show that he is entitled to relief on the second <em>Strickland </em>prong, which requires this Court to determine whether \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d<footnotemark>114</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b787-7\">Defendant claims that a structural error automatically satisfies the second <em>Strickland </em>prong. However, <em>Strickland </em>and a companion case, <em>United States v Cronic, </em>articulated only a narrow class of situations in which prejudice is presumed for ineffective assistance purposes: \u201cwhen counsel was either totally absent, or prevented from assisting the accused during a critical stage of the proceeding\u201d<footnotemark>115</footnotemark> or \u201cwhen counsel is burdened by an actual conflict of interest.\u201d<footnotemark>116</footnotemark> Otherwise, \u201cactual ineffectiveness claims alleging a deficiency in attorney performance are subject to a general requirement that the defendant affirmatively prove prejudice\u201d because \u201c[t]he government is not responsible for, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"672\">*672</page-number>hence not able to prevent, attorney errors that will result in reversal of a conviction or sentence.\u201d<footnotemark>117</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">Although this Court has not yet ruled on the issue, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit and the Georgia and Utah Supreme Courts have held that an ineffective assistance of counsel claim premised on a structural public trial right violation still requires a defendant to demonstrate actual prejudice.<footnotemark>118</footnotemark> The Eleventh Circuit explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-7\">We cannot dispense with the prejudice requirement for attorney error of this type without defying the Supreme Court\u2019s clear holding that except in three limited circumstances, which are not present here, a defendant must show that any error his counsel committed \u201cactually had an adverse effect on the defense.\u201d [Strickland, 466 US at 693.] That means he must prove a reasonable probability of a different result.<footnotemark>[119]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b788-8\">The Eleventh Circuit elaborated on the concept of prejudice in applying that requirement to the case before it, which involved an ineffective assistance of counsel claim premised on the failure to object when the trial judge closed the courtroom for the victim\u2019s testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b788-9\">[Defendant] cannot show that an objection from his counsel would have caused the factfinder to have a reasonable doubt about his guilt. If counsel had objected in a timely fashion and had persuaded the trial judge not to partially close the courtroom, there is no reason to believe that would have changed the victim\u2019s testimony in a way which would have created a reasonable doubt in the jury\u2019s mind. The victim could just as well have been a more <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"673\">*673</page-number>sympathetic or credible witness if forced to testify publicly We do not know, and when we do not know the party with the burden loses, and here that party is [defendant].</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b789-5\">Against this logic [defendant] argues that an objection by his trial counsel would have preserved the issue for appeal and led to a reversal of his conviction, which would have been a different result from the affirmance that occurred. There are two flaws with this argument. One is its assumption that the trial judge would have overruled an objection if one had been made. There is as much reason to believe that pointing out the error of his ways to the trial judge would have caused him to mend those ways, thereby depriving [defendant] of the issue on appeal. The second and more fundamental flaw in this argument is that it focuses on the outcome of the appeal, not of the trial. The Supreme Court in <em>Strickland </em>told us that when the claimed error of counsel occurred at the guilt stage of a trial (instead of on appeal) we are to gauge prejudice against the outcome of the trial: whether there is a reasonable probability of a different result at trial, not on appeal.<footnotemark>[120]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">However, the United States Courts of Appeals for the First and Eighth Circuits have ruled that a structural error automatically satisfies the <em>Strickland </em>prejudice prong.<footnotemark>121</footnotemark> The First Circuit criticized the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s reasoning, explaining that its actual prejudice requirement \u201cis in tension with the Supreme Court\u2019s pronouncement that prejudice is presumed in cases of structural error not because the risk of prejudice is high, but because it is impossible to determine the extent of the prejudice.\u201d<footnotemark>122</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">We conclude that the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s reasoning and conclusion is more persuasive. Without distinguishing a properly preserved structural error for which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>reversal is required from an error claimed as ineffective assistance of counsel, counsel can harbor error as an appellate parachute by failing to object to the closure of trial, thereby depriving the trial court of the opportunity to correct the error at the time it occurs. Further, because this is not one of the three circumstances in which the Supreme Court of the United States has held that trial counsel\u2019s ineffective assistance automatically results in <em>Strickland </em>prejudice, we conclude that an ineffective assistance of counsel claim premised on either counsel\u2019s waiver of or failure to object to the Sixth Amendment right to a public trial requires a showing of actual prejudice before the defendant is entitled to relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">In this case, defendant does not claim that the courtroom\u2019s closure during voir dire affected the voir dire process and tainted the ultimate jury chosen. To the contrary, defense counsel actively participated in the voir dire process and expressed satisfaction with the composition of the jury and, thus, we must presume that the resulting jury was a fair and neutral fact-finder. Because defendant cannot show that \u201cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different,\u201d<footnotemark>123</footnotemark> he is not entitled to relief on his ineffective assistance of counsel claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b790-6\">V CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b790-7\">While a criminal defendant has the constitutional right to a public trial, that right is forfeited when no objection is made at the time of the courtroom\u2019s closure to members of the public. As a forfeited claim of constitutional error, it can be redressed if the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>shows that the court\u2019s exclusion of members of the public during voir dire was \u201ca plain error that affected substantial rights\u201d and that he either \u201cis actually innocent or the error seriously affected the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d<footnotemark>124</footnotemark> Because defendant has not made the required showing in this case, he is not entitled to a new trial on his forfeited claim of error. Nor is he entitled to a new trial on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel because he has not shown that his counsel\u2019s performance was objectively unreasonable or that there was a reasonable probability that any error affected the proceeding\u2019s outcome. Accordingly, we vacate the Court of Appeals\u2019 opinion to the extent it is inconsistent with this opinion, affirm on alternative grounds the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and affirm defendant\u2019s convictions.<footnotemark>125</footnotemark></p>\n<judges id=\"b791-5\">Markman, Mary Beth Kelly, and Zahra, JJ., concurred with Young, C.J.</judges>\n<p id=\"b791-6\">CAVANAGH, J. (concurring). I concur in the majority\u2019s result only. I agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that a violation of the right to a public trial, including the right to public voir dire, is structural error. <em>Neder v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number><em>United States, </em>527 US 1, 8; 119 S Ct 1827; 144 L Ed 2d 35 (1999); <em>Waller v Georgia, </em>467 US 39, 49-50; 104 S Ct 2210; 81 L Ed 2d 31 (1984); <em>Presley v Georgia, </em>558 US 209, 213; 130 S Ct 721; 175 L Ed 2d 675 (2010).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The majority also correctly notes that neither this Court nor the United States Supreme Court has directly considered whether a defendant can waive or forfeit the erroneous denial of the right to public voir dire. Finally, I agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the right to public voir dire is not subject to waiver by silence and that the Court of Appeals erred by concluding otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">Although I agree with the majority that a structural error occurred in this case, I do not agree with the majority that <em>Johnson v United States, </em>520 US 461; 117 S Ct 1544; 137 L Ed 2d 718 (1997), definitively established that some structural errors may be subject to a forfeiture analysis. <em>Johnson </em>applied plain-error review to the petitioner\u2019s argument that a structural error had occurred; however, <em>Johnson </em>reserved judgment on whether the error at issue was actually structural in nature. <em>Id. </em>at 468-469. Moreover, <em>Neder, </em>527 US at 8-10, interpreted <em>Johnson </em>as holding that the error was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>structural. Thus, I disagree with the majority that, by arguing in favor of automatic reversal, defendant in this case seeks an \u201cexception\u201d to the general rules for issue preservation. <em>Ante </em>at 655.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">Additionally, the majority misapplies this Court\u2019s opinion in <em>People v </em>Duncan, 462 Mich 47; 610 NW2d 551 (2000), in analyzing whether the structural error in this case requires automatic reversal. I think that <em>Duncan </em>must be closely considered at this step of the analysis, particularly <em>Duncan\u2019s </em>statement that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b793-6\">structural errors.. . are intrinsically harmful, without regard to their effect on the outcome, so as to require automatic reversal. Such an error necessarily renders unfair or unreliable the determining of guilt or innocence. ... [Structural errors deprive defendants of basic protections without which a criminal trial cannot reliably serve its function as a vehicle for determination of guilt or innocence. <em>[Id. </em>at 51-52 (citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">In my view, <em>Duncan </em>accurately explains the \u201cintrinsically harmful\u201d nature of most structural errors and, accordingly, whenever a structural error occurs, I believe the potential need for automatic reversal should be given close consideration, even if the error is unpreserved. The majority concedes that <em>Duncan </em>held that \u201c \u2018[structural errors . . . are intrinsically harmful,\u2019 \u201d but the majority claims that \u201cthis statement is consistent with applying our forfeiture rules . . . .\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 656 n 42. However, the majority ignores that <em>Duncan </em>also explained that intrinsically harmful structural errors \u201crequire <em>automatic reversal\u201d </em>when such an error \u201crenders unfair or unreliable the determining of guilt or innocence.\u201d <em>Duncan, </em>462 Mich at 51 (emphasis added). Similarly, the United States Supreme Court has explained that, although rare, some errors are structural \u201cand thus require[] automatic reversal.\u201d <em>Washington v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"678\">*678</page-number><em>Recuenco, </em>548 US 212, 218; 126 S Ct 2546; 165 L Ed 2d 466 (2006).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, because the error at issue in this case is structural, and structural errors are generally subject to automatic reversal, <em>Neder, </em>527 US at 8; <em>Washington, </em>548 US at 218,1 believe that there must be an \u201cexception\u201d in order to apply plain-error review in this case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">As the majority explains, denial of the right to public voir dire is a structural error, but the United States Supreme Court has not \u201csquarely considered whether the right [to public voir dire] can be forfeited . . . .\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 653. Thus, today we are faced with an issue of first impression in our state and one that has not yet been directly addressed by the United States Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"679\">*679</page-number>Considerable tension exists in the available caselaw regarding whether the denial of the right to a public trial requires automatic reversal. For example, several opinions from the United States Supreme Court appear to indicate that denial of the right to a public trial is structural error requiring automatic reversal. See, e.g., <em>Washington, </em>548 US at 218 (offering \u201cdenial of public trial\u201d as an example of \u201can error [that] is structural, and thus requires automatic reversal\u201d), citing <em>Waller, </em>467 US 39); and <em>Neder, </em>527 US at 8 (same). On the other hand, as the majority explains, several opinions that consider more directly the issue of an unpreserved claim of the denial of the right to public voir dire have applied plain-error review. See, e.g., <em>Barrows v United States, </em>15 A3d 673 (DC, 2011). And in <em>United States v Agosto-Vega, </em>617 F3d 541, 547-548 (CA 1, 2010), the court addressed a preserved claim of the denial of the right to public voir dire and held that a new trial was required. What is particularly notable about <em>AgostoVega </em>is that the court did not engage in a harmless-error analysis but instead apparently took the view that denial of the right to public voir dire falls into the class of errors that defy harmless-error analysis. <em>Id.; </em>see <em>Arizona v Fulminante, </em>499 US 279, 309-310; 111 S Ct 1246; 113 L Ed 2d 302 (1991) (explaining that some errors \u201cdefy analysis by \u2018harmless-error\u2019 standards\u201d). Agosto-Vega\u2019s approach seems to be supported by <em>United States v Gonzalez-Lopez, </em>548 US 140, 148-149; 126 S Ct 2557; 165 L Ed 2d 409 (2006), in which the United States Supreme Court identified the denial of the right to a public trial as a \u201cstructural defect\u201d that \u201cdef[ies] analysis by \u2018harmless-error\u2019 standards\u201d because a structural defect affects the \u201cframework within which the trial proceeds\u201d and is \u201cnot simply an error in the trial process itself.\u201d (Citation and quotation marks omitted.) Accordingly, I find it difficult to square the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>notion that the denial of public voir dire defies harmless-error standards and is thus subject to automatic reversal when preserved because the resulting harm is \u201cnecessarily unquantifiable and indeterminate,\u201d <em>Sullivan v Louisiana, </em>508 US 275, 282; 113 S Ct 2078; 124 L Ed 2d 182 (1993), but the same error is nevertheless subject to plain-error analysis when unpreserved.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">Despite this tension in the caselaw, I think that <em>Duncan </em>accurately tied the \u201cintrinsically harmful\u201d nature of structural errors to the effect of those errors on the reliability of the trial\u2019s determination of guilt or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>innocence. <em>Duncan, </em>462 Mich, at 51-52. As the United States Supreme Court explained in <em>Washington, </em>structural errors generally require automatic reversal because a structural error \u201c \u2018necessarily render[s] a criminal trial fundamentally unfair or an unreliable vehicle for determining guilt or innocence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Washington, </em>548 US at 218-219, quoting <em>Neder, </em>527 US at 9 (alteration in original). Accordingly, in the context of an unpreserved claim of a violation of the right to public voir dire, if it can be shown that the ultimate determination of guilt remains reliable, I agree with the majority that, under Michigan\u2019s current law, the error may be examined for plain error under <em>People v Carines, </em>460 Mich 750; 597 NW2d 130 (1999),<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> because \u201cthe remedy should be appropriate to the violation.\u201d <em>Waller, </em>467 US at 50.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b797-4\">As for the majority\u2019s application of the <em>Carines </em>plain-error factors, I agree that the first two prongs\u2014 that an error occurred and the error was plain \u2014 are clearly established in this case. As for the third prong, which requires a showing that the error \u201caffected <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>substantial rights,\u201d <em>Carines, </em>460 Mich at 763,1 believe that <em>Duncan </em>does more than merely \u201csuggest\u201d that plain structural error is prejudicial. Although \u201cthis Court and the United States Supreme Court have left open the possibility that there is a category of errors for which the third prong of the plain-error standard is automatically met,\u201d <em>People v Shafier, </em>483 Mich 205, 220 n 15; 768 NW2d 305 (2009), denial of the right to a public trial is an error that must be presumed prejudicial because \u201ca requirement that prejudice be shown \u2018would in most cases deprive [the defendant] of the [public-trial] guarantee, for it would be difficult to envisage a case in which he would have evidence available of specific injury,\u2019 \u201d <em>Waller, </em>467 US at 49 n 9, quoting <em>United States ex rel Bennett v Rundle, </em>419 F2d 599, 608 (CA 3, 1969) (alterations in original). Accordingly, \u201cthe defendant should not be required to prove specific prejudice in order to obtain relief for a violation of the public-trial guarantee.\u201d <em>Waller, </em>467 US at 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">Although I disagree with the majority\u2019s equivocal stance on the third prong of the plain-error test with regard to the denial of the right to public voir dire, my primary quarrel with the majority opinion is with the route it takes to support the conclusion that the error did not seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Carines, </em>460 Mich at 763. I do not agree that the presence of the venire is a proper consideration in gauging the final prong of the plain-error analysis. Although the veniremembers are members of the public, if that fact is relevant to the plain-error analysis of the structural error at issue in this case, the right to public voir dire guaranteed by <em>Presley, </em>558 US at 213, loses all meaning. Specifically, veniremembers will <em>always </em>be present during voir dire; therefore, under the majority\u2019s approach, the prosecution will <em>always </em>be able to argue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>that the error did not seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings independent of the defendant\u2019s innocence. <em>Carines, </em>460 Mich at 763. Moreover,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-5\">[t]he long-established tradition of open voir dire contemplates ensuring that members of the general public, <em>external to the judicial process, </em>have the opportunity to observe the proceedings. As the Supreme Court found in <em>Press-Enterprise </em>[Co <em>v Superior Court of California, Riverside Co, </em>464 US 501, 506-507; 104 S Ct 819; 78 L Ed 2d 629 (1984)], \u201cbeginning in the 16th century, jurors were selected <em>in </em>public,\u201d meaning that the doors of the \u201ctowne house\u201d or other \u201ccommon place\u201d were open to \u201cso many as will or can come so neare as to heare it.\u201d By contrast, a voir dire is neither \u201cpublic\u201d nor \u201copen\u201d if the only members of the public allowed to attend are those who, having received juror summonses, are required to be there and part of the judicial process itself. Indeed, if the presence of potential jurors were sufficient to \u201csafeguardG\u201d the values underlying the Sixth Amendment, it would seem that spectators could <em>always </em>be excluded. <em>[United States v Gupta, </em>650 F3d 863, 876 (CA 2, 2011) (Parker, J., dissenting) (citation omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">Thus, although the majority correctly rejects the prosecution\u2019s argument that the right to public voir dire is subject to waiver, by considering the presence of the venire, the majority\u2019s analysis risks essentially adopting the very rule that it purports to reject because a defendant will never be able satisfy the requirements to overcome forfeiture under the plain-error analysis.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>The majority contends that my concerns are merely overwrought hand wringing because, under the majority\u2019s approach, the venire\u2019s presence is not \u201cdispositive.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 668 n 102 (emphasis omitted). However, by considering the venire\u2019s presence at all, the majority places a heavy thumb on the delicate scales of justice. Indeed, because the venire will <em>always </em>be present during voir dire, the majority\u2019s approach will <em>always </em>weigh in favor of denying the defendant relief. Given the importance that the Framers placed on the right to a public trial, <em>Waller, </em>467 US at 49 n 9, I would not hamstring a defendant\u2019s efforts to vindicate that right by stacking the deck against the defendant before the analysis even begins.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">I agree with the majority, however, that concerns regarding the fairness, integrity, and public reputation of the voir dire process under the facts of this particular case are lessened by the fact that the circuit court transcript reveals that \u201cthere were no objections to either party\u2019s peremptory challenges of potential jurors, and that each party expressed satisfaction with the ultimate jury chosen.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 668-669. \u201cThe purpose of voir dire is to elicit enough information for development of a rational basis for excluding those who are not impartial from the jury. ... It is the only mechanism, and the only safeguard a defendant has, for ensuring the right to an impartial jury.\u201d <em>People v Tyburski, </em>445 Mich 606, 618; 518 NW2d 441 (1994) (lead opinion by MALLETT, J.). The public\u2019s involvement in the voir dire process assists in effectuating the purpose of voir dire, in part, because it allows the public to see that the defendant \u201cis fairly dealt with and not unjustly con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>demned\u201d via selection of an unbiased jury. <em>Waller, </em>467 US at 46 (citations and quotation marks omitted). Moreover, \u201cthe presence of interested spectators may keep [the defendant\u2019s] triers keenly alive to a sense of their responsibility and to the importance of their functions . . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations and quotation marks omitted). Although the transcript showing \u201ca vigorous voir dire process,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 668, does not satisfy these goals as well as the actual presence of observers, it does at least provide some assurance that the voir dire process served its purpose. Accordingly, when weighing the fourth plain-error prong in relation to the improper denial of the right to public voir dire, a court should rely most heavily on evidence indicating whether the purpose of voir dire was satisfied. If relevant evidence is not available, or if the court is left with serious concerns regarding whether the voir dire process served its purpose, the court should not hesitate to conclude that the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings were seriously affected and that a new trial is required.</p>\n<judges id=\"b801-6\">Marilyn Kelly and Hathaway, JJ., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b762-6\"> US Const, Am VI; Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 20.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b762-7\"> <em>People v Carines, </em>460 Mich 750; 597 NW2d 130 (1999).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b762-8\"> <em>People v Vaughn, </em>291 Mich App 183, 196; 804 NW2d 764 (2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b762-9\"><em> Carines, </em>460 Mich at 774.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b762-10\"> US Const, Am VI; Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 20; <em>Strickland v Washington, </em>466 US 668; 104 S Ct 2052; 80 L Ed 2d 674 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b763-10\"> MCL 750.224\u00cd.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b763-11\"> MCL 750.227b.

In determining whether the Michigan Constitution affords more expansive rights than the Constitution of the United States for identically worded phrases and provisions, we have observed that \u201can expansion of the Michigan Constitution beyond federal protections for identically worded phrases and provisions\u201d is appropriate only when \u201csuch protections [are] deeply rooted in the document.\u201d <em>People v Pickens, </em>446 Mich 298, 316; 521 NW2d 797 (1994). Of course, the interpretation of federal provisions by the Supreme Court of the United States is relevant to applying similarly worded provisions in the Michigan Constitution, but only to the extent that we believe the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation accurately conveys the original meaning of the Michigan Constitution. See <em>Harvey v Michigan, </em>469 Mich 1, 6 n 3; 664 NW2d 767 (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b767-7\">Defendant points to language in a previous opinion of this Court suggesting that the elective nature of judicial office \u201cadds a dimension to the societal interests involved\u201d in the public\u2019s \u201cconcern\u201d over criminal proceedings. <em>Detroit Free Press v Recorder\u2019s Court Judge, </em>409 Mich 364, 386; 294 NW2d 827 (1980). While there are societal interests in the fact that the people of Michigan have retained the right to elect their judicial officers, we reject the notion that these societal interests confer any greater, or lesser, constitutional protections than those guaranteed by the federal constitution. Indeed, the public interest in having criminal proceedings open is universal and simply does not depend on any particular judicial selection process. Whether judges are elected or appointed, the right to a public trial exists \u201cas a safeguard against <em>any </em>attempt to employ our courts as instruments of persecution.\u201d <em>Oliver, </em>333 US at 270 (emphasis added). Thus, defendant has not shown that an expansion of a defendant\u2019s protections beyond the rights accorded him under the Sixth Amendment is \u201cdeeply rooted\u201d in article 1, \u00a7 20 to such an extent that the people ratifying the 1963 Michigan Constitution understood the Michigan Constitution to afford greater protections than the Sixth Amendment.

The Court of Appeals concluded that these claims of error were without merit, and we deny defendant\u2019s application for leave to appeal on these remaining issues because we are not persuaded that the questions presented should be reviewed by this Court.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b792-6\"> Indeed, as the United States Supreme Court explained in Waller, 467 US at 49 n 9, \u201c[w]hile the benefits of a public trial are frequently intangible, difficult to prove, or a matter of chance, the Framers plainly thought them nonetheless real.\u201d Accordingly, in the context of the right to public voir dire, MCR 8.116(D) establishes very limited circumstances under which a court may close the courtroom. See, also, <em>Waller, </em>467 US at 48 (explaining that in order to close a courtroom, four requirements must be satisfied: (1) the party seeking closure must advance an overriding interest that is likely to be prejudiced by an open courtroom, (2) the closure must be no broader than necessary to protect that interest, (3) the trial court must consider reasonable alternatives to closing the proceeding, and (4) the trial court must make findings adequate to support the closure). In my view, these strict limitations on courtroom closure indicate the importance placed on the right to a public trial, including voir dire, under <em>Presley, </em>558 US at 212-213.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b794-5\"> The majority also criticizes my preference for a general rule of automatic reversal for structural errors with a citation to <em>New York v Hill, </em>528 US 110, 114; 120 S Ct 659; 145 L Ed 2d 560 (2000). As the majority states, <em>Hill </em>acknowledged that \u201ccertain fundamental rights\u201d require a personal and informed waiver by the defendant, i.e., automatic reversal. <em>Hill, </em>528 US at 114. The majority opinion could be read as arguing that <em>Hill </em>stands for the proposition that the denial of the right to counsel and the right to plead not guilty are the <em>only </em>errors that require automatic reversal. See <em>ante </em>655-656 n 42. However, as the majority later acknowledges in footnote 44 of its opinion, <em>Hill </em>clearly offers the denial of those two rights as <em>examples </em>of errors requiring automatic reversal. <em>Hill, </em>528 US at 114 (\u201cFor certain fundamental rights, the defendant must personally make an informed waiver. <em>See, e.g., Johnson v Zerbst, </em>304 US 458, 464-465; 58 S Ct 1019; 82 L Ed 1461 (1938) (right to counsel); <em>Brookhart v Janis, </em>384 US 1; 7-8, 86 S Ct 1245; 16 L Ed 2d 314 (1966) (right to plead not guilty).\u201d) (emphasis added). Thus, the majority opinion should not be interpreted as limiting the scope of constitutional rights that require automatic reversal to only the rights discussed in <em>Hill.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b794-6\"> See <em>United States v Marcus, </em>560 US 258,_; 130 S Ct 2159, 2168; 176 L Ed 2d 1012 (2010) (Stevens, J., dissenting) (explaining that plain-error analysis \u201crequires lower courts to conduct four separate inquiries, each of which requires a distinct form of judgment and several of which have generated significant appellate-court dissensus; <em>the test may also contain an exception for \u2018structural errors,\u2019 </em>a category we have never defined clearly\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b796-7\"> Indeed, other courts have also struggled with this paradox. See <em>United States v Floresca, </em>38 F3d 706, 712 (CA 4, 1994) (concluding that the error at issue was structural but nevertheless reluctantly applying plain-error review and stating that \u201c[w]e apply <em>[United States </em>v] <em>Olano </em>[507 US 725; 113 S Ct 1770; 123 L Ed 2d 508 (1993)] although it is by no means clear that we should,\u201d and that \u201c[i]t is an open question as to whether the absence of an objection requires further analysis when the alleged error goes to the heart of the entire judicial process\u201d). Thus, while the majority may be correct to rely on implications in the available caselaw regarding the interplay between plain-error and harmless-error analysis, it is nevertheless clear that courts understandably continue to struggle with this unsettled issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-8\">Another possible way to view the difficult issue presented by unpreserved structural errors may be to conclude that structural errors require automatic reversal because even if the plain-error analysis is applied, all four prongs will <em>always </em>be satisfied when the error is structural. See, e.g., <em>United States v Redo, </em>371 F3d 1093, 1103 n 7 (CA 9, 2004) (\u201c[I]t is difficult to imagine a case where structural error will not satisfy [the] fourth requirement [of the plain-error analysis].\u201d); <em>United States v Rodriguez, </em>406 F3d 1261, 1266 (CA 11, 2005) (Carnes, J., concurring) (\u201cBecause structural error, where it exists, renders a criminal punishment fundamentally unfair, it would be difficult to justify a conclusion that an error that is structural does not \u2018seriously affect[] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted). But other courts that have applied plain-error analysis to structural errors have concluded that not all structural errors satisfy the fourth prong of the analysis. See, e.g., <em>United States v Vazquez, </em>271 F3d 93, 100 (CA 3, 2001); <em>United States v David, </em>83 F3d 638, 647-648 (CA 4, 1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b797-5\"> Although I disagree with this Court\u2019s adoption of the federal plain-error doctrine for the reasons provided in <em>People v Grant, </em>445 Mich 535, 554-557, 520 NW2d 123 (1994) (Levin, J., concurring); and <em>Carines, </em>460 Mich at 775-783 (Marilyn Kelly, J., dissenting), I nonetheless recognize that <em>Carines </em>is the law in Michigan, as I have done in previous cases. See <em>People v Shafier, </em>483 Mich 205, 219-224; 768 NW2d 305 (2009).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b797-6\"> I agree with the majority that under Michigan\u2019s current law, plain-error review is applicable to denial of the right to public voir dire if no objection to the denial was lodged. However, because structural errors are generally subject to automatic reversal, <em>Neder, </em>527 US at 8; <em>Washington, </em>548 US at 218-219, and the caselaw illustrates the uncertainty regarding when structural errors should be subjected to plain-error analysis, the extension of plain-error analysis in this case is limited to only unpreserved structural error that results from the improper denial of the right to public voir dire. Accordingly, the majority\u2019s opinion should not be broadly interpreted to extend plain-error review to any other structural errors but instead should be limited to the circumstances of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b799-7\"> Moreover, the exclusion of a defendant\u2019s family has been given special consideration in this area of the law. \u00e1ee, e.g., <em>Watters v State, </em>328 Md 38, 48; 612 A2d 1288 (1992) (stating that excluding a defendant\u2019s family deprives the family of the ability \u201cto contribute their knowledge or insight to the jury selection\u201d and prevents the venire from seeing the interested individuals); <em>United States v Garland, </em>364 F2d 487, 489 (CA 2, 1966) (stating that \u201cit [was] improper to exclude any portion of the public, <em>particularly a member of a defendant\u2019s family\u201d </em>without sufficient <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>justification) (emphasis added). Relying on the venire alone to serve the purpose of public participation in the jury-selection process ignores the unique role of a defendant\u2019s family in the courtroom.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
