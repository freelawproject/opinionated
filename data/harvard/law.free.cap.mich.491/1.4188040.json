Defendant was accused of burning a vacant house and charged on that basis with burning other real property in violation of MCL 750.73. There is no dispute that the trial court wrongly added an extraneous element to the statute under which defendant was charged. Specifically, the trial court ruled that the prosecution was required to present proof that the burned house was not a dwelling, which is not a required element of MCL 750.73. As a result of the trial court\u2019s erroneous addition of this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>extraneous element to the charged offense, it granted defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict and entered an order of acquittal, dismissing the case. We hold that when a trial court grants a defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict on the basis of an error of law that did not resolve any factual element of the charged offense, the trial court\u2019s ruling does not constitute an acquittal for the purposes of double jeopardy and retrial is therefore not barred. Accordingly, because the trial court\u2019s actions did not constitute an acquittal for the purposes of double jeopardy, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">Defendant, Lamar Evans, was charged with burning other real property, MCL 750.73,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for starting a fire in a vacant house. At trial, two Detroit police officers testified that while on routine patrol on September 22, 2008, they observed a house on fire at 9608 Meyers Street and investigated. After hearing an explosion at the burning house, the officers observed defendant running away from the side of the house with a gasoline can. Officer Jermaine Owens got out of the patrol car and told defendant to stop. When defendant continued to run, Officer Owens chased defendant on foot. Defendant dropped the gasoline can during the chase, and Officer Owens caught defendant after he tripped and fell. Officer Cyril Davis, who had initially joined the chase <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>on foot, returned to the patrol car and drove it to where Officer Owens had detained defendant. The officers testified that defendant told them he had made a mistake and burned down the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-4\">An arson investigator from the Detroit Fire Department, Lieutenant Christopher Smith, determined that the burn patterns in the house indicated the use of ignitable liquid accelerants. Further testing showed that gasoline had been poured in the kitchen, dining room, and a bedroom. As a result, Smith concluded that the fire was arson. No one was living in the house at the time of the fire, and the house lacked gas, electricity, and water service. The homeowner testified that he was in the process of purchasing the house, which needed repairs, and that he and his family had begun moving their belongings into the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">Upon the close of the prosecution\u2019s proofs, defense counsel moved for a directed verdict under MCR 6.419(A),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> arguing that the prosecution had failed to prove that the burned building was not a dwelling house. Defense counsel argued that the jury instructions indicated that a necessary element of the burning of other real property is that the building was <em>not </em>a dwelling, while the prosecution\u2019s evidence reflected only that it <em>was </em>a dwelling. The prosecutor argued that nothing in MCL 750.73 required proof that the building <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>was not a dwelling. The prosecutor also argued that it was unnecessary to read the instructions for the element that the building was not a dwelling and that the jury instructions are only a guide. The trial court then made the following ruling:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-5\"><em>The Court: </em>The Court does not have an option of not reading all of the required elements in a jury instruction, and there are no optional elements in [CJI2d] 31.3. All of them are required. And the instructions are not a guide. They Eire what is required by law.<footnotemark>[3]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-6\">Looking at the commentary, it refers to a distinction between [CJI2d] 31.2 and 31.3. [CJI2d] 31.2 is the instruction that is required for burning [a] dwelling house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-7\">The commentary, speaking of CJI 2nd 31.1 [sic, 31.3], Burning Other Resd Property, the commentary: \u201cThis offense is similar to the one described in CJI 2nd 31.2, except that an essentisd element is that the structure burned is not\u201d \u2014 -which is in italicized writing print \u2014 \u201ca dwelling house.\u201d And then it cites People v Antonelli, A-n-t-o-n-e-l-l-i, 64 Mich App 620, 238 NW 2nd 363 [1975], and notes that it was reversed on other grounds, and gives the citation as 66 Mich App 138, 238 NW 2nd 551 (1975).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b122-8\">And the commentary goes on to say: \u201cAs the Court explained on rehearing, common law arson required that the building be a dwelling. In creating the less serious crime of burning buildings other than dwellings, the legis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>lature simply eliminated the element of habitation. Other real property is all real property not included in MCL 750.72.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-5\">And the People in this case have relied on MCL 750.73, which specifically says it cannot be a dwelling.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-6\"><em>[Prosecutor]: </em>Judge, could I have a moment to go upstairs and pull the statute and make sure that the statute addressed that. Because my understanding of the law is that it doesn\u2019t matter whether it\u2019s a dwelling or not, it just has to be a structure. And that\u2019s the reason for the\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-7\"><em>The Court: </em>Other than a house, because the legislature has imposed a higher-penalty for one burning a house.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-8\">[MCL] 750.73 reads: \u201cBurning of Other Real Property - Any person who willfully or maliciously burns any building or other real property, or the contents thereof, other than those specified in the next preceding section of this chapter, the property of himself or another, shall be guilty of a felony ...[.]\u201d I won\u2019t give the term of punishment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-9\">And it says: \u201cOther than those specified in the next preceding.\u201d Isn\u2019t preceding before? The next preceding section of this chapter would be [MCL] 750.72. [MCL] 750.72 is entitled \u201cBurning Dwelling House,\u201d and reads: \u201cAny person who willfully or maliciously burns any dwelling house, either occupied or unoccupied, or the contents thereof, whether owned by him or another, or any building within the curtilage of such dwelling house, or the contents thereof, shall be guilty of a felony.\u201d I will not read the term of punishment, but it is twice that which is specified in [MCL] 750.73.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-10\">So reading the language of [MCL] 750.73, which refers back to [MCL] 750.72, a dwelling house, either occupied or unoccupied, is excluded by law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-11\"><em>[Prosecutor]: </em>Judge, may I have a moment to go upstairs and consult with my supervisors?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-12\"><em>The Court: </em>You can consult with them when you tell them I\u2019ve granted the motion.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-13\"><em>[Defense Counsel]: </em>Thank you, Judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number><em>The Court: </em>As a matter of law.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-4\">The testimony was this was a dwelling house, paid for for [sic] forty-some-odd thousand dollars. That the folks had moved some stuff into it, even though it doesn\u2019t matter.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-5\">Motion granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">The prosecution appealed, and in an authored opinion, the Court of Appeals reversed the trial court\u2019s order granting defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict and remanded for further proceedings.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The panel stated that it was undisputed that the trial court had erred by concluding that the prosecution was required to prove that the burned building was not a dwelling to convict defendant of burning other real property.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The panel took note of this Court\u2019s statement in <em>People v Nix, </em>453 Mich 619; 556 NW2d 866 (1996), that retrial is barred when the trial court grants a directed verdict of acquittal even when the trial court is \u201c \u2018wrong with respect to whether a particular factor is an element of the charged offense.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Nonetheless, the panel characterized that statement as dicta because \u201cthe majority in <em>Nix . . . </em>acknowledged] that it was unclear whether the situation that concerned the dissent, that dismissal of the case was premised on the prosecution\u2019s failure to establish a nonelement of an offense, had even occurred.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Aq\">The panel then considered the dissenting opinion in <em>Nix, </em>finding it persuasive to support its holding that \u201can actual acquittal occurs, for double jeopardy purposes, \u2018only when the trial court\u2019s action, whatever its form, is a resolution in the defendant\u2019s favor, correct or not, of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>factual element necessary for a criminal conviction.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Applying this holding, the panel concluded that double-jeopardy principles did not bar retrial because the trial court had not resolved a factual element necessary to establish a conviction.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Rather, the trial court had based its directed verdict solely on the prosecution\u2019s failure to present any evidence establishing that the burned building was not a dwelling, which was not an element of the charged offense.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b125-4\">Defendant applied for leave to appeal in this Court, and we granted leave to address \u201cwhether [defendant\u2019s] retrial is barred under the double jeopardy clauses of the state and federal constitutions where the trial court\u2019s grant of defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict was based on an error of law and did not determine any actual element of the charged offense.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Defendant\u2019s claim that the double-jeopardy provisions of the United States and Michigan Constitutions bar his retrial is reviewed de novo.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b125-7\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b125-8\">The United States and Michigan Constitutions protect a person from being twice placed in jeopardy for the same offense<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> in order \u201cto prevent the state from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>making repeated attempts at convicting an individual for an alleged crime.\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u201c[T]he double jeopardy prohibition \u2018is not against being twice punished, but against being twice put in jeopardy; and the accused, whether convicted or acquitted, is equally put in jeopardy at the first trial.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In addition, this prohibition provides related protections against a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal, second prosecution for the same offense after conviction, and multiple punishments for the same offense.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The protection against a second prosecution for the same offense after an acquittal is at issue here.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In considering whether retrying defendant would violate this protection, we must examine whether the trial court\u2019s ruling constituted an acquittal for the purposes of double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">The United States Supreme Court set forth the stan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>dard for what constitutes an acquittal for the purposes of double jeopardy in <em>United States v Martin Linen Supply Co </em>430 US 564, 571; 97 S Ct 1349; 51 L Ed 2d 642 (1977). The Court considered the effect of a verdict of acquittal entered pursuant to Rule 29(c) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure once the jury had been discharged after being unable to reach a verdict.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> It held that \u201cwhat constitutes an \u2018acquittal\u2019 is not to be controlled by the form of the judge\u2019s action.\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Rather, an acquittal for the purposes of double jeopardy is defined as a \u201cruling of the judge, whatever its label, [that] actually represents a resolution, correct or not, of some or all of the factual elements of the offense charged.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Applying this definition, the Court concluded that the trial court\u2019s ruling constituted an acquittal for the purposes of double jeopardy because the trial court had evaluated all of the prosecution\u2019s evidence and determined that it was insufficient to sustain a conviction.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">Further, an acquittal, defined in <em>Martin Linen </em>as a resolution of the elements of the charged offense, \u201cremains a bar to retrial even if it is \u2018based upon an egregiously erroneous foundation.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> Consistently with the idea that an acquittal can occur in some <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>circumstances when the trial court errs, the United States Supreme Court has determined \u201cthat an acquittal is final even if it is based on an erroneous evidentiary ruling that precluded the prosecution from introducing evidence that would have been sufficient to convict the defendant.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">As noted in <em>People v Szalma, </em>the United States Supreme Court has not directly considered the related question at issue here regarding whether a trial court\u2019s acquittal on a criminal charge based on insufficient evidence bars retrial if the trial court erroneously added an extraneous element to the charge.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> In reaching the conclusion that the United States Supreme Court has not directly addressed this issue, we believe that <em>Szalma </em>persuasively distinguished the relevant decisions from that Court: <em>Arizona v Rumsey, </em>467 US 203; 104 S Ct 2305; 81 L Ed 2d 164 (1984), <em>Smalis v Pennsylvania, </em>476 US 140; 106 S Ct 1745; 90 L Ed 2d 116 (1986), and <em>Smith v Massachusetts, </em>543 US 462; 125 S Ct 1129; 160 L Ed 2d 914 (2005).<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">In <em>Rumsey, </em>the trial court considered whether there was evidence of the statutory aggravating factors that permit a jury to decide whether the death penalty is warranted. The aggravating factor at issue was whether a murder occurred \u201c \u2018as consideration for the receipt, or in expectation of the receipt, of anything of pecuniary value.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> As <em>Szalma </em>explained, the trial court had \u201cerroneously ruled that this aggravating circumstance only involved murders for hire, rather than <em>any </em>murder occurring during the course of a robbery, as the Arizona <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>Supreme Court had interpreted the statute.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The United States Supreme Court concluded \u201cthat the trial court\u2019s decision operated as a verdict on whether defendant was eligible for the death penalty, and that therefore, defendant could not subsequently be placed in jeopardy of death for the same offense, notwithstanding the trial court\u2019s \u2018misconstruction of the statute defining the pecuniary gain aggravating circumstance.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\"><em>Szalma </em>also addressed <em>Smalis, </em>in which the United States Supreme Court considered \u201cwhether a trial court\u2019s granting of a \u2018demurrer\u2019 within the commonwealth of Pennsylvania\u2019s rules of criminal procedure involved an acquittal for double jeopardy purposes.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> The Pennsylvania Supreme Court had held that it was not, reasoning that in deciding whether to grant a demurrer, the trial court was not required to determine a defendant\u2019s guilt, but only \u201cwhether the evidence, if credited by the jury, [was] legally sufficient to warrant the conclusion that the defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> The United States Supreme Court reversed, holding that such a ruling constituted an acquittal for double-jeopardy purposes despite \u201can alleged error that the trial court committed in interpreting the \u2018recklessness\u2019 element of Pennsylvania\u2019s third-degree murder statute.\u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">In <em>Smith, </em>the trial court granted an acquittal on a firearm charge on the basis of its determination that there was no evidence for the element included in the statute governing unlawful possession of a firearm that the barrel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>length of the gun possessed was less than 16 inches.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> After trial continued on the remaining charges, the trial court reversed its ruling when the prosecutor identified precedent under which the victim\u2019s testimony about the kind of gun sufficed to establish that the barrel was shorter than 16 inches.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Despite the trial court\u2019s initial error regarding what evidence could prove the barrel-length element, the United States Supreme Court held that this initial ruling \u201cmeets the definition of acquittal that our double-jeopardy cases have consistently used: It \u2018actually represents a resolution, correct or not, of some or all of the factual elements of the offense charged.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">Reviewing <em>Rumsey, Smalis, </em>and <em>Smith, </em>we agree with the reasoning in <em>Szalma </em>that each of these cases involves evidentiary errors regarding the proof needed to establish a factual element of the respective crimes at issue.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Specifically, in <em>Rumsey, </em>the trial court\u2019s error concerned \u201cnot <em>whether </em>a particular aggravating circumstance [i.e., element] existed to allow a jury to impose a death penalty for first-degree murder, but <em>how the prosecutor must prove the occurrence of that circumstance in a particular </em>case.\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Similarly, in <em>Smalis, </em>the trial court\u2019s alleged error concerned <em>how </em>to prove the recklessness element, not <em>whether </em>the recklessness element existed.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Additionally, in <em>Smith, </em>the trial court\u2019s error regarded \u201cnot <em>whether </em>a particular element to the crime\u201d of unlawful possession of a firearm \u201cexisted, but rather <em>what evidence could prove that </em>element.\u201d<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>Following <em>Martin Linen, </em>these decisions establish that when a trial court makes an error regarding the sufficiency of the evidence to satisfy a factual element or elements of the charged offense, that resolution nonetheless constitutes an acquittal for the purposes of double jeopardy. As we discuss, the principles behind the prohibition against double jeopardy and the definition of acquittal set forth in <em>Martin Linen </em>support the proposition that a constitutionally meaningful difference exists between this case, in which the trial court identified an extraneous element and dismissed the case solely on that basis, and <em>Rumsey, Smalis, </em>and <em>Smith, </em>in which the trial courts made evidentiary errors regarding how to prove the governing law. Accordingly, these decisions do not implicate the case at hand because the trial court\u2019s error here resulted in a dismissal without a resolution regarding the sufficiency of the factual elements of the charged offense.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">Although the United States Supreme Court has not directly considered the question presented here, this Court has dealt with this issue before in <em>Nix </em>and <em>Szalma.</em><footnotemark><em>40</em></footnotemark><em> Nix </em>considered, for the purposes of double jeopardy, the effect of the trial court\u2019s ruling that the defendant \u201ccould not be convicted of either [first-degree premeditated murder or first-degree felony-murder] as a matter of law\u201d because the defendant \u201c \u2018owed no legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>duty to the victim . . . \u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> In responding to the dissent, <em>Nix </em>stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-6\">The dissent appears to read the <em>Martin Linen </em>standard as if the phrase \u201ccorrect or not\u201d refers to the factual truth of the prosecution\u2019s evidence, a determination completely outside the trial court\u2019s purview in a jury trial when considering a defendant\u2019s motion for directed verdict. When ruling on a motion for directed verdict, a trial court must, as this trial court did, view the prosecution\u2019s evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution. Accordingly, the trial court cannot make an erroneous factual resolution. The phrase \u201ccorrect or not\u201d refers to all aspects of the trial court\u2019s ultimate legal decision, including even cases where the trial court is factually wrong with respect to whether a particular factor is an element of the charged offense. As discussed below, however, it is not clear that this situation even exists in the case at bar.<footnotemark>[42]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b132-7\">These statements do not control the outcome here because they are nonbinding obiter dicta.<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> The quotation from <em>Nix </em>explicitly stated that it was \u201cnot clear that this situation\u201d \u2014 i.e., one in which \u201cthe trial court [was] factually wrong with respect to whether a particular factor is an element of the charged offense\u201d\u2014 had even occurred.\u201d<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Rather, <em>Nix </em>reflected the conclusion that the trial court had not erred on its view of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>what made up the essential elements.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> Consequently, the quoted observations regarding the definition of acquittal were unnecessary to determine the outcome in <em>Nix </em>and do not compel a result in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-5\">Further, <em>Szalma </em>does not compel treating the pertinent statements in <em>Nix </em>as controlling. <em>Szalma </em>discussed <em>Nix </em>when considering whether a trial court\u2019s erroneous legal analysis regarding the sufficiency of the evidence to support a conviction of first-degree criminal sexual conduct constituted an acquittal for the purposes of double jeopardy.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> Specifically, the trial court in <em>Szalma </em>granted the defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict after erroneously ruling that the fact-finder had to conclude that the defendant committed the assault for a sexual purpose.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">We pointed out in <em>Szalma </em>that <em>Nix </em>barred a retrial of the defendant because, under <em>Nix, </em>\u201can acquittal retains its finality for double jeopardy purposes even when \u2018the trial court is factually wrong with respect to whether a particular factor is an element of the charged offense.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> We refused to address the prosecution\u2019s argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>ment regarding whether <em>Nix </em>was correctly decided because the prosecutor at trial had conceded the underlying erroneous statement of the elements.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> As a result, we reversed the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment and reinstated the trial court\u2019s directed verdict of acquittal.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\"><em>Szalma </em>does not control the instant case because, here, the prosecutor did not concede the underlying legal error at trial. Rather, the prosecutor argued that the charged offense did not include the element that the building was not a dwelling. Accordingly, the prosecution\u2019s argument is properly before us. In addition, because we refused in <em>Szalma </em>to permit the prosecutor to harbor error at trial and then use that error as an appellate parachute, we could not properly reach the application of <em>Nix. </em>In fully considering <em>Nix </em>now, we will not ignore the <em>Nix </em>majority\u2019s conclusion that it was not clear that the situation bringing about its double-jeopardy discussion had even occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-6\">In making its ruling in the instant case, the trial court acted under MCR 6.419(A),<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> granting defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict because the prosecution had failed to provide evidence that the burned house was not a dwelling. The trial court undisputedly misapprehended CJI2d 31.3<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> in its legally erroneous <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>analysis that added an extraneous element to the charged offense.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> The trial court\u2019s confusion apparently stemmed from its reliance on a jury instruction read when the crime of burning other real property is charged as a lesser included offense of the crime of burning a dwelling.<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> The panel in <em>People v Antonelli </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number><em>0On </em>Rehearing) rightly stated, however, that \u201c[t]he necessary elements to prove either offense are the same, except to prove the greater it must be shown that the building is a dwelling; to prove the lesser it is not necessary to prove that the building is not a dwelling.\u201d<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> Thus, the trial court wrongly determined that showing that the burned building was not a dwelling is an element of burning other real property.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">We agree with the Court of Appeals that defendant\u2019s retrial is not barred because the trial court\u2019s ruling dismissing the case did not constitute an acquittal for the purposes of double jeopardy. \u201c[T]he trial court\u2019s characterization of its ruling is not dispositive, and what constitutes an \u2018acquittal\u2019 is not controlled by the form of the action.\u201d<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> Consequently, the trial court\u2019s actions pursuant to MCE 6.419(A) and its entry of an order of acquittal do not control. Although these actions take the form of an acquittal, we are concerned with the substance of the trial court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">Again, an acquittal for double-jeopardy purposes is a \u201cruling of the judge, whatever its label, [that] actually represents a resolution, correct or not, of some or all of <em>the factual elements </em>of the offense charged.\u201d<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> The trial court\u2019s legal error resulted in its adding an element to the charged offense and requiring the prosecution to provide proof of that extraneous element. As the Court of Appeals concluded, the trial court did not resolve or even address any factual element necessary to establish <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>a conviction for burning other real property. Rather, the substance of the trial court\u2019s ruling was entirely focused on the extraneous element. Consequently, the trial court\u2019s decision was based on an error of law unrelated to defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence on the elements of the charged offense, and thus the trial court\u2019s dismissal of the charge did not constitute an acquittal.<footnotemark>58</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\"><em>Nix </em>misconstrued the definition of acquittal in <em>Martin Linen, </em>stating that \u201con a motion for directed verdict, a trial court must, as this trial court did, view the prosecution\u2019s evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution. Accordingly, the trial court cannot make an erroneous factual resolution.\u201d<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> As the prosecution argues, however, a trial court certainly can make an erroneous factual resolution in ruling on a motion for a directed verdict. The trial court can do so, for instance, when it forgets about evidence or does not realize that certain evidence can satisfy a factual element. This is what took place in <em>Smith v Massachusetts, </em>discussed earlier, when the trial court failed to realize that testimony that the defendant appeared to have a .32 or .38 caliber revolver was sufficient to establish that the factual element that the barrel of the gun was shorter than 16 inches.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> This incorrect resolution of a factual element in <em>Smith </em>constituted an acquittal for the purposes of double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">From this faulty presumption that a trial court cannot make an erroneous factual resolution, <em>Nix </em>wrongly observed that the phrase \u201ccorrect or not\u201d from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number><em>Martin Linen\u2019s </em>definition of acquittal \u201crefers to all aspects of the trial court\u2019s ultimate legal decision, including even cases where the trial court is factually wrong with respect to whether a particular factor is an element of the charged offense.\u201d<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> A court cannot, however, be factually wrong regarding what makes up the elements of the crime because an erroneous determination of what constitutes the elements of an offense is a legal error, not a factual one.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">Instead, the definition of acquittal in <em>Martin Linen </em>and the phrase \u201ccorrect or not\u201d means that it is of no consequence for the purposes of double jeopardy whether the trial court\u2019s resolution of the <em>factual elements </em>is correct. Nonetheless, this resolution must be based on at least some of the factual elements of the charged crime. By adding an extraneous element \u2014 that the prosecution needed to prove that the burned building was not a dwelling \u2014 the trial court\u2019s legal error did not involve a resolution of any of the factual elements of the charged offense, and thus its ruling does not fall within the definition of acquittal for the purposes of double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">We further conclude that the distinction we have drawn from the relevant United States Supreme Court decisions is reasonable and constitutionally grounded. Rather than uniformly determine that any instance in which a trial court enters an order of acquittal definitively bars retrial, the United States Supreme Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>has opted to consistently apply the definition of acquittal from <em>Martin Linen</em><footnotemark><em>63</em></footnotemark><em> </em>By doing so the Court has determined that the labels the trial court used are not controlling and that a resolution must be on the factual elements to constitute an acquittal. But the line, once crossed, triggers double-jeopardy protections regardless of the correctness of the trial court\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>64</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">We believe that the application of the definition of acquittal reflects a balancing of the public\u2019s interest in having one full and fair opportunity to prosecute a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>criminal case<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> and the interest in protecting a criminal defendant from being subjected \u201cto embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity, as well as enhancing the possibility that even though innocent he may be found guilty.\u201d<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> When considering the application of this definition and the weighing of these interests, it is reasonable to treat differently cases in which the resolution was based on the prosecution\u2019s failure to prove something that the law, properly understood, did not require it to prove. Doing so depends on whether the trial court actually considered the factual elements of the charged offense. A resolution of the factual elements, even if erroneous, crosses the established bright fine. But a court\u2019s adding an extraneous element and resolving the case solely on the basis of that added element prevents any evaluation of the charged crime on the merits and thus completely thwarts society\u2019s interest in allowing the prosecution one full and fair opportunity to present its case.<footnotemark>67</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b140-5\">Therefore, barring retrial is inappropriate in a case such as this. Because of the trial court\u2019s legal error, no <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>factual elements of the charged offense were considered, and as a result the people have not been afforded the opportunity to have their case reviewed for the sufficiency of the evidence on the factual elements even once. Permitting retrial to allow such an opportunity hardly depicts \u201can all-powerful state relentlessly pursuing a defendant who had either been found not guilty or who had at least insisted on having the issue of guilt submitted to the first trier of fact.\u201d<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> Rather, because the trial court\u2019s actions fell outside the definition of acquittal, permitting defendant\u2019s retrial does not frustrate the prohibition against double jeopardy.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">We hold that when a trial court grants a defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict on the basis of an error of law that did not resolve any factual element of the charged offense, the trial court\u2019s ruling does not constitute an acquittal for the purposes of double jeopardy and retrial is therefore not barred. Accordingly, because the trial court\u2019s actions here did not constitute an acquittal for the purposes of double jeopardy, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<judges id=\"b141-6\">Young, C.J., and Markman and Mary Beth Kelly, JJ., concurred with ZAHRA, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b120-7\"> MCL 750.73 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-8\">Any person who wilfully or maliciously burns any building or other real property, or the contents thereof, other than those specified in the next preceding section of this chapter, the property of himself or another, shall be guilty of a felony, punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for not more than 10 years.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b121-6\"> MCR 6.419(A) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b121-7\">After the prosecutor has rested the prosecution\u2019s case-in-chief and before the defendant presents proofs, the court on its own initiative may, or on the defendant\u2019s motion must, direct a verdict of acquittal on any charged offense as to which the evidence is insufficient to support conviction.

As we will discuss, the trial court ignored a use note in the instructions indicating that it was not appropriate to require proof that the building was not a dwelling unless instructing on the crime of burning other property as a lesser included offense of burning a building. Notwithstanding its failure to properly apply the use note, when there is the potential for inconsistency between a proposed instruction and the applicable law, the trial court had not only the right, but the obligation to reject or modify the instruction to bring it into conformity with the law.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b124-7\"> <em>People v Evans, </em>288 Mich App 410, 411; 794 NW2d 848 (2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b124-8\"> <em>Id. </em>at 416-417.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b124-9\"> <em>Evans, </em>288 Mich App at 418, quoting <em>Nix, </em>453 Mich at 628.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b124-10\"> <em>Evans, </em>288 Mich App at 419.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b125-9\"> <em>Id. </em>at 421-422, quoting <em>Nix, </em>453 Mich at 634-635 (Boyle, J., dissenting).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b125-10\"> <em>Evans, </em>288 Mich App at 423.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b125-11\"> <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b125-12\"> <em>People v Evans, </em>488 Mich 924 (2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b125-13\"> <em>People v Szalma, </em>487 Mich 708, 715; 790 NW2d 662 (2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b125-14\"> US Const, Am V (protecting a criminal defendant from \u201cbe[ing] subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb\u201d); <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 15 (\u201cNo person shall be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy.\u201d).

Furthermore, these statements are not inconsistent with our view of the case at hand because they are necessarily made within the framework of the definition of acquittal established in <em>Martin Linen </em>and the United States Supreme Court has not cast doubt on the viability of that definition. Additionally, it is clear that this case does not involve an erroneous evidentiary ruling or an erroneous interpretation of governing legal principles. The trial court, rather than rightly or wrongly interpreting the governing legal principles, opted to invent a governing principle, terminating the trial on a ground unrelated to defendant\u2019s factual guilt or innocence. The statement from <em>Smith </em>is similarly inapplicable because it was made after the Court had already concluded that an acquittal had occurred.

DOUBLE-JEOPARDY JURISPRUDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">It is axiomatic that under both the state and federal constitutions, a defendant may not be twice put in jeopardy for the same offense. US Const, Am V; Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 15. The underlying focus of the Double Jeopardy Clause is on a defendant\u2019s exposure to the personal strain, embarrassment, and expense of a criminal trial more than once for the same offense. See <em>United States v Scott, </em>437 US 82, 87; 98 S Ct 2187; 57 L Ed 2d 65 (1978), citing <em>Green v United States, </em>355 US <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>184, 187-188; 78 S Ct 221; 2 L Ed 2d 199 (1957); <em>Smalis v Pennsylvania, </em>476 US 140, 143 n 4; 106 S Ct 1745; 90 L Ed 2d 116 (1986). Accordingly, the guarantee against double jeopardy \u201c \u2018protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v DiFrancesco, </em>449 US 117, 129; 101 S Ct 426; 66 L Ed 2d 328 (1980) (citation omitted). Notably, the United States Supreme Court has explained that \u201c \u2018the most fundamental rule in the history of double jeopardy jurisprudence\u2019 \u201d is that an acquittal \u201c \u2018may not be reviewed,\u2019 \u201d on error or otherwise, \u201c \u2018without putting the defendant twice in jeopardy....\u2019\u201d <em>Sanabria v United States, </em>437 US 54, 64; 98 S Ct 2170; 57 L Ed 2d 43 (1978), quoting <em>United States v Martin Linen Supply Co, </em>430 US 564, 571; 97 S Ct 1349; 51 L Ed 2d 642 (1977) (citation and quotation marks omitted). Consistent with this notion, an acquittal is \u201cabsolute,\u201d <em>People v Anderson, </em>409 Mich 474, 483; 295 NW2d 482 (1980), regardless of whether the acquittal is \u201cbased on a jury verdict of not guilty or on a ruling by the [trial] court that the evidence is insufficient to convict. . ..\u201d <em>Scott, </em>437 US at 91.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The threshold question in these types of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>cases, then, is whether a trial court\u2019s ruling on a defendant\u2019s motion for a directed verdict was, in fact, an acquittal. <em>Smith, </em>543 US at 467.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">To determine whether an acquittal actually occurred for purposes of a double-jeopardy analysis, a reviewing court must \u201cdetermine whether the ruling of the judge, whatever its label, actually represents a resolution, <em>correct or not, </em>of some or all of the factual elements of the offense charged.\u201d <em>Martin Linen, </em>430 US at 571 (emphasis added). As the United States Supreme Court has explained, \u201cwhat matters is that. . . the [trial] judge \u2018evaluated the .. . evidence and determined that it was legally insufficient to sustain a conviction.\u2019 \u201d <em>Smith, </em>543 US at 469, quoting <em>Martin Linen, </em>430 US at 572. Accordingly, an order entering a finding that the evidence was insufficient to sustain a conviction \u201cmeets the definition of acquittal that [the] double-jeopardy cases have consistently used. ...\u201d <em>Smith, </em>543 US at 468; see, also, <em>Anderson, </em>409 Mich at 486; <em>Nix, </em>453 Mich at 625-627; 630-631.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">Notably, the United States Supreme Court has stated that the \u201cfundamental nature\u201d of the rule barring review of a verdict of acquittal is \u201cmanifested by its <em>explicit extension\u201d </em>to situations in which an acquittal was based on an incorrect foundation. <em>Sanabria, </em>437 US at 64 (emphasis added). On the basis of this extension, when a defendant is acquitted because of a determination that the evidence was insufficient to support a conviction, \u201cthere is no exception permitting retrial,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 75, \u201ceven if the legal rulings underlying the acquittal were erroneous,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 64, and \u201cno matter how \u2018egregiously erroneous\u2019 . .. the legal rulings lead<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>ing to that judgment might be,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 75, quoting <em>Fong Foo v United States, </em>369 US 141, 143; 82 S Ct 671; 7 L Ed 2d 629 (1962); see, also, <em>Arizona v Rumsey, </em>467 US 203, 211; 104 S Ct 2305; 81 L Ed 2d 164 (1984) (explaining that United States Supreme Court precedent establishes that an \u201cacquittal on the merits bars retrial even if based on legal error\u201d). Thus, \u201c[t]he status of the trial court\u2019s judgment as an acquittal is not affected\u201d by a trial court\u2019s legal error in interpreting governing legal principles: \u201c \u2018[T]he fact that the acquittal may result from erroneous evidentiary rulings <em>or </em>erroneous interpretations of governing legal principles .. . affects the accuracy of that determination but it does not alter its essential character.\u2019 \u201d <em>Smalis, </em>476 US at 144 n 7 (emphasis added; citation and quotation marks omitted), quoting <em>Scott, </em>437 US at 98, and citing <em>Sanabria, </em>437 US 54, and <em>Rumsey, </em>467 US 203.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">In summary, the United States Supreme Court has repeatedly stated that a trial court\u2019s \u201cruling that as a matter of law the State\u2019s evidence is insufficient to establish [the defendant\u2019s] factual guilt\u201d is a \u201c \u2018resolution, correct or not, of some or all of the factual elements of the offense charged\u2019 \u201d and, therefore, constitutes an acquittal for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause. <em>Smalis, </em>476 US at 144 &amp; n 6. Further, that an acquittal was founded on an erroneous legal ruling is irrelevant: the trial court\u2019s judgment of acquittal based on a finding of insufficient evidence, however erroneous, bars retrial. See <em>id. </em>at 145 n 7; <em>Rumsey, </em>467 US at 211. Although I welcome the majority\u2019s decision to embrace policy considerations for the purpose of this appeal, as the United States Supreme Court has explained, \u201c[w]hat may seem superficially to be a disparity in the rules governing a defendant\u2019s liability to be tried again is explainable by reference to the underlying purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause.\u201d <em>Scott, </em>437 US <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>at 91. Specifically, the rule barring retrial after an acquittal is \u201cjustified on the ground that, <em>however mistaken the acquittal may have been, </em>there would be an unacceptably high risk that the Government, with it superior resources, would wear down a defendant, thereby \u2018enhancing the possibility that even though innocent he may be found guilty.\u2019 \u201d <em>DiFrancesco, </em>449 US at 130 (emphasis added), quoting <em>Green, </em>355 US at 188.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">II. <em>NIX </em>IS HARMONIOUS WITH ESTABLISHED PRECEDENT</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">As the foregoing summary illustrates, the principles articulated in <em>Nix </em>are both founded on and harmonious with longstanding United States Supreme Court case-law. See <em>Nix, </em>453 Mich at 624-632; see, also, <em>People v Szalma, </em>487 Mich 708, 727-729; 790 NW2d 662 (2010) (CAVANAGH, J., concurring). Thus, <em>Nix </em>was not, as the majority asserts, based on faulty presumptions or misconstructions of United States Supreme Court precedent. Indeed, contrary to the majority\u2019s position, it bears repeating that the United States Supreme Court \u201chas never held that a trial court\u2019s preverdict acquittal on the merits may be reversed because of a legal error.\u201d <em>Szalma, </em>487 Mich at 728 n 1 (CAVANAGH, J., concurring). Instead, as I have noted, the Court has repeatedly stated the opposite, without crafting the distinction that the majority creates today. In fact, the United States Supreme Court recently reaffirmed the principle that the Double Jeopardy Clause does not provide an exception for legal errors, even if the preverdict acquittal was \u201cpatently wrong in law.\u201d <em>Smith, </em>543 US at 473.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">Accordingly, as explained in <em>Nix, </em>it is irrelevant for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause that an acquittal was founded on an erroneous interpretation of a governing legal principle. <em>Nix, </em>453 Mich at 626-628, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>630-631; see, also, <em>Smalis, </em>476 US at 144 n 7. This is so regardless of whether the erroneous interpretation of the governing legal principle is based on an error in interpreting a statutory requirement or, as in this case, an error in determining the actual elements necessary to commit an offense. <em>Szalma, </em>487 Mich at 728 n 2 (CAVANAGH, J., concurring), citing <em>Rumsey, </em>467 US at 211.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">Further, it elevates form over substance to make such a distinction, as the majority does today. In my view, <em>Rumsey </em>illustrates this point. In that case, a trial court misconstrued a statute defining an aggravating circumstance used for determining whether the death penalty was appropriate. Specifically, the trial court erroneously agreed with the defendant that the statute required the prosecution to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the murder was a \u201ccontract-type\u201d killing, rather than a murder committed during the course of a theft. <em>Rumsey, </em>467 US at 205-207. Because the trial judge found that this aggravating circumstance was not present, the defendant\u2019s life was spared. <em>Id. </em>at 206. Despite the trial court\u2019s error in interpreting the statute, the United States Supreme Court affirmed the Arizona Supreme Court\u2019s ruling that the defendant \u201chad effectively been \u2018acquitted\u2019 of death at his initial sentencing,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 208, holding that, although the trial court had relied on a misconstruction of the statute defining the aggravating circumstance, that error of law was of no avail to the prosecution for purposes of the Double Jeopardy Clause. <em>Id. </em>at 211.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although <em>Rumsey </em>addressed the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>proper interpretation of the statute\u2019s requirements, as even the majority here concedes, the trial court in <em>Rumsey </em>required the prosecution to prove something that it was not otherwise required to prove: that the murder was a contract-type killing.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">In my view, creating a distinction between improperly adding an element to an offense and misconstruing an actual element of a statute to require the prosecution to prove something extraneous \u2014 both situations in which the trial court, because of a legal error, technically determined that the government could not prove a fact that was not necessary to support a conviction\u2014 elevates form over substance. In addition, the majority\u2019s distinction minimizes the United States Supreme Court\u2019s general directive that the Double Jeopardy Clause does not provide an exception for legal errors, even if the acquittal is \u201cpatently wrong in law,\u201d <em>Smith, </em>543 US at 473, and \u201cno matter how \u2018egregiously erroneous\u2019 . . . the legal rulings leading to that judgment might be,\u201d <em>Sanabria, </em>437 US at 75 (citations omitted).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b149-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>Therefore, I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that an error in interpreting a statutory requirement should be treated differently from an error in interpreting the elements necessary for an offense: both errors constitute an erroneous interpretation of a governing legal principle, and both errors may involve a situation in which the trial court\u2019s decision was \u201cbased on the prosecution\u2019s failure to prove something that the law, properly understood, did not require it to prove.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 24; see, also, <em>ante </em>at 24 n 64.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>III. <em>NIX </em>IS CONTROLLING PRECEDENT</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">Except for the composition of this Court, little has changed since the aforementioned principles were articulated in <em>Nix </em>well over a decade ago. Yet today the majority effectively overrules <em>Nix </em>without persuasively explaining why <em>Nix </em>and the United States Supreme Court decisions on which <em>Nix </em>was based should no longer control.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It is therefore clear that the current majority\u2019s rationale is simply based on its unstated, yet apparent, preference for the approach advanced by the <em>Nix </em>dissent and <em>United States v Maker, </em>751 F2d 614 (CA 3, 1984) \u2014 approaches that the <em>Nix </em>majority properly rejected as unpersuasive.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">Further, I disagree with the majority\u2019s implicit conclusion that <em>Nix, </em>when viewed in its totality, does not control the outcome of this case. Rather, notwithstanding the majority\u2019s apparent conclusion to the contrary, <em>Nix </em>addressed the situation presented in this case when it stated that a trial court\u2019s determination that the evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction constitutes an acquittal for double-jeopardy purposes and \u201cprecludes appellate inquiry into [the ruling\u2019s] legal correctness,\u201d <em>Nix, </em>453 Mich at 627, regardless of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>\u201cwhether \u2018the acquittal was based upon an egregiously erroneous foundation\u2019 ... or not,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 631 (citation omitted); see, also, <em>id. </em>at 624-627; <em>Anderson, </em>409 Mich at 483, 486. Thus, in my view, the majority errs by failing to consider <em>Nix </em>in its totality and, in selectively quoting <em>Nix, </em>conveniently turns a blind eye to the doctrine of stare decisis.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">Even assuming arguendo that the majority is correct in classifying selected portions of <em>Nix </em>as dicta, the majority\u2019s sudden decision to classify those portions of <em>Nix </em>as such stands in stark contrast to the majority\u2019s treatment of <em>Nix </em>as \u201ccontrolling\u201d precedent and \u201ccompelling reversal\u201d just two terms ago in a case that considered the exact issue raised in this appeal. Specifically, in <em>Szalma, </em>the majority explained that \u201cthis Court\u2019s decision in <em>Nix </em>provides that a trial court\u2019s erroneously added element of a crime does not negate the finality of its directed verdict,\u201d <em>Szalma, </em>487 Mich at 725, because a trial court\u2019s \u201cacquittal on the merits of the charged offense is final under the holding of <em>Nix;\u201d id. </em>at 722; see, also, <em>id. </em>at 726 (stating that \u201c[t]his Court held in ... <em>Nix </em>that an acquittal retains its finality .. . even when \u2018the trial court is factually wrong with respect to whether a particular factor is an element of the charged offense\u2019 \u201d and the \u201cCourt of Appeals erred by ruling otherwise\u201d), quoting <em>Nix, </em>453 Mich at 628; <em>Szalma, </em>487 Mich at 727 (stating that the \u201ctrial court\u2019s decision .. ., though premised on an erroneous understanding of the legal elements of the charged offense, nonetheless constituted ... a decision on the sufficiency of the evidence under <em>Nix\u201d). </em>In so stating, the <em>Szalma </em>majority accurately explained that <em>\u201cNix </em>holds that such legal error precludes retrial,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 710, that <em>\u201cNix </em>squarely compels a reversal,\u201d <em>id., </em>and that \u201cthis Court\u2019s decision in <em>Nix </em>clearly controls the outcome of this case,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 720 n 21. In light of the <em>Szalma </em>majority\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>treatment of <em>Nix </em>as controlling precedent, I find the majority\u2019s newfound conclusion that <em>Nix </em>is not binding precedent, and its attempts to distinguish Szalma\u2019s treatment of <em>Nix </em>as such, both contradictory and disingenuous.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">The new standard that the majority opinion adopts today effectively overrules <em>Nix </em>without a persuasive explanation of why <em>Nix </em>and the United States Supreme Court precedent on which it was founded should no longer control. In obfuscating these precedents and creating distinctions that simply do not appear to exist, the majority dismisses the fact that whether a trial court erred in its interpretation of the elements of the crime is irrelevant: the essential character of an acquittal is not altered, even if the acquittal results from \u201cerroneous interpretations of governing legal principles . .. .\u201d <em>Smalis, </em>476 US at 144 n 7 (citations and quotation marks omitted). Because the United States Supreme Court has rejected <em>\u201cany contention </em>that the Double Jeopardy Clause must itself. .. leave open a way of correcting legal errors,\u201d <em>Smith, </em>543 US at 473 (emphasis added), I dissent from the majority\u2019s decision to summarily disregard <em>Nix </em>and the controlling precedent on which <em>Nix </em>is based. Accordingly, I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<judges id=\"b152-8\">Marilyn Kelly, J., concurred with Cavanagh, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b143-5\"> The United States Supreme Court has further elaborated that it has \u201clong held that the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment prohibits reexamination of a court-decreed acquittal <em>to the same extent </em>it prohibits reexamination of an acquittal by jury verdict,\u201d regardless of whether the judge\u2019s ruling of acquittal comes in a bench trial or a jury trial. <em>Smith, </em>543 US at 467 (emphasis added). The Court also explained that there is a \u201csingle exception to the principle that acquittal by judge precludes reexamination of guilt no less than acquittal by jury\u201d: the prosecution can appeal to reinstate a jury\u2019s verdict of guilty after a \u201ctrial judge (or an appellate court) sets aside that verdict and enters a judgment of acquittal... .\u201d <em>Id. </em>That exception, however, is not applicable in this case. See, also, <em>DiFrancesco, </em>449 US at 130 (stating that the Court \u201cnecessarily afford[s] absolute finality to a jury\u2019s <em>verdict </em>of acquittal \u2014 no matter how erroneous its decision\u201d) (citation and quotation marks omitted); <em>Sanabria, </em>437 US at 64 n 18 (stating that \u201c[i]t is without constitutional significance that the court entered a judgment of acquittal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>rather than directing the jury to bring in a verdict of acquittal or giving it erroneous instructions that resulted in an acquittal\u201d); cf. <em>People v Ellis, </em>468 Mich 25; 658 NW2d 142 (2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b147-5\"> As I have stated before, the error in <em>Rumsey </em>was clearly related to the proper interpretation of the statute\u2019s requirements, rather than a mere evidentiary error as the majority purports.

See, also, <em>Smalis, </em>476 US at 145 n 8 (explaining that <em>Rumsey </em>involved \u201can erroneous construction of the [governing] law\u201d). Further, it bears repeating that \u201cthe majority\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>discussion of whether the errors in certain cases should be characterized as evidentiary errors is irrelevant because . . . the United States Supreme Court has repeatedly stated\u201d that the Double Jeopardy Clause precludes retrial when there has been an acquittal on the merits \u201cregardless of <em>either </em>evidentiary errors <em>or </em>erroneous interpretations of governing legal principles.\u201d <em>Szalma, </em>487 Mich at 728 n 2 (Cavanagh, J., concurring).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b148-8\"> In light of the United States Supreme Court\u2019s broad assertion that <em>\u201cany contention </em>that the Double Jeopardy Clause must itself. . . leave open a way of correcting legal errors is at odds with the well-established rule that <em>the bar will attach to a preverdict acquittal that is patently wrong in law,\u201d Smith, </em>543 US at 473 (emphasis added), I disagree with the majority\u2019s assertion that the Court\u2019s statement in <em>Smith </em>does not apply in this case. See, also, <em>Sanabria, </em>437 US at 64 (stating that the \u201cfundamental nature\u201d of the rule barring review of a verdict of acquittal is \u201cmanifested by its <em>explicit extension to situations where an acquittal is \u2018based upon an egregiously erroneous foundation\u2019 </em>\u201d) (emphasis added), quoting <em>Fong Foo, </em>369 US at 143. Accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>ingly, the United States Supreme Court has clearly and emphatically stated that the bar to retrial attaches even when the acquittal itself is legally wrong or based on an incorrect foundation, notwithstanding the majority\u2019s assertions to the contrary in this case. See <em>ante </em>at 23 n 64 (stating that <em>Smith </em>does not apply because the Court had already concluded that an acquittal had occurred and asserting that this case does not involve an erroneous interpretation of a governing legal principle because the trial court opted to \u201cinvent a governing principle\u201d); see, also, <em>Smith, </em>543 US at 467-468 (stating that an order entering a finding that the evidence was insufficient to sustain a conviction \u201cmeets the definition of acquittal that [the] double-jeopardy cases have consistently used: It \u2018actually represents a resolution, <em>correct or not, </em>of some or all of the factual elements of the offense charged.\u2019 \u201d), quoting <em>Martin Linen, </em>430 US at 571 (emphasis added); <em>Smalis, </em>476 US at 144 (stating that a \u201cruling that as a matter of law the State\u2019s evidence is insufficient to establish [a defendant\u2019s] factual guilt\u201d is an acquittal under the Double Jeopardy Clause); <em>Anderson, </em>409 Mich at 486 (same).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"A_\"> The <em>Nix </em>Court is not the only court to hold that it makes no difference for double- jeopardy purposes whether the trial court ruled that there was insufficient evidence related to a required element of the offense or whether there was insufficient evidence related to an erroneously added element.

Thus, this Court has had the opportunity to review the aforementioned precedents on at least two other occasions, yet decided not to overrule <em>Nix. </em>I would continue this practice of adhering to <em>Nix </em>because, as noted, <em>Nix </em>is consistent with United States Supreme Court precedent.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b150-7\"> Although it is apparent that the majority\u2019s opinion is influenced by <em>Maker, </em>the majority fails to explain why <em>Maker </em>should now govern despite <em>Nix\u2019s </em>rejection of it more than a decade ago.
