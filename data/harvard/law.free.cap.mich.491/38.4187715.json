We cannot presume that the Legislature intended to abrogate this right. Therefore, we overrule <em>People v Ventura, </em>262 Mich App 370; 686 NW2d 748 (2004), to the extent that it held that the Legislature affirmatively chose to modify the traditional common-law rule that a person may resist an unlawful arrest. Because the Court of Appeals in this case relied on <em>Ventura </em>and extended its holding to the context of illegal entries of the home, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand this matter to the trial court. On remand, we instruct the trial court to grant defendant\u2019s motion to quash the charges on the basis of its ruling that the officers\u2019 conduct was unlawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">This case arises from a physical struggle that occurred between defendant and two Holland police officers when the officers sought to enter defendant\u2019s home without a warrant. As a result of the struggle, defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>dant was charged with resisting and obstructing a police officer and resisting and obstructing a police officer causing injury in violation of MCL 750.81d (1) and (2).</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">On the morning of the incident, Officer Troy DeWys and Officer Matthew Hamberg were searching for Shane Adams. Adams had several outstanding warrants. Defendant\u2019s house was in the immediate vicinity of where Adams\u2019s vehicle was parked, so the officers knocked on defendant\u2019s front and back doors to inquire about Adams. While outside the house, Officer DeWys heard voices and people running inside the house. He identified himself as a police officer and stated that he wanted to ascertain the identities of the people inside the house. Officer Hamberg looked through a basement window and could see empty bottles of alcohol and people trying to hide.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">Approximately 15 minutes after the officers had knocked on the doors, Mandy McCarry opened the front door. Officer DeWys smelled \u201cintoxicants and burnt marijuana.\u201d McCarry admitted that underage persons were consuming alcohol inside the house, but Officer DeWys told her that he was not interested in writing \u201ca bunch of minor in possession tickets.\u201d Officer DeWys told McCarry that he just wanted to identify who was inside the house. Officer DeWys asked McCarry if she knew the owner of the vehicle parked in the street. McCarry asked the officers if they were looking for Adams and stated that he was not inside the house. McCarry told the officers that they could not come inside the house without a warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">Officer DeWys then informed McCarry that the officers were entering the house to \u201csecure it\u201d while they waited for a warrant. At that time, defendant came to the front door and demanded that the officers obtain a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>warrant before entering his house. Defendant then attempted to close the door, but Officer Hamberg put his shoulder against the door to prevent defendant from closing it. A struggle ensued between defendant and the officers. Ultimately, the officers pulled defendant from his doorway, physically subdued him, and arrested him. Officer DeWys suffered a torn hamstring and bruised elbow in the struggle.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">Defendant was charged with assaulting, resisting, or obstructing a police officer, MCL 750.81d(l), and assaulting, resisting, or obstructing a police officer causing injury, MCL 750.81d(2). Defendant was bound over for trial. He moved to quash the charges, arguing that the officers\u2019 entry into his home was unlawful. The trial court concluded that the officers had unlawfully entered defendant\u2019s home, specifically ruling that there were no exigent circumstances that would have provided an exception to the warrant requirement. Nevertheless, the trial court concluded that a \u201clawful\u201d action by an officer is not a requirement of MCL 750.81d and, therefore, denied defendant\u2019s motion to quash the charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">Defendant appealed as of right. The Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s decision in an unpublished opinion per curiam.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals relied on <em>Ventura </em>for the proposition that the lawfulness of police conduct is no longer an element of the offenses of resisting and obstructing because MCL 750.81d abrogated the common-law right to resist an unlawful arrest.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Therefore, the Court of Appeals concluded that the officers\u2019 conduct in forcibly entering defendant\u2019s home did not have to be lawful in order for defendant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>be charged under MCL 750.81d.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This Court granted defendant\u2019s application for leave to appeal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">This case involves the interpretation and application of a statute, which is a question of law that this Court reviews de novo.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b160-6\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">A. THE LANGUAGE OF MCL 750.81d DOES NOT SUPPORT ABROGATION</p>\n<p id=\"b160-8\">The issue before this Court is whether a person present in his or her own home can resist a police officer who unlawfully and forcibly enters the home or whether MCL 750.81d prohibits resisting unlawful actions by a police officer. Specifically, we must decide whether the Legislature intended to abrogate the common-law right to resist an unlawful arrest with its 2002 enactment of MCL 750.81d.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-9\">MCL 750.81d states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-10\">(1) Except as provided in subsections (2), (3), and (4), an individual who assaults, batters, wounds, resists, obstructs, opposes, or endangers a person who the individual knows or has reason to know is performing his or her duties is guilty of a felony punishable by imprisonment for not more than 2 years or a f\u00edne of not more than $2,000.00, or both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b160-11\">(2) An individual who assaults, batters, wounds, resists, obstructs, opposes, or endangers a person who the individual knows or has reason to know is performing his or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>her duties causing a bodily injury requiring medical attention or medical care to that person is guilty of a felony punishable by imprisonment for not more than 4 years or a fine of not more than $5,000.00, or both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-4\">(3) An individual who assaults, batters, wounds, resists, obstructs, opposes, or endangers a person who the individual knows or has reason to know is performing his or her duties causing a serious impairment of a body function of that person is guilty of a felony punishable by imprisonment for not more than 15 years or a fine of not more than $10,000.00, or both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-5\">(4) An individual who assaults, batters, wounds, resists, obstructs, opposes, or endangers a person who the individual knows or has reason to know is performing his or her duties causing the death of that person is guilty of a felony punishable by imprisonment for not more than 20 years or a fine of not more than $20,000.00, or both.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-6\">(7) As used in this section:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-7\">(a) \u201cObstruct\u201d includes the use or threatened use of physical interference or force or a knowing failure to comply with a lawful command.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-8\">When interpreting statutes, this Court must \u201cascertain and give effect to the intent of the Legislature.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The words used in the statute are the most reliable indicator of the Legislature\u2019s intent and should be interpreted on the basis of their ordinary meaning and the context within which they are used in the statute.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In interpreting a statute, this Court avoids constructions that would render any part of the statute surplus-age or nugatory.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>In addition to these basic rules of statutory interpretation, this Court must also adhere to the traditional rules concerning abrogation of the common law. The common law remains in force unless it is modified.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We must presume that the Legislature \u201cknow[s] of the existence of the common law when it acts.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Accordingly, this Court has explained that \u201c[t]he abrogative effect of a statutory scheme is a question of legislative intent\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> and that \u201clegislative amendment of the common law is not lightly presumed.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> While the Legislature has the authority to modify the common law, it must do so by speaking in \u201c \u2018no uncertain terms.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Moreover, this Court has held that \u201cstatutes in derogation of the common law must be strictly construed\u201d and shall \u201cnot be extended by implication to abrogate established rules of common law.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> In this case, we must be mindful of the rules regarding abrogation of the common law when determining whether the Legislature, in enacting MCL 750.81d, intended to abrogate the common-law right to resist unlawful police conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">Defendant was charged with resisting and obstructing a police officer in violation of MCL 750.81d. In Michigan, obstructing a police officer has been recognized as a common-law crime, as well as an offense governed by statute.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In addition, the right to resist <em>unlawful </em>arrests, and other <em>unlawful </em>invasions of pri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>vate rights, is well established in our state\u2019s common law.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In explaining the common-law right to resist an unlawful arrest, this Court has stated that \u201cone may use such reasonable force as is necessary to prevent an illegal attachment and to resist an illegal arrest\u201d and that \u201cthe basis for such preventive or resistive action is the illegality of an officer\u2019s action, to which [a] defendant immediately reacts.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">In <em>Ventura, </em>the Court of Appeals compared the prior version of the resisting-arrest statute, MCL 750.479, to the current version, MCL 750.81d. The prior version stated in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b163-5\">Any person who shall knowingly and willfully... obstruct, resist, oppose, assault, beat or wound. .. any ... person or persons authorized by law to maintain and preserve the peace, in their lawful acts, attempts and efforts to maintain, preserve and keep the peace, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor .... [MCL 750.479, as enacted by 1931 PA 328.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b163-6\">Noting that the prior version, MCL 750.479, included a reference to the lawfulness of an officer\u2019s actions, the Court of Appeals in <em>Ventura </em>then turned to the language of MCL 750.81d.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The Court stated that it could not find any similar reference to lawfulness in MCL 750.81d.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> The Court also noted that other jurisdictions have found the right to resist an unlawful arrest to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>\u201coutmoded in our contemporary society.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> The Court concluded that the Legislature had made an \u201cobvious affirmative choice to modify the traditional common-law rule that a person may resist an unlawful arrest.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> We disagree. We hold that MCL 750.81d did not abrogate the right to resist unlawful police conduct and that <em>Ventura </em>was wrongly decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">A fundamental principle of statutory construction is that common-law meanings apply unless the Legislature has directed otherwise.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> If the Legislature intended to abrogate the common-law right to resist unlawful conduct by an officer, it had to do so by speaking in \u201c \u2018no uncertain terms.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Significantly, nowhere in MCL 750.8Id does the Legislature state that the right to resist unlawful conduct by an officer no longer exists.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b165-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>The prior resisting-arrest statute, MCL 750.479 as enacted by 1931 PA 328, prohibited obstructing or resisting a person \u201cauthorized by law to maintain and preserve the peace, in their lawful acts . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The current resisting-arrest statute, MCL 750.81d, prohibits obstructing or resisting an \u201cindividual\u201d who is \u201cperforming his or her duties.\u201d We cannot conclude that the common-law right to resist an unlawful act by an officer ceased to exist merely because the Legislature did not include the word \u201clawful\u201d in this phrase from MCL 750.81d. In fact, this Court has recently clarified that the Legislature\u2019s failure to expressly provide for a common-law defense in a criminal statute does not prevent a defendant from relying on that defense.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">In <em>People v Dupree, </em>this Court addressed whether a defendant could properly raise the common-law affirmative defense of self-defense when charged under the felon-in-possession statute, MCL 750.224f.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The felon-in-possession statute does not explicitly indicate that self-defense is an available defense to this charge. Nevertheless, this Court clarified that \u201c[t]he Legislature\u2019s failure to provide explicitly for the common law affirmative defense of self-defense does not foreclose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>defendants from relying on it to justify a violation of MCL 750.224f.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> Specifically, this Court explained that \u201c[historically, in cases in which the statutory provision did not squarely resolve the issue before this Court, we have applied the common law, presuming that the Legislature enacted statutes mindful of those aspects of common law that have become \u2018firmly embedded in our jurisprudence . .. \u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> This Court went on to explain that \u201c[m]ore recently, the United States Supreme Court recognized the interrelated nature of criminal statutes and the common law, stating that legislative bodies enact criminal statutes \u2018against a background of Anglo-Saxon common law . .. .\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Finding this rationale instructive, this Court concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-5\">[a]bsent some clear indication that the Legislature abrogated or modified the traditional common law affirmative defense of self-defense for the felon-in-possession charge in MCL 750.224\u00cd or elsewhere in the Michigan Penal Code, we presume that the affirmative defense of self-defense remains available to defendants if supported by sufficient evidence.<footnotemark>[32]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">In the context of resisting or obstructing an officer, there must be some clear indication in MCL 750.81d that the Legislature abrogated the common-law right to resist an officer\u2019s unlawful conduct if this Court is to so hold. This Court has recognized that \u201c \u2018[t]he obstruction of or resistance to a public officer in the <em>performance of his duties </em>is an offense at common law, and by statute in all jurisdictions.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> MCL 750.81d expressly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>defines \u201cobstruct\u201d as a \u201cknowing failure to comply with a <em>lawful </em>command.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> However, the decision of the Court of Appeals in this case conflicts with the statutory language. The Court held that MCL <em>750.81dprohibits </em>a person from resisting an officer\u2019s unlawful conduct, yet the statute <em>allows </em>a person to obstruct an officer\u2019s unlawful command. This conflict casts substantial doubt on the argument that the Legislature intended, let alone \u201cclearly intended,\u201d to abrogate the common-law right to resist an unlawful arrest by not including the phrase \u201cin their lawful acts\u201d in MCL 750.81d.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">Based on the plain language of MCL 750.81d, and without any certain indication otherwise by the Legislature, we cannot simply assume that the Legislature intended to abrogate the common-law right to resist an unlawful arrest with its enactment of MCL 750.81d. Such an interpretation of the statute would be inconsistent with this Court\u2019s rules of statutory construction when abrogation of the common law is at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">In this case, the Court of Appeals held that \u201c[t]he fact that defendant refused entry to the officers unless they obtained a search warrant is indicative of defendant\u2019s knowledge of their status as police officers and that they were engaged in the performance of their official duties.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> There is no question that defendant knew that the men at his door were police officers. However, the officers wanted to enter defendant\u2019s home without a warrant, and one of the officers physically prevented defendant from closing the door to his home. Accordingly, defendant\u2019s refusal to allow the officers into his home is not conclusive of whether defendant had reasonable cause to know that the officers were \u201cengaged in the performance of their official duties.\u201d Consistently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>with the common-law rule, we conclude that the prosecution must establish that the officers\u2019 actions were lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-6\">B. THE LEGISLATIVE HISTORY OF MCL 750.81d DOES NOT SUPPORT ABROGATION</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">The legislative history of MCL 750.81d is also helpful in demonstrating that that the Legislature did not intend to abrogate the right to resist an unlawful act by an officer. However, this history must be reviewed in conjunction with the history of the corresponding statute, MCL 750.479. Before 2002, it was clear that a person had the right to resist unlawful police conduct. The pre-2002 version of MCL 750.479 governed the offense of resisting and obstructing and generally prohibited resisting an officer discharging his or her duties.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> This Court interpreted the former version of MCL 750.479 as including the Michigan common-law principle that \u201cone may use such reasonable force as is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>necessary to prevent an illegal attachment and to resist an illegal arrest. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Thus, the former version of MCL 750.479 included the right to resist unlawful police conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-5\">In 2002, the Legislature passed House Bill 5442, amending the prior version of MCL 750.479.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Simultaneously, the Legislature enacted House Bill 5440 as 2002 PA 266, which added MCL 750.81d. Both bills contained reciprocal language providing that each would not take effect unless both were enacted into law.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> The amended version of MCL 750.479 no longer prohibits a person from resisting \u201cpersons authorized by law to maintain and preserve the peace,\u201d but is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>instead targeted at prohibiting threatening and dangerous conduct toward a list of enumerated persons connected with law enforcement.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> The statute provides a tiered penalty structure for various degrees of danger posed and harm caused to a person protected by the statute,<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> clarifies that a person can be charged with and convicted of an underlying offense, and provides courts with discretion to impose a sentence for violating this statute that must be served consecutively to any sentence for an offense arising out of the same transaction.<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Further, the statute defines the term \u201cobstruct\u201d as including \u201cthe use or threatened use of physical interference or force or a knowing failure to comply with a lawful command.\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b170-4\">Meanwhile, MCL 750.81d focuses on prohibiting dangerous and threatening conduct toward a \u201cperson\u201d protected by the statute.<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> This includes resisting an officer\u2019s actions. The statute expressly enumerates the law enforcement officials and other emergency responders who are protected and requires that an individual have reason to know that his or her conduct is directed toward a person \u201cperforming his or her duties.\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> Like MCL 750.479, MCL 750.81d provides a tiered penalty structure for various degrees of danger posed and harm caused to a person protected by the statute,<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> clarifies that a person can be charged with and convicted of an underlying offense, and provides courts with discretion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>to impose a sentence for violating the statute that must be served consecutively to any sentence for an offense arising out of the same transaction.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> Further, just like MCL 750.479, MCL 750.81d defines the term \u201cobstruct\u201d as including \u201cthe use or threatened use of physical interference or force or a knowing failure to comply with a lawful command.\u201d<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> As evidenced by the language of these two statutes, it is clear that the Legislature changed some, but not <em>all, </em>aspects of the common law governing the offenses of resisting and obstructing a peace officer.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> The Legislature made these changes using language that clearly set forth the changes it intended to make.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-4\">In contrast, the Legislature expressed no intent to do away with the common-law right to resist an unlawful arrest.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> The most that could be said in favor of finding <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>an abrogation of that right is the omission of the phrase \u201cin their lawful acts\u201d from MCL 750.81d. However, similar language regarding lawful acts was included in both MCL 750.81d and the amended version of MCL 750.479. Both statutes now include language that this Court has used in the past to explain that the common-law offense of obstructing or resisting an officer occurs while the protected person is \u201cperforming his or her duties.\u201d The term \u201cduty\u201d generally means \u201csomething that one is expected or required to do by moral or legal obligation\u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> and legally implies \u201can obligation one has by law or by contract.\u201d<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> MCL 750.479 and MCL 750.81d both imply that the charged person \u201cknows or has reason to know\u201d that a protected individual is \u201cperforming his or her duties\u201d when engaging in conduct authorized by law or required by legal obligation.<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> Thus, the Legislature retained the concept that the offense of resisting and obstructing requires that an officer\u2019s actions are lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>This Court has explained that if there is doubt about whether a statute abrogates established common-law rules, the statute shall he \u201c \u2018given the effect which makes the least rather than the most change in the common law.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> Nevertheless, without any certain indication of the Legislature\u2019s intent to abrogate the common-law right to resist an unlawful arrest, the Court of Appeals in <em>Ventura </em>pronounced that it was \u201cadopting] the modern rule that a person may not use force to resist an arrest made by one he knows or has reason to know is performing his duties regardless of whether the arrest is illegal under the circumstances of the occasion.\u201d<footnotemark>55</footnotemark> However, we find nothing in the language or legislative history of this statute to support this conclusion. Therefore, we simply cannot conclude that the Legislature abrogated the common-law right to resist unlawful invasions of private rights in \u201cno uncertain terms.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Accordingly, we overrule <em>Ventura </em>to the extent that it concluded that the common-law right to resist an unlawful arrest was abrogated by MCL 750.81d.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">While the Legislature has the authority to modify the common law, it must do so by speaking in \u201cno uncertain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>terms.\u201d<footnotemark>56</footnotemark> Neither the language of MCL 750.81d nor the legislative history of this statute indicates with certainty that the Legislature intended to abrogate the common-law right to resist unlawful arrests or other unlawful invasions of private rights.

For example, in the context of self-defense, the Legislature changed the common-law duty to retreat by enacting MCL 780.972, which specifically explains that there is no longer a duty to retreat under certain enumerated circumstances. The Legislature also enacted MCL 780.973 and MCL 780.974, which explicitly clarify that certain other aspects of the common law relating to self-defense were not abrogated. In enacting MCL 750.81d, the Legislature could have easily abrogated the right to resist an unlawful act by an officer by simply stating that the provision could be violated regardless of whether an officer\u2019s actions are lawful. The Legislature chose not to include such language.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-10\">Nevertheless, the dissent reasons that because MCL 750.81d does not include a \u201c \u2018lawful acts\u2019 proviso,\u201d the Legislature \u201cclearly\u201d and \u201cin no uncertain terms\u201d abrogated the common law and excluded the lawfulness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>of a police officer\u2019s conduct as an element of resisting an officer. The dissent relies on a footnote in <em>Reed v Breton, </em>475 Mich 531, 539 n 8; 718 NW2d 770 (2006), explaining that the mere absence of language specifically abrogating the common law does not necessarily mean that no abrogation occurred. However, nothing in Heed changes the longstanding rule that the Legislature must speak in no uncertain terms when it intends to abrogate the common law, and <em>Reed </em>does not support the dissent\u2019s position that the mere <em>absence </em>of language is somehow the same as the <em>presence </em>of \u201cno uncertain terms.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"26\">\n<p id=\"b165-6\"> We note that while MCL 750.479 was amended by 2002 PA 270, it has not been repealed and remains an alternative statute under which resisting and obstructing may be charged.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b165-7\"> <em>People v Dupree, </em>486 Mich 693, 705; 788 NW2d 399 (2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b165-8\"> <em>Dupree, </em>486 Mich at 705.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b166-7\"> <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b166-8\"> <em>Id., </em>quoting <em>Garwols v Bankers Trust Co, </em>251 Mich 420, 424; 232 NW 239 (1930).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b166-9\"> <em>Dupree, </em>486 Mich at 705, quoting <em>United States v Bailey, </em>444 US 394, 415 n 11; 100 S Ct 624; 62 L Ed 2d 575 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[32]\">\n<p id=\"b166-10\">32 <em>Dupree, </em>486 Mich at 706.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b166-11\"> <em>Krum, </em>374 Mich at 361 (emphasis added; citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b167-6\"> MCL 750.81d(7)(a) (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b167-7\"> <em>Moreno, </em>unpub op at 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"36\">\n<p id=\"b168-8\"> The former version of MCL 750.479 provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b168-9\">Any person who shall knowingly and wilfully obstruct, resist or oppose any sheriff, coroner, township treasurer, constable or other officer or person duly authorized, in serving, or attempting to serve or execute any process, rule or order made or issued by lawful authority, or who shall resist any officer in the execution of any ordinance, by law, or any rule, order or resolution made, issued, or passed by the common council of any city board of trustees, or common council or village council of any incorporated village, or township board of any township or who shall assault, beat or wound any sheriff, coroner, township treasurer, constable or other officer duly authorized, while serving, or attempting to serve or execute any such process, rule or order, or for having served, or atempted [sic] to serve or execute the same, or who shall so obstruct, resist, oppose, assault, beat or wound any of the above named officers, or any other person or persons authorized by law to maintain and preserve the peace, in their lawful acts, attempts and efforts to maintain, preserve and keep the peace, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, punishable by imprisonment in the state prison not more than 2 years, or by a fine of not more than 1,000 dollars.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"37\">\n<p id=\"b169-6\"> <em>Krum, </em>374 Mich at 361.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b169-7\"> MCL 750.479 now provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-8\">(1) A person shall not knowingly and willfully do any of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-9\">(a) Assault, hatter, wound, obstruct, or endanger a medical examiner, township treasurer, judge, magistrate, probation officer, parole officer, prosecutor, city attorney, court employee, court officer, or other officer or duly authorized person serving or attempting to serve or execute any process, rule, or order made or issued by lawful authority or otherwise acting in the performance of his or her duties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b169-10\">(b) Assault, batter, wound, obstruct, or endanger an officer enforcing an ordinance, law, rule, order, or resolution of the common council of a city hoard of trustees, the common council or village council of an incorporated village, or a township board of a township.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"39\">\n<p id=\"b169-11\"> The arguments offered for passing these bills were to protect persons in all professions connected to law enforcement instead of only peace officers and to establish a tiered penalty structure based on the seriousness of the injury actually inflicted.

The only issue here is whether the Legislature abrogated the right to resist police conduct that is later determined to have been unlawful. Before 2002, the Legislature in MCL 750.479 made it unlawful to resist a police officer, but only if that officer was performing what was later determined to constitute a \u201clawful act.\u201d However, in 2002, the Legislature amended MCL 750.479 and also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>enacted a new statute addressing this subject, MCL 750.81d, neither of which contains the \u201clawful act\u201d requirement. By doing this, the Legislature clearly excluded consideration of the lawfulness of the police officer\u2019s conduct as a relevant element in forcibly resisting an officer as long as the police officer was \u201cperforming his or her duties,\u201d and it did so \u201cin no uncertain terms.\u201d Therefore, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals, which, in reliance on <em>Ventura, </em>held that defendant was properly charged with resisting and obstructing a police officer under MCL 750.81d after he physically struggled with officers who had entered his home.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">I.

Both statutes make it unlawful not only to assault or resist these individuals, but also to endanger them while they are performing their duties. Both statutes also have multitiered penalty structures based on the level of injury suffered.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-11\">The question before us concerns whether the rule announced in <em>Clements </em>and reaffirmed in <em>Krum, </em>374 Mich at 361, that \u201cone may use such reasonable force as is necessary to prevent an illegal attachment and to resist an illegal arrest\u201d remains the rule of law in Michigan in light of the 2002 amendment of MCL 750.479 and the enactment of MCL 750.81d. More specifically, the issue concerns whether a person who forcibly resists a police officer who is unlawfully entering that person\u2019s home may be found guilty of violating MCL 750.81d. I believe that the answer to the latter question must be in the affirmative.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-12\">As mentioned earlier, in 2002 the Legislature enacted significant changes to this state\u2019s resisting-and-obstructing laws. Perhaps the most significant change <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>pertained to the elimination of the phrase \u201cin their lawful acts\u201d from MCL 750.479. This language was also notably left out of the newly enacted MCL 750.81d. This is significant because while the former version of MCL 750.479 clearly made it unlawful to resist police officers only if those officers were performing \u201clawful acts,\u201d the absence of this same language in MCL 750.8Id equally clearly makes it unlawful to resist police officers regardless of whether those officers were performing \u201clawful acts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b180-7\">At the outset, it must be observed that the majority states that the issue here is \u201cwhether the Legislature intended to abrogate the common-law right to resist an unlawful arrest with its 2002 enactment of MCL 750.81d,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 44, when it cites no case of any Michigan court in support of the underlying assumption that there was such a common-law right in Michigan. Instead, each case the majority cites supports only the proposition that the pre-2002 versions of MCL 750.479 made it illegal to resist a police officer only if the officer\u2019s actions were \u201clawful.\u201d See <em>Krum, </em>374 Mich at 361 (interpreting 1948 CL 750.479), and <em>Clements, </em>68 Mich at 658 (interpreting 1882 How Stat 9257). That is, in Michigan, pursuant to <em>Krum </em>and <em>Clements, </em>there was a <em>statutory </em>right to resist police officers in their unlawful acts. <em>Ventura, </em>262 Mich App at 374 (stating that \u201cunder MCL 750.479, the right to resist an unlawful arrest was, in essence, a defense to the charge of resisting arrest, because the legality of the arrest was an element of the charged offense\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Therefore, con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>trary to the majority\u2019s contention, \u201cthe rules regarding abrogation of the common law,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 46, are not even clearly relevant here.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">However, even assuming that as a legacy of the English common law there was a common-law right to resist unlawful police conduct in Michigan, and therefore that the rules regarding legislative abrogation must be invoked, the Legislature clearly abrogated this common-law right in 2002. \u201cThe common law and the statute laws now in force, not repugnant to this constitution, shall remain in force until they expire by'their own limitations, or are changed, amended or repealed.\u201d Const 1963, art 3, \u00a7 7. \u201cWhether a statutory scheme preempts, changes, or amends the common law is a question of legislative intent.\u201d <em>Wold Architects &amp; Engineers v Strat, </em>474 Mich 223, 233; 713 NW2d 750 (2006). However, \u201cthe Legislature \u2018should speak in no uncertain terms\u2019 when it exercises its authority to modify the common law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dawe </em>v <em>Dr Reuven Bar-Levav &amp; Assoc, PC, </em>485 Mich 20, 28; 780 NW2d 272 (2010), quoting <em>Hoerstman Gen Contracting, Inc v Hahn, </em>474 Mich 66, 74; 711 NW2d 340 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">Assuming that there was a common-law right in Michigan to forcibly resist a police officer\u2019s unlawful acts, I believe the Legislature \u201cin no uncertain terms\u201d abrogated this right when it amended MCL 750.479 and enacted MCL 750.81d. As discussed, before 2002, MCL 750.479 made it unlawful to resist a police officer only if that officer was performing a \u201clawful act.\u201d However, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>2002, the Legislature removed the \u201clawful acts\u201d proviso in MCL 750.479 and enacted MCL 750.81d, which similarly does not contain the \u201clawful acts\u201d proviso. By doing so, the Legislature \u201cin no uncertain terms\u201d excluded the lawfulness of the police officer\u2019s conduct as an element of resisting an officer. That is, the Legislature clearly abrogated the right to resist unlawful police conduct. Therefore, in Michigan, as of 2002, it is unlawful to forcibly resist a police officer, regardless of the lawfulness of the police officer\u2019s actions. As the Court of Appeals explained in <em>Ventura, </em>262 Mich App at 375-377:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-4\">Examining the language of the [sic] MCL 750.81d, unlike in [the former version of] MCL 750.479, we find no reference to the lawfulness of the arrest or detaining act. The language of MCL 750.81d is abundantly clear and states only that an individual who resists a person the individual knows or has reason to know is performing his duties is guilty of a felony. MCL 750.81d. Because the language of the statute is clear and unambiguous, further construction is neither necessary nor permitted, and we decline to \u201c \u2018expand what the Legislature clearly intended to cover\u2019 \u201d and \u201cread in\u201d a lawfulness requirement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b182-5\">When the Legislature enacts statutes, it has knowledge of existing laws on the same subject, and it is not within our province to disturb our Legislature\u2019s obvious affirmative choice to modify the traditional common-law rule that a person may resist an unlawful arrest. [Citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-6\">The majority argues that the common-law right to resist unlawful police conduct was not abrogated because \u201cnowhere in MCL 750.81d does the Legislature state that the right to resist unlawful conduct by an officer no longer exists.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 48. However, this Court has already held that the Legislature does not have to expressly state that it is \u201cabrogating a common-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>law right\u201d in order for it to abrogate a common-law right. As this Court explained in <em>Reed v Breton, </em>475 Mich 531, 539 n 8; 718 NW2d 770 (2006):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-4\">In <em>Wold Architects &amp; Engineers v Strat, </em>474 Mich 223, 234; 713 NW2d 750 (2006), we stated that nothing in the act at issue there showed an intent to abrogate the common law. We did not extend that analysis to conclude that the absence of language specifically abrogating the common law demonstrated that no abrogation occurred.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">Here, the Legislature abrogated the common-law right to resist unlawful police conduct by <em>removing </em>this right from MCL 750.479 and by enacting the related statute, MCL 750.81d, without including this right. The Legislature\u2019s intent to abrogate the common-law right to resist unlawful police conduct is sufficiently clear without its having to specifically state that this was its intent. A legislative body need not provide a blow-by-blow analysis concerning the effect of its actions on the common law when its actions will admit of only the most obvious interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">Contrary to the majority\u2019s position, the Legislature\u2019s striking of the lawfulness requirement from the \u201cresisting\u201d portions of the pertinent statutes was hardly inadvertent. This is evidenced by the fact that the lawfulness requirement was partially retained in the obstruction portions of the statutes. Both statutes define \u201cobstruct\u201d as \u201cthe use or threatened use of physical interference or force or a knowing failure to comply with a <em>lawful command.\u201d </em>MCL 750.479(8)(a); MCL 750.81d(7)(a) (emphasis added). Accordingly, while an individual who physically interferes with or forcibly resists an officer may be guilty of \u201cresisting\u201d or \u201cobstructing,\u201d regardless of whether the officer\u2019s conduct was lawful, an individual who fails to comply with an officer\u2019s command may be guilty of \u201cobstructing\u201d only if <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>the officer\u2019s command was \u201clawful.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> See <em>Brooks v Rothe, </em>577 F3d 701, 707 (CA 6, 2009) (\u201c[A] straightforward reading of the language of [MCL] 750.81d(7)(a) provides that the law can be violated in two ways: by physically resisting a command, whether lawful or unlawful, <em>or </em>by refusing to comply with a lawful command without using force.\u201d) (emphasis in the original). By expressly providing that failing to comply with an officer\u2019s command can constitute obstruction only if the officer\u2019s command was \u201clawful\u201d and yet expressly removing this same lawfulness requirement from the physical interference and resistance portions of the statutes, the Legislature \u201cin no uncertain terms\u201d exercised its authority to modify the common law. That is, it modified the common-law rule \u2014 that one could be found guilty of resisting or obstructing an officer only if the officer\u2019s conduct was lawful \u2014 to allow one to be found guilty of resisting or obstructing an officer for failing to comply with an officer\u2019s lawful command or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>for physically interfering with or resisting the officer regardless of whether the officer\u2019s conduct was lawful. The distinctions drawn are clear, reasonable, and fully within the judgment of the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">The majority further contends that the Legislature\u2019s removal of the language \u201cin their lawful acts\u201d is irrelevant because \u201cthis Court has recently clarified that the Legislature\u2019s failure to expressly provide for a common-law defense in a criminal statute does not prevent a defendant from relying on that defense.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 49, citing <em>People v Dupree, </em>486 Mich 693; 788 NW2d 399 (2010). As discussed earlier, it appears that the right to resist unlawful police conduct was a statutory right rather than a common-law right in Michigan. However, even assuming that it was a common-law right in Michigan, it was a common-law right that the Legislature codified when it enacted 1869 PA 24, which amended a predecessor of MCL 750.479, and rejected when it amended MCL 750.479 and enacted MCL 750.81d in 2002. This historical context makes this case altogether distinguishable from <em>Dupree </em>in which this Court held that an individual charged with being a felon in possession of a firearm can raise the common-law affirmative defense of self-defense even though the felon-in-possession statute is silent regarding self-defense, because the Legislature had never expressly included self-defense in the statute and then removed it. Unlike in <em>Dupree, </em>in which the Legislature simply remained silent about self-defense in the felon-in-possession statute, the Legislature has not remained silent about the right to resist unlawful police conduct. Instead, from 1869 until 2002, the Legislature clearly provided for such a right, and in 2002, the Legislature equally clearly removed it. By doing so, the Legislature \u201cin no uncertain terms\u201d abrogated the right to resist <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>unlawful police conduct,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> and <em>Dupree </em>is hardly relevant in establishing the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">Next, the majority argues that the removal of \u201cin their lawful acts\u201d is irrelevant because it was replaced with \u201csimilar language,\u201d namely, \u201cperforming his or her duties.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 55-56. The majority fails to recognize the substantial distinction between \u201cin their lawful acts\u201d and \u201cperforming his or her duties.\u201d It is well established that the lawfulness of an individual\u2019s conduct is not necessarily determinative of whether that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>individual is \u201cperforming his or her duties\u201d because an individual can commit an unlawful act while \u201cperforming his or her duties.\u201d See <em>People v Corr, </em>287 Mich App 499, 504; 788 NW2d 860 (2010), lv den 488 Mich 946; 794 NW2d 324 (2010) (\u201cUnder MCL 750.81d(l), it is illegal to assault, batter, resist, or obstruct an officer even if the officer is taking unlawful action, as long as the officer\u2019s actions are done in the performance of the officer\u2019s official duties.\u201d). This has been recognized time and time again in the context of the doctrine of respondeat superior. Pursuant to that doctrine, \u201c[a]n employer is generally liable for the torts its employees commit within the scope of their employment. \u201d <em>Hamed v Wayne Co, </em>490 Mich 1, 10-11; 803 NW2d 237 (2011). Indeed, \u201c \u2018[a] municipal corporation may... be liable for an <em>unlawful </em>and unauthorized act of one of its officers or agents if the act was done in the course of his official <em>duty </em>or employment, and within the general scope of his authority.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ross v Consumers Power Co (On Rehearing), </em>420 Mich 567, 624; 363 NW2d 641 (1983), quoting 57 Am Jur 2d, Municipal, School, and State Tort Liability, \u00a7 88, pp 99-100 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>that a municipality may be liable for an unlawful act of an officer if the act was done in the course of the officer\u2019s official duty or employment necessarily means that an officer can commit an unlawful act while \u201cperforming his or her duties.\u201d Therefore, contrary to the majority\u2019s suggestion, \u201cin their lawful acts\u201d and \u201cperforming his or her duties\u201d are not even remotely synonymous.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">However, this is not to say that an officer who is \u201con the clock\u201d is necessarily performing his duties or acting within the scope of his employment. Instead, an officer is performing his duties or acting within the scope of his employment when he is \u201c \u2018 \u201cengaged in the service of his master, or while about his master\u2019s business.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Harried, </em>490 Mich at 11 (citations omitted). \u201cAlthough an act may be contrary to an employer\u2019s instructions\u201d\u2014 or unlawful \u2014 it is within the employee\u2019s scope of employment \u201cif the employee accomplished the act in furtherance, or the interest, of the employer\u2019s business.\u201d <em>Id. </em>On the other hand, \u201c[independent action, intended solely to further the employee\u2019s individual interests, cannot be fairly characterized as falling within the scope of employment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, contrary to the majority\u2019s assertion, the issue here is not whether the officers lawfully entered defendant\u2019s house, but rather whether the officers were acting to further their employer\u2019s or their own individual inter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>ests. In other words, were they going \u201cabout [their] master\u2019s business\u201d or their own business when they entered defendant\u2019s house? <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>7</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">There is no question that the officers in this case were going about their master\u2019s business when they <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>entered defendant\u2019s house. They knocked on defendant\u2019s door because a vehicle belonging to Shane Adams, who had several outstanding warrants, was parked near defendant\u2019s house and a person leaving defendant\u2019s house told one of the officers that several minors were consuming alcohol inside defendant\u2019s house and that Shane Adams \u201cmight be\u201d inside. The officers saw empty bottles of alcohol and several people running and hiding inside the house. The officers were wearing their police uniforms, and they verbally identified themselves as police officers. Fifteen minutes after the officers knocked on the door, defendant\u2019s girlfriend, Mandy McCarry, opened the door and admitted that minors were drinking alcohol inside. When an officer asked her if she knew who owned the vehicle parked on the street, she asked if the officers were looking for Shane Adams and then denied that he was there. Both officers smelled intoxicants, and one of the officers also smelled burnt or burning marijuana. When an officer told McCarry that they were going to enter the house to secure it while they obtained a search warrant, defendant came to the door and, using obscene and vulgar language, told the officers that they could not enter. When defendant moved to close the door, an officer placed his shoulder to the door to prevent it from being closed. A struggle ensued between defendant and the officers, and defendant was removed from the house and arrested. One of the officers suffered a torn hamstring and injured elbow as the result of the struggle, for which he sought medical treatment. The officers entered the house and patted down the occupants for weapons. After a search warrant was obtained, the officers found marijuana inside the house.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">Although the trial court ruled that the officers\u2019 entry into the house was unlawful because they did not yet have a warrant and there were no exigent circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>stances to justify the warrantless entry into the house,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> this does not mean that the officers were not \u201cperforming their duties\u201d when they entered the house. Indeed, the officers were unquestionably acting in furtherance of their employer\u2019s interests and not in furtherance of their own personal interests. They were simply trying to do their job by locating a person who had multiple outstanding warrants while protecting minors who they had reason to believe might have been drinking alcohol and smoking marijuana. Given these circumstances, it cannot be reasonably disputed that the officers were performing their duties as law enforcement officers and, more importantly, that defendant knew or had reason to know that they were performing their duties.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Therefore, defendant had no right under law to resist or obstruct them.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b192-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>II. CONSTITUTIONALITY</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">The next issue is whether MCL 750.81d, so interpreted, is unconstitutional, i.e., whether there is a constitutional right to resist unlawful police conduct. Defendant argues that there is such a right and specifically argues that it derives from the Fourth Amendment, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-5\">The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized. [US Const, Am IV]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">Defendant cites <em>Payton v New York, </em>445 US 573, 590; 100 S Ct 1371; 63 L Ed 2d 639 (1980), for the proposition that \u201cthe Fourth Amendment has drawn a firm line at the entrance to the house [and] [a]bsent exigent circumstances, that threshold may not reasonably be crossed without a warrant.\u201d Although this is certainly true, it says nothing about whether an individual has a right to physically resist a police officer. In other words, while the Fourth Amendment prohibits the police from entering an individual\u2019s house without a warrant absent exigent circumstances, the Fourth Amendment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>says nothing about entitling an individual to physically resist the police when they do enter that individual\u2019s house. Defendant also cites <em>Wright v Georgia, </em>373 US 284, 291-292; 83 S Ct 1240; 10 L Ed 2d 349 (1963), for the proposition that \u201cone cannot be punished for failing to obey the command of an officer if that command is itself violative of the Constitution.\u201d However, <em>Wright </em>says nothing about whether an individual has a right to go <em>beyond </em>simply failing to obey an officer\u2019s unlawful command and actually physically resist the officer. As noted earlier, the Legislature recognized this distinction and expressly incorporated it into our resisting-and-obstructing statutes. MCL 750.479(8)(a); MCL 750.81d(7)(a). Only the \u201cfailure to comply\u201d form of obstruction in these statutes is premised on the officer\u2019s command being lawful; the \u201cphysical interference\u201d alternative says nothing about the lawfulness of the command. Our resisting-and-obstructing statutes are completely consistent with <em>Wright\u2019s </em>prohibition on punishing a person for failing to obey an officer\u2019s unconstitutional command. <em>Wright, </em>373 US at 291-292.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> If the defendant in the instant case had simply refused to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>allow the officers into his home, he could not have been charged with resisting and obstructing, but because he physically resisted the officers, he can be so charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">In summary, defendant has not cited a single case that supports his proposition that a person has some <em>constitutional </em>right to physically resist a police officer who is engaging in unlawful conduct. Indeed, all the cases of which I am aware support the opposite proposition. See, for example, <em>People v Curtis, </em>70 Cal 2d 347, 354; 74 Cal Rptr 713; 450 P2d 33 (1969) (\u201cThere is no constitutional impediment to the state\u2019s policy of removing controversies over the legality of an arrest from the streets to the courtroom.\u201d); Miller, <em>Retail Rebellion and the Second Amendment, </em>86 Ind L J 939, 952-953 (2011) (\u201c[N]o Supreme Court decision has ever held that the right to defend against an unlawful arrest is a constitutional as opposed to a mere common law right.\u201d). That there is no constitutional right to resist unlawful police conduct is also obviously supported by the fact that the Model Penal Code,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> the Uniform Arrest Act,<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>and <em>\u201ca </em>majority of states\u201d<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> have abolished the right. <em>Barnes v State, </em>946 NE2d 572, 576 (Ind, 2011).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s decision to reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and to overrule <em>Ventura. </em>Before 2002, the Legislature in MCL <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>750.479 made it unlawful to resist a police officer, but only if that officer was performing what was later determined to constitute a \u201clawful act.\u201d However, in 2002, the Legislature amended MCL 750.479 and also enacted a new statute addressing this subject, MCL 750.81d, neither of which contains the \u201clawful act\u201d requirement. By doing this, the Legislature clearly excluded consideration of the lawfulness of the police officer\u2019s conduct as a relevant element in forcibly resisting an officer as long as the police officer was \u201cperforming his or her duties,\u201d and it did so \u201cin no uncertain terms.\u201d Therefore, I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals, which, in reliance on Ventura, held that defendant was properly charged with resisting and obstructing a police officer under MCL 750.81d after he physically struggled with officers who had entered his home.</p>\n<judges id=\"b196-4\">YOUNG, C.J., concurred with MARKMAN, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b175-8\"> The trial court ruled that the officers had unlawfully entered defendant\u2019s home, and the prosecutor did not appeal that ruling. Therefore, this opinion is written under the assumption that the officers\u2019 entry was unlawful.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b180-9\"> I recognize, of course, that there was an English common-law right to resist unlawful arrests. Apparently, this right originated from the belief that an unlawful arrest \u201ccreated adequate provocation for the victim, thus justifying the victim\u2019s resistance and reducing the charge from murder (an unprovoked killing) to manslaughter (a killing upon sufficient provocation).\u201d Hemmens &amp; Levin, \u201cNot <em>a Law at All\u201d: A Call for a </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number><em>Return to the Common Law Right to Resist Unlawful Arrest, </em>29 Sw U L R1,9 (1999), citing <em>Hopkin Huggett\u2019s Case, </em>84 Eng Rep 1082 (KB, 1666). This right was later extended to excuse assaults against police officers. Hemmens &amp; Levin, 29 Sw U L R at 11, citing Rex <em>v Thompson, </em>168 Eng Rep 1193 (KB, 1825). However, the majority cites no authority for the proposition that this aspect of English common law was ever expressly adopted in Michigan.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b184-6\"> The majority holds that \u201cthe decision of the Court of Appeals in this case conflicts with the statutory language\u201d because the Court \u201cheld that MCL 750.81d <em>prohibits </em>a person from resisting an officer\u2019s unlawful conduct, yet the statute <em>allows </em>a person to obstruct an officer\u2019s unlawful command.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 51 (emphasis in the original). The decision of the Court of Appeals does not, in my judgment, conflict in any way with the statutory language; rather, the majority simply fails to recognize the distinction between physically interfering with or resisting an officer and simply failing to comply with an officer\u2019s command. Pursuant to MCL 750.81d, while an individual may be guilty of the former even if the officer\u2019s conduct is unlawful, an individual can be guilty of the latter only if the officer\u2019s command was lawful. For example, if a person responds to an officer\u2019s unlawful command to hand over his car keys by punching the officer, this person may be guilty of obstructing the officer; however, if the person does nothing other than refuse to hand over his keys, he would not be guilty of obstructing the officer. This distinction makes perfect sense. It is perfectly logical to punish people who physically interfere with an officer, even if the officer\u2019s conduct is unlawful, yet not punish those people who do nothing other than fail to comply with an officer\u2019s unlawful command.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b186-5\"> Defendant argues that he should be able to claim \u201cself-defense\u201d because the Self-Defense Act, MCL 780.972(2), provides, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-6\">An individual who has not or is not engaged in the commission of a crime at the time he or she uses force other than deadly force may use force other than deadly force against another individual anywhere he or she has the legal right to be with no duty to retreat if he or she honestly and reasonably believes that the use of that force is necessary to defend himself or herself or another individual from the imminent <em>unlawful </em>use of force by another individual. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">First, defendant may very well have been engaged in the commission of a crime when he used force to resist the officers\u2019 entry into his house. Marijuana was found inside defendant\u2019s house, and defendant\u2019s girlfriend admitted that minors were drinking alcohol inside defendant\u2019s house. Even more significantly, it is well established that \u201cthe more specific provision prevails over the more general. ...\u201d <em>Manuel v Gill, </em>481 Mich 637, 648-649; 753 NW2d 48 (2008). Clearly the resisting-and-obstructing statute more specifically pertains to the subject of resisting and obstructing a police officer than does the Self-Defense Act, and pursuant to the resisting-and-obstructing statute, an individual can only forcibly resist a police officer if he does not know or have reason to know that the officer is performing his duties. MCL 750.81d; see also <em>State v Hobson, </em>218 Wis 2d 350, 365; 577 NW2d 825 (1998), in which a similar argument was rejected. Moreover, there is no evidence that defendant \u201c \u2018reasonably believe[d]... that he [was] in immediate danger of unlawful bodily harm from his adversary....\u2019\u201d <em>Dupree, </em>486 Mich at 707, quoting 2 LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law (2d ed), \u00a7 10.4, p 142. At most, defendant could reasonably have believed that he was in immediate danger of an unlawful entry into his home by a police officer, which does not give rise to a right to forcefully resist.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b187-5\"> See also <em>Anschutz v Liquor Control Comm, </em>343 Mich 630, 637; 73 NW2d 533 (1955) (\u201c[T]he instruction to the employee did not relieve defendant from responsibility for the illegal act on the ground that such employee placed himself outside the scope of his employment when he violated it.\u201d); <em>Barnes v Mitchell, </em>341 Mich 7, 19-20; 67 NW2d 208 (1954) (\u201c \u2018The application of the rule <em>respondeat superior </em>does not depend upon the obedience of the servant to his master\u2019s orders, nor upon the legality of the servant\u2019s conduct; where a servant is acting within the scope of his employment, and in so acting does something negligent or wrongful, the employer is liable, even though the acts done may be the very reverse of that which the servant was actually directed to do.\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted); <em>Randall v Chicago &amp; Grand Trunk R Co, </em>113 Mich 115, 119; 71 NW 450 (1897) (\u201c \u2018[T]he fact that the injury was occasioned by the negligent or unlawful acts of the appellant\u2019s employ\u00e9s would not make the appellant liable, unless it further appeared that the acts complained of occurred within the scope of the servants\u2019 employment.\u2019 \u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b188-5\"> Even the English common-law right to resist unlawful arrests did not apply to all unlawful arrests.

For example, in <em>United States v Heliczer, </em>373 F2d 241, 245 (CA 2, 1967), cert den, 388 US 917; 87 S Ct 2133; 18 L Ed 2d 1359 (1967), the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit rejected the defendant\u2019s \u201cclaim that if the arrest was unlawful, the agents were not engaged in performing their official duties, and [the defendant] had a right to resist.\u201d <em>Heliczer </em>explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-8\">\u201cEngaged in * * * performance of official duties\u201d is simply acting within the scope of what the agent is employed to do.

The majority on the other hand, does not cite a single case in support of its contrary position.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b191-5\"> Again, because the prosecutor did not appeal that ruling, this opinion is premised on the assumption that there were no \u201cexigent circumstances\u201d to justify the warrantless entry into the house, and thus that the entry was unlawful. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that the \u201cexigent circumstances\u201d exception to the warrant requirement does allow the police to enter a home without a warrant to prevent the \u201cimminent destruction of evidence,\u201d <em>In re Forfeiture of $176,598, </em>443 Mich 261, 267-268; 505 NW2d 201 (1993), and when asked why the officers \u201cwanted to \u2018secure\u2019 the residence,\u201d one officer testified, \u201c[W]e wanted to prevent any destruction of evidence and so we were going to secure it so noone [sic] could flush marijuana or further eat it, or do whatever they could to destroy it,\u201d and the other officer testified that their entry \u201cwas based on probable cause that there was evidence that could be destroyed inside the residence.\u201d Accordingly, even assuming that the officers\u2019 entry was unlawful \u2014 and I undertake no effort to resolve that question in this case\u2014 the officers did not believe at the time that it was unlawful, and they certainly believed that they were performing their duties.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b191-6\"> Indeed, defendant himself has never argued that the officers were not performing their duties in the instant case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b191-7\"> The majority refers to a hypothetical situation posed by Justice CAVANAGH at oral argument in which a male officer, while performing a search, sexually assaults a female prisoner.

Otherwise, the majority contends, this female prisoner would not be allowed to resist the officer without risking a resisting-and-obstructing charge. I respectfully disagree. The officer in Justice Cavanagh\u2019s hypothetical situation simply cannot be said to have been performing his duties, not simply because his actions were unlawful, but because they were \u201cindependent action[s] accomplished solely in furtherance of [his] own criminal interests,\u201d i.e., outside the scope of his employment. <em>Homed, </em>490 Mich at 11.
