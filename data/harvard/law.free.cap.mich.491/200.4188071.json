The one-year-back rule is designed to limit the amount of benefits recoverable under the no-fault act to those losses occurring no more than one year before an action is brought. Plaintiff here is seeking to recover no-fault benefits for losses dating back 32 years before she brought her action. In denying defendant\u2019s motion for partial summary disposition, the circuit court relied on <em>Univ of Mich Regents v Titan Ins Co</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>to hold that the minority/insanity tolling provision tolls the one-year-back rule. In <em>Regents, </em>this Court held that a saving provision that tolls a statute of limitations also prevents application of the one-year-back rule. <em>Regents </em>overruled <em>Cameron v Auto Club Ins Ass\u2019n</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>and <em>Liptow v State Farm Mut Auto Ins Co,</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which had held that the saving provisions at issue only tolled a statute of limitations, not statutes limiting damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">We once again hold that the minority/insanity tolling provision, which addresses only when an action may be <em>brought, </em>does not preclude the application of the one-year-back rule, which separately limits the <em>amount </em>of benefits that can be recovered. These distinctions were recognized in Michigan law both in <em>Cameron </em>as well as several decisions of this Court that predate <em>Cameron. </em>Yet this Court\u2019s decision in <em>Regents </em>conflated these distinct concepts in order to effectuate what the <em>Regents </em>majority believed was a broader social good served by expanding the right to recover benefits beyond those allowed by law. We recognize the necessity for, and value of, stability in the law and take no pleasure in overruling a precedent of recent vintage by this Court. But <em>Regents </em>itself simply <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>failed to apply our then recent decision in <em>Cameron, </em>resulting in a decision that patently failed to enforce the requirements of the statutes that it interpreted. Because the holding in <em>Regents </em>contravened the Legislature\u2019s clear and unambiguous language in MCL 500.3145(1) and MCL 600.5851(1), <em>Regents </em>is overruled and we reinstate <em>Cameron. </em>Accordingly, we remand this case to the circuit court for entry of an order granting defendant\u2019s motion for partial summary disposition on the basis of the one-year-back rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-5\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b320-6\">In June 1977, then 17-year-old plaintiff, Doreen Joseph, was involved in an automobile accident in which she suffered traumatic brain injury and quadriplegia. At the time of the accident, plaintiff had automobile insurance coverage through the Detroit Automobile Inter-Insurance Exchange, defendant\u2019s predecessor. Defendant later assumed responsibility for paying plaintiffs personal protection insurance (PIP) benefits. Since the date of plaintiffs injury, defendant has paid more than $4 million in PIP benefits for plaintiffs care.</p>\n<p id=\"b320-7\">On February 27, 2009, plaintiff filed a complaint seeking additional PIP benefits for allegedly unpaid case-management services provided by plaintiffs family members. The period for which plaintiff seeks recovery dates back to the date of plaintiffs accident in 1977. Defendant moved for partial summary disposition pursuant to MCR 2.116(C)(10), arguing that the one-year-back rule in MCL 500.3145(1) barred plaintiffs claim with respect to benefits sought for any period more than one year before the February 27, 2009, commencement date of plaintiffs action. Plaintiff responded that her \u201cinsanity\u201d over the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>past 32 years had operated to toll the one-year-back rule pursuant to the minority/insanity tolling provision of MCL 600.5851(1)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">The circuit court denied defendant\u2019s motion for partial summary disposition, citing <em>Regents </em>for the proposition that the minority/insanity tolling provision tolls the one-year-back rule and, thus, if plaintiff is determined to be \u201cinsane,\u201d her recoveiy will not be limited to the year immediately preceding the filing of her complaint. Defendant filed an interlocutory application for leave to appeal in the Court of Appeals and then filed a bypass application for leave to appeal in this Court, arguing that the minority/insanity tolling provision does not apply to the one-year-back rule and that <em>Regents </em>was wrongly decided. We entered orders staying the circuit court proceedings<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and granting defendant\u2019s bypass application to consider whether <em>Regents </em>was correctly decided.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">This Court reviews de novo a circuit court\u2019s decision whether to grant or deny summary disposition.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Similarly, we review de novo issues of statutory interpretation as questions of law.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Our primary goal when interpreting statutes is to discern the intent of the Legislature.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> To do so, we focus on the best indicator of that intent, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>language of the statute itself.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The words used by the Legislature are given their common and ordinary meaning.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> If the statutory language is unambiguous, we presume that the Legislature intended the meaning that it clearly expressed, and further construction is neither required nor permitted.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">Defendant moved for partial summary disposition pursuant to MCR 2.116(C)(10). Because a motion under MCR 2.116(C)(10) tests the factual sufficiency of the complaint, the circuit court must consider the affidavits, pleadings, depositions, admissions, and other evidence submitted by the parties, MCR 2.116(G)(5), in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> If the proffered evidence fails to establish a genuine issue regarding any material fact, the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">A. THE ONE-YEAR-BACK RULE AND THE MINORITY/INSANITY TOLLING PROVISION</p>\n<p id=\"b322-8\">This case requires that we again interpret the limitations on recovery of PIP benefits set forth in the no-fault act. The relevant statutory provision of the no-fault act, MCL 500.3145(1), provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b322-9\">An action for recovery of personal protection insurance benefits payable under this chapter for accidental bodily <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>injury may not be commenced later than 1 year after the date of the accident causing the injury unless written notice of injury as provided herein has been given to the insurer within 1 year after the accident or unless the insurer has previously made a payment of personal protection insurance benefits for the injury. If the notice has been given or a payment has been made, the action may be commenced at any time within 1 year after the most recent allowable expense, work loss or survivor\u2019s loss has been incurred. <em>However, the claimant may not recover benefits for any portion of the loss incurred more than 1 year before the date on which the action was </em>commenced.<footnotemark>[15]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b323-6\">As early as 1984, this Court explained that this statutory provision contains separate and distinct limitations periods that relate both to the timing in which an action may be brought and the damages that may be recovered.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Specifically, we have noted that MCL 500.3145(1)</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-7\">contains two limitations on the time for filing suit and one limitation on the period for which benefits may be recovered:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-8\">\u201c(1) An action for personal protection insurance [PIP] benefits must be commenced not later than one year after the date of accident, <em>unless </em>the insured gives written notice of injury or the insurer previously paid [PIP] benefits for the injury.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-9\">\u201c(2) <em>If </em>notice has been given or payment has been made, the action may be commenced at any time within one year after the most recent loss was incurred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b323-10\">\u201c(3) Recovery is limited to losses incurred during the one year preceding commencement of the action.\u201d<footnotemark>[17]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>Accordingly, a person filing a claim for PIP benefits must do so within a year of the accident unless the insured gives written notice of injury or previously received PIP benefits from the insurer. If notice was given or payment was made, the action can be commenced within one year of the most recent loss. In any case, though, recovery is limited only to losses that have been incurred during the year before the filing of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-5\">The final limitation provided in MCL 500.3145(1) is the limitation on damages known as the one-year-back rule. In <em>Devillers v Auto Club Ins Ass\u2019n, </em>we discussed the significance of the legislative distinction between statutes of limitations and provisions that limit damages, noting that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-6\">although a no-fault action to recover PIP benefits may be <em>filed </em>more than one year after the accident and more than one year after a particular loss has been incurred (provided that notice of injury has been given to the insurer or the insurer has previously paid PIP benefits for the injury), \u00a7 3145(1) nevertheless limits <em>recovery </em>in that action to those losses incurred within the one year preceding the filing of the action.<footnotemark>[18]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-8\">Our Legislature has also independently established, in the Revised Judicature Act (RJA),<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> a <em>general </em>tolling provision in order to aid those who are minors or legally insane. The minority/insanity tolling provision of MCL 600.5851(1) extends the time for filing suit by tolling an otherwise applicable statute of limitations.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> MCL 600.5851(1) provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>[I]f the person first entitled to make an entry or bring an action under this act is under 18 years of age or insane at the time the claim accrues, the person or those claiming under the person shall have 1 year after the disability is removed through death or otherwise, to make the entry or bring the action although the period of limitations has run.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">Notably, by its unambiguous terms, this provision concerns <em>when </em>a minor or person suffering from insanity may \u201cmake the entry or bring the action,\u201d and the provision is entirely silent with regard to the amount of damages recoverable once an action has been brought.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">B. <em>CAMERON </em>AND ITS PROGENY</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">We first considered the interplay between the one-year-back rule and the minority/insanity tolling provision in <em>Cameron </em><footnotemark><em>22</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In <em>Cameron, </em>the plaintiffs\u2019 minor son sustained a closed head injury when an automobile struck his bicycle in 1996. Six years later, in 2002, the plaintiffs filed suit against their no-fault insurer to recover PIP benefits for attendant-care services rendered from 1996 to 1999. The plaintiffs argued that the minority/insanity tolling provision applied to toll the one-year-back rule, rendering recoverable the losses incurred between 1996 and 1999. We disagreed, holding that the minority/insanity tolling provision does not operate to toll the one-year-back rule. We explained in Cameron:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b325-7\">By its unambiguous terms, MCL 600.5851(1) concerns when a minor or person suffering from insanity may \u201cmake the entry or bring the action.\u201d It does not pertain to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>damages recoverable once an action has been brought. MCL 600.5851(1) then is irrelevant to the damages-limiting one-year-back provision of MCL 500.3145(1).<footnotemark>[23]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">That is,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b326-7\">the minority/insanity tolling provision in MCL 600.5851(1), by its plain terms, only addresses when an action may be brought. Therefore, it does not apply to toll the one-year-back rule in MCL 500.3145(1) because that provision does not concern when an action may be brought but, instead, limits the amount of PIP benefits a person injured in an automobile accident may <em>recover.</em><footnotemark><em>[24]</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">In reaching this conclusion, we overruled the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision in <em>Geiger v Detroit Auto Inter-Ins Exch,</em><footnotemark><em>25</em></footnotemark><em> </em>which held that MCL 600.5851(1) applies to toll the one-year-back rule.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> The <em>Geiger </em>panel reasoned <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>that reading the statute in a contrary fashion would \u201cseverely limit the utility\u201d of the minority/insanity tolling provision \u201cand could deprive a person of benefits to which he would otherwise be rightfully entitled.\u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> This Court held that <em>Geiger\u2019s </em>conclusion was not supported by the statutory texts and contravened the Legislature\u2019s unambiguous directives, compelling its overruling. As <em>Cameron </em>explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-4\">[W]e must assume that the thing the Legislature wants is best understood by reading what it said. Because what was said in MCL 500.3145(1) and MCL 600.5851(1) is clear, no less clear is the policy. Damages are only allowed for one year back from the date the lawsuit is filed. We are enforcing the statutes as written. While some may question the wisdom of the Legislature\u2019s capping damages in this fashion, it is unquestionably a power that the Legislature has under our Constitution.<footnotemark>[28]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">After our decision in Cameron, the Court of Appeals in Liptow<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> applied <em>Cameron\u2019s </em>reasoning to hold that separate tolling provisions for state political subdivisions<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> do not preclude the application of the one-year-back rule. The panel reasoned that the plain statutory <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>text of MCL 600.5821(4) indicates that the Legislature intended to exempt the state from statutes of limitations when bringing an action to recover public funds. As in <em>Cameron, </em>the Court recognized that the one-year-back rule is not a statute of limitations, but a damages-limiting provision. Accordingly, because MCL 600.5821(4) does not address damages limitations, the Court of Appeals determined that it has no effect on the one-year-back rule.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Thus, <em>Liptow </em>held that while a political subdivision may <em>bring an action </em>at any time pursuant to MCL 600.5821(4), it cannot <em>recover benefits </em>for any portion of the loss incurred more than one year before the date on which the action was commenced.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-4\">C. <em>REGENTS</em></p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Four years after <em>Cameron </em>and <em>Liptow, </em>in <em>Regents, </em>this Court again considered whether a saving provision tolling a statute of limitations similarly tolls the one-year-back rule.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> In <em>Regents, </em>the plaintiffs brought an action seeking payment from the defendant insurer for the full cost of medical treatment provided to the defendant\u2019s insured who had been treated at the university\u2019s hospital following an automobile accident. The circuit court held that the one-year-back rule barred the plaintiffs from recovering any portion of the loss incurred more than one year before commencement of the action, and the Court of Appeals affirmed. In a narrowly divided decision, this Court reversed the decisions of the lower courts and overruled the recent decisions in <em>Cameron </em>and <em>Liptow, </em>holding, in part, that the minority/insanity tolling provision does, in fact, toll the one-year-back rule. The <em>Regents </em>Court, essentially adopting the dissenting position from <em>Cameron, </em>held that \u201cthe \u2018action\u2019 and \u2018claim\u2019 preserved by [the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>minority/insanity tolling provision] include the right to collect damages\u201d because \u201cthe right to bring an action would be a hollow one indeed if a plaintiff could not recover damages.\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> According to <em>Regents, </em>the one-year-back rule in MCL 500.3145(1) is inapplicable to a statute that preserves a plaintiffs right to bring an action. That is, because MCL 600.5851(1) preserves the rights of minors and insane persons by granting them one year after their disabilities have been removed to bring their civil actions, MCL 600.5851(1) precludes application of the one-year-back rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">Three justices strongly dissented from the decision to overrule <em>Cameron </em>and erase the long-recognized distinction between statutes of limitations and the damages-limiting provision of the no-fault statute. The dissenting justices explained that because the one-year-back rule \u201cserves only as a limitation on the recovery of benefits\u201d and \u201cdoes not define a period within which a claimant may file a cause of action,\u201d the one-year-back rule \u201clies outside the scope of what is affected by the RJA\u2019s minority/insanity tolling provision.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> By holding to the contrary, the dissenting justices concluded that the majority had failed to enforce as written the unambiguous language of the one-year-back rule, and had attempted instead to \u201cdiscern the purpose of the statute from something other than its actual language.\u201d<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">D. <em>REGENTS </em>WAS WRONGLY DECIDED</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">We believe that the ruling in <em>Regents </em>was erroneous for the simple reason that the statutory texts of MCL 500.3145(1) and MCL 600.5851(1) plainly do not sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>port it. MCL 600.5851(1) gives minors and insane persons one year after the removal of their disabilities \u201cto make the entry or bring the action.\u201d By its very terms, the minority/insanity tolling provision is a timing mechanism specifying <em>when </em>a minor or insane person may bring his or her claim; it places no limitation on, and makes no reference to, <em>the amount of damages </em>that can be recovered after the action has been brought. The one-year-back rule in MCL 500.3145(1), on the other hand, forecloses a claimant from recovering \u201cbenefits for any portion of the loss incurred more than 1 year before the date on which the action was commenced.\u201d By its very terms, then, the one-year-back rule is a damages-limiting provision because it limits a claimant\u2019s recovery to those losses incurred during the year before the filing of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">By concluding that the minority/insanity tolling provision of MCL 600.5851(1) operates to toll the one-year-back rule in MCL 500.3145(1), <em>Regents </em>failed to recognize the critical distinction between having the general right to commence an action and the limitation on the right to recover no-fault benefits for losses occurring more than one year before the filing of the action. Indeed, <em>Regents </em>impermissibly interpreted the phrase \u201cbring the action\u201d in MCL 600.5851(1) as conferring on a claimant the right to \u201cbring the action and recover an unlimited amount of damages,\u201d an interpretation which cannot be extracted from the plain and unambiguous statutory text. The dissenting justices in <em>Regents </em>recognized this distinction, contrasting the one-year-back rule, which provides that the claimant \u201cmay not recover benefits for any portion of the loss incurred more than 1 year before the date on which the action was commenced,\u201d with MCL 600.5821(4), which provides that an action by the state or one of its political <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>subdivisions \u201cmay be brought at any time without limitation.\u201d The dissenting justices in <em>Regents </em>properly observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-4\">[W]hen these two provisions are read together, it is clear that while a political subdivision may <em>bring </em>an action at any time, it cannot <em>recover </em>benefits for any portion of the loss incurred more than 1 year before the date on which the action was commenced. In other words, MCL 600.5821(4), which pertains only to <em>when </em>an action may be commenced, does not preclude the application of the one-year-back rule, which only limits <em>how much </em>can be recovered after the action has been commenced.<footnotemark>[36]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">This interpretation is merely an extension of the same legal rationale applied in <em>Cameron, </em>in which the Court distinguished the plain language of the one-year-back rule from the plain language of the minority/insanity tolling provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">Again, the rules of statutory interpretation mandate that we give effect to the Legislature\u2019s intent, relying on the plain language of the no-fault statute itself. If the statutory language is unambiguous, we must presume that the Legislature intended the meaning it clearly expressed and further construction is neither required nor permitted.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> As is evident from its holding, the interpretation advanced by <em>Regents </em>superseded the Legislature\u2019s explicit intent that recovery of PIP benefits be limited to losses incurred within one year before the date on which an action is filed. The statutory provision containing the one-year-back rule employs plain, clear, and simple language. The minority/insanity tolling provision sets forth an equally simple concept, tolling the time in which an action may be commenced after a person\u2019s disability is removed. This tolling <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>provision, however, is silent regarding the amount of damages a claimant may recover and, accordingly, there is no support for the conclusion that the minority/insanity tolling statute precludes application of the no-fault act\u2019s one-year-back rule. Because <em>Regents </em>reached such a conclusion, it was wrongly decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-5\">Application of the <em>Regents </em>Court\u2019s interpretation of the one-year-back rule to this case illustrates how that decision defeats the very purpose of the rule. Under <em>Regents, </em>plaintiff would be permitted to recover PIP benefits for those losses incurred during the 32 years <em>predating </em>the filing of her action on February 27, 2009, in addition to those losses incurred <em>after </em>that date and continuing for the remainder of her life. Permitting recovery in that manner ignores the plain language of the one-year-back rule, which limits plaintiffs recovery to those losses incurred within one year before February 27, 2009, while still allowing additional recovery for all losses incurred after that date. Although the minority/insanity tolling provision may certainly toll myriad statutory provisions that contain a statute of limitations, it cannot toll the one-year-back rule of MCL 500.3145(1) because the one-year-back rule is not a statute of limitations in that it does not limit the period of time within which a claimant may file an action; rather, the one-year-back rule places a limitation on the amount of damages a claimant is entitled to recover. Furthermore, the one-year-back rule does not serve those purposes typically associated with a statute of limitations because it does not operate to cut off a claim or bar the action or the recovery; it simply limits the compensation available to the claimant.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark> Because the no-fault act\u2019s one-year-back rule and the RJA\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>minority/insanity tolling provision serve manifestly different purposes and function independently of each other, the one-year-back rule is not the subject of tolling under the minority/insanity tolling provision. And this proper interpretation comports both with the plain language of the statute and the legislative purpose of keeping insurance premiums at affordable rates while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>providing victims of motor vehicle accidents assured, adequate, and prompt reparation for certain economic losses.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">E. STARE DECISIS</p>\n<p id=\"b334-5\">Having concluded that <em>Regents </em>was wrongly decided, we must decide whether stare decisis nevertheless compels our adherence to its holding. The test for determining whether stare decisis compels continued adherence to a precedent is set forth in <em>Robinson v </em>Detroit<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> and calls for us to examine, among other factors, \u201c(a) whether the earlier decision was wrongly decided, and (b) whether overruling such decision would work an undue hardship because of reliance interests or expectations that have arisen.\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">First, as discussed previously, <em>Regents </em>was wrongly decided for the simple reason that it ignored the Legislature\u2019s clear and unambiguous directives in MCL 500.3145(1) and MCL 600.5851(1) by failing to enforce these statutory provisions as written. Rather than grounding its analysis on the proper and historically accepted interpretation of the one-year-back rule, the <em>Regents </em>decision appears to have focused on the majority\u2019s concern that a plaintiff allowed to bring a suit under the minority/insanity tolling provision would be precluded by the one-year-back rule from recovering all the damages that might otherwise be permitted outside <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>the no-fault context. However, it is the Legislature\u2019s enactment of the no-fault act\u2019s one-year-back rule that operates to limit the recovery of damages incurred more than one year before an action is commenced, not our interpretation of the minority/insanity tolling provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-5\">With regard to reliance interests, \u201cthe Court must ask whether the previous decision has become so embedded, so accepted, so fundamental, to everyone\u2019s expectations that to change it would produce not just readjustments, but practical real-world dislocations.\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> In discussing this factor, the <em>Regents </em>Court explained: <em>\u201cCameron </em>is of recent vintage, having been decided a mere four years <em>ago. </em>Hence, reliance on its holding has been of limited duration.\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> <em>Regents </em>is of even more recent vintage than was <em>Cameron, </em>having been decided a mere 21 months ago. Certainly, <em>Regents </em>has not \u201cbecome so embedded, so accepted, so fundamental, to everyone\u2019s expectations that to change it would produce . . . practical real-world dislocations\u201d<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> such that reliance interests will be disrupted. While we view the duration of a decision from this Court as important, we believe the foremost indicator that reliance interests weigh in favor of overruling <em>Regents </em>is the plain language of the statutes because it is the unambiguous statutory text that guides the citizenry and their behavior. \u201cThis is the essence of the rule of law: to know in advance what the rules of society are.\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> As we have explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b335-6\">[I]f the words of the statute are clear, the actor should be able to expect, that is, rely, that they will be carried out by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>all in society, including the courts. In fact, should a court confound those legitimate citizen expectations by misreading or misconstruing a statute, it is that court itself that has disrupted the reliance interest. When that happens, a subsequent court, rather than holding to the distorted reading because of the doctrine of stare decisis, should overrule the earlier court\u2019s misconstruction. The reason for this is that the court in distorting the statute was engaged in a form of judicial usurpation that runs counter to the bedrock principle of American constitutionalism, i.e., that the lawmaking power is reposed in the people as reflected in the work of the Legislature, and, absent a constitutional violation, the courts have no legitimacy in overruling or nullifying the people\u2019s representatives.<footnotemark>[46]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b336-4\">Because <em>Regents </em>strayed considerably from the statutory language, it undermined the reliance interest that the people of this state have with regard to that language and with regard to a Court that is committed to upholding such language. As a result, it is this Court\u2019s duty to restore such reliance interests by restoring the law to mean what its language plainly states \u2014 a no-fault \u201cclaimant may not recover benefits for any portion of the loss incurred more than 1 year before the date on which the action was commenced.\u201d<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b336-5\">The one-year-back rule codifies an integral part of the legislative compromise that is the no-fault act, and invalidating that compromise will threaten the continued fiscal soundness of our no-fault system. Given that Michigan is the only state with a no-fault automobile-injury reparations scheme with mandatory, unlimited, lifetime medical benefits, the Legislature adopted a unique approach to defining the temporal limitations for filing suit without allowing open-ended liability or time-barring claims before they accrue. The Legislature <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>addressed this problem by enacting the one-year-back rule, which limits recovery to losses incurred within one year before suit was filed. Thus, the creation of MCL 500.3145(1) was the Legislature\u2019s reasonable and simple approach to resolving the problem of allowing a reasonable amount of time for pursuing a claim while protecting the fiscal integrity of the no-fault system. However, under the <em>Regents </em>interpretation of the one-year-back rule, not only is a claimant permitted to recover those losses incurred after the date on which the action was filed, but recovery also extends to those losses incurred any number of years before the filing date. Permitting a claimant to recover all losses incurred both before and after an action is filed, without any limitation, would nullify this legislative compromise and render the no-fault system unsustainable.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">For these reasons, we overrule <em>Regents </em>and \u201creturn the law, as is our duty, to what we believe the citizens of this state reading these statutes at the time of enactment would have understood [them] to mean.\u201d<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> We are mindful of the importance of stability and continuity in the law and approach with great caution a decision to overrule precedent, but to allow the interpretation of MCL 500.3145(1) and MCL 600.5851(1) set forth in <em>Regents </em>to stand would result in the endorsement of a decision that utterly failed to enforce the requirements of the very statutes it purported to interpret.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">Because the plain and unambiguous language of MCL 500.3145(1) can only be interpreted as limiting the amount of PIP benefits recoverable to those losses incurred within one year before the date the lawsuit is filed, which was the same interpretation advanced by the <em>Cameron </em>majority, we reinstate our previous decision in <em>Cameron.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>F. APPLICATION</p>\n<p id=\"b338-5\">In this case, plaintiff filed her complaint on February 27, 2009, seeking recovery of PIP benefits for losses dating back 32 years. While plaintiff contends that, in light of her alleged insanity, the minority/insanity tolling provision tolls the one-year-back rule, rendering any losses incurred from the date of plaintiffs 1977 accident recoverable, we conclude otherwise. The minority/insanity tolling provision of MCL 600.5851(1), which concerns when an action may be commenced, does not render inoperable the one-year-back rule, which only limits how much can be recovered after the action has been commenced. Consequently, the one-year-back rule does not fall within the purview of what is intended to be tolled by the minority/insanity tolling provision. Accordingly, plaintiffs recovery is limited to losses incurred on or after February 27, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-6\">IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b338-7\">The minority/insanity tolling provision in MCL 600.5851(1) does not apply to toll the one-year-back rule in MCL 500.3145(1) because the one-year-back rule is a damages-limiting provision and does not concern when an action may be brought. These two distinct statutory provisions serve different purposes and by their express language operate separately. Because the decision in <em>Regents </em>ignored the plain statutory directive, it is hereby overruled and <em>Cameron </em>is reinstated.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the circuit court denying defendant\u2019s motion for partial summary dispo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>sition and remand this case to that court for entry of partial summary disposition in defendant\u2019s favor.</p>\n<judges id=\"b339-4\">YOUNG, C.J., and MarkmaN and ZAHRA, JJ., concurred with Mary Beth Kelly, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b319-6\"> <em>Univ of Mich Regents v Titan Ins Co, </em>487 Mich 289; 791 NW2d 897 (2010).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b319-7\"> <em>Cameron v Auto Club Ins Ass\u2019n, </em>476 Mich 55; 718 NW2d 784 (2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b319-8\"> <em>Liptow v State Farm Mut Auto Ins Co, </em>272 Mich App 544; 726 NW2d 442 (2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b321-8\"> The circuit court held that there exists a question of fact regarding whether plaintiff is \u201cinsane\u201d for purposes of MCL 600.5851(1).

Aside from the fact that such \u201csettled law\u201d was a Court of Appeals decision and thus not binding on this Court, the dissent disregards the fundamental principle that not all precedents are deserving of equal respect. <em>Geiger </em>ignored the clear and unambiguous language of MCL 500.3145(1) and MCL 600.5851(1) and was, instead, grounded on its own speculative policy considerations. Because <em>Cameron </em>closely analyzed the actual statutory language and did not allow policy considerations to dictate the result, it is simply deserving of more regard.

Indeed, the dissent\u2019s argument that this construction produces an absurd result was fully considered and rejected in <em>Cameron. </em>As reiterated by the dissenting justices in <em>Regents, </em>\u201c \u2018[i]n choosing to make no-fault insurance compulsory for all motorists, the Legislature has made the registration and operation of a motor vehicle inexorably dependent on whether no-fault insurance is available at fair and equitable rates.\u2019 \u201d <em>Regents, </em>487 Mich at 346-347 (Markman, J., dissenting), quoting <em>Shavers v Attorney General, </em>402 Mich 554, 599; 267 NW2d 72 (1978) (alteration in original). It therefore bears repeating that it is certainly quite <em>possible </em>that in a system that provides mandatory unlimited lifetime benefits, the Legislature intended to impose a limitation on recovery of no-fault benefits in order to make no-fault insurance affordable. This limitation is not only sensible, but necessary for the survival of the no-fault system.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">Insofar as the dissent asserts that it \u201cdefies common sense\u201d to think \u201c[tjhat the Legislature wanted to grant a minor or insane person the right to prove his or her damages in a court of law while lacking any opportunity to be awarded them,\u201d <em>post </em>at 225-226, we note that the statutory language plainly does not confer on a claimant a right to prove and recover an unlimited amount of damages. Instead, the plain language merely confers a right, under certain circumstances, to bring an action despite the period of limitations having expired. The dissent utterly fails to recognize that the one-year-back rule does not operate to preclude a claimant from recovering <em>any </em>damages; rather, a claimant will find himself or herself without any recovery as a result of the one-year-back rule\u2019s operation only if the claimant has not suffered any losses within the one year immediately preceding the filing of the action. Contrary to the dissent, \u201cthat this result will occur \u2018only\u2019 in some circumstances,\u201d <em>post </em>at 226 n 11, hardly constitutes our only response to its claim of \u201cabsurdity.\u201d As previously explained, it is possible that the Legislature chose to impose a limitation on the recovery of no-fault benefits to ensure the financial integrity of the no-fault system.

The characterization is inaccurate.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-9\">The significant point is that <em>Cameron </em>was the first decision in which this Court recognized the distinction between the limitations in MCL 500.3145(1) <em>and </em>applied them differently.
