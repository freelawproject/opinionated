Moeller, </em>105 Or App 434, 806 P2d 130, <em>rev dismissed, </em>312 Or 76, 815 P2d 701 (1991), the Court of Appeals held that the words \u201cscheme or network\u201d in OAR 253-04-002, App 4, are unconstitutionally vague, in violation of Article I, sections 20 and 21, of the Oregon Constitution.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The correctness of that holding is not before us here. The effect of that holding was to affirm the trial court\u2019s order setting aside the indictment in that case.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">The only issue before this court in these 13 cases consolidated for review<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is whether these defendants, each of whom was convicted after trial of one or more \u201cscheme or network\u201d offenses, are entitled to vacation of their convictions and remands to the trial courts with instructions to dismiss their indictments, or only to affirmance of their convictions on the underlying drug offenses and remands to the trial courts for resentencing. We conclude that the latter disposition is correct. Accordingly, the cases are remanded to the trial courts for entry of judgments of conviction on the underlying drug offenses, and for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">Defendants were charged with either manufacture, delivery, or possession of a controlled substance, in violation of ORS 475.992(1) and (4).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In addition to charging the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>underlying offenses, the indictments alleged that the crimes occurred as part of a drug cultivation, manufacture, or delivery \u201cscheme or network\u201d under OAR 253-04-002, App 4 (the rule).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Under the then applicable sentencing guidelines statutes and rules, the effect of that additional allegation was to increase the \u201ccrime-seriousness\u201d rating of each charged offense and thereby to subject a convicted defendant to a greater \u201cpresumptive sentence\u201d than would be the case if only the underlying charged offense were found. ORS 137.120(2); OAR 253-08-001.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Defendants were convicted and sentenced.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> On appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed each defendant\u2019s conviction and remanded each case to the trial court with instructions to dismiss the indictment. We allowed the state\u2019s petitions for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">On review, the state contends that the Court of Appeals erred in reversing defendants\u2019 convictions and in remanding each case to the trial court with instructions to dismiss the indictment. The state concedes that, in the light of <em>State v. Moeller, supra, </em>the \u201cscheme or network\u201d allegations in defendants\u2019 indictments were unconstitutionally vague and, because the sentences imposed on defendants were based on \u201cscheme or network\u201d allegations, their sentences are unlawful. The state argues, however, that there is no basis in the record for concluding that the \u201cscheme or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>network\u201d allegations affected the validity of the convictions entered on the underlying charged drug offenses. Accordingly, the state argues, the appropriate remedy is to affirm the convictions on the underlying charged drug offenses, and to remand the cases for resentencing, with the \u201cscheme or network\u201d allegations disregarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">Defendants reply that, because the indictments contained an unconstitutionally vague allegation that was material to the indictments, the indictments failed to give them notice of the offenses charged. Defendants argue that such a pleading defect goes to the \u201csubstantive heart of the indictments\u201d and vitiates both the indictments in their entirety and also the resulting convictions. Defendants rely on Article VII (Amended), section 5(6), of the Oregon Constitution, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b252-5\">\u201cAn information shall be substantially in the form provided by law for an indictment. The district attorney may file an amended indictment or information whenever, by ruling of the court, an indictment or information is held to be defective in form.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b252-6\">They argue that, under Article VII (Amended), section 5(6), the question presented is whether the indictments are flawed in form or in substance. If the indictments are flawed in substance, defendants argue, the appropriate remedy is to vacate their convictions and dismiss their indictments. For the reasons that follow, we agree with the state\u2019s contention and arguments and reject those of defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">Defendants\u2019 reliance on Article VII (Amended), section 5(6), is misplaced. That section controls whether an amendment to an indictment that has not been approved by the grand jury is constitutional. <em>See State v. Wimber, </em>315 Or 103, 843 P2d 424 (1992) (trial court\u2019s amendment of indictment as to form only was authorized by Oregon Constitution); <em>cf. State v. Russell, </em>231 Or 317, 322-23, 372 P2d 770 (1962) (time to amend substantial facts is while indictment is before grand jury).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">We conclude that the error in defendants\u2019 indictments did not affect the sufficiency of the remaining allegations charging defendants with the underlying drug offenses, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>all of which were properly alleged. ORS 136.460.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, the indictments adequately apprised defendants of the offenses charged against them. The only function of the \u201cscheme or network\u201d allegation in each indictment was to move up the underlying drug offenses on the \u201ccrime-seriousness\u201d scale <em>for sentencing purposes. </em>Although the state is required to plead specially in the indictment any offense-subcategory fact on which it seeks to rely to enhance an offense for sentencing purposes, such an allegation is required <em>in addition to </em>the allegations of the elements of the underlying offense. ORS 135.711.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Thus, the absence of an offense-subcategory allegation as is found here in an indictment or, similarly, a defect in such an allegation, does not affect the sufficiency of the remaining allegations in the indictment. We conclude that the defective \u201cscheme or network\u201d allegations here did not vitiate the indictments in their entirety, nor did the allegation frustrate the constitutional objectives of an indictment. <em>See State v. Wimber, supra, </em>315 Or at 114 (discussing the constitutional purposes of indictments); <em>State v. Smith, </em>182 Or 497, 500-01, 188 P2d 998 (1948) (same).</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\">Defendants also argue that the disposition ordered by the Court of Appeals in these cases is consistent with this court\u2019s prior decisions involving a defendant\u2019s successful challenge to an indictment based on an unconstitutionally vague statute. They rely on <em>State v. Robertson, </em>293 Or 402, 649 P2d 569 (1982) (trial court did not err in sustaining the defendant\u2019s demurrer to an indictment charging the defendant with violating an unconstitutionally overbroad statute); <em>State v. Spencer, </em>289 Or 225, 611 P2d 1147 (1980) (statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>violated free speech provision of Article I, section 8); and <em>State v. Blair, </em>287 Or 519, 601 P2d 766 (1979) (element of harassment held unconstitutionally vague under Article I, section 21). Those cases, however, are distinguishable and do not support the dismissal of the indictments ordered here by the Court of Appeals. In each of those cases, the constitutional problem affected the entire indictment, because the entire statute on which the charge was based was unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">In the instant cases, the vagueness defect affects only one allegation in each count of each indictment. Unlike the defendants in <em>Robertson, Spencer, </em>and <em>Blair, </em>defendants here do not argue that ORS 475.992, the underlying statute on which their indictments are based, is unconstitutional. Neither do they argue that the unchallenged allegations of their indictments fail to state a prosecutable offense under ORS 475.992. Defendants do not argue that the presence of the \u201cscheme or network\u201d allegation in the indictments affected the validity of the underlying drug convictions, <em>i.e., </em>defendants do not assign as error their convictions on the underlying offenses.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">In the absence of any basis for concluding that an error affected the validity of an underlying conviction, this court consistently has affirmed a conviction, insofar as it was not affected by the error, and remanded for resentencing. As long ago as <em>State v. Steeves, </em>29 Or 85, 43 P 947 (1896), <em>overruled on other grounds, State v. Allen, </em>301 Or 35, 717 P2d 1178 (1986), this court held that, where the indictment otherwise states a prosecutable offense, a defect in an indictment does not require that the conviction be reversed with directions to dismiss the indictment. In <em>Steeves, </em>the charged crime of murder was improperly pleaded, and the defendant was convicted of the lesser-included offense of manslaughter. In rejecting the defendant\u2019s challenge to the indictment, this court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b254-6\">\u201cIt is contended that the indictment does not charge murder in any degree, but this cannot avail the defendant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>for, having been convicted of manslaughter only, he can have no valid reason to question the sufficiency of the indictment for a failure to allege murder in either degree. The principle for which he contends implies that the facts constituting the crime of manslaughter are properly stated, and, having been convicted thereof, it is manifest that the indictment is sufficient to support the judgment.\u201d 29 Or at 87-88.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-4\"><em>See State v. Martin, </em>54 Or 403, 408, 100 P 1106, 103 P 512 (1909) (where an indictment for murder was sufficient to charge manslaughter, for which the defendant was convicted, its failure to sufficiently charge murder was not material).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\"><em>State v. Graves, </em>299 Or 189, 700 P2d 244 (1985), is very similar to the instant cases. In <em>Graves, </em>the defendant was indicted for first degree burglary based on an allegation of possession of a \u201cburglar\u2019s tool.\u201d The allegation had the effect of increasing by 15 years the penalty on conviction of burglary. As did defendants in this case, Graves argued that the allegation was unconstitutionally vague. The trial court disagreed, and Graves later was convicted of first degree burglary. The Court of Appeals affirmed. On review, this court, held that the \u201cburglar\u2019s tool\u201d allegation was unconstitutionally vague in violation of Article I, sections 20 and 21, of the Oregon Constitution. This court did not vacate Graves\u2019 conviction, however, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b255-6\">\u201cThe Court of Appeals is reversed and this case is remanded to the trial court. Because the jury necessarily must have found the defendant guilty of the crime of burglary in the second degree (a prerequisite for finding guilt on a burglary in the first degree charge), we direct the trial court to enter a judgment of conviction of the necessarily included crime of burglary in the second degree and impose an appropriate sentence therefor.\u201d 299 Or at 197.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">In <em>State v. Boots, </em>308 Or 371, 780 P2d 725 (1989), the defendant was convicted of aggravated murder after a jury trial. On appeal, this court found error with respect only to the allegation that elevated the defendant\u2019s offense from murder to aggravated murder. This court affirmed the defendant\u2019s conviction for murder and remanded the case to the trial court for the state to choose whether to reduce the defendant\u2019s conviction to murder and to impose sentence accordingly or to retry him for aggravated murder. 308 Or at 381. Similarly, in <em>State v. Wagner, </em>309 Or 5, 20, 786 P2d 93, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number><em>cert den, </em>498 US 879, 111 S Ct 212, 112 L Ed 2d 171 (1990), this court found error only as to the defendant\u2019s sentence of death for aggravated murder. This court rejected the defendant\u2019s argument that the penalty-phase error required the setting aside of his aggravated murder conviction, affirmed the aggravated murder conviction, and reversed and remanded only for a new penalty-phase proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-4\">We hold that where a defect related to an allegation such as is in issue here does not affect the validity of the conviction on any properly alleged underlying offense, the appropriate remedy is to affirm the conviction on the underlying offense and to remand for resentencing. Accordingly, in each of these 13 cases, we affirm the defendant\u2019s conviction on the underlying drug offense and remand to the trial court for resentencing, disregarding the \u201cscheme or network\u201d allegation.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">The decisions of the Court of Appeals are reversed. The judgments of conviction are affirmed and the cases are remanded to the circuit courts for resentencing.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b250-7\"> After this court allowed review in <em>Moeller, </em>the 1991 legislature superseded the penal provisions that gave rise to the challenge in that case. Accordingly, this court determined that the order allowing review should be dismissed. <em>State v. Moeller, </em>312 Or 76, 79, 815 P2d 701 (1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b250-8\"> <em>State v. Ferrell, </em>111 Or App 120, 822 P2d 1212 (1992); <em>State v.
