Herman appeals from the Order entered by the Eleventh Judicial District Court, Flathead County, dismissing his petition for postconviction relief. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-19\">\u00b62 The restated issues on appeal are:</p>\n<p id=\"b290-20\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err in dismissing the claims in Herman\u2019s petition for postconviction relief pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 46-21-104(l)(c) and - <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>201(l)(a), MCA?</p>\n<p id=\"b291-4\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by failing to hold an evidentiary hearing on Herman\u2019s petition?</p>\n<p id=\"b291-5\">\u00b65 3. Did the sentencing court err in imposing restitution as part of Herman\u2019s sentence?</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">\u00b66 In early 2001, the State of Montana charged Herman with the felony offense of robbery. Herman and the State entered into a plea agreement in August of 2001, pursuant to which Herman agreed to plead guilty to the felony offense of conspiracy to commit robbery, which carries a maximum prison term of 40 years. In exchange for Herman\u2019s guilty plea to that offense, the State agreed to recommend a sentence which included restitution, a 20-year prison term with 7 years suspended, and parole eligibility conditioned upon completing a particular chemical dependency treatment program.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">\u00b67 At the change of plea hearing, Herman testified about his involvement in an agreement to rob a casino and his reasons for pleading guilty. Determining Herman knowingly and voluntarily pled guilty and provided a sufficient factual basis to support the plea, the trial court convicted him of conspiracy to commit robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">\u00b68 At the sentencing hearing, the trial court stated its intent to deviate from the sentencing recommendation in the plea agreement by sentencing Herman to 20 years imprisonment with 13 years suspended, a 3V2-year parole eligibility restriction conditioned on completion of an unspecified chemical dependency treatment program, and the above-referenced restitution and other terms. The court afforded Herman an opportunity to consult with counsel and withdraw his guilty plea; he declined and the court sentenced him accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"Axlp\">\u00b69 Herman appealed, claiming only that the written sentence did not conform to the oral pronouncement of sentence. In an order dated November 26,2002, in Supreme Court cause number 01-907, we noted the State had conceded the point and remanded. On remand, an amended judgment and sentence was entered and Herman did not appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-10\">\u00b610 Herman subsequently filed a <em>pro se </em>petition for postconviction relief and a 35-page \u201cbrief\u2019 with attached documents. The three-page petition set forth a list of ten ineffective assistance of counsel claims, followed by a paragraph in which Herman claimed that, \u201cdue to the duress of imprisonment, severe amounts of stress, and insufficient legal representation,\u201d he \u201cma[d]e an improper decision to plead guilty.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>The petition cited to police reports attached to his brief, as well as to portions of the underlying record that were not attached. The brief included several factual allegations and at least one claim not contained in the petition; it cross-referenced several factual assertions to the attached materials.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">\u00b611 Herman also petitioned this Court for a writ of habeas corpus, challenging the restitution imposed as part of his amended sentence. We ordered that the habeas corpus petition be filed in the District Court as a petition for postconviction relief, and the District Court allowed Herman to add the restitution issue to his previously filed petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">\u00b612 The District Court ordered, and the State filed, a response to Herman\u2019s petition for postconviction relief. Thereafter, the court dismissed Herman\u2019s petition without a hearing. It determined all of Herman\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claims could have been raised on direct appeal; his factual allegations were not adequately supported by affidavits, records or other evidence; and his plea agreement and testimony at the change of plea hearing \u201cclearly would not support a finding of ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d It acknowledged, but declined to consider, an affidavit submitted by Herman\u2019s former counsel. The District Court did not address the restitution issue, although it noted in reciting the background of the case that another claim had been added to the petition for postconviction relief. Herman appeals, represented by the Appellate Defender. We set forth additional facts below.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">\u00b613 A district court may dismiss a petition for postconviction relief as a matter of law, and we review a court\u2019s conclusions of law for correctness. <em>See State v. Finley, </em>2002 MT 288, \u00b6 7, 312 Mont. 493, \u00b6 7, 59 P.3d 1132, \u00b6 7 (citations omitted). We review a court\u2019s decision regarding whether to hold an evidentiary hearing in a postconviction proceeding for abuse of discretion. <em>See Thurston v. State, </em>2004 MT 142, \u00b6 8, 321 Mont. 411, \u00b6 8, 91 P.3d 1259, \u00b6 8 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">\u00b614 <em>1. Did the District Court err in dismissing the claims in Herman\u2019s petition for postconviction relief pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 46-21-104(l)(c) and - 201(l)(a), MCA?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b292-10\">\u00b615 A petition for postconviction relief must \u201cidentify all facts supporting the grounds for relief set forth in the petition and have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>attached affidavits, records, or other evidence establishing the existence of those facts.\u201d Section 46-21-104(l)(c), MCA. A court may dismiss a petition for postconviction relief without holding an evidentiary hearing if the procedural threshold set forth in \u00a7 46-21-104(l)(c), MCA, is not satisfied. <em>See Finley, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 9-10 (citations omitted). In addition, a district court may dismiss a petition for postconviction relief without ordering a response if the petition, files and records \u201cconclusively show that the petitioner is not entitled to relief\u2019; alternatively, it may order a response and, after reviewing the response, \u201cdismiss the petition as a matter of law for failure to state a claim for relief or it may proceed to determine the issue.\u201d Section 46-21-201(l)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-4\">\u00b616 After reviewing the State\u2019s response, the District Court dismissed Herman\u2019s petition without a hearing. It reasoned, in part, that Herman had not satisfied the requirement of \u00a7 46-21-104(l)(c), MCA, to provide attachments establishing the existence of facts supporting the grounds for relief set forth in his petition. The court also determined the record did not support Herman\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-5\">\u00b617 On appeal, Herman asserts he \u201cmade a valiant effort\u201d to meet the \u201cattachments\u201d requirement of \u00a7 46-21-104(l)(c), MCA, and the District Corut \u201cignored the volume and content\u201d of his attachments and \u201cset an impossible standard\u201d for meeting that requirement. Section 46-21-104(l)(c), MCA, does not require volume; it requires that a petition identify all facts supporting the grounds for relief set forth in the petition and have attached affidavits, records or other evidence establishing those identified facts. Thus, our inquiry regarding \u00a7 46-21-104(l)(c), MCA, is whether Herman\u2019s attachments establish identified facts supporting the claims, or grounds for relief, set forth in his petition for postconviction relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">\u00b618 Herman\u2019s petition for postconviction relief asserted trial counsel was ineffective for: (a) failing to raise constitutional issues; (b) failing to raise the issue of bond reduction or pretrial release; (c) failing to object to <em>Brady </em>violations; (d) allowing known false statements to be used as evidence; (e) failing to move for dismissal or an evidentiary hearing about another suspect; (f) allowing the State to suppress tire track evidence; (g) failing to relay to Herman evidence gathered by counsel or the retained investigator; (h) failing to help Herman obtain medical assistance for anxiety; (i) allowing Herman to plead to a moot charge; and (j) allowing a speedy trial violation. As mentioned above, Herman asserted in a separate paragraph that the \u201cduress of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>imprisonment, severe amounts of stress, and insufficient legal representation caused him to falter, and make an improper decision to plead guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b294-4\">\u00b619 On appeal, Herman contends he made \u201ceight claims of error that lead [sic] to his guilty plea\u201d and provides a list that corresponds with the table of contents in his District Court brief, including one general ineffective assistance of counsel claim and seven purported stand-alone claims. We note \u00a7 46-21-104(l)(a), MCA, requires that the petition-not the supporting brief-must \u201cclearly set forth the alleged... violations[.]\u201d The supporting brief or memorandum is where legal arguments, citations and a discussion of the legal authorities must be advanced. Section 46-21-104(2), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">\u00b620 Regardless of whether the claims appeared in the petition or in the table of contents of the supporting brief, it is well-established that a person who has pled guilty to an offense generally may challenge only the knowing and voluntary nature of the plea. This is because a valid guilty plea constitutes a waiver of nonjurisdictional defects and defenses which occurred prior to the entry of the plea. <em>See, e.g., Ellenburg v. Chase, </em>2004 MT 66, \u00b6 21, 320 Mont. 315, \u00b6 21, 87 P.3d 473, \u00b6 21 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">\u00b621  Persons who have pled guilty to criminal offenses may also pursue ineffective assistance of counsel claims, however. <em>See, e.g., State v. Henderson, </em>2004 MT 173, \u00b6\u00b6 3-17, 322 Mont. 69, \u00b6\u00b6 3-17, 93 P.3d 1231, \u00b6\u00b6 3-17. Generally, in the context of a guilty plea, an individual asserting ineffective assistance of counsel may establish prejudice by demonstrating a reasonable probability that, but for errors by counsel, he or she would not have pled guilty and would have insisted on going to trial. <em>Henderson, </em>\u00b6 9 (citation omitted). By pleading guilty, Herman waived his right to challenge matters-including the seven stand-alone claims set forth in the table of contents of his District Court brief-which occurred prior to the guilty plea and are unrelated to the knowing or voluntary nature of his plea or his ineffective assistance of counsel claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">\u00b622 Herman does not substantively argue on appeal that the District Court improperly dismissed the following claims pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 46-21-104(l)(c) or -201(l)(a), MCA: counsel\u2019s alleged performance in relation to an asserted <em>Brady </em>violation; counsel\u2019s alleged failure to relay all evidence obtained by counsel or the defense\u2019s investigator regarding another person\u2019s possession of some robbery proceeds and a shotgun; and counsel\u2019s performance in relation to the allegedly moot conspiracy charge. In addition, Herman does not address counsel\u2019s alleged failure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>to raise \u201cconstitutional issues,\u201d other than arguments related to more specific claims addressed below. We do not consider unsupported arguments; nor do we have an obligation to formulate arguments or locate authorities for parties on appeal. <em>See State v. Kearney, </em>2005 MT 171, \u00b6 16, 327 Mont. 485, \u00b6 16, 115 P.3d 214, \u00b6 16 (citation omitted). Therefore, we decline to address these ineffective assistance of counsel claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-4\">\u00b623 Several of Herman\u2019s arguments on appeal relate to whether he provided sufficient attachments to support what he characterizes as \u201cweaknesses in the state\u2019s case.\u201d These \u201cweaknesses\u201d roughly correspond to some of the seven stand-alone claims set forth in the table of contents to Herman\u2019s District Court brief which, as stated above, Herman waived by pleading guilty. <em>See Ellenburg, </em>\u00b6 21 (citation omitted). Furthermore, absent a trial, we cannot know what the evidence would have been and, consequently, any assertion that the State could not prove all elements of the crime is mere speculation. <em>See State v. Graham, </em>2002 MT 237, \u00b6 13, 311 Mont. 500, \u00b6 13, 57 P.3d 54, \u00b6 13. Therefore, we decline to address asserted \u201cweaknesses\u201d in the State\u2019s anticipated evidence as stand-alone claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">\u00b624 Herman\u2019s assertions of \u201cweaknesses\u201d in the State\u2019s case might conceivably relate, however, to his ineffective assistance of counsel claims that counsel failed to move for dismissal of the charges or an evidentiary hearing regarding another suspect, \u201callowed known false statements to be used as evidence\u201d-even though no trial occurred and nothing was offered into evidence, and \u201callowed the State to suppress evidence of other tire tracks known to be at or around the crime scene\u201d-apparently referring to law enforcement\u2019s alleged failure to photograph tire tracks left by the bartender\u2019s car, her boyfriend\u2019s car and a patron\u2019s car. Herman provides no authority, as required by Rule 23(a)(4), M.R.App.P., for the proposition that counsel reasonably should have, or even could have, challenged evidence before trial in any manner other than through the motions counsel actually filed, such as the <em>Brady </em>motion to obtain witnesses\u2019 criminal histories and the motion to suppress photographic evidence. Nor does Herman provide authority for the proposition that an individual who has pled guilty to an offense may establish ineffective assistance of counsel merely by demonstrating \u201cweaknesses\u201d in the anticipated evidence. Thus, it is unnecessary to analyze whether Herman\u2019s attachments established the identified facts supporting his \u201cevidence\u201d-related ineffective assistance of counsel claims. We conclude dismissal of those claims was appropriate pursuant to the \u201cfailure to state a claim for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>relief\u2019 standard in \u00a7 46-21-20l(l)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-4\">\u00b625 Herman also advances arguments that relate primarily to the separate one-paragraph claim in his petition that he pled guilty due to \u201cinsufficient legal representation\u201d and his assertion that the District Court erred in concluding his attached materials were insufficient under \u00a7 46-21-104(l)(c), MCA, in this regard. Specifically, he contends his letters to counsel demonstrate counsel\u2019s \u201cunresponsiveness,\u201d letters from his mother and sister and his letters to his sister show he was attempting to find legal information, and his letter to his sister and an unsworn online ACLU complaint form establish that he told his sister and the ACLU that counsel had told him he would \u201cget hammered\u201d if he went to trial. We address these assertions in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">\u00b626 Regarding Herman\u2019s argument that his attachments demonstrate counsel was \u201cunresponsive,\u201d his attached letters to counsel establish nothing at all about counsel\u2019s responsiveness. His claim that counsel did not assist him in obtaining medical assistance is similarly unsupported. We conclude, pursuant to the \u201cattachments\u201d requirement of \u00a7 46-21-104(l)(c), MCA, that the District Court correctly dismissed the claim that Herman pled guilty due to \u201cinsufficient legal representation\u201d based on counsel\u2019s alleged unresponsiveness and failure to assist him in obtaining medical help.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">\u00b627  Herman\u2019s argument that his attachments show he requested assistance in conducting legal research is correct. He provides no authority, however, as required by Rule 23(a)(4), M.R.App.P., for the proposition that a person can establish ineffective assistance of counsel simply by demonstrating he or she performed or sought independent legal research. Thus, we conclude that, insofar as Herman\u2019s \u201cinsufficient legal representation\u201d claim is based on the factual assertion that he conducted, sought or obtained independent legal research, that claim was properly dismissed pursuant to \u00a7 46-21-201(l)(a), MCA, for failure to state a claim for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">\u00b628  We next consider Herman\u2019s argument that his attached letter to his sister and the unsworn online ACLU complaint form show he told others that counsel had advised him he would \u201cget hammered\u201d if he went to trial. These attachments establish, at most, that he told others about counsel\u2019s alleged advice; they do not establish that trial counsel actually made the \u201cget hammered\u201d statement. Thus, we conclude the District Court correctly determined Herman did not meet the \u201cattachments\u201d requirement of \u00a7 46-21-104(l)(c), MCA, with respect to this alleged statement and Herman\u2019s related \u201cinsufficient legal representation\u201d claim. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>\u00b629 Moreover, with regard to the \u201cget hammered\u201d statement and alleged advice from counsel that a pending suppression motion likely would be denied, Herman neither argues nor advances authority for the proposition that relaying unfavorable information to a client and evaluating a case in light of the evidence could constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. Rule 1.4(a)(3) of the Montana Rules of Professional Conduct provides that counsel is obligated to keep a client informed about the status of a matter. Moreover, criminal defense counsel has a duty to inform his or her client of the elements of the offense, the possible punishment and the advisability of a plea agreement. <em>State v. Thee, </em>2001 MT 294, \u00b6 13, 307 Mont. 450, \u00b6 13, 37 P.3d 741, \u00b6 13 (citation omitted). Therefore, we conclude Herman\u2019s \u201cinsufficient legal representation\u201d claim, insofar as it relates to the alleged \u201cget hammered\u201d statement and advice regarding the motion, was properly dismissed pursuant to \u00a7 46-21-20l(l)(a), MCA, for failure to state a claim for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-4\">\u00b630 Finally, several of Herman\u2019s arguments on appeal relate, directly or indirectly, to the claims in his petition that he pled guilty due to \u201csevere amounts of stress\u201d and that counsel was ineffective for failing to move for bond reduction or release and for allowing a speedy trial violation. Specifically, he contends his attachments establish he suffered anxiety.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-5\">\u00b631 We need not address whether Herman met the \u201cattachments\u201d requirement of \u00a7 46-21-104(l)(c), MCA, in establishing that he suffered anxiety at the time of his plea, because the record supports that fact. At his sentencing hearing, which occurred approximately one month after his guilty plea, Herman testified, \u201cI have been drug-free-I am on medication right now for anxiety, but that\u2019s nothing really serious.\u201d Moreover, we often have recognized that anxiety and concern are inherent in being charged with a crime. <em>See, e.g., State v. Jefferson, </em>2003 MT 90, \u00b6 32, 315 Mont. 146, \u00b6 32, 69 P.3d 641, \u00b6 32 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">\u00b632  Our inquiry does not end there, however, because Herman\u2019s main anxiety-related claim was that he pled guilty due to the duress of incarceration, not simply that he suffered anxiety. In his attached letters to his sister and in one letter to counsel, Herman mentioned his anxiety, once characterizing it as \u201cway past normal amounts and ... closing on out of controll [sic]!\u201d He did not, however, attach any medical records, affidavits or other evidence to establish that his anxiety compromised his ability to plead guilty or, despite anxiety medication, affected him when he declined the District Court\u2019s offer to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>withdraw his guilty plea at his sentencing hearing. Therefore, we conclude the District Court properly dismissed Herman\u2019s main anxiety claim-that he pled guilty due to the duress of incarceration-for failure to meet the \u201cattachments\u201d requirement of \u00a7 46-21-104(l)(c), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"A_A\">\u00b633  With regard to Herman\u2019s claim that counsel failed to move for a bond reduction or pretrial release, he could only succeed with this claim by demonstrating his plea resulted from that alleged failure. <em>See Henderson, </em>\u00b6 9. The only possible relationship between counsel\u2019s alleged failure to move for a bond reduction and the guilty plea is Herman\u2019s assertion that he suffered incarceration-related anxiety that caused him to plead guilty. We have already determined, however, that Herman did not meet the requirements of \u00a7 46-21-104(l)(c), MCA, with respect to establishing he pled guilty due to anxiety resulting from incarceration. Thus, because Herman has not established his guilty plea resulted from anxiety, he similarly cannot establish that counsel\u2019s alleged failure to move for a bond reduction related to his initial guilty plea or his decision to proceed with the guilty plea when the District Court afforded him the opportunity to withdraw it. We conclude, pursuant to \u00a7 46-21-104(l)(c), MCA, that the District Court properly dismissed the ineffective assistance of counsel claim for failure to move for bond reduction or pretrial release.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\">\u00b634 Regarding the claim that counsel was ineffective in failing to assert a speedy trial violation, Herman argues on appeal that the procedural bar of \u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA-which prohibits petitioners from raising, and courts from addressing, matters that reasonably could have been raised on direct appeal-does not apply because counsel\u2019s reasons for acting or failing to act are not of record; his \u201callegations about speedy trial violations involved previously unknown descriptions of anxiety and stress\u201d; and he provided sufficient attachments, as required by \u00a7 46-21-104(l)(c), MCA, to support his \u201callegations about speedy trial violations.\u201d As noted above, Herman waived his right to raise a speedy trial violation as a stand-alone claim when he pled guilty. <em>See Ellenburg, </em>\u00b6 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">\u00b635  Insofar as Herman\u2019s arguments on appeal refer to his \u201cspeedy trial\u201d ineffective assistance of counsel claim, the relevant factual contentions in his District Court brief were that counsel had advised him \u201cthat in the State of Montana, Speedy Trial is within 274 or 276 days, not 180 days\u201d; Herman took what he considered to be a tactical plea \u201cafter realizing that his court appointed attorney was not defending his client\u2019s constitutional rights\u201d; and Herman did not agree when trial counsel moved to continue an imminent, trial date because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>of late-received evidence from the crime lab, with the delay attributed to the State for speedy trial purposes. Other than the attached letters referring to anxiety, mentioned above, Herman provided no attachments to support these specific factual contentions about himself and counsel, as required by \u00a7 46-21-104(l)(c), MCA. The only possibly relevant attachment is Herman\u2019s letter to counsel, written approximately 195 days after his arrest and 19 days before he pled guilty, in which he described his anxiety and raised the issue of a possible speedy trial violation. This letter provides no support for his factual allegations and, indeed, clarifies Herman was aware of his counsel\u2019s failure to assert a speedy trial violation at the time he pled guilty and testified he was satisfied with counsel\u2019s services. We conclude the District Court properly dismissed the \u201cspeedy trial\u201d ineffective assistance of counsel claim pursuant to \u00a7 46-21-104(l)(c), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-4\">\u00b636 We hold the District Court did not err in dismissing the claims in Herman\u2019s petition for postconviction relief pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 46-21-104(l)(c) and -201(l)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">\u00b637 <em>2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by failing to hold an evidentiary hearing?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">\u00b638 The District Court dismissed Herman\u2019s petition, pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 46-21-104(l)(c) and -201(l)(a), MCA, without an evidentiary hearing. As stated above, a court may dismiss a claim without a hearing for failure to meet the procedural threshold of \u00a7 46-21-104(l)(c), MCA. <em>See Finley, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 9-10. Furthermore, a court may, after reviewing an ordered responsive pleading, \u201cdismiss the petition as a matter of law for failure to state a claim for relief!.]\u201d Section 46-21-201(l)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">\u00b639 On appeal, Herman does not assert error in our determination in <em>Finley, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 9-14, that a district court may dismiss a petition without a hearing for failure to meet the \u201cattachments\u201d procedural threshold of \u00a7 46-21-104(l)(c), MCA. Therefore, pursuant to <em>Finley, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 9-14, we conclude no hearing was required to dismiss the claims discussed above that did not meet the \u201cattachments\u201d requirement of \u00a7 46-21-104(l)(c), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">\u00b640 Herman contends, however, that he was entitled to further prosecute his other claims because the \u201cfailure to state a claim for relief\u2019 standard set forth in \u00a7 46-21-201(l)(a), MCA, is nearly identical to the Rule 12(b)(6), M.R.Civ.P., provision allowing a complaint to be dismissed for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. He asserts Rule 12(b)(6), M.R.Civ.P., standards-that allegations in a petition for postconviction relief must be taken as true and construed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>in a light most favorable to the petitioner-apply, and that applying Rule 12(b)(6), M.R.Civ.P., standards is not inconsistent with the postconviction statutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">\u00b641 Recognizing that we recently rejected an identical argument in Ellenburg, \u00b6\u00b6 11-12, Herman asserts that opinion leaves the standard for reviewing a petition for postconviction relief in a \u201cstate of confusion.\u201d We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">\u00b642 In <em>Ellenburg, </em>\u00b6 11, a petitioner for postconviction relief argued on appeal that the standard for dismissing a petition for postconviction relief without a hearing was identical to the standard for dismissing a civil complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), M.R.Civ.P. He further asserted that, for that reason, we were required to construe his petition in the light most favorable to him and take the factual allegations in his petition as true. <em>Ellenburg, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">\u00b643 Addressing this argument, we observed that, pursuant to \u00a7 46-21-201(l)(c), MCA, the rules of civil procedure apply in postconviction proceedings only if they are consistent with the express provisions of the postconviction statutes. <em>See Ellenburg, </em>\u00b6 12. We noted that, \u201c[ujnlike civil complaints, the postconviction statutes are demanding in their pleading requirements.\u201d We pointed to \u00a7 46-21-104(1), MCA, which requires, among other things, that a petition for postconviction relief \u201cclearly set forth the alleged ... violations\u201d and include attachments establishing identified facts supporting the grounds for relief. We also observed \u00a7 46-21-104(2), MCA, states that a petition-unlike a civil complaint-must be accompanied by a supporting memorandum. <em>See Ellenburg, </em>\u00b6 12. We concluded that, \u201cbecause the testing of the sufficiency of postconviction claims is directed by the more specific provisions of the postconviction statutes, the traditional civil law standards for testing the sufficiency of claims is [sic] unavailable to postconviction petitioners.\u201d <em>Ellenburg, </em>\u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">\u00b644 In asserting <em>Ellenburg </em>creates \u201cconfusion\u201d about postconviction proceedings, Herman highlights our statement <em>inEllenburg, </em>\u00b6 12, that a petitioner for postconviction relief has the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that he or she is entitled to relief. He correctly notes that burden of proof applies in both traditional civil cases and postconviction proceedings. Indeed, there may be other instances in which the rules of civil procedure are <em>not </em>inconsistent with the statutes controlling postconviction proceedings. Our reasoning in <em>Ellenburg, </em>however, was that the express statutory requirements set forth in \u00a7 46-21-104, MCA, significantly exceed-and are inconsistent with-the mere notice pleading requirements for an ordinary complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>in a civil action. <em>See </em>Rule 8(a), M.R.Civ.P.; <em>Kunst v. Pass, </em>1998 MT 71, \u00b6 35, 288 Mont. 264, \u00b6 35, 957 P.2d 1, \u00b6 35 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b301-4\">\u00b645  Dismissals for \u201cfailure to state a claim\u201d in postconviction proceedings also differ from those in ordinary civil cases because, pursuant to the clear language of \u00a7 46-21-201(l)(a), MCA, a district court may dismiss a petition for postconviction relief after reviewing the record. By contrast, a court generally may consider only the contents of a civil complaint-and nothing more-in addressing a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), M.R.Civ.P., for failure to state a claim. <em>See Stokes v. State ex rel. Dep. of Transp., </em>2005 MT 42, \u00b6 7, 326 Mont. 138, \u00b6 7, 107 P.3d 494, \u00b6 7 (citation omitted). Applying \u00a7 46-21-201(l)(c), MCA, we conclude again-as we did in Ellenburg-that Rule 12(b)(6), M.R.Civ.P., standards do not apply to dismissals of petitions for postconviction relief for failure to state a claim because they are inconsistent with the more specific requirements of \u00a7\u00a7 46-21-104 and -201(l)(a), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\">\u00b646 We address other tangential arguments only briefly. Relying on <em>Cooper v. State </em>(Idaho 1975), 531 P.2d 1187, Herman asserts other jurisdictions apply Rule 12(b)(6), M.R.Civ.P., standards in postconviction proceedings. <em>Cooper, </em>a three-decades-old decision from another jurisdiction, does not address Montana\u2019s postconviction statutes and is not persuasive. Our recent decision in <em>Ellenburg </em>is controlling authority in Montana.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">\u00b647 Next, Herman sets forth cases in which we have noted a district court\u2019s application of Rule 56(c), M.R.Civ.P., summary judgment standards in postconviction proceedings. He asserts that, because Rules 12(b)(6) and 56(c), M.R.Civ.P., are \u201cintertwined,\u201d Rule 12(b)(6), M.R.Civ.P., standards must also apply in postconviction proceedings. The relationship between motions to dismiss and summary judgment motions in the traditional civil law context has no impact on our conclusion in <em>Ellenburg </em>\u2014 or our reasoning here \u2014 that the usual civil law dismissal standards do not apply in postconviction proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">\u00b648 Herman also contends <em>State v. Schaff, </em>2001 MT 130, 305 Mont. 427, 28 P.3d 1073, and <em>State v. Lawrence, </em>2001 MT 299, 307 Mont. 487, 38 P.3d 809, support his position that \u201c[p]otential postconviction claims should be resolved on the merits\u201d and, therefore, an evidentiary hearing was required in his case prior to dismissal of his petition for failure to state a claim for relief. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">\u00b649 At the outset, we observe Herman\u2019s characterization of <em>Schaff and Lawrence </em>is far too broad. Indeed, as discussed above, the general rules regarding evidentiary hearings on postconviction claims are set forth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>in statutes and case law. Section 46-21-104(l)(c), MCA, clearly provides that a petition for postconviction relief must satisfy the threshold requirements set forth therein with regard to establishing the facts at issue via affidavit and/or other evidence. Allegations do not constitute the statutorily required \u201cevidence,\u201d and where the requirement of \u00a7 46-21-104(l)(c), MCA, is not met, the petitioner is not entitled to an evidentiary hearing. <em>Finley, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 9-10. Section 46-21-201(l)(a), MCA, just as clearly authorizes a district court to dismiss a petition for postconviction relief as a matter of law for failure to state a claim. Moreover, under our interpretations of the postconviction statutes, a district court may dismiss a petition based solely on the files and records of the case. <em>See Griffin v. State, </em>2003 MT 267, \u00b6 12, 317 Mont. 457, \u00b6 12, 77 P.3d 545, \u00b6 12 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\">\u00b650 It is true that, in both <em>Schaff </em>and <em>Lawrence, </em>we remanded for evidentiary hearings; we did so, however, based on relatively unique circumstances. In <em>Schaff, </em>the petitioner alleged on appeal-as he had in the district court-that his plea was not voluntary because counsel misled him into believing that, despite his desire for new counsel and potential entitlement to same, he was required to proceed with current counsel. <em>Schaff, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 4, 6-9. Denominating it a \u201cclose question,\u201d we remanded for an evidentiary hearing. <em>Schaff, </em>\u00b6 10. Here, Herman has abandoned the passing assertion in his District Court brief that trial counsel advised him he was not entitled to new counsel by not referencing \u2014 or arguing \u2014 it on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">\u00b651 In <em>Lawrence, </em>the petitioner claimed on appeal that, while she was aware the sentencing recommendation in her proposed plea agreement was not binding on the trial court, her counsel knew in advance that the judge was not going to follow the recommendation and did not advise her. <em>Lawrence, </em>\u00b6 11. Because a failure to fully advise a client of rights and consequences surrounding the advisability of a guilty plea might constitute ineffective assistance, we remanded for an evidentiary hearing. <em>Lawrence, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 14-16. Here, Herman does not make any claim that counsel failed to fully advise him of the consequences of his guilty plea, much less the particular claim at issue in <em>Lawrence. </em>Thus, <em>Lawrence </em>has no application here.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">\u00b652  We hold the District Court did not abuse its discretion by failing to hold an evidentiary hearing on Herman\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">\u00b653 <em>3. Did the sentencing court err in imposing restitution as part of Herman\u2019s sentence?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">\u00b654 Noting the District Comet failed to address his restitution claim in dismissing his petition for postconviction relief, Herman contends the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>sentencing court erred in imposing restitution as part of his amended suspended sentence because \u00a7 46-18-201(5), MCA (1999), ostensibly authorizes the imposition of restitution only as part of a deferred sentence. He requests that we decide the restitution issue on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-4\">\u00b655 In postconviction proceedings, \u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA, precludes consideration of a claim that reasonably could have been raised on direct appeal. A defendant who pleads guilty to an offense may challenge the legality of the sentence on direct appeal, even absent an objection at sentencing. <em>See, e.g., State v. Erickson, </em>2005 MT 276, \u00b6 27, 329 Mont. 192, \u00b6 27, 124 P.3d 119, \u00b6 27; <em>State v. Eaton, </em>2004 MT 283, \u00b6\u00b6 14-16, 323 Mont. 287, \u00b6\u00b6 14-16, 99 P.3d 661, \u00b6\u00b6 14-16. Herman provides no authority or argument that his sentencing claim could not have been raised on direct appeal in the same maimer he raised his other sentence-related issue. Thus, we conclude \u00a7 46-21-105(2), MCA, bars Herman\u2019s sentencing claim and we decline to address it on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\">\u00b656 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b303-6\">JUSTICES WARNER, LEAPHART, COTTER and NELSON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
