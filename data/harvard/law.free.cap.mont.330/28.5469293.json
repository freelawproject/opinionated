We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-9\">\u00b62 We address the following issue on appeal: Did the District Court err in concluding that Lenora was competent to execute documents which affected the transactions at issue?</p>\n<p id=\"b51-10\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b51-11\">\u00b63 Lenora brought this action in the District Court against her deceased husband Bill\u2019s estate, Bill\u2019s two adult children, Gerald Rutledge and Cheryl Anderson, and Bill\u2019s grandchild, Kelly Rutledge (collectively, \u201cthe Rutledges\u201d). The Complaint sought to cancel a quitclaim deed to real property, to cancel the transfer of a vehicle title and to recover funds transferred from a joint bank account. Several months after the Complaint was filed, Scott Stave, Lenora\u2019s son, was appointed as her conservator and substituted as the plaintiff in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b51-12\">\u00b64 Bill and Lenora were married in 1985 when Bill was 62 and Lenora was 64. This was the second marriage for Bill and the third for Lenora. Bill and Lenora each had adult children from their prior <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>marriages. Gerald Rutledge and Cheryl Anderson are Bill\u2019s children from his first marriage. Kelly Rutledge is Gerald\u2019s son and Bill\u2019s grandson. Scott Stave, Jim Stave, Judy Jurenka, Gwen Kane, Ron Sternberg and Marilyn Williamson are Lenora\u2019s children from her previous marriages.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-4\">\u00b65 Lenora and Bill each had assets at the time they married. After their marriage, Bill sold his farm and the home on it and he and Lenora lived in Lenora\u2019s home in Big Sandy. In 1987, Bill bought real property in Lake County. Although there was some evidence that Bill paid for this property entirely from his own funds, the deed was prepared in the names of Bill and Lenora as joint tenants with the right of survivorship.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-5\">\u00b66 During their marriage, Bill and Lenora opened and maintained a number of bank accounts at Wells Fargo Bank in Big Sandy. The accounts were variously opened as \u201cBill and/or Lenora Rutledge\u201d or \u201cLenora and/or Bill Rutledge.\u201d Diana Webster, a bank employee, testified that the first person named on an account signified who opened the account and who the bank considered the owner as between Bill and Lenora. However, Webster also testified that because they were joint accounts, either party could remove funds from these accounts.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-6\">\u00b67 In the early part of 2001, Bill was diagnosed with malignant cancer. His physicians advised him that he could expect to live for only another six months. After receiving this news, Bill and Lenora began to make known their estate planning desires and to take steps to memorialize their wishes. As part of that process, Bill asked his son Gerald to contact attorney Tom Sheehy to prepare Living Wills and Powers of Attorney for both Bill and Lenora.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-7\">\u00b68 Bill was hospitalized in April 2001. On April 30, 2001, a meeting took place in Bill\u2019s hospital room involving Bill, Lenora, Sheehy and some of Bill\u2019s and Lenora\u2019s children. At this meeting, Bill told the group how he and Lenora would like certain portions of their property distributed. Bill requested that Sheehy prepare a new deed for the property in Lake County wherein the property would be held by Bill and Lenora as tenants in common with the property 60% in Bill\u2019s name and 40% in Lenora\u2019s name. Bill also stated that Lenora was to receive Bill\u2019s Ford Expedition and Bill\u2019s grandson Kelly was to receive Bill\u2019s pickup.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-8\">\u00b69 After this meeting, Sheehy prepared a quitclaim deed for the lake property transferring it from Bill and Lenora as joint tenants with the. right of survivorship to Bill and Lenora as tenants in common with a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>60/40 division of interest. Both Bill and Lenora signed the new deed in Sheeh/s presence on May 7, 2001. A few days later, Webster went to the hospital to obtain Bill\u2019s and Lenora\u2019s signatures to transfer the vehicle titles.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-4\">\u00b610 Bill also had Webster transfer funds from one of their joint bank accounts to an account in his name along with the names of Gerald and Cheryl. Bill passed away on May 10,2001, and a part of the funds in this account were used to pay the expenses of Bill\u2019s last illness and his burial.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">\u00b611 On February 11,2002, Lenora filed her Complaint in this matter wherein she maintained that she was \u201cmentally infirm\u201d at the time of the April 30, 2001 meeting and incapable of transacting business or entering into agreements. Several months after the Complaint was filed, Lenora\u2019s son Scott was appointed as her Conservator and substituted as the plaintiff in this action.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">\u00b612 Following a bench trial, at which the District Court received extensive testimony, the court determined that although Lenora\u2019s medical records showed some problems with memory, there was no finding of incompetency in May 2001, when the deed and the titles were executed, and that a finding by the court in July 2002, that a conservator should be appointed for Lenora did not establish her incompetency in May 2001. The court farther determined that there was sufficient credible evidence from several witnesses establishing that Lenora understood and appreciated the transactions at issue and that they reflected her wishes. Hence, the court concluded that Scott had not met his burden of proof that Lenora lacked competency to effect the transfers. The court entered judgment in favor of the Rutledges and Scott appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b53-8\">\u00b613 We review a district court\u2019s findings of fact to determine whether those findings are clearly erroneous. <em>Pankratz Farms, Inc. v. Pankratz, </em>2004 MT 180, \u00b6 44, 322 Mont. 133, \u00b6 44, 95 P.3d 671, \u00b6 44 (citing <em>Hidden Hollow Ranch v. Fields, </em>2004 MT 153, \u00b6 21, 321 Mont. 505, \u00b6 21, 92 P.3d 1185, \u00b6 21). A district court\u2019s findings are clearly erroneous if substantial credible evidence does not support them, if the trial court has misapprehended the effect of the evidence or if a review of the record leaves this Court with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. <em>Pankratz, </em>\u00b6 44 (citing <em>Ray v. Nansel, </em>2002 MT 191, \u00b6 19, 311 Mont. 135, \u00b6 19, 53 P.3d 870, \u00b6 19). In determining whether a trial court\u2019s findings are supported by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>substantial credible evidence, this Court views the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party. <em>DeNiro v. Gasvoda, </em>1999 MT 129, \u00b6 9, 294 Mont. 478, \u00b6 9, 982 P.2d 1002, \u00b6 9 (citing <em>Roberts v. Mission Valley Concrete Industries </em>(1986), 222 Mont. 268, 271, 721 P.2d 355, 357).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-4\">\u00b614 In addition, we review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law for correctness. <em>Pankratz, </em>\u00b6 44 (citing <em>Hidden Hollow, </em>\u00b6 21).</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">\u00b615 <em>Did the District Court err in concluding that Lenora was competent to execute documents which affected the transactions at issue?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">\u00b616 Scott argues on appeal that the totality of the evidence supports a finding that by the time the deed and the vehicle titles were signed, Lenora had lost the ability to reason and to make informed judgments and was thus incapable of understanding the nature of the transactions at issue and to make reasoned decisions concerning them.</p>\n<p id=\"Aqq\">\u00b617 The Rutledges argue, on the other hand, that the District Court\u2019s decision is supported by the record, that Scott did not meet his burden of proof to establish that Lenora was incompetent when she signed the deed and the title to the pickup, and that Scott is barred by estoppel from asserting that the deed and the title should be set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-8\">\u00b618  After an extensive review of the record in this case, we hold that there was sufficient credible evidence to support the District Court\u2019s determination that Lenora was competent to execute the documents in question. While Lenora\u2019s medical records indicate that she had been diagnosed with early Alzheimer\u2019s, her medical records also indicate that it was the mildest form of the disease until October or November 2001, six months after Bill\u2019s death. Moreover, a conservator was not appointed for Lenora until July 2002, more than a year after Bill\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-9\">\u00b619 In <em>Matter of Estate of West </em>(1994), 269 Mont. 83, 95, 887 P.2d 222, 229, we noted that the fact that an individual has mental health problems does not per se make him or her incompetent. We have also pointed out that even the fact that a conservator has been appointed does not mean that a protected person lacks the capacity to make certain decisions, including executing a will. <em>West, </em>269 Mont. at 95,887 P.2d at 229; <em>In re Estate of Prescott, </em>2000 MT 200, 300 Mont. 469, 8 P.3d 88; \u00a7 72-5-421(5), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-10\">\u00b620 In this case, there were no findings in any of Lenora\u2019s medical records that she was incompetent at the time the deed and the titles <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>were signed. Even though Lenora\u2019s physician, Dr. Forrest Lanchbury, testified at trial that Lenora was incompetent, he had Lenora sign an informed consent for a medical procedure only a few days before she signed the deed and the titles. In addition, Dr. Lanchbury testified that the death of a spouse can accelerate dementia.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-4\">\u00b621 \u201cExpert testimony is opinion evidence which the finder of fact is entitled to disregard if it finds the testimony unpersuasive.\u201d <em>Koeppen v. Bolich, </em>2003 MT 313, \u00b6 51, 318 Mont. 240, \u00b6 51, 79 P.3d 1100, \u00b6 51 <em>(quoting Magart v. Schank, </em>2000 MT 279, \u00b6 10, 302 Mont. 151, \u00b6 10, 13 P.3d 390, \u00b6 10). As the Rutledges point out in their brief on appeal, Dr. Lanchbury\u2019s actions at the time the deed was signed were far more indicative of his view of Lenora\u2019s mental state than an opinion created many months later. Had Dr. Lanchbury felt that Lenora was not competent, he would not have solicited and accepted an informed consent from her.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-5\">\u00b622 The District Court heard conflicting testimony regarding Lenora\u2019s mental capacity. However, as we have frequently held, the District Court is in the best position to observe and examine the demeanor and candor of the witnesses, judge their credibility, and decide whether the plaintiffs have met their burden of proof, therefore, we will not second guess the District Court\u2019s determination regarding the strength and weight of conflicting testimony. <em>In re Marriage of Mease, </em>2004 MT 59, \u00b6 50, 320 Mont. 229, \u00b6 50, 92 P.3d 1148, \u00b6 50 (citing <em>Double AA Corp. v. Newland &amp; Co. </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 486, 494, 905 P.2d 138, 142).</p>\n<p id=\"Az\">\u00b623  Furthermore, a party asserting incompetence bears the burden of proof on that point. Sections 26-1-401 and 402, MCA; <em>Koerner v. Northern Pac. Ry. Co. </em>(1919), 56 Mont. 511, 186 P. 337. We agree with the District Court that Scott failed to meet his burden in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"A3E\">\u00b624 Consequently, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, the Rutledges, as we are constrained to do, <em>Deniro, </em>\u00b6 9, we hold that there was sufficient credible evidence to support the District Court\u2019s determination and that the District Court did not misapprehend the effect of that evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">\u00b625  Accordingly, we hold that the District Court did not err in concluding that Lenora was competent to execute the documents which affected the transactions at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">\u00b626 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b55-9\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES WARNER, LEAPHART and COTTER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
