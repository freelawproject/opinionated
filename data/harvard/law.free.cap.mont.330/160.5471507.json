There is not agreement amongst these members as to the basis for reversal, however. Therefore, Justice James C. Nelson (joined by Justice Patricia O. Cotter) and Justice W. William Leaphart (joined by Justice Brian M. Morris) each specially and separately concur that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>cause be reversed and remanded for a new trial.

The issues on appeal are:</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">\u00b65 1. Does Newman\u2019s appellate brief adhere to the Montana Rules of</p>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">Appellate Procedure?</p>\n<p id=\"b183-9\">\u00b66 2. Should this Court review Newman\u2019s claims pursuant to the doctrine of plain error review?</p>\n<p id=\"b183-10\">\u00b67 3. Did the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument deprive Newman of afair trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b183-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b183-12\">\u00b68 In June of 2003, Newman resided in her house in Stevensville, along with her two children, Amber and Mike, and her brother, Randy Jordan (Jordan). Also living at the house was a girl named Miranda, who was one of Amber\u2019s friends. Arthur Adler, who went by the nickname \u201cButch,\u201d had previously lived at the house. He was Newman\u2019s boyfriend, and he passed away in May of 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-13\">\u00b69 Jordan became a suspect in an investigation regarding a burglary at Ace Hardware in Stevensville. Pursuant to this investigation, law enforcement officers executed a search warrant on Newman\u2019s house on June 12, 2003. Detective Scott Burlingham, of the Ravalli County Sheriffs Office, was among the officers who searched the house. During his search, he found a bag of marijuana. He then stopped the search and applied for another search warrant based on this discovery. After securing the additional warrant, Detective Burlingham continued the search, finding drug paraphernalia and more marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"AMK\">\u00b610 As a result of the search, Newman was charged with criminal distribution of dangerous drugs, criminal possession of dangerous drugs, criminal possession of dangerous drugs with intent to distribute, and criminal possession of drug paraphernalia.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-14\">\u00b611 After the search of Newman\u2019s house, law enforcement officers apprehended Jordan and found marijuana in the car he was riding in. Jordan initially admitted that all the drugs at Newman\u2019s house belonged to him. However, he subsequently reached an agreement with the State whereby he agreed to testify against Newman in exchange for the State\u2019s promise to recommend a thirty-year suspended sentence in his criminal prosecution. Pursuant to this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>agreement, Jordan testified that the marijuana at Newman\u2019s house belonged to her, and that she sold marijuana frequently. Harold and Mary Jane Rice, Newman\u2019s neighbors, testified that people would come and go from Newman\u2019s house frequently, but admitted that they did not observe any drug transactions. Newman testified that heavy traffic at her home consisted of her friends who were visiting out of concern for her well-being subsequent to Arthur Adler\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">\u00b612 During the State\u2019s closing argument, the prosecutor repeatedly criticized Newman for her failure to call witnesses to corroborate her testimony. Newman\u2019s counsel did not raise an objection to these comments. Newman was found guilty on all four charges and was subsequently sentenced. Newman now appeals, arguing that the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument amounted to misconduct which denied her a fair trial. Newman also argues that her trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">\u00b613 <em>1. Does Newman\u2019s appellate brief adhere to the Montana Rules of Appellate Procedure?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">\u00b614 The State argues that Newman has failed to adhere to Rule 23(a)(4), M.R.App.P., in asserting her claim of prosecutorial misconduct. Specifically, the State points to the argument section of Newman\u2019s brief, and contends that Newman has failed to cite the trial transcript for the contested portions of the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument. As a result, the State asserts, this Court is \u201crequired to scour the transcript to find the alleged quotes.\u201d Thus, the State contends that we should refuse to address Newman\u2019s arguments regarding prosecutorial misconduct for failure to cite to the transcript.</p>\n<p id=\"Ale\">\u00b615 Rule 23(a)(3), M.R.App.P., requires that an appellant\u2019s brief contain a statement of the facts which includes citations to the record. Rule 23(a)(4), M.R.App.P., requires that the argument section of an appellant\u2019s brief contain citations to the pages of the record relied on. The statement of facts in Newman\u2019s brief contains a verbatim recitation of the contested portions of the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, accompanied by accurate citations to the corresponding pages in the trial transcript. The argument section of Newman\u2019s brief refers to these same transcript excerpts, but does not cite to the transcript in each instance. While the argument section of Newman\u2019s brief could have been slightly more clear with additional transcript citations, we certainly are not required to \u201cscour the transcript to find <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>the alleged quotes,\u201d as the State asserts. As such, I conclude that Newman has satisfied the requirement of Rule 23(a)(4), M.R.App.P.</p>\n<p id=\"AjQ\">\u00b616 <em>2. Should this Court review Newman\u2019s claims pursuant to the doctrine of plain error review?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">\u00b617 Newman argues thatthe prosecutor\u2019s closing argument amounted to misconduct which denied her a fair trial and due process by violating her right to be presumed innocent and undermining the State\u2019s burden to prove every element of the charged offenses beyond a reasonable doubt. Acknowledging her trial counsel\u2019s failure to object to the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, Newman requests that we employ the doctrine of plain error to review her contentions on appeal. The State argues that plain error review is inappropriate because Newman\u2019s claims are not supported by the record. As discussed hereinafter, I conclude that Newman\u2019s claims are, in fact, supported by the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">\u00b618 Typically, the failure to timely object to an alleged impropriety in the district court precludes this Court from reviewing the issue on appeal. Section 46-20-104(2), MCA. However, the common law doctrine of plain error review provides that this Court may, in certain circumstances, review a claim of alleged error even where no contemporaneous objection was made in the district court. <em>State v. Finley </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 126, 137, 915 P.2d 208, 215 <em>(overruled in part on other grounds by State v. Gallagher, </em>2001 MT 39, \u00b6 21, 304 Mont. 215, \u00b6 21, 19 P.3d 817, \u00b6 21). As we have held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b185-6\">[T]his Court may discretionarily review claimed errors that implicate a criminal defendant\u2019s fundamental constitutional rights, even if no contemporaneous objection is made and notwithstanding the inapplicability of the \u00a7 46-20-701(2), MCA, criteria, where failing to review the claimed error at issue may result in a manifest miscarriage of justice, may leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the trial or proceedings, or may compromise the integrity of the judicial process.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b185-7\"><em>Finley, </em>276 Mont. at 137, 915 P.2d at 215. Plain error review is rooted in \u201cour inherent power and paramount obligation to interpret Montana\u2019s Constitution and to protect the various rights set forth in that document.\u201d <em>Finley, </em>276 Mont. at 137, 915 P.2d at 215. However, we do not lightly excuse the failure to raise a contemporaneous objection. Rather, we utilize plain error review sparingly, on a case-by-case basis. <em>Finley, </em>276 Mont. at 138, 915 P.2d at 215.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>\u00b619 \u201cThe right to a fair trial is a fundamental liberty secured by the Fourteenth Amendment\u201d to the United States Constitution. <em>Estelle v. Williams </em>(1976), 425 U.S. 501, 503, 96 S.Ct. 1691, 1692, 48 L.Ed.2d 126. \u201cThe presumption of innocence, although not articulated in the Constitution, is a basic component of a fair trial under our system of criminal justice.\u201d <em>Estelle, </em>425 U.S. at 503, 96 S.Ct. at 1692. \u201c[T]he Due Process Clause protects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the crime with which he is charged.\u201d <em>In re Winship </em>(1970), 397 U.S. 358, 364, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 1073, 25 L.Ed.2d 368. Moreover, the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt \u201cplays a vital role in the American scheme of criminal procedure\u201d in that it \u201cprovides concrete substance for the presumption of innocence.\u201d <em>In re Winship, </em>397 U.S. at 363, 90 S.Ct. at 1072.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">\u00b620 In recognition of the foregoing principles, I conclude that the errors alleged by Newman implicate her fundamental constitutional right to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, and Article II, Section 17, of the Montana Constitution. Further, I conclude that these alleged errors, if left unaddressed by this Court, would bring into question the fundamental fairness of Newman\u2019s trial. Accordingly, I conclude that plain error review is appropriate in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">\u00b621 <em>3. Did the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument deprive Newman of a fair trial?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">\u00b622 As noted above, Newman argues that the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument amounted to misconduct which denied her a fair trial and due process by violating her right to be presumed innocent and undermining the State\u2019s burden to prove every element of the charged offenses beyond a reasonable doubt. Newman also argues that she was denied a fair trial when the prosecutor commented on matters not in evidence. In response, the State contends that the prosecutor did not specifically say Newman was responsible for establishing her innocence, and that the jury instructions properly explained the presumption of innocence. The State also argues that the prosecutor\u2019s comments were appropriate because he merely commented on the evidence as a whole, and suggested inferences which could be drawn therefrom. Finally, the State argues that Newman has failed to demonstrate prejudice resulting from the prosecutor\u2019s comments.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-7\">\u00b623 In order to afford a defendant the due process guaranteed under both the United States Constitution and the Montana Constitution, the State must prove every element of a charged offense beyond a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>reasonable doubt. <em>State v. McCaslin, </em>2004 MT 212, \u00b6 24, 322 Mont. 350, \u00b6 24, 96 P.3d 722, \u00b6 24. This burden of proof is closely related to the presumption of innocence, as demonstrated by \u00a7 46-16-204, MCA, which provides that \u201c[a] defendant in a criminal action is presumed to be innocent until the contrary is proved, and in case of a reasonable doubt whether the defendant\u2019s guilt is satisfactorily shown, the defendant must be found not guilty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">\u00b624 Our prior holdings have acknowledged the close relation between these two legal principles, and have consistently recognized the presumption of innocence as an essential component of a criminal prosecution. In <em>State v. Howell </em>(1901), 26 Mont. 3, 5, 66 P. 291, 292, this Court stated that a criminal defendant</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-5\">is always entitled to have the jury take into consideration the presumption of innocence which the law throws about him. . . . This presumption comes to the aid of the defendant at every stage of the case, and is finally rebutted and overturned only by evidence establishing every element of the crime charged to the satisfaction of the jury beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">Similarly, in <em>State v. Martin </em>(1903), 29 Mont. 273, 279, 74 P. 725, 727, this Court said that the presumption of innocence</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-7\">is the safeguard which the law casts around all persons accused of crime, and the defendant cannot be reached by a verdict of guilty until this safeguard is entirely removed. This removal can only be accomplished by evidence which satisfies the minds of the jurors beyond a reasonable doubt. The presumption of innocence is in effect the very thing against which the prosecution is directed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-8\">Again, <em>in State v. Gilbert </em>(1951), 125 Mont. 104, 109, 232 P.2d 338, 341, this Court stated that the \u201cpresumption of innocence surrounds the defendant at every step in the trial and to its benefits he is entitled in the determination of every fact by the jury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-9\">\u00b625 In <em>State v. Williams </em>(1979), 184 Mont. 111, 112, 601 P.2d 1194, 1195, this Court addressed the issue of whether the trial court\u2019s refusal to give the defendant\u2019s requested instruction on the presumption of innocence resulted in a violation of his right to a fair trial as secured by the due process guarantee of the United States Constitution and the Montana Constitution. Acknowledging the presumption of innocence as a foundational element of criminal law, this Court held that \u201ceven though the jury was properly instructed as to the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt, when he so requests, the defendant is still entitled to an instruction as to the presumption of innocence which</p>\n<p id=\"Afs\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>\u00b626 Other opinions from this Court have also acknowledged the paramount importance of the presumption of innocence. In <em>State v. Nicholls </em>(1982), 200 Mont. 144, 150, 649 P.2d 1346, 1349, this Court referred to the presumption of innocence as a \u201cconstitutional protection.\u201d Similarly, in <em>City of Missoula v. Shea </em>(1983), 202 Mont. 286, 294, 661 P.2d 410, 414, this Court referred to the presumption of innocence as a \u201cconstitutional due process requirement.\u201d It is apparent that our case law falls in line with <em>Estelle, </em>wherein the United States Supreme Court stated that although the presumption of innocence is not articulated in the United States Constitution, it is a \u201cbasic component of a fair trial\u201d as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. <em>Estelle, </em>425 U.S. at 503,96 S.Ct. at 1692. While our cases have consistently upheld the presumption of innocence as a fundamental element of Montana\u2019s criminal law, this Court has not adopted the language <em>ofEstelle </em>to explicitly designate the presumption as a component of due process under Montana\u2019s Constitution. Hence, I conclude that the presumption of innocence, although not articulated in the Montana Constitution, is an essential component of a fair trial as secured by the due process guarantee of Article II, Section 17, of the Montana Constitution. exists in his favor.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>184 Mont. at 112, 601 P.2d at 1195. Further, this Court held to the \u201cper se rule that an instruction on the presumption of innocence is required in every case when a timely request has been made.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>184 Mont. at 114, 601 P.2d at 1196.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">\u00b627 I now turn to the merits of Newman\u2019s argument. During the State\u2019s closing, the prosecutor presented the following argument to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-5\">What I think is very interesting is, ask yourself who did we not hear from. The Defendant had every opportunity to present whatever she wanted to present, and who did we not hear from? We did not hear from Amber, her daughter. We did not hear from Mike, her son. We did not hear from Miranda, the other girl who lived there for the last three years. George Garcia, we didn\u2019t hear from George Garcia. Did we hear from Doug in Drummond? Didn\u2019t hear from Doug.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-6\">She said, of course, there was a lot of traffic after Butch died because they were so concerned for me. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-7\">... [W]here are those so concerned friends now to say, I wasn\u2019t buying drugs? We didn\u2019t hear from any of that [sic]. I\u2019d suggest it\u2019s because they\u2019ve flown the coop. The Defendant is not there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>anymore. These aren\u2019t concerned friends. They\u2019re people who she was supplying.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-4\">... The Defendant knew that any one of those people could have been there .... Amber could have been here to say, yeah, I got in trouble for drugs, but, man, my mom never does drugs. They\u2019re not here because they can\u2019t say it. They\u2019re not here because they can\u2019t come in and testify that way and tell the truth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-5\">If we look at all that, I think we have laid out a case for the four crimes that were charged....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b189-6\">Where was Amber to say, Uncle Randy is lying to you when [sic] says we sat around with my Mends and light up whenever mom did. Because that\u2019s what happened. Probably with that red bong sitting in the front room when the detectives showed up.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJZ\">\u00b628 As the presumption of innocence \u201csurrounds the defendant at every step in the trial,\u201d <em>Gilbert, </em>125 Mont. at 109, 232 P.2d at 341, the prosecutor was not at liberty to undermine the presumption during the State\u2019s closing argument. However, the prosecutor used this stage of the proceeding to repeatedly criticize Newman for failing to present witnesses to corroborate her testimony. Additionally, the prosecutor asked the jury to consider this failure in rendering a verdict, stating \u201c[t]hey\u2019re not here because they can\u2019t come in and testify that way and tell the truth. If we look at all that, I think we have laid out a case for the four crimes that were charged.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">\u00b629 These arguments suggested to the jury that guilt could be determined, in part, based on Newman\u2019s failure to call witnesses. This suggestion directly contravened the presumption of innocence. Further, by asserting that Newman\u2019s defense lacked merit for her failure to call witnesses, the prosecutor\u2019s comments suggested that Newman had some obligation to present evidence. This suggestion also directly contravened the presumption of innocence, pursuant to which Newman had absolutely no obligation to prove any facts. Moreover, the prosecutor\u2019s argument improperly shifted the jury\u2019s attention from the State\u2019s substantive evidence to the lack of affirmative evidence presented by Newman. This further undermined the presumption of innocence and diminished the State\u2019s burden of proof in the mind of any juror who took this argument seriously.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">\u00b630 The same portion of the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument which undermined Newman\u2019s constitutional right to the presumption of innocence, was also improper because it contained references to matters not in evidence. We have held that it is improper for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>prosecutor to comment on evidence not of record during closing argument. <em>State v. Gladue, </em>1999 MT 1, \u00b6 14, 293 Mont. 1, \u00b6 14, 972 P.2d 827, \u00b6 14. Here, the prosecutor asserted that some of Newman\u2019s acquaintances and family members with knowledge relevant to the case were not at the trial because they had \u201cflown the coop\u201d or could not testify truthfully. However, there was no evidence regarding the willingness of these individuals to appear at trial, and no evidence regarding their willingness to testify truthfully.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">\u00b631 In <em>Berger v. United States </em>(1935), 295 U.S. 78, 55 S.Ct. 629, 79 L.Ed. 1314, the United States Supreme Court discussed the special responsibility of a prosecutor and the harm potentially resulting from improper prosecutorial efforts. The Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-5\">[W]hile [a prosecutor] may strike hard blows, he is not at liberty to strike foul ones. It is as much his duty to refrain from improper methods calculated to produce a wrongful conviction as it is to use every legitimate means to bring about a just one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-6\">It is fair to say that the average jury, in a greater or less degree, has confidence that these obligations, which so plainly rest upon the prosecuting attorney, will be faithfully observed. Consequently, improper suggestions, insinuations and, especially, assertions of personal knowledge are apt to carry much weight against the accused when they should properly carry none.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9\"><em>Berger, </em>295 U.S. at 88, 55 S.Ct. at 633. Recognizing the special influence a prosecutor has with a jury based on his or her status as a representative of the State, I am reluctant to condone any prosecutorial argument that undermines the presumption of innocence. However, this Court will not presume that a defendant suffers prejudice from improper prosecutorial comments. <em>Gladue, </em>\u00b6 27. Rather, a defendant must demonstrate, based on the record, that the prosecutor\u2019s improper comments prejudiced his or her right to a fair trial. <em>Gladue, </em>\u00b6 27. In determining whether prejudice resulted, the prosecutor\u2019s improper comments must be viewed in the context of the case in its entirety. <em>Gladue, </em>\u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">\u00b632 Here, I conclude that Newman was prejudiced because the prosecutor aggressively suggested that the jury disregard the presumption of innocence, thereby creating a risk that she would be convicted on that basis. The fact that the prosecutor did not explicitly state that Newman was responsible for establishing her innocence does not alleviate the effect of this improper argument. Nor do proper jury instructions cure such an error. I simply can not excuse a prosecutorial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>argument that so forcefully contravenes a fundamental constitutional protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">\u00b633 Accordingly, I conclude that Newman was denied a fair trial because the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument effectively undermined her constitutional right to the presumption of innocence as secured by the due process guarantee of the Montana Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">\u00b634 That being said, I address Justice Warner\u2019s contention that \u201cthe arguments in question were not at all aimed at the presumption of innocence,\u201d but were \u201can attack on Newman\u2019s credibility.\u201d My opinion is based on the prosecutor\u2019s words as they appear in the transcript-the words which were spoken to the jury. The dissent, however, resorts to speculation about the prosecutor\u2019s intent, spinning the closing' argument as a constitutionally harmless swipe at Newman\u2019s credibility. However, even if it were possible to accurately discern a pure motive behind the prosecutor\u2019s comments, I could not hold that it would cure the serious constitutional problem here. Regardless of where the prosecutor \u201caimed\u201d with these comments, they struck at the very heart of a fundamental constitutional protection. No pure motive can serve to remedy such a violation. Thus, I focus on the actual words used.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">\u00b635 I take exception to the dissent\u2019s baseless accusation that I have taken the prosecutor\u2019s comments \u201cout of context.\u201d Perhaps this charge results from my refusal to inject the transcript with speculation regarding the prosecutor\u2019s motives. Of course, I have focused on the entirety of the contested comments in the context in which they were used. Further, I have reviewed the closing arguments in full, and considered them in light of the trial as a whole. Indeed, it is the dissent that supplies the context-by way of speculation-which supports a different conclusion. Moreover, I can not envision a context that would justify the suggestion, as was made by the prosecutor, that a jury may legitimately consider a defendant\u2019s failure to present witnesses as a strike against him or her. This notion is absolutely contrary to the presumption of innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">\u00b636 My consideration of the context leads me to note that the dissent\u2019s position is undermined by the fact that Newman\u2019s counsel recognized the prosecutor\u2019s comments as an attack on the presumption of innocence, and responded accordingly in closing. As the dissent notes, Newman\u2019s counsel restated the prosecutor\u2019s comments and immediately responded by explaining the presumption of innocence. Hence, I am simply recognizing the same impropriety which defense counsel recognized during closing.</p>\n<p id=\"A_T\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>\u00b637 The dissent goes on to suggest that even if the prosecutor\u2019s comments were an attack on the presumption of innocence, defense counsel\u2019s closing argument, together with the jury instructions regarding the State\u2019s burden of proof, would provide a sufficient remedial effect. I can not agree. To take such a position would allow juries to be subjected to conflicting messages regarding the presumption of innocence. This, in turn, would force defendants to beg the jury to rely on the instructions rather than the prosecutor\u2019s arguments. Of course, defendants should not have to struggle for the right to be presumed innocent. That fight was waged, and won, long ago. <em>Estelle, </em>425 U.S. at 503, 96 S.Ct. at 1692. As this Court has said, the presumption of innocence \u201cis in effect the very thing against which the prosecution is directed.\u201d <em>Martin, </em>29 Mont. at 279, 74 P. at 727. Thus, a prosecutor must overcome the presumption by presenting persuasive evidence and arguments; not by suggesting that the defendant has some obligation to justify the presumption.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">\u00b638 Moreover, to the extent that the closing argument can be construed as an attack on Newman\u2019s credibility, its status as such can not render it constitutionally valid. In other words, an attack on the presumption of innocence is not rendered acceptable just because it is also an attack on the defendant\u2019s credibility. It was the prosecutor\u2019s job to tailor any attacks on Newman\u2019s credibility so as not to undermine any of her fundamental constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">\u00b639 The dissent also cites this Court\u2019s previous holding that it is proper for the prosecution to comment on conflicts and contradictions in testimony, as well as to comment on the evidence presented and suggest to the jury inferences which may be drawn therefrom. <em>Gladue, </em>\u00b6 15. However, the prosecutor\u2019s suggestion that someone not present at trial might say something in contradiction to Newman\u2019s testimony simply does not qualify as a comment on conflicts or contradictions in testimony. Nor was this suggestion a comment on the evidence presented. Rather, it was a comment on evidence <em>not </em>presented at trial. As such, I do not find this precedent applicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-6\">\u00b640 Finally, I share the dissent\u2019s concern with limiting the use of plain error review. However, this Court must be mindful to employ a similar level of concern in evaluating alleged constitutional violations.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">\u00b641 Justice Rice\u2019s dissent maintains that the prosecutor\u2019s argument was merely a comment regarding other individuals\u2019 failure to testify. Consequently, the dissent finds the prosecutor\u2019s comments acceptable under <em>State v. Rodarte, </em>2002 MT 317, 313 Mont. 131, 60 P.3d 983, wherein we stated that \u201cthe prosecution is permitted to point out facts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>at issue which could have been controverted by persons other than the defendant, but were not.\u201d <em>Rodarte, </em>\u00b6 14. The short portion of the prosecutor\u2019s argument which the dissent quotes could arguably be considered acceptable under <em>Rodarte </em>if viewed in isolation. However, I find <em>Rodarte </em>irrelevant when viewing the prosecutor\u2019s arguments in their entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-4\">\u00b642 The dissent\u2019s analysis ignores pertinent parts of the trial transcript. First, it ignores the fact that the prosecutor repeatedly criticized Newman personally for failing to call witnesses to corroborate her testimony. The prosecutor argued Newman \u201cknew that any one of those people could have been there,\u201d that she \u201chad every opportunity to present whatever she wanted,\u201d and that she nonetheless failed to present numerous witnesses who could have corroborated her testimony. Second, the dissent\u2019s analysis ignores the fact that the prosecutor then proceeded to ask the jury to consider Newman\u2019s failure to call such witnesses in rendering a verdict, stating \u201c[i]f we look at all that, I think we have laid out a case for the four crimes that were charged.\u201d These arguments placed unwarranted blame squarely on Newman for failing to present witnesses. Thus, I can not agree that this was merely an attack on Newman\u2019s testimony or an attack upon \u201cthe failure of persons to testify who could have controverted the State\u2019s evidence,\u201d as the dissent asserts.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">\u00b643 The holding of <em>Rodarte </em>can only be decisive in this case if we ignore significant portions of the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument, and I will not do so. Nor would I expand <em>Rodarte </em>so as to condone the prosecutorial argument at issue here. The <em>Rodarte </em>rule, by its plain terms, simply does not give prosecutors license to suggest to a jury that a defendant has some duty to call witnesses to corroborate his or her testimony. Nor can <em>Rodarte </em>be construed as a rule allowing prosecutors to ask a jury to consider such a failure as evidence adverse to a defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">\u00b644 As part of its analysis, the dissent asserts that Newman \u201chad <em>not </em>relied upon her presumption of innocence-she had instead affirmatively offered an alternate explanation of the State\u2019s evidence.\u201d I must respond to this statement because the dissent proffers it in a way which suggests that a defendant\u2019s decision to testify has some bearing on the protection provided by the presumption of innocence. Particularly, it suggests that the presumption of innocence somehow had less force here because Newman did not \u201crely\u201d upon it. Further, it suggests that Newman had to choose between maintaining the full <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>benefit of the presumption on one hand, and testifying in her own defense on the other hand.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">\u00b645 Of course, we can only speculate as to whether Newman \u201crelied\u201d on the presumption of innocence. But even if she and her counsel completely disregarded the presumption, its constraints upon the prosecution were not thereby rendered any less stringent. While the dissent attaches some significance to Newman\u2019s decision to testify, it cites no authority for the notion that this fact should have some bearing on the analysis regarding the presumption of innocence. I reject this notion, as it is well established that the presumption is overcome only by proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every element of a charged offense. Section 46-16-204, MCA; <em>Howell, </em>26 Mont. at 5, 66 P. at 292; <em>Martin, </em>29 Mont. at 279, 74 P. at 727. Thus, there is nothing inconsistent in clinging steadfastly to the presumption of innocence while also testifying in one\u2019s own defense. To reason otherwise would be to create new legal prec\u00e9dent repugnant to the presumption of innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">\u00b646 Finally, the dissent claims that defense counsel's failure to object to the prosecutor\u2019s argument was a \u201cchoice to take the issue from the judge for his own purposes.\u201d Any knowledge the dissent may possess regarding defense counsel's thought process at trial is based on pure speculation and is not properly considered by this Court, as the record before us discloses nothing in this regard. Moreover, even if it were possible to accurately divine defense counsel\u2019s motives, the dissent cites no authority for the proposition that such an improper intent should impact the analysis regarding the presumption of innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">\u00b647 In conclusion, I note that Newman claims her trial counsel provided ineffective assistance when he failed to object to the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument and failed to offer an accomplice jury instruction. Having already discussed the dispositive issue, I will not address these arguments. Counsel can request a proper accomplice instruction in the new trial or refrain from doing so after consulting with Newman.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">\u00b648 Having concluded that the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument deprived Newman of a fair trial, I concur in our decision to reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b194-9\">JUSTICE COTTER joins in the special concurrence of JUSTICE NELSON.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b194-11\">JUSTICE LEAPHART</author>\n<p id=\"A6ST\">specially concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>\u00b649 I would reverse the conviction due to defense counsel\u2019s ineffective assistance in failing to request an accomplice jury instruction pursuant to \u00a7 26-1-303(4), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">\u00b650 Section 26-1-303(4), MCA, requires that, when proper, the court must instruct the jury that \u201cthe testimony of a person legally accountable for the acts of the accused ought to be viewed with distrust.\u201d The State argues that this provision does not apply to Newman\u2019s case because Jordan did not act as an accomplice. Section 45-2-302(3), MCA, states that \u201c[a] person is legally accountable for the conduct of another when either before or during the commission of an offense with the purpose to promote or facilitate such commission, he solicits, aids, abets, agrees, or attempts to aid such other person in the planning or commission of the offense.\u201d In addition, this Court defines \u201c[a] true accomplice [as] one who knowingly, voluntarily and with common intent with the principal offender unites in the commission of a crime .... One may become an accomplice by being present and joining in the criminal act, by aiding and abetting another in its commission.\u201d <em>State v. Nordahl </em>(1984), 208 Mont. 513, 517, 679 P.2d 241, 243 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">\u00b651 Jordan lived with Newman and testified to selling drugs on her behalf. Initially, Jordan even claimed all the drugs belonged to him; a story he did not change until cutting a deal with the State to testify against Newman in exchange for a suspended sentence. In knowingly selling drugs on Newman\u2019s behalf, Jordan satisfies the statutory definition of \u201ca person legally accountable\u201d and this Court\u2019s definition of an \u201caccomplice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">\u00b652 Newman argues that she received ineffective assistance because her counsel failed to request an accomplice jury instruction. \u201cA criminal defendant is denied effective assistance of counsel if: (1) his counsel\u2019s conduct falls short of the range reasonably demanded in light of the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution; and (2) counsel\u2019s failure is prejudicial.\u201d <em>State v. Rose, </em>1998 MT 342, \u00b6 12, 292 Mont. 350, \u00b6 12, 972 P.2d 321, \u00b6 12 (citations omitted). <em>See also Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. The <em>Strickland </em>test \u201crequires the defendant to establish prejudice by demonstrating that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome, but it does not require that a defendant demonstrate that he would have been acquitted.\u201d <em>State v. Kougl, </em>2004 MT 243, \u00b6 25, 323 Mont. 6, \u00b6 25, 97 P.3d 1095, \u00b6 25 (quotations and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"AkG\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>\u00b653 Before examining an ineffective assistance of counsel claim on direct appeal, we generally look to the record to see whether we can answer \u201cwhy\u2019 counsel did or did not perform as alleged. <em>Kougl, </em>\u00b6 14. If we can answer \u201cwhy,\u201d we will address the issue on appeal. If the claim is based on matters outside the record, we will refuse to address the issue on appeal and allow the defendant to file a postconviction proceeding. <em>Kougl, </em>\u00b6 14; <em>State v. Grixti, </em>2005 MT 296, \u00b6 27, 329 Mont. 330, \u00b6 27, 124 P.3d 177, \u00b6 27. \u201cSometimes, however, it is unnecessary to ask \u2018why in the first instance\u201d-for example, \u201cwhen counsel is faced with an obligatory, and therefore non-tactical, action.\u201d <em>Kougl, </em>\u00b6 15. In such a case, \u201cthe question is not \u2018why but \u2018whether\u2019 counsel acted.\u201d <em>Kougl, </em>\u00b6 15. In my view, the circumstances of Newman\u2019s trial qualify as such a case. The prosecution primarily relied on testimony from Newman\u2019s brother, Randy Jordan, at trial. Initially, the State charged Jordan with criminal possession of dangerous drugs after police searched Newman\u2019s home and Jordan claimed ownership of all of the drugs uncovered. Before the trial, however, Jordan, looking at thirty years in prison, agreed to testify against Newman in exchange for thirty years of probation. Pursuant to this agreement, J ordan testified that the marijuana in Newman\u2019s house belonged to Newman, that she sold marijuana frequently, and that he too sold drugs on her behalf. A review of the trial record provides no explanation as to why defense counsel did not ask for an accomplice jury instruction with regard to Jordan\u2019s testimony. Given the importance of Jordan\u2019s testimony to the State\u2019s case, and the significant benefit he received by testifying against his sister, the more appropriate question is <em>whether </em>counsel acted. In light of Jordan\u2019s alleged complicity in Newman\u2019s conduct, defense counsel had an obligation to request the instruction that the jury view Jordan\u2019s accomplice testimony with suspicion.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">\u00b654 If, for tactical reasons, counsel believes such an instruction would be inappropriate, counsel should make a record of that position.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In the absence of a strategic reason being apparent on the record or a statement on the record from defense counsel specifically declining such an instruction, the language of \u00a7 26-1-303(4), MCA, requires that when a witness purports to have been an accomplice of the accused, effective defense counsel must request an accomplice instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>\u00b655 In <em>Kougl </em>we faced the same issue presented here-that is, whether defense counsel\u2019s failure to ask that the jury be instructed to view an accomplice\u2019s testimony with suspicion constituted ineffective assistance of counsel. We held that since the State\u2019s case against the defendant was largely based on the credibility of three accomplices, \u201ctrial counsel failed to use the law to strike at the heart of the State\u2019s case\u201d by not requesting the accomplice jury instruction. <em>Kougl, </em>\u00b6 20. In light of this failure, Kougl experienced prejudice \u201cbecause the instructions would have conveyed to the jurors that the law commanded them to view the State\u2019s crucial evidence with distrust such that there is a reasonable probability they would have arrived at a different outcome.\u201d <em>Kougl, </em>\u00b6 26. We concluded that \u201ctrial counsel could have no plausible explanation for not asking for instructions on accomplice testimony,\u201d and therefore her performance was deficient, satisfying the first prong of the <em>Strickland </em>test. <em>Kougl, </em>\u00b6 24. In addition, we noted that Kougl\u2019s trial counsel further failed him by not requesting an instruction that such testimony must be corroborated pursuant to \u00a7 46-16-213, MCA. \u201cThe corroborating evidence need not be robust in such a situation, but it must raise more than a suspicion of the defendant\u2019s involvement in, or opportunity to commit, the crime charged.\u201d <em>Kougl, </em>\u00b6 21 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">\u00b656 It should be noted that in <em>Kougl </em>we distinguished <em>State v. Johnson </em>(1993), 257 Mont. 157, 848 P.2d 496, 499, a case involving the same issue: whether counsel incorrectly failed to request a jury instruction providing that accomplice testimony must be viewed with distrust. We determined in <em>Kougl </em>that because \u201cJohnson claimed that he was not at the scene of the crime, ... asking the jury to view his accuser as an \u2018accomplice\u2019 would contradict this defense\u201d; thus we held that a record-based justification existed for why Johnson\u2019s counsel did not ask for an instruction on accomplice testimony, whereas no such record-based justification existed in <em>Kougl. Kougl, </em>\u00b6 18 (citing <em>Johnson, </em>257 Mont. at 163, 848 P.2d at 499). I think we need to clarify the <em>Johnson </em>rationale. To hold that an accomplice instruction is inappropriate when a defendant maintains his innocence is illogical. Because instructions only come into play at trial and no trial occurs unless the defendant maintains his innocence, under the <em>Johnson </em>rationale, an accomplice instruction would never be strategically appropriate, as it would always contradict the assertion of innocence. The unwritten assumption in <em>Johnson </em>is that a defendant who requests an accomplice instruction admits to having committed a criminal act in concert with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>the <em>accomplice</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>In my view, however, requesting an accomplice instruction in fact supports a defendant\u2019s position of innocence by directing the jury to view with distrust the accusations of a witness who purports to have acted in concert. I would therefore qualify the <em>Johnson </em>rationale and require, pursuant to \u00a7 26-1-303(4), MCA, that when a witness purports to have been an accomplice, defense counsel must request an accomplice instruction or state on the record that, for tactical reasons, the defendant does not want the instruction given; in the words of \u00a7 26-1-303, MCA, counsel must make a record that, given the testimony, the case at hand is not a \u201cproper occasion\u201d for such an instruction. <em>State v. Hall, </em>2003 MT 253, \u00b6 30, 317 Mont. 356, \u00b6 30, 77 P.3d 239, \u00b6 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">\u00b657 With regard to this case, Jordan\u2019s testimony that he helped Newman sell drugs qualified him as a person \u201clegally accountable for the acts of the accused.\u201d Section 26-1-303(4), MCA. Given the importance of Jordan\u2019s testimony in convicting Newman, trial counsel had an obligation to request an accomplice instruction directing the jury to view Jordan\u2019s testimony with distrust. If the jury had received such an instruction, as well as been directed to find corroborating evidence for Jordan\u2019s testimony, there is a reasonable probability it would have returned a not guilty verdict. In accord with our decision in <em>Kougl, </em>I can discern no tactical advantage to the trial counsel\u2019s failure to request the appropriate accountability jury instructions. \u00b658 I would reverse the conviction and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<judges id=\"b198-5\">JUSTICE MORRIS joins the specially concurrence of JUSTICE LEAPHART.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b196-5\"> Although defense counsel is not normally required to make a record of why he or she is not requesting a jury instruction, such a procedure is logical when a particular instruction, aimed at protecting the defendant, is statutorily required in \u201cappropriate\u201d circumstances.

Rodarte, </em>2002 MT 317, 313 Mont. 131, 60 P.3d 983, we addressed the permissible scope of a prosecutor\u2019s closing argument and held: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number><em>Rodarte, </em>\u00b6 14. Here, notwithstanding defense counsel\u2019s perception, the prosecutor did not comment on the <em>Defendants </em>failure to testify, but rather the failure of \u201cpersons other than the defendant\u201d to testify.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b198-9\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>While it is improper for the prosecution to comment on the failure of a defendant to testify on his own behalf, the prosecution is permitted to point out facts at issue which could have been controverted by persons other than the defendant, but were not.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>\u00b661 This distinction is further understood when the context of the prosecutor\u2019s comments is considered. The prosecutor had offered evidence of the traffic to and from Defendant\u2019s home in support of the drug distribution charges. To defeat this evidence, the Defendant testified that these frequent visits were made by well-wishers who were giving her support in her time of bereavement. Thus, the Defendant had <em>not </em>relied upon her presumption of innocence-she had instead affirmatively offered an alternate explanation of the State\u2019s evidence. It was this proffered defense which the prosecutor commented upon, including the failure of those in Defendant\u2019s household to controvert the State\u2019s facts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-5\">We did not hear from Amber, her daughter. We did not hear from Mike, her son. We did not hear from Miranda, the other girl who lived there for the last three years. George Garcia, we didn\u2019t hear from George Garcia. Did we hear from Doug in Drummond? Didn\u2019t hear from Doug. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Thus, arguably, the prosecutor\u2019s attack was not made upon Defendant\u2019s presumption of innocence, but upon the defense and testimony which the Defendant had affirmatively offered, and the failure of persons to testify who could have controverted the State\u2019s evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"AEO\">\u00b662 These circumstances illustrate the impropriety of exercising plain error review in this case. Defense counsel elected not to object to the prosecutor\u2019s closing for a reason: so he could use the prosecutor\u2019s comments against the State during his own closing argument. Thus, he sat quiet during the prosecutor\u2019s closing, when an objection would have immediately brought the matter to the judge\u2019s attention, and instead sought to discredit the State\u2019s case by raising the issue in closing. If it would have worked, and the jury had acquitted, this case would not be before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-8\">\u00b663 However, it failed, and now Defendant wants to have her cake and eat it too. This Court should not countenance such manipulations and abuse of the legal system. The trial judge could well have addressed the problem at the time, but it was defense counsel\u2019s choice to take the issue from the judge for his own purposes. When a defendant participates in trial error, he cannot then challenge the error on appeal. \u201cWe will not put a district court in error for an action in which the appealing party acquiesced or actively participated.\u201d <em>State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number><em>Harris, </em>1999 MT 115, \u00b6 32, 294 Mont. 397, \u00b6 32, 983 P.2d 881, \u00b6 32 (citing <em>State v.

However, I believe this case illustrates well why the <em>Johnson </em>rule should be retained, and that there is clear reason why the statute does not require the instruction to be given in all such cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">\u00b668 First, Newman and Jordan were not charged with the same offenses at the time of trial. The concurring opinion points to Jordan\u2019s testimony that he helped Newman sell drugs in an effort to link Jordan to the charges against Newman for criminal distribution of dangerous drugs and possession of drugs with intent to distribute. However, Jordan was charged with theft, drug possession, possession of drug paraphernalia and aggravated burglary, none of which involved distribution of or the intent to distribute drugs. Thus, the parties were not accomplices by virtue of the respective charges filed against them.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">\u00b669 Second, and more critically, is the evidence. The sum total of Jordan\u2019s testimony upon which Newman and the concurring opinion rely for the proposition that Jordan \u201chelped Newman sell drugs,\u201d \u00b6 57, consists of the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-7\">Defense Counsel: And were you selling drugs?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-8\">Jordan: No, not really, I don\u2019t think. Maybe once or twice for her.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A9z\">\u00b670 This brief, ambiguous comment is insufficient to support an assertion that Jordan is \u201clegally accountable for the acts of the accused.\u201d Section 26-1-303(4), MCA. Contrary to Newman\u2019s characterization, Jordan testified that he did <em>not </em>sell any drugs, or, at best, that \u201cmaybe\u201d he had, but was not sure. How different this case is from <em>Kougl, </em>where we noted that \u201c[t]he parties are agreed that Loney, Pool, and Fassler were accomplices\u201d with Kougl, <em>Kougl, </em>\u00b6 20, and, indeed, the evidence overwhelmingly supported that conclusion. <em>Kougl, </em>\u00b6 8. \u201c[A] criminal defendant is entitled to jury instructions that cover every issue or theory having support in the evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Beavers, </em>1999 MT 260, \u00b6 23,296 Mont. 340, \u00b6 23,987 P.2d 371, \u00b6 23. Obviously, the converse is not true: a defendant cannot be forced to bear an instruction which is not supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>\u00b671 Thirdly, there is a legitimate, strategic component to the giving, and thus, the requesting, of this instruction. Here, an accomplice instruction would appear to have been completely inconsistent with Newman\u2019s defense. She testified, and her theory was, that the drugs and paraphernalia seized in the house were not hers, and that Jordan\u2019s testimony about her sale of drugs was false:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-4\">Defense Counsel: ... So it\u2019s your testimony that none of this drug paraphernalia is yours; is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-5\">Newman: That is correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-6\">Defense Counsel: What about the drugs themselves?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-7\">Newman: No, sir, they are not mine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-8\">Defense Counsel: Were you using those drugs or selling those drugs, or did you participate with other people in selling those drugs for money?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-9\">Newman: No, I have never sold drugs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-10\">Defense Counsel: Now, you\u2019ve heard Randy [Jordan]\u2019s testimony that he said he saw you sell drugs to the people coming into the house or that you would drive somewhere to locations and sell drugs; you\u2019ve heard that testimony?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-11\">Newman: Yes, I have.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-12\">Defense Counsel: Is that true?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-13\">Newman: No, it is not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-14\">Defense Counsel: Did you ever go with [Jordan] anywhere to sell drugs or -</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AsM\">Newman: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b202-15\">\u00b672 Given this testimony and Newman\u2019s theory, it would have been supreme incongruence for Newman to ask that the jury be instructed to view Jordan\u2019s testimony with distrust for being legally accountable for acts which Newman adamantly claimed never occurred. Unlike the record in <em>Kougl, </em>the evidence here presented a legitimate strategic reason for declining to request the instruction. Alternatively, Newman\u2019s trial counsel could have requested the accomplice instruction for purposes of attacking Jordan\u2019s testimony. However, that decision would have required taking a risk-that the jury would recognize the incongruence between Newman\u2019s argument that Jordan was an accomplice and her theory that the acts had not occurred. \u201c[I]t is not proper to give an accountability instruction [based upon \u00a7 26-1-303(4), MCA] where it is not supported by the evidence <em>and is inconsistent with the defendant\u2019s claim of innocence.\u201d State v. Hall, </em>2003 MT 253, \u00b6 30, 317 Mont. 356, \u00b6 30, 77 P.3d 239, \u00b6 30 (emphasis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>added). On matters of strategy, we cannot second-guess counsel. \u201c[W]e will not find ineffective assistance of counsel ... in counsel\u2019s tactical decisions.\u201d <em>Weaver v. State, </em>2005 MT 158, \u00b6 25, 327 Mont. 441, \u00b6 25, 114 P.3d 1039, \u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">\u00b673 The concurring opinion\u2019s statement that \u201c[t]o hold that an accomplice instruction is inappropriate when a defendant maintains his innocence is illogical\u201d (\u00b6 56) may be correct when viewed in isolation. However, the statement does not fully circumscribe the law. Under the statute and our cases, the accomplice instruction is inappropriate when it is inconsistent with the particular theory or evidence a defendant presents in support of his claim of innocence. In those cases, requesting the instruction becomes a tactical matter. In <em>Kougl, </em>the case as presented left no room for a tactical decision, and the instruction was appropriate. Here, the opposite was true.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">\u00b674 I would affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-5\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b203-6\">JUSTICE WARNER</author>\n<p id=\"AYH\">dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-7\">\u00b675 I respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s decision to remand this case for a new trial. I agree with the dissent of Justice Rice concerning Justice Leaphart\u2019s concurring opinion commencing at \u00b6 65. Relating to Justice Nelson\u2019s opinion, in my view it takes the prosecutor\u2019s closing argument out of context, and then goes on to erroneously undertake a plain error review of the case to reach its conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">\u00b676 In considering the appropriateness of plain error review, the Court ignores the principle that we do not lightly excuse the failure to raise a contemporaneous objection but utilize plain error review sparingly. <em>Finley, </em>276 Mont. at 138, 915 P.2d at 215. The Court justifies its use of plain error review by stating that a failure to address the alleged improper closing argument by the prosecution would bring into question the fundamental fairness of Newman\u2019s trial. While this Court has held that utilizing plain error review is proper when a failure to review the claimed error \u201cmay leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the trial,\u201d <em>Finley, </em>276 Mont. at 137, 915 P.2d at 215,1 cannot agree that the trial in the present case was fundamentally unfair.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-9\">\u00b677 While the prosecution\u2019s comments could have been more artfully phrased, the transcript shows the arguments in question were not at all aimed at the presumption of innocence. They were an attack on Newman\u2019s credibility. Newman testified at the trial. Thus, the prosecution could properly comment on her credibility. We have previously found it proper for the prosecution \u201cto comment on conflicts and contradictions in testimony, as well as to comment on the evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>presented and suggest to the jury inferences which may be drawn therefrom.\u201d <em>State v. Daniels, </em>2003 MT 247, \u00b6 26, 317 Mont. 331, \u00b6 26, 77 P.3d 224, \u00b6 26 (quoting <em>State v. Gladue, </em>1999 MT 1, \u00b6\u00b6 14-15, 293 Mont. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 14-15, 972 P.2d 827, \u00b6\u00b6 14-15). The prosecution\u2019s argument was that Newman\u2019s version of events was not credible, and Newman\u2019s failure to call certain witnesses implied that her version of events was not credible. As such, when taken in context, the prosecution\u2019s closing was not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">\u00b678 Even assuming, <em>arguendo, </em>that the prosecution\u2019s closing was an attack on the presumption of innocence, which it was not, Newman has failed to establish any resulting prejudice. This Court has previously held that the burden is on the defendant to demonstrate, from the record, that improper comments by the prosecution prejudiced the defendant\u2019s right to a fair and impartial trial. <em>Gladue, </em>\u00b6 27. In the present case, while Newman\u2019s counsel failed to object to the prosecution\u2019s closing, he clearly pointed out to the jury that Newman was presumed innocent and had no obligation to present any witnesses. He argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b204-5\">Mr. Fulbright [the prosecutor] brought up where are the other witnesses, where is Amber, where are these people that come to the house if they were supporting them. If you remember one thing about the Rices, they both testified that they never saw anyone using drugs at the house and they never saw any drug deals going on in the house. And as Mr. Fulbright indicated, it sounds as if they\u2019re watching this house pretty closely. I mean, they\u2019re taking down notes, they\u2019re writing down license plate numbers to investigate these people. And Mr. Fulbright says, well, where are these people now? Well, it is not the Defendant\u2019s burden. It\u2019s not our burden to prove that my client is innocent. It\u2019s the State\u2019s burden to produce those types of witnesses that may implement [sic] my client in a crime. It\u2019s the government\u2019s burden to prove each and every element beyond a reasonable doubt. That\u2019s the most important principal [sic] of our constitution. And that Sandra is innocent until proven guilty and you all assured me you will do that. And I believe you still will.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b204-6\">\u00b679 This argument by Newman\u2019s counsel, as well as the jury instructions that clearly state it is the State\u2019s burden to prove each element of the alleged offense beyond a reasonable doubt, make it clear that Newman received a fair trial. Considering the entire record, Newman\u2019s fundamental constitutional rights are not implicated in this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>case, the fundamental fairness of the trial is not called into question, and the integrity of the judicial process is not compromised.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">\u00b680 As the prosecution\u2019s closing argument, taken in context, was not improper, and the record reflects that Newman was not prejudiced by such argument, the Court should not undertake plain error review. I would affirm the conviction and dissent from our refusal to do so.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-6\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b205-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY,</author>\n<p id=\"AFk\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-6\">\u00b681 I respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s decision to reverse and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-7\">\u00b682 With regard to Justice Nelson\u2019s opinion, it is my view the various opinions in this case illustrate that whether prosecutorial misconduct actually occurred during closing argument is a close question. Having read the entire transcript, it is clear to me that the case boiled down to a question of whether the jury believed Randy Jordan or whether it believed Sandra Jordan Newman, his sister and the defendant in this case. Indeed, that was the thrust of defense counsel\u2019s opening statement and his closing argument. And without a doubt, Jordan\u2019s credibility was brought into clear focus by both the State and defense counsel. The same was true of defendant Newman. Both the State and the defense presented other witnesses in their cases-in-chief, but Jordan and Newman were the \u201cbattleground\u201d in this case. His-the State\u2019s-theory was that Newman was responsible for the drugs and paraphernalia; her theory was that either Jordan and/or her daughter Amber, who was in a group home at the time of trial because of her drug activities, was responsible. In this \u201cbig picture\u201d context, it is reasonable to argue that the prosecution merely commented on gaps in the defense case by briefly referring to witnesses who did not appear. It also is reasonable to argue that the prosecution\u2019s references touched on the presumption of innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-8\">\u00b683 Even assuming, however, that prosecutorial misconduct occurred, my review of the record convinces me that it was minor in the context of the overall case and does not rise to the level of reviewable plain error. The trial in this matter lasted over one and one-half days, 18 witnesses were called and recalled, and scores of State exhibits were admitted into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-9\">\u00b684 Closing arguments-by the State and defense counsel-cover a mere 37 pages of a transcript containing over 475 pages. In its first closing argument, the prosecution\u2019s references to witnesses not called covers, at most, 23 lines of an 18-page argument. Experienced defense counsel's closing focused primarily on credibility-as had his opening statement-and pointed the finger at Jordan and/or Amber as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>responsible parties. From a 15-page closing argument, one can extract, at most, 33 lines of argument relating to the State\u2019s \u201cwhere are they?\u201d references, primarily hammering on the State\u2019s burden to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. The prosecution did not refer to these matters again in its final closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">\u00b685 Appellate counsel understandably-in the absence of any objection by trial counsel to the remarks by the prosecution-requests plain error review pursuant to <em>Finley, </em>our seminal case on that subject, and <em>State v. Sullivan </em>(1996), 280 Mont. 25, 927 P.2d 1033. We have stated on numerous occasions that such review should be exercised only sparingly. <em>See, e.g., State v. Gray, </em>2004 MT 347, \u00b6 13, 324 Mont. 334, \u00b6 13, 102 P.3d 1255, \u00b6 13; <em>State v. Godfrey, </em>2004 MT 197, \u00b6 22, 322 Mont. 254, \u00b6 22, 95 P.3d 166, \u00b6 22; <em>State v. Rinkenbach, </em>2003 MT 348, \u00b6 13, 318 Mont. 499, \u00b6 13, 82 P.3d 8, \u00b6 13; <em>State v. Daniels, </em>2003 MT 247, \u00b6 20, 317 Mont. 331, \u00b6 20, 77 P.3d 224, \u00b6 20. Indeed, the <em>Finley </em>test for plain error review is that such review should be exercised when failing to do so \u201cmay result in a manifest miscarriage of justice, may leave unsettled the question of the fundamental fairness of the trial or proceedings, or may compromise the integrity of the judicial process.\u201d <em>Finley, </em>276 Mont. at 137, 915 P.2d at 215. On the record before us, and in light of appellate counsel\u2019s candid observation that \u201cpoints made during closing of counsel may be missed or quickly forgotten[,]\u201d I simply am not persuaded that plain error review is warranted here because I am not convinced Newman\u2019s constitutional rights were violated and, if they were, I do not believe any violation impacted on the fundamental fairness of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-5\">\u00b686 I also am not persuaded that <em>Sullivan </em>advances Newman\u2019s cause. <em>Sullivan </em>is a classic case of prosecutorial comment on a defendant\u2019s post <em>-Miranda </em>silence in which we applied plain error review on appeal. There, the prosecutor commented on the defendant\u2019s post <em>-Miranda </em>silence in his opening statement, during his case-in-chief and during his closing argument, all without objection from defense counsel. <em>See Sullivan, </em>280 Mont. at 29-31, 927 P.2d at 1036. Here, Newman voluntarily spoke with law enforcement during the search of her home, voluntarily took the stand in her own defense and called other witnesses on her behalf. The <em>Sullivan </em>\u201csilence\u201d case has no application or relevance here. I would decline to apply plain error review and affirm the District Court on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">\u00b687 I also join in Justice Rice\u2019s dissent from Justice Leaphart\u2019s opinion determining that ineffective assistance of counsel occurred regarding the accomplice instruction and reversing and remanding for a new <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"185\">*185</page-number>trial. In my view, Justice Leaphart\u2019s legal analysis is flawed, as Justice Rice\u2019s dissent makes clear. Further, nothing in \u00a7 26-1-303(4), MCA, even suggests that criminal defense counsel must make a record regarding why a jury instruction is <em>not </em>required. The burden which would be placed on criminal defense counsel should the Court itself start such micro-management of their trial strategies and performance is, to say the very least, unwarranted. Finally, I would conclude that Newman\u2019s other claim of ineffective assistance-namely, the lack of objection to the prosecutor\u2019s comments in closing argument-be pursued, if at all, via a postconviction relief proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">\u00b688 I dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
