The state was not represented.</p>\n<p id=\"AM_Ma\">Before hearing the application, the defendant was advised that the Sentence Review Division has the authority not only to reduce the sentence or affirm it, but also increase it. The defendant was further advised that there is no appeal from a decision of the Sentence Review Division. The defendant acknowledged that he understood this and stated that he wished to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"A13V\">The Division finds that the reasons advanced for modification are sufficient to hold that the sentence imposed by the District Court is clearly excessive in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>light of the circumstances of the offense and the probation officer\u2019s recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"AaJIy\">Therefore, it is the unanimous decision of the Sentence Review Division that the sentence shall be amended to Ten (10) years in the Montana State Prison, with credit for jail and prison time served, with the conditions to remain as imposed in the February 3, 2004 Judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"AgtK\">Done in open Court this 14th day of November, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"AXtC\">DATED this 22nd day of November, 2005.</p>\n<judges id=\"A25E\">Chairperson, Hon.
