The defendant acknowledged that she understood this and stated that she wished to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"ACx\">Rule 17 of the Rules of the Sentence Review Division of the Supreme Court of Montana provides that \u201cthe sentence imposed by the District Court is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>presumed correct, and the sentence will not be reduced or increased unless it is deemed clearly inadequate or excessive.\u201d (\u00a746-18-904(3), MCA).</p>\n<p id=\"ATyO\">The Division finds that the reasons advanced for modification are insufficient to hold that the sentence imposed by the District Court is inadequate or excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"AfcB\">Therefore, it is the unanimous decision of the Sentence Review Division that the sentence shall be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"AQkd\">Done in open Court this 1st day of April, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"AXR\">DATED this 13th day of April, 2005.</p>\n<judges id=\"ABb\">Chairperson, Hon.
