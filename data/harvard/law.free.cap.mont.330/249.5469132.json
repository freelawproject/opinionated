The convictions are to ran concurrently. McKee appeals from the court\u2019s judgment. We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b272-13\">\u00b62 We restate the issues as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b272-14\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err when it denied McKee\u2019s motion to dismiss the information?</p>\n<p id=\"b272-15\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err when it denied McKee\u2019s motion to suppress admissions he made prior to the time law enforcement contacted his parents?</p>\n<p id=\"b272-16\">\u00b65 3. Did the District Court err when it denied McKee\u2019s motion to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>suppress his admission made at the scene of the investigatory stop?</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b273-5\">\u00b66 On the evening of February 4,2004, officers responded to a report that a female bicyclist had been hit in the head by a blunt object as she rode home on River Road in Missoula, Montana. The victim explained that she had been riding her bicycle home from work when a car approached from behind and the passenger in the front seat struck her head with what she described as a shovel or a bat, knocking her to the ground. The victim, who was wearing a helmet, suffered a concussion. The victim told the police that she did not see who did it, but knew the assailants were in a blue car.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-6\">\u00b67 Shortly thereafter, law enforcement received a report of a male bicyclist who had been riding in an alley north of Eighth Street when a blue car pulled up slowly behind him. He felt a blunt object, which he believed might be a bat, narrowly miss striking him, just grazing the hat on his head. The victim saw the person who struck him hanging out the passenger car window. The victim also reported that had the bat not narrowly missed hitting him, he could have been seriously injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-7\">\u00b68 A third victim called the police that same day, reporting that he had been threatened by two juveniles at the Holiday Store at Russell and Third Streets. He reported that two males had asked him to buy them beer, to which he responded in the negative. The man went inside to tell the store staff, and as he exited, the two juveniles were sitting in a blue car; the passenger told him, \u201cYou\u2019re a dead man.\u201d A few minutes later the youths came up behind the man in their vehicle and the passenger swung a bat at him several times. The victim had to repeatedly dodge the bat to keep from getting hit.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-8\">\u00b69 Officer Ken Guy responded to the area and located a vehicle matching the description, with two males inside. Noting an inoperative rear tail light, Officer Guy turned his patrol car around to stop the car, at which point the vehicle sped off. Officer Guy followed the car for several blocks and because of snow tracks was able to locate where it had been driven into an alley, over a curb, and into a yard. Officer Guy arrived just as two males exited a blue Ford Tempo; he ordered the juveniles to stop and stand facing the side of a nearby garage while he called for backup. The assailants identified themselves as Jacob Elam and defendant, Daniel McKee, fifteen and sixteen-years-old, respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-9\">\u00b610 At the evidentiary hearing, Officer Hoffman testified that upon arriving at the scene, he approached McKee and directed him to walk <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>with him a distance from Elam and asked him what they had been doing that night. In talking with McKee, Officer Hoffman stated that a woman had reportedly been hit by a baseball bat or some blunt instrument and knocked off her bike by two males in a blue car. Officer Hoffman further advised McKee that he, Elam and their vehicle matched the reported description. McKee responded by stating: \u201cI only hit one of them.\u201d Officer Hoffman inquired as to whether McKee\u2019s response meant that Elam had hit others, to which McKee did not respond. At the evidentiary hearing, Officer Hoffman conceded that he used McKee\u2019s admissions to obtain information from Elam. Throughout this interaction, officers never advised McKee of his <em>Miranda </em>rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\">\u00b611 McKee and Elam were placed under arrest and transported to Missoula City Police Department for further questioning. Officers took no steps to contact McKee\u2019s parents; nor did they inform McKee of his right to have officers notify his parents of his whereabouts. An officer on duty that evening later testified that law enforcement had no obligation to call McKee\u2019s parents, nor did it have to obtain a waiver from McKee with regard to contacting his mother and father.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">\u00b612 Around midnight, two officers took McKee into a room, obtained a waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and interrogated him for approximately an hour and a half. The officers successfully obtained McKee\u2019s admissions that he had struck a woman with a small wooden bat while holding it out the window of a moving vehicle driven by Elam. McKee also admitted that he had tried to strike two other males in a similar fashion. At approximately 1:30 a.m. police contacted McKee\u2019s father, who subsequently called his ex-wife to inform her that their son was in police custody. Based upon McKee\u2019s admissions and those made by Elam, the police further detained McKee, transferring him to Missoula County Detention Center. The next day McKee was transported to Missoula County District Court where the court signed a detention order.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">\u00b613 The prosecution filed an affidavit and motion to charge McKee as an adult by way of information with three counts of felony assault with a weapon. McKee did not receive a hearing regarding whether he should be transferred to Youth Court prior to the filing of the information; instead, the court provided McKee with a hearing eight days after the State charged him as an adult.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">\u00b614 McKee filed consolidated pretrial motions which included: (1) a pre-trial motion pursuant to \u00a7 46-13-101, MCA, to dismiss the information charging McKee as an adult without first filing in Youth Court and conducting a transfer hearing; (2) a motion to suppress any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>statements made by McKee after the stop and any evidence that was a product of those statements; and (3) a motion to suppress McKee\u2019s statements obtained by officers at the police station without notifying his parents. After the evidentiary hearing, the District Court denied all three of McKee\u2019s pre-trial motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-4\">\u00b615 McKee subsequently entered a conditional plea agreement which allowed him to appeal all adverse pre-trial rulings by the court. He then pled guilty to all three counts of felony assault. The District Court sentenced McKee as an adult to ten years with the Department of Corrections, with five years suspended on each count to run concurrently. McKee appeals the court\u2019s adverse pre-trial rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">\u00b616 \u201cThe grant or denial of a motion to dismiss in a criminal case is a question of law which we review <em>de novo </em>on appeal. Our standard of review is plenary, and we determine whether a district court\u2019s conclusion is correct.\u201d <em>State v. Mallak, </em>2005 MT 49, \u00b6 13, 326 Mont. 165, \u00b6 13, 109 P.3d 209, \u00b6 13 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">\u00b617 We review a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress evidence by determining whether the district court\u2019s findings of fact are clearly erroneous and whether those findings were correctly applied as a matter of law. <em>State v. McCollom, </em>2005 MT 61, \u00b6 7, 326 Mont. 251, \u00b6 7, 109 P.3d 215, \u00b6 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A9Xs\">Issue 1</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b275-9\">\n<em>Did the District Court properly deny McKee\u2019s motion to dismiss the information?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b275-11\">\u00b618 McKee argues that before the prosecution filed the information, he was entitled to a hearing to determine whether it was appropriate to prosecute him in district court rather than in youth court. To support his argument, McKee cites <em>State v. Butler, </em>1999 MT 70, \u00b6 32, 294 Mont. 17, \u00b6 32, 977 P.2d 1000, \u00b6 32, in which this Court held \u201cthat the District Court violated Butler\u2019s right to due process as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution when it allowed the prosecution to file an information in District Court pursuant to \u00a7 41-5-206, MCA (1997), without <em>first </em>affording Butler a hearing.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b275-12\">\u00b619 Importantly, at the time we decided <em>Butler, </em>the provisions of \u00a7 41-5-206, MCA, differed from today\u2019s version in that the statute did not include any transfer hearing requirement. Because we determined that the decision to prosecute a youth in district court rather than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>youth court could mean the difference between detaining a minor defendant until age twenty-five or losing his life, we concluded that a decision to transfer a youth to district court \u201cis critically important\u201d warranting a hearing. <em>Butler, </em>\u00b6 26.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-4\">\u00b620  Subsequent to <em>Butler, </em>the Legislature amended \u00a7 41-5-206, MCA, to provide in subsection (3) that \u201c[w]ithin 30 days after leave to file the information is granted, the district court shall conduct a hearing to determine whether the matter must be transferred back to the youth court, unless the hearing is waived by the youth or the youth\u2019s counsel in writing or on the record.\u201d While this provision contradicts <em>Butler </em>insofar as it permits a hearing to be held within thirty days <em>after </em>the information is filed, rather than prior to a filing, we conclude that the statute satisfies the concern we addressed in <em>Butler </em>that due process requires the court to afford a youth \u201cthe opportunity with the assistance of counsel to challenge the prosecution\u2019s allegations that there was probable cause or that the seriousness of the crime or the interests of the community protection required an information to be filed in District Court.\u201d <em>Butler, </em>\u00b6 27. To the extent that <em>Butler </em>requires a hearing before filing in district court, it is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">\u00b621  Because we hold that \u00a7 41-5-206(3), MCA, of Montana\u2019s Youth Court Act satisfies due process requirements and the District Court complied with this statute by providing McKee, represented by counsel, a full opportunity to present evidence and argument concerning the appropriate forum for the prosecution of his case, we conclude that the District Court did not commit error when it denied McKee\u2019s motion to dismiss the information.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-6\">Issue 2</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-7\">\n<em>Did the District Court err when it denied McKee\u2019s motion to suppress admissions he made prior to the time law enforcement contacted his parents?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">\u00b622 \u201cUnder the Montana Youth Court Act, a youth taken into custody for questioning upon a matter that could result in allegations that the youth is delinquent <em>must </em>be advised of his right against self-incrimination and his right to counsel, and the youth\u2019s parents <em>must </em>be immediately notified by the investigating officer.\u201d <em>In the Matter of C.T.P., </em>2004 MT 63, \u00b6 24, 320 Mont. 279, \u00b6 24, 87 P.3d 399, \u00b6 24. Section 41-5-331, MCA, states the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b276-9\">41-5-331. Rights of youth taken into custody-questioning-waiver of rights. (1) When a youth is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>taken into custody for questioning upon a matter that could result in a petition alleging that the youth is either a delinquent youth or a youth in need of intervention, the following requirements must be met:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-4\">(a) The youth must be advised of the youth\u2019s right against self-incrimination and the youth\u2019s right to counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-5\">(b) The investigating officer, probation officer, or person assigned to give notice shall immediately notify the parents, guardian, or legal custodian of the youth that the youth has been taken into custody, the reasons for taking the youth into custody, and where the youth is being held. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-6\">(2) A youth may waive the rights listed in subsection (1) under the following situations:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b277-7\">(a) when the youth is 16 years of age or older, the youth may make an effective waiverL]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">\u00b623 McKee argues that when law enforcement took him into custody, it should have, pursuant to \u00a7 41-5-331(l)(b), MCA, immediately notified his parents or, pursuant to subsection (2)(a), advised him that he could waive the right to parental notification. Because the officers failed to do so, McKee contends that the admissions he made in the three and a half hours prior to the time his parents were notified should have been suppressed by the District Court. The court denied McKee\u2019s motion to suppress because it interpreted \u00a7 41-5-331, MCA, as providing the parents, not the youth, with the right to notification-\u201cthe parent notification is not a right that is personal to the youth that requires a waiver.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">\u00b624 The State argues that the District Court correctly interpreted \u00a7 41-5-331, MCA, when it denied McKee\u2019s motion to suppress. While conceding that subsection (l)(b) of the statute mandates that law enforcement \u201cshall immediately notify the parents\u201d of a youth taken into custody, as well as the reasons for the custody and where the youth is being held, the State argues that this \u201cright\u201d belongs to the parents. The State therefore argues that it was not required to obtain a waiver of parental notification from McKee before the police questioned him. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">\u00b625 We interpret \u00a7 41-5-331, MCA, as operating in accordance with its title-that is, it protects the \u201c[r]ights of youth taken into custody.\u201d Interpreted as a whole, subsection (1) ensures that a youth taken into custody understands his rights; subsection (l)(a) mandates that law enforcement must advise a youth of his right against self-incrimination and his right to counsel, while subsection (l)(b) states that law enforcement \u201cshall immediately notify the parents, guardian, or legal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>custodian ....\u201d These subsections compliment each other, in that the latter allows parents the opportunity to assist their child in deciding whether to waive his or her rights or alternatively, obtain counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"Aujx\">\u00b626 [3] Moreover, we read the right of parental notification as belonging to the youth, not to the parents. The plain language of subsection (2)(a) states that \u201c[a] youth may waive the rights listed in subsection (1) ... when the youth is 16 years of age or older ....\u201d Consequently, the right to parental notification belonged to McKee, not his parents. While McKee signed a written waiver of his right against self-incrimination and his right to counsel, he did not waive his right to parental notification. We therefore conclude that the District Court should have suppressed the statements provided to law enforcement before McKee\u2019s parents were notified.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-4\">Issue 3</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b278-5\">\n<em>Did the District Court properly deny McKee\u2019s motion to suppress his admission made at the scene of the investigatory stop ?</em>\n</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">\u00b627 \u201cThe Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 25, of the Montana Constitution provide that no person shall be compelled, in any criminal case, to be a witness against himself.\u201d <em>State v. Olson, </em>2003 MT 61, \u00b6 13, 314 Mont. 402, \u00b6 13, 66 P.3d 297, \u00b6 13. In <em>Miranda v. Arizona </em>(1966), 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694, the Supreme Court \u201cheld that the prosecution may not use statements that stem from a custodial interrogation of a defendant unless the defendant is warned, prior to questioning, that he has a right to remain silent, that any statement he does make may be used as evidence against him, and that he has a right to the presence of an attorney.\u201d <em>Olson, </em>\u00b6 13 (citing <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 444, 86 S.Ct. at 1612, 16 L.Ed.2d at 706).</p>\n<p id=\"b278-8\">\u00b628 McKee argues that his Fifth Amendment and state constitutional rights were violated when law enforcement inquired as to \u201cwhat they had been doing,\u201d while McKee, at the direction of the officers, stood with his hands on the wall, facing the side of a nearby garage. We have previously held that \u201c[a] person is entitled to <em>Miranda </em>warnings only if he or she is subject to a custodial interrogation.\u201d <em>Olson, </em>\u00b6 14 (citing <em>State v. Elison, </em>2000 MT 288, \u00b6 27, 302 Mont. 228, \u00b6 27, 14 P.3d 456, \u00b6 27). A custodial interrogation occurs when there is a significant restriction of personal liberty similar to an arrest-in other words, \u201cif a person has no free right to leave, then the interrogation is custodial.\u201d <em>Olson, </em>\u00b6 15 (citations omitted). This Court examines the following six factors in determining whether or not a custodial interrogation has occurred: (1) place of the interrogation; (2) time of the interrogation; (3) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>persons present during the interrogation; (4) whether <em>Miranda </em>warnings were gratuitously given; (5) the length and mood of the interrogation; and (6) whether or not the suspect was arrested following the interrogation. <em>Olson, </em>\u00b6 15 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b279-4\">\u00b629 In <em>Olson, </em>police officers stopped the defendant\u2019s vehicle and removed her from the car. An officer approached Olson and informed her that he knew a meth lab had been placed in the trunk of her car. Initially, Olson denied the allegation, but after the officer spoke to her about the health risks of a meth lab, she admitted that the equipment was located in her vehicle. <em>Olson, </em>\u00b6 8. This Court held that the officer \u201cshould have known that his statements were reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from Olson\u201d and \u201cbecause Olson did not receive <em>Miranda </em>warnings before she was interrogated by [the officer], the statements she made ... were obtained in violation of her Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, and must he suppressed.\u201d <em>Olson, </em>\u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">\u00b630 In this case, Officer Guy stopped McKee and Elam as they exited their vehicle and directed them to face a garage with their arms and hands on the wall. According to Officer Guy\u2019s own admission, at this point the young men were not free to go. When Officer Hoffman arrived at the scene, he directed McKee to walk with him and then elicited incriminating statements from McKee by telling him that he and Elam matched a woman\u2019s description of assailants who hit her on the head with a blunt instrument while she was riding her bike. When the prosecution asked Officer Hoffman at the suppression hearing why he asked McKee to walk away with him, Officer Hoffman testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-6\">[Officer]: Well, we wanted to keep them separate. A lot of times, just their general eye contact with each other, verbal contact, can change their stories or fabricate a story, so we like to separate potential victims - witnesses or - or suspects.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-7\">[Prosecutor]: Okay. And did you have a conversation with him then?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-8\">[Officer] Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-9\">[Prosecutor]: Okay. Tell us about that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b279-10\">[Officer]: Walked him away. I made him [stand] with his back towards the other subject. I could keep my visual on both of them at that time. And I asked what they had been doing.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b279-11\">\u00b631  We noted in <em>Olson </em>that an \u201c\u2018interrogation\u2019 in the context of the Fifth Amendment and Article II, Section 25, of the Montana Constitution, refers not only to express questioning, but also to any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>words or actions on the part of the police (other than those normally attendant to arrest and custody) that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect.\u201d <em>Olson, </em>\u00b6 18 (citations and quotations omitted). In analyzing whether an officer\u2019s words \u201care reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response,\u201d we focus on the perception of the suspect, not the intent of the officer. <em>Olson, </em>\u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">\u00b632 At the time Officer Hoffman directed McKee to walk with him in order to elicit a statement, three armed, badged and uniformed police officers were present at the scene. McKee did not feel free to leave, nor was he. Moreover, Officer Hoffman\u2019s testimony illustrates that when he approached McKee the \u201cmood of the investigation\u201d was one which focused on the clear potential that McKee was a suspect and which prompted an incriminating statement from him. After police identified McKee as matching the physical description of the suspects, he was separated by police in order to isolate him from Elam and impede his ability to \u201cfabricate a story.\u201d Then, McKee was asked an open-ended question about his activities that night. Finally, he was advised that police were investigating reports of physical assaults. This evidence demonstrates that the officers intended to obtain a statement from McKee about McKee\u2019s involvement in the assaults under investigation. As such, a <em>Miranda </em>warning was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">\u00b633  Given the circumstances surrounding law enforcement\u2019s questioning of McKee prior to his arrest and in the absence of <em>Miranda </em>warnings, we conclude that an illegal custodial interrogation took place. Consequently, the District Court should have suppressed McKee\u2019s admissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">\u00b634 We conclude that the District Court did not commit error when it conducted a transfer hearing eight days after the filing of the information, rather than before. However, we conclude that the District Court erred when it failed to suppress the statements McKee provided to law enforcement before his parents were notified and without a waiver of such notification, as well as the evidence obtained by officers prior to McKee\u2019s arrest and without <em>Miranda </em>warnings. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this decision.</p>\n<judges id=\"b280-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES WARNER, MORRIS, COTTER, RICE and NELSON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
