We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">\u00b62 The issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in excluding testimony offered by Spencer to show that his speedometer was working incorrectly and the size of his vehicle\u2019s tires had an effect on the speedometer.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-10\">\u00b63 During the early morning hours of April 25,2003, Deputy Sheriff Micky Eckart (Eckart) saw a pickup driving on Highway 87 at a high rate of speed. Eckart\u2019s radar determined that the pickup was traveling 57 m.p.h. in a 45 m.p.h. zone. Eckart turned around to pursue the pickup, which appeared to speed up. Eckart had to drive 95 m.p.h. to catch the pickup. Once the pickup was pulled over, Eckart learned that Spencer was the driver. Eckart could smell a strong odor of alcohol coming from Spencer, and observed that his eyes were bloodshot and glossy. Eckart then had Spencer perform standard field sobriety tests.</p>\n<p id=\"A1b\">\u00b64 Spencer\u2019s smell, appearance and poor test performance led to his arrest for driving under the influence (DUI).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-11\">\u00b65 Spencer was initially found guilty of DUI in Justice Court. He appealed to the District Court and filed a notice that he intended to call one Wes Nelson (Nelson) as an expert witness to testify that the speedometer in Spencer\u2019s pickup had not been functioning properly. The State objected to Nelson\u2019s testimony in a motion in limine. The District Court granted this motion, explaining that Nelson\u2019s testimony was irrelevant. Nelson was found guilty of DUI in District Court and judgment was entered on September 7, 2004. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"Anl\">\u00b66 We review a district court\u2019s evidentiary ruling to determine whether the district court abused its discretion. <em>Payne v. Knutson, </em>2004 MT 271, \u00b6 20, 323 Mont. 165, \u00b6 20, 99 P.3d 200, \u00b6 20. <em>\u201cA </em>district court abuses its discretion when it acts arbitrarily without employment of conscientious judgment or exceeds the bounds of reason, resulting in substantial injustice.\u201d <em>State v. Riggs, </em>2005 MT 124, \u00b6 18, 327 Mont. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>196, \u00b6 18, 113 P.3d 281, \u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">\u00b67 Spencer argues that the speed of a vehicle is relevant in determining whether a driver\u2019s ability to safely operate a vehicle has been diminished, citing <em>Bauer v. State </em>(1996), 275 Mont. 119, 126, 910 P.2d 886, 890, and <em>State v. Palmer </em>(1991), 247 Mont. 210, 217, 805 P.2d 580, 584. He contends that the District Court abused its discretion in excluding the offered testimony on the grounds that it was irrelevant. He also argues that, even if Nelson was not an expert, he should have been allowed to testify as a lay witness regarding the effect of a vehicle\u2019s tire-size on a vehicle\u2019s speedometer.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">\u00b68 The State argues that in this case the speed of Spencer\u2019s truck is relevant only concerning whether Eckart had a particularized suspicion to stop Spencer, because speed had no part in the DUI charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">\u00b69 In <em>Bauer, </em>this Court concluded that a deputy\u2019s observation of a vehicle crossing the center line and driving at a speed well over the speed limit sufficiently supported a particularized suspicion that an offense had been committed. <em>Bauer, </em>275 Mont. at 126, 910 P.2d at 890. In <em>Bauer, </em>as in this case, speed was not a part of the proof of impaired driving. The proof of impaired driving focused on the defendant\u2019s breath, eyes, speech, and performance of physical maneuvers. <em>Bauer, </em>275 Mont. at 126-27, 910 P.2d at 890. Thus, <em>Bauer </em>does not assist Spencer\u2019s argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">\u00b610 In <em>Palmer, </em>this Court concluded that speeding, as well as swerving off the road, plunging over two embankments, driving down ditches, driving across fields, smashing through a fence, and failing to stop for three police officers suggested that the driver was intoxicated. <em>Palmer, </em>247 Mont. at 217, 805 P.2d at 584. Again, in the present case the State did not attempt to prove that Spencer was intoxicated because he was speeding. Thus, <em>Palmer </em>is inapposite.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">\u00b611  Spencer argues, in effect, that his ability to drive was not diminished because he justifiably thought he was going slower than he was. To support this argument, he offered evidence regarding the alleged improper functioning of the speedometer. Such evidence is not relevant to whether a person is driving under the influence of an intoxicating substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">\u00b612  We decline to reverse the District Court\u2019s discretionary decision to exclude the offered evidence in this instance where the State did not attempt to prove that Spencer\u2019s ability to drive was diminished because he was speeding. In excluding the offered evidence the District Court did not act arbitrarily, without employment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>conscientious judgment, and its decision did not exceed the bounds of reason, resulting in substantial injustice.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-4\">\u00b613 As we conclude that evidence concerning the speedometer in Spencer\u2019s pickup was properly excluded, it is not necessary to discuss whether Nelson could give his expert opinion under Rule 702, M.R.Evid., or his lay opinion under Rule 701, M.R.Evid.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">\u00b614 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b105-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, NELSON and RICE concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
