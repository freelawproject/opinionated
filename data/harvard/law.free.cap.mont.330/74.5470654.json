Lynch appeals from the judgment and order deferring imposition of sentence entered by the Eighth Judicial District Court, Cascade County, upon his plea of nolo contendere to the felony offense of criminal endangerment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-24\">\u00b62 The restated issue on appeal is whether the District Court erred in denying Lynch\u2019s assertion of the affirmative defense of renunciation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>with respect to the charge of solicitation to commit deliberate homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">\u00b63 In January of 2004, the State of Montana charged Lynch by Information with the felony offense of solicitation to commit deliberate homicide. In the supporting affidavit, the State alleged that on December 22, 2003, Clifford Wagner sent a \u201ckite\u201d from the Cascade County jail to a sheriffs deputy, stating he had information \u201con someone trying to hire me to kill their wife.\u201d The affidavit further stated Wagner later told deputies Lynch had asked him to \u201ctake care of his wife\u201d in exchange for Lynch acting as his attorney in certain criminal and civil matters.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">\u00b64 Law enforcement arranged for Wagner\u2019s release so he could make the following recorded call to Lynch, a transcript of which appeared in the affidavit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-7\">CW: I walked by your old lady\u2019s house[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-8\">JL: (laughs)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-9\">CW: Yea. Yea it has this sign in there ... is say\u2019s [sic] go to the Back[J</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-10\">JL: yea, yea that it... well I don\u2019t know,... leave her alone[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-11\">CW: are you sure[?]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-12\">JL: yea, I\u2019m going to fuck her up with a, I\u2019m going to sue the shit out of her, I don\u2019t need, I don\u2019t need you getting in any more trouble, leading to me getting into trouble, and both of us showing up in prison, so just leave her alone ... maybe that will change. I don\u2019t know now but leave her alone for now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-13\">CW: for right now just leave her alone[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-14\">JL: but here\u2019s the thing... is that she ... I, I filed a lawsuit against her as soon as I got out[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-15\">CW: she is just going to keep fucking with you[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-16\">JL: I know she is but, I, I, I, I don\u2019t know ... I\u2019m hoping that if I sue the shit out of her she\u2019ll stop, so anyway I, I filed this lawsuit against her and I, the sheriff served it on her yesterday so I\u2019m fully prepared she\u2019s mad as hell about this and the Billings Police are going to come and arrest me and transport me to Great Falls in a fucking week or something. So I know just she, she\u2019s such a fucking psycho, I don\u2019t want to fuck with her just leave her alone[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-17\">CW: did you already have someone else or somethingf.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b97-18\">JL: uhhh[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>CW: did you already ask someone else ... OK[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-4\">JL: no, no[.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-5\">CW: I don\u2019t mind ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-6\">JL: I want, I want to make a big, big bunch of money on your case ... (laughs) and I don\u2019t want, I don\u2019t want to screw that up by you going to prison and me going to prison or anything else so, let\u2019s just lay back for now.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">\u00b65 Lynch initially pled not guilty. He subsequently filed a notice that he would \u201crely on the affirmative defense of RENUNCIATION/WITHDRAWAL.\u201d After a hearing, the District Court denied Lynch\u2019s assertion of the affirmative defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">\u00b66 In December of 2004, Lynch and the State executed a plea agreement, pursuant to which Lynch would plead nolo contendere to the amended charge of criminal endangerment, a felony. Lynch reserved the right to appeal the denial of his assertion of the affirmative defense of renunciation/withdrawal. At a hearing, Lynch pled nolo contendere to the criminal endangerment charge and the District Court accepted the plea. After a separate hearing, the court entered judgment, deferred sentencing for two years subject to conditions, and ordered Lynch\u2019s probation officer to submit a report with recommendations in one year. Lynch appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b98-10\">\u00b67 The District Court\u2019s determination that Lynch was not entitled to assert the affirmative defense of renunciation is a legal conclusion. We review conclusions of law for correctness. <em>See State v. Polaski, </em>2005 MT 13, \u00b6 10, 325 Mont. 351, \u00b6 10, 106 P.3d 538, \u00b6 10 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-11\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b98-12\">\u00b68 <em>Did the District Court err in denying Lynch\u2019s assertion of the affirmative defense of renunciation with respect to the original charge of solicitation?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b98-13\">\u00b69 A person commits the offense of solicitation when, with the purpose that an offense be committed, he or she commands, encourages, or facilitates the commission of that offense. Section 45-4-101(1), MCA. Lynch concedes the Montana Legislature has not codified renunciation as an affirmative defense to a solicitation charge. He asserts, however, that he \u201cshould have been entitled to assert the affirmative defense of renunciation as it certainly applied in his case, and imposed no additional burden on the State to prove any element.\u201d \u00b610 Relying on <em>State v. Bullock </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 361, 382, 901 P.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>61, 74, Lynch contends states must afford their citizens protections equal to or greater than those afforded by the federal Constitution. The portion of <em>Bullock </em>advanced by Lynch concerned constitutional, rather than statutory, issues. <em>See Bullock, </em>272 Mont. at 382, 901 P.2d at 74. <em>Bullock </em>does not require that the Montana Legislature must enact statutes to \u201cmatch\u201d federal statutes. Therefore, Lynch\u2019s reliance on <em>Bullock </em>is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\">\u00b611 Lynch also asserts that Arizona has enacted Ariz. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 13-1005, a state statute that, like the federal statute 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 373, recognizes renunciation as an affirmative defense to a solicitation charge. We acknowledge that, like Arizona, several states have enacted statutes setting forth \u201cvoluntary\u201d and \u201ccomplete\u201d renunciation as an affirmative defense to a charge of solicitation. <em>See, e.g., </em>Ark. Code Ann. \u00a7 5-3-302; Colo. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 18-2-301(4); Del. Code Ann. tit. 11, \u00a7 541; Haw. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 705-530(2); Idaho Code \u00a7 18-2003; Kan. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 21-3303(c). State legislatures are free to adopt a wide variety of statutory affirmative defenses. The Montana Legislature, however, has not enacted the affirmative defense of renunciation with respect to a charge of solicitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">\u00b612 Lynch also observes that a person charged with an offense under a theory of accountability may assert a defense similar to renunciation. Section 45-2-302(3)(b), MCA, provides, in part, that a person charged with an offense under a theory of accountability</p>\n<p id=\"AKy\">is not so accountable if:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-6\">(b) before the commission of the offense, he terminates his effort to promote or facilitate such commission and does one of the following:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-7\">(i) wholly deprives his prior efforts of effectiveness in such commission;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-8\">(ii) gives timely warning to the proper law enforcement authorities; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-9\">(iii) otherwise makes proper effort to prevent the commission of the offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-10\">In this regard, we note that \u00a7 45-4-103(4), MCA, sets forth an affirmative defense involving \u201cvoluntary and complete renunciation\u201d with respect to a charge of attempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-11\">\u00b613 Here, the State did not charge Lynch with deliberate homicide under a theory of accountability; nor did it charge him with attempt. In any event, the State has broad discretion in making charging decisions and, when the facts of a case support more than one possible <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>charge, the crime to be charged is a matter of prosecutorial discretion. <em>See State v. Cameron, </em>2005 MT 32, \u00b6 17, 326 Mont. 51, \u00b6 17, 106 P.3d 1189, \u00b6 17 (citations omitted). The issue here is whether the affirmative defense of renunciation is available with respect to the offense charged, which was solicitation to commit deliberate homicide. Whether the affirmative defense is statutorily available for other possible charges is irrelevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-4\">\u00b614 Next, Lynch asserts Montana has \u201ccodified several other common law affirmative defenses\u201d in \u00a7 46-15-323(2), MCA. Section 46-15-323(2), MCA, imposes a requirement on a criminal defendant to disclose any intention to introduce evidence at trial of good character or certain delineated defenses. Lynch advances no authorities, as required by Rule 23(a)(4), M.R.App.P., in support of his assertion that this statute constitutes a \u201ccodification\u201d of common law defenses or his apparent position that renunciation is a common law defense to solicitation. Thus, we decline to address this assertion further.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-5\">\u00b615 Lynch also argues that, if he had proceeded to trial without being allowed to assert renunciation as an affirmative defense and obtain a jury instruction to that effect, the State would have \u201celevate[d] Wagner\u2019s credibility in an account of an inherently unreliable, unrecorded oral conversation over a transcribed, telephonic conversation where Lynch\u2019s intent is clear\u201d and the jury would have \u201cfocus[ed] on Wagner\u2019s statements regarding <em>his </em>interpretation of the conversation.\u201d In this regard, he points to the State\u2019s argument in the District Court that \u201cthe crime of solicitation is complete at the time that [Lynch], with the intent that the crime be committed, solicited.\u201d His argument is-and must remain-entirely speculative because Lynch chose not to proceed to trial, thereby waiving his ability to directly challenge Wagner\u2019s credibility through all available means.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">\u00b616 Lynch devotes the remainder of his appellate brief to summarizing several cases from Montana and other jurisdictions regarding the sufficiency of the evidence to support a finding that an individual committed solicitation of an offense, and apparently argues these cases have some application to the \u201cpurpose that an offense be committed\u201d element of solicitation. The cases are irrelevant to the issue preserved for appeal, which is whether the District Court improperly denied Lynch\u2019s assertion of renunciation as an affirmative defense to the solicitation charge. Furthermore, having pled nolo contendere to an amended charge, Lynch cannot now be heard to challenge the State\u2019s ability to prove the requisite elements of the originally charged offense beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number><em>Nichols, </em>1998 MT 271, \u00b6 11, 291 Mont. 367, \u00b6 11, 970 P.2d 79, \u00b6 11. Therefore, we decline to address these cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-4\">\u00b617  We hold the District Court did not err in denying Lynch\u2019s assertion of the affirmative defense of renunciation with respect to the original charge of solicitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">\u00b618 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b101-6\">JUSTICES RICE, LEAPHART, MORRIS and NELSON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
