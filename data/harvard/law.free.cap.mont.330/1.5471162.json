(International). Respondent, Lori Oberson (Oberson), is Musselman\u2019s sister who serves as the guardian and conservator of Musselman\u2019s estate, as he is incapacitated. Upon her motion, the District Court granted Oberson summary judgment, concluding that Montana law governs this case and prevents subrogation from Musselman\u2019s personal injury tort award until Musselman is made whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-9\">\u00b62 Federated appeals the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in Oberson\u2019s favor. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-10\">ISSUE</p>\n<p id=\"b24-11\">\u00b63 The restated dispositive issue on appeal is whether Montana law governs a subrogation claim brought by a workers\u2019 compensation insurer for reimbursement of benefits paid to a Michigan worker who, injured while working in Montana, recovered a third-party personal injury judgment in a Montana court?</p>\n<p id=\"b24-12\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b24-13\">\u00b64 On February 25,1996, Musselman, a Michigan resident, suffered an incapacitating head injury while working in Montana for his Michigan-based employer, International. Following his injury, Musselman filed a workers\u2019 compensation claim in Michigan. Concurrently, Musselman filed a personal injury claim against third-party tortfeasors in Montana pursuant to which the United States District Court for the District of Montana awarded him a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>$11,296,800.00 judgment. After extensive litigation regarding the legitimacy of Musselman\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation claim, the Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed that Musselman was acting in the course and scope of his employment when he was injured. <em>(See Musselman v. International Engineering &amp; Mfg., Inc. </em>(Mich. 2002), 651 N.W.2d 912 (Table), denying reconsideration). Federated then paid Musselman workers\u2019 compensation benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-4\">\u00b65 Musselman\u2019s injuries are catastrophic and the cost of his life-long care will be exorbitant. In granting Musselman $11,296,800.00 in damages, Montana\u2019s federal court found that Musselman\u2019s injury resulted in cerebral spastic quadriparesis and an inability to swallow or speak. Musselman now resides in an adult care facility. He will be fully dependent on others and will require 24-hour care to attend to his basic needs such as feeding, bathing, grooming, and dressing, for the rest of his life. Unfortunately, Musselman will never recover the full amount of the judgment awarded him by Montana\u2019s federal court, as the court apportioned 10% of the fault for Musselman\u2019s accident to Musselman himself, 40% to the United States Forest Service, and 50% to an insolvent third-party defendant. Also, costs and attorney fees incurred in the litigation of Musselman\u2019s claims further reduced his recovery of the awarded judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">\u00b66 Federated filed a subrogation claim against Musselman\u2019s Montana personal injury award in Michigan\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation court. In response, Oberson, on behalf of Musselman, filed this declaratory action in Montana. On March 12, 2004, Oberson filed a motion for summary judgment in the District Court seeking a declaration that (1) Montana law governs the enforceability of Federated\u2019s subrogation interest, and (2) Montana law bars Federated from recovering on a subrogation claim until Musselman is made whole. Federated filed a cross-motion for summary judgment contending that Montana lacks jurisdiction over this dispute and Michigan law should control.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">\u00b67 The District Court heard oral argument on July 12, 2004, and on September 28, 2004, the District Court granted Oberson\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b25-8\">\u00b68 We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, and apply the same criteria applied by the district court pursuant to Rule 56(c), M.R.Civ.P. <em>Hanson v. Water Ski Mania Estates, </em>2005 MT 47, \u00b6 11, 326 Mont. 154, \u00b6 11, 108 P.3d 481, \u00b6 11. A district court properly grants summary judgment only when no genuine issues of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>material fact exist, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Baumgardner v. Pub. Empl. Bd. of State, </em>2005 MT 199, \u00b6 14, 328 Mont. 179, \u00b6 14, 119 P.3d 77, \u00b6 14 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b26-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b26-5\">\u00b69 We are asked by the parties to determine whether Montana\u2019s or Michigan\u2019s substantive law governs Federated\u2019s subrogation interest in Musselman\u2019s third-party tort award. The underlying facts are not in dispute. Further, the parties agree that if Michigan law applies, the District Court lacked jurisdiction to grant summary judgment and Michigan\u2019s courts are free to allow subrogation in keeping with Michigan law. The parties also agree that if Montana law applies, our well-established \u201cmade whole\u201d doctrine proscribes subrogation here.</p>\n<p id=\"A3y\">\u00b610 First, Federated contends that comity demands we defer to Michigan\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation court to determine Federated\u2019s subrogation interests in proceedings now pending before that tribunal. Comity is \u201cnot a rule of law\u201d but rather \u201can expression of one state\u2019s entirely voluntary decision to defer to the policy of another.\u201d <em>Simmons v. State </em>(1983), 206 Mont. 264, 289, 670 P.2d 1372, 1385 (citations omitted). Federated points us to <em>Siira v. Employers Mut. Liability Insurance Co. </em>(Mich. Ct. App. 1979), 274 N.W.2d 26. In that case a Montana resident, injured in Montana, received benefits under Montana\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, and subsequently recovered a third-party judgment in Michigan. The Michigan Court of Appeals determined Montana law governed a subrogation-related dispute between Mr. Siira and his employer\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation insurer. Notably missing from the <em>Siira </em>court\u2019s decision, however, is any discussion suggesting a Michigan public policy interest in retaining jurisdiction over the subrogation issue. In contrast, as illustrated below, Montana\u2019s firm public policy disallowing subrogation prior to full recovery by damaged parties is embodied in Article II, Section 16 of Montana\u2019s Constitution, and has been applied repeatedly by this Court. Therefore, with all due respect to Michigan\u2019s court, we reject Federated\u2019s comity argument, and decline to voluntarily relinquish jurisdiction over this dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b26-6\">\u00b611  In the alternative, Federated argues that if Montana does have jurisdiction, the Montana Workers\u2019 Compensation Court is the proper forum for resolution. We reject this contention. Montana\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Court maintains limited jurisdiction over benefits flowing from Montana\u2019s Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Section 39-71-2905, MCA. Federated concedes Musselman never filed for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>workers\u2019 compensation benefits in Montana. The monetary recovery implicated here flows exclusively from tort damages suffered in Montana, adjudicated in federal civil court, and directed by Montana\u2019s substantive tort law. Therefore, Montana\u2019s Worker Compensation Court has no jurisdiction over this subrogation issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-4\">\u00b612 Finally, Federated urges this Court to adopt \u00a7 185 of the Restatement (Second) on Conflict of Laws (\u00a7185) concerning workers\u2019 compensation subrogation. Section 185 provides that the local law of the state in which workers\u2019 compensation benefits were paid shall determine what interest the benefit-paying entity has in any recovery for tort. Were we to agree with Federated, Michigan law would be applied to this dispute.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-5\">\u00b613 This Court has not adopted the Restatements of Law whole cloth, opting instead to evaluate the language and provisions of the Restatements in light of Montana\u2019s public policies and the Legislature\u2019s statutory guidance. <em>Compare Phillips v. General Motors Corp., </em>2000 MT 55, \u00b6 23, 298 Mont. 438, \u00b6 23, 995 P.2d 1002, \u00b6 23 (a conflict of law case where we adopted the \u201cmost significant relationship\u201d test from the Restatement (Second) on Conflict of Laws to determine the applicable substantive law for issues in tort) to <em>Sternhagen v. Dow Co. </em>(1997), 282 Mont. 168, 173-74, 935 P.2d 1139, 1142, (where we acknowledged previous adoption of Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 402A but rejected corresponding comments to that section as inconsistent with established Montana law) and <em>Warnack v. Conen Family Trust </em>(1996), 278 Mont. 80, 87, 923 P.2d 1087, 1091 (where we declined to adopt \u00a7\u00a7 478 and 479 of the Restatement of Property which contradict Montana jurisprudence). Moreover, in choice of law cases, this Court has consistently rejected rigid rules, favoring the modern trend toward a \u201cmore flexible approach which permits analysis of the policies and interests underlying the particular issue before the court.\u201d <em>Phillips, </em>\u00b6 22 (citation omitted). Finally, as noted above, the workers\u2019 compensation context giving rise to the parties\u2019 relationship here is of no legal consequence, as the money Federated seeks flows directly from Musselman\u2019s injury in Montana, to which Montana\u2019s federal court applied Montana tort law to conclude that damages were warranted. In light of these factors, we decline to adopt and apply \u00a7 185 here.</p>\n<p id=\"b27-6\">\u00b614 This Court has consistently interpreted the language of Article II, Section 16 as precluding the subrogation of a tort award until the damaged party fully recovers. Article II, Section 16 of the Montana Constitution provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>Courts of justice shall be open to every person, and speedy remedy afforded for every injury of person, property, or character. No person shall be deprived of this full legal redress for injury incurred in employment for which another person may be liable except as to fellow employees and his immediate employer who hired him if such immediate employer provides coverage under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Laws of this state. Right and justice shall be administered without sale, denial, or delay.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aq\">Based on this provision and the equities flowing therefrom, Montana has rebuked the insurance industry\u2019s efforts to garnish an accident victim\u2019s third-party recovery. In <em>Francetich v. State Comp. Mut. Ins. Fund, </em>we held that Article II, Section 16 expressly prohibits efforts to restrict the right to obtain full legal redress against third-party tortfeasors:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-4\">The record of the debate at the Convention is clear that this was the delegates\u2019 intent in amending the provision. The second sentence [of Article II, Section 16] is mandatory, prohibitive, and self-executing and it prohibits depriving an employee of his full legal redress, recoverable under general tort law, against third parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b28-5\"><em>Francetich </em>(1992), 252 Mont. 215, 224, 827 P.2d 1279, 1285.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-6\">\u00b615 We reaffirmed this \u201cmade whole\u201d doctrine in <em>Trankel v. State Dept. of Military Affairs, </em>expanding its principles to protect against interference by either the federal courts or foreign jurisdictions. <em>Trankel </em>(1997), 282 Mont. 348, 938 P.2d 614.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b28-7\">[A]ny statute or court decision which deprives an employee of his right to full legal redress, as defined by the general tort law of this state against third parties, is absolutely prohibited. The second sentence of [Article II, Section 16] is mandatory and self-executing, and leaves no room for erosion based on what federal courts or the courts of other states would do pursuant to federal laws or the laws of other states. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b28-8\"><em>Trankel, </em>282 Mont. at 362, 938 P.2d at 623.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-9\">\u00b616 Musselman cites two illustrative cases in which this Court applied Montana law to prohibit subrogation by out-of-state insurers. In one personal injury case, we rejected subrogation efforts by an Oregon insurer, and found in favor of a Washington resident injured in Montana, stating that subrogation of medical benefits in Montana is void as against public policy. <em>Youngblood v. American States Ins. Co. </em>(1993), 262 Mont. 391, 400, 866 P.2d 203, 208. Later, we held that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>third-party recovery in Montana could not be subjected to a Colorado insurance policy\u2019s \u201cchoice of law\u201d provision, as Colorado law would trigger subrogation rights resulting in violation of Montana\u2019s \u201cmade whole\u201d doctrine. <em>Swanson v. Hartford Ins. Co. of Midwest, </em>2002 MT 81, \u00b6 33, 309 Mont. 269, \u00b6 33, 46 P.3d 584, \u00b6 33.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\">\u00b617  <em>Trankel, Youngblood, </em>and <em>Swanson </em>are determinative in our choice of law analysis here. Montana\u2019s public policy, as defined in Article II, Section 16, precludes application of Michigan subrogation law to Musselman\u2019s personal injury recovery until Musselman realizes the full measure of his adjudicated damages. As the parties agree that application of Montana law precludes subrogation by Federated in keeping with Montana\u2019s \u201cmade whole\u201d doctrine, we need not review the District Court\u2019s application of Montana law.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b29-6\">\u00b618 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b29-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, LEAPHART and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
