During trial, the District Court admitted a number of hearsay statements from the victim, Mizenko\u2019s wife, Debra. Mizenko appeals. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-11\">\u00b62 The issue is: Were Debra\u2019s statements testimonial?<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b323-12\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b323-13\">\u00b63 The Chouteau County Attorney filed an information charging Mizenko with Partner or Family Member Assault in violation of \u00a7 45-5-206, MCA. Dawn Grove, the Mizenkos\u2019 neighbor, testified at trial that Debra was out of breath when she appeared at the Groves\u2019 house late one afternoon. Debra had a wound on her cheek or jaw area. Grove testified that Debra asked her to call 911 as well as a friend, Carol Richard. Grove called 911 and handed the phone to Debra. Tami King answered the 911 call.</p>\n<p id=\"b323-14\">\u00b64 Although the State subpoenaed Debra, she failed to appear at trial. Grove testified that Debra \u201csaid that her husband had been drinking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>and was trying to hurt her.\u201d Seeking clarification of Debra\u2019s statement to her, the prosecutor asked Grove: \u201cAnd you stated that he had been drinking and had hurt her?\u201d Yes,\u201d Grove replied.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-4\">\u00b65 Presumably relying on the excited utterance exception of Rule 803(2), M.R.Evid., the District Court overruled an objection to the following testimony from King about her conversation with Debra.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-5\">[Prosecution]: Do you recall what Mrs. Mizenko told you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-6\">[King]: She said that Greg hit her, pushed her down and she had hair-he had pullen [sic] out her hair.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-8\">[Prosecution]: Okay. Did she request law enforcement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b324-9\">[King]: Yes. She wanted him arrested, is what she said.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b324-10\">Without objection from Mizenko, the court also allowed the prosecution to play the audiotape of the 911 call for the jury. On the tape, Debra, breathing heavily and in a cracking and wavering voice, states, \u201che hit me, pulled out my hair, knocked me down. I tried so hard not to call [gasp], but umm, this is ridiculous. I can\u2019t do this anymore.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-11\">\u00b66 Officer Scott Buennemeyer testified that when he arrived at the Mizenko home, he saw a bruise on Debra\u2019s face. As he walked through the house, he saw pens and pencils and dog food on the floor of the kitchen. He saw a lock of hair near the pet bowl in the kitchen and another lock of hair on the floor in the living room. The District Court twice sustained foundational objections to Buennemeyer\u2019s testimony that the hair was Debra\u2019s. Finally, the prosecution asked Buennemeyer, \u201cDid Debra Mizenko tell you where this hair came from?\u201d Overruling Mizenko\u2019s hearsay objection, the District Court allowed Buennemeyer to answer. He testified, \u2018Yes, she did. She told me it was her hair, pulled from her head, during an altercation at her residence, at that time and date.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b324-12\">\u00b67 After the State rested, Mizenko objected to the hearsay statements from Grove, King and Buennemeyer, arguing that they denied him his right to confrontation. The District Court ruled that Mizenko\u2019s cross-examination of the witnesses who had contact with Debra satisfied his Sixth Amendment right to confrontation. The jury found Mizenko guilty by a unanimous verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b324-13\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b324-14\">\u00b68 We will review a district court\u2019s evidentiary decision to determine whether it abused its discretion. <em>State v. Cameron, </em>2005 MT 32, \u00b6 14, 326 Mont. 51, \u00b6 14, 106 P.3d 1189, \u00b6 14. There is no discretion, however, in properly interpreting the Sixth Amendment. <em>See Cooper Industries, Inc. v. Leatherman Tool Group, Inc. </em>(2001), 532 U.S. 424, 456-36, 121 S.Ct. 1678, 1685-86, 149 L.Ed.2d 674, 686-87 (indicating <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>that <em>de novo </em>review is appropriate when applying a constitutional standard or concept, not capable of precise articulation, to the facts of a particular case); <em>Crawford v. Washington </em>(2004), 541 U.S. 36, 42, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 1359, 158 L.Ed.2d 177, 187 (applying <em>de novo </em>review to the Washington Supreme Court\u2019s application of the Sixth Amendment, albeit without expressly articulating any standard of review). We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law and interpretations of the Constitution or the rules of evidence, <em>de novo. State v Villanueva, </em>2005 MT 192, \u00b6 9, 328 Mont. 135, \u00b6 9, 118 P.3d 179, \u00b6 9; <em>State v. Mathis, </em>2003 MT 112, \u00b6 8, 315 Mont. 178, \u00b6 8, 68 P.3d 756, \u00b6 8; <em>see United States v. Blue Bird </em>(8th Cir. 2004), 372 F.3d 989, 991.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b325-5\">I. <em>Crawford </em>Changes the Landscape</p>\n<p id=\"b325-6\">\u00b69 \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right... to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d U.S. Const, amend. VI. Until recently, the Supreme Court had allowed courts to admit hearsay when that evidence bore \u201cadequate \u2018indicia of reliability.\u2019\u201d <em>Ohio v. Roberts </em>(1980), 448 U.S. 56, 66, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 2539, 65 L.Ed.2d 597, 608 (citation omitted). Further, \u201cReliability can be inferred without more in a case where the evidence falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception\u201d or if the evidence has \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u201d <em>Roberts, </em>448 U.S. at 66,100 S.Ct. at 2539,65 L.Ed.2d at 608. Thus, under <em>Roberts, </em>the rules of evidence subsumed any substantive restrictions the Sixth Amendment had placed on admitting hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-7\">\u00b610 In 2004 the United States Supreme Court decided <em>Crawford v. Washington </em>(2004), 541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177, in which the Court dramatically bifurcated hearsay law from the Confrontation Clause. The Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment allows courts to admit hearsay against criminal defendants in only two instances: (1) if the hearsay is testimonial, the defendant must have had an opportunity to cross-examine the declarant and the prosecution must show that the declarant is unavailable to appear at trial, <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 59, 124 S.Ct. at 1369, 158 L.Ed.2d at 197; or (2) if the hearsay is nontestimonial, the hearsay must bear adequate indicia of reliability or particularized guarantees of trustworthiness. <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 68, 124 S.Ct. at 1374, 158 L.Ed.2d at 203. In <em>Crawford, </em>although the Supreme Court gave numerous examples, it specifically declined to define what constitutes \u201ctestimonial\u201d evidence. <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 68, 124 S.Ct. at 1374, 158 L.Ed.2d at 203. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>Mizenko\u2019s case forces this Court to deal with the definitional void left by <em>Crawford.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b326-4\">II. Testimonial vs. Nontestimonial</p>\n<p id=\"b326-5\">\u00b611 Testimony is \u201c \u2018[a] solemn declaration or affirmation <em>made for the purpose </em>of establishing or proving some fact.\u2019 \u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 51, 71, 124 S.Ct. at 1364, 1375, 158 L.Ed.2d at 192, 205 (quoting 1 N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language (1828)) (emphasis added). However, \u201c[hjearsay is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d Rule 801(c), M.R.Evid. Debra\u2019s statements to Grove, King, and Buennemeyer are all clearly hearsay. As <em>Crawford </em>recognizes, though, whether the statements are testimonial is a separate issue. Unfortunately, the facts of this case do not fit neatly within <em>Crawford\u2019s </em>examples of testimonial or nontestimonial.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-6\">\u00b612 Mizenko proffers that all hearsay is testimonial if it is (1) substantive and (2) accusatorial. While appealing in its clarity and ease of application, this definition is overly broad; it would require courts to exclude more evidence than the Sixth Amendment requires. Specifically, the Supreme Court has decided that, although a statement may be substantively accusatory, the Sixth Amendment would not exclude \u201c[a]n off-hand, overheard remark,\u201d albeit accusatory, because such an off-hand remark \u201c bears little resemblance to the civil-law abuses the Confrontation Clause targeted,\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 51, 124 S.Ct. at 1364, 158 L.Ed.2d at 192.</p>\n<p id=\"b326-7\">\u00b613 In the cross-examination essential to the adversarial system, the defendant tests the witness\u2019s testimony in the most rigorous, demanding, and exacting test. <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 61, 124 S.Ct. at 1370, 158 L.Ed.2d at 199. Through cross-examination, the defendant can delve into the witness\u2019s story and potentially reveal inherent flaws, inconsistencies, and insidious motives. Indeed, John Henry Wigmore called cross-examination the \u201c\u2018greatest legal engine ever invented for the discovery of truth.\u2019\u201d <em>California v. Green </em>(1970), 399 U.S. 149, 158, 90 S.Ct. 1930, 1935, 26 L.Ed.2d 489, 497 (quoting 5 John Henry Wigmore, A Treatise on the Anglo-American System of Evidence in Trials at Common Law \u00a7 1367 (3d ed. 1940)).</p>\n<p id=\"b326-8\">\u00b614 Contrary to the holding in <em>Roberts </em>that allowed courts to decide whether testimony has \u201cadequate indicia of reliability\u201d or \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness,\u201d 448 U.S. at 66, 100 S.Ct. at 2539, 65 L.Ed.2d at 608, the Sixth Amendment itself defines the indicia of reliability and guarantees of trustworthiness necessary to admit testimonial evidence. The Sixth Amendment establishes <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>confrontation through cross-examination as the minimally adequate index of reliability and guarantee of trustworthiness. <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 61, 124 S.Ct. at 1370, 158 L.Ed.2d at 199. (\u201cIt commands, not that evidence be reliable, but that reliability be assessed in a particular manner: by testing in the crucible of cross-examination.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b327-4\">\u00b615 Testimonial evidence requires a more demanding test of reliability than non-testimonial evidence because the framers intended to protect the defendant from the evils inherent in testimonial evidence. Through example, <em>Crawford </em>highlights one particular evil: \u201cFirst, the principal evil at which the Confrontation Clause was directed was the civil-law mode of criminal procedure, and particularly its use of <em>ex parte </em>examinations as evidence against the accused.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 50,124 S.Ct. at 1363, 158 L.Ed.2d at 192. <em>Crawford </em>elaborates on the two concerns engendered by this evidence. The first is the concern with possible prosecutorial misconduct and overzealousness:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-5\">The Framers would be astounded to learn that <em>ex parte </em>testimony could be admitted against a criminal defendant because it was elicited by \u201cneutral\u201d government officers. But even if the court\u2019s assessment of the officer\u2019s motives was accurate, it says nothing about Sylvia\u2019s perception of her situation. Only cross-examination could reveal that.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-6\"><em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 66, 124 S.Ct. at 1373, 158 L.Ed.2d at 202. In identifying the possible purposes behind the protections afforded by the Confrontation Clause, Professor Mosteller notes that this concern may manifest in either of two ways: \u201cgovernment[al] manipulation of the witness in creating the evidence-manipulating the words uttered\u201d; or \u201cgovernmental manipulation of the recording of the statement rather than manipulation of what was said.\u201d Robert P. Mosteller, <em>Crawford v. Washington: </em>Encouraging and Ensuring the Confrontation of Witnesses, 39 U. Rich. L. Rev. 511, 569-70 (2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b327-7\">\u00b616 The second concern is with the declarant\u2019s opportunity to abuse the criminal justice system in order to punish, to exact revenge on, or to shift the blame to the defendant.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial of Sir Walter Raleigh, as quoted in <em>Crawford, </em>illustrates this danger:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-8\">Lord Cobham, Raleigh\u2019s alleged accomplice, had implicated him in an examination before the Privy Council and in a letter. At Raleigh\u2019s trial, these were read to the jury. Raleigh argued that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>Cobham had lied to save himself: \u201cCobham is absolutely in the King\u2019s mercy; to excuse me cannot avail him; by accusing me he may hope for favour.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-4\"><em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 44, 124 S.Ct. at 1360, 158 L.Ed.2d at 188 (quoting 1D. Jardine, Criminal Trials 435 (1832)). As the Sixth Circuit has noted, cross-examination is essential to expose possible bias or motive of the declarant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-5\">Indeed, the danger to a defendant might well be greater if the statement introduced at trial, without a right of confrontation, is a statement volunteered to police rather than a statement elicited through formalized police interrogation. One can imagine the temptation that someone who bears a grudge might have to volunteer to police, truthfully or not, information of the commission of a crime, especially when that person is assured he will not be subject to confrontation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-6\"><em>United States v. Cromer </em>(6th Cir. 2004), 389 F.3d 662, 675.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-7\">\u00b617 <em>Crawford </em>characterizes \u201ca casual remark to an acquaintance\u201d as nontestimonial. <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 51, 124 S.Ct. at 1364, 158 L.Ed.2d at 192. The word \u201ccasual,\u201d rather than modifying the setting in which the declarant made the statement, modifies the declarant\u2019s assumption as to what use, if any, the listener might make of the statement. When an objective declarant would reasonably expect the state to use her statements at trial, the Sixth Amendment demands that courts exclude such statements absent an opportunity for confrontation. <em>United States v. Saget </em>(2nd Cir. 2004), 377 F.3d 223, 228-29; <em>Horton v. Allen </em>(1st Cir. 2004), 370 F.3d 75, 84.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-8\">\u00b618 When speaking to government agents or officials, the circumstances are such that a declarant should reasonably expect that the government will seek to use those statements at trial. Whereas when a declarant speaks with her neighbor across the backyard fence, she has much less of an expectation that the government will make prosecutorial use of those statements. Any situation in which the declarant is knowingly speaking to the police or government agents implicates concerns both with the declarant\u2019s motivation and with the possibility of prosecutorial misconduct. The declarant expects and understands that the government may use her statements at trial, and the police may deliberately or inadvertently color the substance of their statements to reflect their own prejudices and understandings of the situation, or may selectively record the declarant\u2019s statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-9\">\u00b619 Likewise, when the declarant signs an affidavit or gives a recorded statement, the declarant expects that the state will seek to make use of those statements. <em>See White v. Illinois </em>(1992), 502 U.S. 346, 365, 112 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>S.Ct. 736, 747, 116 L.Ed.2d 848, 865 (Thomas, J., joined by Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment). Although the government may not be directly involved in obtaining recorded or sworn testimony, a declarant who provides such testimony clearly anticipates that the state may use the statements against an accused. <em>See White, </em>502 U.S. at 365, 112 S.Ct. at 747, 116 L.Ed.2d at 865 (\u201cextrajudicial statements ... contained in formalized testimonial materials, such as affidavits, depositions, prior testimony, or confessions,\u201d implicate the Confrontation Clause) (Thomas, J., joined by Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment) (quoted in <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 51-52,124 S.Ct. at 1364,158 L.Ed.2d at 193 (ellipses in quotation)); <em>see also </em>Richard D. Friedman, The Confrontation Clause Re-Rooted and Transformed, 2004 Cato Sup. Ct. Rev. 439, 458 (\u201cThus, if just before trial a person shoved a written statement under the courthouse door, asserting that the accused did in fact commit the crime, that would plainly be testimonial even though no government official played a role in preparing the statement.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">\u00b620  A declarant who is alerting law enforcement of imminent and immediate danger has much less of an expectation that the state will seek to make prosecutorial use of her statements at trial. <em>United States v. Brun </em>(8th Cir. 2005), 416 F.3d 703 (911 call from adolescent boy regarding an argument escalating into an assault); <em>see People v. Moscat </em>(N.Y. Crim. Ct. 2004), 3 Misc.3d 739, 746 (deciding that a 911 call \u201cis the electronically augmented equivalent of a loud cry for help\u201d); <em>Leavitt v. Arave </em>(9th Cir. 2004), 383 F.3d 809, 830 n.22 (determining that statements to police by a victim of an attempted break-in identifying the perpetrator are nontestimonial because they were volunteered in order to end \u201ca frightening intrusion into her home\u201d); <em>People v. Coleman </em>(N.Y. App. Div. 2005), 16 A.D.3d 254, 255 (\u201c[t]he information conveyed by the 911 caller was for the purpose of urgently seeking police intervention\u201d; \u201cwe note that the caller repeatedly emphasized that one or both of the victims was \u2018bleeding real bad.\u2019 This indicates that his primary motivation was to call for urgent assistance, and not to phone in an anonymous accusation\u201d). Whether a reasonable declarant would expect statements made during a call to 911 to be used prosecutorially will depend on the content of the conversation and the particular circumstances that led to the call being placed.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">\u00b621 We do not assume that a declarant speaking to her neighbor across the backyard fence reasonably expects that the government will seek to use her statements as testimony. For most people, none of their \u201ccasual\u201d remarks ever surface in court. Seldom do people make such \u201ccasual remark[s],\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 51, 124 S.Ct. at 1364, 158 L.Ed.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>192, with \u201cany anticipation by the speaker that the statement will be conveyed beyond the immediate audience, let alone that it will be used at trial,\u201d Mosteller, 39 U. Rich. L. Rev. at 573. In <em>United States v. Franklin </em>(6th Cir. 2005), 415 F.3d 537, the court held that where a declarant Clarke\u2019s statements were to a friend, Wright, they were nontestimonial. \u201cClarke made the statements to his friend by happenstance; Wright was not a police officer or a government informant seeking to elicit the statements to further a prosecution against Clarke or Frankin. To the contrary, Wright was privy to Clarke\u2019s statements only as his friend and confidant.\u201d <em>Franklin, </em>415 F.3d at 545; <em>United States v. Gibson </em>(6th Cir. 2005), 409 F.3d 325, 338 (describing statements as nontestimonial where the \u201cstatements were not made to the police or in the course of an official investigation... [nor in an attempt] to curry favor or shift the blame\u201d); <em>United States v. Manfre </em>(8th Cir. 2004), 368 F.3d 832, 838 n.1 (\u201cMr. Rush\u2019s comments were made to loved ones or acquaintances and are not the kind of memorialized, judicial-process-created evidence of which <em>Crawford </em>speaks\u201d); <em>United States v. Lee </em>(8th Cir. 2004), 374 F.3d 637, 645 (\u201cKehoe\u2019s statements to his mother do not implicate the core concerns of the confrontation clause\u201d). Likewise, many state courts have been less apt to conclude that statements made to personal acquaintances are testimonial. <em>See, e.g., People v. Cervantes </em>(Cal. Ct. App. 2004), 12 Cal.Rptr.3d 774, 777, 782-83 (deciding that statements made to a neighbor from whom the declarant sought medical assistance, which described a murder and implicated the declarant and others, were not testimonial under any of the formulations provided in <em>Crawford)-, State v. Rivera </em>(Conn. 2004), 844 A.2d 191, 201-02 (determining that a statement made to the declarant\u2019s nephew describing a botched robbery-turned-murder undertaken by the declarant and an accomplice was nontestimonial); <em>Demons v. State </em>(Ga. 2004), 595 S.E.2d 76, 78-80 (holding that a statement made to the declarant\u2019s co-worker indicating that the declarant\u2019s bruises came from beatings inflicted by his domestic partner whom he feared would kill him was nontestimonial).</p>\n<p id=\"AKl\">\u00b622 In <em>State v. Carter, </em>2005 MT 87, 326 Mont. 427, 114 P.3d 1001, we held that the weekly field certification reports that the state introduced to show that the Intoxilizer 5000 was functioning properly when it was administered by the police, were nontestimonial. We reasoned that the reports were \u201cnot substantive evidence of a particular offense, but rather are foundational evidence necessary for the admission of substantive evidence. In other words, the certification reports are nontestimonial in nature in that they are foundational, rather than substantive or accusatory.\u201d <em>Carter, </em>\u00b6 32 (internal citation omitted). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>Sixth Amendment, itself, extends only to \u201cwitnesses against\u201d the defendant, and hearsay provided for foundational purposes is not evidence \u201cagainst\u201d the defendant. Thus, while the author of the certification reports could reasonably anticipate that the reports would be used in or by a court, those reports, because \u201cnot substantive evidence of a particular offense,\u201d were held to be nontestimonial. <em>See Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 56, 124 S.Ct. at 1367, 158 L.Ed.2d at 195-96 (business records are nontestimonial); <em>United States v. Cervantes-Flores </em>(9th Cir. 2005), 421 F.3d 825, 831-34 (immigration records nontestimonial); <em>United States v. Garner </em>(6th Cir. 2005), 2005 WL 2175907 (unpublished) (medical records nontestimonial).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-4\">\u00b623  Bringing together these rationales, generally, when a declarant knowingly speaks to a police officer or governmental agent, her statements are presumed testimonial. If, however, the declarant had objective reason to believe that her statement would serve only to avert or mitigate an imminent or immediate danger and the agent who received the statement had no intent to create evidence, the statement is presumed to be nontestimonial. Alternatively, unless the declarant had clear reason to believe that the statement would be used in court as substantive evidence against the defendant, her statements to a nongovernmental agent are nontestimonial.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">HI. Debra Mizenko\u2019s Statements at Issue</p>\n<p id=\"Aef\">\u00b624 Mizenko\u2019s appeal presents three instances of statements by Debra Mizenko, who did not appear at trial and whom Mizenko was unable to cross-examine: (1) Debra\u2019s statements to her neighbor Dawn Grove, (2) Debra\u2019s statements to 911 dispatcher Tami King, and (3) Debra\u2019s statements to Deputy Buennemeyer.</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">\u00b625 Mizenko argues that the court erred in allowing Dawn Grove to testify that Debra told her that Mizenko had been drinking and was trying to hurt her; in allowing the police dispatcher Tami King to testify as to the contents of the 911 tape, in particular that Mizenko had pushed Debra down, hit her and pulled her hair out; and in allowing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>Deputy Buennemeyer to testify that Debra told him that the hair on the floor was hers and had been pulled out during the altercation with Mizenko.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-4\">\u00b626  In discussing these issues, it must be noted that the State, through witness King, offered the 911 taped conversation as evidence. Since King stated that she had not listened to the tape and could not verify its accuracy, Mizenko objected for lack of foundation. The court sustained the objection. During a break, King listened to the tape and was subsequently able to testify that it was an accurate representation of the conversation. The tape was then admitted without objection and was played for the jury. During the taped conversation, Debra told King that Mizenko had hit her, pushed her down, and pulled out her hair. Since Debra\u2019s taped statements that Mizenko had pulled out her hair were admitted without objection, King\u2019s and Buennemeyer\u2019s testimony concerning the hair pulling, even if objectionable, was cumulative and, thus, harmless error. <em>State v. Van Kirk, </em>2001 MT 184, \u00b6 43, 306 Mont. 215, \u00b6 43, 32 P.3d 735, \u00b6 43. Likewise, King\u2019s statements that Mizenko had pushed Debra down and hit her constitute harmless error, at most. \u00b627 [4] As to witness Dawn Grove, she was Debra\u2019s neighbor. Debra appeared at Dawn\u2019s house late one afternoon, out of breath and bruised on the cheek. She was seeking assistance after having been beaten by her husband. Given that she was in distress and addressing a nongovernmental agent, her neighbor, she had no objective reason to believe or anticipate that her statement would be used in court. <em>See </em>Mosteller, 39 U. Rich. L. Rev. at 573 (indicating that \u201cmost private statements, even if accusatory, are not candidates for being considered testimonial\u201d). The most reasonable construction of Debra\u2019s statement to Grove is that Debra merely endeavored to provide Grove with a context that would explain Debra\u2019s sudden appearance, with dog in tow and a freshly bruised face, on her neighbor\u2019s doorstep. Her utterance also enabled Debra to share the burden of a traumatic beating, a need evidenced by the fact that she sought the immediate solace that her neighbor could provide as well as her desire to phone her friend Carol Richard. To the extent that the statement can be construed in any other manner, it is fairly characterized as primarily a cry for help. Debra, having fled her own home where her husband had just beaten her, sought sanctuary from which to take her next step. Significantly, Debra apparently did not feel sufficiently secure in her own home to remain there and phone either her friend Carol Richard or 911. In light of the abuse she suffered and the very real possibility that Mizenko would return and continue the assault, her fear of remaining in her home was well founded. Debra\u2019s cursory explanation of the circumstances that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>prompted her to request Grove\u2019s assistance, though evidence, were not created by the judicial process. Debra lacked reason to believe that her statement would be used prosecutorially as substantive evidence against Mizenko. If she had anticipated such use, in all likelihood, she would have divulged greater detail, as she later did when speaking with 911 operator King, and indicated that her husband <em>had in fact hurt her, </em>not merely that he was trying to hurt her. Accordingly, her statement to Grove was nontestimonial and the admission of Dawn Grove\u2019s hearsay testimony did not offend the confrontation clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">\u00b628 Ruling on the admissibility of statements made in a remarkably similar situation, the Colorado Supreme Court recently rendered a decision that mirrors our conclusion that Debra\u2019s statement to Grove was not testimonial. In <em>Compan v. People </em>(Colo. 2005), 121 P.3d 876, the Colorado Court unanimously<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> affirmed the admission of hearsay statements made by a woman shortly after suffering abuse at the hands of her husband and describing that abuse in detail. During a heated argument with her husband, the victim, while crying, had called her friend Vargas and asked her to come pick her up. <em>Compan, </em>121 P.3d at 877. About twenty minutes later, the victim, now \u201csubdued, very quiet and sad\u201d again called Vargas, reported that her husband had already hit her, and again requested a ride. <em>Compan, </em>121 P.3d at 877. Another fifteen minutes elapsed before Vargas arrived to whisk the victim away to the secure environs of Vargas\u2019s home. During the ride, the victim, who was biting her nails, shaking and crying, explained that her husband had kicked and punched her stomach, \u201cslapped her, pulled her hair, and thr[own] her against a wall.\u201d <em>Compan, </em>121 P.3d at 878. When they arrived at Vargas\u2019s house, the victim continued recounting the assault and eventually asked Vargas to call the police. The victim did not testify at trial.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Compan, </em>121 P.3d at 878. The Colorado Court considered each of the three formulations of \u201ctestimonial\u201d postulated by the <em>Crawford </em>Court and unanimously concluded that the victim\u2019s excited utterances to Vargas did not fall within any of them. <em>See Compan, </em>121 P.3d at 880-81 (\u201cthe victim\u2019s statements were not made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial. Rather, the victim was speaking informally to her friend\u201d); <em>see also Mosteller, </em>39 U. Rich. L. Rev. at 544 (indicating that under his proposed method for ascertaining whether a statement is testimonial, \u201cthe statements in <em>Compan </em>and similar fact patterns would not be considered testimonial\u201d). Furthermore, the Colorado Court concluded that \u201cthe constitutionality of nontestimonial statements is controlled by the federal confrontation clause as set forth in <em>Roberts.\u201d Compan, </em>121 P.3d at 881 (citing a litany of cases from federal circuit courts and state supreme courts that have reached the same conclusion).</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">\u00b629 As to the dissent, Justice Nelson is jousting with windmills of his own making. He relies on Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution, a theory which he admits was not argued by the defendant, and he focuses on the testimony of 911 operator King and Officer Buennemeyer without acknowledging that their testimony, if objectionable, was cumulative since the 911 tape itself was admitted without objection.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The dissent proffers a tortured interpretation of this opinion by insinuating that the Court\u2019s definition of \u201ctestimonial\u201d encompasses only statements made to government agents. Contrary to the dissent\u2019s mischaracterization, the Court has afforded the defendant <em>greater </em>protection from statements made to a government agent, by presuming that such statements are testimonial.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Although the Supreme Court identified three of the \u201c[vjarious formulations of ... \u2018testimonial\u2019 statements [that] exist,\u201d it explicitly \u201c[left] for another day <em>any effort </em>to spell out a comprehensive definition of \u2018testimonial.\u2019\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 51, 68, 124 S.Ct. at 1364, 1374, 157 L.Ed.2d at 193, 203 (emphasis added). Justice Nelson\u2019s painstaking efforts in \u201cformulating\u201d a comprehensive definition of \u201ctestimonial\u201d has led him to simply adopt the formulation proffered to the Court by the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers-the broadest of the extant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>formulations acknowledged by Crawford-despite the Court\u2019s tacit warning against doing so. Finally, Justice Nelson quotes from the Victim Impact Statement submitted by Debra after Mizenko had been tried and convicted. This statement, however, was not submitted until after trial, and has <em>no </em>evidentiary value as to the propriety of admitting Debra\u2019s various statements, nor as to Mizenko\u2019s guilt. Moreover, the Victim Impact Statement, though rhetorically resonant, suffers from the flaws that Justice Nelson decries in the hearsay testimony that was admitted-lack of oath, inability to cross-examine and inability to assess credibility-provides Debra ample opportunity for reflection and fabrication, and represents a premeditated, conscientious attempt to provide testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b335-4\">\u00b630  Many state courts have considered whether a statement made by the victim of a crime to a friend, family member or acquaintance and describing the crime, identifying the perpetrator or both, is testimonial. Despite Justice Nelson\u2019s disagreement, extant authority supports the Court\u2019s position that such statements, even if made to a loose acquaintance, are nontestimonial unless the declarant had clear reason to believe that they will be used prosecutorially. <em>See, </em>e.g., <em>Salt Lake City v. Williams </em>(Utah Ct. App. 2005), 2005 UT App 493, \u00b6 24 (statements by the deceased victim to a friend identifying the perpetrator by name and indicating that he had threatened to kill her held nontestimonial because they were issued \u201cwith no reasonable expectation that it would be used in a later legal proceeding\u201d); <em>State v.

After an exhaustive review of cases applying <em>Crawford, </em>we could find only two instances when a court held that a victim\u2019s statement to a private individual is testimonial. <em>See In re E.H. </em>(Ill. Ct. App. 2005), 823 N.E.2d 1029, 1037 (statements, made by child victim of sexual assault to her grandmother, describing the sexual abuse perpetrated by defendant held testimonial because the statements concern \u201cthe fault and identity\u201d of the perpetrator); <em>In re T.T. </em>(Ill.

App. 2004), 815 N.E.2d 789, 804 (statements made by victim of sexual assault to a treating physician that explain how she was physically injured and the pain she experienced held nontestimonial; however, her statements identifying the defendant as the perpetrator held testimonial).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\">\u00b631 The dissent, in arguing that <em>Crawford </em>has eradicated the excited utterance exception to hearsay in criminal cases, paints with too broad a brush. Although <em>Crawford </em>does disallow the use of hearsay exceptions based on indicia of reliability as the basis to admit hearsay statements, it does so only in the context of testimonial statements which violate the Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses. <em>Crawford </em>does not expressly or impliedly supersede the rules of evidence as they relate to nontestimonial evidence. <em>See Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 68, 124 S.Ct. at 1374, 158 L.Ed.2d at 203 (\u201c[wjhere nontestimonial hearsay is at issue, it is wholly consistent with the Framers\u2019 design to afford the States flexibility in their development of hearsay law-as does <em>Roberts, </em>and as would an approach that exempted such statements from Confrontation Clause scrutiny altogether\u201d). In the wake of <em>Crawford, </em>nontestimonial hearsay is analyzed pursuant to the <em>Roberts </em>reliability standard, or simply to ensure compliance with the rules of evidence. <em>See </em>Mosteller, 39 U. Rich. L. Rev. at 617, 619 (\u201c[presently, lower courts should still apply the \u2018old system\u2019 to non-testimonial hearsay because <em>Crawford </em>did not overrule <em>Roberts </em>in this area\u201d); <em>see also Agostini v. Felton </em>(1997), 521 U.S. 203, 237, 117 S.Ct. 1997, 138 L.E.2d 391, 423 (quoting <em>Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/Am. Express, Inc. </em>(1989), 490 U.S. 477, 484,109 S.Ct. 1917, 1921-22, 104 L.E.2d 526) (\u2018\u201c[i]f a precedent of this Court has direct application in a case, yet appears to rest on reasons rejected in some other line of decisions, the Court of Appeals should follow the case which directly controls, leaving to this Court the prerogative of overruling its own decisions\u2019\u201d). Rather than divine the dramatic and unexpressed implications of <em>Crawford, </em>we will afford the Supreme Court the first opportunity to expressly overrule <em>Roberts </em>and to invalidate the Federal Rules of Evidence pertaining to hearsay in criminal cases, as is their express preference.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>\u00b632 As the Sixth Circuit has recognized, <em>Crawford </em>dealt only with testimonial statements and did not disturb the rule that nontestimonial statements are constitutionally admissible if they fit within a firmly rooted hearsay exception or they bear independent guarantees of trustworthiness. <em>Gibson, </em>409 F.3d at 338.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-4\">\u00b633  We thus turn to the question of whether Debra\u2019s statement fits within a firmly rooted exception to the hearsay rule. Rule 803, M.R.Evid. (Availability of declarant immaterial), enumerates the exceptions to the hearsay rule in Montana. Subsection 2 of the Rule sets forth the \u201cexcited utterance\u201d exception. In <em>Matter of S.M., </em>2001 MT 11, 304 Mont. 102, 19 P.3d 213, a child had seen her mother\u2019s abusive boyfriend outside of a building and subsequently told a social worker that she was frightened. <em>Matter of S.M., </em>\u00b6 19. We found that the social worker\u2019s testimony relaying the child\u2019s statement was properly admitted as an excited utterance relating to the startling event of seeing her abuser. <em>Matter of S.M., </em>\u00b6 24. We noted that the social worker observed the child tightly grasping her foster mother\u2019s arm \u201cwith a very frightened look in her eyes.\u201d <em>Matter </em>of S.M., \u00b6 20. Presumably, we relied on this observation of the child\u2019s appearance to support our unstated conclusion that the child remained \u201cunder the stress of excitement\u201d when she expressed her fear. In <em>State v. Hamby, </em>1999 MT 319, 297 Mont. 274, 992 P.2d 1266, we concluded that hearsay statements were properly admitted under the excited utterance exception because \u201c[t]he record does not suggest that [the victim\u2019s] distress subsided once Betty asked her questions, even when they were in the bathroom.\u201d <em>Hamby, </em>\u00b6 29; <em>see also State v. Graves </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 451, 454, 458-59, 901 P.2d 549, 551, 554-55 (indicating that a rape victim\u2019s statements to an anonymous 911 caller made \u201cshortly after defendant left\u201d her home and while she was still crying qualified as an excited utterance); <em>State v. Cameron, </em>2005 MT 32, 326 Mont. 51, 106 P.3d 1189 (holding that a victim\u2019s sobbing statement to her sister related to a sexual assault that had occurred one or two hours earlier was an excited utterance under Rule 803(2), M.R.Evid.). It is clear from the cases cited above that a declarant\u2019s appearance and demeanor can indicate that the declarant remains under the stress of excitement caused by a startling event and a lapse of time is not determinative of whether that stress has subsided.</p>\n<p id=\"ANo\">\u00b634  In the present case, Debra\u2019s statements to Grove were made a short time after the assault while she was out of breath, visibly upset and had a fresh wound on her face. Since Debra\u2019s statements, made while she was still under stress caused by the event, clearly fall within the firmly rooted excited utterance exception to hearsay under Rule 803(2), M.R.Evid., the court did not err in admitting them.</p>\n<p id=\"b339-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>\u00b635 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b339-4\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES WARNER, MORRIS and RICE.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b323-15\"> If testimonial, we would consider whether the State made a showing that Debra was unavailable at trial and that Mizenko had an opportunity to cross-examine Debra at the time she made the statements, as required to overcome a Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause objection.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b327-9\"> Professor Mosteller similarly identifies the other possible purpose of the Confrontation Clause as \u201cprotect[ing] the defendant from malicious falsehoods or even errors by the witness independent of governmental manipulation.\u201d Mosteller, 39 U.

[Click.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b340-4\">\u00b637 This colloquy is, of course, the counter-point to the thoughtful dissent with which I must disagree.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The dissent\u2019s historical analysis of the right of a defendant in a criminal case is instructive, and points to problems that must be faced in modern criminal prosecutions. In my view, however, it ignores the interests of the victim; takes too cynical, and dangerous, of an approach to our system of criminal justice; and misinterprets <em>Crawford.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b340-5\">\u00b638 The dissent fails to give sufficient consideration to the interests of witnesses and victims. The Court recognizes the critical importance of the Confrontation Clause. However, as the dialogue I have presented above illustrates, an accused must not be allowed to hide behind the Constitution by intimidating witnesses. It would be naive to assume that defendants would not do so, if given the opportunity. It takes little imagination to picture the jungle of fear that would be created if the rationale that is proposed by the dissent is adopted. In my view it would become intolerably more dangerous to be the victim of an offense, or to be a witness in any criminal case, if the Confrontation Clause is interpreted to mean that prosecutions cannot be maintained if witnesses, for whatever reason, do not appear at trial, which is what the dissent seems to advocate.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em>Tom Lininger, <em>Prosecuting Batterers After </em>Crawford, 91 Va. L. Rev. 747, 750 (2005) (65% of prosecutors surveyed in California, Oregon, and Washington \u201creported that victims of domestic violence are less safe in their jurisdictions than during the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>era preceding the <em>Crawford </em>decision.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b341-4\">\u00b639 I also disagree with the dissent\u2019s premise that government officers will run amok in their zeal to unfairly obtain convictions. In our justice system, prosecuting attorneys, and impliedly all law enforcement personnel, occupy a position of public trust. Courts, citizens and even criminal defendants must rely on these public servants to be honorable advocates both for the community on whose behalf they litigate and for the justice system of which they are an integral part.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">\u00b640 It cannot be gainsaid that it is possible for unscrupulous prosecutors or other government officials to cheat, connive, and abuse the system to unfairly obtain a conviction. Indeed, it was the intent of the Framers to limit the discretion of these individuals. <em>See Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 67, 124 S.Ct. at 1373, 158 L.Ed. at 202-203. However, I do not presume, as the dissent seems to, that prosecutors inevitably abuse their offices, violate their oaths to uphold the Constitution, and connive to manufacture evidence so that a complaining witness need not appear at trial. Such general accusations undermine public confidence and bring into question our entire system of justice. There are implicit checks on prosecutors and government officials imposed by the elective system, the legislature, the bar, and the courts. Such is evident in this Court\u2019s decision today, providing protection for defendants against testimonial hearsay.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">\u00b641 It is clear that only those out of court statements that are testimonial in nature are the \u201cprimary objective\u201d of the Confrontation Clause. <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 53,124 S.Ct. at 1365, 158 L.Ed. at 194. Until the Supreme Court expressly rules otherwise, we should continue to apply the precedent left in place. Robert P. Mosteller, Crawford v. Washington: <em>Encouraging and Ensuring the Confrontation of Witnesses, </em>39 U. Rich. L. Rev. 511, 619 (2005) (\u201clower courts should still apply the \u2018old system\u2019 to non-testimonial hearsay because <em>Crawford </em>did not overrule <em>Roberts </em>in this area.\u201d). As Professor Friedman, whose scholarly work influenced the <em>Crawford </em>majority, notes, \u201c[I]f the statement is not testimonial, so that the declarant should not be deemed to have been acting as a witness in making it, the [Confrontation] Clause should not bar its admissibility, even if the statement does not seem reliable.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> No matter how the dissent spins the language of <em>Crawford, </em>the decision does not broaden Confrontation Clause scrutiny to encompass nontestimonial statements. Thus the dissent is incorrect to go as far as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>to assume \u201cthat the right of confrontation applies to both testimonial and nontestimonial statements[,]\u201d and that the <em>Roberts </em>analysis has been rendered inapplicable. Nontestimonial statements should be admitted under the <em>Roberts </em>standard, which is most often met by a \u201cfirmly rooted\u201d hearsay exception.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The rules of evidence, properly interpreted, provide sufficient guarantees of fairness. Contrary to the dissent\u2019s assertion, firmly rooted exceptions, like that for excited utterances, are still valid law.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-4\">\u00b642 Prosecutors are still required to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt. The difficulty of gaining a conviction increases significantly where the prosecution\u2019s case relies primarily upon out of court statements. Experience shows that jurors simply give less weight to hearsay. John G. Douglass, <em>Confronting the Reluctant Accomplice, </em>101 Colum. L. Rev. 1797, 1839, n.180 (2001) (\u201c[J]urors exposed to hearsay will know that they are receiving secondhand goods.\u201d); Richard F. Rakos &amp; Stephan Landsman, <em>Researching the Hearsay Rule: Emerging Findings, General Issues, and Future Directions, </em>76 Minn. L.

Conversely, the dissent\u2019s objective of protecting the accused to the utmost extent, while perhaps well intentioned, fails to adequately consider how such an interpretation of the Confrontation Clause would impede our pursuit of truth and justice in an imperfect world.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b340-6\"> The foregoing dialogue is not fanciful. Some research has shown that approximately 80% of victims decline to assist the government in prosecutions of domestic violence cases. Tom Lininger, <em>Prosecuting Batterers After </em>Crawford, 91 Va. L. Rev. 747, 768-769 (2005) (\u201cThe reasons why victims refuse to cooperate with the prosecution are manifold, but chief among them is the risk of reprisals by the batterers. One study found that batterers threaten retaliatory violence in as many as half of all cases, and 30 percent of batterers actually assault their victims again during the predisposition phase of prosecution.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b340-7\"> As a potential safeguard the <em>Crawford </em>majority noted the rule of forfeiture by wrongdoing. <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 62, 124 S.Ct. at 1370, 158 L.Ed. at 199. This was codified in FRE 804(b)(6), which admits hearsay \u201coffered against a party that has engaged or acquiesced in wrongdoing that was intended to, and did, procure the unavailability of the witness.\u201d Application of Rule 804(b)(6) is complicated. <em>See U.S. v. Dhinsa </em>(2nd Cir. 2001), 243 F.3d 635,653-654. It has been adopted by only a few states, and has not been adopted in Montana. However, because <em>Crawford </em>has heightened the importance of five testimony, and therefore increased the probability that the accused will threaten potential witnesses, FRE 804(b)(6) may now see increased application in the federal courts, with respect to testimonial hearsay.

As such, there will be no compelling reason for victims of Partner or Family Member Assault to testify at the trials of their alleged abusers. In fact, if the theory of this case is followed to its logical conclusion, there likewise will be no reason for victims of rape, sexual assault, robbery, assault, attempted homicide or, for that matter, any crime involving \u201cemotional and/or physical abuse perpetrated by an individual exerting power and control over another individual,\u201d Brief of Amicus Curiae Montana Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence at 3 n.l, to testify either. Subpoenas of victims will not be worth the paper they are written on.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-4\">\u00b647 Even worse, and under the same circumstances, there will no longer be a compelling reason for the State to even subpoena the victim. Why put up with the risk of recanted and equivocal testimony?<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Why <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>subject the victim to the additional trauma of having to confront the alleged perpetrator face to face and deal with his or her attorney\u2019s cross-examination? Why put the victim at risk of contempt if he or she \u201crefuse[s] to participate in prosecution efforts\u201d or \u201cchoose[s] not to participate in the prosecution,\u201d Brief of Amicus Curiae Montana Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence at 3? Better to simply shift the burden of proof to the accused-allow the State to introduce the victim\u2019s out-of-court statements and force the defendant to subpoena the victim in order to prove his innocence. If the victim refuses or chooses not to show up for the trial, so what? The State\u2019s case is secure.</p>\n<p id=\"AAyV\">\u00b648 And the threat of contempt?<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Even if the prosecutor pushes the issue and even if the District Judge is willing to make the non-testifying-victim a martyr by holding her or him in contempt, most victims still will be more than happy to take a tongue-lashing from the court and pay a small fine than testify, especially since doing so is now an option as a practical matter. Indeed, I expect that most <em>abusers </em>will be more than happy to pay the fine if doing so keeps their accusers off the witness stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-4\">\u00b649 The majority opinion misinterprets and, thus, misapplies the right of confrontation. The hearsay evidence admitted in Mizenko\u2019s trial, over his objection, consisted of statements by his wife Debra to three persons: Dawn Grove (\u201cGrove\u201d), Mizenko and Debra\u2019s neighbor; Tami King (\u201cKing\u201d), the 911 operator; and Deputy Buennemeyer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>(\u201cBuennemeyer\u201d), the investigating officer. Mizenko never had an opportunity to cross-examine these statements. Thus, by affirming the District Court\u2019s admission of this hearsay testimony, the majority perpetuates the District Court\u2019s denial of Mizenko\u2019s fundamental right \u201cto be confronted with the witnesses against him,\u201d as guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment of the United States Constitution, and his even greater fundamental right \u201cto meet the witnesses against him <em>face to face\u201d </em>under Article II, Section 24, of Montana\u2019s Constitution (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-4\">I. Approach</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">\u00b650 The majority opinion is grounded in the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Crawford v. Washington </em>(2004), 541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177, which effected a sea change in Sixth Amendment jurisprudence.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> However, the majority has misapplied the core holdings of the <em>Crawford </em>decision and, in \u00bfso doing, has severely diminished the confrontation and cross-examination rights of persons accused of crimes in this state. That this should happen in Montana is especially tragic.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">\u00b651 <em>Crawford </em>may be analyzed from two perspectives, both of which I cover in this opinion. First, I begin with an analysis of what constitutes a \u201ctestimonial\u201d statement, focusing on the meaning of that term as set forth in <em>Crawford </em>and the authorities to which it cites. During this discussion, I also address the majority\u2019s (mis)interpretation of the Confrontation Clause and, in particular, its erroneous definition of \u201ctestimonial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">\u00b652 I next apply to the facts of the case <em>sub judice </em>a definition of \u201ctestimonial\u201d that is faithful to both <em>Crawford </em>and the Confrontation Clause as conceived by the Framers. If the hearsay evidence at issue here is \u201ctestimonial\u201d under this definition-and I conclude that.it is-then its use at Mizenko\u2019s trial was categorically barred unless Debra was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>\u201cunavailable\u201d to testify <em>and </em>Mizenko had a prior opportunity to cross-examine her.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-4\">\u00b653 Thus, because I disagree with the majority\u2019s determination that the hearsay statements admitted at trial were nontestimonial, I then address whether Debra was \u201cunavailable\u201d to testify and whether Mizenko had a prior opportunity to cross-examine her. With respect to the former requirement, the District Court (1) failed in its obligation to hold the State to its burden to prove Debra was unavailable (in the legal sense) and (2) failed to specifically rule on the question of unavailability. Thus, Debra was not \u201cunavailable.\u201d With respect to the latter requirement, there is no dispute that Mizenko did not at any time have an opportunity to cross-examine Debra. Accordingly, I conclude that neither requirement was met and that the District Court, therefore, erred in admitting Debra\u2019s statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">\u00b654 Finally, I take up the second perspective from which <em>Crawford </em>may be analyzed, focusing on the Supreme Court\u2019s rejection of the reliability and trustworthiness framework of <em>Ohio v. Roberts </em>(1980), 448 U.S. 56, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 65 L.Ed.2d 597, and, in particular, the Court\u2019s rejection of the very rationales upon which it had relied in <em>White v. Illinois </em>(1992), 502 U.S. 346, 112 S.Ct. 736, 116 L.Ed.2d 848, in upholding the admission of hearsay testimony as an excited utterance. I conclude that the admission of hearsay statements based on the excited utterance exception is no longer permitted unless the declarant is \u201cunavailable\u201d and there was a prior opportunity for the accused to cross-examine the declarant.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-6\">II. The Right to Confront</p>\n<p id=\"b348-7\">\u00b655 <em>There are few subjects ... upon which this Court and other courts have been more nearly unanimous than in their expressions ofbeliefthat the right of confrontation and cross-examination is an essential and fundamental requirement for the kind of fair trial which is this country\u2019s constitutional goal. Pointer v. Texas </em>(1965), 380 U.S. 400, 405, 85 S.Ct. 1065, 1068, 13 L.Ed.2d 923.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-8\">\u00b656 <em>Crawford </em>breathes new life into the admonition of <em>Pointer. </em>Before turning to <em>Crawford, </em>however, it is critical to first acknowledge that Article II, Section 24, of Montana\u2019s Constitution guarantees persons accused of crimes even greater rights of confrontation and cross-examination than does the Federal Constitution. It is very unfortunate that the defense did not recognize this fact and pursue a claim under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>Article II, Section 24.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Nonetheless, given that the right of confrontation is a fundamental right, I will address this right under the Montana Constitution, after which I will proceed with my discussion of <em>Crawford.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b349-4\">A. The Right of Confrontation in Montana</p>\n<p id=\"ARS\">\u00b657 In pertinent part, Article II, Section 24, provides that \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions the accused shall have the right... to meet the witnesses against him <em>face to face.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) <em>In State v. Clark, </em>1998 MT 221, 290 Mont. 479, 964 P.2d 766, we interpreted this guarantee and held that the admission of a state crime lab report under the public records and reports hearsay exception, <em>see </em>Rule 803(8), M.R.Evid., without requiring the presence of the technician who wrote the report, violated the defendant\u2019s state constitutional right to confront and cross-examine his accuser. <em>See Clark, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 25,30. Importantly, based on the plain language of our Constitution, we held that Montana\u2019s Confrontation Clause provides the accused greater protection than does its federal counterpart, the Sixth Amendment. <em>Clark, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 20-25. We stated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-5\">[ujnlike its federal counterpart, the text of Montana\u2019s Confrontation Clause specifically guarantees the accused\u2019s right \u201cto meet the witnesses against him face to face.\u201d As we noted in <em>State v. Young </em>(1991), 249 Mont. 257, 260, 815 P.2d 590, 592, \u201c[t]he 1972 Montana Constitution and subsequent cases analyzing the Confrontation Clause have made it abundantly clear that full cross-examination is a critical aspect of the right of confrontation.\u201d Moreover, we have recognized that the rights contained in the Declaration of Rights, which include the rights guaranteed to an accused person in a criminal prosecution, are fundamental rights. <em>Wadsworth v. State </em>(1996), 275 Mont. 287, 299, 911 P.2d 1165, 1171-72.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b349-6\"><em>Clark, </em>\u00b6 22 (second alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b349-7\">\u00b658 We then went on to discuss the importance of cross-examination, which is protected by the Confrontation Clause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-8\">Cross-examination is the hallmark of our system of justice because it produces truth. Such things as the demeanor of a witness, his or her body language, and a witness\u2019s hesitancy in giving testimony, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>often communicate as much to the fact-finder as the spoken words.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-F\"><em>Clark, </em>\u00b6 23. Finally, we observed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-4\">[t]he framers of the Montana Constitution appreciated these safeguards and saw fit to distinguish our Confrontation Clause from the United States Constitution by insuring a criminal defendant the right \u201cto meet the witnesses against him face to face.\u201d Mont. Const, art. II, \u00a7 24.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-5\"><em>Clark, </em>\u00b6 24.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">\u00b659 The point of <em>Clark </em>is that whatever confrontation right the Sixth Amendment guarantees to persons accused of crimes, Montana\u2019s Constitution protects this right to an even greater extent because the plain language of our Constitution \u201cspecifically guarantees a criminal defendant the right to a <em>face-to-face </em>confrontation with his or her accusers.\u201d <em>Clark, </em>\u00b6 25 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">B. <em>Crawford </em>and the Federal Right of Confrontation 1. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">\u00b660 Crawford stabbed a man who allegedly tried to rape his wife, Sylvia. Over objection, the prosecution introduced-as evidence that the stabbing was not in self-defense, as Crawford claimed-a tape-recorded statement that Sylvia had made during a police interrogation. Sylvia did not testify at trial because of Washington\u2019s marital privilege; however, this privilege did not extend to out-of-court statements admissible under an exception to the hearsay rule. <em>See Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 38-40, 124 S.Ct. at 1356-58.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">\u00b661 The State invoked the exception for statements against penal interest, Wash. Rule Evid. 804(b)(3) (2003). In response, Crawford argued that, state law notwithstanding, admitting Sylvia\u2019s statement would violate his federal constitutional right to be \u201cconfronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 40, 124 S.Ct. at 1358 (internal quotation marks omitted). In denying Crawford\u2019s objection, the trial court relied on <em>Roberts, supra. </em>Under that case, the out-of-court statement of an unavailable<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> witness against a criminal defendant is not barred if the statement bears \u201cadequate indicia of reliability.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number><em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 40,124 S.Ct. at 1358 (internal quotation marks omitted).

The prosecution played the tape for the jury and referred to it in closing argument as \u201cdamning evidence\u201d that \u201ccompletely refutes\u201d Crawford\u2019s claim of self-defense. <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 40-41, 124 S.Ct. at 1358 (internal quotation marks omitted). The jury convicted Crawford of assault, <em>see Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 41, 124 S.Ct. at 1358, and the Washington Supreme Court upheld the conviction after determining that Sylvia\u2019s statement was \u201creliable,\u201d <em>see Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 38, 124 S.Ct. at 1357.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">\u00b663 On appeal, the United States Supreme Court addressed the issue of whether the procedure used by the Washington courts complied with the Sixth Amendment\u2019s guarantee that \u201c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right... to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 38, 124 S.Ct. at 1357 (alteration and ellipsis in original) (internal quotation marks omitted). In resolving this question against the State, the Court overruled <em>Roberts, </em>at least as that case applies to a particular class of out-of-court statements. <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 68-69,124 S.Ct. at 1374.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">\u00b664 The Court commenced its analysis by discussing the common law tradition and development of the Confrontation Clause. <em>See Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 43-50, 124 S.Ct. at 1359-63. From this history, the Court drew two inferences about the meaning of the Sixth Amendment. First, the Court determined that \u201cthe principle evil at which the Confrontation Clause was directed was the civil-law mode of criminal procedure, and particularly its use of <em>ex parte </em>examinations as evidence against the accused.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 50, 124 S.Ct. at 1363. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>Accordingly, the Court soundly \u201crejected] the view that the Confrontation Clause applies of its own force only to in-court testimony, and that its application to out-of-court statements introduced at trial depends upon the law of Evidence.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 50-51, 124 S.Ct. at 1364 (internal quotation marks omitted). Moreover, the Court explained, \u201c[t]he constitutional text ... reflects an especially acute concern with a specific type of out-of-court statement,\u201d which the Court referred to as \u201ctestimonial\u201d hearsay.* <footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <em>See Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 51, 53, 124 S.Ct. at 1364, 1365.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">\u00b665 The second proposition supported by the history of the Confrontation Clause is \u201cthat the Framers would not have allowed admission of testimonial statements of a -witness who did not appear at trial unless he was unavailable to testify, and the defendant had had a prior opportunity for cross-examination.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 53-54, 124 S.Ct. at 1365. Furthermore, the text of the Sixth Amendment does not suggest that courts may develop \u201copen-ended exceptions from the confrontation requirement.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 54, 124 S.Ct. at 1365. Rather, the Confrontation Clause \u201cis most naturally read as a reference to the right of confrontation at common law, admitting only those exceptions established at the time ofthe founding.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 54, 124 S.Ct. at 1365. Those exceptions \u201cconditioned admissibility of an absent witness\u2019s examination on <em>unavailability </em>and <em>a prior opportunity to cross-examine,\u201d Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 54, 124 S.Ct. at 1366 (emphases added), not on amorphous notions of reliability and trustworthiness. Therefore, the Sixth Amendment incorporates those limitations. <em>See Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 54, 124 S.Ct. at 1366.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">\u00b666 Moreover, the Court determined from the historical record that a prior opportunity to cross-examine was a \u201cnecessary,\u201d and not \u201cmerely a sufficient, ... condition for admissibility of testimonial statements.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number><em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 55, 124 S.Ct. at 1366-67. In other words, the requirement was \u201cdispositive\u201d as to whether a testimonial statement could be admitted; it was not merely one of several ways to establish reliability. <em>See Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 55-56, 124 S.Ct. at 1367. The Court also observed that while there were exceptions to the general rule of exclusion of hearsay evidence in 1791 (the year the Sixth Amendment was ratified), most of those exceptions \u201ccovered statements that by their nature were not testimonial-for example, business records or statements in furtherance of a conspiracy.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 56, 124 S.Ct. at 1367. \u201c[T]here is scant evidence that exceptions were invoked to admit <em>testimonial </em>statements against the accused in a <em>criminal </em>case.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 56,124 S.Ct. at 1367 (emphases in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-4\">\u00b667 The Court then addressed its prior case law, <em>see Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 57-59, 124 S.Ct. at 1367-69, concluding that, for the most part, its jurisprudence (or, at least, the outcomes of its cases) had been consistent with the two propositions discussed above and with the Framers\u2019 understanding of the right of confrontation: \u201cTestimonial statements of witnesses absent from trial have been admitted only where the declarant is unavailable, and only where the defendant has had a prior opportunity to cross-examine.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 59, 124 S.Ct. at 1369.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">\u00b668 In sum, <em>Crawford </em>sets forth a categorical bar: certain hearsay evidence is inadmissible at a criminal trial unless (1) the declarant is unavailable and (2) the defendant has had a prior opportunity to cross-examine the declarant. <em>See Crawford, 541 </em>U.S. at 53-54, 55-56, 59, 68, 124 S.Ct. at 1365,1366-67,1369,1374. The \u201cspecific type of out-of-court statement\u201d implicated by this prohibition is, at a minimum, the \u201ctestimonial\u201d statement of a witness who is absent from trial. <em>See Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 51, 124 S.Ct. at 1364.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">2. \u201cTestimonial\u201d Statements</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">\u00b669 The Court \u201c[left] for another day any effort to spell out a comprehensive definition of \u2018testimonial,\u2019 \u201c <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 68, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>124 S.Ct. at 1374; however, it did, nonetheless, provide a number of insights into what the term means. The Court stated that \u201c[w]hatever else the term covers, it applies at a minimum to prior testimony at a preliminary hearing, before a grand jury, or at a former trial; and to police interrogations.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 68,124 S.Ct. at 1374. We are also told that \u201c[a]n accuser who makes a formal statement to government officers bears testimony,\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 51, 124 S.Ct. at 1364, and that a plea allocution showing the existence of a conspiracy is \u201cplainly testimonial,\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 64,124 S.Ct. at 1372. At the other extreme, \u201c[a]n off-hand, overheard remark\u201d and \u201ca casual remark to an acquaintance\u201d are nontestimonial. <em>See Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 51, 124 S.Ct. at 1364. Also, statements falling within the hearsay exceptions for business records and statements in furtherance of a conspiracy at the time of the framing \u201cby their nature were not testimonial.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 56, 124 S.Ct. at 1367.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">\u00b670 As for statements which do not fit within one of the foregoing examples, the Court provided guidance in the form of three definitions or \u201cformulations\u201d of testimonial statements:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-5\"><em>\u201cex parte </em>in-court testimony or its functional equivalent-that is, material such as affidavits, custodial examinations, prior testimony that the defendant was unable to cross-examine, or similar pretrial statements that declarants would reasonably expect to be used prosecutorially,\u201d Brief for Petitioner 23; \u201cextrajudicial statements ... contained in formalized testimonial materials, such as affidavits, depositions, prior testimony, or confessions,\u201d <em>White v. Illinois, </em>502 U.S. 346, 365 (1992) (THOMAS, J., joined by SCALIA, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); [and] \u201cstatements that were made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial,\u201d Brief for National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers et al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>3.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-6\"><em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 51-52, 124 S.Ct. at 1364 (ellipsis in original). While these formulations suggest the dividing line between \u201ctestimonial\u201d and \u201cnontestimonial,\u201d the Court did not identify any of them as defining the outer boundary of testimonial statements (since Sylvia Crawford\u2019s statement was \u201ctestimonial under any definition,\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 61, 124 S.Ct. at 1370). Rather, the Court observed that \u201c[t]hese formulations all share a common nucleus and then define the Clause\u2019s coverage <em>at various levels of abstraction around it.\u201d Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 52, 124 S.Ct. at 1364 (emphasis added). <em>See also Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 68,124 S.Ct. at 1374 (\u201c[Testimonial] applies <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number><em>at a minimum </em>to prior testimony at a preliminary hearing, before a grand jury, or at a former trial.\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 52, 124 S.Ct. at 1364 (\u201cStatements taken by police officers in the course of interrogations are also testimonial <em>under even a narrow standard\u201d) </em>(emphasis added). (The third formulation-asking whether the circumstances under which a statement was made would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial-is the broadest of the three, while the second-tying the definition of testimonial to \u201cformalized\u201d materials-is the narrowest.) Thus, because the statements by Debra to Grove and King do not fit within any of the aforementioned examples,<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> it is necessary in the case at hand to determine what \u201clevel[] of abstraction,\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 52, 124 S.Ct. at 1364, best reflects the meaning of \u201ctestimonial\u201d as contemplated by <em>Crawford </em>and the Confrontation Clause, and whether Debra\u2019s statements fall within that formulation.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AS9\">\u00b671 In ascertaining the breadth of \u201ctestimonial,\u201d the starting point is the text of the Confrontation Clause itself, which by its terms applies to \u201cwitnesses against [the accused].\u201d U.S. Const, amend. VI. As noted above, the Court rejected the view that this provision applies only to <em>in-court </em>testimony (i.e., persons who testify against the accused at trial). <em>See Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 50-51, 124 S.Ct. at 1364. At the same time, however, the Court made it clear that not <em>all </em>declarants whose out-of-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>court statements are offered at trial to prove the truth of what they assert are \u201cwitnesses\u201d within the meaning of the Sixth Amendment. <em>See Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 51,124 S.Ct. at 1364 (\u201cnot all hearsay implicates the Sixth Amendment\u2019s core concerns\u201d). Rather, the term applies to \u201cthose who Ttear testimony.\u2019 \u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 51, 124 S.Ct. at 1364 (quoting 1 N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language (1828)). Thus, the question becomes under what circumstances besides those listed in <em>Crawford </em>as plainly testimonial-prior testimony at a preliminary hearing, before a grand jury, or at a former trial; police interrogations; a formal statement made by an accuser to a government officer; and a plea allocution showing the existence of a conspiracy-is an out-of-court declarant \u201chearting] testimony.\u201d In other words, when is a declarant functioning as a \u201cwitnessH\u201d against the accused extrajudicially? <em>Cf. </em>Mosteller, <em>Encouraging and Ensuring, supra </em>note 2, at 515 (\u201cIn essence, the issue is whether the core of the Confrontation Clause, covering a relatively small group of statements, is instead the complete confrontation right.\u201d). The answer to this question determines which statements that do not fit within the aforementioned \u201ccommon nucleus\u201d are nevertheless testimonial.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-4\">\u00b672 At the outset, it is necessary to clarify, for the reasons which follow, that neither government involvement nor a particular procedure in procuring a declarant\u2019s statement is required in order for the declarant to function as a witness against the accused. First, all of the formulations set forth in <em>Crawford </em>contemplate statements made in the absence of government officials or agents, and two of the three formulations clearly extend to situations outside the ambit of formalized materials. Specifically, the first formulation refers to the \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d of ex <em>parte </em>in-court testimony, giving affidavits<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> and \u201csimilar pretrial statements that declarants would reasonably expect to be used prosecutorially\u201d as examples. <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 51, 124 S.Ct. at 1364 (internal quotation marks omitted). The second formulation, which is the narrowest of the three, also includes affidavits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>as an example of a testimonial statement.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> <em>See Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 51-52, 124 S.Ct. at 1364. And the third formulation refers to statements that were made \u201cunder circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 52, 124 S.Ct. at 1364 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-4\">\u00b673 Second, in its discussion of the historical development of the right of confrontation and the \u201cprincipal evil\u201d at which the Confrontation Clause was directed, the Court repeatedly emphasized the <em>ex parte </em>aspect of the evidence admitted against the accused and the absence of face to face confrontation. <em>See Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 43-50,124 S.Ct. at 1359-63. Although it was frequently the case that a government official had gathered this evidence pursuant to a prescribed or formalized procedure, it was the accused\u2019s lack of an opportunity to confront his accuser which most concerned the Framers. Indeed, one source of the out-of-court statements read to the jury at Sir Walter Raleigh\u2019s trial was Lord Cobham\u2019s letter.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> <em>See Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 44,124 S.Ct. at 1360. Furthermore, to say that the right of confrontation is concerned only with statements given pursuant to a formalized procedure would render statements most in need of testing \u201cin the crucible of cross-examination,\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 61,124 S.Ct. at 1370, beyond the Clause\u2019s reach.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> It would be a strained interpretation of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>historical record, therefore, to conclude that the Framers would be content with the reading of out-of-court statements as long as they had been given informally to a civilian acquaintance instead of formally to a government official or agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-4\">\u00b674 Third, there is evidence that at the time of the framing, the legal community understood that a person who made an accusation against the defendant was the equivalent of a witness against him, though the statement was not made to a government official or pursuant to a prescribed procedure. <em>See </em>Robert P. Mosteller, <em>Remaking Confrontation Clause and Hearsay Doctrine Under the Challenge of Child Sexual Abuse Prosecutions, </em>1993 U. 111. L. Rev. 691, 749 (1993) (hereinafter, \u201cMosteller, <em>Remaking\u201d).</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b358-5\">For example, in <em>King v. Brasier </em>[(1779), 168 Eng. Rep. 202], an ordinary criminal case decided in England a decade before the drafting of the Confrontation Clause, the defendant was charged with rape of a seven-year-old child and convicted on the testimony of the child\u2019s mother and another individual who related the accusations made to them by the child immediately after she returned home following the assault. The child was not sworn or produced as a witness at trial. The conviction was found invalid because of the determination that \u201cno testimony whatever can be legally received except on oath,\u201d a determination that unmistakably rested on the conclusion that the child was effectively a witness against the defendant despite her oral statement being offered through other witnesses. This procedural infirmity was not forgiven even though the statement would likely have been admitted under modern analysis as an excited utterance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">Mosteller, Remaking, at 749-50 (footnotes omitted). Professor Mosteller also points out that \u201chistorical practice did not depend on whether the statement was made with a view toward legal proceedings.\u201d Mosteller, <em>Remaking, </em>at 750.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">\u00b675 Fourth, pursuant to the procedural rules of our legal system, declarants are able to \u201cbear testimony\u201d in informal extrajudicial settings. This is due to the fact that our legal system generally places no greater restrictions upon a fact-finder in assessing testimony given by a declarant in the form of out-of-court statements versus as a live witness in court. In other words, a fact-finder may give the same weight <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"337\">*337</page-number>to the statement \u201cJoe assaulted me\u201d whether it is repeated by the declarant herself in court, repeated by a police officer on the declarant\u2019s behalf, or repeated by a private citizen on the declarant\u2019s behalf. And the same is true whether the statement is read from the declarant\u2019s diary or from an affidavit signed by the declarant. For this reason, it would be specious to define \u201ctestimonial\u201d as requiring governmental involvement or prescribed formalities in obtaining the statement. <em>See </em>Richard D. Friedman, <em>Confrontation: The Search for Basic Principles, </em>86 Geo. L.J. 1011, 1039 (1998) (hereinafter, \u201cFriedman, <em>Basic </em>Principles\u201d) (\u201cThe question of whether a statement made by a person out-of-court should be considered testimonial-or put another way, whether the person should be considered a witness in making the statement-is not exogenous to the legal system\u2019s procedural rules. Rather, the question depends crucially on those rules because to a large extent it depends on the use that the system makes of the statement.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"AXq\">\u00b676 Lastly, the right of confrontation is expressed in general terms: \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with <em>the witnesses against him.\u201d </em>U.S. Const, amend. VI (emphasis added). This language reflects a target broader than just <em>ex parte </em>examinations by government officials or pursuant to formalized procedures: the ability of a witness to bear testimony extrajudicially, not under oath, and not subject to cross-examination, as did Lord Cobham.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> If examinations of witnesses by government officials or pursuant to particular formalities were the only concern of the Framers, then they surely would have drafted the Clause to reflect this, using narrower language that more directly addressed such concerns (e.g., \u201cthe accused shall enjoy the right to be confronted with the witnesses against him who have provided <em>ex parte </em>testimony pursuant to formal examinations by government officials\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b360-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"338\">*338</page-number>\u00b677 Thus, the definition of \u201cwitnesses against\u201d the accused does not turn on whether the declarant made her statement to a government official or agent (whether of her own initiative or pursuant to an interrogation) or in some prescribed manner, though these factors are undoubtedly relevant to the inquiry. A declarant who, with anticipation that her oral statement will be presented to the fact-finder at a criminal trial, entrusts a civilian acquaintance to relay that statement is surely \u201cbear[ing] testimony,\u201d notwithstanding the absence of governmental involvement in obtaining the statement or prescribed procedures in recording it.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-4\">\u00b678 Furthermore, the meaning of \u201cwitnesses against\u201d is not derived by reference to the particular vices of the civil-law mode of criminal procedure that existed at the time of the framing <em>(ex parte </em>examinations being the primary vice). <em>See generally </em>Mosteller, <em>Remaking, </em>at 751-55.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> To hold otherwise would freeze application of the Clause to a particular historical affront to the common law right of confrontation: the use of <em>ex parte </em>examinations-and modern procedures which \u201cbear a striking resemblance\u201d thereto, such as police interrogations, <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 52, 124 S.Ct. at 1364 \u2014 as evidence against the accused. In other words, to say that the Confrontation Clause applies only to the particular modes of collecting prosecutorial evidence which were known in 1791 (the year the Sixth Amendment was ratified) and which the Framers rejected would leave modern, functionally equivalent means of evading the common law right of confrontation intact, and thereby leave the government free to employ such methods, a possibility the Framers surely recognized but did not intend with the words \u201cwitnesses against.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b360-5\">\u00b679 It is for this reason that \u201cwitnesses against\u201d must be interpreted by reference to the substance-as opposed to the <em>form </em>or manifestations-of the evil at which the Confrontation Clause was directed and which the failings of the civil-law mode of criminal procedure represented. The many shortcomings of the inquisitorial system are obvious. For instance, as the majority observes, denying the right of confrontation creates risks of \u201cpossible prosecutorial misconduct and overzealousness,\u201d \u00b6 15, and \u201cabuse [of] the criminal justice system <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"339\">*339</page-number>[by a declarant] in order to punish, to exact revenge on, or to shift the blame to the defendant,\u201d \u00b6 16. <em>See also </em>Mosteller, <em>Encouraging and Ensuring, </em>at 569-71 (suggesting, with respect to police questioning of a declarant, \u201c[t]hree broad purposes\u201d served by the Confrontation Clause: preventing \u201cgovernment[al] manipulation of the witness in creating the evidence-manipulating the words uttered,\u201d preventing \u201cgovernmental manipulation of the recording of the statement rather than manipulation of what was said,\u201d and \u201cprotecting] the defendant from malicious falsehoods or even errors by the witness independent of governmental manipulation.\u201d). In addition, the accused is unable to explore the declarant\u2019s motives in making the statement, the declarant\u2019s direct knowledge of the facts which the statement asserts as true, the declarant\u2019s ability to have observed and understood the events her statement represents, the declarant\u2019s memory and perception of her situation, and the declarant\u2019s credibility. <em>Cf. Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 65-67, 124 S.Ct. at 1372-73 (discussing the purposes cross-examination would have served at Crawford\u2019s trial).<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">\u00b680 Furthermore, a third party witness who repeats a declarant\u2019s hearsay statement at trial inevitably does so through the filter of his or her own perceptions, prejudices, and motivations. Nevertheless, because the witness is under oath, the declarant\u2019s statement is presumed by the fact-finder to be true. In other words, the hearsay statement itself takes on the mantle of a sworn statement because the third party witness swears to the truth of his or her recollection and rendition of the statement. Absent outright confabulation or perjury, however, a witness testifies only to what he or she <em>believes </em>is the truth-i.e., his or her perceived, subjective understanding of what he or she saw or heard. <em>See State v. Clifford, </em>2005 MT 219, \u00b6 71, 328 Mont. 300, \u00b6 71, 121 P.3d 489, \u00b6 71 (Nelson, J., concurring). Granted, there may be cases in which the defendant will effectively cross-examine a third party witness on issues of bias, powers of observation, ability to retain and recall, etc.; however, doing so is not a sufficient substitute for cross-examining <em>the declarant. </em>\u201cRaleigh was, after all, perfectly free to confront those who read Cobham\u2019s confession in court.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 51, 124 S.Ct. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"340\">*340</page-number>1364. Yet, \u201cRaleigh\u2019s trial has long been thought a paradigmatic confrontation violation.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 52, 124 S.Ct. at 1364.</p>\n<p id=\"APj\">\u00b681 Again, it is the right of the accused to test the truth and reliability of an out-of-court statement \u201cin the crucible of cross-examination\u201d of <em>the declarant, Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 61, 124 S.Ct. at 1370, that the Framers enshrined in the Sixth Amendment. The importance of adversarial testing-which underlies our entire legal system-cannot be understated. In <em>California v. Green </em>(1970), 399 U.S. 149, 90 S.Ct. 1930, 26 L.Ed.2d 489, the Court observed that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-4\">[c]onfrontation: (1) insures that the witness will give his statements under oath-thus impressing him with the seriousness of the matter and guarding against the lie by the possibility of a penalty for perjury; (2) forces the witness to submit to cross-examination, the \u201cgreatest legal engine ever invented for the discovery of truth\u201d; [and] (3) permits the jury that is to decide the defendant\u2019s fate to observe the demeanor of the witness in making his statement, thus aiding the jury in assessing his credibility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AYG\"><em>Green, </em>399 U.S. at 158, 90 S.Ct. at 1935 (footnote omitted). It is not surprising, therefore, that the common law right of confrontation and, thus, the Confrontation Clause</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b362-5\">reflects a judgment, not only about the desirability of reliable evidence (a point on which there could be little dissent), but about <em>how reliability can best be determined. </em>Cf. 3 Blackstone, Commentaries, at 373 (\u201cThis open examination of witnesses ... is much more conducive to the clearing up of truth\u201d); M. Hale, History and Analysis of the Common Law of England 258 (1713) (adversarial testing \u201cbeats and bolts out the Truth much better\u201d).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AMT\"><em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 61-62, 124 S.Ct. at 1370 (ellipsis in original) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">\u00b682 Hence, guaranteeing the right to confront one\u2019s accusers is the Framers\u2019 response to a system that permitted the use at trial of statements not subjected to adversarial testing. Again, some of the shortcomings inherent in such a system are the inability of the accused to probe inconsistencies or untruths in the declarant\u2019s statement and to elicit additional information from the declarant; the potential for misrepresentations (inadvertent though they may be) on the part of the third party witness; the risk of \u201cprosecutorial misconduct and overzealousness,\u201d \u00b6 15; and the potential for \u201cabuse [of] the criminal justice system [by the declarant],\u201d \u00b6 16. This is not to say, however, that the confrontation right arises only when these specific shortcomings are implicated (e.g., only when there is a possibility for prosecutorial misconduct and/or declarant maliciousness). As noted above, if the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>Clause\u2019s reach were limited by strict reference to particular manifestations or symptoms of the mode of criminal procedure rejected by the Framers, then analogous inquisitorial practices would be free to flourish.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">\u00b683 Rather, the confrontation right arises whenever the civil-law system itself is implicated. <em>See Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 48, 124 S.Ct. at 1362 (\u201cAt the Massachusetts ratifying convention, Abraham Holmes objected to [the omission in the proposed Federal Constitution of a right of confrontation] precisely on the ground that it would lead to civil-law practices ....\u201d). This occurs when a declarant creates testimony without doing so before the fact-finder under oath and subject to cross-examination by the accused. <em>See Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 43-50,124 S.Ct. at 1359-63. <em>Cf </em>Mosteller, <em>Encouraging and Ensuring, </em>at 514 (characterizing \u201cthe positive procedural goal of the confrontation right\u201d as \u201cencouraging and ensuring that evidence is presented in the courtroom in the presence of the accused and subject to adversarial testing\u201d). Stated more generally, the substance of the evil at which the Confrontation Clause was directed is the inequity and inaccuracy inherent in a system of criminal procedure which precludes an accused from challenging the reliability of the State\u2019s evidence through meaningful confrontation and permits the State to convict a person on the basis of testimony given extrajudicially. <em>Cf </em>Mosteller, <em>Remaking, </em>at 748 n.277 (characterizing \u201cthe historical evil\u201d as \u201cproof of charges by statements from absent accusers\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">\u00b684 Thus, the Confrontation Clause ensures an adversarial system pursuant to which testimony is given at trial. Given this purpose, an out-of-court declarant \u201cbear[s] testimony\u201d or functions extrajudicially as a \u201cwitnessQ\u201d against the accused when she understands, or should understand, that she is doing so or, independent of her understanding, when the government is gathering evidence for possible prosecutorial use. The evidence-gathering feature of functioning as a witness against the accused is reflected in the first two formulations set forth in <em>Crawford, </em>which refer to \u201ccustodial examinations,\u201d \u201cprior testimony,\u201d and \u201cdepositions,\u201d <em>see Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 51-52, 124 S.Ct. at 1364, as well as the Court\u2019s extended discussion of pretrial <em>examinations </em>of suspects and witnesses by justices of the peace or other officials, <em>see Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 43-48, 124 S.Ct. at 1359-62, while the witness-understanding feature is reflected in <em>Crawford\u2019s </em>first and third formulations, which ask what a declarant would reasonably expect concerning the prosecutorial use of her statements (first formulation) and whether the statements were made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>statements would be available for use at a later trial (third formulation). <em>See Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 51, 52,124 S.Ct. at 1364.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">\u00b685 All three formulations indicate that the proper focus is on the statement\u2019s function or evidentiary purpose, as opposed to its characteristics. <em>See generally </em>Friedman, <em>Grappling, supra </em>note 2, at 3-6.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> In other words, did the statement, at the time it was made, serve the function of in-court testimony? Professor Friedman proposes a general definition of this function: \u201c[The function of prosecution testimony], in rough terms, is the transmittal of information for use in prosecution.\u201d Friedman, <em>Grappling, </em>at 2. In light of the foregoing discussion, whether an out-of-court statement is being transmitted for use in prosecution depends on the nature of the statement, the circumstances under which it was made, and to whom it was made.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> If, given these considerations, the declarant should have anticipated that her statement would be used in a criminal proceeding, she was functioning as a witness against the accused, and her statement is testimonial. (As implicated by the standard itself, this is an objective inquiry, which will be discussed in greater detail below. <em>See </em>\u00b6 89, <em>infra.) </em>Furthermore, if the declarant was speaking to a government agent who was generating testimony, her statement is testimonial regardless of whether she recognized that purpose. <em>See </em>Mosteller, <em>Encouraging and Ensuring, </em>at 614,624. Professor Mosteller points out that \u201cthe Framers feared the role of the government in manipulating the statements received and would not have excused them if the government deluded the witnesses or took advantage of their inadequate knowledge or limited mental capacity.\u201d Mosteller, <em>Encouraging and Ensuring, </em>at 624-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>\u00b686 To state a definition of \u201ctestimonial\u201d any narrower than the foregoing formulation would afford the government ample opportunities to avoid <em>Crawford\u2019s </em>mandate and the right of confrontation through a variety of countermeasures.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-4\">[M]any of the indicators of testimonial statements[-e.g., they were made pursuant to police interrogation, they are contained in formal, signed, written documents, etc.-]can disappear. If such \u201ccookbook\u201d changes in form can render the statements non-testimonial, avoidance of the restriction of <em>Crawford </em>will prove relatively easy for many statements that are not made to police officers, and if there is no Confrontation Clause protection whatsoever for those statements, serious issues of justice as to problematic accusatory statements will go unaddressed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ACR\">Mosteller, <em>Encouraging and Ensuring, </em>at 539-40. Stating a narrower definition also would permit a declarant to act as a witness while escaping confrontation by the simple expedient of making her statement in a manner less formal than the formalities implicated by the first and second formulations set forth in <em>Crawford </em>or to anyone other than a government agent. Professor Friedman, posits the following example:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-5\">A woman tells a counselor at a private shelter that she has been raped. The counselor says:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-6\">Please make a statement for us. We will videotape it and send the tape to the prosecutor. I anticipate that the prosecutor\u2019s office will use it at trial as the cornerstone of its case against your assailant. The prosecutor won\u2019t have to call you as a witness, because that\u2019s just not necessary any more .... The accused might call you-but only if he dares, and only if you\u2019re then available. Which, so far as the law is concerned, you needn\u2019t be. [\u00b6] Oh, and by the way, since you\u2019re not speaking under oath, don\u2019t worry about the prosecutor going after you for perjury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">Friedman, <em>Basic Principles, </em>at 1041.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">\u00b687 If the woman in this example makes the statement and if it is then presented at trial, she undoubtedly was acting as a \u201cwitnessD against\u201d her assailant. She was providing testimony in a manner to which the legal system is receptive; she anticipated that her statement could (and would) be used testimonially; and the counselor essentially acted as a conduit or an agent for the declarant. <em>See </em>Friedman, <em>Basic Principles, </em>at 1041. The fact that the statement was not made to the authorities, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>or even at their instigation, does not alter this conclusion.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A0J\">\u00b688 But even if the declarant is not seeking to escape cross-examination, the result can be no different. It is no less a Confrontation Clause violation to disallow confrontation simply because the declarant\u2019s motives (to the extent those motives are ascertainable) are benign. While protecting the accused from \u201cmalicious falsehoods\u201d perpetrated by the declarant is one goal effectuated by the Clause, the Framers were equally concerned with \u201cunchecked witness error.\u201d <em>See </em>Mosteller, <em>Encouraging and Ensuring, </em>at 571.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">\u00b689 For this reason, the foregoing inquiry-whether the declarant should have anticipated that her statement would be used in a criminal proceeding-is an objective standard,<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> which may be expressed in a number of ways. For instance, given the nature of the statement, the circumstances under which it was made, and to whom it was made, would an objective declarant have believed that the statement would be available for use at a later trial? This inquiry resembles Crawford\u2019s third formulation.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> <em>See Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 52, 124 S.Ct. at 1364. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>Alternatively, should the declarant have understood at the time she made her statement that there was a significant probability the statement would be used prosecutorially? Or, because the declarant is deemed to have intended the natural consequences of her actions, <em>see </em>Friedman, <em>Grappling, </em>at 6-7, was evidentiary use of the statement in a criminal proceeding a natural consequence of the declarant\u2019s actions? <em>See also U.S. v. Summers </em>(10th Cir. 2005), 414 F.3d 1287, 1302 (\u201c[W]e believe an objective test focusing on the reasonable expectations of the declarant under the circumstances of the case more adequately safeguards the accused\u2019s confrontation right and more closely reflects the concerns underpinning the Sixth Amendment. Thus we hold that a statement is testimonial if a reasonable person in the position of the declarant would objectively foresee that his statement might be used in the investigation or prosecution of a crime.\u201d) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">\u00b690 Of particular relevance to this inquiry is whether the statement was accusatorial in nature. <em>See </em>U.S. Const, amend. VI (\u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the <em>accused </em>shall enjoy the right... to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 43,124 S.Ct. at 1359 (\u201cThe right to confront one\u2019s <em>accusers </em>is a concept that dates back to Roman times.\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 43, 124 S.Ct. at 1359 (Pre-trial examinations of suspects and witnesses by justices of the peace or other officials \u201cwere sometimes read in court in lieu of live testimony, a practice that \u2018occasioned frequent demands by the prisoner to have his <em>\u201caccusers,\u201d i.e. the witnesses against him, </em>brought before him face to face.\u2019 \u201c) (emphases added); <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 44, 124 S.Ct. at 1360 (\u201cSuspecting that Cobham would recant, Raleigh demanded that the judges call him to appear .... \u2018Call my <em>accuser </em>before my face ....\u2019 \u201d) (second ellipsis in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>original) (emphasis added); <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 47, 124 S.Ct. at 1362 (\u201cEarly in the 18th century, ... the Virginia Council protested against the Governor for having \u2018privately issued several commissions to examine <em>witnesses against </em>particular men <em>ex parte,\u2019 </em>complaining that \u2018the person accused is not admitted to be confronted with, or defend himself against his <em>defamers.\u2019 \u201d) </em>(emphases added); <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 51,124 S.Ct. at 1364 (\u201cAn <em>accuser </em>who makes a formal statement to government officers bears testimony....\u201d) (emphasis added); <em>California v.

Carter, </em>2005 MT 87, 326 Mont. 427, 114 P.3d 1001, that the Intoxilizer 5000 certification reports were nontestimonial, is most plausibly reconciled with the foregoing discussion of what constitutes a \u201ctestimonial\u201d statement on the ground that the statements represented by the certification reports (e.g., \u201cThis machine has been tested and/or calibrated and produces accurate results.\u201d) are not accusatory in nature.<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> [Text continues on page 348]</p>\n<p id=\"A8Nc\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"349\">*349</page-number>\u00b691 Given these principles, it will often be the case that a person accusing someone of a crime is a \u201cwitnessD,\u201d as contemplated by the Confrontation Clause, <em>see King v. Brasier, supra </em>\u00b6 74, and that statements made by a person claiming to be the victim of a crime and describing that crime are \u201ctestimonial,\u201d <em>see </em>Friedman, <em>Basic Principles, </em>at 1042-43. <em>See also </em>Mosteller, <em>Encouraging and Ensuring, </em>at 608 n.548 (\u201cIf we are to imagine the Framers\u2019 reaction to practices that did not exist at the time, we could imagine few practices that would have been more abhorrent to their values than the concept of a prosecution through the out-of-court accusations of a victim who was not compelled, even if available, to take the stand and make those charges in person to the defendant.\u201d). This is particularly true when the declarant is speaking to a person in whom there is little or no expectation of confidentiality, since it would not be reasonable in such circumstance to anticipate that statements accusing someone of a crime and/or describing a crime will not be further transmitted for use at trial as evidence against the accused.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\">\u00b692 On the other hand, if such statements were made under circumstances in which the declarant had a reasonable expectation of confidentiality-e.g., during a conversation with a private mental health professional within the confines of the doctor-patient privilege-then the declarant reasonably could expect that the statements would not be introduced at a later trial. As such, they would be nontestimonial. The same is true of the statement, \u201cIf it hadn\u2019t been for that dirty son-of-a-bitch Alex Evans, we wouldn\u2019t be in this now,\u201d <em>Dutton v. Evans </em>(1970), 400 U.S. 74, 77, 91 S.Ct. 210, 214, 27 L.Ed.2d 213 (plurality opinion), made by Evans\u2019 coconspirator (Williams) during the concealment phase of their conspiracy. <em>See Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 57, 124 S.Ct. at 1368 (characterizing the foregoing hearsay statement at issue in <em>Dutton </em>as \u201cnot testimonial\u201d).<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Though Williams\u2019 statement may have been accusatorial in nature (the jury was \u201cinvited to infer that Williams had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>implicitly identified Evans as the perpetrator of the murder when he blamed Evans for his predicament,\u201d <em>Dutton, </em>400 U.S. at 88, 91 S.Ct. at 219), it \u201ccontained no express assertion about past fact,\u201d <em>Dutton, </em>400 U.S. at 88, 91 S.Ct. at 219, it was made to a \u201cfellow prisoner[],\u201d <em>Dutton, </em>400 U.S. at 77, 91 S.Ct. at 214, and making it was \u201cagainst [Williams\u2019] penal interest,\u201d <em>Dutton, </em>400 U.S. at 89, 91 S.Ct. at 220. As such, it cannot be said that Williams should have anticipated that the statement would be used in a criminal proceeding against Evans.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">\u00b693 Similarly, statements (even those that are accusatorial) made to family members, friends, and other intimates, in whom there is typically an expectation of privacy or confidentiality, will frequently be nontestimonial. As Professor Mosteller points out,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-5\">the vast majority of statements made to private individuals are made for a purpose other than creating evidence .... Such statements are typically made to convey information to accomplish other purposes, or for no real purpose other than to share the burden of an emotional event. Moreover, most statements made to private individuals tend to be made without any anticipation by the speaker that the statement will be conveyed beyond the immediate audience, let alone that it will be used at trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ALYy\">Mosteller, <em>Encouraging and Ensuring, </em>at 573. On the other hand, if it appears from the circumstances that the declarant should have understood that her statements to a family member, friend, acquaintance, etc. would be conveyed beyond that person, then the statements are testimonial.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">\u00b694 As the foregoing discussion and examples illustrate, the nature of the out-of-court statement, the circumstances or formalities under which it was made, and to whom it was made all inform the reasonable anticipation or expectation of the declarant as to whether her statement will be used for evidentiary purposes. The reasonable anticipation or expectation of the declarant, in turn, determines whether the declarant was functioning as a \u201cwitnessD against\u201d the accused and, ultimately, whether her statement was \u201ctestimonial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">\u00b695 Professor Mosteller \u201csuggests] one dividing line. When a statement is accusatory and intended to be conveyed beyond those who would be expected to keep it confidential-to government agents, private agencies that perform government functions, and strangers at arms length from the witness-it should be considered testimonial.\u201d Mosteller, <em>Encouraging and Ensuring, </em>at 544.1 find this conception to be a useful guideline; however, I believe the proper focus should be on what the circumstances would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe, <em>see Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 52, 124 S.Ct. at 1364, not on the declarant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"351\">*351</page-number>subjective intent, which is frequently difficult, if not impossible, to ascertain in the declarant\u2019s absence. <em>Cf U.S. v. Cromer </em>(6th Cir. 2004), 389 F.3d 662, 675 (\u201cThe proper inquiry, then, is whether the declarant intends to bear testimony against the accused. That intent, in turn, may be determined by querying <em>whether a reasonable person in the declarant\u2019s position would anticipate his statement being used against the accused in investigating and prosecuting the crime.\u201d) </em>(emphasis added). For this reason, I also do not subscribe to Professor Mosteller\u2019s corresponding suggestion (which the majority apparently approves, <em>see </em>\u00b6 23 &amp; n.3) that when a statement was made to a strictly private party, \u201cthe burden can properly be placed on the defendant to show that it was for a testimonial purpose.\u201d Mosteller, <em>Encouraging and Ensuring, </em>at 544. <em>See also </em>Mosteller, <em>Encouraging and Ensuring, </em>at 572. Absent confrontation, a defendant cannot prove whether the declarant\u2019s purpose was testimonial or whether she intended the statement to be conveyed beyond those who would be expected to keep it confidential. Rather, the prosecutor, who will always be the proponent of the hearsay statement where a Confrontation Clause issue arises, is the party most likely to have had access to the declarant (either directly or through another agent of the government, such as the investigating officer). Moreover, requiring the State to establish the admissibility of its proffered evidence comports with the fact that the Confrontation Clause is a restriction on the State, not the accused. Thus, the burden of proof is properly placed on the State to establish that the hearsay evidence it seeks to introduce is nontestimonial.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">\u00b696 Turning now to the majority\u2019s formulation of \u201ctestimonial,\u201d the majority desultorily sets forth a number of assertions concerning the purpose of the Confrontation Clause, after which it \u201c[b]ring[s] together these rationales,\u201d \u00b6 23, into the following definition:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-5\">generally, when a declarant knowingly speaks to a police officer or governmental agent, her statements are presumed testimonial. If, however, the declarant had objective reason to believe that her statement would serve only to avert or mitigate an imminent or immediate danger and the agent who received the statement had no intent to create evidence, the statement is presumed to be nontestimonial. Alternatively, unless the declarant had clear reason to believe that the statement would be used in court as substantive evidence against the defendant, her statements to a non-governmental agent are nontestimonial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">\u00b6 23. The majority then applies this formulation, as well as several additional factors not set forth in its formulation, to the facts of this case, thereby demonstrating that its approach is unfaithful to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"352\">*352</page-number>historical foundation of the Confrontation Clause, is contrary to the common law right of confrontation, and fails to properly safeguard an accused\u2019s right to confront the witnesses against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">\u00b697 At the outset, it must be acknowledged that the majority\u2019s analysis contains significant inconsistencies which make it unclear precisely what standard a court is to apply and what considerations the majority deems determinative in the \u201ctestimonial\u201d inquiry. For instance, whether a statement is testimonial appears to turn on the declarant\u2019s knowledge, belief, purpose, motivation, emotional state, and understanding of the elements of the charged offense (subjective factors), <em>see </em>\u00b6\u00b6 18,20,23,27; nevertheless, the majority insists that the declarant\u2019s reasonable expectation (an objective factor) is determinative, <em>see </em>\u00b6\u00b6 23 n.3, 29 n.7. We are told that a declarant who is knowingly speaking to a government agent should expect her statements to be used at trial, <em>see </em>\u00b6\u00b6 18, 23; yet we are also told that a declarant\u2019s expectation when speaking to a 911 operator depends on the content of the conversation and the particular circumstances that led to the call\u2019s being placed, <em>see </em>\u00b6 20. The majority disapproves Professor Mosteller\u2019s \u201cproposed \u2018declarant\u2019s intent\u2019 standard because of the practical difficulty of divining the intentions of an absent declarant except by reference to what they [sic] have reason to believe,\u201d \u00b6 23 n.3, but in support of its argument that Debra\u2019s statements to Grove were nontestimonial, the majority cites Professor Mosteller\u2019s \u201cproposed method for ascertaining whether a statement is testimonial,\u201d \u00b6 28, the same method the majority disapproved because it turns on the intent of the speaker. The majority finds the setting in which the statement was made both significant, <em>see </em>\u00b6\u00b6 18, 21, and insignificant, <em>see </em>\u00b6\u00b6 17, 23. The list goes on, but the point is that, in light of these ambiguities, no District Court could ever reach an incorrect \u201ctestimonial\u201d determination; no matter which way the court came out, it could find support for its result in the majority opinion in this case. Simply put, the majority\u2019s approach leaves the interpretation of \u201ctestimonial\u201d to the predilections of the particular cotut attempting to apply it.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">\u00b698 Of course, because the majority concludes that Debra\u2019s statements to Ring and Buennemeyer were \u201ccumulative,\u201d \u00b6\u00b6 26, 29, that Debra\u2019s statements to Grove \u201c[a]rguably ... [were] also cumulative,\u201d \u00b6 29 n.6, and that the admission of these statements was, thus, harmless error, <em>see </em>\u00b6 26, it was unnecessary in this case for the majority to articulate a precise and workable definition of testimonial. Its discussion of the Confrontation Clause, its formulation of testimonial, and its application of that formulation to the facts of this case, therefore, are nothing more than an extensive judicial dictum. Notwithstanding its amorphous and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>gratuitous analysis, however, it is still possible-and necessary-to address several fundamental shortcomings in the majority\u2019s approach. \u00b699 First, due either to its dissatisfaction with the formulations of \u201ctestimonial\u201d set forth in <em>Crawford </em>or to its unfounded belief that <em>Crawford </em>contains a \u201ctacit warning\u201d to lower courts against adopting any of those formulations, \u00b6 29, the majority embarks on its own independent expedition to define the term, <em>see </em>\u00b6\u00b6 11-23. While the majority does reference <em>Crawford </em>a number of times during this journey, at no time does it mention, let alone identify, <em>Crawford\u2019s </em>formulations, except to acknowledge that the Court gave \u201cnumerous examples\u201d of testimonial, which the majority terms a \u201cdefinitional void.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">\u00b6100 Ultimately, the majority sets forth a definition of testimonial that bears little resemblance to the formulations set forth by the Supreme Court in <em>Crawford. </em>It conditions the determination of whether an out-of-court statement is testimonial on the official capacity (i.e., government agent versus private party) of the person to whom the declarant was speaking, her knowledge thereof, her belief as to the \u201csubstantive\u201d use of her statement, her belief as to the intent of the government agent to whom she was speaking (if she was knowingly speaking to one) to create evidence, and whether those beliefs were clearly or objectively reasonable.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> This imaginative definition flows from the majority\u2019s mistaken belief that the Confrontation Clause was designed merely to eradicate devious declarants and perfervid police officers from the criminal justice system.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">\u00b6101 Specifically, the majority points to \u201cthe two concerns engendered by [testimonial] evidence\u201d: \u201cpossible prosecutorial misconduct and overzealousness\u201d and \u201cthe declarant\u2019s opportunity to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>abuse the criminal justice system in order to punish, to exact revenge on, or to shift the blame to the defendant.\u201d \u00b6\u00b6 15,16. Having identified these concerns as the basis for the right of confrontation, the majority proceeds on the premise that a statement is testimonial only when these concerns are implicated-namely, in \u201c[a]ny situation in which the declarant is knowingly speaking to the police or government agents,\u201d since such situation \u201cimplicates concerns both with the declarant\u2019s motivation and with the possibility of prosecutorial misconduct.\u201d \u00b6 18. For instance, \u201cthe police may deliberately or inadvertently color the substance of their statements to reflect their own prejudices and understandings of the situation, or may selectively record the declarant\u2019s statements.\u201d \u00b6 18. (Curiously, the majority is not concerned that private individuals to whom statements are made might do the same.)</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">\u00b6102 Notably, the inconsistency with which these two concerns are relevant in the majority\u2019s formulation is immediately apparent from the presumption that a statement made knowingly to a government agent is nontestimonial when \u201cthe declarant had objective reason to believe that [the] statement would serve only to avert or mitigate an imminent or immediate danger.\u201d \u00b6 23. This exception to the majority\u2019s government agent standard ignores \u201cthe declarant\u2019s opportunity to abuse the criminal justice system,\u201d \u00b6 16, since a declarant could have \u201cobjective reason to believe\u201d that her statement, <em>though false, </em>will serve only to avert or mitigate an imminent or immediate danger. Perhaps the majority had in mind only declarants who reside in Wonderland, where the motive to seek aid precludes the telling of untruths. <em>Cf. U.S. v. Wilmore </em>(9th Cir. 2004), 381 F.3d 868, 869 (911 caller lied to 911 operator \u201cin order to get the police to respond quickly to [her] call\u201d). Similarly, there is no reason to assume that the police will not \u201cdeliberately or inadvertently color the substance of their statements\u201d or \u201cselectively record the declarant\u2019s statements,\u201d \u00b6 18, simply because the declarant had objective reason to believe that her statements would serve only to avert or mitigate an imminent or immediate danger, or because the agent who received the statements had no intent at the time to create evidence, or because the declarant unknowingly spoke to a government agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">\u00b6103 But, aside from the fact that the majority\u2019s formulation does not consistently reflect the purported concerns with possible prosecutorial misconduct and overzealousness and a declarant\u2019s opportunity to abuse the criminal justice system in order to punish, to exact revenge on, or to shift the blame to the defendant, the important point here is that the majority\u2019s attempt to conform its formulation of \u201ctestimonial\u201d to these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>two concerns has led it to an incorrect statement of what constitutes a testimonial statement. As <em>Crawford </em>makes clear, \u201c[t]he Sixth Amendment must be interpreted with [a] focus\u201d on the <em>practices </em>\u201cthat the founding-era rhetoric decried.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 50,124 S.Ct. at 1363. Those \u201cpractices\u201d were not ongoing abuse of the criminal justice system by declarants and excessive zealousness in criminal trials by prosecutors, but rather the customary use of unchallenged evidence against the accused at trial. The Framers certainly were aware that the use of unchallenged evidence at trial engenders <em>risks </em>of misconduct on the part of declarants and government agents; however, their concern was more generalized. <em>See </em>Mosteller, <em>Encouraging and Ensuring, </em>at 571-72 (Critics of the civil-law practice \u201cbelieved that ordinary evidence should be presented before the trier of fact and subjected to testing, <em>even if the only concern was the error of the private accuser or others, </em>who gave their evidence to the magistrate.\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">\u00b6104 Indeed, the message of <em>Crawford </em>is not that the Framers intended with the words \u201cthe accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him,\u201d U.S. Const, amend. VI, to guarantee an accused the right only to ascertain whether his accusers are well-intentioned and whether the police officer(s) and prosecutor(s) who investigated his case are virtuous. Rather, the core of <em>Crawford\u2019s </em>history lesson is that the Framers abhorred \u201cthe inquisitorial method of <em>both </em>evidence development <em>and </em>trial, symbolized by the treason trial ofSir Walter Raleigh.\u201d <em>Mosteller, Encouraging and Ensuring, </em>at 514-15 (emphases added). They \u201cknew that judges, like other government officers, could not always be trusted to safeguard the rights of the people,\u201d and they \u201cwere loath to leave too much discretion in judicial hands.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 67,124 S.Ct. at 1373. Thus, they sought to ensure that the reliability of evidence presented at trial against an accused would \u201cbe assessed in a particular manner: by testing in the crucible of cross-examination.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 61, 124 S.Ct. at 1370. Evidence may be unreliable for a number of reasons, such as those set forth by the majority, <em>see </em>\u00b6\u00b6 15-16, 18, and those discussed above, <em>see </em>\u00b6\u00b6 79-81. However, the right of confrontation is a procedural guarantee. <em>See Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 42, 61, 124 S.Ct. at 1359, 1370. It is expressed in broad terms and reflects the Framers\u2019 disdain for a procedural <em>system </em>in which a declarant, irrespective of her intentions toward the accused, could bear testimony extrajudicially and in which the government, irrespective of the zeal of its agents, could convict based on <em>ex parte </em>evidence against an accused at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number>\u00b6 105 It was not Lord Cobham\u2019s motivations for writing his accusatory letter(s)-whether or not they were \u201cto abuse the criminal justice system in order to punish, to exact revenge on, or to shift the blame to\u201d Raleigh-with which the Framers were concerned. Rather, their objection was to the fact that Raleigh was not allowed to cross-examine Cobham and thereby <em>himself </em>explore Cobham\u2019s motivations in making the accusations. The irony of the majority\u2019s formulation, therefore, is that a judicial officer-not the accused-determines the declarant\u2019s motivations, purposes, knowledge, and/or beliefs when making her out-of-court statement and, to make matters worse, does so in the absence of the declarant and without subjecting her to any examination whatsoever!</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">\u00b6106 In sum, the possibility of \u201cprosecutorial misconduct and overzealousness\u201d and a \u201cdeclarant\u2019s opportunity to abuse the criminal justice system in order to punish, to exact revenge on, or to shift the blame to the defendant\u201d are two byproducts of the civil-law system which the Confrontation Clause rejects. It is not sufficient merely to place a band-aid over these two features of that system by making application of the right of confrontation depend on whether the situation in which the out-of-court statement was made presented risks of governmental manipulation and/or maliciousness on the part of the declarant. Rather, \u201ctestimonial\u201d must be defined by reference to the system itself, which allowed a declarant to function as a \u201cwitnessO against\u201d the accused extrajudicially. Thus, because the majority\u2019s formulation derives from a misinterpretation of the evil at which the Confrontation Clause was directed, it fails to fully safeguard an accused from that evil.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">\u00b6107 Another fundamental shortcoming in the majority\u2019s approach is its misguided attempt to emulate <em>Crawford\u2019s </em>polar examples of what is and is not \u201ctestimonial.\u201d <em>See Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 51, 124 S.Ct. at 1364 (contrasting \u201ca formal statement to government officers\u201d with \u201ca casual remark to an acquaintance\u201d). The majority repeatedly distinguishes formal statements from casual remarks and conversations with law enforcement from conversations over backyard fences, <em>see </em>\u00b6\u00b6 17,18,19, 20, 21,23, 27, 30; yet, it does not provide a useful method <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>of ascertaining on which side of the line the myriad other statements (i.e., those that do not fall into these examples) lie. <em>See </em>Friedman, <em>Grappling, </em>at 17 (\u201cThe two polar categories, \u2018a formal statement to government officers\u2019 and \u2018a casual remark to an acquaintance,\u2019 plainly do not exhaust all possibilities, and so presenting these two does not indicate where the boundary between testimonial and non-testimonial lies.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">\u00b6 108 Granted, we are told that a statement to a known governmental agent is presumed testimonial (unless the declarant had objective reason to believe that her statement would serve only to avert or mitigate an imminent or immediate danger and that the agent to whom she was speaking had no intent to create evidence) and that a statement to a private party is presumed nontestimonial (unless the declarant had clear reason to believe that the statement would be used in court as substantive evidence against the defendant). <em>See </em>\u00b6 23. However, we are not told how these presumptions are overcome, what facts are relevant in this regard, and what standard applies. The majority places the burden on the defendant to show that the State\u2019s proffered hearsay evidence, if made to a private individual, \u201cwas clearly or exclusively intended to be testimonial.\u201d \u00b6 23 n.3. Yet, the majority provides no assurances that the accused will be able to interview the declarant prior to trial on her intent, knowledge, or belief at the time she made her statements. Furthermore, the majoritys inquiry leaves numerous sub-inquiries unanswered, such as what would give a declarant \u201cclear reason\u201d to believe that her statement would be used in court as \u201csubstantive\u201d (as opposed to impeachment or credibility) evidence against the defendant, what would give a declarant \u201cobjective reason\u201d to believe that a government agent did not have a specific intent to create evidence, etc. Thus, to the extent the majoritys system of presumptions is meant to identify the dividing line between testimonial and nontestimonial statements, it is wholly inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"A0pA\">\u00b6109 Equally unavailing is the majoritys observation that \u201c[w]hen speaking to government agents or officials, the circumstances are such that a declarant should reasonably expect that the government will seek to use those statements at trial. Whereas when a declarant speaks with her neighbor across the backyard fence, she has much less of an expectation that the government will make prosecutorial use of those statements.\u201d \u00b6 18. <em>See also </em>\u00b6 21 (\u201cWe do not assume that a declarant speaking to her neighbor across the backyard fence reasonably expects that the government will seek to use her statements as testimony.\u201d). Is this because conversations which take place over backyard fences only consist of \u201c \u2018casual\u2019 remarks\u201d? <em>See </em>\u00b6 21. Or, is it because neighbors never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>report crimes or repeat statements of an accusatorial nature?</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">\u00b6110 Perhaps the majority\u2019s point is that the setting in which the statement was made informs the reasonable expectation of the declarant. I do not disagree with this proposition; rather, it is the undue emphasis the majority seems to place on the setting-as well as the undue emphasis it places on the official (versus private) status of the person to whom the declarant was speaking-with which I disagree. The correct focus-one which is entirely absent from the majority\u2019s analysis-is on whether the declarant is functioning as a witness, which in turn depends on the nature of her statement <em>and </em>whether it was made under circumstances (i.e., where and to whom she made it) that would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial, <em>see Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 52,124 S.Ct. at 1364; in other words, what should the declarant have anticipated regarding the probable prosecutorial use of her statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">\u00b6111 Lastly, aside from the foregoing definitional problems, the majority\u2019s formulation is unworkable. As noted above, the majority claims that its formulation applies an objective standard. <em>See </em>\u00b6\u00b6 23 n.3, 29 n.7. Yet, the majority\u2019s references to what an \u201cobjective\u201d or \u201creasonable\u201d declarant \u201cwould expect\u201d and what a declarant \u201cshould reasonably expect,\u201d <em>see </em>\u00b6\u00b6 17, 18, 20, 23 n.3, are rendered ambiguous at best by the majority\u2019s ultimate conclusion that \u201ctestimonial\u201d depends on subjective considerations: the declarant\u2019s belief, her knowledge of the official capacity of the person to whom she was speaking and his intent to create evidence, and her understanding of the substantive use of hearsay statements at trial. <em>See </em>\u00b6 23. Also contrary to the majority\u2019s purported objective inquiry is the fact that its formulation is designed with the declarant\u2019s motivations in mind-specifically, her ability \u201cto abuse the criminal justice system in order to punish, to exact revenge on, or to shift the blame to the defendant.\u201d \u00b6 16 (citing as an example of this concern Cobham\u2019s motivation \u201cto save himself\u2019). <em>See also </em>\u00b6\u00b6 18, 20 (referring to \u201cthe declarant\u2019s motivation\u201d and \u201chis primary motivation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">\u00b6112 Thus, it is a mystery how a court is to apply the majority\u2019s \u201cstandard\u201d objectively. Indeed, it appears that the majority\u2019s formulation will have courts throughout Montana regularly divining<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>what a given declarant did and did not know about the person to whom she was speaking; what she believed regarding the substantive use of her statement against the defendant and/or the intent of the government agent (to whom she was knowingly speaking) to create evidence; and whether she believed that her statement would serve to avert or mitigate an imminent or immediate danger, and nothing more.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> <em>See </em>\u00b6 23. In other words, the determination of whether a statement was \u201ctestimoniar will turn on speculative assumptions about an absent witness\u2019s beliefs, knowledge, and purposes, notwithstanding the Supreme Court\u2019s admonition that \u201c[o]nly cross-examination could reveal [a declarant\u2019s perception of her situation].\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 66,124 S.Ct. at 1373.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">\u00b6113 Furthermore, the results of these exercises in clairvoyance will vary from one judge to another, as did reliability determinations under <em>Roberts\u2019 </em>\u201cunpredictable and inconsistent\u201d framework. <em>See Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 66, 124 S.Ct. at 1372. As such, the majority\u2019s \u201cobjective\u201d formulation not only is as unpredictable and difficult to apply as was the <em>Roberts </em>test, it also, like the <em>Roberts </em>test, will \u201callow[] a jury to hear evidence, untested by the adversary process, based on a mere judicial determination of\u2019 a declarant\u2019s belief, knowledge, and purpose in making her out-of-court statement, <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 62,124 S.Ct. at 1370, and thus will \u201cfail[] to provide meaningful protection from even core confrontation violations,\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 63, 124 S.Ct. at 1371.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">\u00b6114 By analyzing the issue of whether an out-of-court statement was testimonial without due consideration of the text and historical underpinnings of the Confrontation Clause, the majority has betrayed the protection afforded by the common law right of confrontation. As a result, the majority\u2019s formulation of \u201ctestimonial\u201d merely substitutes one unworkable test (i.e., Roberts) for another (a belief/knowledge/purpose test). In so doing, the majority has misapplied the Confrontation Clause to the facts of this case, as discussed below.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">3. The Hearsay Statements at Issue are \u201cTestimonial\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">\u00b6115 As explained above, a statement is \u201ctestimonial\u201d when the declarant made it under circumstances that would lead an objective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial. <em>See </em>\u00b6 89, <em>supra-, Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 52,124 S.Ct. at 1364. In other words, what should the declarant have anticipated regarding the probable prosecutorial use of her statement given the nature of her statement, the circumstances under which it was made, and to whom it was made. (Again, she is deemed to have intended the natural consequences of her actions.) Here, Debra\u2019s statements to Grove, King, and Buennemeyer are testimonial.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">\u00b6 116 Dawn Grove testified that she observed the Mizenkos arrive by car at their home at approximately 4:00 P.M. on October 3, 2003, and that at approximately 5:00 P.M., Debra appeared at her door, with a large dog, \u201cvisibly upset\u201d and with a wound on her cheek or jaw. Grove had no recollection of Debra crying. Debra asked Grove to call 911 and another person, Carol Richard. Over objection, Grove testified that \u201c[Debra] said that her husband had been drinking and was trying to hurt her.\u201d Grove did not let Debra into her home. Rather, she placed the call to 911 on a cordless phone and handed the phone out to Debra. Grove did not hear Debra\u2019s conversation with the dispatcher.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">\u00b6117 Debra\u2019s statement that \u201c[my] husband [has] been drinking and [is] trying to hurt [me]\u201d (assuming Grove accurately recounted it) is undoubtedly testimonial. First, the nature of the statement was accusatorial, as Debra was claiming to be the victim of a crime, was describing the nature of that crime (domestic abuse), and was identifying the perpetrator of the crime (her husband). Granted, she did not give Grove a <em>detailed </em>account of what had taken place in the Mizenko home that afternoon, and her statement was not formal by any means; but it was compelling accusatorial evidence nonetheless. Indeed, the prosecutor found the statement to be <em>extremely </em>compelling, as he asked Grove to repeat it at Mizenko\u2019s trial, then repeated it himself while Grove was still on the stand (\u201cQ. And you stated that he had been drinking and had hurt her?\u201d \u201cA. Yes.\u201d), and then relied on it in his argument to the jury (\u201c[W]hat [Debra] told Dawn Grove, is what [Mizenko] did.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">\u00b6118 Second, Grove testified at trial that \u201cI know [Mizenko] a little bit more than [Debra] but I don\u2019t know them very well.\u201d Thus, although Debra was speaking to a private party, it was someone with whom she did not have an intimate relationship or an expectation of confidentiality. <em>Cf. </em>Mosteller, <em>Encouraging and Ensuring, </em>at 544 (\u201cWhen a statement is accusatory and intended to be conveyed beyond those who would be expected to keep it confidential-to government agents, private agencies that perform government functions, and <em>strangers at arms length from the witness </em>\u2014 it should be considered <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>testimonial.\u201d) (emphasis added). An expectation of confidentiality would have been especially unreasonable here in light of Debra\u2019s concurrent request that Grove call 911.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">\u00b6119 Third, Debra herself set the prosecutorial machinery in motion by walking over to Grove\u2019s house, stating that Mizenko was trying to hurt her, asking Grove to call the authorities, and then telling King (the 911 operator) that she wanted Mizenko arrested. As the following colloquy between King and Debra establishes, Debra undoubtedly understood (and even intended) with all of the statements she made <em>after leaving her house, </em>as well as the evidence she left behind there, that she was creating evidence for prosecutorial use against Mizenko.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A36\">King: What\u2019s going on out there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-5\">Debra: Um. He hit me, pulled my hair out, and knocked me down. I tried so hard not to call, but um, this is ridiculous. I can\u2019t do this anymore.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-6\">King: So he has hit you and he\u2019s pulled out your hair?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-7\">Debra: Yes. There\u2019s evidence of it in the house. I\u2019m at the neighbor\u2019s. I left the hair on the floor and everything else. I want him arrested!</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">Significantly, Mizenko had been arrested for and convicted of Partner or Family Member Assault at least twice within the preceding twelve months.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Thus, Debra <em>had </em>to have understood that there was a significant probability her statement to Grove accusing Mizenko of this same crime would be used prosecutorially.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Indeed, I seriously doubt that the resulting prosecution came as a surprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">\u00b6120 Accordingly, given Debra\u2019s arm\u2019s length relationship with Grove, the incriminating nature of her statement (which is undeniable, given the fact that the prosecutor elicited it from Grove and then repeated it himself at least twice during Mizenko\u2019s trial), and the fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>that Debra solicited the involvement of law enforcement, she should have realized that she was creating evidence and she should have anticipated-whether she intended it or not-that her accusatory-statements made to Grove and King for the explicit purpose of having Mizenko arrested once again would be used in a later prosecution of him.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">\u00b6121 Nevertheless, the majority holds that Debra\u2019s statements to Grove are nontestimonial. <em>See </em>\u00b6 27. This conclusion rests on several mischaracterizations of the nature of Debra\u2019s statements as well as a number of speculations not supported by the record. For instance, the majority, using its sixth sense, states that \u201cDebra, having fled her own home ..., sought sanctuary from which to take her next step\u201d; that \u201cshe sought the immediate solace that [Grove] could provide\u201d; and that she went to Grove\u2019s house in order \u201cto share the burden of a traumatic beating.\u201d \u00b6 27. Yet, the only statements from Debra to Grove in the record before us are \u201cCall 911!\u201d and \u201c[My] husband [has] been drinking and [is] trying to hurt [me].\u201d There is no evidence that Debra asked for sanctuary; rather, the record reflects that she only asked Grove to call 911 and Carol Richard and that, upon concluding her call to 911, Debra returned home, where Deputy Buennemeyer found her upon arriving at the scene. Moreover, the record establishes that Grove barely knew Debra; that they were not friends who shared the burdens of traumatic events with each other; that Grove did not let Debra into her home; that Grove instead handed a cordless phone out to Debra and then walked away (Grove testified that she did not hear Debra\u2019s conversation with the 911 operator); and that after the 911 call, Debra did not remain at Grove\u2019s house to plan her next step or obtain solace. Thus, Debra\u2019s statements to Grove and the circumstances in which they were made cannot fairly be characterized as a confidential conversation in the nature of sharing an emotional burden.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">\u00b6122 The majority also conjectures that Debra did not call 911 and Carol Richard from the Mizenkos\u2019 house because she \u201cdid not feel sufficiently secure\u201d there. \u00b6 27. Yet, there is nothing in the record to explain why Debra walked to Grove\u2019s house to make her call(s). (It is also unclear whether Debra ever called Carol Richard.) What the record does establish is that Debra returned home to wait for Deputy Buennemeyer, notwithstanding \u201cthe very real possibility that Mizenko <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>would return and continue the assault,\u201d \u00b6 27.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> Thus, an equally plausible theory for why Debra did not call 911 and Carol Richard from the Mizenkos\u2019 house is that she wanted a witness to her accusations and her physical condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">\u00b6123 The majority\u2019s portrayal of the circumstances in which Debra made her statements to Grove, therefore, is not supported by the record. Furthermore, while the majority reasonably infers that these statements provided context for why Debra had \u201csuddenly] appear[ed], with dog in tow and a freshly bruised face, on [Grove\u2019s] doorstep,\u201d \u00b6 27, the fact that Debra\u2019s statements may have explained her presence at Grove\u2019s doorstep does not make them nontestimonial. Rather, the question is whether Debra should have understood there was a significant probability the statements would be used prosecutorially. For the reasons discussed above, she should have.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">\u00b6124 Similarly unavailing is the majority\u2019s alternative characterization of Debra\u2019s statements to Grove as \u201cprimarily a cry for help.\u201d \u00b6 27. It is unclear what the majority means by \u201ca cry for help,\u201d particularly in light of the facts that Debra never requested medical assistance from anyone (despite the fact that she had a visible wound on her cheek or jaw) and that Mizenko had left his and Debra\u2019s house by the time of Debra\u2019s call to 911. But even if Debra\u2019s statements were \u201cprimarily a cry for help,\u201d this does not make them nontestimonial, since a cry for help may at the same time be an accusatorial statement (e.g., \u201cThat man just stole my purse!\u201d or \u201cMy husband just beat me! Call 911!\u201d) that the declarant anticipates or should anticipate will be used <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>prosecutorially. Is the problem that Debra\u2019s accusation was not sufficiently explicit relative to her cry for help (yet another undefined standard)? We are left to speculate, though it is worth noting that such a premise (that the statement is testimonial only if the accusatorial aspect of the statement outweighs the aid-seeking aspect of the statement) has no support in <em>Crawford.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">\u00b6125 Attributing uncommon naivet\u00e9 to Debra, the majority ultimately decides that she \u201clacked reason to believe that her statement would be used prosecutorially as substantive evidence against Mizenko.\u201d \u00b6 27. This conclusion is belied by the facts that Mizenko had been arrested for and convicted of Partner or Family Member Assault at least twice within the preceding twelve months and that Debra felt she \u201c[couldn\u2019t] do this anymore,\u201d left evidence of the alleged assault in the house, and walked over to Grove\u2019s house with an intent she later stated explicitly to King to have Mizenko arrested. The majority argues that \u201c[i]f she had anticipated such use, in all likelihood, she would have divulged greater detail, as she later did when speaking with 911 operator King.\u201d \u00b6 27. This reasoning presumes, however, that Debra expected Grove not to remain nearby (or at least within earshot) while Debra \u201cdivulged greater detail\u201d of the alleged assault to King, which seems unlikely if, as the majority claims, Debra went to Grove\u2019s house expecting to obtain \u201cimmediate solace\u201d and \u201cshare the burden of a traumatic beating,\u201d \u00b6 27. More importantly, the majority has stated the inquiry backwards: it is not whether Debra\u2019s anticipation (i.e., her <em>intention, </em>as \u201canticipation\u201d is used by the majority here) should have led her to make a sufficiently detailed statement, but rather whether her statement (and the circumstances in which it was made) should have led her to anticipate prosecutorial use thereof. As explained above, irrespective of Debra\u2019s reasons for not providing Grove with a more extensive description of what had happened at the Mizenko home that afternoon, the degree of detail in Debra\u2019s statements was sufficiently accusatorial and compelling under the circumstances (as confirmed by the prosecutor\u2019s subsequent reliance on those statements at trial) to make the statements testimonial.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">\u00b6126 In addition, the assertion that Debra \u201chad no objective reason to believe or anticipate that her statement would be used in court\u201d since she was \u201cin distress and addressing a non-governmental agent, her neighbor,\u201d \u00b6 27, is pure folly. A woman who appears on a neighbor\u2019s doorstep \u201cvisibly upset\u201d with a fresh wound on her cheek or jaw and who asks the neighbor to call 911, explaining that \u201cmy husband has been drinking and is trying to hurt me,\u201d has <em>every </em>reason to anticipate that her statements will be used in court against her husband, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>particularly when she is clearly contemplative, as was Debra: \u201cI can\u2019t do this anymore.... I want him arrested!\u201d To suggest, as does the majority, that a person such as Grove would be unaffected by the sight of a battered neighbor standing on her doorstep and take no action (such as alerting law enforcement) in the face of domestic abuse occurring just next door reflects a dim-and unjustified-view of the citizenry of this State.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">\u00b6127 The majority cites <em>Compan v. People </em>(Colo. 2005), 121 P.3d 876, as support for its position. <em>See </em>\u00b6 28. In <em>Compan, </em>however, the statements of the victim/declarant <em>(Martinez)-inter alia, </em>that her husband had hit her and that she was frightened-were made to a <em>friend </em>(Vargas) in a context that suggests Martinez reasonably expected Vargas not to repeat them; rather, the statements were made for the purpose of getting to safety and \u201cshar[ing] the burden of an emotional event.\u201d Mosteller, <em>Encouraging and Ensuring, </em>at 573. As for getting to safety, Martinez stated to Vargas over the telephone that Compan was angry and yelling at her, that she feared Compan would hit her, and that she wanted to be picked up. Martinez also asked to stay at Vargas\u2019s home. <em>See Compan, </em>121 P.3d at 877. As for sharing the burden, when Vargas picked Martinez up, Martinez prefaced her explanation of what Compan had done with \u201c \u2018Gloria, I just have to tell you what\u2019s been happening to me. I can\u2019t believe it.\u2019 \u201d <em>Compan, </em>121 P.3d at 877. By then, Compan had hit Martinez, <em>see Compan, </em>121 P.3d at 877, and she was clearly terrified of him. She asked Vargas to \u201c \u201churry, hurry. Get out of here. He\u2019s standing right there, and he might come after me.\u2019 \u201d <em>Compan, </em>121 P.3d at 878. Yet, although she was hurt, Martinez did not ask Vargas to call the police and take her to the hospital until after Martinez had calmed down, about twenty or thirty minutes after they had arrived at Vargas\u2019 home. <em>See Compan, </em>121 P.3d at 878.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">\u00b6128 By contrast, the record in the case at hand, as discussed above, establishes that Grove and Debra were not friends. Thus, this is not a case in which the declarant made statements for the purpose of sharing the burden of an emotional event with someone she could reasonably expect would keep her statements in confidence. To the contrary, Debra left evidence of the alleged assault in the house and walked over to Grove\u2019s \u201ca short time after the assault,\u201d according to the majority, <em>see </em>\u00b6 34, implying that her decision to have Mizenko arrested (because \u201cthis is ridiculous. I can\u2019t do this anymore.\u201d) was made contemporaneously with the assault and before she made her statements. Her intent, she later stated explicitly to King, was to have Mizenko arrested. Getting to safety and/or obtaining medical assistance were never mentioned. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>Consequently, <em>Compan </em>does not support the majority\u2019s conclusion that Debra\u2019s statements are nontestimonial.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">\u00b6129 Finally, relying on generalities the majority informs us that \u201ca statement made by the victim of a crime\u201d to a friend, a family member, an acquaintance, or a \u201cloose acquaintance\u201d and \u201cdescribing the crime, identifying the perpetrator or both\u201d is \u201cnontestimonial unless the declarant had clear reason to believe that [the statement] will be used prosecutorially.\u201d \u00b6 30. As support for this proposition, the majority provides a multi-page string citation. <em>See </em>\u00b6 30. Notably, none of these courts applied a \u201cclear reason to believe\u201d standard or referred to the respective declarants as \u201cloose acquaintance^],\u201d an amorphous term which the majority leaves undefined. Moreover, these cases do not stand for the majority\u2019s broad generalization that statements made to \u201cloose acquaintance[s]\u201d are nontestimonial. As explained above, the reasonable anticipation or expectation of the declarant as to whether her statement to a private party will be used for evidentiary purposes depends on the nature of the statement and the circumstances or formalities under which it was made. This conclusion flows in part from Professor Mosteller\u2019s discussion of statements made to private parties (see \u00b6 93, supra, quoting Mosteller, <em>Encouraging and Ensuring, </em>at 573), which the majority itself favorably cites (see \u00b6\u00b6 21, 27). As such, the majority\u2019s string citation only proves that under the particular circumstances in which the particular statements were made, the courts concluded that the declarants should not have anticipated prosecutorial use thereof. But even if these cases supported the majority\u2019s \u201cloose acquaintance\u201d standard, its string citation is still of minimal persuasive value. Although \u201cextant authority,\u201d \u00b6 30, in medieval Europe supported the view that the world was flat, Europeans\u2019 persistent determination in this regard did not make their belief true.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">\u00b6130 Accordingly, the majority\u2019s characterizations of Debra\u2019s statements and the circumstances under which they were made are nothing but an unrealistic assessment of what Debra should have reasonably expected (if the majority is applying an objective standard), and an inaccurate assessment of what Debra actually intended and believed (if the majority is applying a subjective standard), given the nature of her statements to Grove and the circumstances under which she made them.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b389-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>\u00b6131 As to dispatcher King\u2019s testimony, she testified to receiving a 911 call from the Grove residence at about 5:30 P.M. and to speaking with a person at that residence.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> She stated that she could not tell who was actually on the phone. Over objection, King testified that the person with whom she spoke was'\u201c[w]inded\u201d and \u201cupset\u201d and that this person \u201csaid that [Mizenko] hit her, pushed her down and she had hair \u2014 he had pullen [sic] out her hair,\u201d and that \u201c[s]he wanted him arrested.\u201d These hearsay statements were testimonial for the same reasons discussed above.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">\u00b6132 Lastly, Deputy Buennemeyer testified, over objection, and recounted Debra\u2019s statements which were made while taking the deputy around the home and pointing out evidence of the alleged assault. He testified that she told him the tufts of hair found in the house were \u201cher hair, pulled from her head, during an altercation at her residence, at that time and date.\u201d As noted above <em>(see </em>note 14), these statements fit within the category of \u201cinterrogations by law enforcement officers,\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 53, 124 S.Ct. at 1365. While we can equivocate, as did the Supreme Court, over what constitutes an \u201cinterrogation,\u201d <em>see Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 53 n.4,124 S.Ct. at 1365 n.4, it is clear that Buennemeyer asked Debra questions during his investigation, that she answered those questions, and that he gathered inculpatory evidence on the basis of those questions, all in support of the State\u2019s case, not unlike the officer who took statements from Sylvia Crawford. <em>See Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 39-40, 52-53 &amp; n.4, 124 S.Ct. at 1357, 1364-65 &amp; n.4. Thus, the statements to Buennemeyer are testimonial as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">\u00b6133 Because all of the statements at issue in the case at hand were testimonial, <em>Crawford\u2019s </em>categorical bar applies. The statements were inadmissible at Mizenko\u2019s trial unless (1) Debra was \u201cunavailable\u201d and (2) Mizenko had a prior opportunity to cross-examine her. <em>See Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 53-54, 55-56, 59, 68,124 S.Ct. at 1365, 1366-67, 1369, 1374. There is no dispute that Mizenko did not have a prior opportunity to cross-examine Debra. Accordingly, I could conclude my analysis under the \u201ctestimonial\u201d perspective of <em>Crawford </em>at this point by simply observing that the hearsay statements should not have been admitted. However, I am compelled by the manner in which the question of \u201cunavailability\u201d was handled by the District Court to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>comment on this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">4. Debra was not \u201cUnavailable\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">\u00b6134 Rule 804, M.R.Evid., defines \u201cunavailability\u201d as including situations in which the declarant \u201cis absent from the hearing and the proponent of the declarant\u2019s statement has been unable to procure the declarant\u2019s attendance by process or other reasonable means.\u201d Rule 804(a)(5), M.R.Evid. According to the United States Supreme Court, the \u201cunavailability rule\u201d requires \u201cas a predicate for introducing hearsay testimony either a showing of the declarant\u2019s unavailability or production at trial of the declarant.\u201d <em>White v. Illinois </em>(1992), 502 U.S. 346, 354 n.6, 112 S.Ct. 736, 742 n.6, 116 L.Ed.2d 848.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">\u00b6135 In the case at hand, the record establishes that the prosecutor failed to meet his burden of establishing Debra\u2019s unavailability and that the District Judge erred in not holding the prosecutor to this burden. Specifically, at the end of the State\u2019s case, defense counsel moved for a directed verdict of not guilty based on insufficient evidence. <em>Inter alia, </em>counsel correctly observed that Debra had not testified, that there was no showing that she was unavailable to testify, that the State\u2019s case was based entirely on hearsay, and that his client had been denied his right to cross-examine the State\u2019s primary witness. In response to defense counsel\u2019s objections, the prosecutor offered the following explanation for Debra\u2019s absence:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-7\">Obviously, we would like the victim here to testify, and she is under subpoena. She has not appeared and we have been trying to locate her but apparently she\u2019s unwilling to come and testify.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">End of story. The trial judge then denied defense counsel\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"AqC3\">\u00b6136 Based on Montana case law the court committed reversible error. First, the District Judge did not make any ruling that Debra was unavailable. In <em>State v. Widenhofer </em>(1997), 286 Mont. 341, 950 P.2d 1383, we included the failure to rule on unavailability as one of the bases for holding that the District Judge had abused his discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s hearsay objection. Specifically, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b390-9\">Although the District Court made inquiries as to the availability of Rothschiller, <em>the court did not make a definitive ruling in that regard </em>nor did it express a basis for denying defense counsel\u2019s objections to Officer Zarske\u2019s hearsay testimony. As a result, Widenhofer was forced to <em>\u201conly assume that the District Court implicitly ruled that Rothschiller was an unavailable witness under Rule of Evidence 804(a)(5).\u201d </em>Additionally, the State in its response brief failed to respond to Widenhofer\u2019s \u201cunavailable witness\u201d argument and, in its confusion over why the District Court admitted the testimony, ventured into the \u201cadoptive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>statement\u201d exception to the hearsay rule. <em>As set forth above, we hold that there was not a sufficient basis for applying either exception to the general rule proscribing hearsay testimony. </em>Rule 802, M.R.Evid.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b391-4\"><em>Widenhofer, </em>286 Mont. at 353, 950 P.2d at 1390 (emphases added).</p>\n<p id=\"Ae5\">\u00b6137 Second, approving the sort of <em>ad hoc </em>determination of unavailability that took place here encourages exactly the sort of conduct that the Confrontation Clause, as interpreted by <em>Crawford, </em>is designed to prevent \u2014 i.e., proof of criminal charges based on otherwise inadmissible hearsay where there has been no prior opportunity for cross-examination, where the State has made only minimal efforts to secure the attendance of the victim/witness (here, a witness who, <em>before the time of trial, </em>had recanted and was not going to support the State\u2019s case), and where the State is not held to its burden to prove unavailability by demonstrating that it made diligent efforts to secure the witness\u2019s attendance.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">\u00b6138 In <em>Widenhofer, </em>we adopted standards requiring the prosecution to bear the burden under Rule 804, M.R.Evid, \u201cto make a reasonable good faith effort to procure the attendance of a witness.\u201d <em>Widenhofer, </em>286 Mont. at 351, 950 P.2d at 1389 (citing <em>Barber v. Page </em>(1968), 390 U.S. 719, 88 S.Ct. 1318, 20 L.Ed.2d 255 (holding that the Confrontation Clause requires the prosecution to meet this burden)). We agreed that \u201csingularly unenthusiastic\u201d attempts to secure a witness\u2019s attendance did not satisfy the government\u2019s burden to show that a witness is unavailable. <em>See Widenhofer, </em>286 Mont. at 351, 950 P.2d at 1389. Rather, \u201c[t]he Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Art. II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution ... requires [sic] a greater exercise of diligence in the attempt to procure personal attendance of aprosecutionwitness.\u201d <em>Widenhofer, </em>286 Mont. at 351, 950 P.2d at 1389 (alteration and ellipsis in original). More specifically, we stated that the proponent of a witness must use \u201creasonable means\u201d to secure the witness\u2019s attendance. <em>See Widenhofer, </em>286 Mont. at 352-53, 950 P.2d at 1390.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-6\">\u00b6139 In this case, Debra sent a notarized statement to the prosecutor before trial informing him that Mizenko had not injured her in any way. Apparently believing that \u201ccourt would [not] even be held after [this] statement had been read\u201d and that, even if court were held, a \u201cjury could [not] find [Mizenko] guilty after seeing [her] true statement,\u201d Debra ignored her subpoena and did not show up at trial. Yet, despite the fact that he had a written notice from Debra <em>before trial </em>that she was recanting, the county attorney\u2019s only \u201cmeans,\u201d \u201cdiligence,\u201d and \u201cgood faith effort\u201d in procuring Debra\u2019s attendance at trial consisted of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b392-4\">Obviously, we would like the victim here to testify, and she is under subpoena. She has not appeared and we have been trying to locate her but apparently she\u2019s unwilling to come and testify.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b392-5\">If this lame excuse and showing meet the rigorous standards and burden we imposed on the State in <em>Widenhofer, </em>then, in reality, we have no standard and the State has no burden. To be intellectually honest, we should just overrule <em>Widenhofer. </em>In this case the prosecutor failed to describe how long Debra had been under subpoena; what, if anything, the State had done or was doing to locate her (especially since she had notified the prosecutor that she was recanting); how long these efforts (if any there were) had been ongoing; and what, if anything, the State had done to ensure her appearance at trial or to secure her testimony in a proceeding that would allow Mizenko\u2019s counsel to cross-examine her. <em>See </em>\u00a7 46-11-601, MCA. It can hardly be argued that Debra, the victim of the alleged assault, was not a material witness, particularly in light of the fact that the State\u2019s case depended entirely on her hearsay testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b392-6\">\u00b6140 Of course, none of these questions is answered on the record because the District Court utterly failed in its obligation to hold the State to its burden to prove Debra\u2019s unavailability and to make a definitive ruling in that regard. Granted, the court\u2019s minute entry on the morning of trial indicates that the court held Debra in contempt and ordered the sheriff to find her and deliver her to court. But this only begs the question why no reasonable efforts were made to secure the attendance of the prosecution\u2019s primary witness <em>until the morning of trial. </em>How convenient it was for the prosecution that, because of Debra\u2019s \u201capparent unwillingness\u201d to testify, it did not have to contend with her recanted testimony, it was able to introduce her unchallenged hearsay statements in the cloak of sworn testimony, and it was able, therefore, to nullify Mizenko\u2019s fundamental constitutional right to confront his accuser face to face.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> The District Court\u2019s after-the-fact sanction did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>absolutely nothing to protect Mizenko\u2019s fundamental constitutional rights of confrontation and cross-examination.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\">\u00b6141 This brings me to the second focus of <em>Crawford.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">5. <em>Crawford </em>Rejected Multi-Factored Reliability and Trustworthiness Balancing</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">\u00b6142 The <em>Crawford </em>Court did not directly rule on the vitality of the hearsay exception at issue in the case at bar-the excited utterance exception, Rule 803(2), M.R.Evid. Briefly, this hearsay exception provides that an \u201cexcited utterance\u201d is not excluded by the hearsay rule, even though the declarant is available as a witness. The Rule defines an excited utterance as \u201c[a] statement relating to a startling event or condition made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by the event or condition.\u201d Rule 803(2), M.R.Evid.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">\u00b6143 We have allowed excited utterance testimony because \u201c[t]he <em>guarantee of trustworthiness </em>is provided by the spontaneity of the statement, caused by the excitement \u2018... which temporarily stills the capacity of reflection and produces utterances free of conscious fabrication.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v.

In other words, excited utterances are the \u201cOh my God, that truck just hit that child!\u201d type of statement.

R. Evid. 804(b)(3), advisory committee\u2019s notes (\u201cThe rule defines those statements which are considered to be against interest and thus of <em>sufficient trustworthiness </em>to be admissible even though hearsay.\u201d) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> The fact that these two hearsay exceptions are both grounded in \u201cguarantees of trustworthiness\u201d is important because of how the <em>Crawford </em>Court analyzed this particular basis for admitting hearsay evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">\u00b6146 As discussed above, the Supreme Court drew two inferences <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>about the meaning of the Sixth Amendment from the common law tradition and development of the right of confrontation. First, the Court determined that the principle evil at which the Confrontation Clause was directed was the civil-law mode of criminal procedure, and particularly its use of <em>ex parte </em>examinations as evidence against the accused. Second, the Court concluded that the Framers would not have allowed admission of testimonial statements of a witness who did not appear at trial unless he was unavailable to testify and the accused had had a prior opportunity to cross-examine him.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">\u00b6147 The Court then proceeded to discuss its case law, which \u201chas been largely consistent with these two principles.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 57, 124 S.Ct. at 1367. One exception, the Court noted, was <em>White v. Illinois </em>(1992), 502 U.S. 346, 112 S.Ct. 736, 116 L.Ed.2d 848:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b395-5\">One case arguably in tension with the rule requiring a prior opportunity for cross-examination when the proffered statement is testimonial is <em>White v. Illinois, </em>502 U.S. 346 (1992), which involved, <em>inter alia, </em>statements of a child victim to an investigating police officer admitted as spontaneous declarations. It is questionable whether testimonial statements would ever have been admissible on that ground in 1791; to the extent the hearsay exception for spontaneous declarations existed at all, it required that the statements be made \u201cimmediat[ely] upon the hurt received, and before [the declarant] had time to devise or contrive any thing for her own advantage.\u201d In any case, the only question presented in <em>White </em>was whether the Confrontation Clause imposed an unavailability requirement on the types of hearsay at issue. The holding did not address the question whether certain of the statements, because they were testimonial, had to be excluded <em>even </em>if the witness was unavailable. We \u201c[took] as a given ... that the testimony properly falls within the relevant hearsay exceptions.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AB8\"><em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 58 n.8, 124 S.Ct. at 1368 n.8 (alterations in original) (citations omitted). Thus, the Court concluded, \u201c[o]ur cases have ... remained faithful to the Framers\u2019 understanding: Testimonial statements of witnesses absent from trial have been admitted only where the declarant is unavailable, and only where the defendant has had a prior opportunity to cross-examine.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 59, 124 S.Ct. at 1369.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">\u00b6148 However, while the results of the Court\u2019s decisions had generally been faithful to the original meaning of the Confrontation Clause, the same could not be said of the Court\u2019s rationales. <em>See Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 60, 124 S.Ct. at 1369. The Court noted that <em>Roberts </em>conditions the admissibility of all hearsay evidence on whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>it falls under a \u201cfirmly rooted hearsay exception\u201d or bears \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u201d <em>See Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 60, 124 S.Ct. at 1369. Because this approach departed from the historical principles discussed above, the Court criticized the test in two respects. First, the test is too broad, as it applies \u201cthe same mode of analysis whether or not the hearsay consists of <em>ex parte </em>testimony.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 60,124 S.Ct. at 1369. At the same time, the test is too narrow, in that it \u201cadmits statements that <em>do </em>consist of <em>ex parte </em>testimony upon a mere finding of reliability.\u201d <em>See Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 60, 124 S.Ct. at 1369. This \u201cmalleable standard,\u201d the Court explained, \u201coften fails to protect against paradigmatic confrontation violations.\u201d <em>See Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 60, 124 S.Ct. at 1369.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">\u00b6149 Observing that \u201cnone of the [historical] authorities discussed above acknowledges any general reliability exception to the common-law [right of confrontation],\u201d the Court expressed doubt that \u201cthe Framers meant to leave the Sixth Amendment\u2019s protection to the vagaries of the rules of evidence, much less to amorphous notions of \u2018reliability.\u2019 \u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 61, 124 S.Ct. at 1370. The Court explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-5\">[a]dmitting statements deemed reliable by a judge is fundamentally at odds with the right of confrontation. To be sure, the Clause\u2019s ultimate goal is to ensure reliability of evidence, but it is a procedural rather than a substantive guarantee. It commands, not that evidence be reliable, but that reliability be assessed in a particular manner: by testing in the crucible of cross-examination. The Clause thus reflects a judgment, not only about the desirability of reliable evidence (a point on which there could be little dissent), but about how reliability can best be determined.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b396-6\">The <em>Roberts </em>test allows a jury to hear evidence, untested by the adversary process, based on a mere judicial determination of reliability. It thus replaces the constitutionally prescribed method of assessing reliability with a wholly foreign one. In this respect, it is very different from exceptions to the Confrontation Clause that make no claim to be a surrogate means of assessing reliability[-for example, the rule of forfeiture by wrongdoing].</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AO8\"><em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 61-62,124 S.Ct. at 1370 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"AfS\">\u00b6150 It is noteworthy that the Court did not simply dismiss <em>Roberts </em>at this point as an aberration. Rather, the Court continued to lambast the <em>Roberts </em>test, focusing on its demonstrated inability to protect the right of confrontation. \u201cThe legacy <em>o\u00ed Roberts </em>in other courts vindicates the Framers\u2019 wisdom in rejecting a general reliability exception [to the right of confrontation].\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 62, 124 S.Ct. at 1371. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>\u201cReliability is an amorphous, if not entirely subjective concept\u201d; as a result, \u201c[t]he <em>[Roberts] </em>framework is so unpredictable that it fails to provide meaningful protection from even core confrontation violations.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 63,124 S.Ct. at 1371.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-4\">\u00b6 151 The Court then cited numerous examples of hearsay statements being admitted pursuant to <em>Roberts. Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 63-65, 124 S.Ct. at 1371-72. Of particular interest to the case at hand, the Colorado Supreme Court in one case<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> found a statement more reliable because it was given \u201cimmediately after\u201d the events at issue, while that same court in another case<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> found a statement more reliable because two years had elapsed. <em>See Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 63,124 S.Ct. at 1371. As these cases illustrate, the admission of hearsay statements pursuant to multi-factored reliability balancing tests is completely unpredictable-e.g., the passage of time makes a statement more reliable in one case and less reliable in another.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">\u00b6152 At this point it is necessary to digress from <em>Crawford. </em>As noted above, <em>Crawford </em>did not deal with the hearsay exception at issue here-the excited utterance exception; however, <em>White </em>did deal with this exception. Among other offenses, White was charged with and convicted of sexually assaulting a 4-year-old girl. The trial court ruled that testimony recounting the child\u2019s statements describing the crime, that was given by her babysitter, her mother, an investigating officer, an emergency room nurse, and a doctor, was admissible under the state-law hearsay exception for spontaneous declarations (and, with respect to the nurse and the doctor, also under the exception for statements made in the course of securing medical treatment). The child never testified, and the trial court made no finding as to her unavailability. White objected to the aforementioned testimony on hearsay grounds. <em>See White, </em>502 U.S. at 349-51, 112 S.Ct. at 739-40.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-6\">\u00b6153 The case worked its way to the United States Supreme Court on the issue of whether the Confrontation Clause requires that, before a trial court admits testimony under the \u201cspontaneous declaration\u201d<footnotemark>45</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>and \u201cmedical examination\u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> exceptions to the hearsay rule, the prosecution must either produce the declarant at trial or the trial court must find that the declarant is unavailable. <em>See White, </em>501 U.S. at 348-49, 112 S.Ct. at 739. In affirming the admissibility of the hearsay evidence at issue, the Court relied on <em>Roberts </em>and <em>United States v. Inadi </em>(1986), 475 U.S. 387, 106 S.Ct. 1121, 89 L.Ed.2d 390.<footnotemark>47</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Aq7\">\u00b6154 Of particular relevance to the present discussion, the Court reiterated the evidentiary rationale for permitting hearsay testimony regarding spontaneous declarations and statements made in the course of receiving medical care, as follows: \u201csuch out-of-court declarations are made in contexts that provide <em>substantial guarantees of their trustworthiness.\u201d White, </em>502 U.S. at 355, 112 S.Ct. at 742 (emphasis added). In this regard, the Court observed that these two hearsay exceptions were \u201cfirmly rooted\u2019-meaning they \u201ccarry sufficient indicia of reliability to satisfy the reliability requirement posed by the Confrontation Clause\u2019-because they were long-standing exceptions, were recognized in the Federal Rules of Evidence, and were widely accepted among the States. <em>See White, </em>502 U.S. at 355 n.8,112 S.Ct. at 742 n.8. Given that \u201ca statement that qualifies for admission under a \u2018firmly rooted\u2019 hearsay exception is so trustworthy that adversarial testing can be expected to add little to its reliability,\u201d the Court ultimately declined to \u201cexclud[e] from trial, under the aegis of the Confrontation Clause, evidence embraced within such exceptions to the hearsay rule as those for spontaneous declarations and statements made for medical treatment.\u201d <em>White, </em>502 U.S. at 357, 112 S.Ct. at 743.</p>\n<p id=\"A7M\">\u00b6155 Returning now to <em>Crawford, </em>the Supreme Court soundly and specifically rejected each of the foregoing rationales on which the <em>White </em>Court relied in upholding testimony offered under the spontaneous declaration (excited utterance) and medical examination exceptions-i.e., that these two exceptions carry sufficient indicia of reliability in that they are \u201cfirmly rooted\u201d and, therefore, that statements admitted pursuant to these exceptions are \u201cso trustworthy that adversarial testing can be expected to add little to [their] reliability.\u201d It follows, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>therefore, that hearsay evidence grounded in the excited utterance exception is inadmissible (for the purpose of establishing the truth of the matter asserted) after <em>Crawford </em>for the simple reason that the Court rejected the underpinnings of that exception-guarantees of trustworthiness.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-4\">\u00b6156 Restated, in <em>White </em>the Court observed that the admissibility of spontaneous declarations is grounded in the reliability of such statements and, in particular, their \u201csubstantial guarantees of trustworthiness.\u201d <em>See White, </em>502 U.S. at 355 &amp; n.8, 112 S.Ct. at 742 &amp; n.8. Yet, as explained in <em>Crawford, </em>the Framers rejected a general reliability exception to the right of confrontation. <em>See Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 62, 124 S.Ct. at 1371. Thus, any argument that excited utterances should be admitted on the ground that they bear \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness\u201d or fall within a \u201cfirmly rooted hearsay exception\u201d (the two ways in which an out-of-court statement may be deemed to have \u201cadequate indicia of reliability\u2019 under <em>Roberts, see Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 42, 124 S.Ct. at 1359) was completely discredited in <em>Crawford\u2019s </em>flat out rejection of this sort of approach and its overruling of the <em>Roberts </em>decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">\u00b6157 The majority agrees with this conclusion where <em>testimonial </em>statements are at issue, <em>see </em>\u00b6 31 <em>(\u201cCrawford </em>does disallow the use of hearsay exceptions based on indicia of reliability as the basis to admit hearsay statements ... in the context of testimonial statements.\u201d); but, with respect to <em>nontestimonial </em>statements, the majority claims that this dissent \u201cpaints with too broad a brush\u201d because <em>\u201cCrawford </em>does not expressly or impliedly supersede the rules of evidence as they relate to nontestimonial evidence,\u201d \u00b6 31. The majority reads <em>Crawford </em>too narrowly.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">\u00b6158 First, <em>prior </em>to setting forth the concept of a \u201ctestimonial\u201d approach to the right of confrontation, the Court expressly severed Confrontation Clause analysis from the law of evidence, which had been the approach under <em>Roberts. See Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 50-51,124 S.Ct. at 1364 (\u201c[W]e once again reject the view ... that [the Confrontation Clause\u2019s] application to out-of-court statements introduced at trial depends upon \u2018the law of Evidence for the time being.\u2019 Leaving the regulation of out-of-court statements to the law of evidence would render the Confrontation Clause powerless to prevent even the most flagrant inquisitorial practices.\u201d) (citations omitted). Thus, if we accept that the right of confrontation applies to both testimonial and nontestimonial statements-which the majority, in a moment of lucidity, does, <em>see </em>\u00b6\u00b6 32-34 (subjecting Debra\u2019s statements to Grove to federal Confrontation Clause scrutiny after concluding that those statements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>are nontestimonial) \u2014 then the majority is incorrect in its assertion that <em>Crawford </em>\u201cdoes not... supersede the rules of evidence as they relate to nontestimonial evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">\u00b6159 Second, as support for the proposition that <em>\u201cCrawford </em>does not expressly or impliedly supersede the rules of evidence as they relate to nontestimonial evidence,\u201d \u00b6 31, the majority quotes the following statement from Crawford: \u201cWhere nontestimonial hearsay is at issue, it is wholly consistent with the Framers\u2019 design to afford the States flexibility in their development of hearsay law-as does <em>Roberts, </em>and as would an approach that exempted such statements from Confrontation Clause scrutiny altogether,\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 68, 124 S.Ct. at 1374. <em>See </em>\u00b6 31. It is not clear from this language whether the Court is in fact affording the States such flexibility and suggesting two possible approaches-Ro&amp;eris, or exempting nontestimonial statements from Confrontation Clause scrutiny altogether-or whether such flexibility is the inevitable result of the <em>Crawford </em>holding to be made explicit in a subsequent opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">\u00b6160 The majority concludes that the language carries even more weight-specifically, that it <em>requires </em>courts to continue analyzing nontestimonial hearsay \u201cpursuant to the <em>Roberts </em>reliability standard\u201d until the Supreme Court \u201cexpressly overrule[s] <em>Roberts.\u201d </em>\u00b6 31. <em>See also </em>\u00b6 32. Contrary to the majority\u2019s interpretation, however, a careful reading of the sentence reveals only that <em>Roberts </em>\u201cafford[s] the States flexibility in their development of hearsay law.\u201d This is not an admonition that \u201cnontestimonial hearsay [be] analyzed pursuant to the <em>Roberts </em>reliability standard.\u201d \u00b6 31. Rather, the most that can be gleaned from the Court\u2019s language is that it was <em>not deciding </em>what approach is mandated by the Confrontation Clause with respect to nontestimonial statements. More informative in this regard is the Court\u2019s suggestion elsewhere in the <em>Crawford </em>opinion that <em>Roberts </em>actually does <em>not </em>apply to such hearsay. Specifically, the Court stated that its analysis (in Crawford) \u201ccasts doubt\u201d on the first holding of <em>White, </em>which was that the Confrontation Clause (and, thus, the <em>Roberts </em>framework itself which, at the time of <em>White, </em>was the accepted method of reviewing Confrontation Clause challenges) applies to <em>all </em>hearsay, whether testimonial or nontestimonial. <em>See Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 61, 124 S.Ct. at 1369-70; <em>White, </em>502 U.S. at 352-53, 112 S.Ct. at 740-41. In other words, it appears that the federal right of confrontation may not reach nontestimonial statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">\u00b6161 Until the Supreme Court makes such a limitation explicit, however, it is appropriate to continue applying the Clause to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>nontestimonial statements. As noted above, the majority does so, <em>see </em>\u00b6\u00b6 32-34; however, it errs in defaulting-or, perhaps more accurately, regressing-to the <em>Roberts </em>framework, <em>see </em>\u00b6\u00b6 31-33. The purported basis for its decision to do so is the following quote from <em>Agostini v. Felton </em>(1997), 521 U.S. 203, 117 S.Ct. 1997, 138 L.Ed.2d 391: \u201c[i]f a precedent of this Court has direct application in a case, yet appears to rest on reasons rejected in some other line of decisions, the Court of Appeals should follow the case which directly controls, leaving to this Court the prerogative of overruling its own decisions,\u201d 521 U.S. at 237,117 S.Ct. at 2017 (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted). <em>See </em>\u00b6 31. Applying this directive, however, first requires a determination of whether <em>Roberts </em>\u201chas direct application in\u201d or \u201cdirectly controls\u201d this case. It seems, therefore, that the majority has assumed the very conclusion it seeks to prove with the foregoing citation-i.e., that <em>Roberts </em>applies to nontestimonial statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-4\">\u00b6162 Furthermore, <em>Roberts </em>does not \u201cappearD to rest on reasons rejected in some other line of decisions\u201d; rather, <em>Roberts itself </em>was rejected, and in the <em>same </em>line of Confrontation Clause decisions. Thus, the majority\u2019s assertion that <em>Roberts </em>applies to Debra\u2019s purportedly nontestimonial statements only begs the question why <em>Roberts </em>is an adequate safeguard of the right of confrontation where nontestimonial statements are at issue, but not where testimonial statements are at issue. The <em>Roberts </em>test does not somehow become less \u201cunpredictable,\u201d \u201csubjective,\u201d and \u201camorphous,\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 63, 124 S.Ct. at 1371, and its standards do not somehow become less \u201c[vjague\u201d and \u201cmanipulable,\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 68, 124 S.Ct. at 1373, simply because the statements at issue are nontestimonial. As such, it defies logic to affirm that nontestimonial statements are subject to federal Confrontation Clause analysis but then to apply to such statements the very framework the Supreme Court rejected in <em>Crawford </em>as an inadequate safeguard of that right. To be intellectually honest in its analysis, the majority should simply concede that, in its view, nontestimonial hearsay statements are exempted from federal Confrontation Clause analysis altogether-an alternative arguably authorized by <em>Crawford, </em>as explained above; <em>see also Flores v. State </em>(Tex.App. Amarillo 2005), 170 S.W.3d 722, 725 &amp; n.l, and cases cited therein-and that Debra\u2019s statements were properly admitted because, in the majority\u2019s view, they met the requirements of a recognized hearsay exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">\u00b6163 I do not mean to suggest that I am advocating such a result. To the contrary, rather than exempting nontestimonial statements from Confrontation Clause analysis or applying the <em>Roberts </em>framework to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>such statements, I believe the proper approach is to assess the hearsay exception at issue-in this case, the excited utterance exception-in the context of, and with due respect for, <em>Crawford\u2019s </em>discussion of the failings of <em>Roberts. </em>In other words, if the basis for our not subjecting nontestimonial hearsay statements to cross-examination at trial is that we feel satisfied that the statements are sufficiently reliable and trustworthy under a \u00fcoberfe-type of multi-factored balancing-which is, in fact, the current state of affairs-then the time has come to reexamine our comfort level with this unpredictable approach, the failings of which <em>Crawford </em>(and the cases to which the Court cites in Parts V.B. and V.C. of its opinion) makes amply apparent. <em>See Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 63-67, 124 S.Ct. at 1371-73. As the Court explained, the Confrontation Clause \u201creflects a judgment, not only about the desirability of reliable evidence (a point on which there could be little dissent), but about <em>how reliability can best be determined.\u201d Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 61, 124 S.Ct. at 1370 (emphasis added). As the legacy of <em>Roberts </em>demonstrates, leaving reliability determinations to judges who perform open-ended balancing tests rather than to fact-finders who observe a witness\u2019s demeanor, body language, etc., under the rigors of cross-examination renders the right of confrontation bereft of any substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">\u00b6164 This approach is not contrary to <em>Crawford. </em>It is true that the statements at issue in that case were not nontestimonial, <em>see Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 61, 124 S.Ct. at 1370 (\u201cSylvia Crawford\u2019s statement is testimonial under any definition\u201d), but that does not mean that the rationales and reasoning of the <em>Crawford </em>opinion cannot be applied beyond the specific facts of that case. Moreover, the Court itself took the same approach with respect to the hearsay exceptions for business records and for statements in furtherance of a conspiracy, which it noted \u201ccovered statements that <em>by their nature </em>were not testimonial.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 56,124 S.Ct. at 1367 (emphasis added). In other words, the specific requirements of these particular hearsay exceptions meant that most statements within them would not meet the definition of testimonial. <em>See </em>Mosteller, <em>Encouraging and Ensuring, </em>at 547.</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">\u00b6165 Similarly, I maintain that if the rationales and requirements for admitting testimony (in a criminal trial to establish the truth of the matter asserted) pursuant to a particular hearsay exception are the same as those for which <em>Crawford </em>expressed unequivocal contempt when it comes to protecting an accused\u2019s right to confront the witnesses against him-i.e., that the out-of-court statements were \u201cmade in contexts that provide substantial guarantees of their trustworthiness,\u201d <em>White, </em>502 U.S. at 355, 112 S.Ct. at 742, and that \u201cadversarial testing can be expected to add little to [the statements\u2019] reliability,\u201d <em>White, </em>502 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>U.S. at 357,112 S.Ct. at 743-then the exception cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-4\">\u00b6166 In sum, the Confrontation Clause\u2019s \u201cultimate goal is to ensure reliability of evidence, but it is a procedural rather than a substantive guarantee. It commands, not that evidence be reliable, but that reliability be assessed in a particular manner: by testing in the crucible of cross-examination.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 61, 124 S.Ct. at 1370. <em>Roberts\u2019 </em>multi-factored balancing approach substitutes an \u201camorphous\u201d and \u201csubjective\u201d reliability test for this \u201cconstitutionally prescribed method of assessing reliability,\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 62,63,124 S.Ct. at 1370,1371; it incorporates a \u201cmalleable standard\u201d which \u201coften fails to protect against paradigmatic confrontation violations,\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 60, 124 S.Ct. at 1369; it establishes a general reliability exception not recognized in the common-law right of confrontation; and, in so doing, it departs from the historical principles on which the Confrontation Clause is grounded.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">\u00b6167 For these reasons, <em>Roberts\u2019 </em>multi-factored balancing approach must be rejected as a safeguard of an accused\u2019s right of confrontation; and statements admitted pursuant to the excited utterance hearsay exception-because they depend for their admission on the same notions of reliability that underlie the <em>Roberts </em>framework-must be barred at trial, unless the declarant is unavailable and the defendant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine her. The facts of the case at bar prove the legitimacy of the concerns articulated by the <em>Crawford </em>Court. It is to that aspect of this case that I now turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">\u00b6168 At the outset, it is important to note that the evidence that Mizenko had assaulted Debra was disputed; in other words, this is not a case where the evidence of the assault was uncontradicted. Furthermore, the State relied almost entirely (particularly regarding the identity of the perpetrator of Debra\u2019s injuries) on Grove\u2019s, King\u2019s, and Buennemeyer\u2019s testimony, which repeated Debra\u2019s hearsay statements accusing Mizenko of the assault. Indeed, the prosecutor summed up the case as follows: \u201cSo given all the evidence, I told you it\u2019s a simple case. It is. If you believe <em>what [Debra] told people that night, </em>you need to find him guilty. Thank you.\u201d (Emphasis added.) In addition, Deputy Buennemeyer conceded that other than what he had heard from Debra and from the dispatcher (hearsay within hearsay), he could not tell whether the hair which was entered in evidence came from Debra brushing her hair (as testified to by Mizenko) or from being pulled out. \u00b6169 Thus, the hearsay statements supported the State\u2019s theory of the crime, and that was the only reason they were offered-as evidence of Mizenko\u2019s commission of the facts proving he assaulted Debra. That theory was disputed not only by Mizenko (who claimed that there was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>no physical assault, only a verbal argument) but also by Debra, who had changed her story and had so informed the prosecutor in writing prior to the commencement of the trial. <em>See </em>note 5, <em>supra.</em><footnotemark><em>48</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Axh\">\u00b6170 This is a perfect example of why \u201cthe right of confrontation and cross-examination is an essential and fundamental requirement for the kind of fair trial which is this country\u2019s constitutional goal.\u201d <em>Pointer v. Texas </em>(1965), 380 U.S. 400, 405, 85 S.Ct. 1065, 1068, 13 L.Ed.2d 923. It is why \u201c[c]ross-examination is the hallmark of our system of justice\u201d-\u201cit produces truth\u201d through \u201c[s]uch things as the demeanor of a witness, his or her body language, and a witness\u2019s hesitancy in giving testimony, [which] often communicate as much to the fact-finder as the spoken words.\u201d <em>State v. Clark, </em>1998 MT 221, \u00b6 23, 290 Mont. 479, \u00b6 23, 964 P.2d 766, \u00b6 23. It is why in Montana the accused has the fundamental constitutional right to confront his accuser \u201cface to face.\u201d Art. II, Sec. 24, Mont. Const. It is why the constitutionally prescribed method of assessing the reliability of hearsay evidence is not a multifactored, open-ended balancing test, but rather confrontation and cross-examination. <em>See Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 61-62,124 S.Ct. at 1370.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">\u00b6171 Nevertheless, the District Court admitted Debra\u2019s statements through Grove, King, and Buennemeyer under the excited utterance exception. In affirming this ruling, the majority relies in part on <em>State v. Cameron, </em>2005 MT 32, 326 Mont. 51, 106 P.3d 1189 (see \u00b6 33); but <em>Cameron </em>actually demonstrates why admitting hearsay statements on the basis of their \u201creliability\u201d and \u201ctrustworthiness\u201d was soundly rejected in <em>Crawford.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">\u00b6172 In <em>Cameron, </em>the trial record was silent as to why the prosecutor offered the victim\u2019s statement and as to why the court admitted it. <em>Cameron, </em>\u00b6 31. On appeal, the State came up with the theory that the victim\u2019s statement had been an excited utterance. We<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> agreed and affirmed the District Court for reaching the right result, though for an unspecified reason. <em>See Cameron, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 31-35, 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">\u00b6173 Historically, the excited utterance exception admitted statements made <em>\u201cimmediately] </em>upon the hurt received, and before [the declarant] had time to devise or contrive any thing for her own <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>advantage.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 58 n.8, 124 S.Ct. at 1368 n.8 (alterations in original) (emphasis added) (internal quotation marks omitted). <em>See also State v.

Caryl </em>(1975), 168 Mont. 414, 431, 543 P.2d 389, 398 (\u201cDeclarations made while the mind of the speaker is laboring under the excitement aroused by the accident, <em>before there was time to reflect and fabricate, </em>....\u201d) (emphasis added); 6 Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 1749, at 199 (Chadbourn rev. 1976) (\u201cThe utterance, it is commonly said, must be \u2018spontaneous,\u2019 \u2018natural,\u2019 \u2018impulsive,\u2019 \u2018instinctive,\u2019 \u2018generated by an excited feeling which extends without let or breakdown from the moment of the event they illustrate.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b405-4\">\u00b6174 For instance, in In <em>re S.M., </em>2001 MT 11, 304 Mont. 102, 19 P.3d 213, we affirmed the admission of a five-year-old declarant\u2019s hearsay statement (that she was frightened upon seeing her abuser) because the statement \u201crelated to a startling event-suddenly being confronted by [her abuser],\u201d <em>S.M., </em>\u00b6 24; and she made it <em>\u201cupon </em>seeing\u201d her abuser, <em>S.M., </em>\u00b6 24 (emphasis added), <em>\u201cwhile </em>she was perceiving [the] startling event and <em>while </em>she was under the stress of the excitement caused by that event,\u201d <em>S.M., </em>\u00b6 22 (emphases added), and <em>\u201cbefore [she] had time to reflect,\u201d S.M., </em>\u00b6 24 (emphasis added). (We also found the statement to be admissible under the present sense impression and the then-existing mental, emotional, or physical condition exceptions. <em>See S.M., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 23-24.) By contrast, the <em>Cameron </em>Court determined that a statement made <em>an hour or two </em>after an alleged assault qualified as an excited utterance. This conclusion was justified by \u201c[flurther circumstances,\u201d which the Court deemed \u201crelevant to resolution of this issue\u201d-in particular, the declarant \u201cwept from the moment she left [the defendant\u2019s trailer] until well after she uttered the hearsay statement,\u201d and, as she arrived home, the declarant \u201cshowed no sign of diminished excitement.\u201d <em>Cameron, </em>\u00b6 34.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">\u00b6175 While these \u201c[flurther circumstances\u201d may indeed suggest that the declarant was \u201cstill laboring under the stress of excitement caused by the attack,\u201d <em>Cameron, </em>\u00b6 34, they cannot be allowed to eclipse the crucial factor respecting the trustworthiness of excited utterances: time to reflect and fabricate. After the alleged attack, the declarant \u201chad to travel roughly eight miles on foot\u201d for \u201can hour or two.\u201d <em>Cameron, </em>\u00b6 33. To assert that her capacity to reflect on the attack was stilled during this entire walk/run is disingenuous. Undoubtedly, she was upset during this period, but this fact does not establish that her statements <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>were in fact free of conscious fabrication.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">\u00b6176 The Court also cited with approval various excited utterance cases from other jurisdictions that allowed statements made \u201cup to three and a half hours,\u201d \u201ctwo to three hours,\u201d \u201chours,\u201d and \u201cone to several hours\u201d after the respective incidents. <em>See Cameron, </em>\u00b6 36. Yet, this only further illustrates the Court\u2019s either/or approach to excited utterances: an excited utterance is trustworthy if the statement was made <em>either </em>while the mind of the speaker is laboring under the excitement aroused by the accident <em>or </em>before there was time to reflect and fabricate. Contrary to <em>Cameron, </em>however, these two requirements are conjunctive, not disjunctive. <em>See Hamby, </em>\u00b6 26; <em>Caryl, </em>168 Mont. at 431, 543 P.2d at 398. As a result, <em>Cameron </em>cuts the excited utterance exception loose from its moorings.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">\u00b6177 The fact is that there is nothing \u201cimmediate\u201d or \u201cspontaneous\u201d about the statements made in <em>Cameron </em>and in the cases on which it relies, and the same is true of the case at bar. As described above, Grove testified that she observed the Mizenkos arrive by car at their home at approximately 4:00 P.M. and that at approximately 5:00 P.M., Debra appeared at her door, with a large dog, \u201cvisibly upset\u201d and with a wound on her cheek or jaw. Grove had no recollection of Debra crying. Grove testified that \u201c[Debra] asked me to call 911, and Carol Richard, she said that her husband had been drinking and was trying to hurt her.\u201d The majority finds it sufficient that these statements to Grove were made \u201ca short time\u201d after the startling event, \u00b6 34; however, the record establishes that the alleged assault occurred <em>up to 60 minutes </em>prior to Debra\u2019s statements to Grove, and there is no evidence that Debra\u2019s capacity for reflection was stilled during this entire time. 911 operator King, for her part, testified that the person with whom she spoke \u201csaid that [Mizenko] hit her, pushed her down and ... had pullen [sic] out her hair,\u201d and that \u201c[s]he wanted him arrested.\u201d This \u201cexcited utterance\u201d testimony was relayed to King at about 5:30 P.M. And <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>Buennemeyer recounted Debra\u2019s \u201cexcited utterances\u201d that had occurred even later still and included her taking the deputy around the home and \u201cexcited[ly]\u201d pointing out evidence of the alleged assault. By this time, however, Debra clearly had had plenty of time to \u201cdevise or contrive\u201d her statements. I do not mean to suggest that she-or the declarant in <em>Cameron, </em>for that matter-in fact did so. Indeed, whether or not Debra contrived her statements is something that should have been probed <em>by Mizenko </em>while Debra was under oath and subject to cross-examination. It is not for the District Judge or for this Court to make the determination that Debra\u2019s statements were not contrived, which is the point of this discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-4\">\u00b6178 Thus, Debra\u2019s statements were not \u201cexcited utterances,\u201d at least not within the meaning historically-and logically-ascribed to that term. Nevertheless, the majority claims otherwise, explaining that \u201ca lapse of time is not determinative of whether [the stress of excitement caused by a startling event] has subsided.\u201d \u00b6 33. This explanation misses the point; the question is not whether, at the time she made the statements to Grove, sufficient time had elapsed such that Debra no longer labored under the stress of excitement caused by the startling event (the alleged assault), but rather whether Debra\u2019s capacity for reflection was stilled during the entire period between the startling event and the making of the statements, such that the statements were \u201cmade under the immediate and uncontrolled domination of the senses [by the stress of nervous excitement], and during the brief period when considerations of self-interest could not have been brought fully to bear by reasoned reflection.\u201d 6 Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 1747, at 195 (Chadbourn rev. 1976). While Debra and the victim in <em>Cameron </em>may have been upset, there is no evidence that they did not engage in reflective thought prior to making the statements at issue; clearly, they each had ample time to do so. <em>Cameron </em>was wrongly decided.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">\u00b6179 Be that as it may, the point to be made is this: different courts-and even different judges on the same court (as the foregoing discussions of <em>Cameron </em>and the case at hand illustrate)-often reach different reliability determinations on the same facts. This is the inevitable result of admitting hearsay testimony pursuant to an unpredictable reliability test. \u201cReliability is an amorphous, if not entirely subjective, concept. There are countless factors bearing on whether a statement is reliable.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 63,124 S.Ct. at 1371. The right of confrontation cannot be left to the vagaries of such a system.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">\u00b6180 All of Debra\u2019s statements were admitted under a hearsay exception, the underpinnings of which-reliability and trustworthiness <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>balancing-the Supreme Court condemned in <em>Crawford. </em>Mizenko was denied his fundamental right to a fair trial because the State was allowed to build its case on hearsay evidence that was not tested \u201cin the crucible of cross-examination\u201d and by \u201cthe adversary process,\u201d but rather was based on \u201ca mere judicial determination of reliability.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 61, 62, 124 S.Ct. at 1370. Because the District Court dispensed with confrontation on the premise that the excited utterance testimony was obviously reliable, the court effectively dispensed with the trial because Mizenko was obviously guilty. <em>See Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 62, 124 S.Ct. at 1371 (\u201cDispensing with confrontation because testimony is obviously reliable is akin to dispensing with jury trial because a defendant is obviously guilty.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"Acq\">\u00b6181 Indeed, in summarily denying Mizenko\u2019s motion to dismiss, the District Court actually did find the defendant guilty. Specifically, the judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-4\"><em>The Court would find that there is proof beyond a reasonable doubt that there was an injury that she suffered and that the Defendant did it. </em>Obviously, when a victim does not appear, you are unable to confront her, but you certainly questioned those people who had contact with her, and whether you planted that out in a juror\u2019s mind. So the Court finds there is a basis for the matter to proceed. We will deny the motion and we will send the case to the jury. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">Mizenko had not even put on his case, yet the court had already found him guilty on the basis of \u201creliable\u201d and \u201ctrustworthy\u201d excited utterances that had not been subjected to any adversarial testing whatsoever. And, to add insult to injury, the judge\u2019s observation that Mizenko \u201ccertainly questioned those people who had contact with [Debra]\u201d is about as reassuring as telling Raleigh that he was \u201cperfectly free to confront those who read Cobham\u2019s confession in court.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 51,124 S.Ct. at 1364. \u201cThis is not what the Sixth Amendment prescribes.\u201d <em>Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 62, 124 S.Ct. at 1371. Nor does Article II, Section 24, of the Montana Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">\u00b6182 Except for the photograph of the slight bruise on Debra\u2019s chin, the entirety of the State\u2019s case was based on out-of-court statements which were testimonial. Conveniently, Debra\u2019s contrary statements contained in her notarized letter to the prosecutor were kept from the jury (despite the jurors\u2019 request to include those statements in their deliberations). Because Mizenko did not at any time have an opportunity to cross-examine Debra as to her statements to Grove, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>King, and Buennemeyer, and because Debra was not \u201cunavailable\u201d for trial, the statements should not have been admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\">\u00b6183 Furthermore, Debra\u2019s statements were admitted pursuant to a hearsay exception under which the trustworthiness of her statements was assessed by a judge performing a multi-factored, open-ended balancing test (\u00e1 la the <em>Roberts </em>framework). The Supreme Court, however, condemned this malleable approach, grounded in amorphous notions of \u201creliability,\u201d in <em>Crawford. </em>Thus, testimony proffered by the prosecution pursuant to hearsay exceptions that owe their existence to that same malleable standard-such as the excited utterance exception-must be rejected, unless the declarant is unavailable in the legal sense and there was a prior opportunity for cross-examination by the defendant. For this reason as well, Debra\u2019s out-of-court statements should not have been admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">\u00b6184 Instead, Mizenko was denied his right to confront his accuser face to face and to cross-examine the State\u2019s primary witness because the State did nothing to ensure her presence at trial. Mizenko was convicted on hearsay testimony that was untested in the crucible of cross-examination and by the adversary process. He was convicted on evidence, the reliability of which was based on a judicial determination and which the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment and Article II, Section 24, were meant to exclude.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">\u00b6185 Seeking to justify the District Court\u2019s denial of Mizenko\u2019s right of confrontation in a trial which took place pr <em>e-Crawford,</em><footnotemark><em>51</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the majority signals its approval of similar violations in <em>post-Crawford </em>trials. Yet, it is entirely plausible that if Mizenko\u2019s trial had taken place post-<em>Crawford, </em>the prosecutor would have made greater efforts to procure the attendance of Debra at trial or to provide Mizenko with an opportunity to cross-examine her hearsay statements during a pre-trial proceeding, such as a deposition or a preliminary hearing. For this reason, we should not decide <em>Crawford </em>challenges with a backward-looking perspective, seeking to uphold convictions based on inadmissible testimonial statements because the prosecutors and District Judges in those cases followed a set of practices designed to meet a different standard. <em>See </em>Mosteller, <em>Encouraging and Ensuring, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>at 517.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> By doing so, the majority countenances the continued use of such statements and unconstitutional procedures in post <em>-Crawford </em>trials. We have previously held that new rules of constitutional criminal procedure apply to all cases which are on direct appeal at the time the new rule is announced. <em>See State v. Carter, </em>2005 MT 87, \u00b6 18, 326 Mont. 427, \u00b6 18, 114 P.3d 1001, \u00b6 18. To be faithful to this principle, we must decide this case unimpeded by the fact that the prosecutor and the District Judge were not aware of <em>Crawford\u2019s </em>mandates at the time of Mizenko\u2019s trial. Based upon the foregoing analysis, I would reverse Mizenko\u2019s conviction and remand this case to the District Court for retrial with instructions that the hearsay statements at issue here be excluded, unless Debra is \u201cunavailable\u201d for trial and Mizenko is given a prior opportunity to cross-examine her.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-4\">\u00b6186 Justice Warner\u2019s concurrence, though well-intentioned, is fundamentally flawed for four reasons. First, my colleague makes much of the interests of crime victims, stating that the dissent \u201cfails to give sufficient consideration\u201d to those interests. Yet, he cites no constitutional provision guaranteeing a victim the right not to testify against the accused. Indeed, the constitutional provisions at issue here \u2014 and in criminal cases generally \u2014 are restraints on the power of the State in its prosecutions of crimes. As such, they are safeguards afforded <em>persons accused of crimes. </em>While it is a hard and often bitter reality, the Constitution does not confer upon victims of crimes any explicit rights; at the very least, it cannot be said that the Constitution guarantees victims the right to \u201cvictimless\u201d prosecutions based on hearsay testimony <em>(see </em>note 1, <em>supra). </em>To be sure, crime victims justifiably deserve the support and protection of the government, and the Legislature accordingly has provided them with a number of statutory rights. <em>See, e.g., </em>Title 46, Chapter 24, Montana Code Annotated (Treatment of Victims and Witnesses); Title 46, Chapter 6, Part 6, Montana Code Annotated (Domestic Violence Provisions); \u00a7 46-18-236, MCA (funding of services to crime victims). However, these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>statutory rights may not supersede the constitutional protections guaranteed to persons prosecuted for criminal offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">\u00b6187 Second, the concurrence states that \u201can accused must not be allowed to hide behind the Constitution by intimidating witnesses.\u201d Obviously, if the accused has, in fact, intimidated a witness, that conduct in and of itself constitutes a crime. <em>See </em>\u00a7 45-7-206, MCA. The Constitution and the Confrontation Clause do not prevent the accused from being charged with and prosecuted for such criminal conduct. Moreover, in such circumstances, the rule of forfeiture by wrongdoing would extinguish any confrontation claim he might raise. <em>See Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 62, 124 S.Ct. at 1370 (One exception to the Confrontation Clause, \u201cthe rule of forfeiture by -wrongdoing (which we accept)[,] extinguishes confrontation claims on essentially equitable grounds.\u201d). More to the point, however, the accused is allowed to \u201chide behind\u201d the Constitution-or, more properly, he is allowed to exercise his constitutional rights. That is precisely why such rights were enshrined in the Constitution. In point of fact, the accused is guaranteed the right to \u201chide behind\u201d the Fourth Amendment to the Federal Constitution and Article II, Sections 10 and 11, of the Montana Constitution if he is the subject of an unreasonable search and seizure; he is guaranteed the right to \u201chide behind\u201d the Fifth Amendment and Article II, Section 25, if he is compelled to incriminate himself; he is guaranteed the right to \u201chide behind\u201d the Sixth Amendment and Article II, Section 24, if he is deprived of his right to the effective assistance of counsel; and he, most certainly, is guaranteed the right to \u201chide behind\u201d the Sixth Amendment and Article II, Section 24, if he is denied his right to confront his accusers. These protections are not subject to exception simply because we believe the defendant is a bad guy or because we feel compassion for the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">\u00b6188 Third, the concurrence rallies behind law enforcement and prosecutors. Again, the reality is that law enforcement and prosecutors are in the business of obtaining convictions through the criminal justice system. That is properly their job, and I take no issue with that, contrary to the concurrence\u2019s implication. However, our job is to uphold the law and the Constitution. And there is the rub. To the extent that this Court, or any other court, punches loopholes of convenience in the constitutional rights of persons accused of crimes, we must expect that those loopholes will be utilized by professionals in the competitive enterprise of ferreting out and prosecuting crime. To believe otherwise is pure naivet\u00e9. As demonstrated above, law enforcement and prosecutors already are conducting \u201cvictimless\u201d prosecutions and are modifying their evidence-gathering techniques to avoid the impact of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number><em>Crawford. See </em>notes 1 &amp; 2, <em>supra. </em>That is why this case is before us. It is simply a fact of life: \u201cIf the courts allow it, they will come.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\">\u00b6189 And that brings me to my fourth and final point. There runs through the concurrence the theme that \u201cthe ends justify the means.\u201d Domestic abuse is a very bad thing, so it is acceptable to maintain prosecutions \u201cif witnesses, for whatever reason, do not appear at trial,\u201d as the concurring Justice puts it. While currently popular among many elected officials, this mindset is precisely what our federal and state constitutions were written to prohibit. It is remarkably easy to justify ignoring a person\u2019s constitutional rights when there is a perceived \u201cgreater good\u201d to be served. Facile arguments can always be advanced to obviate applying the law and upholding the Constitution in challenging, disgusting, and sometimes heartbreaking circumstances. This approach, however, rings hollow. If we are to be a State and nation truly committed to the rule of law, then our constitutions must continue to serve as a shield against this philosophy of expedience.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">\u00b6190 No doubt, victim advocates, law enforcement, prosecutors, and others will consider the majority opinion a great victory in the battle against domestic abuse and assault. Unfortunately, however, when this Court diminishes the fundamental constitutional rights of any given defendant, it concomitantly diminishes those same rights for every other person in this State. I am deeply sympathetic with the problem of domestic abuse and those who suffer from it; yet, denying to those accused of these crimes one of the most fundamental and cherished of our constitutional rights-the right to confront and cross-examine one\u2019s accuser face to face-is not the answer, particularly since the right of confrontation and the prosecutorial use of a victim\u2019s out-of-court statements are not incompatible. <em>See </em>Mosteller, <em>Encouraging and Ensuring, </em>at 520 (As to declarants \u201csuch as domestic violence victims who frequently become unavailable or uncooperative at trial, the [confrontation] right and admissibility may both be met by greater efforts to afford confrontation at early adversarial hearings, such as preliminary examinations and depositions.\u201d); Mosteller, <em>Encouraging and Ensuring, </em>at 610 (\u201cIn domestic violence cases, instead of the prosecution attempting to secure more victim testimony, another approach is likely to be more effective. This approach creates opportunities for testimony by the victim at the outset of the prosecution, when she may be a more willing witness, with a right of cross-examination by the defendant.\u201d).

Professor King-Ries explains that when victims of domestic abuse refuse to testify against their abusers, prosecutors often proceed with \u201cvictimless\u201d prosecutions, which he characterizes as \u201ca creative, resourceful, and effective response\u201d to the dynamics of domestic violence. <em>See King-Ries, </em>at 301,305-06,327. In a victimless prosecution, the victim does not testify; rather, the prosecution is based largely on the admission of the victim\u2019s out-of-court statements as excited utterances (as in the case at hand), present sense impressions, or statements to medical personnel. <em>See King-Ries, </em>at 301, 308-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">Professor King-Ries advocates \u201ccarefully constru[ing]\u201d the definition of <em>Crawford\u2019s </em>\u201ctestimonial\u201d concept in the domestic violence context so as to permit the continued use of excited utterances, present sense impressions, and statements to medical personnel in victimless prosecutions and, thereby, to preserve \u201cthe strength of victimless prosecutions.\u201d <em>See King-Ries, </em>at 326-28. He submits that if it were no longer possible to prosecute a domestic abuse case in the victim\u2019s absence, prosecutors would be \u201cpowerless to address a significant portion of domestic violence crimes,\u201d <em>King-Ries, </em>at 328, and defendants would \u201cprofit from [their] own misdeeds because the domestic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>violence victim is generally absent from trial due to the defendant\u2019s action or threatened action,\u201d <em>King-Ries, </em>at 325. (Of course, as will be explained below, it is not necessary for the victim to testify <em>at trial, </em>as long as she is unavailable in the legal sense and the defendant has had a prior opportunity to cross-examine her-for instance, at a pre-trial proceeding such as a deposition or a preliminary hearing. Furthermore, if the victim\u2019s absence from trial were due to threats by the defendant of repercussions should the victim appear and testify against him, then his right to confront the victim would be extinguished on equitable grounds. <em>See Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 62, 124 S.Ct. at 1370 (\u201c[T]he rule of forfeiture by wrongdoing (which we accept) extinguishes confrontation claims on essentially equitable grounds.\u201d).)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b344-5\"> <em>See </em>Robert P.

I was not injured. The rugburn on my chin was a result of playing w/the dog.\u201d In an attached letter, she referred to an \u201cinebriated recording\u201d (presumably her tape-recorded statements to the 911 operator) and conveyed surprise that Mizenko had been convicted in spite of her \u201ctrue\u201d notarized statement: \u201cI still cannot believe the jury could find him guilty after <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>seeing my true statement. I did not think that court would even be held after the statement had been read.\u201d (According to the record, the jury asked during deliberations to see the letter Debra had written to the prosecutor, but the District Court denied the jury\u2019s request.)

Indeed, he acknowledged this fact dining his closing argument: \u201cDid I want Mrs. Mizenko here to testify, you bet I did. Did I suspect what she might have told you, yeah, I suspect what she might have told us. But you know at the time she went over to Dawn Grove\u2019s house, and we are going to send a tape back in with you to listen to, it had just happened and what she told Dawn Grove, is what [Mizenko] did.\u201d Hence, rather than having to persuade the jury to believe one of two conflicting versions of the events of October 3, 2003, the prosecution was able to supply the jury-unhampered by contrary testimony-with the one version that supported its case. The jury never had to assess which version was more reliable; the District Court, in overruling Mizenko\u2019s hearsay objections, did that for them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b346-7\"><em> See </em>\u00a7\u00a7 3-l-501(l)(j) and 45-7-309(l)(c), MCA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b347-8\"> This is especially true of domestic violence cases. \u201cAs jurisdictions implemented policy judgments that abusers should be arrested and prosecuted in domestic violence cases regardless of the wishes of the immediate victim, prosecutors developed methods for \u2018victimless\u2019 prosecutions.

As noted above (see note 15), we explained in <em>Carter </em>that the Intoxilizer 5000 certification reports \u201care not substantive evidence of a particular offense, but rather are foundational evidence necessary for the admission of substantive evidence. In other words, the certification reports are nontestimonial in nature in that they are foundational, rather than substantive or accusatory.\u201d <em>Carter, </em>\u00b6 32. Not surprisingly, therefore, Mizenko proffers that all out-of-court statements are \u201ctestimonial\u201d if they are (1) substantive and (2) accusatorial. <em>See </em>\u00b6 12. The majority rejects this formulation as \u201coverly broad\u201d because <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>\u201cit would require courts to exclude more evidence than the Sixth Amendment requires.\u201d \u00b6 12. We are not immediately told what makes Mizenko\u2019s formulation \u201coverly broad\u201d-perhaps it is the substantive prong, perhaps it is the accusatorial prong, perhaps it is both prongs, or perhaps it is their simultaneous application-however, the majority enlightens us later in the opinion where it states that \u201cthe author of the certification report\u201d was not a \u201c \u2018witnessD against\u2019 \u201d Carter and then reiterates that the certification reports at issue in <em>Carter </em>were nontestimonial \u201cbecause \u2018not substantive evidence of a particular offense.\u2019 \u201d \u00b6 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-5\">Hence, three explanations have been proffered for why the certification reports were found to be nontestimonial in <em>Carter. </em>(1) they are foundational, not substantive, evidence of a particular offense, (2) they are not accusatorial in nature, and (3) the person making the statements reflected by the certification reports is not a witness \u201cagainst\u201d the defendant. As to the first theory, Black\u2019s defines \u201csubstantive evidence\u201d as \u201c[ejvidence offered to help establish a fact in issue, as opposed to evidence directed to impeach or to support a witness\u2019s credibility.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 599-600 (8th ed. 2004). While the majority\u2019s theory (that an out-of-court statement is nontestimonial when offered for a purpose other than to establish a fact in issue) is \u201cappealing in its clarity and ease of application,\u201d \u00b6 12, a more exhaustive analysis of <em>Crawford </em>and the right of confrontation than we found necessary to conduct in <em>Carter </em>reveals that the \u201ctestimonial\u201d inquiry does not depend on whether the statement at issue is offered to establish a fact in issue. There is no indication in <em>Crawford </em>that a statement is exempted from Confrontation Clause scrutiny if it is used foundationally to establish the admissibility of other evidence. Rather, the question of whether a \u201ctestimonial\u201d inquiry is necessary turns on whether the out-of-court statement is offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. <em>See Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 60 n.9, 124 S.Ct. at 1369 n.9 (\u201cThe Clause... does not bar the use of testimonial statements for purposes other than establishing the truth of the matter asserted.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-6\">Furthermore, the majority cites no post <em>-Crawford </em>authority for its theory other than <em>Carter </em>which, as explained above (see note 15), relied on <em>pre-Crawford </em>Montana law in defining \u201ctestimonial\u201d for purposes of the statements at issue. <em>See Carter, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 32, 34. Granted, the majority analogizes the Intoxilizer 5000 certification reports to business records, immigration records, and medical records. <em>See </em>\u00b6 22. However, the reason such records are nontestimonial in a run-of-the-mill case is not because they are \u201cnot substantive evidence of a particular offense,\u201d which in many cases they are. Rather, it is because the \u201cnature\u201d of such statements places them in the nontestimonial category. <em>See Crawford, </em>541 U.S. at 56, 124 S.Ct. at 1367. Professor Mosteller ably explains this distinction as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-7\">[Tjhere is no theoretical basis to assume that, simply because a statement falls within a modern-day hearsay exception, it was intended to be excluded from protection under the Confrontation Clause if that particular statement has testimonial characteristics. Rather, the Court\u2019s treatment [of several hearsay exceptions in <em>Crawford </em>as non-testimonial] probably was meant to say that, because of <em>the specific requirements of the particular hearsay exceptions, </em>most statements within them would not meet the testimonial definition....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-8\">An examination of business records and statements in furtherance of a conspiracy is helpful in suggesting an important indicator of when statements are non-testimonial and which particular statements, even though falling within a modern hearsay exception, should be treated as testimonial. That indicator is whether the statement is made for the purpose of accusing, or whether it is made for another purpose associated with other ordinary human activities.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b369-9\">Some business records may concern matters that are understood at the time they were made to be destined for litigation or may be clearly accusatory. However, at their core, they involve employees, who are recording matters that are ordinary, routine, and related to performing their job functions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b369-10\">Mosteller, <em>Encouraging and Ensuring, </em>at 546, 547-48 (emphasis added) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b369-11\">The cases cited by the majority <em>(see </em>\u00b6 22) support Mosteller\u2019s interpretation. <em>See U.S. v.

Garner </em>(6th Cir. 2005), 148 Fed.Appx. 269, 270, 274 (unpublished) (\u201c[T]he [medical] records at issue were prepared at Garner\u2019s request and were submitted by her in order to obtain benefits. The physicians involved were not preparing their reports in the context of a criminal prosecution [for mail fraud, making false statements to obtain federal employees\u2019 compensation, and making false statements to obtain Social Security disability benefits], and had no reason to \u2018anticipate [their] statements being used against [Gamer] in investigating and prosecuting the crime.\u2019 \u201c) (some alterations in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">As noted above, the majority offers an additional explanation for why the Intoxilizer 5000 certification reports\u201d were nontestimonial: \u201cthe author of the certification reports\u201d was not a \u201c \u2018witness!] against\u2019 \u201d Carter because \u201chearsay provided for foundational purposes is not evidence \u2018against\u2019 the defendant.\u201d \u00b6 22. It is highly doubtful that Carter considered the author of the certification report to be a witness <em>for </em>him; thus, the majority has created a new class of \u201cneutral\u201d prosecutorial witnesses who are not subject to Confrontation Clause scrutiny-perhaps because their out-of-court statements are \u201cso trustworthy that adversarial testing can be expected to add little to [their] reliability,\u201d <em>White, </em>502 U.S. at 357,112 S.Ct. at 743. Yet, the majority\u2019s theory presupposes that there is no way to effectively cross-examine evidence offered for foundational purposes, an assertion belied by the fact of Carter\u2019s appeal. Moreover, all evidence offered by the prosecution at trial-even evidence to establish the competence and credibility of its witnesses-is for the purpose of obtaining a conviction; if not, the evidence is likely irrelevant. The majority provides neither authority nor reasoning for the proposition that evidence of a prosecution witness\u2019s (e.g., the Intoxilizer 5000's) competence is not evidence \u201cagainst\u201d the accused as that term is used in the Sixth Amendment, and <em>Carter </em>was not written with this characterization in mind. Rather, the opinion reflects our judgment, based on <em>State v. Delaney, </em>1999 MT 317, 297 Mont. 263, 991 P.2d 461, that \u201cthe certification reports are nontestimonial in nature in that they are foundational, rather than substantive or accusatory.\u201d <em>Carter, </em>\u00b6 32. As explained above, the foundational/substantive distinction does not find support in the history and formulations set forth in <em>Crawford, </em>which suggests that the remaining theory-that the statements are not accusatory in nature-provides the proper basis for our holding in <em>Carter.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">But even if we accepted the majority\u2019s theory that \u201chearsay provided for foundational purposes is not evidence \u2018against\u2019 the defendant,\u201d \u00b6 22, the reason such statements would not be evidence \u201cagainst\u201d an accused is that they are not of an accusatory nature. Specifically, the statements represented by the certification reports, which were offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted (i.e., that the Intoxilizer 5000 functioned properly), did not accuse Carter-or anyone else, for that matter-of something unlawful. Rather, they related only to the machine\u2019s operation. <em>See Delaney, </em>\u00b6 18 (distinguishing an annual certification form for the Intoxilizer 5000, which was used for foundational purposes in <em>Delaney, </em>from a report of the chemical analysis of drugs, which was used substantively in <em>State v. Clark, </em>1998 MT 221, 290 Mont. 479, 964 P.2d 766, on the ground that \u201c[t]he information in the annual certification form was <em>not accusatory </em>in the same manner as the chemical analysis in <em>Clark\u201d) </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-7\">Accordingly, the most plausible explanation for why, under <em>Crawford, </em>the certification reports at issue in <em>Carter </em>were nontestimonial is that the statements represented by those reports-which, as the majority observes, were made in anticipation of prosecutorial use at trial, <em>see </em>\u00b6 22-were not of an accusatory nature. <em>See Carter, </em>\u00b6 32. <em>See also </em>Mosteller, <em>Encouraging and Ensuring, </em>at 575 (\u201cAs to all hearsay statements, those made for purposes other than testimony, or more generally prosecutorial court use, or <em>those that are non-accusatory, </em>can properly be excluded from a testimonial concept.\u201d) (emphasis added). Therefore, the majority\u2019s attempt to distinguish \u201cwitnesses against\u201d from \u201caccusers\u201d is misguided, and its inexplicable contempt for the accusatorial factor of the \u201ctestimonial\u201d inquiry is unsound.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b371-5\"> Evans and Williams were charged with the murders of three police officers in Georgia.

The majority\u2019s approach, on the other hand, asks what the declarant actually believed and whether she had clear or objective reason for that belief.

As things turned out, however, the prosecutor was able to confidently state during his closing argument that \u201cwhat [Debra] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>told Dawn Grove, is what [Mizenko] did.\u201d The jury never had to decide whether Debra\u2019s statements to the contrary were more reliable than her statements to Grove, King, and Buennemeyer; the District Court, in overruling Mizenko\u2019s hearsay objections, did that for them.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-10\">The majority dismisses the force of Debra\u2019s Victim\u2019s Impact Statement and attached letter, pointing out that they were \u201cnot submitted until after trial, and [have] <em>no </em>evidentiary value as to the propriety of admitting Debra\u2019s various statements, nor as to Mizenko\u2019s guilt.\u201d \u00b6 29. (Notably, the majority makes no mention of the one document that <em>was </em>submitted before trial and had tremendous evidentiary value both as to Mizenko\u2019s guilt and as to the propriety of admitting Debra\u2019s various statements, but which was not presented to the jury: Debra\u2019s notarized letter recanting her earlier statements.) The point of quoting from the Victim\u2019s Impact Statement and attached letter, however, is to highlight the fact that Debra had recanted the statements she had made to Grove, King, and Buennemeyer and had provided a new version of events that completely contradicted those earlier statements, something the prosecutor would have been forced to contend with had Mizenko not been denied his right to confront the witnesses against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-11\">The majority also points out that the hearsay statements contained in the Victim\u2019s Impact Statement suffer from lack of oath, inability to cross-examine, and inability to assess credibility, as well as Debra\u2019s \u201cample opportunity\u201d to reflect and fabricate her statements. <em>See </em>\u00b6 29. Of course, the same is true of her hearsay statements to Grove, King, and Buennemeyer, which is exactly why <em>none </em>of Debra\u2019s statements should have been admitted at trial absent confrontation. Moreover, if the majority truly believed that statements made after a declarant has had \u201cample opportunity\u201d to reflect and fabricate should not be admitted, then it would not affirm the admission of Debra\u2019s statements to Grove, King, and Buennemeyer in this case. Ironically, the majority condemns Debra\u2019s \u201cpremeditated, conscientious attempt to provide testimony\u201d of an <em>exculpatory </em>nature via the Victim\u2019s Impact Statement, but not her \u201cpremeditated, conscientious attempt to provide testimony\u201d of an <em>inculpatory </em>nature via Grove, King, and Buennemeyer. <em>See </em>\u00b6 29.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"41\">\n<p id=\"b394-7\"> In the pertinent part quoted, this language is identical to Rule 804(b)(3), M.R.Evid., and Fed.

These cases put pressure on the lower appellate courts to narrow the definition of testimonial, to expand exceptions to preserve convictions, or both. This is true even though, had the more exacting requirements been known earlier, confrontation could often have been provided and the evidence introduced. Also, a host of prosecutorial actions could have been taken either to admit alternative evidence or to avoid creating or admitting evidence that violates the Confrontation Clause.\u201d Mosteller, <em>Encouraging and Ensuring, </em>at 517 (footnote omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"53\">\n<p id=\"b413-9\"> The questions presented in <em>Davis and Hammon, </em>respectively, are \u201c[w]hether an alleged victim\u2019s statements to a 911 operator naming her assailant - admitted as \u2018excited utterances\u2019 under a jurisdiction\u2019s hearsay Taw - constitute \u2018testimonial\u2019 statements subject to the Confrontation Clause restrictions enunciated in <em>Crawford v.
