We dismiss the appeal as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">\u00b62 The following issues are raised on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">\u00b63 Did the District Court have jurisdiction to act on a motion for declaratory and injunctive relief after R.E.A.was placed in community-based services?</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">\u00b64 Did the District Court err in construing \u00a7 53-20-132, MCA, as not prohibiting R.E.A.\u2019s placement by court order in community-based services?</p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">\u00b65 Did the District Court err in holding \u00a7 53-20-132, MCA, unconstitutional?</p>\n<p id=\"b415-11\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b415-12\">\u00b66 R.E.A. is an adult male with a developmental disability. On September 11, 2000, the District Court found R.E.A. to be \u201cseriously developmentally disabled\u201d as defined in \u00a7 53-20-102(15), MCA (1999), and committed him involuntarily to the Montana Developmental Center (MDC) for one year. R.E.A. was recommitted for an additional year, which expired September 11, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-13\">\u00b67 On August 8, 2002, one month before the end of R.E.A.\u2019s commitment, the Cascade County Attorney filed a petition for recommitment. The residential facility screening team (RFST), acting pursuant to \u00a7 53-20-133, MCA, and under DPHHS\u2019s authority, determined R.E.A. was no longer seriously developmentally disabled and on August 20, 2002, referred him for placement in community-based services, though this recommendation was not communicated to the District Court. No further action was taken by any party on the petition for recommitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-14\">\u00b68 For nearly thirteen months after the expiration of his final commitment period, R.E.A. remained at MDC, which continued to provide residential care and habilitation services to him. On August 8, 2003, R.E.A. filed a motion for declaratory and injunctive relief requesting an order placing him in community-based services. Later <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>that month, a community-based services facility in Libby, Montana, accepted R.E.A. for placement. On September 5, 2003, the Cascade County Attorney filed a motion to dismiss R.E.A.\u2019s motion for declaratory relief. On October 6, 2003, the District Court received notice that R.E.A. would be discharged from MDC and placed with the facility in Libby on October 8,2003, and the District Court later found that R.E.A. was placed on that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">\u00b69 At hearing, an employee of the Mental Disabilities Board of Visitors testified that out of nineteen MDC residents who had been found not seriously developmentally disabled over the previous few years, five had chosen to leave MDC immediately, while the others remained at MDC while waiting for community placement. On October 31, 2003, the District Court issued an order granting R.E.A.\u2019s motion for declaratory and injunctive relief, ordering his placement in community-based services. The District Court determined that R.E.A. had been held in a <em>de facto </em>involuntary commitment at MDC for the thirteen months from the expiration of his last commitment period until his placement in Libby. Further, the District Court concluded that \u00a7 53-20-132, MCA, did not prohibit a court from ordering the provision of community-based services and that, alternatively, in the event \u00a7 53-20-132, MCA, did prohibit such an order, the statute was unconstitutional because it violated R.E.A.\u2019s rights to due process, dignity, equal protection, and speedy remedy for every injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">\u00b610 \u201cThe standard of review of a district court\u2019s findings of fact is whether the findings are clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Galassi v. Lincoln County Bd. of Comm\u2019rs, </em>2003 MT 319, \u00b6 7, 318 Mont. 288, \u00b6 7, 80 P.3d 84, \u00b6 7. \u201c[W]e review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law for correctness.\u201d <em>Galassi, </em>\u00b6 7. \u201cWhen resolution of an issue involves a question of constitutional law, our review is plenary.\u201d <em>State v. Price, </em>2002 MT 229, \u00b6 27, 311 Mont. 439, \u00b6 27, 57 P.3d 42, \u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">\u00b611 Did the District Court have jurisdiction to act on a motion for declaratory and injunctive relief after R.E.A. was placed in community-based services?</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">\u00b612 DPHHS argues that the District Court lost its jurisdiction in this case once R.E.A. was placed with a community-based services facility on October 8,2003, thus making its order on October 31,2003, invalid. Specifically, DPHHS contends that \u00a7 53-20-128(8), MCA, required the District Court to dismiss the August 2002 petition for recommitment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>once R.E.A. was placed in community-based services. The relevant portion of \u00a7 53-20-128(8), MCA (emphasis added) states, \u201cIf the resident is placed in community-based services or if the need for developmental disabilities services no longer exists, the court <em>shall </em>dismiss the petition.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">\u00b613 R.E.A. responds that the District Court retained jurisdiction \u201cprimarily because the court [had] inherent jurisdiction over its orders and to compel obedience with them.\u201d In addition, he argues the District Court had jurisdiction because the District Court had the responsibility of safeguarding R.E.A.\u2019s rights at every stage of the proceedings, R.E.A. had standing to seek a declaratory judgment with respect to the constitutionality of \u00a7 53-20-132, MCA, and this matter was not mooted by R.E.A.\u2019s placement with a community-based services facility because the issue was \u201ccapable of repetition, yet evading review.\u201d <em>See In Re Mental Health of K.G.F., </em>2001 MT 140, \u00b6 20, 306 Mont. 1, \u00b6 20, 29 P.3d 485, \u00b6 20.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">\u00b614  This matter presents a troubling procedural history in several respects, such as the RFST\u2019s failure to file its recommendations with the District Court regarding the August 2002 petition, R.E.A.\u2019s use of a motion to seek declaratory relief, and DPHHS\u2019s and Cascade County\u2019s failure to move the District Court to dismiss the pending recommitment petition after R.E.A. had been determined to no longer be seriously developmentally disabled. However, we conclude that we need not address these matters and the parties\u2019 arguments regarding the District Court\u2019s subj ect matter jurisdiction, or lack thereof, because the issues have been mooted. <em>See Shamrock Motors, Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., </em>1999 MT 21, \u00b6 19, 293 Mont. 188, \u00b6 19, 974 P.2d 1150, \u00b6 19 (\u201cA matter is moot when, due to an event or happening, the issue has ceased to exist and no longer presents an actual controversy.\u201d); <em>see also Wilson v. State Highway Comm\u2019n </em>(1962), 140 Mont. 253, 257, 370 P.2d 486, 488. Prior to the District Court\u2019s order, R.E.A. was placed in the community-based services which he sought, and, at the time of oral argument before this Court, was continuing to receive those services. Further, the Court recently issued an opinion with regard to the ultimate issue herein, the constitutionality of \u00a7 53-20-132, MCA, <em>in In the Matter of T.W., </em>2005 MT 340, 330 Mont. 84, 126 P.3d 491. Thus, we need not undertake consideration of the issue as one which has evaded review. Given R.E.A.\u2019s placement and our decision in T.W., this matter is mooted, and the appeal is hereby dismissed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b417-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, LEAPHART, WARNER, NELSON and DISTRICT JUDGE GUSTAFSON, sitting for JUSTICE REGNIER concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
