The state was represented by Bill Fullbright.</p>\n<p id=\"AI6\">Before hearing the application, the defendant was advised that the Sentence Review Division has the authority not only to reduce the sentence or affirm it, but also increase it. The defendant was further advised that there is no appeal from a decision of the Sentence Review Division. The defendant acknowledged that she understood this and stated that she wished to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"AhL\">The Division finds that the reasons advanced for modification are sufficient to hold that the sentence imposed by the District Court is clearly excessive, in light of the defendant\u2019s first felony conviction and sentences for similar crimes around the state.</p>\n<p id=\"AaJI\">Therefore, it is the unanimous decision of the Sentence Review Division that the sentence shall be amended as follows: Counts I-V: A commitment of Ten (10) years to the Department of Corrections on each count, with Nine (9) years suspended on each count, to run consecutively. The restitution requirements, terms and conditions shall remain the same as imposed in the October 15, 2004 Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"Ajz\">Done in open Court this 1st day of April, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"AOA\">DATED this 13th day of April, 2005.</p>\n<judges id=\"A7O\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>Chairperson, Hon.
