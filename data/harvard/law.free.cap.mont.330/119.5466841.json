The defendant acknowledged that he understood this and stated that he wished to proceed.</p>\n<p id=\"A1Y\">Ride 17 of the Rules of the Sentence Review Division of the Supreme Court of Montana provides that \u201cthe sentence imposed by the District Court is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>presumed correct, and the sentence will not be reduced or increased unless it is deemed clearly inadequate or excessive.\u201d (\u00a746-18-904(3), MCA).</p>\n<p id=\"Axo\">The Division finds that the reasons advanced for modification are insufficient to hold that the sentence imposed by the District Court is inadequate or excessive.</p>\n<p id=\"AzqG\">Therefore, it is the unanimous decision of the Sentence Review Division that the sentence shall be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"AHXK\">Done in open Court this 15th day of November, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"AmBv\">DATED this 22nd day of November, 2005.</p>\n<judges id=\"AsJg\">Chairperson, Hon.
