We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-10\">\u00b62 McConkey raises the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b72-11\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court err in holding that Flathead Electric does not have to pay McConkey 100% of his accrued personal time?</p>\n<p id=\"b72-12\">\u00b64 2. Did the District Court err in ruling as a matter of law that there was good cause for McConkey\u2019s discharge?</p>\n<p id=\"b72-13\">\u00b65 3.

Did the District Court err in concluding as a matter of law that Defendant Malone did not libel McConkey?</p>\n<p id=\"b72-14\">\u00b67 5. Did the District Court err in dismissing McConkey\u2019s claim for infliction of severe emotional distress?</p>\n<p id=\"b72-15\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b72-16\">\u00b68 Appellant Warren McConkey was hired as the general manager of Flathead Electric Cooperative (FEC) on March 16, 1988. He held this position until he was terminated on February 13, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-17\">\u00b69 In 1998, FEC acquired PacifiCorp, an investor owned utility that served the urban areas of northwest Montana. FEC paid $110 million for PacifiCorp and increased its customer base from approximately 12,000 to 55,000 subscribers. As FEC\u2019s general manager, McConkey developed the plan to acquire the assets of PacifiCorp. McConkey <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>began to implement his acquisition plan in 1996, although it had been his goal to acquire PacifiCorp since he took over as general manager. McConkey actively campaigned for the acquisition, and it was eventually approved by FEC\u2019s Board of Trustees (Board). FEC did not seek member approval. The acquisition was highly leveraged, which had a negative effect on FEC\u2019s debt/equity ratio, causing it to be ranked lower for borrowing purposes. Also, following the acquisition, it was discovered that PacifiCorp had misstated revenues on its financial statements, which later contributed to FEC\u2019s fiscal problems.</p>\n<p id=\"Ac\">\u00b610 In 1999, FEC began to experience financial deficits; $2.08 million in 1999 and $1.2 million in 2000. This was a result of several factors, including the leveraged acquisition of PacifiCorp and the rising costs of energy. Concerning the latter, McConkey stated in his deposition that he thought cooperatives would fare well in an open market pricing environment. This was evinced in the power supply contracts McConkey negotiated wherein the per megawatt purchase price was fixed for the first three years, followed by a five-year contract binding FEC to pay a variable rate based upon a market price index. McConkey believed that FEC would benefit from such a contract because electric supply rates would remain stable. In addition, McConkey believed FEC would be able to secure lower supply costs through greater bargaining power after its acquisition of PacifiCorp.</p>\n<p id=\"A4\">\u00b611 When FEC\u2019s power supply contract switched to open-market pricing, its cost of electrical power increased from approximately $40,000 a month to a high of $840,000 per month. This resulted in revenue deficits that required FEC to increase its electricity rates to its members by 6.9% in April 2000, 29.0% in April 2001, and 12.5% in October 2001. These increases were contradictory to what members had been promised. Thereafter, at a cost of $48,000 to $49,000, FEC retained counsel to explore the possibility of filing for bankruptcy protection.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">\u00b612 In August 2001, a special board meeting was held to consider a motion to terminate McConkey as general manager. McConkey\u2019s perceived inadequacies and failures were read into the record, in his presence. In addition, a summary of these reasons was prepared by a minority of the members of the Board and presented to McConkey. The motion to terminate McConkey was rejected by a 7 to 5 vote. However, there continued to be controversy over whether McConkey should be retained. McConkey did not accept the criticism from the minority of the Board as something he needed to address in order to keep his job.</p>\n<p id=\"Alk\">\u00b613 In December 2001, a general manager performance review form <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>was completed by each board member. All parties agreed that the results of this review were conflicting; with the reviews falling along lines similar to that of the August 2001 vote.</p>\n<p id=\"AUz\">\u00b614 Thereafter, at a meeting on February 13, 2002, the Board voted unanimously to terminate McConkey as general manager. There had been no change in board members since the August 2001 meeting. A letter was delivered to McConkey stating the reasons for his discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"AFL\">\u00b615 At the time McConkey was terminated he had accrued personal (vacation) time under FEC\u2019s policies. He was. paid cash for 95% of this accrued personal time.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">\u00b616 James Malone was elected to FEC\u2019s Board of Trustees in 2001. Shortly after being elected, Malone made it clear to McConkey that he would work to have him fired as general manager. In April 2001, just after assuming his seat on the Board, Malone began writing letters to local newspapers. These letters are the primary basis for McConkey\u2019s defamation claim against Malone. In addition to the letters, there were several advertisements placed in local newspapers regarding McConkey and FEC management, which Malone may have had some part in.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">\u00b617 Following his termination, McConkey filed a complaint seeking damages from FEC for wrongful discharge alleging that he was not terminated for good cause and that FEC violated its written personnel polices. McConkey further sought damages from FEC for failure to pay personal time, that had accrued prior to his termination, at 100% of his salary. McConkey also filed claims against Malone for libel, and infliction of emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-7\">\u00b618 The District Court granted FEC\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissed McConkey\u2019s claims against FEC, finding that he was terminated for good cause, FEC did not violate its written personnel policies, and that personal time accumulated by McConkey was not wages pursuant to \u00a7 39-3-201(6)(a), MCA. The District Court also granted Malone\u2019s motion for summary judgment and dismissed McConkey\u2019s libel and emotional distress claims. McConkey appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-8\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b74-9\">\u00b619 We review a district court\u2019s summary judgment ruling <em>de novo </em>and employ the same method of evaluation, based upon Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P., as applied by the district court. <em>Andrews v. Plum Creek Mfg., LP., </em>2001 MT 94, \u00b6 5, 305 Mont. 194, \u00b6 5, 27 P.3d 426, \u00b6 5. Summary judgment is proper if the record discloses no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>matter of law. <em>Lutey Const, v. State </em>(1993), 257 Mont. 387, 389, 851 P.2d 1037, 1038. A party seeking summary judgment has the burden of establishing a complete absence of any genuine factual issues. <em>Howard v. Conlin Furniture No. 2, Inc. </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 433, 436, 901 P.2d 116, 118. Once the moving party has met its burden, the opposing party must present material and substantial evidence, rather than mere conclusory or speculative statements, to raise a genuine issue of material fact. <em>Hanson v. Water Ski Mania Estates, </em>2005 MT 47, \u00b6 11, 326 Mont. 154, \u00b6 11, 108 P.3d 481, \u00b6 11. All reasonable inferences that might be drawn from the offered evidence should be drawn in favor of the party opposing summary judgment. <em>Howard, </em>272 Mont. at 437, 901 P.2d at 119.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-5\">DISCUSSION ISSUE 1</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">\u00b620 Did the District Court err in holding that Flathead Electric does not have to pay McConkey 100% of his personal time?</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">\u00b621 FEC provides its employees with \u201cpersonal time,\u201d analogous to vacation time, where the objective is \u201c[t]o make available personal time to be used by an employee for vacation, personal illness, personal accident or other personal business.\u201d McConkey argues that the District Court erred in holding that his personal time did not qualify as \u201cwages\u201d pursuant to \u00a7 39-3-201(6)(a), MCA, and holding that he was thus not entitled to be paid for all such time he accrued at 100%.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-8\">\u00b622 Section 39-3-204(1), MCA, requires that an employer pay its employees \u201cthe wages earned by the employee ....\u201d (emphasis added). The statute further defines \u201cwages,\u201d in part, as \u201cany money due an employee from the employer ....\u201d Section 39-3-201(6)(a), MCA. Under a plain reading of the statute, the District Court was correct in concluding that the personal time, as a matter of law, does not automatically qualify as \u201cwages.\u201d However, to the extent the employer has obligated itself to pay money for earned but unused personal time, there exists an obligation to pay wages under \u00a7 39-3-201(6)(a), MCA. Thus, FEC is liable to McConkey for the amount it agreed to pay. <em>Langager v. Crazy Creek Products, Inc., </em>1998 MT 44, \u00b6 25, 287 Mont. 445, \u00b6 25, 954 P.2d 1169, \u00b6 25 (the employer is obligated to pay that which is earned, due and owing). Here, the parties agree that McConkey earned the relevant personal time. The issue is whether the policy set by FEC, that McConkey would be compensated for earned personal time at 95% of his pay rate, is legal.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-9\">\u00b623  The employer is free to set the terms and conditions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>employment and compensation. <em>Langager, </em>\u00b6 25 (quoting <em>Rowell v. Jones &amp; Vining Inc. </em>(Maine 1987), 524 A.2d 1208, 1211). The employee is free to accept or reject those conditions. <em>Langager, </em>\u00b6 25. Setting a 95% cash value as the conversion of accrued personal time to wages is a reasonable condition of employment. <em>Cf. Langager, </em>\u00b6 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-4\">\u00b624  In <em>Langager </em>we held that the employee was entitled to reimbursement for her earned vacation time. <em>Langager, </em>\u00b6 32. The condition we refused to enforce in <em>Langager </em>required the employee to work a scheduled shift immediately after her paid vacation period, and failure to do so resulted in the loss of that vacation pay. <em>Langager, </em>\u00b6 31. We held that such a condition subsequent was unenforceable as the employee had already earned the vacation pay. <em>Langager, </em>\u00b6 31. In this case, the 95% reimbursement rate is not a condition subsequent preventing McConkey from earning personal time and later exchanging it for cash. The 95% policy sets the cash value of the benefit when it is earned. Employers are free to negotiate with employees what benefits will be extended and the value of such benefits. <em>Langager, </em>\u00b6 25. Thus, because FEC had obligated itself, under its agreement with McConkey, to pay cash for only 95% of the personal time he had accrued, the other 5% did not constitute wages that were part of McConkey\u2019s agreed compensation. We affirm the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the payment of 95% of McConkey\u2019s personal time was proper.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b76-5\">ISSUE 2</p>\n<p id=\"b76-6\">\u00b625 Did the District Court err in ruling as a matter of law that there was good cause for McConkey\u2019s discharge?</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">\u00b626 A discharge is wrongful if it is not for good cause. Section 39-2-904(l)(b), MCA. Good cause includes a legitimate business reason, which we have defined as \u201ca reason that is neither false, whimsical, arbitrary or capricious, and it must have some logical relationship to the needs of the business.\u201d <em>Buck v. Billings Montana Chevrolet, Inc., </em>(1991), 248 Mont. 276, 281-282, 811 P.2d 537, 540. In applying this definition we stress the importance of the \u201cright of an employer to exercise discretion over who it will employ and keep in employment.\u201d <em>Buck, </em>248 Mont. at 282, 811 P.2d at 540. It is inappropriate for courts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>to become involved in the day-to-day employment decisions of a business. <em>Buck, </em>248 Mont. at 282, 811 P.2d at 541. Further, the discretion we afford employers is at its greatest in cases like this one, where the employee occupies a \u201csensitive\u201d managerial position exercising \u201cbroad discretion,\u201d specifically, where the employment relationship is between a company\u2019s board of trustees and its general manager. <em>See Buck, </em>248 Mont. at 283, 811 P.2d at 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\">\u00b627 The District Court ruled that as a matter of law FEC had good cause to terminate McConkey. In support of its ruling, the District Court stated four reasons evincing good cause:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b77-5\">[(1) Subsequent to the acquisition of PacifiCorpt, FEC\u2019s] debt/equity ratio dropped to the low single digitst; (2)] the Bigfork Hydro power supply went from a cost of approximately $40,000 a month to a high of $840,000[; (3)] in May of 2001,t] FEC retained bankruptcy counsel at the cost of approximately $48,000 to $49,000[;] and [(4) FEC], based upon increased costs of service, raised electricity rates to consumers [] by 6.9% in April of 2000, 29% in April 2001, and 12.5% in October 2001.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">The District Court concluded McConkey failed to raise any genuine issues of material fact that would tend to show the reasons for termination were false, whimsical, arbitrary or capricious, or that such reasons had no logical relationship to the needs of FEC.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">\u00b628 On appeal, McConkey argues that there are material issues of fact that the District Court overlooked. McConkey argues that only one of the four factors listed by the District Court, the rate increases, corresponds to the termination letter that was sent by FEC to McConkey stating the reasons he was fired. As a matter of public policy, McConkey argues, courts should not consider reasons not given to the employee upon termination; otherwise employers would be encouraged to give unreasonably vague justifications for termination and later defend their actions with matters that were not specifically identified.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">\u00b629 We have stated that generally, in wrongful discharge cases, reasons for discharge other than those set forth in a discharge letter are irrelevant, and thus inadmissible. <em>Galbreath v. Golden Sunlight Mines, Inc. </em>(1995), 270 Mont. 19, 23, 890 P.2d 382, 385. We later distinguished <em>Galbreath, </em>in <em>Jarvenpaa v. Glacier Electric Cooperative, Inc., </em>1998 MT 306, 292 Mont. 118, 970 P.2d 84, holding that unlike collateral issues, such as those offered in <em>Galbreath, </em>evidence offered to \u201csubstantiate the reasons [] already given in [the termination] letter\u201d are admissible. <em>Jarvenpaa, </em>\u00b6 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>\u00b630 In its discharge letter to McConkey, FEC stated, \u201cDecisions made based on your recommendations on wholesale power supply contracts have caused substantial rate increases to members. These recommendations negatively impacted the Cooperative financially for the years 2000 to 2001.\u201d The District Court did not err in stating FEC\u2019s debt/equity ratio, its substantial electric power cost increases from contracts negotiated by McConkey, and the necessity to retain bankruptcy counsel, as reasons for McConkey\u2019s termination. All of these substantiate the negative financial impact, referenced in the termination letter, that FEC suffered as a result of McConkey\u2019s activities relating to the acquisition of PacifiCorp.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">\u00b631  McConkey attempts to distinguish this case from the facts in <em>Buck, </em>where the employer/defendant had a long history of placing his own employees in management positions within the companies he acquired. McConkey is correct that there was no such history or practice in employing general managers by FEC. However, it is the rationale in Buck that a general manager has less protection than an employee who makes no policy decisions, that is applicable here. <em>Buck, </em>248 Mont. at 283, 811 P.2d at 541. Under the present circumstances, where the cause for termination was based upon the faults or errors of the general manager, which in the opinion of the Board caused substantial damage to the company, a board of trustees has broad discretion in determining whether the general manager failed to satisfactorily perform his job. Such a failure constitutes a legitimate business reason to terminate employment. To conclude otherwise would involve the courts in the day-to-day employment decisions of a business. <em>See Buck, </em>248 Mont. at 282, 811 P.2d at 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">\u00b632 McConkey points out that, at the time of the August 2001 special board meeting, the board members were fully aware of the four reasons later listed by the District Court as constituting good cause to fire him, yet a majority of the members voted to retain him as general manager at that time. McConkey argues that later using the same reasons to justify the unanimous vote to terminate him in February 2002 makes these reasons false, whimsical, arbitrary, and capricious, because the reasons given no longer had a logical relationship to the needs of FEC. What McConkey really argues is that the Board cannot change its mind without further justification. However, McConkey cites no authority for this proposition. Rather, in an attempt to support his argument, McConkey points to the record that indicates several board members stated that McConkey \u201cdid not do anything\u201d between the August 2001 meeting and the February 2002 meeting. He argues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>that such statements show that there were no new reasons to justify a termination vote at the later meeting. However, these statements do not support his argument, it is just as logical to assume that the statements mean the Board fired him because he failed to do anything to fix the problems.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-4\">\u00b633  In a case such as this, where the complaining employee is in an executive position, makes top level policy and strategic decisions, and great trust is placed in his judgment, courts must be cautious in second guessing employment decisions of the company\u2019s board. <em>See Buck, </em>248 Mont. at 282-283,811 P.2d at 541. We decline to do so in this Instance where McConkey has failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact that the reasons given for his termination are in fact outside the realm of legitimate business interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">ISSUE 3</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">\u00b634 Did the District Court err in ruling that Flathead Electric did not violate its written personnel policies in discharging McConkey?</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">\u00b635  FEC had a written policy that related directly to McConkey, stating: \u201cIn a case where the General Manager is the subject of disciplinary action, the Board will adopt an appropriate disciplinary procedure.\u201d McConkey contends that this policy required \u201cprogressive\u201d discipline because it contained the word \u201cprocedure.\u201d Therefore, he argues, the policy was violated because his termination did not follow a progressive disciplinary procedure. To further support this, McConkey cites to one board member\u2019s deposition wherein it was stated that the Board had a progressive disciplinary procedure in place. We conclude, as did the District Court, that because there were no express, specific requirements regarding what constituted an appropriate disciplinary procedure contained in FEC\u2019s policy, there was therefore no requirement that the discipline be progressive.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">\u00b636 Section 39-2-904(l)(c), MCA, states that a discharge is wrongful if \u201cthe employer violated the express provisions of its own written personnel policy.\u201d Contrary to McConkey\u2019s argument, the use of the word \u201cprocedure\u201d in the FEC policy did not constitute an express requirement that any disciplinary measure taken against the general manager be progressive. We decline to read extraneous statements into FEC\u2019s written policy. Regardless of what one board member said about Board procedures, the fact remains that the policy did not expressly state that termination of the general manager required a progressive disciplinary procedure.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>\u00b637 Alternatively, McConkey argues that the Board failed to adopt an \u201cappropriate disciplinary procedure,\u201d as is expressly required under the FEC policy. Again, McConkey cites to the deposition of a single board member to support this. The board member was asked, \u201cAre you aware of any disciplinary procedure that was adopted by the Board specific to Warren?\u201d The board member replied, \u201cNo.\u201d Notwithstanding this response, we conclude that a disciplinary procedure was adopted by the Board when it held several meetings to consider McConkey\u2019s performance and continued employment, put him on paid administrative leave while these discussions progressed, voted to terminate him and then provided him with written notice and justification for the termination. The Board is given discretion in forming an appropriate disciplinary procedure within the express language of its policy. McConkey has raised no genuine issue of material fact concerning whether this express, written policy was violated by FEC.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-4\">\u00b638 The second FEC policy McConkey argues was violated stated in part, \u201cDisciplinary actions outlined in this policy may be taken by [FEC] management if an employee ... demonstrates an inability to meet [FEC] standards of job performance or conduct.\u201d McConkey contends that there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether he in fact demonstrated an inability to meet the applicable standards of job performance or conduct. Assuming this policy applied to McConkey, we refer to our discussion above concerning McConkey\u2019s managerial failures articulated by the Board. It follows that in the opinion of the Board, which we decline to second guess, McConkey \u201cdemonstrated an inability to meet [FEC] standards of job performance or conduct.\u201d As, under the circumstances of this case, it was the Board\u2019s prerogative to make the decision concerning whether job standards were met, there is no genuine issue of material fact concerning whether the express, written policy was violated.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">ISSUE 4</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">\u00b639 Did the District Court err in concluding as a matter of law that Defendant Malone did not libel McConkey?</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">\u00b640 McConkey claims that Malone defamed him via several writings published primarily in newspapers in the Flathead region. Particularly, McConkey notes a letter written by Malone stating in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b80-8\">This mess is the result of a board of trustees allowing management to exert too much influence into decisions that are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>entrusted to the board by members of the co-op through the election of trustees. Management has led the co-op through direct actions and through bad recommendations to the board over the last five years into one h[ell] of a mess.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">McConkey also alleges that Malone placed ads in a local paper discussing a proposed amendment to FEC bylaws, stating the amendment was:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-5\">[Bjrought to you by the same Co-op manager and same faction of board of trustees who:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-6\">Are responsible for the mismanagement that resulted in your more than 50 percent electric bill increase.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-7\">Approved a salary for the co-op manager of over $140,000 with benefits bringing the compensation package to more than $250,000 annually, an amount double the average of the co-op managers in Montana.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-8\">Are responsible for your paying the highest electrical rates in the state and the increase in your basic rate from $6 to $21.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-9\">Are responsible for increasing the annual interest paid by the co-op from $1.3 million to $9.1 million.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-10\">Are responsible for paying $30 million too much for PacifiCorp.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A8-\">The ad continued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-11\">The manager wants to change the voting to a mail-in ballot because he believes that a majority of the members do not know that the reason their electric bill increased was largely due to co-op mismanagement. We have the highest Co-op Electrical rates in the state due to mismanagement! This manager knows that informed members who take the time to attend meetings are very likely to vote against his poor management practices.... Why would this manager and his faction of rubber-stamped trustees spend over $40,000 to hold a special election two months prior to the regularly scheduled meeting?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b81-12\">\u00b641 McConkey alleges that these writings were defamatory and false, and seeks damages from Malone for publishing them. The District Court held that the statements were not defamatory and granted summary judgment to Malone.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-13\">\u00b642 Pursuant to \u00a7 27-1-802, MCA, defamatory libel is:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b81-14\">[A] false and unprivileged publication by writing, printing, picture, effigy, or other fixed representation to the eye which exposes any person to hatred, contempt, ridicule or obloquy or which causes him to be shunned or avoided or which has a tendency to injure him in his occupation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>\u00b643 McConkey argues that because issues of fact exist as to whether Malone\u2019s statements were false and defamatory, the District Court erred in determining the statements were not defamatory libel as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">\u00b644 We conclude that Malone\u2019s statements did not carry a defamatory meaning and therefore it is unnecessary to determine whether they were false. <em>In Hale v. City of Billings, </em>we stated that \u201csubject to control of the court whenever the issue [of defamation] arises, the jury determines whether ... the matter was true or false.\u201d <em>Hale v. City of Billings, </em>1999 MT 213, \u00b6 17, 295 Mont. 495, \u00b6 17, 986 P.2d 413, \u00b6 17 (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 617). However, we also stated, \u201c[i]n contrast ... the court, as a preliminary finding, must determine \u2018whether a communication is capable of bearing a particular meaning; and ... whether the meaning is defamatory.\u2019\u201d <em>Hale, </em>\u00b6 17 (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 614). Thus, the threshold test is whether the statements, even if false, are capable of bearing a defamatory meaning. If the alleged statements are not defamatory, it is unnecessary for a jury to decide if they are false.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">\u00b645 The test for defamation is stringent. <em>Frigon v. Morrison-Maierle, Inc. </em>(1988), 233 Mont. 113, 121, 760 P.2d 57, 62, <em>overruled on separate grounds by Sacco v. High Country Independent Press, Inc. </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 209, 235, 896 P.2d 411, 426. In <em>Wainman v. Bowler </em>(1978), 176 Mont. 91, 576 P.2d 268, we stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b82-6\">Defamation words to be actionable ... must be of such nature that the court can presume as a matter of law that they will tend to disgrace and degrade [the plaintiff] or cause him to be shunned and avoided. It is not sufficient, standing alone, that the language is unpleasant and annoys or irks him, and subjects him to jests or banter, so as to affect his feelings.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b82-7\"><em>Wainman, </em>176 Mont. at 96, 576 P.2d at 271. In <em>Frigon, </em>we applied this definition to an employment situation and concluded that as a matter of law an employer\u2019s comments directed at areas of the employee\u2019s job performance needing improvement were not statements that disgraced or degraded the employee. <em>Frigon, </em>233 Mont. at 121, 760 P.2d at 62. Here, the published statements allegedly made by Malone were merely critical of the performance of FEC, its Board of Trustees, and its management. However, as determined by the District Court, there is no evidence that they disgraced or degraded McConkey, or caused him to be shunned or avoided.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">\u00b646 McConkey argues that the statements injured him in his occupation because he was terminated. However, McConkey has failed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>to produce evidence that FEC\u2019s Board was influenced by alleged defamatory statements.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The record contains no statement by a board member that he or she voted to terminate McConkey because of the alleged defamatory material. Even McConkey testified at his deposition to the effect that a number of the board members told him that the content of the statements did not influence their votes.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">\u00b647  Further, the District Court correctly concluded that claims of defamatory libel may not be based on innuendo or inference, and that allegedly libelous statements must be aimed specifically at the person claiming injury. <em>Wainman, </em>176 Mont. at 94, 576 P.2d 270 (\u201cIf the language is not slanderous per se it cannot be made so by innuendo[.]\u201d) <em>(quoting Keller v. Safeway Stores, Inc. </em>(1940), 111 Mont. 28, 31-32,108 P.2d 605, 608). Thus, statements made by Malone regarding FEC as an entity do not constitute libel against McConkey.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">\u00b648 Nor do sarcastic and hyperbolic statements meet the stringent test for defamation. <em>Burr v. Winnett Times Pub. Co. </em>(1927), 80 Mont. 70, 77, 258 P. 242, 244 (concluding statements were only sarcasm and thus not libelous). Statements such as \u201cManagement has led the co-op ... into one h[ell] of a mess[,]\u201d are hyperbolic and not actionable. <em>See Burr, </em>80 Mont. at 77, 258 P. at 244.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">\u00b649 Finally, a basic principal in the law of defamation is that an expression of opinion generally does not carry a defamatory meaning and is thus not actionable. <em>Frigon, </em>233 Mont. at 121, 760 P.2d at 62. Here, under the circumstances of this particular case, even if Malone\u2019s statements directly accuse McConkey of mismanagement, they are merely statements of opinion. <em>Frigon, </em>233 Mont. at 121,760 P.2d at 62 (citing <em>Janklow v. Newsweek </em>(8th Cir., 1985), 759 F.2d 644). For example, the statement that FEC \u201cpa[id] $30 million too much for PacifiCorpt,]\u201d was simply Malone\u2019s opinion, not a misstatement of fact, and therefore cannot constitute defamation.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">\u00b650 McConkey argues, however, that under <em>Hale, </em>even if Malone\u2019s statements regarding mismanagement were opinion, the statements were still defamatory. We held in <em>Hale, </em>if the stated opinion does not disclose the facts upon which it is based, and as a result creates the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>reasonable inference that it is based on defamatory facts, there is no protection for the statement. <em>Hale, </em>\u00b6 27. However, McConkey has failed to suggest what inferred facts are undisclosed in this case. To the contrary, the publicly disclosed facts concerning FEC\u2019s financial problems and rate increases are obvious and disclosed. It is not defamatory to express the opinion that FEC\u2019s publicly known financial problems were the result of mismanagement, and that the general manager may have been partially responsible.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Therefore, in this case there was no reasonable inference that Malone\u2019s opinions were based on undisclosed defamatory facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">\u00b651  We conclude that the District Court was correct in its holding that, as a matter of law, McConkey failed to produce any publications bearing a defamatory meaning. Having so held, it is not necessary to proceed further and consider whether McConkey was a limited public figure for purposes of public debate regarding the operation of FEC.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">ISSUE 5</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">\u00b652 Did the District Court err in dismissing McConkey\u2019s claim for infliction of severe emotional distress?</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">\u00b653 McConkey, as an independent claim for relief against Malone, alleged negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The District Court dismissed this claim, concluding that McConkey\u2019s affidavit, which stated that he sought counseling to help him deal with his emotional distress due to the \u201chumiliation\u201d from the \u201cpublic smear campaign,\u201d was insufficient to show severe emotional distress. McConkey argues Malone failed to present any evidence that he did not suffer severe emotional distress.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">\u00b654 It is McConkey\u2019s burden to come forth with material and substantial evidence to support his claim. <em>Hanson, </em>\u00b6 11. Only if he presents evidence sufficient to meet the standard to establish severe emotional distress does the burden shift to Malone to produce contrary evidence. <em>See Hanson, </em>\u00b6 11.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">\u00b655 The district court must determine whether the plaintiff has produced sufficient evidence to support a prima facie case for infliction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>of emotional distress. <em>Sacco v. High Country Independent Press, Inc. </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 209, 236, 896 P.2d 411, 427. If the evidence produced by McConkey, viewed in a light most favorable to him, is insufficient as a matter of law, his claim must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">\u00b656  In this case, even if McConkey sought counseling to deal with his \u201closs of self-esteem and self-worth,\u201d arguably the result of the public criticism, the District Court did not err in holding that this fact alone is insufficient to establish a claim for emotional distress \u201cso severe that no reasonable [person] could be expected to endure it.\u201d <em>Sacco, </em>271 Mont. at 234, 896 P.2d at 426. As discussed throughout this Opinion, McConkey held an executive, managerial position with FEC, a utility company which serves thousands of customers in the area. One holding such a position must be willing to accept some public criticism regarding his or her job performance when rates rise dramatically. Considering the facts as alleged by McConkey, we conclude the mental stress he claims he suffered in this case, caused by the public discourse surrounding his termination, does not rise to that level which a reasonable man, normally constituted, in McConkey\u2019s position, would be unable to adequately cope with. <em>See Sacco, </em>271 Mont. at 231, 896 P.2d at 424.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b85-6\">\u00b657 We affirm the District Court.</p>\n<judges id=\"b85-7\">JUSTICES MORRIS, COTTER and RICE concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b76-8\"> McConkey also argues that FEC had created a precedent of paying 100% of personal time to other terminated employees. However, he has not cited any authority supporting the notion that an employer\u2019s decision to pay more than it owes to one employee somehow binds the employer to do the same in all instances.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b83-8\"> This is true of all the alleged defamatory statements that could be misstatements of fact. For example, even if the statement regarding McConkey\u2019s salary is false, he fails to show how such a misstatement would tend to degrade or disgrace him; arguing only that he was terminated as a result of the statement is insufficient to show defamation. Further, a misstatement of a general manager\u2019s salary is unlikely to influence a board of trustee\u2019s decision to terminate him, as surely the board would know the general manager\u2019s true salary and use this correct amount in its determination.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b84-10\"> The facts from Hale are clearly distinguishable from this case. In <em>Hale, </em>Billing\u2019s Police made a public statement claiming that, \u201cIn our <em>opinion, </em>we think Mark Hale [plaintiff! is a most wanted fugitive, who may be armed and dangerous.\u201d <em>Hale, </em>\u00b6 28. There were no publicly disclosed facts to support the statement; therefore it was reasonable to conclude that the public would have inferred that there were undisclosed facts, known to the police, to support the opinion that Hale was, for example, \u201carmed and dangerous.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b85-8\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY,</author>\n<p id=\"ANy\">specially concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">\u00b658 For the most part, I join in the Court\u2019s analysis of the issues presented and in the result the Court reaches in this case. I also join in those portions of the Court\u2019s opinion on issue 3 which conclude that nothing in FEC\u2019s written personnel policies required progressive discipline before McConkey could be discharged, and that McConkey has failed to establish a genuine issue of material fact regarding whether he demonstrated an inability to meet the standards of job performance or conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-10\">\u00b659 I write separately to state the basis on which I join the Court\u2019s result with regard to McConkey\u2019s argument that the Board failed to adopt an appropriate disciplinary procedure for McConkey, as required by FEC\u2019s written policies. The Court concludes, in essence, that the Board\u2019s acts of terminating McConkey and then providing him with written notice and justification for the termination constituted compliance with the written policy requiring the Board to \u201cadopt an appropriate disciplinary procedure\u201d in a case involving discipline of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>general manager. I do not agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">\u00b660 It is my view that the written policy required the Board to actually adopt an appropriate disciplinary procedure, in the same <em>manner </em>as it had <em>adopted </em>a progressive disciplinary procedure applicable to its other employees. The procedure clearly was intended to be separate and apart ffom-and need not be the same as-the procedure for other employees. The Board did not adopt such a procedure, and I would conclude it violated its written policy in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">\u00b661 Under the circumstances of this case, however, I also would conclude that the violation did not provide a basis for a wrongful discharge claim by McConkey, because he did not raise a genuine issue of material fact that whatever procedure the written policy necessitated would have been required to include more elements than the actions the Board took-which included several meetings between representatives of the Board and McConkey to attempt to resolve what was perceived as paralysis within the FEC, several discussions of the matter at executive sessions of the Board, a vote to terminate at an open Board meeting, notice to McConkey and written justification for the termination.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">\u00b662 I realize that all of this may seem a distinction without a difference. At the bottom line, it is. I write, however, out of an abundance of caution and concern for future cases. This case presents facts very different from the ordinary wrongful discharge case, and it is crucial to safeguard the vitality of \u00a7 39-2-904(l)(c), MCA, which states that a discharge is wrongful if \u201cthe employer violated the express provisions of its own written personnel policy.\u201d It is important that the Court\u2019s statements to the effect that the acts of terminating McConkey were the functional equivalent of actually adopting a procedure will not be relied on by employers-or used against terminated employees-in future cases.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
