We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-7\">\u00b62 Henderson raises two issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b57-8\">\u00b63 1. Did the District Court abuse its discretion in allowing a firefighter to testify as a lay witness regarding certain aspects of his investigation?</p>\n<p id=\"b57-10\">\u00b64 2. Were Henderson\u2019s due process rights violated at sentencing?</p>\n<p id=\"b57-11\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b57-12\">\u00b65 The State of Montana charged Henderson with four felonies, alleging he unlawfully broke into an apartment, set fire to it, endangered building occupants and concealed cigarette lighters after arrest. Henderson pled not guilty, and the case proceeded to trial. Eleven witnesses, including firefighter Bobby Wiench, testified for the State, and three witnesses testified for the defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-13\">\u00b66 During Wiench\u2019s testimony, defense counsel objected numerous times on grounds that Wiench was not qualified as an expert and, therefore, certain testimony lacked foundation. The District Court overruled the first such objection after the prosecutor explained the type of testimony anticipated in response to his question. After the second objection, the court allowed defense counsel to <em>voir dire </em>the witness and ultimately overruled the objection, determining Wiench could testify as a lay witness based on his experience as a firefighter. The court also overruled subsequent objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-14\">\u00b67 Ultimately, the jury convicted Henderson of all four felony offenses. At sentencing, the State offered sixty (60) years without parole. Previously, however, the State had offered fifty (50) years with twenty-five (25) years suspended. Henderson rejected this offer. The District Court sentenced Henderson to twenty (20) years for felony arson, twenty (20) years for felony burglary, and five (5) years for felony evidence tampering. These sentences were to run concurrently. The court also sentenced him to fifty (50) years for felony criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>endangerment to run consecutively with the other three felony counts. The sentences were to be served at Montana State Prison (MSP). Henderson appeals. We set forth additional facts as necessary in the discussion below.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">\u00b68 We review rulings on the admissibility of evidence, including oral testimony, for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Cesnik, </em>2005 MT 257, \u00b6 12, 329 Mont. 63, \u00b6 12, 122 P.3d 456, \u00b6 12 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b58-7\">\u00b69 <em>Did the District Court abuse its discretion in allowing a firefighter to testify as a lay witness regarding certain aspects of his investigation?</em></p>\n<p id=\"A6R\">\u00b610 Rules 701 and 702, M.R.Evid., address lay and expert testimony. Rule 701, M.R.Evid., provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-8\">[i]f the witness is not testifying as an expert, the witness\u2019 testimony in the form of opinions or inferences is limited to those opinions or inferences which are (a) rationally based on the perception of the witness and (b) helpful to a clear understanding of the witness\u2019 testimony or the determination of a fact in issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AN\">Rule 702, M.R.Evid., provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-9\">[i]f scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-10\">Pursuant to \u00a7 46-16-201, MCA, Rules 701 and 702, M.R.Evid., apply in criminal cases as well as in civil cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-11\">\u00b611 Henderson asserts the District Court abused its discretion in admitting Wiench\u2019s testimony regarding points of origin, pour patterns, the fire pattern, the lack of evidence of mechanical and electrical causes, the risk to building occupants and the possibility the fire could have blocked exits. He contends the admission of this testimony prejudiced him with respect to the arson, burglary and criminal endangerment convictions because the testimony was \u201cthe foundation of the State\u2019s case\u201d and was offered to establish the fire \u201cwas intentional and not an accident.\u201d Henderson does not challenge his conviction of the offense of tampering with physical evidence; therefore, we do not address it.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-12\">\u00b612 Defense counsel did not request a continuing objection at trial, nor does Henderson assert on appeal that we should construe his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>objections as continuing objections. We do not address an argument or issue when the appellant has failed to contemporaneously object or otherwise raise the issue at trial. <em>State v. Todd, </em>2005 MT 108, \u00b6 19, 327 Mont. 65, \u00b6 19, 111 P.3d 677, \u00b6 19 (citation omitted). Here, the unchallenged testimony includes Wiench\u2019s definition of the term \u201cpoint of origin\u201d as \u201cwhere the fire started,\u201d his discussion of ruling out mechanical and electrical causes, and the following exchange regarding pour patterns:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-4\">Q: What exactly is the concept of a pour pattern?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-5\">A: It\u2019s a pattern you look for where whatever substance has been poured will bum and will burn hotter than the rest of the area. So you\u2019ll have an area that\u2019s burned deeper than the other area. It hasn\u2019t spread to the area-a piece of carpet, for example. Where the pour is, it\u2019ll burn, but it won\u2019t bum much past it if it\u2019s caught fast enough to where the-the rest of the carpet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-6\">Q: So that leaves a specific kind of burn damage, based upon the fires you\u2019ve worked?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-7\">A: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b59-8\">As stated, Henderson did not object to these portions of Wiench\u2019s testimony and they remain unchallenged.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-9\">\u00b613  In addition, we note that Henderson\u2019s counsel sought and received permission to <em>voir dire </em>Wiench in the presence of the jury during the State\u2019s case. During <em>voir dire, </em>Wiench responded to defense counsel\u2019s questions by--among other things-discussing how to find a point of origin of a fire, describing indications of arson, and discussing pour patterns. While we appreciate that counsel was attempting to challenge Wiench\u2019s qualifications as an expert, the fact is that the State offered the testimony as lay testimony, and the court admitted it as such. If Henderson\u2019s counsel believed that the testimony adduced during the <em>voir dire </em>was inadmissible as lay testimony, he should have asked the court to strike the testimony or moved for a limiting instruction. Rule 103, M.R.Evid. (Error may not be predicated upon a ruling which admits evidence unless a substantial right of the party is affected <em>and </em>a timely objection or motion to strike appears of record.); see also <em>State v. Long, </em>2005 MT 130, \u00b6 25, 327 Mont. 238, \u00b6 25, 113 P.3d 290, \u00b6 25 (When a trial judge withdraws or strikes improper testimony from the record with an accompanying cautionary instruction to the jury, any error committed by its introduction is presumed cured.). In the case before us, Henderson\u2019s counsel did neither. Nor did he register a continuing objection to much of the ensuing testimony which was premised in part upon Wiench\u2019s <em>voir dire </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>testimony. A party waives the right to contest evidence on appeal when that party\u2019s actions elicited the evidence. <em>State v. Smith, </em>2005 MT 18, \u00b6 10, 325 Mont. 374, \u00b6 10, 106 P.3d 553, \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"AJ\">\u00b614 As stated above, the District Court overruled Henderson\u2019s objection when the prosecutor described the anticipated response to his question. On appeal, Henderson does not mention this ruling or Wiench\u2019s response, which was that a battalion chief first told him about the possibility of arson. Thus, we decline to address Wiench\u2019s testimony following the first objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">\u00b615 Henderson next objected when the prosecutor asked Wiench if he believed one item in the living room was a point of origin. After defense counsel conducted <em>voir dire, </em>the trial court overruled the objection, reasoning Wiench \u201cis and has been demonstrated here today to be an experienced, knowledgeable firefighter and is testifying within the scope of his observations and function.\u201d While the record supports the District Court\u2019s statement about Wiench\u2019s training and experience, Wiench was not presented or qualified as an expert witness and, in fact, the State expressly stated it was not offering Wiench\u2019s testimony as expert testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">\u00b616 The question remains, however, whether Wiench\u2019s testimony following the ruling, as set forth below, was expert testimony or lay testimony:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-7\">Q: Mr. Wiench, as you worked through this scene, did there appear to be areas where the most concentrated burning had taken place? Based on what you personally saw?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-8\">A: Yes, sir. There\u2019s three.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-9\">Q: And where were they located?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-10\">A: On the couch, in the living room, at the foot of the bed in the bedroom, and there was a spot in between the bed and the closet where it was burnt completely through the carpet, which was not a protected-none of the rest of the area around it was protected. And it had burned all the way through. And there was also the area between the bed and the dresser.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-11\">Q: And you personally saw that bed when you did your walk-through. Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-12\">A: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-13\">Q: And you personally saw the burn damage near the closet. Is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-14\">A: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-15\">Q: Did you also see the burn damage that was actually on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>couch?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-4\">A: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">As stated above, Rule 701, M.R.Evid., provides, in part, that a lay witness may state opinions and inferences that are rationally based on his or her perceptions. In this exchange, Wiench testified based on his personal observations and inferences drawn therefrom that three areas of the apartment appeared more burned than others. Such testimony constitutes lay testimony pursuant to Rule 701, M.R.Evid. Thus, we conclude the District Court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the lay testimony that followed Henderson\u2019s second expert testimony-related objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">\u00b617 Henderson objected again following the prosecutor\u2019s request that Wiench identify where in the residence he had seen anything that looked like a pour pattern to him. The District Court ruled Wiench could apply his \u201cunobjected to testimony as to what a pour pattern is,\u201d as set forth in \u00b6 12 above, to \u201chis observations at the scene.\u201d The following exchange then occurred between the prosecutor and Wiench, beginning with a discussion of an unspecified photograph exhibit that is apparently State\u2019s Exhibit 14:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-7\">Q: Could you please show me a photo that in your mind would be consistent with a pour pattern?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-8\">A: This pattern over right here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-9\">Q: Okay. And what aspect of this photo would appear to be a pom-pattern to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-10\">A: You can see the-undemeath the couch where it has bmned deeper. But nothing on this side happened. It was dripped down. You can see where it had dripped down-whatever was pomed on it was dripped down underneath and started that underneath on fire.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-11\">Q: Were there other rooms in the house where you thought you might have seen a pour pattern?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-12\">A: The bedroom. There\u2019s a better pictme of a pour pattern.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-13\">Q: Okay. And this is State\u2019s Exhibit Number 8. Is that essentially a close up of the other item you showed us on the couch?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-14\">A: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-15\">Q: Okay. Thank you. Let me show you another pictme here. This is State\u2019s Exhibit Number 11. Can you tell me what\u2019s depicted in this exhibit?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-16\">A: You can see where the-where the bedding is burnt away on two sides of the bed. But up in the-it would be the southeast comer of the bed, the way the bed is facing-how everything is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>still-you can still see the blankets. So you know that the fire got hotter on this outside edge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-4\">Q: When you explored this room during your walk-through, did it appear that that bed was more extensively burned than other items in the room?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-5\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-6\">Q: Just based on looking at them with your own eyes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-7\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-8\">Q: Oh, I\u2019m sorry. What did you say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-9\">A: The floor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-10\">Q: Did that appear to be a pour pattern as well?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-11\">A: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-12\">Q: And which room was that located in?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-13\">A: That was in the bedroom.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-14\">Q: Okay. Can you please tell me where that was again? In relation to the closet?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-15\">A: It was right in front of the closet between the foot of the bed and the closet.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-16\">Q: And you\u2019re saying you saw more extensive burning here than you did in the areas immediately next to it? Is that what you\u2019re saying?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-17\">A: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-18\">Q: And again, this is State\u2019s Exhibit Number 9?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b62-19\">A: Yes.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-20\">\u00b618  Again, Wiench properly testified as a lay witness that he personally observed areas on or near the couch and bed that appeared more extensively burned than other areas. However, Wiench\u2019s testimony also went beyond personal observations made at the scene, to his identifications of pour patterns in diagrams and photographs. \u00b619 While we might well conclude in another case that identification of pour patterns by a firefighter crosses over into the realm of expert testimony, we do not so conclude under the circumstances presented here. As indicated above, Wiench had already testified without objection about pour patterns. \u00b6 12. He then moved on to describe the areas of the apartment that appeared to him to be extensively burned. We have concluded that these statements were based upon personal observations. \u00b6 18. The diagrams and photographs do no more than illustrate for the jury the areas of the apartment he observed, and to which he had already testified. Accordingly, and given Henderson\u2019s failure to object to the testimony concerning pour patterns, we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>conclude the court did not err in allowing Wiench to identify in the photographs and diagrams the pour patterns he had observed at the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-4\">\u00b620 Finally, Henderson objected, on the basis of speculation, to testimony by Wiench that other tenants could have been endangered by this fire. The District Court overruled his objection and allowed Wiench to answer. Henderson makes passing reference to this ruling in one sentence in his Brief but presents no argument to support his contention that the District Comb\u2019s ruling was erroneous, or that he was prejudiced thereby. Rule 23(a)(4), M.R.App.P., requires that an appellant present a concise, cohesive argument which \u201ccontain[s] the contentions of the appellant with respect to the issues presented, and the reasons therefor, with citations to the authorities, statutes and pages of the record relied on.\u201d We have repeatedly held that we will not consider unsupported issues or arguments. <em>In re Marriage of McMahon, </em>2002 MT 198, \u00b6 6, 311 Mont. 175, \u00b6 6, 53 P.3d 1266, \u00b6 6. Therefore, we decline to consider this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">\u00b621 For the foregoing reasons, we conclude the District Court did not abuse its discretion in ruling upon the firefighter\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">\u00b622 <em>Were Henderson\u2019s due process rights violated at sentencing?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">\u00b623 Henderson presents no argument that the District Court\u2019s sentence was illegal. He argues exclusively that the State vindictively recommended a higher sentence at the sentencing hearing than it had offered previously. However, the record contains no documentation of the State\u2019s earlier offer. We cannot render a decision based exclusively on Henderson\u2019s unsupported allegations. Absent evidence corroborating his allegations or supporting his argument, we cannot address the merits of his claim. Rule 9(a), M.R.App.P., requires that a party seeking review of a judgment, order, or proceeding must present a record sufficient to enable us to rule on the issues raised. Henderson has failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b63-9\">\u00b624 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<judges id=\"b63-10\">JUSTICES RICE, NELSON and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b63-11\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY,</author>\n<p id=\"AXf\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-12\">\u00b625 I concur in portions of the Court\u2019s opinion, but not in other portions or in the result the Court reaches. I respectfully dissent from the Court\u2019s determination that Wiench\u2019s identifications of pour patterns in photographs and on the scene constituted lay testimony. Because it is my view that the District Court abused its discretion in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>admitting that testimony and the State has not satisfied its burden of establishing harmless error, I would reverse and remand for a new trial. Consequently, I would not address Henderson\u2019s final expert testimony-related objection, nor would I reach Issue 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">\u00b626 Contrary to the Court\u2019s characterization in \u00b6 19, Wiench did not merely \u201cdescribe the areas of the apartment that appeared to him to be extensively burned\u201d after Henderson\u2019s expert testimony-related objection. If the only testimony at issue were Wiench\u2019s affirmative responses to the prosecution\u2019s questions about \u201cmore extensively burned areas,\u201d it would be appropriate to characterize that testimony as lay testimony based on personal observations-as the majority properly does with respect to Wiench\u2019s testimony after the earlier expert testimony-related objection in \u00b6 16. However, as the Court acknowledges in \u00b6 18, \u2018Wiench\u2019s testimony also went beyond personal observations made at the scene, to his identifications of pour patterns in diagrams and photographs.\u201d Indeed, Wiench identified a pour pattern in what is presumably State\u2019s Exhibit 14 and opined that something \u201cwas dripped down underneath\u201d the couch. He also reaffirmed his identification of that pour pattern with respect to the close-up picture, presented as State\u2019s Exhibit 8, and identified a separate pour pattern on the floor, as presented in State\u2019s Exhibit 9. In my view, Wiench\u2019s identifications and specific descriptions of pour patterns differ from his testimony that some areas of the apartment appeared more burned than others and constitute expert opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">\u00b627 In determining whether the District Court abused its discretion in admitting Wiench\u2019s identifications of pour patterns as Rule 701, M.R.Evid., lay testimony based on its determination that Wiench was an \u201cexperienced, knowledgeable firefighter,\u201d it is appropriate to address the authorities advanced by the parties and our related jurisprudence. In my opinion, our cases on the issue of whether \u201cofficial\u201d personnel may testify as lay witnesses based on their training and experience are in disarray and require clarification for the purpose of guiding trial judges and attorneys in future civil and criminal cases on this increasingly confused subject. This need is highlighted by the Court\u2019s statement that in another case, \u201cwe might well conclude... that identification of pour patterns by a firefighter crosses over into the realm of expert testimony[.]\u201d <em>See </em>\u00b6 19. Therefore, I address the cases in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">\u00b628 In <em>Massman v. City of Helena </em>(1989), 237 Mont. 234, 242, 773 P.2d 1206, 1211, we concluded a firefighter\u2019s testimony based on \u201cspecialized, technical knowledge\u201d was beyond the scope of Rule 701, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>M.R.Evid., lay testimony. Four years later, in <em>Hislop v. Cady </em>(1993), 261 Mont. 243, 249, 862 P.2d 388, 392, we concluded a police officer could testify about the cause of an accident based on his training and experience, but we did not specify whether that testimony was Rule 701, M.R.Evid., lay testimony or Rule 702, M.R.Evid., expert testimony. In <em>Onstad v. Payless Shoesource, </em>2000 MT 230, \u00b6\u00b6 40-42, 301 Mont. 259, \u00b6\u00b6 40-42, 9 P.3d 38, \u00b6\u00b6 40-42, we relied exclusively on <em>Hislop </em>in determining law enforcement officers could testify as lay witnesses based on their training and experience.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\">\u00b629 In <em>State v. Nobach, </em>2002 MT 91, \u00b6\u00b6 8-22, 309 Mont. 342, \u00b6\u00b6 8-22, 46 P.3d 618, \u00b6\u00b6 8-22, we determined a highway patrol officer\u2019s testimony regarding the effect of prescription medications on a criminal defendant\u2019s driving ability was expert opinion testimony requiring foundation, rather than lay testimony. In doing so, we observed that in <em>Hart-Anderson v. Hauck </em>(1989), 239 Mont. 444, 781 P.2d 1116, a civil case, we had not addressed Rule 701 or Rule 702, M.R.Evid., but our emphasis there on an officer\u2019s training and experience \u201csuggested] that we had in mind the foundational requirement of Rule 702\" when we determined an officer had adequate foundation to testify about the cause of an accident. <em>Nobach, </em>\u00b6 18. We also reasoned that <em>State v. </em>Gregoroff(1997), 287 Mont. 1,951 P.2d 578, \u201c\u2018fills in the blanks\u2019 we left in <em>Hart-Anderson by </em>clarifying that a law enforcement officer can offer an expert opinion about the cause of an accident so long as sufficient foundation is presented, as required by Rule 702, M.R.Evid.\u201d <em>Nobach, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 19-20.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">\u00b630 Similarly, in <em>Christofferson v. City of Great Falls, </em>2003 MT 189, \u00b6\u00b6 35-49, 316 Mont. 469, \u00b6\u00b6 35-49, 74 P.3d 1021, \u00b6\u00b6 35-49, we determined a trial court properly excluded paramedics\u2019 lay opinions regarding the likelihood of a successful intubation because those opinions were \u201cwithin the realm of expert testimony requiring foundation.\u201d In tracing our prior cases, we stated that, \u201c[w]hile we did not expressly state in either <em>Hislop </em>or <em>Hart-Anderson </em>that the officers\u2019 testimony was properly admitted as expert testimony under Rule 702, as opposed to lay testimony under Rule 701, the language of those cases certainly supports that inference.\u201d <em>Christofferson, </em>\u00b6 47. We distinguished <em>Onstad </em>on the basis that the officers in that case \u201cwere not offering scientific opinions,\u201d while \u201cthe paramedics [in Christofferson] were being called upon to do just that.\u201d <em>Christofferson, </em>\u00b6 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">\u00b631 Approximately a year later, in <em>State v. Frasure, </em>2004 MT 305, \u00b6\u00b6 17-18,323 Mont. 479, \u00b6\u00b6 17-18, 100 P.3d 1013, \u00b6\u00b6 17-18, we concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>police officers\u2019 training and experience \u201cprovided a sufficient foundation for them to provide lay opinion testimony as to whether it was likely that [the criminal defendant] possessed the drugs with intent to sell.\u201d We relied exclusively on <em>Onstad </em>and <em>Hislop </em>in doing so. \u00b632 As this recitation demonstrates, two lines of cases have developed with respect to whether \u201cofficial\u201d personnel may testify as lay witnesses about scientific, technical or other specialized knowledge, based on their training and experience. One line of cases, consisting of <em>Frasure </em>and <em>Onstad, </em>holds that training and experience may form a basis for an \u201cofficial\u201d person\u2019s Rule 701, M.R.Evid., lay testimony. The other line, consisting primarily of <em>Christoff erson, Nobach </em>and <em>Massman, </em>holds that testimony based on training and experience conveying scientific, technical or specialized knowledge offered to assist the trier of fact is Rule 702, M.R.Evid., expert testimony. I believe we are obligated to rectify this situation as we have done with some frequency in recent years when parallel lines of authority have come to our attention. <em>See, e.g., Quantum Electric, Inc. v. Schaeffer, </em>2003 MT 29, \u00b6\u00b6 16-30, 314 Mont. 193, \u00b6\u00b6 16-30, 64 P.3d 1026, \u00b6\u00b6 16-30; <em>In re Estate of Bradshaw, </em>2001 MT 92, \u00b6\u00b6 14-16, 305 Mont. 178, \u00b6\u00b6 14-16, 24 P.3d 211, \u00b6\u00b6 14-16.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">\u00b633 The plain language of Rule 702, M.R.Evid., and our recognition in <em>Christofferson </em>that <em>Hislop </em>was almost certainly an expert testimony case lead me to conclude that testimony based on a \u201cfoundation\u201d of training and experience is expert testimony under Rule 702, M.R.Evid., when that testimony involves \u201cscientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge [that] will assist the trier of fact.\u201d I would overrule <em>Frasure, Onstad </em>and any other cases to the extent they state \u201ctraining and experience\u201d may form a basis for lay testimony. As a result, I would also conclude the District Court in the present case was incorrect in reasoning that training and experience may form a basis for lay testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b66-5\">\u00b634 Turning to Wiench\u2019s identifications of pour patterns over Henderson\u2019s expert testimony-related objection, I first observe Rule 701, M.R.Evid., limits lay testimony to opinions or inferences rationally based on the witness\u2019 perception. In <em>Nobach, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 15-17, we reasoned an officer could not offer lay opinion testimony about the effects of prescription drugs on a person\u2019s driving ability because, while most adults can recognize indications of alcohol intoxication, we were \u201cnot persuaded that lay people are sufficiently knowledgeable about common symptoms of drug consumption, much less the effects of drug consumption on a person\u2019s ability to drive a motor vehicle safely, to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>offer lay opinion testimony on those subjects, based on personal observations, under Rule 701.\u201d Similarly, here I am not persuaded that a lay person is sufficiently familiar with the concept of a pour pattern to identify one on the scene or in a photograph.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-4\">\u00b635 Moreover, I do not agree with the Court that Wiench\u2019s \u201cunobjected to\u201d general description of a pour pattern, as set forth in \u00b6 12, is dispositive in this regard. The question is not whether the jury, after hearing the description, could infer the presence of pour patterns based on photographs and testimony regarding personal perceptions. The question is whether Wiench\u2019s actual identification of pour patterns is an expert opinion, as opposed to lay testimony based on personal observations and reasonable inferences therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">\u00b636 In this respect, I wholeheartedly agree with the Court\u2019s observation in \u00b6 19 that the photograph exhibits \u201cdo no more than illustrate for the jury the areas of the apartment [Wiench] observed[.]\u201d Indeed, I do not believe an unassisted lay person could identify the pour patterns Wiench identified in the photographs-even in light of his unchallenged general description of a pour pattern. The fact that the pour patterns are not obvious in the pictures further buttresses my view that Wiench\u2019s testimony is not based solely on his personal observations and reasonable inferences therefrom, as contemplated by Rule 701, M.R.Evid.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">\u00b637 Rule 702, M.R.Evid., defines expert testimony, in part, as \u201cscientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge\u201d that will \u201cassist the trier of fact to understand the evidence\u201d and requires that only a witness qualified by \u201cknowledge, skill, experience, training, or education may testify thereto[.]\u201d In my view, Wiench\u2019s identifications of pour patterns at the scene and in the photographs went well beyond lay testimony, and constituted scientific, technical or other specialized knowledge offered to assist the jury in understanding that the photograph exhibits depicted pour patterns. Furthermore, based on Wiench\u2019s affirmative answer when asked if a pom- pattern \u201cleaves a specific kind of burn damage, based upon the fires you\u2019ve worked,\u201d I believe Wiench\u2019s experience as a firefighter-not merely his personal observations-enabled him to recognize and identify pour patterns and qualified him to testify about them. Thus, I would conclude Wiench\u2019s identifications of pour patterns fall squarely within the definition of Rule 702, M.R.Evid., expert testimony, and could only be admitted as such. Because the State expressly stated it was not offering Wiench\u2019s testimony as expert testimony, I would hold the District Court abused its discretion in admitting the testimony as lay testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>\u00b638 Finally, it is critical to address the State\u2019s contention that any error in this case-which I conclude occurred-was harmless because no prejudice resulted. The State correctly points to the harmless error analysis we first set forth in <em>State v. Van Kirk, </em>2001 MT 184, 306 Mont. 215, 32 P.3d 735.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-4\">\u00b639 In <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 34-43, we abandoned the \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d test once applied in determining whether errors were harmless. We did so because that test was a \u201c\u2018scorecard\u2019 analysis\u201d that focused on the quantity rather than the quality of the evidence, created \u201can unpredictable and subjective framework,\u201d and could have the \u201cunintended consequence of inviting the State to offer inadmissible yet damaging evidence in a strong case, even if by happenstance, since the worst that can happen is that the error is noted but deemed harmless.\u201d <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 34-35.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-5\">\u00b640 In place of the \u201coverwhelming evidence\u201d test, we adopted-as the State correctly posits-a two-step analysis for determining whether error is harmless or reversible. The first step is to determine whether the error is structural or trial error. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 37. Structural error \u201cis typically of constitutional dimensions, precedes the trial, ... undermines the fairness of the entire proceeding\u201d and requires automatic reversal. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 38-39. Trial error \u201ctypically occurs during the presentation of a case to the jury\u201d and \u201cis amenable to qualitative assessment... for prejudicial impact relative to the other evidence introduced at trial.\u201d <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6 40. If the error is trial error, the analysis proceeds to the second step, which is to determine whether the State has demonstrated the error was not prejudicial under the circumstances. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 41-42. Under this step, the State first \u201cmust direct us to admissible evidence that proved the same facts as the tainted evidence\u201d if it is possible to do so. <em>See Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 44-45. If the State directs us to cumulative evidence regarding an element of the offense or the tainted evidence does not go toward an element, the State then must demonstrate, qualitatively and by comparison to the admissible evidence, that there is no reasonable possibility that the tainted evidence might have contributed to the conviction. <em>Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 44, 47.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-6\">\u00b641 The State asserts the admission of Wiench\u2019s testimony occurred during the presentation of evidence and, therefore, is trial error. It then recites its burdens under <em>Van Kirk, </em>and asserts the photographs and other witnesses\u2019 testimony constitute cumulative, admissible evidence regarding the mental state element of arson. It does not, however, discuss whether Henderson was prejudiced with regard to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>any aspect of the burglary or criminal endangerment charges, nor does it address the \u201cqualitative\u201d aspect of <em>Van Kirk </em>in relation to any charge, including the arson charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-4\">\u00b642 I agree with the State that the admission of Wiench\u2019s identification of pour patterns constitutes trial error and, therefore, I would proceed to the next step of the analysis and determine whether the State has demonstrated the error was not prejudicial. <em>See Van Kirk, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 41-42. Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the State has met its burden of directing us to cumulative, admissible evidence establishing Henderson acted purposely or knowingly, I would conclude the State has utterly failed-indeed, has not even attempted-to meet its burden of demonstrating, qualitatively and by comparison to the admissible evidence, that there was no reasonable possibility that Wiench\u2019s tainted testimony might have contributed to Henderson\u2019s arson conviction. I would further conclude, under the circumstances of this case and absent contrary argument from the State, that the abuse of discretion in admitting Wiench\u2019s testimony was also prejudicial with respect to the burglary and criminal endangerment charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b69-5\">\u00b643 I dissent from the Court\u2019s conclusion that the testimony at issue was lay testimony. I also dissent from the Court\u2019s total failure to address our jurisprudence on this important issue. I would reverse and remand this case for a new trial on the arson, burglary and criminal endangerment charges.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
