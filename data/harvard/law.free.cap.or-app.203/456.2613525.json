J.</author>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">Defendant was convicted of felony driving under the influence of intoxicants, ORS 813.010(5). The trial court imposed an upward durational departure sentence, based on defendant\u2019s failure to appear at an earlier sentencing hearing and a finding that defendant was on probation at the time of the offense. The trial court found that either of the factors was sufficient to support departure. On appeal, defendant challenges only the sentence, arguing that, under <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 US 296, 124 S Ct 2531, 159 L Ed 2d 403 (2004), and <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 US 466, 120 S Ct 2348, 147 L Ed 2d 435 (2000), the court erred in imposing a departure sentence based on facts that defendant did not admit and that were not found by a jury. He concedes that he did not advance such a challenge to the trial court, but argues that the sentence should be reviewed as plain error. The state argues that because defendant admitted that he had failed to appear at an earlier hearing and that he was on probation at the time of the offense, the trial court did not err in imposing the departure sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">In <em>State v. Allen, </em>198 Or App 392, 395-96, 108 P3d 651, <em>adh\u2019d to as clarified on recons, </em>202 Or App 565, 123 P3d 331 (2005), we explained that the imposition of an upward departure sentence based on a defendant\u2019s supervisory status requires inferences, beyond the bare fact that the defendant was on supervision, about the \u201cmalevolent quality\u2019 of the defendant and the failure of supervision to serve as an effective deterrent. Even if defendant acknowledged that he was on probation, he \u201cwas entitled to have a jury determine whether those inferences were appropriate to draw by a standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Id.; see also State v. Perez, </em>196 Or App 364, 102 P3d 705 (2004), <em>rev allowed, </em>338 Or 488 (2005). Consistently with <em>Allen, </em>defendant\u2019s admission that he was on probation was insufficient to support a departure sentence. However, our reasoning in <em>Allen </em>applies with equal force to the imposition of an upward departure sentence based on defendant\u2019s failure to appear at a sentencing hearing. For the purposes of imposing a departure sentence, a defendant\u2019s failure to appear at a sentencing hearing necessarily requires inferences beyond the mere fact <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"459\">*459</page-number>that the defendant missed the hearing \u2014 inferences about, for example, the defendant\u2019s character. Thus, defendant was entitled to have a jury determine whether such inferences were appropriate. The trial court\u2019s imposition of a departure sentence based on judicial findings that defendant was on probation at the time of the crime and that he had failed to appear at an earlier sentencing hearing is therefore plain error that, for the reason discussed in <em>Perez, </em>196 Or App at 373, we exercise our discretion to reach.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-4\">Sentence vacated; remanded for resentencing; otherwise affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
