Arrington, deceased (Charles), sued Peoples Security Life Insurance Company (Peoples Security), alleging breach of contract and seeking recovery of the proceeds under two insurance policies issued on Charles\u2019 life. Peoples Security filed pleas of the statute of limitations, and, after conducting an evidentiary hearing, the trial court sustained the pleas and entered judgments in favor of Peoples Security. Angela appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-13\">The facts relating to the pleas are undisputed. On March 13, 1988, Charles was shot and stabbed to death. At the time of his death, he was insured by a policy of life insurance in the amount of $50,000 (Policy No. U00095393) and by another policy in the amount of $25,000 (Policy No. 0302649180). Both polices had been issued by Peoples Security. The named beneficiary under both policies was Delores R. Arrington (Delores), Charles\u2019 wife. Each policy provided that payment of the policy proceeds to the named beneficiary would be made upon Peoples Security\u2019s receipt of proof of the insured\u2019s death.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>On March 21, 1988, Delores completed a \u201cClaimant\u2019s Statement For Death Claims\u201d and forwarded it and a copy of Charles\u2019 death certificate to Peoples Security. By letter dated March 30, 1988, Peoples Security wrote to Delores and acknowledged that it had received the claims. However, Peoples Security subsequently refused to pay the insurance proceeds to Delores because she was a suspect in Charles\u2019 murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">On December 28, 1989, Delores filed an action in the Circuit Court of the City of Richmond to recover the proceeds under the $50,000 policy, and, on November 1, 1990, she filed another action in said circuit court to recover the proceeds under the $25,000 policy. Delores was awarded a judgment in the amount of $50,000 in the first action; however, we reversed that judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings. <em>Peoples Security Life Ins. </em>v. <em>Arrington, </em>243 Va. 89, 412 S.E.2d 705 (1992).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thereafter, Delores requested and, by orders entered February 4, 1992, was granted a nonsuit in each action.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">On November 19, 1993, Angela qualified as administrator d.b.n. of Charles\u2019 estate.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> By letter dated January 12, 1994, Angela demanded that the insurance proceeds be paid to the estate. Peoples Security refused payment, and Angela filed the present actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">In sustaining the pleas of the statute of limitations, the trial court adopted Peoples Security\u2019s contention and ruled that the limitation period was five years from the time the causes of action accrued, Code \u00a7 8.01-246(2), that the causes of action for breach of contract accrued on the date of the breach, and that the accrual date was March 13, 1988, the date of Charles\u2019 death. At trial, Angela agreed that the applicable limitation period was five years and that the causes of action accrued when the breach of contract occurred. Angela, however, did not agree that the causes of action accrued on the date of Charles\u2019 death. She advanced <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>several arguments below, as she does on appeal, regarding when the causes of action accrued.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\">Angela contends that, with respect to Charles\u2019 estate, the contract was not breached until Peoples Security refused the estate\u2019s demand for payment, made by the estate\u2019s letter dated January 12, 1994. Alternatively, Angela contends that it was not reasonable for the estate to demand payment until \u201cit became clear that there was no other beneficiary under the policy, <em>i.e., </em>on March 13, 1993, after Peoples Security had refused payment to Delores . . . and the statute of limitations precluded her from pursuing her claim any further.\u201d In other words, according to Angela, the statute of limitations did not begin to run against the estate until the limitation period had expired as to Delores. Finally, Angela contends that the statute of limitations was tolled from the time of the entry of the trial court\u2019s judgment in favor of Delores until this Court\u2019s reversal of that judgment, a period of 14 months.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">Statutes of limitations are strictly enforced and exceptions thereto are narrowly construed. Consequently, a statute should be applied unless the General Assembly clearly creates an exception, and any doubt must be resolved in favor of the enforcement of the statute. <em>Westminster Investing Corp. </em>v. <em>Lamps Unlimited, </em>237 Va. 543, 547, 379 S.E.2d 316, 318 (1989); <em>Burns </em>v. <em>Stafford County, </em>227 Va. 354, 359, 315 S.E.2d 856, 859 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">Code \u00a7 8.01-246(2) provides that an action for breach of a written contract must be filed within five years after the cause of action accrues. Code \u00a7 8.01-230 provides that a cause of action for breach of contract accrues and the limitation period commences to run from the date of the alleged breach. With respect to life insurance policies, we have said that, when a policy requires a demand for payment and proof of death, the statute of limitations begins to run on the date of the demand and proof. <em>Page </em>v. <em>Shenandoah Life Ins. Co., </em>185 Va. 919, 925-27, 40 S.E.2d 922, 925-26 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">Applying the foregoing principles of law to the present case, we must reject Angela\u2019s contentions. We do not agree that the causes of action accrued at one time for Delores and at a different time for the estate; nor do we agree that the running of the statute <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>may be tolled, or an exception applied, in the absence of a clear statutory enactment to such effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\">In the present case, the life insurance policies provide when a cause of action accrues. The express language of the policies requires Peoples Security to pay the proceeds when Peoples Security \u201creceive[s] proof of [the] Insured\u2019s death.\u201d The record establishes that Peoples Security acknowledged, in its letter to Delores dated March 30, 1988, that it had received proof of Charles\u2019 death. Therefore, at that time, at the very latest, the five-year statute of limitations began to run. Consequently, Angela\u2019s actions filed on February 15, 1994, are time barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">Accordingly, we will affirm the trial court\u2019s judgments.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b72-7\"> In that action, the trial court had ruled that Delores was not precluded from recovering the insurance proceeds because she was <em>not </em>covered by the definition of \u201cslayer\u201d contained in Code \u00a7 55-401(1). In reversing the judgment, we ruled that Code \u00a7 55-401(1) did not preclude Peoples Security from attempting to prove that Delores \u201cprocured, participated in or otherwise directed\u201d Charles\u2019 death, in violation of the common law. <em>Arrington, </em>243 Va. at 92, 412 S.E.2d at 707.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b72-8\"> The record shows that Delores previously had qualified as administrator of Charles\u2019 estate. However, she resigned as administrator, and Angela succeeded to the office.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b73-8\"> In oral argument before this Court, Angela contended that Peoples Security never has refused to make payment, and, therefore, the statute of limitations has not begun to run. This argument was not advanced at trial. Consequently, we will not consider it on appeal. Rule 5:25.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
