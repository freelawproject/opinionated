Buck (Buck, Hogshire &amp; Tereskerz, </em>on brief), for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b585-5\">No brief or argument for appellee.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b585-6\">SENIOR JUSTICE WHITING</author>\n<p id=\"A912\">delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">This appeal involves the validity, construction, and application of bylaw provisions of a nonstock corporation that is subject to the Property Owners\u2019 Association Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-8\">Lake Monticello, a large residential community in Fluvanna County, is an essentially self-controlled community with its own private utilities, roads, security force, and common amenities, including a lake, golf course, swimming pool, and tennis courts. Access to the community is controlled by private security officers at the main gate and by magnetic cards at other gates.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-9\">Control of these facilities is vested in Lake Monticello Owners\u2019 Association (LMOA), a nonstock corporation that is subject to the provisions of the Property Owners\u2019 Association Act, Code \u00a7\u00a7 55-508 to -516.2. By its very terms, this Act has restricted and limited application.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-10\">The Act does not apply</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-11\">to the (i) provisions of documents of, (ii) operations of any association governing, or (iii) relationship of a member to any association governing condominiums created pursuant to the Condominium Act ([Code] \u00a7 55-79.39 et seq.), cooperatives created pursuant to the Virginia Real Estate Cooperative Act ([Code] \u00a7 55-424 et seq.), time-shares created pursuant to the Virginia Real Estate Time-Share Act ([Code] \u00a7 55-360 et seq.), or membership campgrounds created pursuant to the Virginia Membership Camping Act ([Code] \u00a7 59.1-311 et seq.).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b586-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>Code \u00a7 55-508(B). Additionally, this Act does not apply \u201cto any nonstock, nonprofit, taxable corporation with nonmandatory membership which, as its primary function, makes available golf, ski, and other recreational facilities both to its members and the general public.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">LMOA\u2019s corporate purpose is set out in the various documents that create and regulate LMOA and the community it controls. The declaration provides that LMOA \u201cshall operate and maintain the club, lake, roads, parks, and other recreational facilities.\u201d The declaration also subjects each lot owner, as a member of LMOA, to LMOA\u2019s \u201cArticles [of Incorporation] and By-laws, including the payment of such charges and levys as may properly be made by the Association.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">The articles of incorporation charge LMOA with responsibility for the \u201ccommon welfare and safety of the residents of Lake Monticello.\u201d The bylaws charge LMOA to \u201cprovide for the necessary operation, administration, and government of Lake Monticello . . . and ... to provide machinery for the interpretation, application, administration and enforcement of certain restrictions and covenants affecting all lots.\u201d LMOA\u2019s published \u201cpolicy manual\u201d contains its rules, regulations, and policies and states that \u201cLMOA Rules and Regulations are defined in LMOA Documents (Covenants and Restrictions, Articles of Incorporation, By-Laws, Policies, Rules and Regulations). \u201cPursuant to LMOA\u2019s articles of incorporation and bylaws, each lot owner is a member of LMOA with voting rights in the election and removal of directors and in the amendment, alteration, or repeal of its bylaws.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">Additionally, the Property Owners\u2019 Association Act vests in a majority of LMOA members, as members of a property owners\u2019 association, the right to \u201crepeal or amend any rule or regulation adopted by the board of directors\u201d if such rule or regulation has been adopted by the board \u201cwith respect to use of the common areas [or] such other areas of responsibility assigned to the association by the declaration.\u201d Code \u00a7 SS-S^A).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> There is no similar statutory right given to shareholders, under the Virginia Stock <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>Corporation Act, Code \u00a7\u00a7 13.1-601 to -800, or to members, under the Virginia Nonstock Corporation Act, Code \u00a7\u00a7 13.1-801 to -980. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 13.1-624, -662, -823, and -846.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-4\">Jared L. Lake and some other members in LMOA were dissatisfied with a number of the bylaws, rules, regulations, and policies adopted by LMOA\u2019s board of directors and contained in LMOA\u2019s policy manual. Section 4.08 of the bylaws gives LMOA members the right to make proposals \u201cappropriate for member action\u201d for inclusion in the proxy statement and notice for an annual meeting. Acting pursuant to this bylaw provision, Lake and those other property owners filed a number of proposals to amend certain of LMOA\u2019s bylaws, rules, regulations, and policies at the next annual meeting of LMOA members.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">A summary of the proposed amendments pertinent to this appeal follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-6\">1. Repeal of a requirement that a lot owner\u2019s invitee obtain a guest card or pass before entering the subdivision, even though they possess one of the lot owner\u2019s magnetic cards.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-7\">2. Imposition of a limitation on the board\u2019s discretion in fixing annual green fees by exempting property owners who do not play golf from payment of such fees, and by specifying the minimum green fees to be fixed by the board.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-8\">3. Repeal of a provision for LMOA\u2019s compliance committee\u2019s assessment of \u201cpenalties, including the assessing of charges and similar sanctions,\u201d by transferring that function to the courts.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-9\">4. Repeal of a provision authorizing the appointment of members of LMOA\u2019s security force as special policemen under the provisions of Code \u00a7 15.1-144.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b587-10\">5. Amendment of provisions restricting access by prospective purchasers of properties in Lake Monticello by providing for a two-hour pass to be issued by the guards at the main gate.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b587-11\">Bylaw \u00a7 4.08(c)(1) and (6), respectively, provide that a member proposal \u201cmay be disqualified\u201d from inclusion in LMOA\u2019s proxy statement and notice of meeting if \u201cit is not a proper subject for action by members\u201d or if \u201cit deals with a matter relating to the ordinary business operations of the Association.\u201d Relying <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>on these bylaw provisions and on other bylaw provisions which LMOA has since waived, the board ruled that the proposals \u201cd[id] not qualify for inclusion on the LMOA proxy/ballot\u201d and refused to include them in the proxy.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">Lake filed this action as a motion for declaratory judgment seeking a construction of the provisions of Code \u00a7 55-513 and \u00a7 4.08 of the bylaws and a declaration that the proposals were proper for inclusion in LMOA\u2019s proxy statement.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Following an <em>ore tenus </em>hearing, the trial court invalidated the provisions of \u00a7 4.08(c)(1) and (6) because they were \u201coverly broad, arbitrary and in violation of [Code] \u00a7 55-513.\u201d Thereafter, the court ruled that the association members were entitled to have these proposed amendments included in the proxy statement for appropriate action at the next LMOA members\u2019 meeting. We granted LMOA an appeal.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">LMOA contends that the trial court erred in invalidating \u00a7 4.08(c)(1) and (6) of the bylaws. Specifically, LMOA argues that those provisions are not inconsistent with Code \u00a7 55-513. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">A settled rule of statutory construction is that \u201c[i]f apparently conflicting statutes can be harmonized and effect given to both of them, they will be so construed.\u201d <em>Albemarle County v. Marshall, </em>215 Va. 756, 761, 214 S.E.2d 146, 150 (1975); <em>Blue </em>v. <em>Virginia State Bar, </em>222 Va. 357, 359, 282 S.E.2d 6, 8 (1981). We think that this rule is equally applicable when there could be a conflict between a statute and corporate bylaws, and the bylaws may be construed to avoid that conflict. Thus, in the context of this case, we construe the imprecise bylaw phrases \u201cproper subject for action by members\u201d and \u201crelating to the ordinary business operations of the Association\u201d to limit the board\u2019s disqualification right to those proposals which relate to matters within the exclusive control of the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-7\">Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court erred in holding that Code \u00a7 55-513 invalidated \u00a7 4.08(c)(1) and (6) of LMOA\u2019s bylaws. Since we find that these subsections are valid, we must now decide whether the proposals were properly disqualified by the board.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"571\">*571</page-number>LMOA contends that we need not inquire into the correctness of LMOA\u2019s decision since Lake failed to introduce any evidence showing that LMOA\u2019s board of directors acted in bad faith in making its decision. This, according to LMOA, is a prerequisite for judicial review of LMOA\u2019s construction of its rule because a corporate board\u2019s decision is subject to a presumption of correctness under the \u201cbusiness judgment rule.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b589-4\">Under this rule, a corporate director ordinarily has no individual liability for business decisions made \u201cin accordance with his good faith judgment of the best interests of the corporation.\u201d Code \u00a7 13.1-870(A); <em>see Izadpanah </em>v. <em>The Boeing Joint Venture, </em>243 Va. 81, 83, 412 S.E.2d 708, 709 (1992) (transfer of corporate assets); <em>Giannotti </em>v. <em>Hamway, </em>239 Va. 14, 24, 387 S.E.2d 725, 731 (1990) (payment of compensation to corporate officers and directors). And in an action to review the directors\u2019 business decision, the decision itself is also entitled to the same presumption. <em>Gottlieb </em>v. <em>Economy Stores, </em>199 Va. 848, 857, 102 S.E.2d 345, 352 (1958) (expulsion of member of nonstock grocers\u2019 cooperative marketing corporation for misleading advertising reflecting upon integrity of corporation); <em>Penn </em>v. <em>Pemberton &amp; Penn, </em>189 Va. 649, 661, 53 S.E.2d 823, 829 (1949) (continuance of corporate existence).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-5\">As the name implies, a necessary predicate for the application of the business judgment rule is that the directors\u2019 decision be that of a <em>business </em>judgment and not a decision, such as that in this case, which construes and applies a statute and a corporate bylaw. In the latter instance, a trial court reviews the decision just as it would review a similar decision by any other party. <em>See Gottlieb, </em>199 Va. at 857-58, 102 S.E.2d at 352-53 (even under business judgment rule, action of corporation must be in accordance with law and corporate powers); <em>cf. Bank of Giles County </em>v. <em>Mason, </em>199 Va. 176, 181-82, 98 S.E.2d 905, 908 (1957) (court determines whether shareholder\u2019s exercise of common-law right to inspect corporate documents is made in good faith after corporation rejects request).</p>\n<p id=\"b589-6\">Therefore, we reject LMOA\u2019s contention that the presumption set forth in the business judgment rule should be applied when deciding whether LMOA properly construed its bylaws in disqualifying the proposals. This brings us to a consideration of the correctness of LMOA\u2019s construction of \u00a7 4.08(c)(1) and (6) in disqualifying these proposals. In deciding this issue, we are not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"572\">*572</page-number>concerned with the advisability or wisdom of the proposals, but only with whether Code \u00a7 55-315 and \u00a7 4.08 of the bylaws give Lake the right to submit these proposals to a vote of his fellow members of LMOA.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-4\">LMOA asserts a number of contentions in support of its argument that its board correctly rejected these proposals. For the reasons which follow, we find no merit in any of these contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b590-5\">First, LMOA asserts that the members\u2019 right to amend LMOA\u2019s bylaws is \u201cconfined to matters such as conduct of meetings, elections of directors and officers, duties of officers and committees and other matters of internal concern\u201d and does not include \u201cany mundane detail relating to the day-to-day activities of the Association\u201d or \u201cthe making of corporate policy and management decisions (such as, whether the security guards are deputized or setting green fees for the golf course.)\u201d In this case, however, we are not dealing with bylaw amendments of an ordinary corporation; rather, we are faced with specific statutory rights allowing LMOA members to amend or repeal LMOA\u2019s rules and regulations \u201cwith respect to use of the common areas and with respect to such other areas of responsibility assigned to the association by the declaration.\u201d Code \u00a7 55-513(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b590-6\">With the exception of the third proposal herein that seeks to amend \u00a7 10.03 of the bylaws, the remaining proposals all seek to amend rules and regulations of LMOA. These rules and regulations either restrict the future conduct of members and their invitees in the exercise of their rights in the community (guest cards or passes, green fees, and display of their homes for future sale) or subject their conduct to the control of LMOA\u2019s employees or agents (appointment of LMOA\u2019s security officers as special policemen). As such, the proposals either deal with the members\u2019 use of parts of the common area or LMOA\u2019s responsibilities in enforcing the declaration-imposed obligations upon each member to comply with LMOA\u2019s articles and bylaw provisions or suffer the penalties imposed by LMOA.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, we think that Code \u00a7 55-513 authorizes members to suggest these proposals.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"573\">*573</page-number>LMOA next argues that some of the proposals seek to amend its statements of policy, not its rules and regulations. However, if a policy of a governing body is binding upon the future conduct of its members, it is treated as a rule or regulation. <em>See Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. </em>v. <em>United States, </em>316 U.S. 407, 422 (1942) (order promulgating policy announcement, accompanied by statement that administrative agency would \u201cfollow\u201d order is regulation within meaning of federal statute); <em>cf. Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. </em>v. <em>Federal Power Comm\u2019n, </em>506 F.2d 33, 38 (D.C. Cir. 1974) (\u201cA general statement of policy . . . does not establish a \u2018binding norm.\u2019 ... A policy statement announces the agency\u2019s tentative intentions for the future\u201d). Because these alleged policies bind the future conduct of LMOA\u2019s members and provide penalties for their violation, we conclude that each proposal at issue here seeks to amend a rule or regulation within the meaning of Code \u00a7 55-513.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-4\">Nevertheless, citing <em>Kaplan </em>v. <em>Block, </em>183 Va. 327, 332, 31 S.E.2d 893, 895 (1944), LMOA contends that such proposals cannot divest the board of its duty of management and control by creating a \u201csterilized board of directors.\u201d Importantly, <em>Kaplan </em>is inapposite because it involved a stock corporation, not a nonstock corporation that is subject to the Property Owners\u2019 Association Act. Moreover, in contrast to <em>Kaplan, </em>the present proposals do not create a \u201csterilized board\u201d in which <em>every </em>action of the board has to be approved by the members. <em>Id. </em>at 335, 31 S.E.2d at 896.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-5\">Given the language of Code \u00a7 55-513 and the fact that LMOA members must submit to these rules, regulations, and binding policies as long as they own homes in Lake Monticello, we think the proposals, if enacted by majority vote, would merely impose limitations upon the board\u2019s powers authorized by this code section. Accordingly, we conclude that the board of directors erred in excluding these proposals from the proxy statement. Although we will reverse that part of the trial court\u2019s judgment finding bylaw \u00a7 4.08(c)(1) and (6) invalid, we will enter a declaratory judgment in favor of Lake consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b591-6\">\n<em>Affirmed in part, reversed in part, and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b586-7\"> Code \u00a755-513(A) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<p id=\"b586-8\">The board of directors of the association shall have the power to establish, adopt, and enforce rules and regulations with respect to use of the common areas and with respect to such other areas of responsibility assigned to the association by the declaration .... A majority of votes cast, in person or by proxy, at a meeting convened in accordance with the provisions of the association\u2019s bylaws and called for that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>purpose, shall repeal or amend any rule or regulation adopted by the board of directors.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b588-8\"> LMOA stipulated that Lake was a proper party to bring the action.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b588-9\"> Lake filed no reply brief and thus did not make an oral argument. Rule 5:33.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b590-7\"> To the extent that LMOA\u2019s duly adopted rules and regulations expressly so provide, Code \u00a7 55-513(B) gives LMOA\u2019s board of directors the right to assess charges against members for violation of LMOA\u2019s rules and regulations. Since the part of LMOA\u2019s policy manual that is in the record contains a schedule of charges and penalties for violations of LMOA\u2019s rules and regulations, we assume that LMOA\u2019s rules and regulations provide for imposition of such charges and penalties.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
