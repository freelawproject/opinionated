Although these separate areas were apparently conveyed to the community association at different times, they were collectively described as the \u201ccommon area\u201d of the development.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">The common area was to be owned by the community association \u201cfor the benefit, use and enjoyment of the [lot] [o]wners,\u201d to whom the developer granted \u201ca non-exclusive right and easement of use and enjoyment.\u201d In February 1991, the developer conveyed Parcel G, Section IB of Lee\u2019s Hill to the community association as part of the common area and apparently as \u201copen space.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Parcel G is a long, narrow, triangular strip of land lying generally south of land owned by Mary Lee Carter and Walter L. Carter, Jr., the parents of Ralph Dewayne Carter, and fronting the north side of Amelia Street. The somewhat incomplete and unsatisfactory record in this appeal does not fully describe Parcel G. It merely shows that Parcel G has a depth of 58.66 feet on its western boundary and narrows continuously to its eastern boundary, but does not specify the lengths of Parcel G\u2019s boundary with the Carters\u2019 land or of its frontage on Amelia Street.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-7\">After the developer\u2019s conveyance of Parcel G to the community association, various lot owners and their families used it for walking or jogging, sled riding, and as a place to congregate and visit with neighbors. The lot owners also regarded this common area as an aesthetically pleasing \u201cgreen space\u201d separating the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>subdivision property from \u201ca very busy road.\u201d At a time not shown in the record, the lot owners formed an unincorporated association known as \u201cLee\u2019s Hill Homeowners\u201d to protect their individual rights \u201cin a collective fashion.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b572-5\">In May 1994, the community association conveyed 0.0479 acres of Parcel G to the developer in exchange for the developer\u2019s conveyance to the community association of 0.48489 acres located elsewhere in the development as a substitute common area. Lying immediately south of the Carter land, the 0.0479 acre parcel (Parcel G-2) begins 76.93 feet east of Parcel G\u2019s western boundary, fronts 62.10 feet on the north side of Amelia Street, and extends 40.67 feet and 29.91 feet, respectively, on its western and eastern boundaries.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-6\">Immediately thereafter, the developer conveyed Parcel G-2 to Ralph Dewayne Carter and Robin Keith Carter (the Carters), who had acquired part of his parents\u2019 land immediately north of Parcel G-2. Later, the Carters began to construct two driveways across Parcel G-2 to serve a house they had moved to the land north of Parcel G-2. Whereupon, \u201cLee\u2019s Hill Homeowners\u201d and Kelly M. Boehringer, a lot owner, (collectively the lot owners) filed this suit against the Carters to enjoin their construction and use of the driveways as an interference with their easements in Parcel G, including Parcel G-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-7\">Following an <em>ore terms </em>hearing, the chancellor sustained the Carters\u2019 motion to strike the lot owners\u2019 evidence on the grounds that (1) the terms of the declaration gave the community association and the developer the right to exchange one part of the common area for another part, and (2) the lot owners had failed to show that their easements were \u201cmaterially and adversely affect [ed]\u201d by the exchange. The lot owners appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-8\">In conformity with well-established appellate principles, we have viewed the facts in the light most favorable to the lot owners since the chancellor struck their evidence without hearing the Carters\u2019 evidence. <em>Ward v. Ernst &amp; Young, </em>246 Va. 317, 330, 435 S.E.2d 628, 634-35 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-9\">The parties agree that the lot owners had easements in Parcel G-2 that were appurtenant to their lots. They disagree as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>to whether those easements were terminated upon the community association\u2019s conveyance to the developer. Our decision is controlled by the provisions of the developer\u2019s declaration and the principle that if the pertinent terms of a written instrument are clear and unambiguous, as we believe they are in this case, we do not resort to rules of construction. <em>State Farm Fire and Casualty Co. </em>v. <em>Walton, </em>244 Va. 498, 502, 423 S.E.2d 188, 191 (1992). Instead, we apply those terms as written. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b573-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">The lot owners assert that the provisions of \u00a7 3.8 of the declaration prohibit this exchange of a part of the common area for another part located elsewhere in the development. Section 3.8 provides that each lot owner\u2019s easement in the common area is \u201cappurtenant to each Lot\u201d and further provides that \u201c[a]ny purported conveyance or other transfer of such rights and easements <em>apart from the Lot to which such rights and easements are appurtenant </em>shall be void.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Clearly, this provision is a prohibition against a lot owner\u2019s attempted conveyance of these easements <em>apart </em>from a conveyance of the lot, not a prohibition against the developer\u2019s transfer of these easements appurtenant to each lot to another part of the common area, the situation in this case. Thus, we find no merit in this assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-6\">Next, the lot owners contend that the declaration gives the developer no clear and unambiguous right to extinguish their easements in Parcel G-2 by reacquiring that parcel and conveying it to the Carters. They further contend that since the easements were incapable of being extinguished, the developer\u2019s conveyance of fee simple title to the Carters could not remove the burden imposed upon Parcel G-2 by their recorded, perpetual easements.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-7\">In response, the Carters assert that the developer\u2019s right to extinguish the lot owners\u2019 easements in Parcel G-2 is clearly and unambiguously set forth in \u00a7\u00a7 2.4 and 2.6 of the declaration. They also assert that the terms of the declaration do not create perpetual easements specifically in Parcel G-2, but rather easements that may be shifted to other parcels of land within the development.</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">First, we consider whether the developer had a right to reacquire Parcel G-2 and convey it to the Carters. Section 2.4 of the declaration gives the community association the power to \u201cconvey the Common Area owned in fee simple by the Associa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>tion . . . subject to [approval by any mortgagees of the property].\u201d Also, \u00a7 2.6 provides that the community association can \u201ctransfer part of the Common Area to or at the direction of the [developer] for the purpose of adjusting Lot lines or otherwise in connection with the orderly subdivision and development of the Property.\u201d However, if the minimum level of \u201copen space\u201d is reduced by any such transfer, \u00a7 2.6 requires the developer to convey to the community association such portion of its property as is necessary to maintain that minimum level of \u201copen space.\u201d In our opinion, these provisions clearly gave the community association the right to convey Parcel G-2 to the developer and permitted the developer to convey this land to the Carters, provided that the developer conveyed to the community association other property necessary to maintain the minimum level of \u201copen space,\u201d which it did. Thus, we reject the contention that the developer was barred from reacquiring Parcel G-2 and conveying that parcel to the Carters.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-4\">Next, we consider whether the lot owners\u2019 easements in Parcel G-2 were perpetual and, therefore, incapable of being extinguished by these conveyances. Looking at the language of the declaration, we note that the easements are described as a \u201cnonexclusive right and easement of use and enjoyment in and to the Common Area . . . .\u201d The declaration does not describe any particular part of the common area, which, under the terms of the declaration, is defined as \u201call of the Property, other than Lots, then owned or leased by the Association or otherwise available to the Association for the benefit, use and enjoyment of the Owners.\u201d And, as we have held, the developer and community association reserved the right under \u00a7\u00a7 2.4 and 2.6 of the declaration to exchange and, thereafter, to convey parts of the common area in the orderly subdivision and development of the property, provided that the developer maintained the minimum \u201copen space\u201d of each subdivision of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">Accordingly, we do not think that the lot owners\u2019 easements are affixed to a particular parcel of land, as the lot owners claim, but can be shifted from time to time to other parcels of land duly conveyed to the community association. Hence, we conclude that the community association and the developer had the right to make this exchange of parts of the common area and to extinguish the lot owners\u2019 specific easements in Parcel G-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-5\">We next consider the lot owners\u2019 claim that the evidence that their easements in the balance of Parcel G were affected by the conveyance of Parcel G-2 raised factual issues which could not be resolved on a motion to strike.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-6\">First, the lot owners cite the common law rule that a servient owner cannot use his property in such manner as to make the dominant owner\u2019s use of an easement less useful or convenient. <em>Willing v. Booker, </em>160 Va. 461, 466, 168 S.E. 417, 419 (1933). However, as the Carters note, the lot owners acquired their easements in Parcel G subject to the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 2.4 and 2.6 of the declaration giving the servient owners the right to transfer the lot owners\u2019 easements in one part of the common area to another part of the common area. And the lot owners introduced no evidence comparing the relative usefulness and convenience of Parcel G and the substituted part of the common area.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Accordingly, the lot owners failed to carry their burden of showing that their use of the substituted part of the common area was less convenient or useful than their use of Parcel G or its remainder after the conveyance of Parcel G-2.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-7\">Next, the lot owners rely upon \u00a7 15.1(3) of the declaration. Section 15.1(3) deals with the developer\u2019s unilateral right to \u201crelocate boundary lines between the Common Area and any Lots or among any Lots; <em>provided, however, </em>that such relocation does not materially and adversely affect any Owner other than the [developer] and that such relocation is reflected in an approved resubdivision of all or any part of the Property.\u201d The lot owners claim that their evidence raised a factual issue whether their easements in Parcel G were \u201cmaterially and adversely affected.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b575-8\">The difficulty with this claim is twofold. First, \u00a7 15.1(3) deals only with the developer\u2019s unilateral right to relocate lot boundaries. Here, there is no relocation of boundary lines, particularly those of the complaining lot owners, but a conveyance of a part of the common area. Second, as we have noted earlier, the lot owners introduced no evidence addressing the relative usefulness or convenience of their easements in the former and substituted parts of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>the common area. Hence, we find no merit in the lot owners\u2019 contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-5\">Accordingly, we will affirm the final decree of the chancellor.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b571-8\"> The declaration does not define the term \u201copen space,\u201d nor does the deed to the community association indicate that the land conveyed was to be treated as part of the open space. However, the witnesses and counsel for the lot owners described that land as \u201cgreen space\u201d or \u201copen space.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b572-10\"> The only indication of the formation and purpose of \u201cLee\u2019s Hill Homeowners\u201d is in the averments of the bill of complaint, which are denied in the Carters\u2019 answer to the bill of complaint. However, the Carters have not questioned the right of the homeowners association to participate in the suit and this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b575-9\"> In describing another part of the common area, Roger Dressier, a lot owner, testified that \u201cone other strip of land that\u2019s off Amelia Drive [was] behind some other houses, and . . . inaccessible by us,\u201d but he did not identify that strip of land as the substituted part of the common area.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
