As a result of the accident, the Green Thumb vehicle was damaged and its driver and a passenger, also an employee of Green Thumb, were injured. Carr\u2019s liability insurance carrier denied coverage. Green Thumb sought uninsured motorist coverage from its insurer, The Home Insurance Company (Home). Home settled with Green Thumb paying it $29,500 for personal injuries suffered by the employees.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b446-13\">Two years and six days after the accident, Home filed a motion for judgment against Carr alleging that Carr\u2019s negligence caused the accident. Home, as Green Thumb\u2019s subrogee, sought recovery of the \u201camount paid by them on behalf of their insured as a result of [Carr\u2019s] negligence.\u201d Carr filed a plea of the statute of limitations asserting that the action was untimely because, as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>Green Thumb\u2019s subrogee, Home was required to bring the action within the two-year period prescribed for personal injury actions in Code \u00a7 8.01-243(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">Prior to consideration of Carr\u2019s plea, Home was allowed to file an amended motion for judgment seeking recovery against Carr based on \u201ccontribution and/or implied or equitable indemnification.\u201d Thereafter, the trial court denied Carr\u2019s plea, finding that Home\u2019s motion for judgment was timely filed because actions for contribution or indemnification accrue at the time \u201cthe contributee or the indemnitee has paid or discharged the obligation.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.01-249(5). The trial court subsequently granted Home\u2019s motion for summary judgment and entered judgment against Carr. We awarded Carr an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">Carr asserts here, as she did below, that the facts of the case did not support Home\u2019s claim for equitable indemnification and that Home\u2019s sole cause of action against her was a personal injury action as Green Thumb\u2019s subrogee.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We agree. Equitable indemnification arises when a party without personal fault, is nevertheless legally liable for damages caused by the negligence of another. Equitable principles allow the innocent party to recover from the negligent actor for the amounts paid to discharge the liability. <em>Maryland Casualty Co. v. Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., </em>191 Va. 225, 232, 60 S.E.2d 876, 879 (1950); <em>McLaughlin </em>v. <em>Siegel, </em>166 Va. 374, 377, 185 S.E. 873, 874 (1936).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">A prerequisite to recovery based on equitable indemnification is the initial determination that the negligence of another person caused the damage. Without that determination, neither the negligent actor nor the innocent party can be held liable for the damages claimed. In this case, at the time Home filed its motion for judgment, there had been no determination that Carr\u2019s actions were negligent or that her negligence caused the damages claimed by Green Thumb. Consequently, the elements necessary to support equitable indemnification in favor of Home were not met.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">Under the circumstances of this case, the only cognizable cause of action available to Home was that of subrogation as provided in Code \u00a7 38.2-2206(G). <em>See United Servs. Auto. Ass\u2019n </em>v. <em>Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., </em>218 Va. 861, 867, 241 S.E.2d 784, 788 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>(1978). Home did not bring its action seeking recovery from Carr within the two year limitation period for personal injury actions. Therefore, the trial court erred in denying Carr\u2019s plea of the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">Accordingly, the judgment of the trial court will be reversed and final judgment entered dismissing Home\u2019s claim for amounts paid for personal injuries sustained by Green Thumb\u2019s employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b446-14\"> Home also paid Green Thumb $4,210 for property damage and towing charges. Recovery of these amounts is not involved in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b447-8\"> Home abandoned its claim based on contribution. Although Home refers to implied indemnification, it uses that term interchangeably with equitable indemnification and does not argue that there was an implied contract of indemnification between Carr and Home.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
