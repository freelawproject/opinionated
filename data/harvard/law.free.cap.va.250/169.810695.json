The route crosses one corner of a farm owned by E. Tyree Chappell. Approximately half of the farm lies in a flood plain. The corner crossed by the easement is cleared land and, with access to State Route 637, is suitable for residential development. Chappell\u2019s farm contains 91.72 acres; the easement will cover 0.85 of an acre.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-3\">In preparation for trial, Chappell served a subpoena on Donald E. Koonce, Vepco\u2019s Director of Transmission Operations. In response to interrogatories, Chappell advised that he also planned to call another witness, Gillis G. Pratt, Jr., a real estate appraiser, who would opine that \u201cthe greatest loss to the property is the damages to the remainder . . . [which] is significantly devalued, because of its proximity to the right of way of a high voltage transmission line, including the public awareness and fear of living in the vicinity of electromagnetic fields caused by such transmission lines.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">Vepco filed a motion to quash the Koonce subpoena and a motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude \u201cevidence of or reference to electromagnetic fields (\u2018EMF\u2019), any alleged link between EMF and adverse human health effects, any alleged public perception of any such link, and the effects, if any, of any such perception on property values in Hanover County.\u201d The trial court granted both motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">Following a view of the property by the court and the commissioners, Vepco introduced the testimony of a single witness, Michael C. McCall, a real estate appraiser. McCall fixed the value of the easement at $11,900; the damage to an \u201c80-foot strip running along the easement\u201d at $22,155; no damage to the residue outside this \u201cbuffer strip\u201d; and total just compensation at $34,100.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Chappell, testifying as his only witness, valued the easement at $12,750; damage to the residue at $81,750; and total just compensation at $94,500. For the record, Chappell proffered the testimony of Gillis Pratt, a real estate appraiser. Pratt evaluated the easement at $14,445; damage to the residue at $65,555; and total just compensation at $80,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">The trial court entered judgment confirming the commissioners\u2019 report which assessed the value of the easement at $12,325; damage to the residue at $25,655; and total just compensation at $37,980.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>In his challenge on appeal to the quantum of the award of damage to the residue, Chappell contends that the trial court erred in excluding his evidence of public fear emanating from the presence of high voltage power lines and the effect of that fear on the market value of his property. He relies upon language contained in <em>Appalachian Pr. Co. </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>137 Va. 12, 30-31, 119 S.E. 253, 258 (1923), where we said that \u201cthe commissioners could have properly taken into consideration the effect of the fear of the [transmission] line breaking down and injuring persons and property ... if the liability [for] such injury in fact depreciated the market value of the property.\u201d Chappell insists that the trial court\u2019s order excluding his evidence from consideration by the commissioners \u201cwas in contravention of precedent and resulted in unfair prejudice ... as reflected by the Commissioners\u2019 award.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">We do not agree that <em>Johnson </em>is controlling precedent. The landowner was awarded nothing for damage to the residue; damage to the residue was not an issue before this Court; and the language Chappell invokes is <em>obiter dicta.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">Nevertheless, we need not decide whether a landowner in a proceeding to condemn an easement for an electric transmission line may be entitled to compensation for diminution in the market value of the remaining land attributable to the fears of prospective purchasers. The rule is well settled that, \u201c[i]n every eminent domain case involving a partial taking, the measure of damages to the residue of the property not taken is the difference in the fair market value immediately before and immediately after the taking.\u201d <em>East Tennessee Natural Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Riner, </em>239 Va. 94, 100, 387 S.E.2d 476, 479 (1990); <em>accord Town of Rocky Mount </em>v. <em>Hudson, </em>244 Va. 271, 273, 421 S.E.2d 407, 408 (1992). And, as Chappell acknowledges on brief, \u201c[speculative matters should not be considered by commissioners in determining just compensation.\u201d Applying these principles, we examine the probative value of the damage evidence Chappell vouched for the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">Koonce, Vepco\u2019s employee, was never asked to evaluate damage to the residue, and Pratt produced no evidence of comparable sales consummated at prices allegedly diminished by public fear of electric transmission lines. As Chappell agreed in oral argument, \u201c [i]t is difficult to prove market value loss when there are no actual sales of comparable property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b190-7\">In support of his estimate of damage to the residue, Pratt referred to an article he had read in the \u201cJournal of Real Estate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>Research\u201d. Based upon \u201ca survey of several experienced appraisers all over the country,\u201d the author of the article concluded that the effect of high voltage power lines on residential property values \u201cranged from zero to 50 percent difference . . . with the median being typically something greater than 10 percent\u201d. While Pratt testified that he applied a 10 percent depreciation formula to one parcel containing 13.77 acres \u201cbecause of the visual\u201d problem, it is unclear from the record what percentage factor or factors related to the fears of prospective customers he applied to other portions of the rest of Chappell\u2019s farm.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-4\">We think that the proffered testimony failed to quantify any damage to the fair market value of the residue attributable to the alleged public fear of high voltage transmission lines. Consequently, the testimony Chappell proffered was inadmissible. <em>East Tennessee Natural Gas Co. </em>v. <em>Riner, 239 </em>Va. at 100, 387 S.E.2d at 479-80.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">Finally, Chappell complains that the trial court erred in denying his \u201cabsolute right of cross-examination\u201d and that \u201c[d]ue to the Court\u2019s evidentiary rulings, the Commissioners\u2019 award was arrived at under erroneous principles and should have been overturned by the Trial Court\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">On cross-examination, Chappell\u2019s counsel asked McCall if, during the course of his testimony in earlier Vepco condemnation cases, \u201cthe question [had] come up about fear of power lines\u201d. The trial court, taking the view that Chappell\u2019s question was within the intendment of the exclusion order entered <em>in limine, </em>sustained Vepco\u2019s objection to the question, and Chappell\u2019s counsel resumed interrogation on a different subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">\u201cWe will not consider testimony which the trial court has excluded without a proper showing of what that testimony might have been.\u201d <em>O\u2019Dell </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>234 Va. 672, 697, 364 S.E.2d 491, 505 <em>cert. denied, </em>488 U.S. 871 (1988). \u201c[W]hen testimony is rejected before it is delivered, an appellate court has no basis for adjudication unless the record reflects a proper proffer.\u201d <em>Whittaker </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 966, 968, 234 S.E.2d 79, 81 (1977); <em>accord Spencer </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>238 Va. 563, 570, 385 S.E.2d 850, 854 (1989), <em>cert. denied </em>493 U.S. 1093 (1990); <em>MacKall </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>236 Va. 240, 256-57, 372 S.E.2d 759, 769 (1988), <em>cert. denied </em>492 U.S. 925 (1989); <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>231 Va. 102, 108, 341 S.E.2d 190, 194 (1986); <em>Wyche </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 839, 842, 241 S.E.2d 772, 774 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>(1978); <em>Owens </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>147 Va. 624, 630-31, 136 S.E. 765, 767 (1927); <em>Jackson\u2019s Case, </em>98 Va. 845, 846-47, 36 S.E. 487, 488 (1900). Although the trial court invited Chappell to pursue his right of \u201cvouching the record\u201d, we find nothing in that record that constitutes a proper proffer.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">The commissioners\u2019 award was lower than the highest damage estimates and higher than the lowest.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-5\">It is a well settled rule of law in this State that it requires strong evidence to warrant the appellate court in setting aside an award of commissioners when the only exception is to the <em>quantum </em>of damages.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-6\"><em>Chairman Highway </em>v. <em>Fletcher, </em>153 Va. 43, 46, 149 S.E. 456, 457 (1929); <em>accord Highway Commissioner </em>v. <em>Carter, </em>216 Va. 639, 641, 222 S.E.2d 776, <em>111 </em>(1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">We hold that the record fails to show that the difference between the market value of the residue immediately before and immediately after the condemnation was greater than the award the commissioners made, and we will affirm the judgment of the trial court confirming the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
