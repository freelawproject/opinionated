Schultz and Marilyn S. Schultz, husband and wife, both certified public accountants, were the sole shareholders, directors, and officers of an accounting firm organized as a Virginia professional corporation, Gerald A. Schultz &amp; Associates, P.C., Inc. Gerald and Marilyn are also litigants in an acrimonious divorce proceeding in the Circuit Court of Middlesex County. The chronology of events in these two suits is important.</p>\n<p id=\"b140-15\">The divorce court entered a decree that prohibited Gerald and Marilyn from transferring any assets out of the marital estate. The divorce court appointed a \u201cspecial master\u201d who determined that the fair market value of Gerald A. Schultz &amp; Associates was $500,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>Gerald filed this dissolution suit pursuant to Code \u00a7 13.1-747 against Gerald A. Schultz &amp; Associates, after the divorce court had entered the decree prohibiting him from transferring assets out of the marital estate. Marilyn was not a named party in this suit. The dissolution court conducted an <em>ore terms </em>hearing, considered the testimony of several witnesses, including Marilyn, and held that the corporation\u2019s board of directors was \u201cdeadlocked.\u201d The dissolution court dissolved the corporation and appointed a receiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">Subsequently, Marilyn filed a motion to intervene. She asserted that Gerald sought relief against her personally and that the dissolution suit was filed to circumvent the divorce court\u2019s order which had prohibited him from transferring any marital assets. She also requested in her motion that the court reconsider its order dissolving the corporation, and she sought a dismissal of the order of dissolution. The dissolution court did not adjudicate her motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">Marilyn also filed a motion in the divorce proceeding, requesting that the divorce court hold Gerald in contempt of court for violating that court\u2019s order enjoining the transfer of any marital assets. The divorce court informed the dissolution court, by letter, that the value of the corporation was an issue in the divorce proceeding, and that it had enjoined Marilyn and Gerald from transferring any property out of the marital estate. The dissolution court, by letter, assured the divorce court that \u201cno further Orders or proceedings will be conducted\u201d in the dissolution suit until all matters were resolved in the divorce proceeding or with the concurrence of the divorce court.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">Subsequently, without notice to Marilyn or the divorce court, the dissolution court entered an \u201corder approving plan of reorganization and dissolution and compelling production of documents and information.\u201d Marilyn filed a motion requesting that the dissolution court vacate that order. That court denied the motion, and we awarded Marilyn an appeal.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b141-7\">Marilyn argued in her motion to vacate, and asserts on appeal, that the dissolution court erred by entering an order to dissolve Gerald A. Schultz &amp; Associates because, pursuant to Code \u00a7 13.1-747(D), she is a necessary party in a suit to dissolve the corporation. Gerald argues that the dissolution court \u201cproperly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>took no action on Mrs. Schultz\u2019s Motion to Intervene and made no error in neglecting to include her as a party defendant.\u201d We disagree with Gerald.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Code \u00a7 13.1-747 authorizes a circuit court to dissolve a corporation for certain enumerated reasons including, under certain circumstances, a deadlock in the board of directors. Code \u00a7 13.1-747(D) states: \u201cIt is not necessary to make directors or shareholders parties to a proceeding to be brought under this section unless relief is sought against them individually.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">Gerald alleged, in his bill of complaint, that there were only two shareholders in the corporation, that each shareholder owned 50% of the outstanding shares, and that the directors were \u201cdeadlocked.\u201d Gerald asked that the court \u201cdissolve the defendant corporation . . . appoint a receiver, and issue such injunctions and orders as may be necessary to preserve corporate assets, and [grant] such further relief as the case may require.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">The dissolution court granted the relief that Gerald had requested by entering an order approving the plan of dissolution. That order granted Gerald relief against Marilyn individually in numerous respects. The order directed that Marilyn cooperate with the receiver and provided that she \u201cshall execute such documents, agreements and instruments and produce to the Receiver in a prompt manner all documents and information requested by the Receiver in connection with the Plan [or] implementation of the Plan.\u201d The plan also provided for the formation of a new corporation in which Marilyn would be the sole shareholder. The plan imposed numerous obligations upon Marilyn and her court-ordered new corporation, one of which is to require the corporation to indemnify and hold Gerald A. Schultz &amp; Associates harmless from certain claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">Certainly, under these facts, Marilyn is a necessary party against whom relief was both sought and granted individually in this suit. And, as we have said, \u201ca court cannot render a valid judgment when necessary parties to a proceeding are not before the court.\u201d <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Chapman, </em>242 Va. 94, 99, 406 S.E.2d 186, 188 (1991); <em>McDougle </em>v. <em>McDougle, </em>214 Va. 636, 637, 203 S.E.2d 131, 133 (1974). Therefore, we hold that the dissolution court erred by failing to grant Marilyn\u2019s motion to vacate the dissolution order.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-9\">Accordingly, we will reverse the judgment of the dissolution court. We will direct the dissolution court to vacate the order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>approving the plan of reorganization and dissolution and compelling production of documents and information. We will also direct the dissolution court to enter an order granting Marilyn\u2019s motion to intervene. Additionally, as we previously observed, the value of Gerald A. Schultz &amp; Associates is an issue involved in the divorce proceeding in Middlesex County. Therefore, we will direct the dissolution court to stay all proceedings in the dissolution suit until the divorce proceeding is final.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b141-8\"> We find no merit in Gerald\u2019s contention that Marilyn\u2019s appeal is not timely.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
