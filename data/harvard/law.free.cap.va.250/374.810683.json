About 12:00 noon on that day, Parker and two other employees were planting winter cabbages at the development\u2019s entrance adjacent to Long Hill Road. At that time, one Allen Byran Healy lost control of a motor vehicle he was operating on the Road and struck Parker, injuring her.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-11\">Subsequently, Parker filed a personal injury action against Healy seeking recovery in damages as the result of his wrongful conduct. The vehicle operated by Healy was underinsured.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-12\">Later, appellant United States Fire Insurance Company filed the present declaratory judgment suit naming Parker a defendant, among others. The insurer had issued a \u201cBusiness Auto Policy\u201d covering the Ford\u2019s Colony pickup truck that had been driven by Parker to the site where she was working at the time of the injury. This liability policy provided underinsurance motorist coverage in accordance with Code \u00a7 38.2-2206, the uninsured motorist statute. Asserting that Parker claimed underinsured coverage under its policy, the insurer asked the trial court to declare that the policy did not provide such coverage for Parker in her claim against Healy.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-13\">As pertinent, Code \u00a7 38.2-2206 provides that no policy of bodily injury or property damage liability insurance \u201crelating to the ownership, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle\u201d shall be issued in the Commonwealth unless it contains provisions undertaking to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>pay \u201cthe insured all sums that he is legally entitled to recover as damages\u201d from the operator of an uninsured or underinsured motor vehicle. Code \u00a7 38.2-2206(B) defines the term \u201cinsured\u201d as \u201cany person who uses the motor vehicle to which the policy applies, with the expressed or implied consent of the named insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">Following an evidentiary hearing, the trial court ruled in favor of Parker. We awarded the insurer this appeal from the September 1994 order declaring that the insurer must provide underinsured motorist coverage in the event Parker obtains a judgment in excess of $25,000, the amount of Healy\u2019s coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">The facts are not in dispute. On the day in question, Parker and her co-workers used the Ford\u2019s Colony pickup truck, with Parker driving, to carry them and the cabbages to the worksite and to transport a rake, trowel, and shovels they needed to perform the task of planting the cabbages. A two-way radio was installed in the truck; they were required to leave the radio \u201con\u201d at all times enabling them to receive messages from their supervisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">At the site, the trio worked as a team performing specific tasks directed by Parker. She was to dig holes for the plants, another worker unloaded the cabbages, and the third worker planted the cabbages.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-7\">Although not directed to do so by their supervisor, they parked the truck at the site in such a position as to provide a \u201csafety barrier\u201d to protect them from speeding motorists. They left a door of the truck open while planting the cabbages so they could hear the radio.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-8\">At the time of the accident, Healy\u2019s speeding vehicle left the paved portion of the Road, struck the truck, and then struck Parker as she was digging a hole in a flower bed 12 to 15 feet from the truck. The workers had not completed their task; some plants remained in the truck and they needed to clean up the area.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-9\">In two prior cases dealing with vehicle \u201cuse,\u201d we considered the foregoing statutory provisions. In <em>Insurance Company of North America </em>v. <em>Perry, </em>204 Va. 833, 134 S.E.2d 418 (1964), the question was whether the permissive user of an insured vehicle was provided protection in the uninsured motorist statute against an injury that occurs to one \u201cwhile using\u201d such vehicle. <em>Id. </em>at 838, 134 S.E.2d at 421. In <em>Great American Insurance Co. </em>v. <em>Cassell, </em>239 Va. 421, 389 S.E.2d 476 (1990), we said the issue was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>whether the victim\u2019s death \u201carose out of the \u2018use\u2019 of\u2019 the insured vehicle. <em>Id. </em>at 423, 389 S.E.2d at 477.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">Portraying the issue in the present case to be \u201cwhether Parker was using the truck at the time of her accident,\u201d the trial court concluded that Parker\u2019s activities constituted \u201cuse\u201d of the vehicle for purposes of the statutory provisions. To support this conclusion, the court relied upon the facts that Parker remained close to the truck and the work had not been completed; also, the truck was being used as a barrier, to load and unload the plants, and for communication with the supervisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Whether the issue is framed as \u201cwhile using\u201d or \u201carose out of the use of,\u201d the crucial inquiry is: Was there a causal relationship between the incident and the employment of the insured vehicle as a vehicle? <em>See Travelers Ins. Co. </em>v. LaClair, 250 Va. 368, 372, 463 S.E.2d 461, 464 (1995), decided today.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">In <em>Perry, </em>the deceased claimant, a police officer engaged in the act of serving a warrant, was on foot 164 feet away from his parked police cruiser, the insured vehicle. There, we held that the officer\u2019s fatal injury did not occur while he was using the vehicle. \u201cHe was not then under the canopy of the coverage\u201d provided by the uninsured motorist statute. 204 Va. at 838, 134 S.E.2d at 421.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">In contrast, we concluded in <em>Cassell </em>that the deceased claimant, a fire fighter, was an insured for purposes of the statutory uninsured motorist coverage. There, fire fighters parked a pumper truck and a tanker truck, the insured vehicles, on a city street near a disabled car that was on fire. The deceased, senior officer in charge, rode to the scene in the pumper truck that was parked with its lights burning 20 to 25 feet from the car.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-8\">The fire trucks were being used to restrict or influence the flow of traffic and to provide a protective barrier for the fire fighters. A fire hose connected to the deceased\u2019s pumper truck was used to extinguish the fire; the water came from the truck rather than from a street hydrant. The deceased used a crowbar he had taken from the pumper truck to open the hood of the disabled car.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">While standing in the street approximately 20 to 25 feet from his truck, and while completing a required report using a clipboard from his truck, the deceased was killed by a hit-and-run driver. Other fire fighters were reloading equipment into the deceased\u2019s truck at the time of the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">Notably, we said that employment of the fire truck \u201cto extinguish the fire, control traffic and protect the fire fighters, including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>[the deceased], was an integral part of the fire fighters\u2019 mission. The mission had not been completed when the accident occurred. Unlike the police officer in <em>Perry, </em>[the deceased] was engaged in a transaction essential to the use of the fire truck when he was killed.\u201d 239 Va. at 424, 389 S.E.2d at 477.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">Unlike the deceased in <em>Cassell, </em>the claimant in the present case was not engaged in a transaction essential to the use of the pickup truck when she was injured. In other words, she was not utilizing the truck as a vehicle at that time. She was 12 to 15 feet away from the truck with her foot on a shovel in the act of digging a hole when struck.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">The facts that the workers, independently and not because of any requirement by Ford\u2019s Colony, positioned the truck (which had no special, emergency warning lights) as a barrier, and that the radio was operating at the time (it could not be heard unless the workers were \u201cin close proximity\u201d to it), does not bring this case within the <em>Cassell </em>precedent. In <em>Cassell, </em>the fire truck\u2019s lights were burning, a hose connected to the truck used water carried on the truck to extinguish the fire, and emergency vehicles suitable for use to control traffic were utilized as barriers at the scene. Here, the truck merely was used as a means of transportation so that Parker could complete her landscaping duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">Consequently, we hold that the court below erred. The trial court\u2019s order will be reversed and final judgment will be entered here in favor of the insurer declaring that it does not owe underinsured motorist coverage to Parker under the statutorily mandated provisions of its insurance contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">\n<em>Reversed and final judgment.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
