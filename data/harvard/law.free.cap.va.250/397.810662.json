The dispositive issue in this appeal is whether, under the facts and circumstances of this case, the demand of a cash proffer by the Board of Supervisors of Powhatan County (the Board) violates Code \u00a7 15.1-491.2:1.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">Reed\u2019s Landing Corporation (the Developer) filed a petition for declaratory judgment against the Board, seeking a declaration that the Board unlawfully denied the Developer\u2019s rezoning application. The Developer alleged that the Board unlawfully conditioned the rezoning upon a proffer of a cash payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-8\">After hearing the evidence <em>ore tenus, </em>the trial court found that the Board did act unlawfully by conditioning the rezoning upon the proffer of a cash payment and directed the Board to reconsider the Developer\u2019s rezoning application in the light of the court\u2019s finding. The Board appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b416-10\">According to well-established principles of law, we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Developer, the prevailing party at trial. In 1983, Powhatan County enacted its zoning ordinance. Article 18, entitled \u201cCONDITIONAL ZONING,\u201d provides, in pertinent part, that a zoning applicant may request conditional zoning \u201cby voluntary proffer ... of reasonable conditions.\u201d Article 18 also provides that the rezoning must give rise to the need for the conditions and that the conditions must have a reasonable relation to the rezoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-11\">On June 30, 1993, the Developer sought the rezoning of approximately 233 acres of land from an agricultural (A-1) zoning <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>classification to a single-family residential (R-1) zoning classification. The Developer\u2019s rezoning application met all requirements of the County\u2019s zoning ordinance and for an R-1 classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-4\">At the public hearing on the rezoning application, conducted by the Powhatan County Planning Commission on August 3, 1993, no one appeared in opposition to the Developer\u2019s request. The planning staff recommended approval of the rezoning, and the planning commission later unanimously recommended its approval. On August 9, 1993, however, the Board adopted \u201cproffer guidelines\u201d which set forth a \u201crecommended\u201d proffer of $2,439 per lot \u201cto help defray costs of capital facilities related to new development.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">The Developer\u2019s rezoning application first came before the Board on September 13, 1993. At that time, the Developer proffered a cash payment \u201cunder protest,\u201d but the Board deferred the matter to its October 11, 1993 meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">At the October 11, 1993 Board meeting and public hearing on the Developer\u2019s rezoning application, no member of the public spoke in opposition to the rezoning request. It was apparent, however, that the Board would not approve the rezoning request unless the Developer agreed to pay $2,439 per lot, even though the Developer\u2019s counsel asserted that the cash proffer demand was illegal. The Developer refused to yield to the Board\u2019s demand, and the Board denied the rezoning request.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-7\">At trial, the County\u2019s Director of the Department of Planning and Community Development testified that a cash proffer of $2,439 per lot was \u201cexpected\u201d prior to the approval of residential rezoning. He also testified that, since the Board adopted the proffer guidelines in August 1993, virtually no R-1 rezonings had been approved without the cash proffer.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-8\">In his letter opinion, the trial judge recognized that Code \u00a7 15.1-491.2:1 enabled the Board to accept \u201cvoluntary\u201d proffers from applicants requesting a zoning change. He found, however, that \u201cthe sole reason for denial of [the Developer\u2019s] request was its failure or refusal to proffer $2439 per lot.\u201d The judge concluded, therefore, that \u201c[t]he County is clearly imposing an impact fee not authorized by statute and which it is without power to impose.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b418-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">Boards of supervisors, like other local governing bodies, have only those powers that the General Assembly, expressly or by necessary implication, confers upon them. <em>Board of Supervisors </em>v. <em>Horne, </em>216 Va. 113, 117, 215 S.E.2d 453, 455 (1975); <em>Gordon </em>v. <em>Fairfax County, </em>207 Va. 827, 832, 153 S.E.2d 270, 274 (1967); <em>Board of Supervisors </em>v. <em>Corbett, </em>206 Va. 167, 174, 142 S.E.2d 504, 509 (1965). If there is a reasonable doubt whether legislative power exists, the doubt must be resolved against the local governing body. <em>City of Richmond </em>v. <em>Confrere Club of Richmond, </em>239 Va. 77, 79-80, 387 S.E.2d 471, 473 (1990); <em>Winchester </em>v. <em>Redmond, </em>93 Va. 711, 714, 25 S.E. 1001, 1002 (1896). However, when an enabling statute is clear and unambiguous, its intent is determined from the plain meaning of the words used, and, in that event, neither rules of construction nor extrinsic evidence may be employed. <em>Confrere Club of Richmond, 239 </em>Va. at 80, 387 S.E.2d at 473; <em>Marsh </em>v. <em>City of Richmond, </em>234 Va. 4, 11, 360 S.E.2d 163, 167 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">A plain reading of Code \u00a7 15.1-491.2:1 in the light of the foregoing principles of law demonstrates that a county is not empowered to require a specified proffer as a condition precedent to a rezoning. The statute clearly states that proffers of conditions by a zoning applicant must be made <em>voluntarily.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b418-6\">In the present case, the trial court found that the sole reason the Board denied the rezoning request was the Developer\u2019s refusal to proffer $2,439 per lot, a finding fully supported by the evidence. Therefore, under the facts presented, the proffer constituted a condition precedent and was not voluntary within the meaning of the statute. Consequently, we hold, as did the trial court, that the Board imposed an unlawful condition on the Developer.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b419-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"401\">*401</page-number>IV</p>\n<p id=\"b419-5\">Accordingly, we will affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment and remand the case to the trial court with directions that it remand the matter to the Board for reconsideration of the Developer\u2019s rezoning application consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-6\">\n<em>Affirmed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b418-7\"> It is interesting to note that, since the enactment of Code \u00a7 15.1-491.2:1, the General Assembly has rejected all efforts to grant to localities greater power to charge landowners and developers with the capital costs associated with residential growth. <em>See, e.g., </em>S.B. 788, 1989 Sess. (no action taken); S.B. 340, 1992 Sess. (passed by Senate, but stricken from House docket by Committee on Counties, Cities and Towns in 1993); H.B. 1138, 1992 Sess. (passed by indefinitely by Committee on Counties, Cities and Towns); H.B. 2323, 1993 Sess. (passed by indefinitely by Committee on Counties, Cities and Towns).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
