The dis-positive issue is the admissibility of evidence of Barrett\u2019s intoxication discovered during a brief police stop to investigate whether Barrett\u2019s vehicle was malfunctioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-14\">State Trooper J.R. Lyons testified that while he was travelling west on Route 360 in Northumberland County at 9:20 p.m. on October 2, 1991, he noticed a pickup truck occupied by a driver and two passengers stopped in a yard off the east lane of the highway. After continuing west for about one-half mile, Lyons turned around and went back to investigate whether the pickup truck had broken down.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>Upon returning to the scene, Lyons observed the pickup truck moving with its wheels partially on the shoulder of the road and partially in the private yard, which \u201cseemed odd\u201d to Lyons since the driver could have \u201cpulled onto the roadway.\u201d As Lyons approached the rear of the pickup truck, he activated the cruiser\u2019s flashing lights to stop the pickup truck \u201conly to see whether there was a problem.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b263-4\">Both vehicles stopped. As Lyons walked up to the pickup truck, he smelled a strong odor of alcohol \u201con or about the person of Barrett,\u201d who was driving the pickup truck. Barrett admitted that he had been drinking. After Barrett performed three field sobriety tests \u201cvery poorly,\u201d and a roadside breathalizer test indicated that Barrett was intoxicated, Lyons arrested him on a DUI charge. Shortly thereafter, a blood test was administered to Barrett, which indicated that he had a blood alcohol content of 0.12% by weight by volume.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Later ascertaining that Barrett had two prior DUI convictions in the ten years preceding his arrest on this charge, the Commonwealth amended the arrest warrant to reflect that fact. Code \u00a7 18.2-270. Upon his conviction by the general district court, Barrett appealed to the circuit court.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">During his bench trial in the circuit court, Barrett moved to suppress Lyons\u2019s testimony since the trooper\u2019s investigative stop was not supported by \u201ca reasonable, articulable suspicion that a crime was occurring or [was] about to occur,\u201d and thus violated Barrett\u2019s Fourth Amendment right not to be subjected to unreasonable searches and seizures.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Overruling this motion and Barrett\u2019s subsequent motion to strike the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, the trial court reasoned that \u201cdue to the unusual situation which Lyons was confronted with[,] he was required to investigate [and that] it was natural for Lyons\u2019[s] curiosity to be aroused, since this was a situation that was not seen very often.\u201d Following Lyons\u2019s testimony, proof of Barrett\u2019s blood test and two prior DUI convictions, and testimony adduced by Barrett of his good character, the trial court convicted and sentenced Barrett.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-7\">Barrett appealed to the Court of Appeals. Concluding that Lyons\u2019s action in stopping Barrett was a seizure in violation of Barrett\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights, a panel of that court reversed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"246\">*246</page-number>the judgment of the trial court. <em>Barrett v. Commonwealth, </em>17 Va. App. 196, 435 S.E.2d 902 (1993). However, after a rehearing <em>en banc, </em>the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court\u2019s judgment. <em>Barrett </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>18 Va. App. 773, 447 S.E.2d 243 (1994). Barrett appeals to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-5\">The Commonwealth concedes that Lyons\u2019s stop and detention of Barrett was a \u201cseizure\u201d for Fourth Amendment purposes and that it was not based on an investigation of any crime, motor vehicle violation, or equipment violation. Hence, the admissibility of the evidence of Barrett\u2019s intoxication depends upon whether Lyons had the right to stop Barrett to investigate whether he was experiencing mechanical difficulties with his vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b264-6\">Barrett contends that this stop can be justified only if Lyons reasonably believed that Barrett was engaged in criminal activity at the time he was seized. On the other hand, the Commonwealth claims that Lyons had the right to make the stop in the exercise of the so-called \u201ccommunity caretaking functions\u201d doctrine articulated in the following language in <em>Cady </em>v. <em>Dombrowski, </em>413 U.S. 433 (1973):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b264-7\">Because of the extensive regulation of motor vehicles and traffic, and also because of the frequency with which a vehicle can become disabled or involved in an accident on public highways, the extent of police-citizen contact involving automobiles will be substantially greater than police-citizen contact in a home or office. Some such contacts will occur because the officer may believe the operator has violated a criminal statute, but many more will not be of that nature. Local police officers . . . frequently investigate vehicle accidents in which there is no claim of criminal liability and engage in what, for want of a better term, may be described as <em>community caretaking functions, </em>totally divorced from the detection, investigation, or acquisition of evidence relating to the violation of a criminal statute. . . . [Ojften [that] noncriminal contact with automobiles will bring . . . officials in \u201cplain view\u201d of evidence, fruits, or instrumentalities of a crime, or contraband.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b264-8\">413 U.S. at 441-42 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b264-9\">However, neither <em>Cady </em>nor the two subsequent Supreme Court cases applying the so-called \u201ccommunity caretaking func<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"247\">*247</page-number>tions\u201d doctrine involved investigative stops and \u201cseizures\u201d; they involved the admissibility of incriminating evidence discovered during a standard police procedure of inventorying property that had properly been taken into custody. <em>Cady, </em>413 U.S. at 443; <em>South Dakota </em>v. <em>Opperman, </em>428 U.S. 364, 375-76 (1976); <em>Colorado </em>v. <em>Bertine, </em>479 U.S. 367, 375-76 (1987). Here, the Commonwealth urges us to extend this doctrine to validate investigative stops and detention of persons not evidently engaged in criminal activity, but who apparently need some police assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-5\">Before we can decide whether this doctrine will be applied in Virginia, we must first consider whether the evidence in this case is sufficient to indicate that Barrett apparently needed police assistance. Lyons testified that he stopped Barrett \u201cto see whether there was a problem\u201d because it \u201cseemed odd\u201d that he would drive partially upon the shoulder of the road and partially on the adjoining yard and not enter the highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-6\"><em>Zimmerman </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>234 Va. 609, 363 S.E.2d 708 (1988), not cited by either party, is instructive. There, a police officer observed the defendant driving a vehicle very slowly on a military base. When the police officer \u201cpulled\u201d his vehicle \u201cup behind\u201d the defendant\u2019s vehicle, the defendant drove from the travelled portion of the street onto the grass and stopped. Her husband left the passenger\u2019s seat and asked for directions to a building on the base. After the police officer gave these directions, the husband returned to the vehicle, the defendant slid over to the passenger\u2019s seat, and the husband drove the vehicle beyond the point at which he should have turned had he followed the police officer\u2019s directions. The police officer then stopped the vehicle because he noticed that \u201cthey had switched operators and that attracted [his] attention.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 611, 363 S.E.2d at 709.</p>\n<p id=\"b265-7\">Even though these actions may have seemed unusual to the officer, we held the investigative stop unlawful, concluding that these actions were insufficient to justify a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. <em>Id. </em>at 612, 363 S.E.2d at 709. We also noted that the detention would have been justified if the police officer had \u201ca <em>reasonable suspicion, based on objective facts, </em>that the individual is involved in criminal activity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 611, 363 S.E.2d at 709 (quoting <em>Leeth v. Commonwealth, </em>223 Va. 335, 340, 288 S.E.2d 475, 478 (1982) (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p id=\"b265-8\">As previously indicated, the only justification offered for Barrett\u2019s \u201cseizure\u201d is Lyons\u2019s testimony that he stopped Barrett <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>merely \u201cto see whether there was a problem\u201d because it \u201cseemed odd\u201d that he would drive partially upon the shoulder of the road and partially on the adjoining yard and not enter the highway. Just as the actions in <em>Zimmerman </em>were insufficient to justify a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity, we conclude that Barrett\u2019s \u201codd\u201d conduct, without more, did not give rise to \u201ca reasonable suspicion, based on objective facts,\u201d that he needed police assistance. Thus, we need not decide whether the so-called \u201ccommunity caretaking functions\u201d doctrine will be applied in Virginia when the evidence is sufficient to show that the detained person required police assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">Accordingly, the Court of Appeals erred in affirming the trial court\u2019s judgment. The judgment of conviction will be vacated and the order appealed from will be reversed. And the warrant will be dismissed, since without the evidence acquired during Lyons\u2019s illegal stop, there was no evidence to support his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b263-8\"> The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides in pertinent part that \u201c[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
