The County Board of Arlington County (the County) approved a partial exemption for rehabilitation which reduced the assessed value to $24,539,900. In October, based upon a review of a three-year history of Sheffield Court\u2019s report of operating income and expense and a redetermination of its net operating income, the County raised the January assessment to $26,896,600.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-7\">In December 1993, Lee Gardens filed an application under Code \u00a7\u00a7 58.1-3984 and -3987 to correct the revised assessment and to require a refund of overpayment. Lee Gardens alleged that the 1992 assessment \u201cdoes not reflect the fair market value of the property [and] ... is not uniform in its application.\u201d The County filed a counterclaim asking the court to increase the assessment to $28,139,800 \u201cbased on actual net operating income . . . data . . . not received . . . until after the 1992 assessment was made.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b554-8\">During discovery, Lee Gardens requested disclosure of tax assessment worksheets used by the County, and the County filed a request for disclosure of certain taxpayer records. The trial court denied the taxpayer\u2019s request and, in part, the County\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-9\">As its final witness at trial, Lee Gardens introduced George Byrne, a private tax consultant, and asked the court to qualify him as an expert in valuation of commercial real estate and review of assessments. Byrne was not licensed as an appraiser, and the court ruled that he was ineligible to testify as an expert witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-10\">Lee Gardens moved for a continuance. The court denied the motion. The taxpayer moved for nonsuit, and the County moved to strike the taxpayer\u2019s evidence. The court denied Lee Gardens\u2019 motion and granted the County\u2019s motion to strike the evidence. Thereupon, the County nonsuited its counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-11\">We awarded Lee Gardens an appeal, and we will consider the three questions raised by its assignments of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"537\">*537</page-number>I</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">First, we address the question whether the trial court erred in denying the taxpayer\u2019s discovery request.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">The assessment formula employed here is called \u201ccapitalization of net operating income\u201d. Under that formula, operating expenses are subtracted from operating income, and a capitalization rate is applied to the difference to determine the assessment. As operating income remains constant, the quantum of the assessment will vary according to changes in the operating-expense factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-6\">In its application of the assessment formula, the County created a set of \u201cguidelines\u201d of income and expenses. The set includes different guidelines for different types of taxable properties. Thomas Rice, director of the County\u2019s department of assessments, testified that the guidelines were used as \u201cthe first indication on the value\u201d; that the appraisal staff \u201cexamines each of the indications of value produced by those guidelines . . . the experience of the property, its history as reported\u201d; that the staff \u201chas the latitude of adjusting those guideline numbers ... to reflect the operation of the particular property\u201d; and that, absent such \u201chistorical . . . information, the last resort for the county is to rely on the guidelines\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-7\">Rice said that the guidelines were not applied to Sheffield Court because its history of operation showed \u201chigher rent\u201d and \u201clower expenses\u201d than those \u201cindicated by the guidelines\u201d, and that no apartment complex with a history of income and expenses like those of Sheffield Court had been assessed by applying the guidelines. As appears from the County\u2019s response to a request for admissions, approximately 40 percent of 1992 appraisals of large garden apartment complexes did not apply the guidelines. Rice testified further that the guidelines were not applied when actual expenses were historically higher than the guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b555-8\">Lee Gardens argues on brief that use of actual expenses <em>lower </em>than guidelines \u201cresults in a . . . higher assessment\u201d and that \u201cthis method ... is not uniform in application.\u201d Lee Gardens also contends that the County\u2019s use of actual expenses <em>higher </em>than the guidelines \u201cis directly relevant to the non-uniformity basis of the taxpayer\u2019s claim.\u201d Consequently, Lee Gardens reasons, the trial court committed reversible error when it denied its discovery motion. That motion requested disclosure of County \u201ctax worksheets for all commercial properties whose expenses exceeded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"538\">*538</page-number>those for the guidelines, and whose actual, or stabilized, expenses were used to compute net operating income.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b556-4\">Under Code \u00a7 58.1-3, income and expense information taxpayers provide tax officials is confidential, and any disclosure made without a court order is a Class 2 misdemeanor. Rule 4:1(b)(1) authorizes a trial court to order discovery \u201cregarding any matter, not privileged, which is relevant to the subject matter involved\u201d, including any information \u201creasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.\u201d With respect to the recipient of a discovery order, Rule 4:1(c) empowers the court to \u201cmake any order which justice requires to protect a party or person from . . . undue burden or expense, including one . . . that . . . confidential . . . commercial information not be disclosed\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-5\">The record shows that the County assesses \u201capproximately 1000 parcels of real estate which are classified as apartment properties\u201d, including \u201csome 500 plus . . . apartment complexes\u201d with a total of \u201csome 40,000 apartment units in Arlington County\u201d. Lee Gardens\u2019 discovery request embraced not only apartment properties, but \u201ctax worksheets for all commercial properties\u201d in Arlington County.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">\u201cAll taxes . . . shall be uniform upon the same class of subjects\u201d. Va. Const. art. X, \u00a7 1. The constitutional mandate requires uniformity in the assessment of \u201cproperties having like characteristics and qualities, located in the same area.\u201d <em>Smith </em>v. <em>City of Covington, </em>205 Va. 104, 108, 135 S.E.2d 220, 223 (1964). Obviously, Lee Gardens\u2019 discovery request extends to a \u201cclass of subjects\u201d with \u201ccharacteristics and qualities\u201d <em>unlike </em>apartment complexes and whose histories of income and expense are <em>unlike </em>that experienced by Sheffield Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">The trial court\u2019s order denying Lee Garden\u2019s request was based upon the court\u2019s finding that the request was \u201coverbroad, burdensome and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence\u201d. Citing <em>Rakes </em>v. <em>Fulcher, </em>210 Va. 542, 546, 172 S.E.2d 751, 755 (1970), Lee Gardens acknowledges on brief that \u201c[t]he granting or denying of a request for discovery is a matter within the trial court\u2019s discretion and will be reversed only if the action taken was improvident, and affected substantial rights.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">We are of opinion that the trial court\u2019s finding is supported by the record and complies with the provisions of Rule 4:1. Consequently, we cannot say that the order denying Lee Gardens\u2019 dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>closure request was an abuse of the court\u2019s discretion, and we will affirm the order denying that request.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-3\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">Next, we consider whether a person unqualified to obtain an appraiser\u2019s license can testify as an expert witness on real estate valuation.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">On <em>voir dire, </em>Byrne acknowledged that he was a tax consultant under contract with Lee Gardens\u2019 attorney; that he was being compensated for his testimony; that he would testify as to the value of Sheffield Court; and that he did not have a Virginia real estate appraiser\u2019s license. Asked if he was \u201cqualified to get a license\u201d, Byrne replied, \u201cI don\u2019t have the course work.\u201d Sustaining the County\u2019s objection, the trial court ruled that Byrne \u201ccan\u2019t be qualified [as an expert witness] without a license.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">The question in issue is a matter of first impression in this Court. However, the Attorney General of Virginia has issued an opinion relevant to that issue. Op. Att\u2019y Gen. 211 (1993). Construing the applicable statutes in Chapter 20.1 of Title 54.1 of the Code, the Attorney General concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b557-7\">it is unlawful [under Code \u00a7 54.1-2011(A)] for anyone, including a licensed real estate broker, who does not have a real estate appraiser\u2019s license to testify for compensation about the value of real estate in any court proceeding, unless permitted under applicable statutory exceptions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b557-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 212.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-9\">That conclusion was based, the Attorney General explained, upon the \u201cclear language\u201d of \u00a7 54.1-2011(A) which provides that \u201cit shall be unlawful to engage in the appraisal of real estate . . . for compensation\u201d and upon the \u201cplain language\u201d of \u00a7 54.1-2009 under which, the Attorney General said, \u201can \u2018appraisal\u2019 includes any opinion or conclusion about the value of interest in real property. An appraisal report may be either oral or written. A broker\u2019s testimony in a . . . court proceeding, therefore, clearly falls within this definition of an \u2018appraisal\u2019.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b557-10\">Lee Gardens contends that the statutory exception defined in Code \u00a7 54.1-2010(3) \u201cclearly applies to Mr. Byrne.\u201d That subsection of the statute creates an exception for \u201c[a]ny person who, in the ordinary course of business, provides consulting services <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>... for a fee\u201d. Construing that language, the Attorney General decided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-4\">In ordinary usage, \u201cconsulting\u201d is defined as \u201cproviding professional or expert advice.\u201d Webster\u2019s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 282 (1990). It is not clear that this definition is broad enough to include paid testimony in court, which goes beyond mere advice to the property owner paying for the testimony. In view of the rule of strict construction that applies to exemptions from licensing statutes, therefore, it is my opinion that \u00a7 54.1-2010(3) does not except a real estate broker\u2019s testimony from the general prohibition in \u00a7 54.1-2011(A).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 213.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">In <em>City of Winchester v. American Woodmark Corporation, </em>250 Va. 451, 458, 464 S.E.2d 148, 153 (1995), we said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b558-7\">[W]e have repeatedly held that the General Assembly is presumed to have knowledge of the Attorney General\u2019s interpretation of statutes and the General Assembly\u2019s failure to make corrective amendments evinces legislative acquiescence in the Attorney General\u2019s interpretation. <em>Browning-Ferris, Inc. v. Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 157, 161-62, 300 S.E.2d 603, 605-06 (1983); <em>Richard L. Deal and Assoc. v. Commonwealth, </em>224 Va. 618, 622, 299 S.E.2d 346, 348 (1983); <em>Albemarle County v. Marshall, </em>215 Va. 756, 762, 214 S.E.2d 146, 150 (1975).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b558-8\">The Attorney General\u2019s statutory analysis of the Code Chapter entitled \u201cReal Estate Appraisers\u201d was published August 18, 1993. In 1994, the General Assembly amended Code \u00a7 8.01-401.1 entitled \u201cOpinion testimony by experts.\u201d Acts 1994, c. 328. Had the legislature intended to make \u201ccorrective amendments\u201d to Chapter 20.1 of Title 54.1 enacted in 1990, it could have done so. It did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-9\">We share the Attorney General\u2019s analysis of the applicable statutes, and we will affirm the trial court\u2019s ruling that Byrne was ineligible to testify as an expert witness.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>III</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">Finally, we must decide whether the trial court erred in denying Lee Garden\u2019s motion for nonsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-5\">\u201cA party shall not be allowed to nonsuit a cause of action, without the consent of the adverse party who has filed a counterclaim, . . . unless the counterclaim . . . can remain pending for independent adjudication by the court.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.01-380(C). Absent the County\u2019s consent, the dispositive question is whether the County\u2019s counterclaim seeking an increase in the assessment could have remained pending on the docket for independent adjudication after Lee Gardens\u2019 claim seeking a decrease in assessment had been nonsuited.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-6\">Subsection B of Code \u00a7 58.1-3984 affords the commissioner of revenue of a county or city the same right to initiate litigation of a tax assessment as that afforded a taxpayer by subsection A of that statute. Lee Gardens concedes on brief that, to increase an under assessment, \u201cthe county\u2019s only recourse ... is to petition the Circuit Court for an increase in the assessment, pursuant to sec. 58.1-3984(B)\u201d. The County did not pursue that course. Instead, it chose to assert an under-assessment claim in litigation initiated by the taxpayer\u2019s over-assessment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-7\">Fair market value was the ultimate issue common to both claims. The County\u2019s counterclaim could not remain pending on the docket for an adjudication <em>independent </em>of an adjudication of the taxpayer\u2019s nonsuited claim; an adjudication of one claim would be an adjudication of both. Accordingly, we will uphold the trial court\u2019s ruling that Lee Gardens was not entitled to nonsuit its claim without the County\u2019s consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-8\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">Finding no merit in Lee Gardens\u2019 assignments of error, we need not address the County\u2019s assignment of cross-error, and we will affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-10\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
