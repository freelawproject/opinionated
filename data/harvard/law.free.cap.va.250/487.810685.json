Graham was convicted by a jury of the capital murder of Rebecca W. Rosenbluth as part of the same act or transaction as the killing of Richard A. Rosenbluth, her husband. Code \u00a7 18.2-31(7). The jury fixed punishment for this offense at life imprisonment and a fine of $100,000. The trial court sentenced Graham in accordance with the jury\u2019s verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-12\">The evidence at trial showed that, on November 30, 1993, Chesterfield County police discovered the bodies of Richard and Rebecca Rosenbluth in their home. Richard Rosenbluth had been shot twice in the head, and Rebecca Rosenbluth had been shot three times in the head and once in the neck. All these gunshot wounds were lethal.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-13\">Both of Mr. Rosenbluth\u2019s gunshot wounds and two of Mrs. Rosenbluth\u2019s wounds were inflicted by a handgun linked to Graham\u2019s co-defendant, Mark Sheppard.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> About one week prior to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"489\">*489</page-number>these murders, Sheppard had accidentally shot his friend, Benji Vaughn, using the same handgun.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Mrs. Rosenbluth\u2019s other two wounds were inflicted by a .45 caliber handgun, which the police found in the apartment of Priscilla Booker, Graham\u2019s girlfriend, immediately after Graham had telephoned Booker from the jail instructing her to \u201cget rid of it.\u201d Booker testified that Graham had obtained the handgun in September 1993.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">Other circumstantial evidence linked Graham and Sheppard to the Rosenbluth murders. They were both seen in possession of the Rosenbluths\u2019 vehicles. Graham pawned several items of the Rosenbluths\u2019 jewelry, and the police found Mrs. Rosenbluth\u2019s comb and brush set in Priscilla Booker\u2019s apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">At the time of his arrest, Sheppard had in his possession Mrs. Rosenbluth\u2019s watch and one of Mr. Rosenbluth\u2019s company credit cards. When the police searched Sheppard\u2019s place of residence, they discovered the Rosenbluths\u2019 stereo equipment, a piece of their luggage, and the license plates to one of their vehicles. In addition, Sheppard\u2019s fingerprint was identified on a package of razor blades found in the Rosenbluths\u2019 home.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">The evidence also showed that Graham and Sheppard were involved in the business of selling cocaine, and Graham admitted to the police that he had made several sales of cocaine to Mr. Rosenbluth. On occasion, Mr. Rosenbluth used credit cards to obtain hotel rooms for Graham and received cocaine from him in exchange. Graham told Priscilla Booker that Mr. Rosenbluth owed him money.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-9\">The Rosenbluths both had ingested cocaine shortly before they died. Traces of cocaine were found in their kitchen and den. Based on the above evidence, the prosecution argued that Graham and Sheppard killed the Rosenbluths and stole their property to \u201csettle\u201d existing drug debts.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-10\">On appeal, Graham first argues that the trial court erred in granting the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to exclude prospective juror James Summers for cause. He contends that the record shows that Summers did not have a fixed view against imposition of the death penalty. Graham asserts that, in striking a juror who had only \u201ca general hesitancy\u201d about his ability to consider the death penalty, the trial court caused \u201cthe prejudicial effect of impaneling a jury more prone to impose the death penalty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"490\">*490</page-number>In response, the Commonwealth argues that this claim is moot because the jury did not impose the death penalty, but fixed Graham\u2019s punishment at life imprisonment. We agree with the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">In <em>Witherspoon </em>v. <em>Illinois, </em>391 U.S. 510 (1968), the Supreme Court held that a sentence of death cannot be upheld if the jury that imposed or recommended the sentence was chosen by excluding members of the venire solely because they expressed <em>general </em>objections to capital punishment. <em>See id. </em>at 522. The rationale underlying this rule is that any such exclusions of potential jurors results in a jury that is \u201cdeath prone.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 520-21. However, prospective jurors may be excused for cause if they state that they could never vote to impose the death penalty, or that they would refuse even to consider its imposition in the case before the court. <em>Id. </em>at 522 n.21; <em>Morgan v. Illinois, </em>504 U.S. 719, 728 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">This <em>Witherspoon </em>inquiry is relevant, however, only when a sentence of death has been imposed. As this Court explained in <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 31, 35, 235 S.E.2d 320, 323 (1977), \u201ca <em>Witherspoon </em>error affects only the <em>sentence </em>of death and not the <em>conviction </em>for which the penalty is imposed.\u201d <em>See also Bumper </em>v. <em>North Carolina, </em>391 U.S. 543, 545 (1968). Thus, the <em>Witherspoon </em>error alleged here, that the trial court erred in excluding prospective juror Summers for cause because he expressed a \u201cgeneral hesitancy\u201d about his ability to consider the death penalty, is rendered moot by Graham\u2019s sentence of life imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">We next consider Graham\u2019s argument that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that it could find him guilty of capital murder if it found that he was the immediate perpetrator with respect to one killing, but only an accomplice in the other killing. Graham asserts that the Commonwealth was required to prove that he was the immediate perpetrator, the triggerman, in both killings. In support of this argument, Graham relies on <em>Frye v. Commonwealth, </em>231 Va. 370, 388, 345 S.E.2d 267, 280 (1986), in which this Court held that, except in the case of murder for hire, only the immediate perpetrator of a homicide may be convicted of capital murder. We disagree with the conclusion advanced by Graham.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">We first note that Graham does not dispute that the evidence is sufficient to establish he was an accomplice in the murder of Richard Rosenbluth. Instead, Graham bases his argument on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"491\">*491</page-number>fact there is no evidence that he was the triggerman in that murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">In <em>Fitzgerald </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>223 Va. 615, 292 S.E.2d 798 (1982), <em>cert. </em>denied, 459 U.S. 1228 (1983), this Court explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-6\">Code \u00a7 18.2-31, defining capital murder, was first enacted by the General Assembly in 1975 as part of a statutory scheme enacted to eliminate the \u201cunbridled choice between the death penalty and a lesser sentence\u201d prohibited by <em>Furman </em>v. <em>Georgia, </em>408 U.S. 238 (1972).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-7\">Subsequent amendments to the murder statutes, including those enacted in response to <em>Furman </em>in 1975, have changed the substance and the procedure of the statutes, but not their evident purpose. That purpose is gradation. The General Assembly grades murder in order to assign punishment consistent with prevailing societal and legal views of what is appropriate and procedurally fair.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 635-36, 292 S.E.2d at 810.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-9\">The language of Code \u00a7 18.2-31(7) evidences a legislative determination that the described offense is qualitatively more egregious than an isolated act of premeditated murder. This result is accomplished by the addition of a gradation crime to the single act of premeditated murder. Under this subsection, the gradation crime is the defendant\u2019s killing of more than one person as part of the same act or transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-10\">Although this Court has not addressed the precise issue that Graham raises, we have examined a related issue under Code \u00a7 18.2-31(4) and (5), in which the gradation crimes were robbery and rape. In <em>James Dyral Briley v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 563, 273 S.E.2d 57 (1980), the defendant argued that, to be convicted of capital murder during the commission of a robbery or a rape, the prosecution was required to prove that he was a principal in the first degree to the gradation crimes. We disagreed, holding that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-11\">[Code] \u00a7 18.2-31 does not require proof that a defendant charged with murder during the commission of a robbery or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>a rape was a principal in the first degree to the crimes of robbery or rape. It is only necessary that the Commonwealth prove that the defendant was the triggerman in the murder and an accomplice in the robbery or rape to convict him of capital murder.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 573, 273 S.E.2d at 63; <em>see also Watkins </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>229 Va. 469, 485-86, 331 S.E.2d 422, 434-35 (1985), <em>cert. denied, </em>475 U.S. 1099 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">We conclude that this holding is dispositive of the issue before us, and that Code \u00a7 18.2-31(7) does not require proof that a defendant charged with capital murder, in the premeditated killing of more than one person as part of the same act or transaction, was the triggerman in each murder referenced in the indictment. Rather, this section requires proof only that the defendant was the triggerman in the principal murder charged, and that he was at least an accomplice in the murder of an additional person or persons as part of the same act or transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-7\">As stated above, Graham does not dispute that the evidence is sufficient to establish he was an accomplice in the murder of Richard Rosenbluth. Further, he does not dispute that the evidence is sufficient to establish that he was the triggerman in the willful, deliberate, and premeditated killing of Rebecca Rosenbluth. Therefore, we conclude that the trial court did not err in its instructions to the jury on the offense charged under Code \u00a7 18.2-31(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b510-8\">For these reasons, we will affirm the trial court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b506-14\"> Sheppard\u2019s convictions arising from these events are reviewed by this Court in <em>Sheppard </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>250 Va. 379, 464 S.E.2d 131 (1995), decided today.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
