He received a sentence of life imprisonment for each murder conviction and 10 years\u2019 imprisonment and a fine of $15,000 for the arson conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-17\">On appeal to the Court of Appeals, Midkiff challenged the admissibility of a confession he made during a police interrogation. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>Midkiff contended that during the course of the questioning, he effectively invoked his constitutional right to counsel and his right to remain silent and that the exercise of these rights was not honored by his interrogators. Additionally, Midkiff maintained that, considering the totality of the circumstances, his confession was involuntary.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">The Court of Appeals denied MidkifFs petition for appeal, concluding that under the totality of the circumstances Midkiff voluntarily answered questions from the officers and that his statement, \u201cI\u2019m scared to say anything without talking to a lawyer,\u201d was not a clear and unambiguous invocation of either his right to counsel or his right to remain silent. We granted MidkifFs petition for appeal on these same issues and will affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">At 8:00 p.m. on December 3, 1991, the Hillsville Volunteer Fire Department was dispatched to the scene of a fire at a Carroll County residence. Inside, fire fighters found the bodies of Sheila Marie Ring and her two-year-old daughter, Jasmine Sutphin. Although the bodies were badly burned, subsequent autopsies revealed that both victims died from wounds inflicted prior to the fire. The cause of Ring\u2019s death was determined to be multiple stab wounds. Sutphin died from a single cut to her throat.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">During the course of the investigation, Ring\u2019s landlord, Rhudy Lineberry, told investigators that he had seen a man on the porch of Ring\u2019s residence around 5:30 p.m. on the evening of the fire. Lineberry later identified this man as Midkiff. After being informed by his brother-in-law that he was a suspect, Midkiff voluntarily went to the sheriff\u2019s office for questioning on December 5, 1991, at 10:40 p.m. Midkiff was read his <em>Miranda </em>rights before being questioned. After approximately 20 minutes of questioning, Midkiff agreed to go to the state police headquarters in Wytheville for a polygraph examination and further interrogation. Although he initially denied any involvement with the murders and the arson, during the course of questioning at Wytheville Midkiff orally confessed to both murders and signed two written confessions. He was given his <em>Miranda </em>rights twice more at Wytheville, once prior to taking three polygraph examinations and again before signing the written confessions.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>III.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\">Midkiff relies on two exchanges during the course of his interrogation in Wytheville to sustain his contention that he invoked his constitutional rights. During post-polygraph questioning by State Police Special Agent T.S. Svard, the following conversation transpired:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-6\">MR. SVARD: This is the only job I\u2019ve had in twenty-three (23) years where I can actually help people. You can\u2019t help them in uniform. You can\u2019t help them out there. Here, I can help them, help them. So I want you to tell me what happened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-7\">MR. MIDKIFF: I\u2019ll be honest with you, I\u2019m scared to say anything without talking to a lawyer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-8\">MR. SVARD: Well, that\u2019s entirely up to you, but, but . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-9\">MR. MIDKIFF: Because I, I got hoodooed big time back in, when I was in, now, don\u2019t get me wrong, I ain\u2019t . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-10\">(recorder is turned off)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-11\">After the recorder was turned back on, Sheriff Carrico began questioning Midkiff.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-12\">SHERIFF CARRICO: Let\u2019s talk about it. Be up front with me. I\u2019ll be up front with you. I\u2019ll get you every bit of help I can. Was you over there? Talk to me, T.J.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-13\">MR. MIDKIFF: I don\u2019t got to answer that, Dick, you know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-14\">SHERIFF CARRICO: No. You\u2019ve got to tell me. I can\u2019t just up and say T.J., I got to, I got to listen to you. You\u2019ve got to tell me and the only way that I can get you help is for you to tell me.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-15\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-16\">Midkiff relies on the statement, \u201cI\u2019ll be honest with you, I\u2019m scared to say anything without talking to a lawyer,\u201d to support the contention that his confession should be suppressed because he invoked his right to counsel. Since the United States Su<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>preme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 474 (1966), courts have recognized that the assertion of the right to counsel is a significant event and that thereafter all questioning must be suspended until an attorney is present. In the years since <em>Miranda, </em>it has become well established that once an accused expresses a desire to exercise his right to counsel, authorities may not further interrogate the accused until counsel is present unless the accused initiates further conversation or exchanges with the authorities. <em>Edwards v. Arizona, </em>451 U.S. 477, 484-85 (1981). <em>Miranda </em>and its progeny do not permit the police to continue to interrogate an accused in custody if he has \u201cclearly asserted his right to counsel.\u201d <em>Edwards, </em>451 U.S. at 485.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">This Court has consistently held that a clear and unambiguous assertion of the right to counsel is necessary to invoke the <em>Edwards </em>rule. <em>See Mueller </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>244 Va. 386, 422 S.E.2d 380 (1992), <em>cert. denied, </em>507 U.S. 1043 (1993); <em>King v. Commonwealth, </em>243 Va. 353, 416 S.E.2d 669, <em>cert. denied, </em>506 U.S. 957 (1992); <em>Eaton v. Commonwealth, </em>240 Va. 236, 397 S.E.2d 385 (1990), <em>cert. denied, </em>502 U.S. 824 (1991). Recently, the United States Supreme Court, while recognizing that good practice suggests that the police should attempt to clarify ambiguous statements, nevertheless held that, after a voluntary and knowing waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights, officers may continue questioning until the suspect clearly and unequivocally requests an attorney. <em>Davis v. United States, </em>_ U.S. -, -, 114 S.Ct. 2350, 2356-57 (1994). Therefore, the issue is whether the statement, \u201cI\u2019ll be honest with you, I\u2019m scared to say anything without talking to a lawyer,\u201d was a clear and unambiguous assertion by Midkiff of his right to counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">In prior decisions, we have been faced with the task of evaluating statements similar to the one that Midkiff asserts is a clear invocation of his right to counsel. We have held that defendants\u2019 questions, \u201cDo you think I need an attorney here?,\u201d <em>Mueller, </em>244 Va. at 396, 422 S.E.2d at 387, \u201cYou did say I could have an attorney if I wanted one?,\u201d <em>Eaton, </em>240 Va. at 250, 397 S.E.2d at 393, and \u201cDidn\u2019t you say I have the right to an attorney?,\u201d <em>Poyner </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>229 Va. 401, 410, 329 S.E.2d 815, 823, <em>cert. denied, </em>474 U.S. 865 (1985), fell short of being clear assertions of the right to counsel. Further, the United States Supreme Court recently held that the statement, \u201cMaybe I should talk to a lawyer,\u201d was not an invocation of the right to counsel <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>and, therefore, subsequent statements by the accused did not need to be suppressed. Davis,_U.S. at_, 114 S.Ct. at 2357.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">Midkiffs statement falls within the category of statements which do not clearly and unambiguously request an attorney. The statement, \u201cI\u2019m scared to say anything without talking to a lawyer,\u201d expresses his reservation about the wisdom of continuing the interrogation without consulting a lawyer; however, it does not clearly and unambiguously communicate a desire to invoke his right to counsel. Midkiffs statement, similar to those of the defendants in <em>Mueller, Eaton, </em>and <em>Poyner, </em>fell short of requesting counsel in a clear and unambiguous manner.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">Similar considerations are raised by Midkiffs argument concerning his right to remain silent. Relying on the statements, \u201cI\u2019ll be honest with you, I\u2019m scared to say anything without talking to a lawyer\u201d and \u201cI don\u2019t got to answer that, Dick, you know,\u201d Midkiff maintains that he invoked his right to remain silent. <em>Miranda </em>recognized that if a suspect \u201cindicates in any manner, at any time prior to or during questioning, that he wishes to remain silent, the interrogation must cease.\u201d <em>Miranda, </em>384 U.S. at 473-74. However, this Court has stated that <em>\u201cMiranda </em>should not be read so strictly as to require the police to accept as conclusive any statement, no matter how ambiguous, as a sign that the suspect desires to cut off questioning.\u201d <em>Lamb </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 307, 312, 227 S.E.2d 737, 741 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">Considering Midkiffs statements in context, it is clear that both are statements expressing reservations about discussing the case but do not invoke his right to remain silent. The transcript of the interrogation session excerpted above shows that Midkiff was interrupted by Agent Svard. When Midkiffs statement is examined without Svard\u2019s interjection, \u201cI\u2019ll be honest with you, I\u2019m scared to say anything without talking to a lawyer . . . [b]ecause I, I got hoodooed big time back in, when I was in, now, don\u2019t get me wrong . . .,\u201d it is clear that Midkiff merely expressed his reservations about answering questions based on his past experience with the criminal justice system. As we noted recently, \u201c[i]t is true that [the defendant\u2019s] statements can be perceived as a reservation about the wisdom of continuing the interrogation. However, in spite of whatever reservations he may have had, he elected to proceed with the interrogation and failed to exercise his right to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>terminate questioning.\u201d <em>Burket </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>248 Va. 596, 610, 450 S.E.2d 124, 132 (1994), <em>cert. </em>denied, ___ U.S. ___, 115 S.Ct. 1433 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">Similarly, the second statement, \u201cI don\u2019t got to answer that, Dick, you know,\u201d is simply an affirmation that Midkiff understood his right to remain silent. Nothing within that statement connotes a desire to cease all questioning. Here again, we decline to read <em>Miranda </em>so narrowly as to compel police interrogators to accept any statement, no matter how equivocal, as an invocation of the right to remain silent. As we noted in <em>Akers </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 40, 46, 216 S.E.2d 28, 32 (1975), had Midkiff wished to terminate the questioning he could have simply said \u201cI do not want to answer any more questions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">Midkiff s last contention is that his confession was involuntary. The standard of review for determining whether a defendant\u2019s confession was voluntary is well established.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b286-10\">\u201cWhether a statement is voluntary is ultimately a legal rather than factual question. <em>See Miller </em>v. <em>Fenton, </em>474 U.S. 104, 110, 106 S.Ct. 445, 450 (1985). Subsidiary factual questions, however, are entitled to a presumption of correctness. <em>Id. </em>at 112, 106 S.Ct. at 451. The test to be applied in determining voluntariness is whether the statement is the \u2018product of an essentially free and unconstrained choice by its maker,\u2019 or whether the maker\u2019s will \u2018has been overborne and his capacity for self-determination critically impaired.\u2019 <em>Schneckloth </em>v. <em>Bustamonte, </em>412 U.S. 218, 225 (1973). In determining whether a defendant\u2019s will has been overborne, courts look to \u2018the totality of all the surrounding circumstances,\u2019 <em>id. </em>at 226, including the defendant\u2019s background and experience and the conduct of the police, <em>Correll </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>232 Va. 454, 464, 352 S.E.2d 352, 357 (1987); <em>Stockton, </em>227 Va. at 140, 314 S.E.2d at 381.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b286-11\"><em>Burket </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>248 Va. at 611, 450 S.E.2d at 132 (citations omitted). If the suspect\u2019s \u201cwill has been overborne and his capacity for self-determination critically impaired,\u201d the confession is considered involuntary and its use is unconstitutional. <em>Schneckloth </em>v. <em>Bustamonte, </em>412 U.S. 218, 225 (1973). Voluntan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>ness is a question of law, subject to independent appellate review. <em>Harrison </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>244 Va. 576, 581, 423 S.E.2d 160, 163 (1992). The test of voluntariness is whether, considering the totality of the circumstances, the confession was \u201cthe product of an essentially free and unconstrained choice by its maker.\u201d <em>Schneckloth, </em>412 U.S. at 225. In assessing the surrounding circumstances, courts will consider the defendant\u2019s background and the details of the interrogation. <em>Gray </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>233 Va. 313, 324, 356 S.E.2d 157, 163, <em>cert. denied, </em>484 U.S. 873 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\">The record in this case indicates that MidkifFs will was not overborne and his capacity for self-determination was not impaired. Although Midkiff and Sheriff Carrico were friends, there is no evidence that Sheriff Carrico used any undue influence to get Midkiff to discuss the crimes during interrogation. Sheriff Carrico\u2019s offer to get Midkiff \u201chelp\u201d if he talked to him about the murders cannot be considered coercion or inducement. MidkifFs confession was not any less a \u201cfree and unconstrained choice\u201d by virtue of this friendship. Furthermore, Midkiff is no stranger to the criminal justice system. Prior to the contested charges, Midkiff had been convicted of five felonies, starting at the age of eighteen. He was 27 years old at the time of the murders in this case. It is apparent that Midkiff has experienced several prior police interrogations.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">Additionally, while the interrogation process lasted well into the early morning hours of December 6, 1991, and took place at a location approximately 40 miles from MidkifFs home, these factors are not sufficient to establish that his will was overborne. All police interviews of suspects have coercive aspects to them by virtue of the fact that the interrogating officer is part of a system which may ultimately charge the suspect with a crime. <em>Oregon </em>v. <em>Mathiason, </em>429 U.S. 492, 495 (1977). With regard to the investigation in this case, Midkiff voluntarily went to the sheriff\u2019s office for questioning after learning from his brother-in-law that Sheriff Carrico wanted to talk to him. In fact, when he was initially given his <em>Miranda </em>rights at the sheriff\u2019s office, Sheriff Carrico testified that Midkiff said something to the effect that \u201che didn\u2019t need to know them, that he already knew them.\u201d Later, Midkiff willingly went to the state police station to submit to polygraph examinations and was again given his <em>Miranda </em>rights before the polygraphs and before signing two written confessions. In MidkifFs second statement, he acknowledged that he \u201cfreely\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"270\">*270</page-number>waived his rights. The evidence demonstrates that Midkiff voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights and agreed to submit to questioning. Viewing the totality of the circumstances, the evidence simply does not suggest any other conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">V.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">In conclusion, we find no reversible error in the judgment of the Court of Appeals. Midkiff did not clearly and unambiguously invoke his constitutional right to counsel or his right to remain silent. Under the totality of the circumstances, his confession was voluntary. Therefore, for the reasons set forth, we will affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
