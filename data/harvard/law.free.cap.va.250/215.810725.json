Under the Virginia Real Estate Cooperative Act, Code \u00a7\u00a7 55-424 through -506, a \u201ccooperative\u201d is \u201creal estate owned by an association, each of the members of which is entitled, by virtue of his ownership interest in the association, to exclusive possession of a unit.\u201d Code \u00a7 55-426. A \u201ccooperative interest\u201d is \u201can ownership interest in the association coupled with a possessory interest in a unit under a proprietary lease.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A \u201cproprietary lease\u201d is \u201can agreement with the association pursuant to which a proprietary lessee has a possessory interest in a unit.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b234-11\">The sole question in this appeal is whether the trial court correctly ruled that a cooperative housing association was not permitted to obtain a personal money judgment against a purchaser at foreclosure for assessments of cooperative fees unpaid by the owners of proprietary leases, which were the subject of the foreclosure.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-12\">The facts are undisputed. Appellant River Place North Housing Corporation, the plaintiff below, is the cooperative association for the River Place North housing cooperative, situated in Arlington County. Abbas Ghassemi and Shawna L. Butler were the proprietary lessees of two River Place North cooperative units.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>In 1991, Ghassemi and Butler were delinquent in their mortgage and cooperative fee payments. The cooperative fees arose from assessments made upon the proprietary lessees to pay, <em>inter alia, </em>expenses of the common elements of the cooperative. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 55-471. The mortgage lender, Monument Associates, foreclosed its first deeds of trust on the units. Appellee American Landmark Equity Corporation, the defendant below, purchased the properties at foreclosure for $120,000 each in April 1991, and received trustee\u2019s deeds of assignment of proprietary leases. Each \u201cMemorandum of Sale\u201d described the \u201cproperty\u201d as the proprietary lease to the unit together with the lessee\u2019s shares of the capital stock of the plaintiff corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">In May 1993, the plaintiff filed the present action against the defendant seeking a judgment to recover assessments on the two units in the sums of $6,289 and $5,963.03 respectively, which represented the delinquencies at the time defendant became the proprietary lessee of the units. After completion of the plaintiffs evidence during a bench trial, the trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion to strike the plaintiffs evidence, ruling \u201cthat there is no personal liability of the Defendant for the debt claimed by the Plaintiff.\u201d The court did not address a statute of frauds defense raised by defendant. We awarded the plaintiff an appeal from the trial court\u2019s August 1994 order entering judgment for the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">On appeal, plaintiff contends the trial court erred in ruling that it could not obtain a personal money judgment against the defendant for the former proprietary lessees\u2019 unpaid assessments. The plaintiff says the \u201cfoundation\u201d of its motion for judgment is Section 7.3 of its bylaws. The section provides that the \u201cnew Proprietary Lessee of an Apartment shall be jointly and severally liable with the former Proprietary Lessee thereof for all unpaid assessments against that Proprietary Lessee or his shares which became due before the new Proprietary Lessee acquired ownership thereof.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">Plaintiff also relies on Sections 12.1 and 12.2 of the bylaws. The latter section provides that every assessment becomes a lien against the lessee\u2019s shares, \u201ceffective as of the date such assessment is made.\u201d The section also provides that the lien \u201cshall be prior to all liens and encumbrances recorded after the effective date thereof except for any Mortgage,\u201d defined in the relevant documents as a first deed of trust on a proprietary lease. The for<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>mer section, in subsections (c) and (f), provides that the remedies set forth in the bylaws are cumulative and are not subject to preclusion by election of remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">Plaintiff argues the trial court \u201cconcluded that the back assessments operated as liens on the property but did not create a cause of action for a money judgment\u201d against defendant. Plaintiff contends the trial court erroneously ruled that its sole cause of action is one to enforce the liens, not one for a personal money judgment, and that this ruling deprives it of the cumulative remedies afforded by the bylaws and the Virginia Real Estate Cooperative Act (the Act). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">The applicable provisions of the bylaws and the Act simply do not address foreclosure by a mortgage lender, and the liability of the foreclosure purchaser for assessments unpaid by the former owners of the proprietary leases foreclosed upon. Foreclosure is not mentioned in bylaw Section 7.3 entitled <em>\u201cLiability for Assess</em>ments,\u201d the \u201cfoundation\u201d of plaintiffs claim; in plain language, the section contemplates only a transfer of a proprietary lease by a means other than foreclosure by a mortgage lender. Bylaw Section 12.1 mentions foreclosure in subsection (f) labelled <em>'\u2018\u2018\u2018Legal </em>Proceedings,\u201d but speaks only to foreclosure of the lien for assessments. Bylaw Section 12.2 entitled <em>\u201cLien for </em>Assessments,\u201d does not mention foreclosure by a mortgage lender.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-6\">Code \u00a7 55-472 of the Act, relied upon by the plaintiff, deals with remedies for nonpayment of assessments. But the statute does not address foreclosure by a mortgage lender, and recovery of unpaid assessments through a personal judgment against the foreclosure purchaser.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">Moreover, the evidence fails to establish that the defendant agreed to be liable personally for unpaid assessments of the prior lessees. Each \u201cMemorandum of Sale,\u201d over a space for a \u201cPurchaser\u201d to sign, provides: \u201cI further acknowledge that this purchase is subject to the terms and conditions of the attached Notice of Trustee\u2019s Sale and the attached Announcements.\u201d But neither memorandum is signed by an individual purporting to represent defendant; handwritten on the \u201cPurchaser\u201d line merely is \u201cAmerican Landmark Equity Corp.\u201d Thus, even if plaintiff is correct that somehow the \u201csubject to\u201d language in the memoranda would impose personal liability upon a foreclosure purchaser who signed them, there is no evidence in the record that a person au<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>thorized to bind defendant signed either memorandum promising or agreeing to pay the debt.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">Finally, plaintiff relies upon <em>In re Rosenfeld, </em>23 F.3d 833 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. </em>denied, _U.S._, 115 S.Ct. 200 (1994), a case applying the Act but a case that is inapposite. There the issue was \u201cwhether a discharge in bankruptcy relieves a debtor from personal liability for post-petition assessments of cooperative housing dues.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 835. Unlike the present litigation, that case involved a cooperative\u2019s efforts to recover delinquent assessments directly from the owner who incurred the debt, not from a subsequent foreclosure purchaser.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">Consequently, we hold that the trial court correctly ruled the plaintiff was not entitled to a personal money judgment for the delinquent assessments in issue against the defendant under these circumstances. Thus, the judgment in favor of the defendant will be</p>\n<p id=\"b237-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
