If this were so, it would be a matter for complaint by petitioners and not by the Commission; but we do not think that the order of remand will have that effect. The right of review has been preserved by the petition filed and is not lost by the remand, the effect of which is to remit the whole matter to the Commission so that it may make any changes in the order that may be proper when passing upon the tariffs filed September 7, 1951. The orders entered at that time will determine whether or not the petitioners are aggrieved by the order entered April 25, 1952 and a petition to review such orders will present the questions raised by the present petition if they are then pertinent as well as other questions which may have arisen in the meantime. That there may be no question as to this, however, we have retained jurisdiction over the case and over these questions by the leave granted in the order of remand. The Commission suggests that we are without power to direct it to pass upon the tariffs filed September 7, 1951; but we unquestionably have such power as incident to our right to review its action on those tariffs as well as to review its order of April 25, 1952. See American Chain &amp; Cable Co. v. Federal Trade Commission, 4 Cir., 142 F.2d 909.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-11\">The Commission says that the questions presented by the petition for review are of great public importance. This is true of many moot cases, but it furnishes no reason why courts should review them. This court will encourage no such piecemeal hearing of controversies as would result from reviewing the order of April 25, 1952 in advance of the Commission\u2019s passing upon the tariffs filed September 7, 1951, since it is manifest that that order can have no practical effect and will aggrieve no one until order is entered dealing with the tariffs filed September 7, 1951, and that the latter order may remove all ground of controversy from the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-12\">The petition for rehearing will be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-13\">Rehearing denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
