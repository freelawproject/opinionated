The present petition by the Board is for enforcement of this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-12\">Though the respondents filed elaborate Exceptions to the Trial Examiner\u2019s Intermediate Report, which exceptions the Board overruled in its Decision and Order, respondents offered no- defense in this court to the pending enforcement petition either by way of brief or oral argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-13\">Upon consideration of the whole record in the case, we are satisfied that the Board\u2019s jurisdiction has been adequately established, and that the Board\u2019s findings of fact, upon which the order was predicated, were supported by substantial evidence. The terms of the remedial order were appropriate and within the discretion confided to the administrative agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-15\">A decree will be entered enforcing the order of the Board.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
