The.widow, who admittedly' kill<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>\u2022ed the insured, had been charged with murder and had been acquitted in the state court on a plea of self defense. The judge below properly held that the action of the state court in the criminal case was not binding in this case and upon the evidence submitted to him held that the killing was not justified on the theory of self defense but that the widow was guilty of the intentional and felonious slaying of the insured. We think that this was clearly right and that nothing need be added to what was said in the opinion below. See United States v. Burns, 103 F.Supp. 690.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
