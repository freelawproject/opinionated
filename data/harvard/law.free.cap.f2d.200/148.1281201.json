We are in no doubt that this remark whether merely impetuous and impromptu, or springing from surly and deep-seated resentment, was what fanned the smoldering fuse of resentment in John<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>son\u2019s mind against both Duncan and the Union into the flash of the explosion which resulted in Duncan\u2019s discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">We think this appears as the <em>res gestae </em>of the occurrence and the subsequent happenings. But if not, the evasion and equivocation and the belatedness wl_.ch attended giving the reason for the discharge would furnish ample additional support for the finding.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">To the findings made in support of the cease and desist provision of the order, the petitioner\u2019s defenses seem to be based upon its over all record, as an institution, of fairness and impartiality in dealing with organized labor, its attitude of non-interference with its employees, and its expression of policy in. respect to its employees joining or not joining a union.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">This, however, was not the issue presented for the consideration of the board. It is not the touchstone by which we are to \u00bfolve the question presented for our determination here. That question is, giving full consideration to petitioner\u2019s expression of policy and its attitude in general, and viewing the record as a whole, does the evidence, as to things said and done by responsible representatives of petitioner in connection with the events the record discloses, furnish a sufficient basis for the findings and conclusions of the examiner and board, that there was interference.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">We think it does.</p>\n<p id=\"A80\">In saying so, we are not unmindful of the complained of rulings of the examiner, with which we do not agree, that a question whether the witness knew that it was the position of Mr. Hotchkiss and the company that the employees could join or not join the union, was a conclusion and could not be testified to. It is not disputed, however, that the same matter came in later by another, witness and that the policy of the company to that effect was conveyed to all the employees in writing.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">The issue, therefore, comes down to this, whether the record affords a reasonable basis for the finding that, notwithstanding the general declarations of purpose' and policy,- on which petitioner relies, there was, under the evidence in this case, at this place and at this time, interference in contravention of the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-11\">We think: that the finding that there was is well supported iby the evidence; that the petition to set aside the order should be denied; and that the order should be enforced as written.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b197-10\">. In substance these were: (1) that statements by the employer were coercive and restraining as to union organization and activities; and (2) that Nolan W. Duncan was discriminatorily discharged.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b197-11\">. In substance this required the respondent: (1) to cease and desist from discouraging membership in Oil Workers International Union or any other labor organization, or in any manner interfering with their employees; and (2) to reinstate and make whole Nolan W. Duncan. 98 N.D.R.B.No.190.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b197-18\">. N. L. R. B. v. Fulton Bag &amp; Cotton Mills, 5 Cir., 175 F.2d 675; 29 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 160 (c); N. D. R. B. v.
