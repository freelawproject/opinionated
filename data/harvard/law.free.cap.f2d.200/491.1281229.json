Defendant admitted all the non-perjury statements. As to the perjury statement, he denied and, in the alternative, pleaded truth as a defense. The evidence showed that the \u201ctraitor\u201d charge meant that plaintiff was a \u201ctraitor\u201d to defendant and his band.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-6\">There was conflicting testimony as to the charge of perjury. The trial judge told the jury that the \u201cdefendant in pleading truth in a slander action is not repeating the slander.\u201d The judge left to the jury the questions whether defendant had accused plaintiff of perjury and whether defendant had established the defense of truth. At the close of the judge\u2019s instructions to the jury, he asked whether there were objections. Plaintiff\u2019s counsel replied: \u201cNo, your Honor has covered everything.\u201d Plaintiff now contends the judge erred, especially in leaving to the jury.the truth-defense, as there was no evidence to support it. But, under Fed.Rules Civ.Proc. rule 51, 28 U.S.C.A., plaintiff was barred from assigning such an error.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It was not so egregious that we may consider it, Rule 51 notwithstanding.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-19\">Plaintiff, in order to recover because of the alleged defamatory remarks other than that as to perjury, was obliged to prove special damages. The judge excluded testimony, which plaintiff offered in an effort to do so. AVe think the judge did not err, since the proposed testimony was too vague, and accordingly might have misled the jury.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> AA/e have considered the several other contentions of plaintiff and find them without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-20\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b540-7\">. Rule 51 provides: \u201cNo party may assign as error the giving or the failure to give an instruction unless he objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating distinctly the matter to which he objects and the grounds of his objection.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b540-8\">. The rulings of the judge occurred in connection with the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-9\">\u201cQ. Now, Mr. Moore, while you were working for the AYaring organization, did you get any other work outside of it through your connection with the various members of the band? A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-10\">\u201cQ. And after you were discharged from the AVaring organization did you get any of this work at all through any connections you had with members of the band individually? A. No, sir, nothing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-11\"><em>X </em>* <em>X </em>* SH *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-12\">\u201cMr. Raftery: I further object on the ground that this is directly not connected with Mr. AYaring. He said through other members of the band.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-13\">\u201cMr. Rapp: I want to show damages, if your Honor please.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-14\">\u201cThe Court:. I know, but how about the last statement which points out what you \u25a0did ask for?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-15\">\u201cMr. Rapp: -AYhat was that, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-16\">\u201cThe Court: X don\u2019t know what that question means. Do you mean' that be-. cause you were deprived of contact with members of the band that you could not get any work? Is that what you mean, or what do you mean?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-22\">\u2756 * \u2756 * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-23\">\u201cThe Court: ' * \u2022 * You said you used to get employment from members of the Waring band or organization, I don\u2019t know which you said, and after your discharge became effective on the 12th, that you did not get any more of it. AYhat did you mean by that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-24\">\u201cThe Witness: I never got any more work through anybody in the organization.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-25\">\u201cThe Court: Did you meet them? Did you have contact with them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-26\">\u201cThe Witness: I met some and was ignored by them. I have been snubbed; people who were my very closest friends \u25a0would not contact me ever again, people I have known even five years before I joined Waring.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-27\">\u201cThe Court: I know, but this employment, I want to know how you connect that with Waring. That is what the lawyer want to know and what I want to know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-28\">\u201cThe Witness: Because anybody that \u2022was in that room when Waring said these things to me has been afraid to have any association with me as long as they were in his employ. I had gotten <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>lots of work through these friends prior to this excoriation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-13\">\n<em>\u201cBy Mr. Rupp:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-14\">\u201cQ. And have you gotten any work from any of these sources since?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-15\">\u201cMr. Raftery: The same objection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-16\">\u201cThe Court: How about it? It sounds like a valid objection to me in view of your client\u2019s answer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-17\">\u201cMr. Rapp: If your Honor please, I want to show that it is part of the damages that Waring has stopped these people from having anything to do with him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-18\">\u201cThe Court: You show that, if you have anything in your complaint to justify it. Presently I will sustain the objection made to the last two questions and strike out the answer to the first.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-19\">\u201cTlie Court: * * * I do not think he can testify to the matter I struck out, and now 1 have allowed you to put in the record that he formerly had access to them, and that some of them gave him employment, and now that access is not either feasible, or maybe it is impossible, I don\u2019t know what his answer means, and therefore the opportunity to got employment is denied, and I think I will lot it stand that way.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-21\">\n<em>\u201cBy Mr. Rapp:</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-22\">\u201cQ. Mr. Moore, what was your income the first year after you left the Waring organization?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-23\">\u201cTlie Court: Prom May to May, you mean? June to June, you mean?'</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-24\">\u201cMr. Rapp: Yes, approximately.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-25\">\u201cMr. Raftery: That is objected to under the pleading. There is no plea of special damage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-26\">\u201cThe Court: How about it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-30\">\u201cMr. Rnpp: There is a plea of special damage. It is right in there.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-31\">\u201cThe Court: What paragraph?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-32\">\u201cMr. Rapp: The 21st, Judge. We have got to prove that his income was affected and how it was affected.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-33\">\u201cThe Court: Well, I do not think giving the dollars of his income before and after is any measure of damages, because that is dependent on a great many causes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-34\">\u201cMr. Rapp: Well, that is for the jury\u2014 \u201cThe Court: Well, I do not think I will allow the jury to hear it, to shut off any speculation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-36\">\u201cMr. Rapp: If your Honor please, I think I have a case in there that holds that the income from a business was proven before the accident happened and directly after it happened.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-37\">\u201cThe Court: Well, I would not know about that, but, anyway, running a business is very different from professional employment. You would call your employment professional even though you were salaried, wouldn\u2019t you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-38\">\u201cThe Witness: Yes, it was professional.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-39\">\u201cThe Court: I would presently sustain the objection, gee if you can approach it some other way. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-40\">:: * S= * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-41\">\u201cMr. Rapp: Will your Honor permit mo to prove any of the income at all, to prove that he had no income after he left the organization as a result of this slander?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b541-42\">\u201cThe Court: Yes, 1 will allow you to prove anything that is the result of the slander.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
