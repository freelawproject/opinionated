The appellant contends that when the vessels sighted each other their headings were such as to call for a starboard to starboard passing. The court discredited the witnesses of the appellant and believed those of the appellee who said the lights were red to red. We cannot say the trial court\u2019s findings of fact on this issue are clearly erroneous. His opinion is reported in The William J. Riddle, 102 F.Supp. 884. It discusses all of the contentions now renewed on the appeal. Nothing is to be gained by a repetition of the discussion. The only possible doubt is whether the American Farmer\u2019s statutory fault in failing to signal when she turned five degrees to her right is enough to fasten contributory fault upon her. Judge Kaufman found that it could not have contributed to the collision. We think he was right. See National Bulk Carriers v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"609\">*609</page-number>United States, 2 Cir., 183 F.2d 405, 409, certiorari denied Burns S. S. Co. v. National Bulk Carries, 340 U.S. 865, 71 S.Ct. 89, 95 L.Ed. 681. The decree is affirmed on the opinion below.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
