These returns, with minor exceptions, accurately disclosed petitioner\u2019s income from his restaurant and tavern business and certain rental income, but failed to report any gains received by petitioner from his gambling activities for the years 1942 through 1945, and grossly understated gambling gains realized during the years 1946 and 1947. On October 26, 1948, petitioner filed amended income tax returns for the years in question, disclosing large sums of previously unreported income \u201cestimated to represent net income from business of speculation\u201d for each of the years. The additional taxes shown to be due on these returns were assessed and, with the exception of the additional assessment for 1947, were paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-24\">In a \u201c90 day\u201d letter dated September 30, 1949, petitioner was advised that a determination of his income tax liability for these years disclosed a deficiency of $164.-25 for 1943 and an overassessment of $996.-09 for 1947, \u201ctogether with fraud penalties in the sum of $19,231.49.\u201d Attached to this letter were schedules showing the manner in which the adjustments and penalties were computed. The schedules disclosed that the penalties were computed on the basis of the additional income reported on the amended returns, as adjusted. Such penalties were asserted under the provisions of \u00a7 293(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 293(b)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>In the Tax Court petitioner urged that in the absence of a determination by the Commissioner of a deficiency in tax, as that term is defined in section 271(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C.A., \u00a7 271(a),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the Commissioner is without authority to assert a fraud penalty in excess of 50 per centum of $164.25, the deficiency determined to be due for 1943 according to the deficiency notice. He also denied that he filed false and fraudulent income tax returns for the years in question. The Tax Court ruled that the Commissioner had authority to assert the fraud penalties and determined from the evidence presented that such penalties were properly asserted, since \u201cpetitioner knew in each year that he should report his gambling gains for income tax purposes just as he was reporting his other income, and that he intended to evade the income taxes imposed upon him by law when he deliberately failed to report any of his gambling gains for 1942 through 1945, and to report all of his gains from gambling for the years 1946 and 1947.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">On this petition for review petitioner renews his contention that the definition of \u201cdeficiency\u201d as set forth in section 271(a) (1) \u201cgoverns the application of that term as found in section 293(b)\u201d so that \u201cthe imposition of the 50 per cent penalty under section 293(b) is limited to 50 per cent of the total amount of the \u2018deficiency\u2019 as the term \u2018deficiency\u2019 is defined in Section 271 (a) for the use in Chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code.\u201d Consequently, since at the time of the assertion of the fraud penalty there was, because of the payment oi the tax as shown to be due by the amended returns, no deficiency existing, as shown by the 90 day letter, except as to the sum of $164.25, the statute furnishes no support for the assertion of the fraud penalty in the sum of $19,231.49. The Commissioner argues, as found by the Tax Court, that \u201cthe total amount of the deficiency\u201d, as used in Section 293(b), supra, refers to the difference between the amount of tax shown to be due on the original return filed by the taxpayer and the amount found to be the legal tax liability for the year, whether this \u201ctotal deficiency\u201d will be made up of one or more deficiencies. It is further contended that the two sections of the statutes have different purposes, \u2014 Section 271(a) to provide a basis of jurisdiction for determination of deficiency by the Tax Court, and Section 293(b) representing a penalty provision applicable to the entire or total deficiency as an addition to the tax.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-10\">The Tax Court has had the same point here presented before it for determination upon several occasions.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The petitioner, though strenuously contesting their correctness, concedes that these several decisions have rejected the construction of the statute which he argues. In, each of them the Tax Court has held that the terms of Section 293(b) require that the 50 per cent fraud penalty be computed upon the total deficiency as therein provided, and that this total deficiency is the difference between the amount of the true tax liability as finally ascertained and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>amount disclosed on the return and that the language of Section 271(a) neither requires nor authorizes a construction of Section 293(b) which would restrict its applicability to the deficiency ascertained under Section 271(a) instead of to the total deficiency as provided in Section 293(b). The petitioner for review has not convinced us of any substantial error in these rulings of the Tax Court. So far as we are aware the rulings of the Commissioner to this effect have been uniform and whenever questioned the Tax Court has upheld this construction. It is an entirely permissible one and we see no reason to overturn it. The 'chief \u25a0 difficulty arises from the fact that the definitive Section 271(a) itself contains, as one of the elements of definition, the term defined. This is well calculated to cause confusion. Thus, in defining deficiency \u201cas used in this chapter in respect of a tax imposed by this chapter\u201d the section, in clause (B), refers to \u201ca deficiency\u201d. In this view of the matter the definition can be said to contemplate an antecedent deficiency which is to be included, in applicable circumstances, in the deficiency which the statute defines. Thus, it can well be said that this statute contemplates more than one deficiency although Section 271(a), evidently relating to the assessment and collection of the true tax, refers to that portion of such tax which is unpaid. However, Section 293(b) provides a penalty, or \u201cadditions to the tax\u201d, computed not upon \u201cany part of any deficiency\u201d but upon \u201cthe total amount of the deficiency\u201d. This latter is, we believe, the sum total of the deficiency referred to in clause (B) and the deficiency otherwise defined by the remaining provisions of Section 271(a). In this view of the matter we can not, and do not, impute to Congress 'by the enactment of Section 271(a) an intention to change the effect of Section 293(b) which it had admittedly provided theretofore.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">The application which we have given provisions of Section 271(a) evidence the rejection of petitioner\u2019s contention that Treasury Regulation 111, Section 29.271-1, supplementing Section 271 which provides that \u201cadditional tax shown on an \u2018amended return\u2019, so called, filed after the due date of the return for the taxable year, is a deficiency within the meaning of the Code\u201d, is in conflict with the statute. The question before us for determination is not whether the additional tax shown by the amended return was properly assessed and collected, but rather whether, under the circumstances of this case to which we have referred, the Commissioner was authorized to assert, and the Tax Court to uphold the assertion of, fraud penalties. We hold that the Commissioner was so authorized and the Tax Court did not err in so holding.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">Nor can petitioner complain of the failure of the Commissioner to include the amount of the additional tax reported on the amended returns in the deficiency notice. Nothing contained in the statute requires this be done. It is necessary only that the penalty be assessed, collected, and paid \u201cin the same manner as if it were a deficiency.\u201d See McLaughlin v. Commissioner, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-7\">No useful purpose would be served to recite the evidence at length. It presents a situation where the taxpayer admits that he intentionally understated his income, but denies that such understatement was made with fraudulent intent to evade the payment of his taxes. The Tax Court considered petitioner\u2019s explanation of his failure to properly report the income in the first instance, but regarded it as unconvincing. On the record as a whole, the Tax Court determined that the Commissioner sustained the burden of proving that the deficiencies were due to fraud with intent to evade the tax. 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1112. This decision is not without factual support in the record. In this case, unli'ke that of Mitchell v. Commissioner, S Cir., 118 F.2d 308, an examination of the findings and opinion of the Tax Court leave no doubt that that Court found and determined that the petitioner knew of the falsity of the returns and made them with the specific purpose of evading a tax which he knew should be returned and paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-8\">The decision of the Tax Court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b142-18\">. \u201c\u00a7 293.
