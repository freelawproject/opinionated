He was found guilty March <em>7, </em>1941. The appeal attacks the denial of a motion to vacate sentence imposed under the verdict and this in turn involves the entry of various orders in the case which are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b574-27\">\u201cJudgment and Commitment, <em>Entered March 13, 1941</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AVg\">\u201cOn this 13th day of March, 1941, same the United States Attorney, and the defendant Casper Crowe appearing in proper person, and by attorney, and,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJi\">\u201cThe defendant having been convicted on verdict of guilty of the offenses charged in the indictment in the above-entitled cause, to wit: Transporting, possessing and concealing tax unpaid whiskey, as charged in the three counts of the indictment, and the defendant having been now asked whether he has anything to say why judgment should not be pronounced against him, and no sufficient cause to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"527\">*527</page-number>the contrary being shown or appearing to the Court, It Is By The Court</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b575-5\">\u201cOrdered And Adjudged that the defendant, having been found guilty of said offenses, is hereby committed to the custody of the Attorney General for imprisonment in an institution of the pen. or reformatory type to be designated by the Attorney General or his authorized representative for the period of One (1) Year And One (1) Day from and after this date on the first count of the indictment.

A petition to vacate or set aside sentence filed by defendant March 17, 1952 was dismissed by the District Court and from the dismissal of the petition this appeal is prosecuted.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-13\">It is contended that the various orders and sentences are invalid either because they were not made in the presence of the prisoner or because they increased his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-14\">The order of March 13, 1941 committing the defendant to the custody of the Attorney General for a year and one day from date was rendered in the presence of the defendant, as also was the probation order entered March 13, 1941, which sentenced the defendant on Counts 2 and 3. However, the order entered March 17, 1941 modifying or amending the order of probation is clearly invalid because it was not entered in the presence of the prisoner. Price v. Zerbst, D.C., 268 F. 72, 74. A leading principle that pervades the entire law of criminal procedure is that, after indictment found, nothing shall be done in the absence of the prisoner. Lewis v. United States, 146 U.S. 370, 372, 13 S.Ct. 136, 137, 36 L.Ed. 1011. The Supreme Court there stated: \u201cAnd it appears to be well settled that, 'where the personal presence is necessary in point of law, the record must show the fact.\u201d Wilson v. Bell, 6 Cir., 137 F.2d 716.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"529\">*529</page-number> The order revoking probation was entered in the presence of the defendant within the two year period. It, therefore, was valid. The order of judgment and commitment entered October 19, 1942 was in the defendant\u2019s presence but it is invalid because it increases the sentence imposed originally on the second and third counts, Frankel v. United States, 6 Cir., 131 F.2d 756. This court there held it is not within the power of the court to increase a sentence when punishment has already been partly suffered under the original sentence. In this case the defendant had served part of his sentence at the time the order of October 19, 1942 was entered.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-4\">The increase in the defendant\u2019s sentence made by this order is substantial. In the entry of March 13, 1941 the sentences of five years on the second count and three years on the third count were ordered to run concurrently and to become effective at the expiration of the sentence on the first count, that is, the sentence of a year and a day. The judgment and commitment of October 19, 1942 was for a period of five years \u201cfrom and after this date\u201d on the second count and three years \u201cfrom and after this date\u201d on the third count. But \u201cthis date,\u201d October 19, 1942, is over seven months more than a year and a day from March 13, 1941, the date of the defendant\u2019s first sentence. The order increases the original sentence by over seven months. Hence, the judgment of October 19, 1942 is void to the extent of its excess over the valid sentences of March 13, 1941. In re Bonner, 151 U.S. 242, 14 S.Ct. 323, 38 L.Ed. 149; Ex parte Lange, 18 Wall. 163, 85 U.S. 163, 21 L.Ed. 872; Wilson v. Bell, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-5\">It follows that the defendant is entitled to have the sentence corrected. He is now in the penitentiary at Atlanta, Ga. serving a term for robbery. The Government contends that the District Court has no jurisdiction to correct the sentence, since the defendant is confined under a sentence different from that involved herein. We think there is no merit in this contention. The court has authority to vacate or correct an erroneous sentence, not only during but after the term. The authorities on this point are reviewed in Wilson v. Bell, supra. It would be a drastic and improper limitation upon the inherent power o\u00ed the court if it could not correct its own clearly erroneous judgment, because of the fact that the defendant asking for correction was serving a sentence at the time under a different judgment. The erroneous judgment is still in force against him. Moreover, actual prejudice is created by the judgment of October 19, 1942. The defendant states, and it is not denied, that the United States Board of Paroles has placed a warrant against the defendant which necessitates his serving the balance of the five years under this erroneous sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b577-8\">The case is remanded to the District Court with instructions to correct the sentence in accordance with the opinion herein.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b574-28\">. Appellant will be denominated defendant throughout this opinion.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
