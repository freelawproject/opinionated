But to fall outside the scope of the Housing and Rent Act of 1947, as amended, 50 U.S.C. A.Appendix \u00a7 1881 et seq., the use of the premises must be predominately commercial, Jacobs v. United States of America, 1 Cir., 1952, 199 F.2d 396, and consequently there was an issue of fact which required the trial judge to deny summary judgment. Appellants\u2019 other -contentions are sufficiently answered in the opinion of the court below, 105 F.Supp. 568.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-9\">For the foregoing reasons the order is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
