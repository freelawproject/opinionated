Federal jurisdiction rests upon diversity of citizenship and amount in controversy. Title 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b654-17\">The payments involved were made on a promissory note payable in instalments, and the plaintiff\u2019s action is bottomed on the proposition that it was beyond the bankrupt corporation\u2019s powers <em>(ultra vires) </em>for it to make the payments. Two reasons are advanced for this. First it is said that the corporation was merely an accommodation endorser of the note upon which it made the payments, and that it had no power under Massachusetts law to endorse for accommodation only. Second it is said that to the defendant\u2019s knowledge the money borrowed on the note was not for the use and benefit of the corporation, but instead was intended for, and in fact was used by, one DiTulio to finance his purchase of all the stock in the corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b654-18\">The case was tried on oral testimony and exhibits, and while that evidence provides some factual basis for the plaintiff\u2019s position, the District Court thought otherwise. It found that DiTulio signed the note in question, which was payable to the bankrupt, and that the bankrupt endorsed the note over to the defendant. It also found that as part of the transaction the bankrupt gave the defendant a mortgage of all its corporate assets, and DiTulio gave the defendant an assignment covering all the corporation\u2019s stock which he had just purchased. And it found that thereafter the bankrupt made payments on the note in accordance with its terms. But the court said that it could not \u201csubscribe to the Trustee\u2019s theory that the loan was really being made to DiTulio personally so that he could purchase the stock.\u201d It found that there were pre-existing corporate debts to two banks which DiTulio wanted discharged, that the defendant advanced money on the note \u201cto the corporation in order that it might discharge its own corporate debts, substituting the defendant for the two banks,\u201d and that there was \u201cnothing irregular about this transaction between the corporation and the defendant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b654-19\">The entire transaction in which the note under consideration played a part was a complicated one involving the sale of all the corporation\u2019s stock to DiTulio and discharge of all the corporation\u2019s debts as a prerequisite thereto. No useful purpose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>would be served by describing it in detail. It will suffice for us to say that we find evidence in the record to sustain the District Court\u2019s findings of fact, and that those findings support that court\u2019s ultimate conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b655-5\">The judgment of the District Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
