Howell, 210 Miss. 383, 49 So.2d 701. The complaint claims federal jurisdiction on the ground of diversity of citizenship, alleging but not specifying fraud and seeking to invoke the equity powers of the federal court to' annul the will of J. D. Lanham, deceased, hoping thereby to vest the entire estate in his heirs at law. Two of the persons who would be heirs at law of J. D. Lanham, deceased, if he had died intestate, are residents of Mississippi ; and if they were made parties, the court would be deprived of jurisdiction. While logically the question of jurisdiction should be the first decided, the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"800\">*800</page-number>passed it over because it seemed so entirely clear that the matter was <em>res judicata. </em>We agree. The final judgment in the state court on the merits between the same parties is conclusive in this court. Jarrard v. Southeastern Shipbuilding Corporation, 5 Cir., 163 F.2d 960, 961; Hudson v. Lewis, 1 Cir., 188 F.2d 679, 680; Larter &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Dinkier Hotels Company, Inc, 5 Cir., 199 F.2d 854. The judgment is therefore Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
