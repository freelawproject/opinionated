Automobile Financing, Inc., 5 Cir., 99 F.2d 498, affirmed in 307 U.S. 219, 59 S.Ct. 861, 83 L.Ed. 1249; and that, as was held of the judgment in that case, the entry of the judgment here was well within the discretion confided to the district judge. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">There is nothing in the findings of the court or in the record to support the contention that claimant, as assignee of the paper, had any recourse for the moneys advanced on account of it, against the dealer from whom it took it. Moreover, there is nothing in the statute or in any of the controlling decisions which supports the view advanced by the appellant that where it is made to appear that a claimant for remission may, in addition to his claim to the car, have a cause of action to the sums advanced on account of its purchase of the paper, remission of forfeiture must he denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-14\">This is not to say that the district judge may not, in the exercise of his discretion, take such facts into consideration in determining on the record as a whole whether the forfeiture should he remitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-15\">It is to say, though, that the effect to be given to such facts and the actions to be taken by him, in the light of all the facts and circumstances, were confided to the discretion of the district judge, and that discretion having been exercised in favor of remission, the facts may not now be put forward as a basis for reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-16\">The judgment is Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"A2z\">. In his conclusions of law, the court, after holding that the claimant should have. the remission, added, \u201cthe claimant to be' taxed with the costs.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b549-6\">. \u201cUpon tlie petition of intervention of the Commercial Credit Corporation, the Court makes the following finding of fact and conclusion of law:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-7\">' \u201c1. The Commercial Credit Corporation acquired the contract executed by James Williams to the Dealer in good faith for a valuable consideration before the maturity of the paper and long before. the, truck was seized;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-8\">\u201c2. That this contract was purchased by the Commercial Credit Corporation in good faith for a valuable consideration, and that it owned an interest by virtue of that contract in the piek-np truck at the time that it was seized;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-9\">\u201c3. The court further finds that James Williams, who executed the contract, had no reputation or record for violation of the Internal Kevenue Daws and that while no inquiry was made of the Alcohol Tax Unit or any other officer, yet if such inquiry had been made, the Commercial Credit Corporation would have received a negative answer;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-12\">\u201c4. The court further finds that James Williams actually owned an interest in the automobile to the extent at least of $200.-00, and that the automobile was sold by the Dealer to James Williams because the said lames Williams did have a good reputation, and that the Dealer would not have sold the truck to Charlie Wilbert because he had a record, but that in good faith and for a valuable consideration paid by James Williams, the Dealer sold the truck to James Williams, accepted a valid contract from him which obligated and required him, as a matter of law, to pay the deferred payments upon the contract, and that sale to the said James Williams was, therefore, a valid and lawful sale;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-18\">\u201c5. That the said James Williams was not the \u2018straw man\u2019 as is contemplated by law of a sale to a straw man.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-19\">\u201cThe Court therefore concludes as a matter of law that;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b549-20\">\u201cThe claim of the Commercial Credit Corporation should be allowed and that the car should be foi-foited to the Government subject to the claim of the Commercial Credit Corporation; * * * \u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
