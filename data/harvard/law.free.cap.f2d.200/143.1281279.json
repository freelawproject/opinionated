B. Thompson, for the vacation of a sentence of imprisonment imposed by the District Court on March 18, 1949. The sentence was based upon the defendant\u2019s plea of guilty to an indictment returned January 7, 1949, which charged: \u201cThat on or about November 7,. 1948, Williner Banard Thompson transported a stolen motor vehicle from Lincoln, State of Nebraska, in the Lincoln Division of the District of Nebraska, to Pawhuska in the State of Oklahoma, and he then knew the motor vehicle to have been stolen. (18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2312).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">Upon his arraignment on March 3, 1949, the defendant was asked the following questions by Government counsel and by the court, and made the following\u2019answers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-10\">\u201cMr. Deming: Are you Williner Bernard Thompson?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-11\">\u201cDefendant: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-12\">\u201cMr. Deming: You are charged in an indictment with transporting a stolen automobile from Lincoln, Nebraska, to the state of Oklahoma. This case was venued in the Lincoln Division. The 25th of February, you signed a request to have this case transferred from the Lincoln Division to the Omaha Division for disposition, and at the time, before you' signed it, you were advised of your rights to have an attorney, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-13\">\u201cDefendant: That is correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-14\">\u201cMr. Deming: And you waived any right to consultation at that time of the request for transfer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-15\">\u201cDefendant: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-16\">\u201cThe Court: What is your disposition now in the matter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-17\">\u201cDefendant: I remain the same.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-18\">\u201cThe Court: I want to know if it still continues and whether he adheres to his waiver of the right to be represented by counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-19\">\u201cMr. Deming: How old are you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-20\">\u201cDefendant: 46.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-21\">\u201cMr. Deming: What education have you had?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-22\">\u201cDefendant: Highschool.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-23\">\u201cMr. Deming: What business have you been in ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-24\">\u201cDefendant: I have been in lots of businesses. Worked on the railroad; farmed for myself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-25\">\u201cMr. Deming: Do you have a family?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-26\">\u201cDefendant: Not now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-27\">\u201cMr. Deming: Do you have funds with which to hire an attorney?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-28\">\u201cDefendant: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-29\">\u201cMr. Deming: You understand a man charged with a crime in federal court, such as this, if he does not have funds to hire an attorney, the court will appoint one to advise and consult with him ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-30\">\u201cDefendant: I do.\u25a0</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-31\">\u201cMr. Deming: Understanding that, and understanding you are charged with transportation of a stolen motor vehicle, for which the penalty is a fine of not more than five thousand dollars, maximum, nor more than five years, or both, do you desire to have the court appoint an attorney for you before proceeding?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-32\">\u201cDefendant: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-33\">\u201cMr. Deming: You waive the appointment of an attorney?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-34\">\u201cDefendant: I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-35\">' \u201cMr. Deming: Are you ready for arraignment ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-36\">\u201cDefendant: I am.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-37\">\u201cMr. Deming: Let me ask you, have you had a copy of this indictment ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>\u201cDefendant: I have it in my pocket, and I saw a copy of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-5\">\u201cMr. Deming: Nevertheless, at this time, I would like to deliver a copy to. you and get a receipt from you for it. I hand you the indictment. I sign as witness. Dated it March 3, 1949. I file the receipt. Are you ready for arraignment ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-6\">\u201cDefendant: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-7\">\u201cMr. Deming: (Reading indict-</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-8\">ment). How do you plead to the one count of the indictment?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-9\">\u201cDefendant: Guilty as charged.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-10\">At the time the defendant was sentenced on March 18, 1949, the following proceedings were had:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-11\">\u201cMr. Deming: Are you Williner Bernard Thompson ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-12\">\u201cDefendant: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-13\">\u201cMr. Deming: I see you do not have an attorney?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-14\">\u201cDefendant: No sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-15\">\u201cMr. Deming: You were advised of your rights to have an attorney previously, is that correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-16\">\u201cDefendant: That is right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-17\">\u201cMr. Deming: You understand that even at this stage you have the right to ask for the appointment of an attorney ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-18\">\u201cDefendant: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-19\">\u201cMr. Deming: Is it your desire to proceed to sentence without the services of an attorney, or do you desire to have one appointed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-20\">\u201cDefendant: I don\u2019t need one.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-21\">\u201cMr. Deming: In other words, you waive the appointment of an attorney at this time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-22\">\u201cDefendant: That is right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-23\">\u201cThe Court: Mr. Williner Bernard Thompson, you were indicted by a grand jury, charged with the offense of transporting a <em>stolen </em>automobile in interstate commerce. To that indictment you have entered a plea of guilty. Is there anything you wish to say now why sentence of the court should not be pronounced?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-25\">\u201cDefendant: No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-26\">\u201cThe Court: It is just one count?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-27\">\u201cMr. Deming: Just one count, your honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-28\">\u201cThe Court: It is the sentence of the court that you shall be confined to the custody of the Attorney General of the United States for a period of five years, and that as part of the sentence, the firearms and ammunition which you had in your possession and which were seized by the Government officers, be confiscated to the Bureau of Federal Investigation, the F. B. I. These articles consisted of a pistol, and what else?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-29\">\u201cMr. Deming: .32 caliber U. S. make revolver; #51291 .32 caliber automatic pistol; #3660 .22 caliber Liberty model revolver serial No. 507410-12, M over M x Choke, II. R. Handy Gun, serial #21382.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b193-30\">The defendant on June 9, 1952, filed a motion under \u00a7 2255, Title 28 U.S.C.A., for the vacation of his sentence, based upon the claim that the motor vehicle he was charged with having transported was not stolen within the meaning of \u00a7 2312, Title 18 U.S.C.A., but was procured from its owner by the use of a fraudulent check. The defendant asserted, therefore, that he had erroneously pleaded guilty to an erroneous charge and had been erroneously sentenced for a crime he did not commit.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-31\">The files and records of the District Court conclusively showed that the defendant was charged with transporting a stolen motor vehicle in interstate commerce, knowing that it had been stolen; and that he was offered the assistance of counsel, waived his right to counsel, and voluntarily entered a plea of \u201cGuilty as charged.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b193-32\">\u201cA plea .of guilty differs in purpose and effect from a mere admission or an extrajudicial confession; it is itself a conviction. Like a verdict of a jury it is conclusive. More is <em>not </em>required; the court has nothing to do but give judgment and sentence.\u201d Kercheval v. United States, 274 U.S. 220, 223, 47 S.Ct. 582, 583, 71 L.Ed. 1009.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>The defendant having convicted himself by advisedly and voluntarily entering a plea of guilty, there was no basis for an order vacating the sentence which the law authorized the District Court to impose, and no occasion for a hearing upon his motion to vacate the sentence. The question whether the motor vehicle referred to in the indictment was stolen or was procured by fraud was foreclosed by the defendant\u2019s plea and was not an issue which could be tried on a motion to vacate sentence. See Godish v. United States, 10 Cir., 182 F.2d 342 and cases cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">The order appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
