In Fis\u25a0wick\u2019s case, note 5, supra, on which appellants so strongly rely, in support of the claimed error in admitting Burks\u2019 statement, the court charged the jury that each statement was admissible not only against its maker but against the other defendants also. Further, if there was error here, the admission was expressly limited to count one, and the sentences imposed were less than could have been imposed on the other counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-20\">Having wholly failed to properly make below the points they now seek to make against the proceedings and judgment, that it was error against them to admit Burks\u2019 statement, and that the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict and judgment, appellants find themselves confined to maintaining here that the record is so wholly devoid of evidence pointing to guilt that it is plain that justice has miscarried. Recognizing that this is his burden, counsel who represents appellants on their, appeal has attempted to sustain it by imparting to his brief and argument a certain grandiosity of approach to, a certain grandiloquence of treatment of, the constitutional principles he invokes, the claimed errors of omission and commission he belabors, and the corrective results he seeks.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-21\">Unfortunately, however, the record does not support appellants\u2019 claims, that they have been deprived of due process, that, in violation of constitutional principles, they have been unjustly convicted. The story it unfolds, if the witnesses for the United States are to be believed, and the judge did believe them, is a crass and sor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>did one of crimes committed by stealth; intrigue, and chicanery, with Gates and Burks the puppets, and Henderson the mastermind.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">No reversible error; no miscarriage of justice, appearing, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b84-14\">.
