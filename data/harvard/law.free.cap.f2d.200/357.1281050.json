There is no dispute about the facts. Appellee was the beneficiary named in the policy. The insured described her as his cousin but she was not his cousin. When he entered military service he had lived with appellee and her family, and she had treated him like a son, for a number of years. This began <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>when he was 28, appellee 33, and appellee\u2019s husband 31. The insured died September 12, 1944. .</p>\n<p id=\"b406-4\">Disregarding a 1946 amendment not pertinent here, 60 Stat. 782, \u00a7 4, 38 U.\u2019S.'C. A. \u00a7 802(g), the National Service Life Insurance Act of 1940 forbids payment to the named beneficiary unless she stands in one of several specified relationships to the insured. These include \u201cparent\u201d. 54 Stat. 1010, \u00a7 602(g), 38 U..S.CA. \u00a7 802(g). The Act also provides that \u201cThe terms \u2018parent\u2019, \u2018father\u2019, and \u2018mother\u2019 include a father, mother, father through adoption, mother through adoption, <em>persons mho have stood in loco parentis to a member of the military or naval forces at wny time prior to entry into active service </em>for a period of not less than one year, and a stepparent, if designated as beneficiary by the insured.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) 60 Stat. 781, \u00a7 1, 38.U.S.C.A. \u00a7 801(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">As appellant says, the question is \"Whether one claiming to be <em>in loco parentis </em>to an insured serviceman is a permitted beneficiary under Section 602(g) of the National Service Life Insurance Act where the relationship had its inception after the insured, who was neither physically nor mentally incapacitated, had reached his majority.\u201d We think he is a permitted beneficiary.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> \u201cThe words, in loco parentis, merely translated, mean \u2018in the place of a parent.\u2019 The ordinary meaning of a person standing in loco pare-ntis would, therefore, seem to be a person standing in the relation of, or assuming the relation of a parent to another. * * * Since, then, it is our view that there is no generally accepted common law meaning of the phrase, in loco parentis,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the natural and ordinary meaning, as heretofore indicated, is to be given the term, and the statute is to be liberally construed to carry out the intention of the insured.\u201d Thomas v. United States, 6 Cir., 189 F.2d 494, 497, 505. The Supreme Court has construed quite as liberally the word \u201cbrother\u201d, in the same statute, by applying it to an adopted son of the parents of the insured. Wodward v. United States, 341 U.S. 112, 71 S.Ct. 605, 95 L.Ed. 648.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">In a supplemental memorandum the appellant says : \u201cWe contend here only that an <em>in loco parentis </em>relationship must have its inception during the minority oi the insured, unless the insured was mentally or physically incapacitated, not that a relationship so initiated cannot continue after the majority of the insured.\u201d But we see no good reason why this voluntary relation which may exist during majority may not begin during majority. The legislative history on which appellant relies does not answer the question. It tends to show that Congress believed the term <em>in loco parentis </em>to have a legal sense and that Congress intended to use the term in this sense,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> but it does not suggest that this sense would exclude persons in appellee\u2019s position. The administrative .construction on which appellant relies seems to us clearly erroneous.
