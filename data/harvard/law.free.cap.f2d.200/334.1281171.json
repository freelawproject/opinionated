Blackmar v. Guerre, 342 U.S. 512, 72 S.Ct. 410. The Blackmar decision apparently was not called to the attention of the court below, and only the merits were dealt with by Judge McGohey in his opinion dismissing the complaint, 106 F.Supp. 373. But in our view the reasoning of the Supreme Court in Blackmar v. Guerre, supra, evidently required a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-17\">Accordingly the judgment of the district court' should be modified by directing the dismissal of the complaint for lack of jurisdiction and as so modified is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
