D.C., 100 F.Supp. 46.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-17\">Citing as authority to the contrary the holding of the Jefferson Circuit Court, plaintiff, appealing from the judgment, is here vigorously insisting that the district judge \u2018was in fundamental error in holding that the first count stated an action not in contract but in tort, which was barred in one year.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-18\">Calling to our attention that, in Tennessee Coal, Iron &amp; Railroad Company v. Charles Ross Sizemore, the appeal of the Jefferson Circuit Court case, the question presented here had been argued before, and submitted to, the Supreme Court of Alabama, and was pending there for decision, appellant insisted that the action of the Jefferson Circuit Court would almost certainly be affirmed; while the appellee, with equal confidence, asserted the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-19\">Of the opinion that this court should not undertake to decide the question hut should, under the circumstances, await the decision by the Supreme Court of the state of the question of statutory construction presented for decision there and here, we deferred acting upon the appeal until we had tlje benefit of the state court\u2019s views.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-20\">That court has now affirmed the judgment appealed from and, in its opinion, Ala.Sup., 62 So.2d 459, determined the controlling question for decision here in accordance with the contention of the appellant. The judgment appealed from is accordingly reversed and the cause is remanded for further and not inconsistent proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-21\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
