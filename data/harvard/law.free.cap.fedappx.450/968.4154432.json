Shinseki, </em>No. 09-4105, 2011 WL 1130380 (Vet.App. Mar. 29, 2011). The Veterans Court affirmed a July 7, 2009, Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals (\u201cBoard\u201d) decision, which held that Parker had not submitted new and material evidence to show that his bad-conduct discharge was not a bar to Department of Veterans Affairs (\u201cVA\u201d) benefits. We <em>dismiss.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b589-16\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b589-17\">Parker served on active duty in the Air Force from February 1985 to October 1990. In December 1988, Parker struck a police officer during arrest for possession of marijuana and cocaine. Parker pled guilty in his court-martial proceedings to possession and use of marijuana and cocaine, resisting arrest, and striking a police officer. In October 1990, he was sentenced to a reduction in paygrade, confinement for 18 months, and a bad-conduct discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-19\">Parker submitted a claim for VA disability benefits in January 1991. In August 1991, a VA regional office (\u201cRO\u201d) determined that Parker was barred from benefits due to his bad-conduct discharge. The Board affirmed this decision in August 1994. Parker did not appeal this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b589-21\">In June 2005, Parker sought to reopen his claim but did not submit any new evidence, so the RO denied his request to reopen his claim in September 2005. Parker appealed this decision to the Board, and he submitted new evidence to the Board along with this appeal. In July 2009, the Board declined to reopen Parker\u2019s claim after determining that the new evidence was cumulative of testimony already in the record or was immaterial to his bad-conduct discharge. The Veterans <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1232\">*1232</page-number>Court affirmed, holding that this decision was not clearly erroneous. <em>Parker v. Shinseki, </em>No. 09-4105, 2011 WL 1130380 (Vet.App. Mar. 29, 2011). Parker timely appealed to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"AhR\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"AK_G\">Under 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(c), our jurisdiction to review Veterans Court decisions is limited to \u201cchallenge[s] to the validity of any statute or regulation or any interpretation thereof.\u201d We may not review \u201c(A) a challenge to a factual determination, or (B) a challenge to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a particular case\u201d unless the appeal \u201cpresents a constitutional issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 7292(d)(2); <em>see Guillory v. Shinseki, </em>603 F.3d 981, 987 (Fed.Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"AK6\">A veteran discharged \u201cby reason of the sentence of a general court-martial\u201d is not entitled to VA benefits unless \u201cat the time of the commission of [the] offense ... that person was insane.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5303(a)-(b). Because Parker did not appeal the Board\u2019s 1994 denial of benefits, absent clear and unmistakable error, his claim could be reopened only \u201c [i]f new and material evidence is presented or secured.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5108. VA regulations state that \u201c[n]ew and material evidence can be neither cumulative nor redundant of the evidence of record ... and must raise a reasonable possibility of substantiating a claim.\u201d 38 C.F.R. \u00a7 3.156(a).</p>\n<p id=\"AgU\">Parker does not challenge the validity or interpretation of the applicable statutes and regulations. The only issue before the Veterans Court was whether Parker had submitted new and material evidence during the 2009 Board proceeding. Parker appears to argue that he submitted new and material evidence both concerning the validity of the court-martial proceeding and his sanity. The Board\u2019s determination that the new evidence was cumulative and immaterial is a factual issue outside the scope of our review. <em>See </em>38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2). This court is without jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"Agm\">Costs</p>\n<p id=\"AC8\">No costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
