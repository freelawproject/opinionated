The trial court directed that LaGrone be reinstated to his position as an engineer with the Port of Oakland, a department of the City, with backpay and benefits. We conclude the judgment is supported by the evidence. We also conclude the court\u2019s decision to deny LaGrone\u2019s request for attorney fees was within its discretion. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">\n<em>LaGrone Is Laid Off from His Position with the Port</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b793-8\">LaGrone worked for the Port as a civil engineer from 1981 to 2008. Over the years he was promoted from junior civil engineer to assistant civil engineer and, ultimately, to associate civil engineer. In May 2002, when LaGrone was an assistant civil engineer, the Port renamed its engineering job descriptions by adding \u201cPort\u201d to the job titles. The new job title had no effect on LaGrone\u2019s duties.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-9\">As a general matter, and as we shall explain in more detail, City jobs fall within specified classes. The City\u2019s personnel manual defines \u201cclass or class of positions\u201d as \u201ca position or group of positions for which a common descriptive job title may be used, as defined by similar education, experience, knowledge, duties, qualifications and compensation schedule.\u201d Similarly, the Personnel Rules and Procedures of the Port of Oakland (Port Rules) define a job class as \u201ca definitely recognized kind of employment in the Port or City service (1) which is designated to embrace all positions sufficiently similar with respect to the duties, requirements as to education, experience, knowledge, ability or other qualifications required of incumbents; (2) for which similar tests of fitness may be used in choosing qualified appointees; and (3) a similar compensation schedule may be made to apply with equity and uniformity.\u201d When layoffs occur, more senior employees within a particular job class or classification are entitled to \u201cbump\u201d less senior employees in the same class, so that the more senior employee can remain employed and the less senior employee will be laid off.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-10\">In August 2008, LaGrone was notified by Port Executive Director Omar Benjamin that his position was being eliminated as part of the new operating budget and that he had insufficient seniority credits to \u201cbump\u201d any other Port <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"936\">*936</page-number>employee in his job classification. But, Benjamin explained: \u201csince the Port and the City of Oakland are under a comprehensive personnel system, and based upon your seniority credits in the classification of Port Associate Engineer (Civil Work) you do have seniority over other employees in the Civil Engineer classification at the City of Oakland and will bump a less senior City of Oakland employee in this classification.\u201d Therefore, Benjamin notified LaGrone he was being reassigned to a civil engineer position with the City\u2019s Community &amp; Economic Development Agency (CEDA). The following week the City sent LaGrone a letter confirming his new appointment to CEDA.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-4\">Around that time Acting City Administrator Dan Lindheim learned that a number of Port engineers were being laid off and had been notified they had the right to \u201cbump\u201d into City engineering positions. Lindheim felt the fiscal and managerial ramifications of allowing Port employees to bump into City positions would be \u201cdevastating\u201d for the City. After he learned that the Port had previously refused to allow some City engineers to bump into Port positions and consulted with the city attorney, Lindheim concluded the City was not required to allow Port engineers to bump into City positions. He informed Benjamin that the City would decline to accept the Port employees. \u201cAs you know, the Port Commission has the authority, and has frequently exercised the authority to create Port-specific classifications. Employees in these classes do not have the right to \u2018bump\u2019 into City positions. It appears that the Port Commission has exercised that authority with respect to the engineering, human resource and accountant classes, creating Port-specific classes.\u201d On September 11, 2008, LaGrone was notified that the City would not accept laid-off Port employees in his classification. Because there were no available Port positions in his classification, he was laid off effective September 26, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">\n<em>The Administrative Proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">LaGrone appealed the City\u2019s decision to its civil service board on the ground that the layoff violated the Oakland City Charter and both the City\u2019s and Port\u2019s personnel rules. He asserted that the Port\u2019s associate civil engineer positions were in a common job classification with the City\u2019s civil engineer positions, and that he was entitled to bump into a City position within the same classification. The City argued LaGrone had no right to bump into a City position because his classification was a \u201cPort specific,\u201d not a citywide, engineering classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"937\">*937</page-number>An administrative hearing was held before the civil service board. LaGrone testified he understood he had the right to bump less senior City employees within his current and former job classifications in the event of a layoff. He asserted that the renaming of his position in 2002 did not change his job classification and was inconsistent with the City\u2019s and Port\u2019s personnel rules and procedures for classification changes. Moreover, his duties and responsibilities remained the same after his job title changed.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-5\">LaGrone testified that in 2001 he applied to transfer to an assistant civil engineer position with the City, and that engineers commonly transferred between the City and the Port at that time. He took the City\u2019s promotional examination, was placed on the eligibility list for the City civil engineer position, and renewed his position on the transfer list in 2003. Under the Port Rules, employees can only put their names on transfer lists for positions within the same job classification. \u201cAny permanent classified employee may be transferred or request a special or permanent transfer from one appointing authority to another with the consent of the employee and the approval of the personnel director, and the consent of the appointing authority concerned, provided the positions are in the same or similar class.\u201d (Port Rules, \u00a7 5.09.)</p>\n<p id=\"b795-6\">The City argued LaGrone had no right to bump into a City position because the Port associate engineer classification and the City civil engineer classification are not common classes. Although the Port is a department of the City, it operates autonomously in a number of respects and has its own personnel department, personnel procedures and rules. Under those rules, the Port commissioners have the authority to create new job classifications within the Port. The Port conducts its own recruitment process for all Port jobs independent of the City\u2019s recruitment process.</p>\n<p id=\"b795-7\">Historically, the City and Port would confer and agree on what they considered to be \u201ccity-wide\u201d or \u201ccommon\u201d job classifications. At the time of the 2008 layoffs both City and Port human resources staff initially believed that Port associate engineer and City civil engineer classifications were common classes. But, after the acting city administrator looked into the matter, the City decided the Board of Port Commissioners had created a new, Port-specific classification for LaGrone\u2019s job when it renamed the job in 2002. After that change only Port employees could apply for a promotion to Port associate engineer, and Port associate engineers were protected from being bumped by or having to compete with City-employed engineers for promotions.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"938\">*938</page-number>Jamie Pritchett is the City\u2019s principal human resource analyst and was the City\u2019s layoff coordinator in 2008. She testified that the Port Commission approves both the creation of Port job classifications and changes in existing job classifications. When the Port renames a position \u201cPort-specific,\u201d it bars City employees from applying for or transferring into it. In the past, the City and Port would compare job descriptions and qualifications to determine which job classifications would be treated as common. Not all Port jobs have common classifications with the City, and not all City positions have common classifications with the Port. During the 2008 layoffs Pritchett initially determined the Port associate engineer and City civil engineer positions were common classifications. Later, Lindheim told her that positions the Port identified as Port-specific could not be common to City classifications. The City did not have a list of the common classifications as between the Port and the City, but it was in the process of creating one. The City\u2019s classification plan was not a written document \u201cthe way it[ i]s stated in the City\u2019s civil service rules,\u201d but \u201cis more of a concept as opposed to an actual document.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b796-4\">Lindheim also testified for the City. He had met with the city attorney regarding whether the Port engineer positions targeted for layoffs were \u201cPort-specific,\u201d and obtained a written opinion from the city attorney indicating he could treat them as such.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He had not read the Port\u2019s personnel rules and did not know whether they controlled how classification changes are made.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-5\">The City also presented written and oral testimony from Wing Tak Lau, principal civil engineer with CEDA. Lau had once considered applying for a job transfer to the Port, but he was told by the Port\u2019s human resources department that the position he sought was restricted to Port employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-6\">LaGrone introduced a July 31, 2008 letter to his union, Western Council of Engineers (WCE), from Port counsel Jones Day, responding to the union\u2019s request for information. Jones Day stated that the Port\u2019s job classifications for civil engineers were common with specified City engineer classifications. This letter amended an earlier response sent on July 25, 2008, in which Jones Day said that none of the classifications represented by WCE were common with any City classification.</p>\n<p id=\"b796-7\">The City introduced a July 14, 2008 letter from Port human resources director Debora Preston to the City. Preston\u2019s letter contained a list of common classifications that did not include the engineering classifications. The letter referred to an attached May 17, 1994 letter from the Port\u2019s personnel manager to the City\u2019s manager of employment and classification <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"939\">*939</page-number>that said the list had been agreed upon by a city council resolution, but the attachment was not included in the City\u2019s evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">The civil service board denied LaGrone\u2019s appeal and made the following findings of fact: \u201c(1) The Port established \u2018port specific\u2019 job classifications which protected Port employees by not allowing City employees to transfer into those classifications. The creation of \u2018port specific\u2019 classifications was a practice generally accepted by both the City and the Port and had continued for several years, [f] (2) Port employees in the Port Associate Engineer classification were represented by Western Council of Engineers (WCE) and City employees in the Civil Engineer classification were represented by IFPTE, Local 21. The representation by two different unions was significant because it indicated there was a distinction between the two classifications, [ft] (3) The law firm Jones Day issued a letter on behalf of the Port of Oakland opining that there were no shared classifications between employees represented by WCE and City employees. Jones Day then reversed its opinion without any explanation of its research or reasoning, [f] (4) The determination of which classifications were considered city-wide common classifications for the purpose of establishing seniority in the event of a lay-off was based on mutual agreement between the City and the Port. The City and the Port did not mutually agree that appellant\u2019s classification was a city-wide classification.\u201d From these findings, the board drew the legal conclusion that \u201cat the time appellant was laid off, the Port Associate Engineer classification was not a city-wide classification, and thus appellant had no bumping rights into a City engineering position.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b797-6\">\n<em>The Writ Petition</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b797-7\">LaGrone petitioned for a writ of mandate under Code of Civil Procedure sections 1094.5 and 1094.6.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The trial court ruled that the preponderance of evidence established LaGrone was improperly denied his right to bump into a City position under the applicable layoff rules. The court noted that while article IX, section 902, subdivision (c) of the Oakland City Charter exempts specified Port positions from the City\u2019s civil service rules, LaGrone\u2019s was not an exempt position. The court further found there was no evidence the Port\u2019s 2002 renaming of LaGrone\u2019s position removed it from its previously acknowledged common classification with City engineering positions: \u201cWhile there is some evidence in the record to suggest that the Port treated certain positions, including the Port Associate Engineer, as limited to Port employees, at least in terms of promotional opportunities, this does not establish that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"940\">*940</page-number>the position was excluded from the common classification under the applicable provisions of the Charter, particularly for purposes of layoffs. The fact that the position was retitled by Port Ordinance in 2002 did not [a]ffect the exclusion of the position from the general civil service rules, as it was not followed with an action of the Civil Service Board determining that the position was \u2018peculiar to the operations of the Port.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b798-4\">The court concluded LaGrone\u2019s position at the time of the layoff was in a common classification and subject to the rules allowing bumping and reversion into a previously held classification, regardless of whether the available position was with the Port or the City. The court ordered a writ to issue requiring the City to reinstate LaGrone and allow him to exercise his bumping rights into an appropriate position, with backpay and benefits. LaGrone moved unsuccessfully for attorney fees pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 1021.5 and Labor Code section 218.5. Both parties filed timely appeals, which we have consolidated for purposes of briefing, argument and decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">I. <em>The Writ</em></p>\n<p id=\"ADY\">A. <em>Standards of Review</em></p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">In ruling on an application for a writ of mandate, the trial court uses its independent judgment to determine whether the weight of the evidence supports the administrative decision. <em>(Lake v. Reed </em>(1997) 16 Cal.4th 448, 456-457 [65 Cal.Rptr.2d 860, 940 P.2d 311].) However, the court \u201cmust afford a strong presumption of correctness concerning the administrative findings, and the party challenging the administrative decision bears the burden of convincing the court that the administrative findings are contrary to the weight of the evidence.\u201d <em>(Fukuda v. City of Angels </em>(1999) 20 Cal.4th 805, 817 [85 Cal.Rptr.2d 696, 977 P.2d 693].)</p>\n<p id=\"b798-8\">On appeal from an order granting a writ of administrative mandamus, this court reviews the record to determine whether the trial court\u2019s findings are supported by substantial evidence. We resolve all evidentiary conflicts and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of the trial court\u2019s decision, and may overturn the trial court\u2019s factual findings only if the evidence is insufficient as a matter of law to sustain them. <em>(Lake v. Reed, supra, </em>16 Cal.4th at p. 457.) However, where the determinative issue is legal rather than factual we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"941\">*941</page-number>exercise our independent judgment. <em>(Manriquez v. Gourley </em>(2003) 105 Cal.App.4th 1227, 1233 [130 Cal.Rptr.2d 209].) \u201cIf the decision of the lower court is right, the judgment or order will be affirmed regardless of the correctness of the grounds on which the court reached its conclusion.\u201d (9 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (5th ed. 2008) Appeal, \u00a7 346, p. 397.)</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">B. <em>The Trial Court\u2019s Factual Findings Are Supported by Substantial Evidence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">1. <em>The City\u2019s Civil Service System</em></p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">The outcome of this case turns on application of the City\u2019s civil service procedures. Article IX, section 900 of the City\u2019s charter provides for a comprehensive civil service system. (Oakland City Charter (Charter), art. IX, \u00a7 900, subd. (a).)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The civil service encompasses \u201call offices and employments in the City government\u201d except for certain positions specifically identified in the Charter as exempt or excepted from the civil service upon the recommendation of the city council, approved by the civil service board (Board). (Charter, art. IX, \u00a7\u00a7 902, subd. (f), 900.)</p>\n<p id=\"b799-8\">The City\u2019s Personnel Manual provides the rules and procedures for administering the civil service system. (Oakland Mun. Code, \u00a7 2.08.040; see also \u00a7\u00a7 2.08.010, 2.08.020.B.) Section 3.02(a) of the Personnel Manual directs that \u201cAll positions in the competitive civil service shall be grouped into classes, and each class shall include those positions sufficiently similar in respect to their duties, functions, and responsibilities so that similar positions may be assigned similar titles and embraced within the same class specifications, so that similar requirements as to training, experience, knowledge, skill, and ability, and same rates of pay are applicable. The purpose of such classification is to provide uniform standards, uniform pay scales and an orderly means of regulating the status of incumbents.\u201d The City personnel director is responsible for preparing and maintaining the classification plan, subject to Board approval. (City, Personnel Manual, \u00a7\u00a7 3.02(b), 3.04(a).) The personnel director may also investigate and recommend changes in the classification of any civil service position where warranted (id., \u00a7 3.04(d)), and affected employees and their unions can appeal such decisions to the Board. <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 3.04(e).) Board approval is required for both new classifications and amendments to existing class specifications. <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7 3.04(b), (c).)</p>\n<p id=\"b800-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"942\">*942</page-number>Rule 9 of the City\u2019s Personnel Manuel regulates treatment of personnel in the event of a layoff. Layoffs are effectuated on a \u201c[cjitywide basis by prescribed classification,\u201d with employees with the least seniority and efficiency points laid off first. (City Personnel Manual, \u00a7 9.01; see <em>id., </em>9.02.) Thus, if an employee in a particular job classification is laid off but has more seniority and efficiency points than another employee in the same job classification working for a different City department, the more senior employee may bump the less senior employee, and the less senior employee will be laid off. <em>(Id., </em>\u00a7\u00a7 9.01, 9.02.)</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">While the Port enjoys an amount of autonomy with respect to many of its functions (Charter, art. VII, \u00a7 706), Port employees, with exceptions not relevant here, are included within the City\u2019s civil service system and subject to its civil service rules. (Charter, art. VII, \u00a7 714.) The Port is also authorized to maintain its own personnel rules provided they are consistent with the City\u2019s civil service rules. (Oakland Mun. Code, \u00a7 2.08.050.)</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">Section 3 of the Port Rules addresses the administration of job classifications, including reclassifications. Section 3.05, subdivision (b) provides: \u201cThe Employee Relations Officer shall have the right to initiate and conduct investigations of any and all positions in the classified service when he or she deems such investigation necessary, and when appropriate, shall request an analysis of the Personnel Director, who shall recommend a change in classification to the Executive Director where the facts are considered to warrant such action. In this connection the Employee Relations Officer and Personnel Director may at any time secure from employees involved new statements of the current duties and responsibilities of positions under consideration. The employees concerned shall have reasonable notice and an opportunity to be heard by the Board before it takes action on a change in classification.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">2. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">The court found that, although the Charter authorizes the Board and the Port to exclude certain positions within the Port from the City\u2019s civil service rules, they had not done so with respect to LaGrone\u2019s position. LaGrone was, therefore, entitled to the protections afforded by the civil service rules during the 2008 layoff. This much is undisputed.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-8\">The question posed here, rather, is whether the Port changed LaGrone\u2019s job classification in 2002 so that his position ceased to be a common classification with the City\u2019s civil engineer positions. The City maintains that the Port\u2019s unilateral renaming of his position as \u201cPort-specific\u201d withdrew the position from the common classification. The court disagreed: \u201cWhile there is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"943\">*943</page-number>some evidence in the record to suggest that the Port treated certain positions, including the Port Associate Engineer, as limited to Port employees, at least in terms of promotional opportunities, this does not establish that the position was excluded from the common classification under the applicable provisions of the Charter, particularly for purposes of layoffs.\u201d Its finding is supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">As a preliminary matter, we reject the City\u2019s assertion the court failed to honor the strong presumption of correctness afforded to agency decisions after administrative hearings. To the contrary, the court correctly cited <em>Fukuda </em>for the standard of review and expressly noted its deference to the hearing officer. Nothing in the record gives us reason to doubt those express statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-6\">On the merits, there is sufficient evidence in the record supporting the trial \u2022 court\u2019s ruling. There was considerable evidence that LaGrone\u2019s position was within a common classification with City engineering jobs. The Port associate engineer classification was created in 1953 and retitled twice, in 1982 and 2002. LaGrone testified that the 2002 title change did not remove him from a common classification, and that the City so indicated in a March 4, 2003 letter sent to verify that LaGrone was \u201cstill interested in remaining on the transfer list.\u201d As LaGrone explained, \u201cyou have to be in the same classification to be on the transfer list.\u201d LaGrone also testified that transfers between City and Port engineering positions were common at the time he applied\u2014he knew \u201ca lot of engineers went to the City and vice versa.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b801-7\">Until Lindheim determined otherwise, the evidence shows both the Port and the City believed LaGrone was entitled to bump into a City engineering position. This is shown by the Port\u2019s letter informing LaGrone of his right to bump into a City position and CEDA\u2019s letter confirming his new position and notifying him when and where to report for work. It was also confirmed by the Port\u2019s outside counsel and by City human resource analyst Pritchett\u2019s testimony. Pritchett testified: \u201cQ: When you, uh, and the Port personnel first discussed the engineering classifications for the layoff in 200\u2014, the Port layoff in 2008, did you, did you initially believe that the Port Associate Engineer and the City Civil Engineer were common classifications? [][] A: Based solely on the comparison of the job descriptions, yes. [][] Q: And taking a look at what, um, has been marked as City Exhibits 1 and 2 for a moment, I\u2019d like to ask you if you\u2019re aware of, why these letters were sent to Mr. LaGrone? [|] A. Yes, I am familiar with these letters. [|] Q: Okay and why were they sent? [f] A: Based on the initial recommendations between the City and the Port, the classifications [were] initially deemed common, [f] Q: Did you later change your understanding about whether these were in fact common classifications? [f] A: Based on direction from the City administrator, yes.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b802-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"944\">*944</page-number>The record also supports the court\u2019s finding that the Port\u2019s unilateral 2002 renaming of LaGrone\u2019s position did not remove it from the common classification. Pritchett testified that the City and Port have historically determined which job classifications will be treated as common for purposes of layoff procedures through a collaborative process, and both must agree before a classification will be deemed common. The City acknowledged in the trial court that \u201cit\u2019s a management decision that both the City management and the Port management get to make.\u201d Pritchett explained that the process involves comparing job descriptions, minimum qualifications and \u201cother certifications.\u201d There was no evidence that the City and Port ever carried out such a comparison, or engaged in any sort of collaboration in connection with the Port\u2019s 2002 renaming of LaGrone\u2019s classification. By its terms, the May 2002 Port ordinance changed only the names of the Port\u2019s engineer positions. It makes no reference to job classifications, duties, responsibilities, qualifications, or pay levels. And while section 3.05 of the Port Rules requires that potentially affected employees be given notice of a proposed classification change before the Board may act on it, LaGrone was never told the 2002 change in his job title affected his classification or that he had the right to dispute it.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-4\">Much of the City\u2019s argument on appeal is aimed at demonstrating that the evidence in the administrative record supports the Board\u2019s four specific findings. We need not address these arguments at length, because the only question posed for this court\u2019s consideration is whether there was substantial evidence to support the trial court\u2019s conclusion. \u201cEven when, as here, the trial court is required to review an administrative decision under the independent judgment standard of review, the standard of review on appeal of the trial court\u2019s determination is <em>the substantial evidence test.\u201d (Fukuda v. City of Angels, supra, </em>20 Cal.4th at p. 824, italics added.) Moreover, of the Board\u2019s four findings, only its determination that \u201c[t]he City and the Port did not mutually agree that appellant\u2019s classification was a city-wide classification\u201d conflicts with the trial court\u2019s factual determination that, at least until the 2008 layoffs came about, they did. As we have explained, the trial court\u2019s determination is amply supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b802-5\">The City argues at great length that the court confused the concept of removing Port positions from the civil service system entirely, as authorized under Charter section 902, subdivision (c), with that of making positions \u201cPort-specific\u201d by removing them from a common classification with City positions. It says the court erroneously assumed \u201cthat the respondent\u2019s \u2018Port specific\u2019 job classification had been improperly excluded from the civil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"945\">*945</page-number>service system in violation of Charter [sjection 902, subdivision (c),\u201d and thus based its order exclusively on Charter section 902, subdivision (c), which it maintains was never raised at the administrative hearing or in the trial court. This argument misconstrues the ruling. The court found that LaGrone\u2019s classification was <em>not </em>excluded from the civil service system. The dispositive issue, as the City seems to agree in its reply brief, was and is whether the Port\u2019s 2002 renaming of LaGrone\u2019s position removed it from its previously accepted common classification with City engineer positions. The court\u2019s finding that it did not is supported by substantial evidence and therefore will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b803-5\">II. <em>Attorney Fees</em></p>\n<p id=\"b803-6\">After he prevailed on the writ petition, LaGrone moved for an award of attorney fees pursuant to section 1021.5, California\u2019s private attorney general statute.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> He contended his case would \u201cultimately confer a significant benefit on the public and a large class of persons\u201d by requiring fair and uniform public employment practices and eradicating illegal employment termination practices \u201cengaged in by Defendants over the last 30 years or more.\u201d The court ruled that LaGrone \u201cha[d] not demonstrated that the action herein resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest, rather than an action to enforce a right and obtain a remedy personal to him,\u201d and therefore denied the motion. We review this ruling for abuse of discretion. <em>(Connerly v. State Personnel Bd. </em>(2006) 37 Cal.4th 1169, 1175 [39 Cal.Rptr.3d 788, 129 P.3d l].)<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b803-7\">Section 1021.5 authorizes an award of fees to a successful party \u201cin any action which has resulted in the enforcement of an important right affecting the public interest if: (a) a significant benefit, whether pecuniary or nonpecuniary, has been conferred on the general public or a large class of persons, (b) the necessity and financial burden of private enforcement, or of enforcement by one public entity against another public entity, are such as to make the award appropriate, and (c) such fees should not in the interest of justice be paid out of the recovery, if any.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b804-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"946\">*946</page-number>LaGrone disputes the trial court\u2019s finding that he failed to show this litigation conferred a benefit upon a large class of people, but that finding was within the court\u2019s discretion. \u201cThe private attorney general theory recognizes citizens frequently have common interests of significant societal importance, but which do not involve any individual\u2019s financial interests to the extent necessary to encourage private litigation to enforce the right. [Citation.] To encourage such suits, attorneys fees are awarded when a significant public benefit is conferred through litigation pursued by one whose personal stake is insufficient to otherwise encourage the action. [Citation.] Section 1021.5 was not designed as a method for rewarding litigants motivated by their own pecuniary interests who only coincidentally protect the public interest.\u201d <em>(Beach Colony II v. California Coastal Com. </em>(1985) 166 Cal.App.3d 106, 114 [212 Cal.Rptr. 485].) \u201cInstead, its purpose is to provide some incentive for the plaintiff who acts as a true private attorney general, prosecuting a lawsuit that enforces an important public right and confers a significant benefit, despite the fact that his or her own financial stake in the outcome would not by itself constitute an adequate incentive to litigate.\u201d <em>(Satrap v. Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co. </em>(1996) 42 Cal.App.4th 72, 80 [49 Cal.Rptr.2d 348]; see also <em>Pacific Legal Foundation </em>v. <em>California Coastal Com. </em>(1982) 33 Cal.3d 158, 167 [188 Cal.Rptr. 104, 655 P.2d 306]; <em>Caloca v. County of San Diego </em>(2002) 102 Cal.App.4th 433, 447 [126 Cal.Rptr.2d 3].)</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">Here, LaGrone\u2019s action was not initiated in the interest of the general public, but instead as an administrative action to reinstate his employment. The possibility that his lawsuit may have conveyed a cautionary message to the City and Port about their conduct, or that it might cause them to change their practices in the future, is insufficient to satisfy the significant public benefit requirement. <em>(Pacific Legal Foundation v. California Coastal Com., supra, </em>33 Cal.3d at p. 167; <em>Flannery v. California Highway Patrol </em>(1998) 61 Cal.App.4th 629, 635-636 [71 Cal.Rptr.2d 632].) The trial court appropriately determined LaGrone did not demonstrate an adequate public, rather than personal, benefit to support an award under section 1021.5.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b805-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"947\">*947</page-number>DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b805-5\">The judgment is affirmed. LaGrone is awarded costs on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"ANK\">McGuiness, P. J., and Poliak, 1, concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-6\">On January 11, 2012, the opinion was modified to read as printed above.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b796-8\"> This written opinion is not in the record, and apparently was never produced.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b797-8\"> Unless otherwise indicated, further statutory references are to the Code of Civil Procedure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b799-9\"> We grant LaGrone\u2019s request for judicial notice of the pertinent sections of the Charter.

The court ruled there was no basis for a fee award under that provision, and LaGrone has not challenged that ruling on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b803-9\"> LaGrone asserts we should apply the de novo standard of review, citing <em>Connerly. </em>Not so. <em>Connerly </em>observes that, while the normal standard of review for an attorneys\u2019 fees award is abuse of discretion, \u201c \u2018de novo review of such a trial court order is warranted where the determination of whether the criteria for an award of attorney fees and costs in this context have been satisfied amounts to statutory construction and a question of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Connerly </em>v. <em>State Personnel Bd., supra, </em>37 Cal.4th at p. 1175.) This is not such a case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b804-5\"> We previously deferred ruling on requests by both parties for this court to take additional evidence pursuant to section 909. We grant such requests only under exceptional circumstances that justify deviating from the general rule that appellate review is limited to the record before the lower court. <em>(Vons Companies, Inc. v. Seabest Foods, Inc. </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 434, 444, fn. 3 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 899, 926 P.2d 1085].) No such exceptional circumstances are present here. Accordingly, the requests are denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-6\">The City alternatively asks us to take judicial notice of postjudgment revisions to its Personnel Manual apparently made in 2011, which it argues prove the Port associate engineer classification is not a common class with the City civil engineer classification. In effect, the City seeks to have these alleged changes considered as postjudgment evidence. The request, whether styled as one for new evidence or judicial notice, is also denied.
