As explained below, we affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-12\">In the published portion of the opinion, we hold that the one-year statute of limitations in Code of Civil Procedure section 340, subdivision (c), for an action \u201cby a depositor against a bank for the payment of a forged or raised check\u201d is not applicable to this case. Appellant\u2019s action relates to Wells Fargo\u2019s alleged payment of a forged check drawn on her home equity line of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>credit. With respect to this account, Appellant is not a \u201cdepositor.\u201d The trial court erred when it sustained Wells Fargo\u2019s demurrer to three causes of action in the second amended complaint, based on its conclusion that these causes of action are barred by the statute of limitations in Code of Civil Procedure section 340, subdivision (c).</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">On August 26, 2008, Appellant filed this action against Wells Fargo.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On August 5, 2009, she filed a first amended complaint, asserting one cause of action against Wells Fargo for identity theft under Civil Code section 1798.93. This statute provides, in pertinent part, \u201cA person may bring an action against a claimant to establish that the person is a victim of identity theft in connection with the claimant\u2019s claim against that person.\u201d (Civ. Code, \u00a7 1798.93, subd. (a).)</p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">Appellant alleged that someone forged her signature on two checks totaling $99,000 drawn on her home equity line of credit at Wells Fargo. The checks were made out to \u201cLord of the Rings Jewelry,\u201d one dated April 1, 2007, in the amount of $45,000, and one dated April 4, 2007, for $54,000. The checks were cashed. Appellant alleged that she sent Wells Fargo written notice that the checks had been \u201clost and/or stolen along with her identity\u201d and that \u201cher signature [on the checks] was forged.\u201d She asserted that Wells Fargo \u201cfailed to diligently investigate [her] notification of identity theft\u201d and \u201ccontinue[d] to pursue its claim against\u201d her.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">Pursuant to Civil Code section 1798.93, subdivision (c), Appellant sought (1) a declaration that she is not obligated to Wells Fargo for the $99,000 drawn against her home equity line of credit, (2) an injunction restraining Wells Fargo from collecting or attempting to collect on the claim, and (3) damages, attorney fees, costs, a civil penalty and any equitable relief the court deems appropriate against Wells Fargo.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-8\">In the first amended complaint, Appellant also made claims against Lord of the Rings Jewelry (LORJ).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In the second cause of action in her first amended complaint, Appellant alleged that, \u201cOn or about April 3rd and 5th, 2007 [LORJ] and DOES 1 through 10 knowingly and willingly conspired and agreed among themselves to defraud, embezzle, and take $99,000.00 from [Appellant] by cashing the two checks drawn on [Appellant]\u2019s home equity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>line of credit.\u201d Appellant alleged that she had not written or authorized the checks and had not conducted business with LORJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">Appellant also asserted that LORJ had committed general negligence and fraud. She alleged that LORJ \u201cknew or should have known that the two checks were illegally obtained and written.\u201d She also alleged that LORJ \u201cdefrauded [her] in the amount of $99,000.00 by depositing and/or cashing two checks drawn on [Appellant]\u2019s home equity line of credit without [Appellant]\u2019s knowledge and permission . . . .\u201d Appellant sought \u201crecovery of all [her] damages, attorney\u2019s fees and costs and exemplary damage [v/c] from [LORJ].\u201d Appellant did not include Wells Fargo in the claims of conspiracy, general negligence and fraud made in the first amended complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">Wells Fargo filed a demurrer to the first amended complaint on grounds that the action was barred by the statute of limitations. Wells Fargo argued that the statute of limitations applicable to Appellant\u2019s cause of action against Wells Fargo is the one-year statute of limitations in Code of Civil Procedure section 340, subdivision (c), which governs actions \u201cby a depositor against a bank for the payment of a forged or raised check.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 340, subd. (c).) According to the first amended complaint, the checks were cashed on April 3 and 5, 2007. Wells Fargo argued that the statute of limitations began to run on May 5, 2007, at the latest because, within 30 days after the checks were cashed, Appellant would have received a statement showing that the checks had posted to her account. Appellant filed this action against Wells Fargo on August 26, 2008, more than a year later. Wells Fargo argued that Appellant could not avoid the bar of the one-year statute of limitations by labeling her cause of action against Wells Fargo as one for \u201cidentity theft\u201d under Civil Code section 1798.93, and attempting to apply the four-year statute of limitations for identity theft claims set forth in Civil Code section 1798.96.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">Appellant filed an opposition to the demurrer, arguing that the four-year statute of limitations in Civil Code section 1798.96 applied to her identity theft cause of action against Wells Fargo. Appellant did not dispute Wells Fargo\u2019s contention that she became aware of the alleged wrongful conduct in May 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">On December 31, 2009, the trial court heard oral argument on Wells Fargo\u2019s demurrer to the first amended complaint. The court concluded that the statute of limitations applicable to Appellant\u2019s cause of action against Wells Fargo is the one-year statute of limitations in Code of Civil Procedure section 340, subdivision (c), and found that Appellant\u2019s claim against Wells <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>Fargo, as pleaded in the first amended complaint, was barred by that statute of limitations. The court also found, however, that \u201cit is conceivable that [Appellant] may plead facts that may toll the statute of limitations.\u201d Accordingly, the court sustained the demurrer with leave to amend.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">In its written tentative ruling, which the court adopted as the final ruling, the court explained: \u201cThe delayed discovery rule prevents accrual of a cause of action for statute of limitations purposes until the plaintiff discovers or should have discovered the negligent cause of his or her injury. It is noted, however, that [Appellant] states in her Opposition that she \u2018became aware of the fraud on or around May of 2007.\u2019 [Citation.] If this is true, then [Appellant]\u2019s claim would clearly be time barred by CCP \u00a7 340(c), thereby deeming leave to amend fruitless. However, in the interest of justice, the Court would sustain with leave to amend to provide plaintiff an opportunity to attempt to cure the defect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b196-5\">At oral argument, counsel for Wells Fargo informed the trial court that Appellant\u2019s counsel had indicated that Appellant intended to amend the complaint to \u201cadd a different theory, as opposed to merely asserting the same theory, just with a different set of facts.\u201d The court stated that it was only granting Appellant leave to amend \u201cto plead around the [statute of limitations] defect.\u201d The court instructed Appellant that if she wanted to allege a new theory of recovery against Wells Fargo, then she needed to file a motion for leave to amend her complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">On January 21, 2010, Appellant filed a second amended complaint. In addition to the cause of action for identity theft, Appellant asserted seven additional causes of action against Wells Fargo which were not included in the first amended complaint: civil conspiracy, negligence, breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, bad faith, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and violation of Business and Professions Code section 17200.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellant did not seek leave of court before adding these new causes of action against Wells Fargo.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-7\">Appellant included new factual allegations in her first cause of action for identity theft. She alleged that Wells Fargo \u201callowed third person[s] to access and/or obtain HELOC [(home equity line of credit)] checks tied to [Appellant]\u2019s account and then allowed those checks to be negotiated through LORJ which had accomplished this same misdeed previously through checks obtained from [Wells Fargo] HELOC checks <em>[sic] </em>for different customers.\u201d Appellant further alleged that she had \u201cnever ordered nor received HELOC checks,\u201d but checks \u201cwent directly from [Wells Fargo] to the persons who perpetrated this crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>Appellant claimed that Wells Fargo \u201chad a custom and practice in place that allowed information to be leaked out . . . and for checks to be sent out without [Appellant]\u2019s permission and then allowed same to be negotiated despite the LORJ being involved with two other HELOC accounts].\u201d Appellant also claimed that Wells Fargo \u201cemployees negligently misappropriated and transmitted [Appellant\u2019s personal information to unknown persons\u201d and that Wells Fargo \u201cnegligently hired, supervised, managed and/or permitted their employees to access, obtain, utilize or do as otherwise set forth [in the second amended complaint] all to the detriment of [Appellant].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">Appellant attached to her second amended complaint copies of (1) the May 5, 2007 written notification her attorney sent to Wells Fargo, asserting that she had been the victim of identity theft, (2) the two checks made out to LORJ, dated April 1 and 3, 2007, and (3) a police report, dated April 30, 2007, regarding the alleged identity theft.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">Wells Fargo filed a motion to strike the second through eighth causes of action in the second amended complaint on grounds that Appellant failed to seek leave of court before asserting these seven new causes of action. Wells Fargo argued that the new causes of action \u201cwere not crafted to respond to the Court\u2019s concerns regarding the statute of limitations. Rather, they narrate a wholly new, and implausible, version of events which deviates markedly from the theories underlying the [first amended complaint].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">Wells Fargo also filed a demurrer to the second amended complaint. Wells Fargo argued that the first cause of action for identity theft, the third cause of action for negligence and the fourth cause of action for breach of contract are barred by the one-year statute of limitations in Code of Civil Procedure section 340, subdivision (c). Wells Fargo argued that the other causes of action in the second amended complaint fail to state a claim for reasons that are not at issue on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">Appellant filed an opposition to the demurrer arguing that her action is governed by the four-year statute of limitations for identity theft claims set forth in Civil Code section 1798.96. She pointed out that the wrongful conduct alleged in her second amended complaint is not limited to Wells Fargo\u2019s payment of forged checks, the only conduct covered by the statute of limitations in Code of Civil Procedure section 340, subdivision (c). She accused Wells Fargo of causing her identity to be stolen by sending blank checks drawn on her HELOC (home equity line of credit) account to persons <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>not authorized to access that account. She also argued, among other things, that she was not required to seek leave of court to assert \u201c[a]ny additional causes of action arising from the same set of facts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">On March 23, 2010, the trial court heard oral argument on Wells Fargo\u2019s motion to strike and demurrer to the second amended complaint. The court denied in part and granted in part Wells Fargo\u2019s motion to strike portions of the second amended complaint. In its written ruling, the court explained: \u201cPlaintiff\u2019s third (negligence) and fourth (breach of contract) causes of action can be construed to respond to the Court\u2019s sustaining of demurrer to the first amended complaint. The court sustained the demurrer to the first amended complaint on the grounds that Plaintiff\u2019s identity theft cause of action was barred by the statute of limitations. Plaintiff attempts to plead alternative theories to the Plaintiff\u2019s identity theft claim which may have a different statute of limitations period and relate directly to the same primary rights. However, plaintiff\u2019s second (conspiracy), fifth (breach of fiduciary duty), sixth (bad faith), seventh (breach of the implied covenant of good faith), and eighth (violation of business and professions code [yzc]) causes of action are entirely new and do not respond to the Court\u2019s sustaining of the demurrer to the First Amended Complaint. Accordingly, the second, fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth causes of action are not drawn in conformity with the law and the court\u2019s prior ruling. The Motion to strike the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth causes of action is GRANTED.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">At the hearing, Appellant\u2019s counsel requested permission to file a motion for leave to amend the complaint to add a cause of action for violation of Business and Professions Code section 17200. The court declined the request.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">The trial court also sustained the demurrer to the first cause of action for identity theft, the third cause of action for negligence and the fourth cause of action for breach of contract without leave to amend on grounds that these causes of action are barred by the one-year statute of limitations in Code of Civil Procedure section 340, subdivision (c). The court found the demurrer to the other causes of action to be moot because it granted the motion to strike these causes of action.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">On April 26, 2010, the trial court issued a signed order granting Wells Fargo\u2019s motion to strike portions of the second amended complaint, sustaining without leave to amend Wells Fargo\u2019s demurrer to the remainder of the second amended complaint, and dismissing Wells Fargo from the action. Appellant filed a timely appeal from this order of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">1. <em>Demurrer</em></p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">In reviewing the trial court\u2019s order sustaining the demurrer, \u201cwe examine the complaint de novo.\u201d <em>(McCall v. PacifiCare of Cal., Inc. </em>(2001) 25 Cal.4th 412, 415 [106 Cal.Rptr.2d 271, 21 P.3d 1189].) \u201cWe give the complaint a reasonable interpretation, reading it as a whole and its parts in their context. [Citation.] Further, we treat the demurrer as admitting all material facts properly pleaded, but do not assume the truth of contentions, deductions or conclusions of law. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(City of Dinuba v. County of Tulare </em>(2007) 41 Cal.4th 859, 865 [62 Cal.Rptr.3d 614, 161 P.3d 1168].) \u201c \u2018We also consider matters which may be judicially noticed.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Blank </em>v. <em>Kirwan </em>(1985) 39 Cal.3d 311, 318 [216 Cal.Rptr. 718, 703 P.2d 58].) We must construe the allegations liberally, \u201cwith a view to substantial justice between the parties.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7 452.)</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Wells Fargo demurred to the first cause of action for identity theft, the third cause of action for negligence and the fourth cause of action for breach of contract in Appellant\u2019s second amended complaint on the sole ground that these causes of action are barred by the one-year statute of limitations in Code of Civil Procedure section 340, subdivision (c)<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for an action \u201cby a depositor against a bank for the payment of a forged or raised check.\u201d Both below and on appeal, Appellant argued that the trial court erred in sustaining the demurrer on statute of limitations grounds because her allegations against Wells Fargo are not limited to the payment of forged checks, but also include claims that Wells Fargo caused her identity to be stolen by sending checks she did not order to persons who were not authorized to write checks on her HELOC account.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">After Appellant filed her reply brief on appeal we requested that the parties brief additional issues, including the issue of whether Appellant is a \u201cdepositor\u201d within the meaning of section 340, subdivision (c), with respect to her HELOC account at Wells Fargo, the only account at issue in this action.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In her letter brief, Appellant argued that she is a loan customer on her HELOC account, not a depositor. In its letter brief, Wells Fargo argued that a bank customer who maintains any type of account, including a HELOC account, is a depositor within the meaning of section 340, subdivision (c). For the reasons discussed below, we agree with Appellant that she is not a depositor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>for purposes of this action. Therefore, section 340, subdivision (c), is inapplicable to her causes of action against Wells Fargo.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">We independently review issues of statutory interpretation. <em>(Pineda v. Williams-Sonoma Stores, Inc. </em>(2011) 51 Cal.4th 524, 529 [120 Cal.Rptr.3d 531, 246 P.3d 612].) \u201c \u2018In construing statutes, we must determine and effectuate legislative intent.\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018To ascertain intent, we look first to the words of the statutes\u2019 [citation], \u2018giving them their usual and ordinary meaning\u2019 [citation]. If there is no ambiguity in the language of the statute, \u2018then the Legislature is presumed to have meant what it said, and the plain meaning of the language governs.\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018Where the statute is clear, courts will not \u201cinterpret away clear language in favor of an ambiguity that does not exist.\u201d [Citation.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Lennane v. Franchise Tax Bd. </em>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 263, 268 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 563, 885 P.2d 976].)</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">Section 340 lists numerous types of civil actions which have a one-year statute of limitations. Subdivision (c) of section 340 provides that a one-year limitations period applies to: \u201cAn action for libel, slander, false imprisonment, seduction of a person below the age of legal consent, <em>or by a depositor against a bank for the payment of a forged or raised check, </em>or a check that bears a forged or unauthorized endorsement, or against any person who boards or feeds an animal or fowl or who engages in the practice of veterinary medicine as defined in Section 4826 of the Business and Professions Code, for that person\u2019s neglect resulting in injury or death to an animal or fowl in the course of boarding or feeding the animal or fowl or in the course of the practice of veterinary medicine on that animal or fowl.\u201d (Italics added.) The language in subdivision (c) which is at issue here, italicized above, was added to section 340 in 1905. (Historical and Statutory Notes, 13C West\u2019s Ann. Code Civ. Proc. (2006 ed.) foil. \u00a7 340, p. 78.)</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">Appellant\u2019s HELOC account at Wells Fargo is the only bank account that is involved in this action.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This is a loan account, based on equity in Appellant\u2019s home, not a deposit account. In opening this account, Appellant secured a line of credit which she may borrow against. Appellant did not deposit funds (or anything else) into this account. When a check is written on Appellant\u2019s HELOC account and paid by Wells Fargo, the balance on Appellant\u2019s loan increases. Appellant is a borrower and Wells Fargo is the creditor.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>The language in section 340, subdivision (c), which is at issue here is clear and unambiguous. It applies to an action \u201cby a depositor against a bank for the payment of a forged or raised check.\u201d (\u00a7 340, subd. (c).) Wells Fargo urges this court to presume that the statute also applies to an action by a borrower, rather than a depositor, against a bank for the payment of a forged or raised check. There is no valid basis for such a presumption. If the Legislature wanted this statute to be applicable to all bank customers who maintain any type of account (deposit or credit), the Legislature could have amended the statute by changing the word \u201cdepositor\u201d to \u201ccustomer\u201d or \u201caccount holder.\u201d The Legislature has not chosen to do so. We will not construe this statute more broadly than the plain meaning of the language allows.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">In its letter brief, Wells Fargo argues that section 340, subdivision (c), should be \u201charmonize[d]\u201d with provisions of the California Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) which use the term \u201ccustomer.\u201d We recognize that \u201cstatutes or statutory sections relating to the same subject must be harmonized, both internally and with each other, to the extent possible.\u201d <em>(Dyna-Med, Inc. </em>v. <em>Fair Employment &amp; Housing Com. </em>(1987) 43 Cal.3d 1379, 1387 [241 Cal.Rptr. 67, 743 P.2d 1323].)</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">Wells Fargo cites California Uniform Commercial Code section 4406, enacted in 1963, which provides in pertinent part that where a bank \u201csends or makes available to a customer a statement of account showing payment of items for the account\u201d (\u00a7 4406, subd. (a)), \u201ca customer who does not within one year after the statement or items are made available to the customer . . . discover and report the customer\u2019s unauthorized signature on or any alteration on the item is precluded from asserting against the bank the unauthorized signature or alteration\u201d (\u00a7 4406, subd. (f), citation omitted). For purposes of California Uniform Commercial Code section 4406, the term \u201c \u2018Account\u2019 means any deposit or credit account with a bank, including a demand, time, savings, passbook, share draft, or like account, other than an account evidenced by a certificate of deposit\u201d; \u201c \u2018Customer\u2019 means a person having an account with a bank or for whom a bank has agreed to collect items, including a bank that maintains an account at another bank\u201d; and \u201c \u2018Item\u2019 means an instrument or a promise or order to pay money handled by a bank for collection or payment. . . .\u201d (Cal. U. Com. Code, \u00a7 4104, subd. (a)(1), (5) &amp; (9).)</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">California Uniform Commercial Code section 4406 is not part of the same statutory scheme as Code of Civil Procedure section 340. California Uniform Commercial Code section 4406 is not a statute of limitation. It \u201cis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>an issue-preclusion statute.\u201d <em>(Roy Supply, Inc. v. Wells Fargo Bank </em>(1995) 39 Cal.App.4th 1051, 1065 [46 Cal.Rptr.2d 309].) It requires a bank customer to notify the bank within a year if the bank customer wants to sue the bank regarding a forged item, ensuring that the bank will face liability only if the bank receives prompt notice of the forged item. There appears to be no dispute here that Appellant notified Wells Fargo of the alleged forgeries within about a month of Wells Fargo\u2019s payment of the two checks totaling $99,000. As set forth above, Appellant attached to her second amended complaint a May 5, 2007 letter from her counsel to Wells Fargo confirming her earlier report of identity theft regarding the alleged forged checks. She also attached copies of the checks, which are dated April 1 and 3, 2007, and a copy of a police report, dated April 30, 2007, regarding the alleged identity theft. Appellant alleges that Wells Fargo paid the checks on or about April 9, 2007. By giving Wells Fargo prompt notice of the alleged forged checks, Appellant complied with California Uniform Commercial Code section 4406, subdivision (f), and allowed Wells Fargo to investigate the matter without delay.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">Despite use of the more broad terms \u201ccustomer\u201d and \u201caccount\u201d in California Uniform Commercial Code section 4406, the California Legislature has chosen not to amend section 340, subdivision (c), to make the one-year statute of limitations applicable to an action by any customer or account holder against a bank for the payment of a forged or raised check. As plainly written, section 340, subdivision (c), applies only to an action brought by a \u201cdepositor.\u201d  With respect to her HELOC account, Appellant is not a \u201cdepositor.\u201d The one-year statute of limitations in section 340, subdivision (c), therefore is not applicable to this action. The trial court erred in sustaining the demurrer to Appellant\u2019s first, third and fourth causes of action in the second amended complaint on this ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">2. <em>Motion to </em>Strike<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">DISPOSITION</p>\n<p id=\"b202-7\">The order sustaining the demurrer to the first, third and fourth causes of action in the second amended complaint without leave to amend is reversed. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>The order granting the motion to strike is reversed as to the eighth cause of action for violation of Business and Professions Code section 17200 only.

Appellant does not dispute this date.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b194-10\"> LORJ is not a party to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b196-8\"> LORJ was still named as a defendant in the civil conspiracy and negligence causes of action. Appellant dropped her cause of action for fraud against LORJ.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b199-8\"> Further statutory references are to the Code of Civil Procedure unless otherwise indicated.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b199-9\"> Because we conclude that this first issue is dispositive, we need not discuss the other issue we asked the parties to brief.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b200-7\"> In her second amended complaint, Appellant alleges that she maintains other accounts at Wells Fargo. Those other unidentified accounts are not at issue in this action and are not relevant to this statute of limitations inquiry.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b202-8\">See footnote, <em>ante, </em>page 195.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
