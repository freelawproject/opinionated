The indictment arose from a 1997 incident wherein Tait possessed a pistol. Count One charged Tait with being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). Count Two charged Tait with possessing a firearm in a gun-free school zone in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(q)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b1388-26\">Tait filed a motion to dismiss both counts, claiming that exceptions to both <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1321\">*1321</page-number>\u00a7 922(g)(1) and \u00a7 922(q)(2)(A) made his possession of the pistol legal. The district court granted Tait\u2019s motion to dismiss both counts, based on the court\u2019s interpretation and application of relevant statutes. The government appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal. This court reviews <em>de novo </em>dismissals based on statutory interpretation. <em>Williams v. Homestake Mortgage Co., </em>968 F.2d 1137, 1139 (11th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-5\">We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-7\">At the time of Tait\u2019s alleged violations, Tait had three prior felony convictions in the state of Michigan: a 1958 conviction for the crime of Utter &amp; Publish; a 1962 conviction for Attempted Larceny from a Motor Vehicle; and a 1968 conviction for Enter Without Breaking. Each conviction was punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year. In March, 1997, the Escambia County, Alabama Sheriffs Department issued Tait a pistol license. On November 3, 1997, the Atmore, Alabama Police Department arrested Tait after he allegedly placed a fully-loaded gun against a student\u2019s neck while on Escam-bia County High School property. The two-count indictment against Tait followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-8\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-9\">\n<em>Count One: Violation of \u00a7 922(g)(1)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-10\">The grand jury\u2019s first count against Tait charges a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). This section makes it \u201cunlawful for any person who has been convicted in any court of a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\u201d to possess a firearm in or affecting commerce or to receive a firearm which has been shipped or transported in interstate commerce. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). Tait\u2019s felony record, consisting of three separate crimes each punishable by more than one year imprisonment, brings him within the ambit of the \u00a7 922(g)(1) prohibition against possessing firearms. However, \u00a7 922(g)(1) has a pertinent exception. Section 921(a)(20) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1389-13\">What constitutes a conviction of [a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year] shall be determined in accordance with the law of the jurisdiction in which the proceedings were held. Any conviction which has been expunged, or set aside or for which a person has been pardoned or has had civil rights restored shall not be considered a conviction for purposes of this chapter, unless such pardon, expungement, or restoration of civil rights expressly provides that the person may not ship, transport, possess, or receive firearms.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1389-14\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(20).</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-15\">The first sentence of \u00a7 921(a)(20) makes clear- that Michigan law \u2014 the state of Tait\u2019s convictions \u2014 dictates whether Tait\u2019s felonies constitute convictions under \u00a7 922(g)(1). The second sentence of \u00a7 921(a)(20) provides the exception to \u00a7 922(g)(1): a conviction will not count as a conviction for purposes of \u00a7 922(g)(1) if, <em>inter alia, </em>the state of conviction (Michigan) restores civil rights to the person previously convicted. Tait argues that he did not violate \u00a7 922(g)(1) because his civil rights were restored under Michigan law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1389-16\">The district court determined that Michigan does restore civil rights to persons previously convicted, and that Tait\u2019s civil rights were so restored. The district court was without the benefit of a recent Sixth Circuit case, <em>Hampton v. United States, </em>191 F.3d 695 (6th Cir.1999) when it rendered its decision in this case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Hampton </em>unequivocally confirms the district court\u2019s conclusion that Michigan restores all civil rights to convicted felons. The <em>Hampton </em>court determined that Michigan restores civil rights by operation of law (as opposed to granting certificates or otherwise memorializing the restoration). <em>See id. </em>at 702. <em>Hampton </em>relied on <em>United States v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1322\">*1322</page-number><em>Bolton, </em>32 F.Supp.2d 461 (S.D.Texas 1999), in reaching its decision. The <em>Bolton </em>court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1390-4\">[T]his Court finds that Michigan law provides for the automatic reinstatement of all civil rights of convicted felons following release from custody and completion of probation. Thus, once [the defendant] completed his sentence ..., all or essentially all of [his] civil rights\u2014 namely, his right to vote, to hold public office, and to serve on a jury \u2014 were \u201crestored automatically by the force of the very [Michigan] laws that suspended] them.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1390-5\"><em>United States v. Bolton, </em>32 F.Supp.2d at 465 (quoting <em>United States v. Dahms, </em>938 F.2d 131, 134 (9th Cir.1991)).</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-6\">Thus, under <em>Hampton, </em>Tait\u2019s civil rights were restored. This conclusion does not, however, automatically qualify Tait for the exemption in \u00a7 921(a)(20). Section 921(a)(20) contains an \u201cunless\u201d clause: the restoration of civil rights exempts a convicted felon from the prohibition against possessing a firearm <em>\u201cunless </em>such ... restoration of civil rights expressly provides that the person may not ... possess ... firearms.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(20). The Supreme Court discussed this \u201cunless\u201d clause at length in <em>Caron v. United States, 524 </em>U.S. 308, 118 S.Ct. 2007, 141 L.Ed.2d 303 (1998). <em>Caron </em>involved a Massachusetts statute which prohibited felons from possessing handguns, but which did not prohibit felons from possessing rifles. The issue in <em>Caron </em>was whether the state prohibition against felons possessing some weapons, but not all, triggered the unless clause. <em>See id. </em>at 2011. The Court held that the prohibition did trigger the unless clause. The Court essentially held the unless clause is \u201call-or-nothing;\u201d either state law triggers the clause by banning felons from possessing some firearms, or state law does not trigger the clause because the state does not ban felons from possessing any firearms. <em>See id. </em>Since Massachusetts had deemed felons unfit to possess some weapons, the statutory unless clause had been triggered (and therefore felons in Massachusetts do not qualify for the \u00a7 921(a)(20) exception). If Massachusetts had remained silent on the issue, the unless clause would not have been triggered.</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-10\">Michigan, like Massachusetts, grants restoration of civil rights by operation of law. As such, Tait received no written restoration of civil rights which could have expressed any limitations on those rights. Rather, these limitations would also be found in Michigan law. The government contends that section 750.224\u00cd of the Michigan Code provides the limitation in Tait\u2019s case. The section prohibits persons convicted of \u201cspecified felonies\u201d from possessing firearms.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 750.224\u00cd (1999). A \u201cspecified felony\u201d is a felony in which:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1390-11\">An element of that felony is the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another, or that by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1390-12\">Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 750.224f(6)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b1390-13\">The government contends that one of Tait\u2019s crimes, Attempted Larceny from a Motor Vehicle, should be considered a specified felony.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1323\">*1323</page-number>that Tait\u2019s attempted larceny from a motor vehicle conviction did not qualify as a specified felony. Whether attempted larceny from a motor vehicle is a specified felony turns on whether the crime involves a substantial risk of physical force, or the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force as an element of the crime. The district court, finding no Michigan law which defines physical force, determined that \u201ca logical interpretation of the larceny from motor vehicles statute would be that physical force is not required.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Absent an element of physical force, larceny from motor vehicles would not be a specified felony. Consequently, the conviction would not trigger the unless clause under <em>Caron, </em>and the restoration of Tait\u2019s civil rights would qualify for the \u00a7 921(a)(20) exception. Therefore, we hold that Tait\u2019s civil rights were unreservedly restored to him by operation of Michigan law, and Tait was not subject to prosecution under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). The district court properly dismissed Count One of the indictment against Tait.</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-5\">\n<em>Count Two: Violation of \u00a7 922(q)(2)(A)</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-6\">The grand jury\u2019s second count against Tait charges him with a violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(q)(2)(A) (the \u201cGun-Free School Zone Act\u201d). The section states, \u201cIt shall be unlawful for any individual knowingly to possess a firearm that has moved in or that otherwise affects interstate or foreign commerce at a place that the individual knows, or has reasonable cause to believe, is a school zone.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(q)(2)(A). Tait was on high school property, an obvious \u201cschool zone,\u201d at the time of his alleged criminal conduct. However, as with \u00a7 922(g)(1), an exception to the firearms prohibition of \u00a7 922(q)(2)(A) applies. Section 922(q)(2)(B)(ii) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1391-10\">Subparagraph (A) does not apply to the possession of a firearm ... if the individual possessing the firearm is licensed to do so by the State in which the school zone is located or a political subdivision of the State, and the law of the State or political subdivision requires that, before an individual obtains such a license, the law enforcement authorities of the State or political subdivision verify that the individual is qualified under law to receive the license....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1391-11\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(q)(2)(B)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b1391-12\">The Gun-Free School Zone Act dictates that Tait violated federal law via possessing a handgun in a school zone <em>unless </em>Tait was licensed by Aabama, <em>and </em>either Aa-bama or Escambia County verified that Tait was qualified to receive the license.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As Tait did possess a handgun in a school zone, and Tait was licensed in Aabama, the issue boils down to whether Aabama or Escambia County adequately verified that Tait was qualified to receive the license.</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1324\">*1324</page-number>Alabama\u2019s licensing requirements are lenient:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1392-4\">The sheriff of a county may, upon application of any person residing in that county, issue a qualified or unlimited license to such person to carry a pistol ... if it appears that the applicant has good reason to fear injury to his person or property or has any other proper reason for carrying a pistol, and that he is a suitable person to be so licensed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ak5m\">Ala.Code \u00a7 13A-11-75 (1975). The government argues that Tait\u2019s license is void for purposes of \u00a7 922(q)(2)(B)(ii) for two reasons: first, because Alabama\u2019s requirements for verifying an applicants\u2019 qualifications are too relaxed to ever qualify their licensees for \u00a7 922(q)(2)(B)(ii) protections; and second, because Tait was not a suitable person to be licensed under Alabama law. According to the government, these licensing deficiencies resulted in Tait receiving a void license which did not qualify for the exception in \u00a7 922(q)(2)(B)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b1392-5\">The government first argues that Alabama licenses never qualify for the exception in \u00a7 922(q)(2)(B)(ii) because Alabama does not require its licensing agents to conduct background checks on firearms license applicants. The \u00a7 922(q)(2)(B)(ii) exception only applies if \u201c... the law of the State ... requires that ... [the sheriff] verify that the individual is qualified under law to receive the license.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(q)(2)(B)(ii). By its basic terms, the statute merely requires that the Alabama sheriff ensured that Tait was qualified <em>under Alabama law </em>to receive the license. While the Alabama law is extremely lenient, it is nonetheless the only pertinent law. Alabama has chosen its laws, and these are the laws which determine whether the federal statute\u2019s exception applies. <em>See Caron v. United States, </em>524 U.S. 308, 118 S.Ct. at 2011-12, 141 L.Ed.2d 303.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Alabama is free to set forth its own licensing requirements, and Congress chose to defer to those licensing requirements when it established \u201cqualified under law\u201d as its criterion for the exception to the Gun-Free School Zone Act. Therefore the government\u2019s first argument with respect to \u00a7 922(q)(2)(B)(ii) is rejected.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1392-9\">The government next argues that Tait failed to qualify for an Alabama license, even under Alabama\u2019s lax standards, because Tait was not a suitable licensee. The government maintains that Tait was not suitable based on Alabama Code section 13A-ll-72(a), which provides: \u201cNo person who has been convicted in this state or elsewhere of committing or attempting to commit a crime of violence shall own a pistol or have one in his ... possession or under his ... control.\u201d Ala. Code \u00a7 13A-ll-72(a) (1975). The government\u2019s argument fails due to a recent Eleventh Circuit opinion, <em>United States v. Fowler, </em>198 F.3d 808 (11th Cir.1999). The <em>Fowler </em>court held, \u201cWithout an express limitation on the certificate restoring civil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1325\">*1325</page-number>and political rights ..., under Alabama law the restoration of civil and political rights restores the firearm rights limited by \u00a7 13A-ll-72(a).\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1393-4\">The government tries to distinguish <em>Fowler </em>on two bases: first, that the defendant in <em>Fowler </em>received a written pardon restoring his civil rights (whereas Tait\u2019s civil rights were restored via operation of Michigan law); and second, that the <em>Fowler </em>case involved the interpretation of \u00a7 922(g) rather than \u00a7 922(q). Both distinctions are irrelevant. First, the Supreme Court held, in <em>Caron, </em>\u201cMassachusetts restored petitioner\u2019s civil rights by operation of law rather than by pardon or the like. This fact makes no difference.\u201d <em>Caron, </em>524 U.S. 308, 118 S.Ct. at 2011, 141 L.Ed.2d 303. The critical issue is <em>whether </em>civil rights were restored unconditionally\u2014 not <em>hoto </em>the civil rights were restored. Tait\u2019s civil rights were restored, without reservation; thus Tait is entitled to the same protections as any other person without state-imposed limitations on his civil rights \u2014 including the protections of the \u00a7 922(q)(2)(B)(ii) exception.</p>\n<p id=\"b1393-5\">As for the government\u2019s second point, the fact that this court was evaluating \u00a7 922(g) rather than \u00a7 922(q) in <em>Fowler </em>is entirely irrelevant. Utilizing <em>Fowler\u2019s </em>line of reasoning, this court holds that Tait\u2019s firearms rights were restored for purposes of exceptions to \u00a7 922(g) as well as \u00a7 922(q). <em>Fowler </em>held that a felon\u2019s right to firearms was completely restored for purposes of removing \u00a7 13A-ll-72(a) limitations. <em>Fowler, </em>198 F.3d 808. Tait\u2019s suitability for firearms licensing was equally restored. To hold otherwise would be non-congruous with <em>Fowler. </em>We therefore hold that the district court properly dismissed Count Two of the indictment against Tait.</p>\n<p id=\"b1393-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1393-7\">Wiley Block Tait, a former felon, possessed a firearm in a gun-free school zone. Under some circumstances, these facts would have subjected Tait to prosecution under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922. However, Tait violated neither 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) nor 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(q)(2)(A) in this instance, because both sections have exceptions which legalized Tait\u2019s possession. Therefore, the district court\u2019s order is</p>\n<p id=\"b1393-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1389-11\">. The state of Michigan is part of the Sixth Circuit. Thus <em>Hampton v. United States </em>is persuasive on this issue until and unless the Michigan Supreme Court rules otherwise. <em>See Hampton, </em>191 F.3d at 702.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1390-7\">. Section 750.224f contains exceptions, as well as its own restoration conditions, which are not relevant to this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1390-8\">. Specified felonies also include felonies which specifically involve controlled substances, firearms, or explosives, as well as the felonies of burglary of an occupied dwelling, breaking and entering an occupied dwelling, and arson. <em>See </em>Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 750.224f(6)(ii)-(v). The district court aptly concluded that by separating out burglary of an occupied dwelling and breaking and entering an occupied dwelling, Michigan legislators intended that burglary of a non-occupied dwelling and breaking and entering of a non-occupied dwelling should not themselves be considered specified felonies. Hence, attempted larceny from a motor vehicle (being akin to burglary or breaking and entering of a non-occupied dwelling) likewise would not be a specified felony.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1391-7\">. The Michigan statute defining larceny at the time of Tait\u2019s conviction in 1962 provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1391-8\">Any person who shall commit the offense of larceny by stealing or unlawfully removing or taking any wheel, tire, radio, heater or clock in or on any motor vehicle, house trailer, trailer or semi-trailer, shall be guilty of a felony, punishable by a fine not to exceed $1,000.00, or by imprisonment in the state prison not more than 5 years. Any person who shall enter or break into any motor vehicle, house trailer, trailer or semi-trailer, for the purpose of stealing or unlawfully removing therefrom any goods, chattels or property of the value of not less than $5000.00, or who shall break or enter into any motor vehicle, house trailer, trailer or semi-trailer, for the purpose of stealing or unlawfully removing therefrom any goods, chattels or property regardless of the value thereof if in so doing such person breaks, tears, cuts or otherwise damages any part of such motor vehicle, house trailer, trailer or semi-trailer, shall be guilty of a felony, punishable by a fine not to exceed $1,000.00, or by imprisonment in the state prison not more than 5 years.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AS5\">Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 750.356a (1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b1391-15\">. Tait argued to the district court and on appeal that the Gun-Free School Zone Act is unconstitutional under <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>514 U.S. 549, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995). The district court determined that it \"need not reach the constitutionality issue because Tait\u2019s permit removes him from the reach of \u00a7 922(qj.\u201d This court declines to entertain Tait\u2019s constitutional argument for the same reason.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b1392-6\">. The <em>Caron </em>court noted, in the context of a discussion of \u00a7 922(g), that state laws provide the source of law for determining restoration issues, as well as for determining whether a former felon is too dangerous to possess a firearm. In other words, federal law. uses state findings to determine whether the federal law has been violated. <em>See Caron, </em>524 U.S. 308, 118 S.Ct. at 2011-12, 141 L.Ed.2d 303.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b1392-7\">. The government argues that Alabama\u2019s licensing requirements are so relaxed that they will always fail to qualify their licensees for the \u00a7 922(q)(2)(B)(ii) exception. The government maintains that Congress envisioned a background check when drafting the exception. This would require states to check for prior felonies before issuing firearms licenses. If the state failed to do so, their licenses would be valid for state purposes, but the licensees would not garner the \u00a7 922(q)(2)(B)(ii) protections. While the government\u2019s argument is persuasive, it misses the point. Tait\u2019s civil rights were fully restored by operation of Michigan law; hence, even if Alabama had conducted a background check, Tait would have qualified for the license so long as Alabama allowed former felons to possess firearms. Whether Tait qualified for a license under Alabama laws is discussed later in this opinion. Having determined that Alabama\u2019s licensing procedure is not relevant to this appeal, we decline to decide whether, in general, Alabama's licensing procedure qualifies its licensees for \u00a7 922(q)(2)(B)(ii) protections.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
