The receipt does not constitute an <em>agreement </em>between the company and the shipper'. It is <em>only </em>a receipt, with <em>notice </em>of the terms on which the company is willing to undertake the transportation of the goods (De Barre <em>v. </em>Livingston, 48 <em>Barb., </em>511; Belger <em>r. </em>Dinsmore, 34 <em>Blow. Pr., </em>421). (1.) The common law liability of a common carrier can only be abridged by <em>express contract. </em>(2.) <em>Notice </em>of a restricted liability, however distinct, though brought home to the actual knowledge of the shipper, is not sufficient\u2014is not evidence of the shipper\u2019s assent\u2014nor can a special agreement be inferred therefrom (Hollister <em>v. </em>Nowlen, 19 <em>Wend., </em>234; Nevins <em>v. </em>Bay State Co., 4 <em>Bosw., </em>225 ; Rawson <em>v. </em>Railroad Co., 2 <em>Abb.

D. Smith, </em>138). Whenever a carrier has \"been released from liability by the terms of a receipt or bill of lading, the evidence has shown \u201c a special contract limiting his liability <em>at time of </em>acceptance,\u201d or \u201ca notice brought home to the knowledge of the owner of the goods <em>at the time, </em>or <em>before the delivery </em>of the goods, and assented to by him\u201d <em>(Redf. on Railways, </em>2 ed., 270 ; cases <em>supra; </em>Moriarty <em>v. </em>Harden\u2019s Express, 1 <em>Daly, </em>227; Moore <em>v. </em>Evans, 14 <em>Barb., </em>524).</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AEqW\">II. There was no such agreement between the Union Ex- \u2019 press Co. and the plaintiffs in this case, nor can an agreement be implied. The receipt was not issued to plaintiff\u2019s agent until June 27, <em>two days </em>after delivery of the goods, and probably after they had been sent forward from Cincinnati.</p>\n<p data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AFI_\">III. The only agreement made by the plaintiffs for the carriage of the oil was made with the Union Company. To that the defendants are not parties. It was not made by their agent, nor by their authority, nor for their benefit, except as hereafter stated ; nor does the case show that it came to their possession, or that they had knowledge of it, at any time prior to the commencement of this suit. The Union Company was not the defendant\u2019s agent in procuring this oil for transportation, or in contracting with the plaintiffs in reference to it. It was the plaintiffs\u2019 agent, entrusted with the plaintiffs\u2019 goods, and undertaking to deliver those goods safely at Hew York (New Jersey Navigation Co. <em>v. </em>Merchant\u2019s Bank, 6 <em>How. U S., </em>344; Stoddard <em>v. </em>Long Island R. R. Co., 5 <em>Sandf., </em>180). The Union Company <em>might have </em>bound the plaintiffs by a special contract with defendants ; but no such contract was made. The bill of lading was only intended to define the nature, the terms, and the liabilities of the Union Company\" s agency.</p>\n<p data-order=\"29\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ATS\">IV. A receipt, bill of lading, or notice, is construed <em>strictly </em>against the\" carrier, and <em>liberally </em>in favor of the shipper; and exceptions are to be taken most strongly against the party for whose benefit they are introduced (Curtis, J., in Avery <em>v. </em>Merrill, 2 <em>Curt., </em>11). The language <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>must be taken most strongly against the defendants. The instrument was drawn up with care, in language selected by themselves, and the restrictions were for their benefit, The owners of packages sent by express rarely have an opportunity to examine the terms of the receipt presented to them (Sawyer, J., in Hooper v. Wells, <em>5 Am. Law Reg. N. S., </em>23, citing Ch. J. Gibson, in Atwood v. Trans. Co., 9 <em>Watts, </em>88).</p>\n<p data-order=\"30\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ao_\">V. These general principles aid the construction of this bill. (1.) A carrier may contract to transport goods beyond the terminus of his own route. (2.) He may stipulate for a restricted liability for <em>himself, </em>and leave the common law liability of connecting carriers unaffected. (3.) Or he may provide that the qualified liability shall extend to the connecting carriers. (4.) Or that it shall extend to some, fully, or to all, partially, etc.</p>\n<p data-order=\"31\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AMA1\">VI. This bill of lading contains whatever agreement was made by the plaintiffs. It expresses the conditions limiting the liability of the Union Company. It assumes the necessity of the use of \u201c connecting lines,\u201d and specifies to what extent the general liability of such \u201cconnecting lines\u201d shall be qualified. (1.) <em>All </em>the conditions and exemptions are made applicable to the Union Company. (2.) Those that relate to loss or damage in transit, are <em>confined </em>to the Union Company in express terms. (3.) A receipt for the oil, in \u201cgood order,\u201d shall discharge the \u201cconnecting lines\u201d from liability for \u201cdeficiency in packages.\u201d If liable for loss, they \u201c shall have the benefit of any insurance\u201d upon the property destroyed. No further stipulation in their behalf was asked for by the Union Company, or assented to by the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p data-order=\"32\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AcB\">VII. If the bill of lading had provided that its several provisions should extend to any party who might undertake the carriage of the oil over any portion of the route, the only question would be\u2014Is the loss within any of the exceptions <em>% </em>Or, if it had referred to the Union Company alone, and been silent as to other carriers, it would have afforded a plausible argument in favor of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>these defendants. But the terms of the agreement are explicit. The Union Company shall not he liable for leakage, delay, collision or lire. The defendants shall not, in a certain event, be liable for deficiency, and, in case of loss, shall be entitled to insurance held by plaintiffs. Why was <em>special provision </em>made for the defendants\u2019 indemnity in these <em>two particulars, </em>if <em>all </em>the stipulations of the agreement were intended to\u2019 be for their benefit and protection <em>% Expr\u00e9s sio unius, </em>&lt;\u00a3c. \u201c Where parties have entered into written agreements with express stipulations, the presumption is, that having expressed <em>some, </em>they have expressed <em>all </em>the conditions by which they intend to be bound under that instrument\u201d <em>(Broom's </em>Maxims, 582, <em>marg.).</em></p>\n<p data-order=\"33\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b318-5\">was of the Union Company only, and intended to be limited to it. It was an Express Company\u2014running over various routes,\u2014owning its own cars, but wholly dependent for motive power upon the companies over whose roads it operated. Its. cars could move only as and when <em>those </em>carriers chose to move them. Its freight was deposited in places which. <em>those </em>carriers'provided or selected. The time consumed-\u2014the means employed\u2014the dangers incurred in the use of those means\u2014in the transit of freight, were alike beyond its regulation or control. Collision and fire were perils to which it was apt to be exposed by the mismanagement or neglect of other parties. It is not strange, therefore, that the Union Company should contract for <em>its own </em>exemption from liability as Insurers against casualties, which, though not inevitable, it could not even <em>attempt </em>to prevent. And it is significant, that the exemption from loss by fire is -limited to places where the merchandise would be <em>least </em>under the control of the employees of the Union Company, and most exposed to danger.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"34\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b318-6\"><em>Charles F. Sanford,.for </em>the defendants, respondents.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"35\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ArA\">I. The bill of lading, issued by the Union Transportation and Insurance Company <em>constituted a special contract, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number><em>by the terms and conditions of which both parties thereto were bound in law. </em>(1.) A carrier may, \"by <em>special </em>agreement, secure exemption from liability not arising from his own fraud, or culpable negligence (Harris <em>v. </em>Packwood, 3 <em>Taunt., </em>264; N. J. Steam Nav. Co. <em>v. </em>Merchant\u2019s Bank, 6 <em>How. U.

In all the cases where the questions involved have arisen upon a bill of lading, issued by the carrier, and <em>accepted by the shipper, concurrently with the delivery of the goods, </em>such bill of lading has been held to constitute a special contract between carrier and shipper. See Great N. R. Co. <em>v. </em>Morville (21 <em>L. J. R., Q. B., </em>319); York, &amp;c. R. Co. <em>v. </em>Crisp (14 <em>C. B. R., </em>527). The stipulation of the parties, and the findings of the court, recognize and establish <em>the fad of an </em>\u201c <em>agreement contained in said bill of </em>lading.\u2019\u2019</p>\n<p data-order=\"36\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Aep0\">II. The Union Transportation and Insurance Company undertook the transportation of the plaintiffs\u2019 merchandise <em>from the place of shipment to the place where consigned. </em>(1.) The terms of the contract are explicit; and it is admitted that the carrier undertook the tr.msportatation of the plaintiffs\u2019 merchandise from Cincinnati to New York. (2.) The contract contains a charge for the carriage of the merchandise to New Yook. And wherever a carrier agrees to a rate of charge (whether payable at the beginning or end of the journey), for which the goods are to be transported to a particular place, he is, in law, held <em>as undertaking the carriage of the goods to, and as responsible (subject to the restriction contained in the contract), for their safe delivery at, the place so designated </em>(Weed <em>v. </em>Saratoga and Schenectady R.

Nor is it always easy to ascertain clearly the relations sustained by the connecting companies with each other with reference to the business.</p>\n<p id=\"A10\">To these difficulties is added another,\u2014that of the uncertain state of the law in reference to the liability of connecting carriers. The following cases will illustrate the course of decision upon this subject in England and in this country, and may be profitably referred to in connection with the authorities cited in the case in our text. It will be observed that they are not harmonious. Each is fully stated, and the jurisdiction in which it was determined is mentioned, in order that the practitioner may compare it with the others, and give due weight to the different mies laid down.</p>\n<p id=\"Az7\">A carrier who takes into his care a parcel directed to a particular place, and does not by positive agreement limit his reponsibility to a part, only of the distance, undertakes <em>prima facie </em>to carry the parcel to its destination; and the rule is not varied by the fact that the place is beyond the limit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>within which the carrier professes to carry. Thus, where a parcel was delivered at Lancaster, to the Lancaster &amp; Preston Railway Company, directed to a person at aplace in Derbyshire, and the person who carried it to the station offered to pay the transportation, but the book-keeper said it had . better be paid by the person to whom it was directed, on the receipt of it, and the parcel was lost after it was forwarded from Preston, where the L. &amp; P. railway connected with other <em>lines;\u2014Held, </em>that the railway company that first received the parcel from the owner were liable for its loss <em>(Exch., </em>1841, Muschamp <em>v. </em>Lancaster &amp; Preston Junction Railway Co., 8 <em>Mees. &amp; </em>W., 411).</p>\n<p id=\"A1X\">[This case of Muschamp is the leading <em>English </em>case on the subject. It holds the receiving carrier to a stricter responsibility than most of the American cases do; but some of the recent decisions in our courts show an inclination to adopt the principle, there laid down, rather than those usually applied by the American courts.]</p>\n<p id=\"AEv\">If carriers receive a package to carry to a particular place, whether they themselves carry it all the way or not, they must be said to have the conveying of it to the end of the journey, and the other parties to whom they may hand it over are their agents, and the company are clearly liable, unless the facts show that their responsibility has determined. Their not having taken the amount of the carriage is immaterial, if explained by the fact of their notknowing what that amount would be <em>(Q. B., </em>1851, Watson <em>v. </em>Ambergate, Nottingham &amp; Boston Rw. Co., 3 <em>Eng. Law &amp; Eq., </em>497; 15 <em>Jur., </em>448).</p>\n<p id=\"A--v\">The rule that railway companies who receive goods and book them for a certain destination, are carriers throughout the entire route, has been extended in England to common carriers who carry from a place within to a place without the realm. The rule that one holding himself out as a carrier between two termini is hound to carry, within reasonable limits, all goods tendered to him, applies, though one of the termini is a place out of the realm <em>(C. P., </em>1854, Crouch <em>v. </em>London &amp; Northwestern R. R. Co., 25 <em>Eng. L. &amp; Eq., </em>287 ; 14 <em>C. B., </em>255; 23 <em>Law J. N. S., </em>73 ; 18 <em>Jur., </em>148; 2 <em>Com. Law R., </em>188).</p>\n<p id=\"AxA\">If a carrier contracts to carry goods to, and deliver them at, a particular place, his duty at that place is precisely the same, whether his own conveyance goes the entire way, or stops short at an intermediate place, and the goods are conveyed by another carrier; and the carrier, or his clerk, at the place of destination, is the agent of the original carrier for all purposes connected with the conveyance and delivery and dealing with the goods, as his own clerk would have been at the place where his own conveyance stops <em>(Exch., </em>1857, Crouch <em>v. </em>Great Western Railway, 29 <em>Law Times, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>354; distinguishing Collins <em>v. </em>Bristol &amp; Exeter Railway Co., <em>Exch., </em>1 <em>H. &amp; N.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"ABa\">Where a company give a receipt for goods, specifying they are to bo delivered at a point beyond their own terminus, on the route of another road, on presentation of the receipt, they are liable for a loss beyond their terminus <em>(S. C. Ct. of Appeals, </em>1857, Kyle <em>v. </em>Laurens Railroad Co., 10 <em>Rich. Law, </em>382).</p>\n<p id=\"AWC\">Although the power of a railroad company to make a contract for the transportation of persons or property beyond their own lines is not expressly granted by the act of incorporation, it may be conferred by implication, as necessary to the proper and profitable excercise of the power, specifically enumerated in the charter <em>(Me.

It also enables a company to bind itself by a special contract for the delivery of goods within a limited time, at a place on a connecting route, in another State (N. <em>Y.

In regard to matters not altogether beyond the general objects of their incorporation, and which, upon a liberal construction, may fairly be considered as embraced within them, it is not competent for the company to adopt the acts of their agents and officers so long as they prove beneficial, and, when they prove otherwise, shield themselves from responsibility, by resorting to a more limited and literal construction of their corporate powers <em>(Vt.

If they forward the goods with way-bills that are substantially sufficient, they are not liable for a misappropriation of the goods by some of the connecting companies <em>(Mass.

On the arrival of the goods at Albany the proprietor of the P. line refused to receive <em>them; </em>and <em>the </em>carrier forwarded them by a freight barge, on board which they were <em>lost.\u2014Held, </em>that the carrier was liable for the loss. On the refusal of the steamboat proprietors to receive the property, the carrier should cither have communicated the fact to the plaintiff, and awaited further instructions, -or should have relieved himself from liability by depositing the goods for safe-keeping in a suitable warehouse. The facts in this case disclosed no such emergency as warranted the carrier in deviating from his instructions on the ground that the safety of the property required it. <em>lb.</em></p>\n<p id=\"A6yA\">A receipt note specifying the station to which the goods are to be carried, with notice printed thereon that the company will not be responsible for loss, &amp;c., of goods forwarded by them, beyond their termini, by other carriers, amounts to a contract to carry to the station specified only, although the owner of the goods, at the time of taking the receipt note, writes in pencil the address of the consignee, which is at a place beyond the company\u2019s terminus <em>(Exch., </em>1853, Fowles <em>v. </em>Great Western R.

But where the one of such companies receiving the goods, had advertised that all the roads had made a joint arrangement for transportation over their lines, and that a duplicate receipt must be taken and forwarded to the agent of the connecting road, in order to fix responsibility upon that company; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number><em>\u2014Held, </em>that under these circumstances a joint contract between the companies might be inferred, and one of them was liable for a loss which did not occur upon its road <em>(S.

It applies only to the company originally receiving and undertaking to convey the goods (N. <em>Y. Supreme Ct., </em>1864, Smith <em>v. </em>N. Y. Central R. R.

It is well understood by the public that the through ticket in such a case is only for convenience of payment, and that the passenger is to look to each line as the carrier on its own road. It might be otherwise where a participation in profits or joint control is shown <em>(Conn. Supreme Ct, </em>1852, Hood <em>v. </em>N. Y. &amp; New Haven R. R.

It was carried- over the defendants\u2019. railroad to South Amboy, and there put on board a steamboat owned by the defendants, in the usual course of business, and by such vessel carried to New York, and stored in the freight house of said defendants, on Sunday evening, July 10th, and between that and the morning of the 11th of the same month, the said freight house and the said oil were destroyed by fire, without any negligence on the part of the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-5\">No notice of the arrival of said property was given to the plaintiff before the destruction thereof by said fire.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-6\">If this action was against the Union Company, it is quite clear that no recovery could be had \"against it, as this property was, within the exception of the contract, destroyed while in a depot awaiting delivery to the owner. The liability of the carrier was not terminated at the time of the fire. No notice of the arrival of the property had been given ; and until that was done the responsibility of the carrier continued.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-7\">This being so, the question is whether the defendant was liable for the loss \u2019 of the property as carrier, wholly irrespective of the contract with the Union Company. The contract with the Union Company provided for the transportation of the oil from Cincinnati to New . York, and until the expiration of a reasonable time for its removal after notice to the owner of its arrival. The defendant is not liable on that contract. ' It was not a party to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b321-8\">Upon what principle then, is it liable ?</p>\n<p id=\"b321-9\">It is said that being a common carrier, and receiving the property as such, to be carried, the law authorizes the owner to elect to pursue it, instead of the company with which the .contract was made. . Such a proposition should rest upon the clearest principles or the highest authority. No case has been cited, nor can one be found, establishing any such proposition.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>The defendant received the goods from the Union Company to be carried, under its contract with the owner, and it was entitled to the benefit of all stipulations in such contract affecting its liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-5\">As the Union Company would not, on the facts proved, be liable for the property, neither would the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-6\">The judgment must therefore be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b322-7\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b320-9\">Present, Ingraham, P.
