The referee reported in favor of the plaintiff for the value, at Harper\u2019s Ferry, of the goods so demanded, with interest. Judgment was entered on the report accordingly, with costs. From this judgment the defendants appealed to the general term of the superior court, in which the action was brought, who reversed the judgment, and ordered a new trial, on the ground that the evidence amounted to a variance, leaving the cause of action unproved in its entire scope and meaning.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"19\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b75-7\">The decision of the court is reported in 4 <em>Bob., 672.</em></summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b75-8\">From their ord\u00f3r the plaintiffs now appealed to the court of appeals.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b75-9\"><em>Torrance &amp; Spaulding, </em>for the plaintiff, appellant;</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Av4D\">\u2014cited Belknap <em>v. </em>Sealey, 14 <em>N.

Neglect to forward the goods from Harper\u2019s Ferry to Washington; and (2.) Negligence and improper care of the goods at Harper\u2019s Ferry, whereby the goods were destroyed,\u2014then the plaintiff entirely failed to prove his case, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>referee erred in not dismissing the complaint. There was not a particle of proof of any neglect of duty at Harper\u2019s Ferry, or -of any request or agreement to carry the goods from Harper\u2019s Ferry to Washington. The complaint remained unproved in its entire scope and meaning, and, under section 171 of the Code, the complaint should have been dismissed for a failure of proof. The referee has rendered judgment, not for a refusal to forward, nor for neglect of the care of the goods at Harper\u2019s Ferry, both of which charges were based upon contract, but <em>ex delicto, </em>for a conversion of some of the goods at Sandy Hook. This he could not properly do (Bailey <em>v. </em>Ryder, 10 <em>N. Y., </em>363; <em>Voorhies' Code, </em>\u00a7 171, and cases cited in notes; Saltus <em>v. </em>Genin, 3 <em>Bosw., </em>250 ; Whitcomb <em>v. </em>Hungerford, 42 <em>Barb., </em>177 ; Cowenhoven <em>v. </em>City of Brooklyn, 38 <em>Id., </em>9 ; Gaspar <em>v. </em>Adams, 28 <em>Id., </em>441). The case was not one of a simple variance, nor one authorizing an amendment, or a conformation of the complaint to the facts proved. There was an entire failure of proof, and the plaintiff should have been nonsuited. .But, if the case was one of variance, an amendment should not have been allowed without putting the plaintiff to his motion, because the variance was material, and misled the defendant. To spring a trap upon the defendant in a final report, without giving him an opportunity to show how he had been misled, was not according to the defendant his legal rights. He came to try the allegations of his neglect at Harper\u2019s Ferry, and his neglect to transport the goods from Harper\u2019s Ferry to Washington. He did not come prepared to try the question of his conversion of the goods at Sandy Hook. Ho such issue was made. He was invited to no such repast. He had not fortified himself with evidence as to what transpired at Sandy Hook. Under the circumstances of the case, there is warrant for saying, that if the complaint had been for the conversion of the goods at Sandy Hook, the defendant could have proved that Cantwell, who demanded the goods at that place, assented to the reasonableness of the demand for the receipts, and promised to procure them, and assented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>to the retention of the goods until the receipts were produced. This suggestion is supported \"by the fact that Cantwell sent for the receipts, and they were forwarded to him. If he promised to procure the receipts, and assented to the retention of the goods until the receipts were produced, then the detention of the goods at Sandy Hook was not a conversion. The defendant was misled by the complaint into believing that no such proof would be required, and hence did not attempt to provide it. Hiving judgment against him, therefore, upon the ground of a conversion at Sandy Hook, was giving judgment against him upon a cause of action as to which he had no opportunity to defend himself; and the judgment, should, for that reason, be reversed.</p>\n<p data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b77-5\">II. There was no conversion of the goods at Sandy Hook. Cantwell was the agent of the shippers, and had no interest in the goods.</p>\n<p data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b77-6\">III. The referee erred as to the measure of damages. The proper rule is, to give such damages only as will put the owner <em>in statu quo. </em>There are various portions of the evidence tending to show a violation of this rule:</p>\n<p data-order=\"27\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b77-7\">IV. The damages on the other two shipments should be reduced.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"28\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b77-8\">Scrugham, J.</author>\n<p id=\"A8B\">\u2014The gravamen of the action is the loss of the property through the negligence of the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-9\">The agent of the plaintiff\u2019s assignor had the right to demand and receive it, when he applied for it at Sandy Hook; the property was not then <em>in </em>transitu, but had reached its destination, as the contract was to convey it to Harper\u2019s Ferry, or to the defendant\u2019s agency nearest or most convenient to it. Such was Sandy Hook, and the goods could not at that time be taken farther by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-10\">The agent of the plaintiff\u2019s assignor was authorized by the defendant\u2019s agent at Harper\u2019s Ferry to apply for the goods at Sandy Hook.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-11\">The refusal to deliver them was wrongful, and its re-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>suit was their loss. The wrong would not have been committed but for the negligence of defendant in not sending a proper way-bill.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">The box of candies was delivered, by mistake of defendant\u2019s agent, to the wrong persons, and lost to plaintiff\u2019s assignor.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">There can be no doubt of this being attributable to defendant\u2019 s negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-7\">It was not claimed on the trial that the case proved varied from that pleaded ; nor was any of the evidence objected to on the ground that it did not correspond with the allegations of the complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-8\">If that objection had then been taken, the referee might have permitted an amendment of the complaint, and if the defendant alleged surprise, might have imposed terms to prevent it. It was late for the defendant to be surprised after report.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-9\">The order granting a new trial should be reversed, and the judgment entered on report of referee affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-10\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
