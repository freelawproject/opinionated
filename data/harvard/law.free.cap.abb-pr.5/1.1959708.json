No creditor can individually maintain an action against an individual stockholder, for the share so illegally distributed to him; the liability is to the creditors generally, and the action should be commenced by some party representing all the creditors.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b15-11\">In such action it is proper for the receiver to join as defendants any creditors who have instituted such suits, and those who threaten to do so, for the purpose of protecting the stockholders from a multiplicity of actions.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b16-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>Appeal from a judgment on demurrer.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b16-5\">This was an action in which Gr. A. Osgood and Cyrus Curtiss, receivers of the Columbian Insurance Company, were plaintiffs (and respondents), and William Laytin, and many others, were defendants (and appellants). The action was brought for the purpose of recovering back dividends which the defendants, as stockholders, had received out of the capital, and of restraining creditors from prosecuting individual actions for the same purpose.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b16-6\">The Columbian Insurance Company was organized as an insurance company by virtue of of the general act authorizing the organization of such companies.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b16-7\">The company was dissolved by the judgment of the supreme court in February, 1863, and the plaintiffs were subsequently appointed receivers, as successors o'f the receivers originally appointed. The plaintiffs duly qualified, and gave the requisite security. In July, 1866, the company, being insolvent, paid a dividend of three and one-half per cent, upon its stock to the defendants, who were stockholders of the company. Some of the defendants, who were creditors of the company, commenced actions individually against several of the stockholders separately, for the purpose of recovering from them the amount of the dividend received by them respectively. Whereupon the plaintiffs commenced this action against all the stockholders of the company who had received dividends, and also against the creditors of the company who had commenced actions against the stockholders, demanding judgment against the stockholders severally for the amount of the dividends respectively received, and a judgment against the creditors, perpetually restraining them against the prosecution of suits against the stockholders of the company for the collection of the dividends received.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b16-8\">'The complaint was in the following form :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b17-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>[Title of the cause.]</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"14\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b17-5\">\u201cThe plaintiff's complain and allege :</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b17-6\">\u201cI.

The receivers cannot recover, unless upon the ground that as trustees they represent the entire body of creditors. (1.) A receiver is an officer appointed by the court to administer the assets of a legally incompetent corporation <em>(Smith on Rec.; </em>Hutchinson <em>v. </em>Massarene, <em>2 Ball &amp; Beatty, </em>55 ; Davis <em>v. </em>Malborough, 2 <em>Swanst., </em>118; Curtis <em>v. Leavitt, 15 N. Y., </em>9). <em>(2.) </em>He is a trustee of the common interests of all the claimants, and must administer impartially those assets which he is bound by law to collect <em>(In re </em>Burke, 1 <em>Ball &amp; Beatty, </em>74). (3.) He alone is empowered by statute to collect assets of the corporation improperly disposed of <em>(Laws of </em>1858, <em>506, </em>ch. 314, \u00a7 2; 3 <em>Rev. Stat., </em>5 ed., 226; Talmage <em>v. </em>Pell, 7 <em>N. Y. </em>[3 <em>Seld.], </em>328 ; Pentz <em>v. </em>Hawley, 1 <em>Barb. Ch., 122 ; </em>Nathan <em>v. </em>Whitlock, 9 <em>Paige, 152). </em>(4.) And the receivers are by them appointment invested with all rights previously possessed by individual claimants <em>(Edw. on Rec., </em>141-2, and cases there <em>cited; </em>Rankine <em>v. </em>Elliott, 16 <em>N. Y., </em>377; affirming S. C., 14 <em>How. Pr., </em>339). (5.) Hence, if the creditors had no legal right to enforce individual claims against the stockholders, no individual rights became merged by their appointment in the receivers.</p>\n<p data-order=\"37\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b20-10\">II. The creditors had no legal right to bring separate actions against individual stockholders. (1.) The section of the act under which the individu d suits were brought by the several creditors, provides as follows: \u201cHo dividend shall ever be made by any company incorporated under this act, when its capital stock is impaired, or when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"7\">*7</page-number>the making of sucli dividend will have the effect of impairing its capital stock; and any -dividend so made shall subject each of the stockholders receiving the same to an individual liability to the creditors of said company, to the extent of such dividend received by him\u201d <em>(Laws of </em>1849, ch. 308, \u00a7 20 ; as amended by 1 <em>Laws of </em>1857, ch. 38, \u00a7 1; 4 <em>Edm. Stat. at </em>L., 210, \u00a7 20). (2.) The object of this section is to provide a remedy for the creditors of a company when solvent, and prevent the improper dividend of assets. (3.) It confers no right on any one creditor to sue'a stockholder. The latter is liable to the whole body of creditors, and hence any proceeding must be made in their collective name. (4.) And the section referred to, inasmuch as it indicts a penalty, is to be construed strictly, by the well known rule as to penal statutes. (5.) And the cases seemingly <em>contra </em>have either been overruled, or else are decisions in cases of corporations organized under other statutes (Hyde v. Lynde, 4 <em>N. Y. </em>[4 <em>Comst.] </em>387, superseded by <em>Laws of </em>1858, ch. 314; 3 <em>Rev. Stat., </em>5 ed. <em>226; </em>Butterworth <em>v. </em>O\u2019Brien, 39 <em>Barb., </em>192 ; S. C., 24 <em>How. Pr., </em>438, cited and explained, case following).</p>\n<p data-order=\"38\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b21-6\">III. The receivers are not entitled, by virtue of their general powers as trustees, to recover these so-called dividends. (1.) The act under which this company was organized required the payment of the capital as a condition precedent to the transaction of business. (2.) By the terms of the statute, if the profits accruing are insufficient to liquidate the obligations contracted, the creditors have a right of resort to the capital of the company. (8.) Hence, as the stockholders are only entitled by the statute to the net profits, any division which compels a resort to the capital in order to discharge the obligations of the company, is strictly forbidden. (4.) Now the act of 18-49, in such cases, authorizes the creditors (where no receiver is appointed) to recover the dividends so paid (4 <em>Edm. Stat. at L., </em>210, \u00a7 20). (5.) But that section contemplated only legal dividends, and did not create a right of action for pretended dividends appropriated from the capital stock (1 Edm. <em>Stat, at L., </em>548; 1 <em>Rev. Stat., </em>590, \u00a7 4. See <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>1 <em>Rev. Stat., </em>589, \u00a71, as to what is \u201ca dividend'\u2019). (G.) Therefore, as, according to the eleventh section of the complaint, the dividend was paid out of the capital, it was concedeclly a misappropriation, and should have been sued for as such. (7.) And the specific objection here made is, that the complaint alleges that this so-called dividend was paid out of the capital stock, and yet seeks to recover as a dividend that which by its own showing was not a dividend.</p>\n<p data-order=\"39\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"b22-6\">IV. Nor can this complaint be sustained under the provisions of the statute authorizing receivers to recover the proceeds of the trust fund misapplied. (1.) No distinct averment of fraud ajrpears in this complaint in sup- . port of such an action and recovery <em>(Laws </em>of 1858, 506, ch. 314, \u00a7 2 ; 3 <em>Rev. Stat., </em>5 ed., 226). (2.) Nor does it even appear that the directors who misapplied the funds have been proceeded against to no purpose, or are parties to this action. And <em>non constat </em>but they are entirely responsible (Curson <em>v. </em>African Co., <em>Skinner, </em>184). (3.) So that, though fraud must be alleged and proven, and it cannot be presumed, the complaint contains no allegation that \"this property was improperly disposed of,\u201d\u2014 which was assumed to be the case in the court below.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"40\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b22-8\">Grover, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AOH\">\u2014The point presented.by the stockholders who have demurred is, that the plaintiffs cannot recover from them the sums received as dividends, for the reason that the complaint shows that the same was paid out of capital, and not out of the profits, and is not therefore a dividend within the meaning of the law, but a misappropriation of capita], and does not therefore come within the meaning of the statute. I am at a loss to discover liow the argument that money paid by the company to its stockholders, although paid as a dividend, is not such, in a legal sense, if sound, can at all benefit these defendants. <em>Laws of </em>1858, 506, \u00a7 <em>1, </em>am ng other tilings, provides that the receiver of an insolvent corporation may, for the benefit of creditors, treat as void, and resist all acts done, transfers and agreements made in fraud of the rights of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>any creditor. From tile facts stated in the complaint it is manifest that a distribution of the capital of the company, or any part of it, among the stockholders, was a fraud upon the creditors. It is alleged that the company was at the time insolvent.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-5\">It must be presumed that the directors, at the time of declaring the dividend, were cognizant of this fact, as it was the duty of each to examine into the affairs of the company before making a dividend, and, when making it, to know that it was made from net profits belonging to the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-6\">If the company, being insolvent, distributes its capital among stockholders, thus placing it beyond the reach ox its creditors, such act is a fraud upon the creditors, and falls directly within the provision of the statute above cited. It is insisted by the counsel for the stockholders, that to authorize the plaintiffs to recover, by virtue of the above statute, from the stockholders, the complaint should aver an intent* in making the distiibution, to defraud the creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b23-7\">I do not think this necessary. Ignorance of facts that it was the duty of the managers to know, not to know which was gross negligence, cannot excuse the managers, and impart any virtue or validity to acts otherwise clearly illegal, and which were a palpable fraud upon the creditors. But I do not think the position sound. Section 20 of the act to provide for the incorporation of insurance companies, as amended in 1837 (4 <em>Elm. Rev. Stat., </em>210), provides that \u201cno dividend shall ever be made by any company incorporated under this act, when its capital stock is impaired, or when the making of such dividend will have the effect of impairing its capital stock ; and any dividend so made shall subject each of the stockholders receiving the same to an individual liability to the c.editors of said company, to the extent of such dividend received by him.\u201d This shows that the legislature used the term dividend in its proper sense\u2014that is, a sum of money distributed <em>pro rata </em>among the stockholders, without reference to the source from which it was taken or paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>The fact of its being illegal to make a dividend of anything but net profits does not at all tend to show the meaning of the legislature in the use of the word. The design plainly expressed by the language of the section was to prohibit a dividend of the capital among the stockholders, and to preserve the same intact as a fund for tire payment of creditors and security of dealers. It follows that the dividend in the present case was illegal, and that the stockholders receiving the same are liable to the creditors for the amount by them respectively received. The next question is, how is this to be recovered from the stockholders ? ' Their liability is to the creditors of the company.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-4\">It is clear that no one creditor of the company can maintain an action against an individual stockholder, for the reason that the liability created by statute is to the creditors generally, and not to individual creditors, thus creating a liability to the creditors jointly. Again, a creditor, if permitted individually to sue the separate stockholders, might institute actions against each, although his demand amounted to far less than the aggregate liability, and he would continue a creditor until he had obtained satisfaction of his debt, and could obtain judgment in all the actions. Again, in equity this liability inures to the creditors in proportion to the amount of their debts respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-5\">The maxim \u201cthat equality among creditors is equity,\u201d is applicable to the case. A court of law cannot, in a joint action by all the creditors, work out this equity and do justice between the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-6\">This confers jurisdiction in equity, upon the ground that there is no adequate remedy at law.</p>\n<p id=\"b24-7\">The plaintiffs, as receivers, are trustees for all the creditors, and the appropriate parties to prosecute in their behalf, thus avoiding the troublesome inquiry as to who are creditors in the proceeding, to collect from the stockholders the several amounts each is liable to pay. All the stockholders who are liable may, and should, be included as defendants in the same action. There is no difficulty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>in determining the amount each is to pay, upon the trial of the canse ; and, in case the whole amount of the liability is not required for the payment of the debts of the company, the precise amount each is to pay can be determined in the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-5\">This course of proceeding is also necessary to prevent multiplicity of actions, as there are several hundreds of stockholders.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-6\">The above views dispose of the case as to the stockholders.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-7\">The creditors insist that they are not proper parties to the action against the stockholders, and that upon this ground they are entitled to judgment upon the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-8\">Equity having the power to enforce payment from the stockholders, and an action having been instituted in the proper mode for that purpose, which in its result will place the fund in the possession of the court for distribution among the creditors, it is the duty of the court to protect the stockholders from being harassed by other actions instituted to enforce the same liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-9\">This can only be done by restraining such actions. To enable the court effectually to do this, those creditors who have instituted such suits, and those who threaten so to do, are proper parties to the action. *</p>\n<p id=\"b25-10\">The judgment appealed from should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-11\">All the judges concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b25-12\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
