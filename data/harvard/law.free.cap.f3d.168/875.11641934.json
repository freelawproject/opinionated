In effect, this decision overturned a jury verdict awarding Staneu damages in his anti-retalia<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"877\">*877</page-number>tion claim, pursued against Central Apartment Management, Inc. d/b/a Gables Residential Services (\u201cGables\u201d), under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a). We hold that the conduct Stancu complains of did not constitute an \u201cultimate employment decision.\u201d We therefore affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-4\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">Stancu, along with several other plaintiffs, brought suit against Gables for alleged violations of various state and federal laws. Stan-cu is the only plaintiff to take his case to trial, and he is the only party before us on appeal. Only the claims based on Title VII were actually tried to the jury. In the first claim, Stancu alleged that Gables refused to grant him a lateral transfer to another of the corporation\u2019s locations because of his Romanian heritage. In his second claim, Stancu alleged that Gables denied him the transfer because he had engaged in protected Title VII activities. Specifically, Stancu argued that he had opposed some of Gables\u2019 practices that he claimed were unlawful under Title VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-6\">Only the second claim is at issue in this appeal. The jury returned a verdict for Gables on the first claim. On the second claim, however, the jury returned a verdict for Stancu and awarded him $72,500 in compensatory and punitive damages. The district court then granted Gables\u2019 motion for judgment as a matter of law. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 50. The district court based it decision on its view that a reasonable jury could not have found by a preponderance of the evidence that but for Stancu\u2019s protected activities, Gables would have granted his request for a transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-7\">We review de novo a district court\u2019s decision to grant a motion for judgment as a matter of law. <em>Nichols v. Lewis Grocer, </em>138 F.3d 563, 565 (5th Cir.1998) (citation omitted). To determine whether the district court should have granted the motion, we look to the now-familiar standard articulated in <em>Boeing Co. v. Shipman, </em>411 F.2d 365 (5th Cir.1969) (en banc), overruled on other grounds, <em>Gautreaux v. Scurlock Marine, Inc., </em>107 F.3d 331 (5th Cir.1997) (en banc):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AaVq\">[T]he Court should consider all of the evidence \u2014 not just that evidence which supports the non-mover\u2019s case \u2014 but in the light and with all reasonable inferences most favorable to the party opposed to the motion. If the facts and inferences point so strongly in favor of one party that the Court believes that reasonable men could not arrive at a contrary verdict, granting [judgment as a matter of law] is proper.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AUX\"><em>Boeing, </em>411 F.2d at 374. We proceed to discuss the facts with this standard in mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-12\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b979-13\">Gables is a national corporation that owns and manages apartment complexes. Stancu has been employed by Gables since January 1994. He serves as a maintenance supervisor and, by all accounts, is highly skilled in that position. During the relevant time period, Stancu was assigned to work at the Indian Creek apartment complex in Carrollton, Texas. However, when he heard about a new job opening (within Gables) at the Valley Ranch apartments, he asked his supervisors to reassign him to that location.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-14\">Testimony at trial revealed that Stancu wished to transfer to Valley Ranch for two primary reasons. First, the Valley Ranch apartments are located in Irving, Texas, the same city in which Stancu lived. The distance between home and work is especially important to Stancu because he is often \u201con call,\u201d which means that Staneu\u2019s job required him to travel to work when called upon to deal with emergency situations. Stancu also desired the job transfer because it was apparent that Gables would soon lose its management contract at Indian Creek. Stancu feared that if this happened, he might lose his job.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Other than these two factors, the transfer would have had no material effect on Stancu\u2019s job: the job title of the two jobs was the same, the day-to-day duties were the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"878\">*878</page-number>same, the wages at Indian Creek were as high or higher than Stancu would have earned at Valley Ranch,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and the other benefits did not differ.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">When Stancu first sought the transfer in March 1994, Gables denied his request. In pursuing the lateral transfer, Stancu first had an interview with Janet Martin, who was to-be the property manager at Valley Ranch. According to both Stancu and Martin, the interview went poorly and ended with some disagreement. Undeterred, Stancu procured a meeting with the vice president of operations, Terry Turk. Turk denied the request for a transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">Stancu argued to the jury that the reason Gables denied his request for the transfer was because he had opposed their racially discriminatory practices. After reviewing the evidence, however, the district court concluded that Stancu failed to show a sufficient nexus between any protected activities he might have engaged in and the decision to deny his request for a transfer. Because we have chosen to dispose of this case on other grounds, we need not review the evidence concerning Stancu\u2019s activities. <em>See Mulberry Square Productions, Inc. v. State Farm and Casualty Co., </em>101 F.3d 414, 421 (5th Cir.1996) (recognizing that we may affirm the district court\u2019s judgment for different reasons than the district court relied upon).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b980-7\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b980-8\">Title VII makes it an \u201cunlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate against any of his employees ... because he has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by this sub-chapter ...\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-3(a). From this statutory provision, our precedents have gleaned three elements that a plaintiff must prove in his retaliation claim: (1) the employee has engaged in activity protected by Title VII; (2) the employer took adverse employment action against the employee; and (3) a causal connection exists between that protected activity and the adverse employment action. <em>Mattern v. Eastman Kodak Co., </em>104 F.3d 702, 705 (5th Cir.) (citations omitted), <em>cert. </em>denied,-U.S.-, 118 S.Ct. 336, 139 L.Ed.2d 260 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-14\">Our court has analyzed the \u201cadverse employment action\u201d element in a stricter sense than some other circuits. We have stated that Title VII was only designed to address <em>\u201cultimate </em>employment decisions, not to address every decision made by employers that arguably might have some tangential effect upon those ultimate decisions.\u201d <em>Mattern, </em>104 F.3d at 707 (quoting <em>Dollis v. Rubin, </em>77 F.3d 777, 781-82 (5th Cir.1995) (per curiam))(emphasis added).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201c \u2018Ultimate employment decisions\u2019 include acts \u2018such as hiring, granting leave, discharging, promoting, and compensating.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mattern, </em>104 F.3d at 707 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b980-15\">This understanding grows out of our court\u2019s reading of the term \u201cdiscriminate\u201d as used in \u00a7 2000e-3(a). In interpreting the prohibition against \u201cdiscrimination\u201d as a form of retaliation, we have looked to the previous section (\u00a7 2000e-2(a)) for guidance. Specifically, we decided in <em>Mattem </em>that \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(1) describes conduct that parallels the conduct prohibited by the term \u201cdiscriminate\u201d as used in \u00a7 2000e-3. Section 2000e-2(a)(1) makes it unlawful \u201cto fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual, or otherwise to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions or privileges of employment ...\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(l). In <em>Mattem, </em>we contrasted this prohibitory language with the much less refined prohibitions described in \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(2), and we concluded that the anti-retaliation provision excludes \u201cthe vague harms contemplated in \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(2).\u201d <em>Mattem, </em>104 F.3d at 709. Thus, a retaliation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"879\">*879</page-number>claim cannot be based solely on a defendant\u2019s act of \u201climit[ing]\u201d an employee \u201cin any way which would deprive [that employee] of employment opportunities or otherwise adversely affect his status as an employee.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-2(a)(2). We have read \u00a7 2000e-3(a) \u201cto exclude such vague harms, and to include only ultimate employment decisions.\u201d Matt<em>ern, </em>104 F.3d at 709.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b981-5\">Stancu argues that the denial of his transfer request qualifies as a sufficiently adverse employment action. Although Stancu does not directly address our decision in <em>Mattem, </em>he points to the fact that the procedures for procuring the transfer had some of the trappings of the process typically used to hire new employees. He had what the parties have referred to as an \u201cinterview\u201d with the property manager. Given this process, Stan-cu argues that the denial of his transfer was enough to satisfy the \u201cadverse employment action\u201d element of his anti-retaliation claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b981-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b981-7\">We disagree with Stancu\u2019s argument that the denial of his request for a purely lateral transfer constitutes an \u201cultimate employment action.\u201d As an important preliminary point, we think that the overwhelming evidence before the jury established that the transfer to Valley Ranch would have been a purely lateral transfer for Stancu. The undisputed evidence established that the position at Valley Ranch had the same job title, benefits, duties, and responsibilities as the position that Stancu held at Indian Creek. Furthermore, the uncontroverted evidence also showed that Gables paid a lower wage to the person who did (initially) secure the maintenance supervisor position at Valley Ranch than Gables paid to Stancu. Stancu wanted the transfer because of his underlying desire for a shorter commute to work; this, of course, cannot have any effect on whether we view the transfer as a purely lateral one. <em>See Doe v. Dekalb County Sch. Dist., </em>145 F.3d 1441, 1453 (11th Cir.1998) (ADA case in which the court held that the determination of whether an employee has suffered an adverse employment action is to be made using an objective standard).</p>\n<p id=\"b981-9\">Refusing an employee\u2019s request for a purely lateral transfer does not qualify as an ultimate employment decision. Such a refusal is not akin to acts \u201csuch as hiring, granting leave, discharging, promoting, and compensating.\u201d <em>Dollis, </em>77 F.3d at 782 (citing <em>Page v. Bolger, </em>645 F.2d 227, 233 (4th Cir.1981) (en banc)). Although Stancu may have gone through an interview, the result of that meeting would not have altered Stancu\u2019s status as an employee already hired by Gables. Our view comports with \u201cthe clear trend of authority\u201d in other circuits holding that \u201ca purely lateral transfer is not an adverse employment action.\u201d <em>Dekalb County Sch. Dist., </em>145 F.3d at 1450 (quoting, in part, <em>Ledergerber v. Stangler, </em>122 F.3d 1142, 1144 (8th Cir.1997)) (quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Randlett v. Shalala, </em>118 F.3d 857, 862 (1st Cir.1997) (stating that refusals to transfer are arguably less intrusive than involuntary relocations). Other circuits have been quick to parrot the following passage written by Chief Judge Posner:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b981-10\">Obviously a purely lateral transfer, that is, a transfer that does not involve a demotion in form or substance, cannot rise to the level of a materially adverse employment action. A transfer involving no reduction in pay and no more than a minor change in working conditions will not do, either. Otherwise every trivial personnel action that an irritable, ehip-on-the-shoulder employee did not like would form the basis of a discrimination suit. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, already staggering under an avalanche of filings too heavy for it to cope with, would be crushed, and serious complaints would be lost among the trivial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b981-11\"><em>Williams v. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., </em>85 F.3d 270, 274 (7th Cir.1996); <em>see also Ledergerber, </em>122 F.3d at 1144 (quoting the same); <em>Garber v. New York City Police Dept., </em>No. 97-9191, 1998 WL 514222, at *4 (2d Cir. June 12, 1998) (unpublished opinion) (quoting the same); <em>Dekalb County Sch. Dist., </em>145 F.3d at 1449 (quoting the same); <em>but see Randlett, </em>118 F.3d at 862 (concluding that a refusal to transfer can form the basis for a Title VII <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>anti-retaliation claim when the plaintiff has submitted evidence showing that such transfers for hardship reasons are so customary that they are a \u201cprivileges\u201d of employment).</p>\n<p id=\"b982-4\">Stancu might have argued, but did not, that the transfer he sought was not purely lateral because he thought that the position at Valley Forge would be more secure. After all, Stancu thought it apparent that Gables would soon lose their management contract at Indian Creek. Yet even this argument would fail. As we stated in <em>Mat-tern, </em>\u201cTitle VIPs anti-retaliation provision refers to ultimate employment decisions, and not to an \u2018interlocutory or mediate\u2019 decision which can lead to an ultimate decision.\u201d Mat<em>tern, </em>104 F.3d at 708. Transferring an employee to a less secure (but otherwise similar) position is obviously an \u201cinterlocutory or mediate decision which can lead to an ultimate decision.\u201d Had Gables denied Stancu the transfer and then let him go when the Indian Creek contract expired, Stancu may have had a cognizable anti-retaliation claim. But Stancu did not lose his job, and was in fact transferred to Valley Forge when the Indian Creek contract expired. In sum, no reasonable jury could find by a preponderance of the evidence that Gables made an adverse, ultimate employment decision with regard to Stancu.</p>\n<p id=\"b982-5\">Having decided that Stancu has not met the \u201cadverse employment action\u201d element, we need not address the causation element. Furthermore, Stancu is not entitled to attorney\u2019s fees because he is not a prevailing party under Title VII. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(k). The judgment of the district court is therefore</p>\n<p id=\"b982-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b979-8\">. Eventually, Gables did lose the Indian Creek contract. At or about the time that this happened, Gables transferred Stancu to the Valley Ranch apartments. Because Gables made the transfer after Stancu filed his lawsuit, the motivations for the transfer are not clear. Nevertheless, they are irrelevant for our disposition of this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b980-9\">. Evidence adduced at trial revealed that Stancu was paid $13.93 per hour at Indian Creek while the person filling the maintenance supervisor position at Valley Ranch earned $13.00 per hour.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b980-10\">. The Eleventh Circuit has recently discussed the circuit split surrounding the issue of whether Title VII's protection against retaliatory discrimination extends to only \"ultimate employment decisions.\u201d <em>Wideman v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., </em>141 F.3d 1453, 1456 (11th Cir.1998). We are not alone, but we are in the minority. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
