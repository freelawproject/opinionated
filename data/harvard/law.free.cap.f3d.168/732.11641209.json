SMITH, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b834-26\">Ron Haas appeals a summary judgment in favor of ADVO Systems, Incorporated (\u201cADVO\u201d), on Haas\u2019s claim of age discrimination in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (\u201cADEA\u201d). Because Haas raises a genuine issue of material fact regarding evidence of a nondiscriminatory motive, we reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-27\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b834-28\">Haas submitted an application to ADVO for a Sales Manager position. He interviewed with Craig Rosengarden, ADVO\u2019s Vice President for Sales. The interview lasted eighty minutes, during which Rosengar-den commented that Haas was the \u201cfirst well <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"733\">*733</page-number>qualified candidate that he had met.\u201d Haas then met with Jean Dickson, ADVO\u2019s Human Resource Manager, for another sixty to eighty minutes.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-5\">Haas was called back to ADVO for a second interview, in which Rosengarden told him that he had offered the Sales Manager position to another person who had turned it down, leaving Haas and Marie Barden as the finalists. Rosengarden added that his only concern about hiring Haas was his age.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-6\">About a week later, Haas was invited to meet with Greg Parnell, who was ADVO\u2019s Regional Vice President and the official with ultimate hiring authority over the Sales Manager position. This interview lasted approximately two hours. Shortly thereafter, Dickson informed Haas that he was not hired. The reason given was that Rosengarden felt that the chemistry was better with Barden. At the time, Haas was fifty-four years old, Barden thirty-four.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-8\">This court generally analyzes claims under the ADEA via the burden shifting approach in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973). <em>See Ross v. University of Tex., </em>139 F.3d 521, 525 (5th Cir.1998). The plaintiff must carry the initial burden of establishing a <em>prima facie </em>case of discrimination. <em>McDonnell Douglas, </em>411 U.S. at 802, 93 S.Ct. 1817. Haas has done this by showing that (1) he belongs to a protected class; (2) he applied for and was qualified for a position that was seeking applicants; (3) he was rejected; and (4) following his rejection, another applicant not of the protected class was hired. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b835-9\">Thereafter, the burden shifts to the employer, which must articulate \u201csome legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the employee\u2019s rejection.\u201d <em>Id. </em>ADVO\u2019s argument that Barden was the better of the two candidates, on the basis of experience, qualifications, and chemistry, suffices to meet this burden. <em>Cf. id. </em>at 802-03, 93 S.Ct. 1817.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-10\">Lastly, Haas must be afforded an opportunity to rebut ADVO\u2019s purported explanation, to show that the reason given is merely pretextual. <em>Id. </em>at 804, 93 S.Ct. 1817. In determining whether Haas\u2019s rebuttal rescues him from summary judgment, we look to whether he has \u201craise[d] a genuine issue of material fact as to whether he has established pretext.\u201d <em>Nichols v. Loral Vought Sys. Corp., </em>81 F.3d 38, 41 (5th Cir.1996). In so doing, we look at rebuttal evidence in tandem with evidence presented as part of the <em>prima facie </em>ease. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b835-12\">Haas\u2019s only evidence that possibly could rebut ADVO\u2019s explanation is the statements made by Rosengarden regarding Haas\u2019s age. Between his second and third interviews, Haas was told by Rosengarden that Rosen-garden\u2019s \u201conly concerns about hiring [Haas] were [his] age_\u201d Construing all reasonable inferences in favor of Haas, we find that this statement, in light of its circumstances, precludes summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-14\">Although, as ADVO forcefully argues, Parnell \u2014 and not Rosengarden \u2014 had ultimate hiring authority, it would be inappropriate for us to infer that Rosengarden\u2019s recommendation to Parnell regarding Haas was both (1) free from the taint of his concerns regarding Haas\u2019s age and (2) inconsequential to Parnell\u2019s final decision. It is more reasonable to infer that Rosengarden\u2019s expressed concern over lack of \u201cchemistry\u201d between the office and Haas was linked to Haas\u2019s age and that Rosengarden\u2019s input indeed was influential in Parnell\u2019s decision making.</p>\n<p id=\"b835-15\">Instructive in our treatment of Rosengarden\u2019s remarks is <em>Brown v. CSC Logic, Inc., </em>82 F.3d 651, 655-56 (5th Cir.1996), in which we noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b835-16\">remarks may serve as sufficient evidence of age discrimination if the offered comments are: 1) age related; 2) proximate in time to the [employment decision]; 3) made by an individual with authority over the employment decision at issue; and 4) related to the employment decision at issue. Comments that are \u201cvague and remote in time\u201d are insufficient to establish discrimination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b835-17\">Id. at 655. Rosengarden\u2019s statements were not \u201cvague and remote in time,\u201d but rather were closely connected in subject matter and time to the employment decision. <em>Brown </em>suggests, therefore, that Rosengarden\u2019s com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"734\">*734</page-number>ments be viewed as evidence of discrimination as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-3\">We also reject ADVO\u2019s argument that only Parnell was a relevant decision maker and that Rosengarden exerted no influence over Parnell\u2019s ultimate decision. The record does not support this argument, and the inference we make must be to the contrary. Likewise, we reject ADVO\u2019s assertion that no causal nexus between Rosengarden\u2019s statements and Parnell\u2019s decision exists as a matter of law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b836-4\">Because we do not construe Haas\u2019s evidence to constitute \u201cdirect evidence\u201d of discrimination, however, we do not reach the issue of ADVO\u2019s mixed-motives defense.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Instead, we merely conclude that Rosengar-den\u2019s statements provide indirect, inferential evidence of discrimination, albeit sufficient evidence to defeat summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b836-5\">The summary judgment is REVERSED, and this matter is REMANDED for further appropriate proceedings. We express no views as to the ultimate merits of the claim; we conclude only that the matter should not be resolved on summary judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b836-19\">. <em>See Long v. Eastfield College, </em>88 F.3d 300, 307 (5th Cir.1996) (\"The degree to which [the ultimate hiring officer's decisions were based on his own independent investigation is a question of <em>fact which has yet to be resolved at the district court level. </em>Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to [plaintiffs], we must assume on appeal that [hiring officer] merely 'rubber stamped\u2019 the recommendations of [his subordinates].\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b836-24\">. <em>See Mooney v.
