Appellant asserts that the district court erred in imposing a 16-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) (1997). He contends that the term \u201caggravated felony\u201d as used in that section does not include his prior Florida felony conviction for possessing cocaine. We review the district court\u2019s interpretation of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo. <em>United States v. Bozza, </em>132 F.3d 659, 661 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-8\">Section 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) of the 1997 Sentencing Guidelines provides for a 16-level enhancement if the defendant previously was deported after a conviction for an aggravated felony. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) (1997).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The commentary to Section 2L1.2(b)(l)(A) defines \u201caggravated felony\u201d as it is defined in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43), which, in turn, defines \u201caggravated felony\u201d in Section 1101(a)(43)(B) to include a \u201cdrug trafficking crime (as defined in section 924(c) of Title 18).\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, comment (n. 1) (1997). Section 924(c) defines the term \u201cdrug trafficking crime\u201d to include \u201cany felony punishable under the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 801 et seq.), the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act (21 U.S.C. 951 et seq.), or the Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act (46 U.S.C.App.1901 et seq.).\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(2). We agree with the other circuits that have addressed this question that for a drug offense to come within 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(2), and hence to fit within the definition of aggravated felony, two criteria must be met: (1) the offense must be punishable under one of the three enumerated statutes, and (2) the offense must be a felony. <em>See United States v. Restrepo-Aguilar, </em>74 F.3d 361, 364 (1st Cir.1996); <em>United States v. Polanco, </em>29 F.3d 35, 38 (2d Cir.1994); <em>United States v. Hinojosa-Lopez, </em>130 F.3d 691, 694 (5th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Briones-Mata, </em>116 F.3d 308, 309-310 (8th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Garcia-Olmedo, </em>112 F.3d 399, 400-401 (9th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Cabrera-Sosa, </em>81 F.3d 998, 1000 (10th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b1374-21\">Appellant does not dispute the first criterion. The Controlled Substances Act (CSA) provides that possession of cocaine is a punishable offense, albeit as a misdemeanor. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 844(a). Appellant does dispute the second criterion, contending that his pri- or conviction is not an \u201caggravated felony\u201d because it is only a misdemeanor offense under the CSA. <em>Id. </em>He reads 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(2) to define \u201cdrug trafficking crime\u201d as any offense punishable as a felony under the CSA. Simon ignores the plain language of the CSA which defines a felony as \u201cany Federal or State offense classified by applicable Federal or State law as a felony.\u201d 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 802(13); <em>see also Restrepo-Aguilar, </em>74 F.3d at 364 (\u201cSection 924(c)(2)\u2019s definition of \u2018drug trafficking crime\u2019 by its terms includes \u2018any felony\u2019 that is criminalized under the CSA.\u201d). Since Appellant was convicted of possession of cocaine, a third-degree felony under Florida law, he has committed a felony for purposes of Section 924(c)(2). The district court therefore correctly imposed a 16-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1374-22\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1374-10\">. We apply the version of the Sentencing Guidelines and commentary in effect on the date of sentencing, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(4)-(5), unless a more lenient punishment would result under the Guidelines version in effect on the date the offense was committed. <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>993 F.2d 214, 216 (11th Cir.1993) (internal citations omitted). We therefore apply the 1997 version of the Sentencing Guidelines, which was in effect at the time of sentencing on December 11, 1997, instead of the 1995 Sentencing Guidelines in effect at the time of Simon\u2019s offense on May 27, 1997, because the same punishment would result under both versions of the Guidelines.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1374-25\">. Simon also contends that the state law definition of drug \"trafficking\u201d does not include his prior conviction for simple possession of cocaine. Smith\u2019s argument is meritless because trafficking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1273\">*1273</page-number>crimes are defined under the CSA and federal, not state, definitions govern under the Guidelines. <em>See United States v. Tamayo, </em>80 F.3d 1514, 1523 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
