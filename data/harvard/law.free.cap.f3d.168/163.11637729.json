In relevant part, the indictment charged Pena with being found in the United States on or about June 16, 1997 after \u201chaving previously been arrested and deported from the United States on or about May 15,1997,\u201d in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">During Pena\u2019s bench trial, the Government introduced evidence that on May 15, 1997, an immigration judge ordered that Pena be removed from the United States to Mexico. Importantly, the order is captioned \u201cIN REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS\u201d and does not mention deportation. On the basis of this evidence, P\u00e9na moved for a new trial or a judgment of acquittal. He argued that the Government had failed to prove the offense charged in the indictment, illegal reentry following deportation, because the evidence showed that Pena had been \u201cremoved\u201d rather than \u201cdeported.\u201d <footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The district court denied Pena\u2019s motion for a new trial or judgment of acquittal, initially and on reconsideration, and sentenced Pena to a ten-month term of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-6\">Pena argues on appeal that the evidence is insufficient to support his conviction because the Government failed to prove that he was ever deported from the United States. He further contends that the district court allowed the Government to constructively amend the indictment by accepting proof that Pena had been \u201cremoved\u201d from the United States rather than \u201cdeported\u201d from the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-7\">In <em>United States v. Pantin, 155 F.3d 91, 92 </em>(2d Cir.1998), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S.-, 119 S.Ct. 835, 142 L.Ed.2d 691 (1999), the Second Circuit considered an argument analogous to Pena\u2019s. Having been convicted of illegal reentry in violation of \u00a7 1326(a), Pantin argued that his 1994 deportation could not serve as the basis for a sentence enhancement pursuant to \u00a7 1326(b), which provides that aliens convicted of illegal reentry under \u00a7 1326(a) may receive a sentence of up to twenty years if their \u201c \u2018removal was subsequent to a conviction for commission of an aggravated felony.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pantin, </em>155 F.3d at 91 (quoting \u00a7 1326(b)(2)). Pantin did not dispute that he had an aggravated felony conviction, but he contended that because he had been \u201cdeported,\u201d not \u201cremoved,\u201d in 1994, his sentence could not be enhanced under \u00a7 1326(b)(2). <em>See id. </em>at 91-92. The Second Circuit rejected Pantin\u2019s argument. The court noted that the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA) has \u201cd[one] away with the previous legal distinction among deportation, removal, and exclusion proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 92, citing IIRIRA \u00a7 304 (codified at 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1229-1229c). Thus, the Second Circuit concluded that the terms \u201cdeportation\u201d and \u201cremoval\u201d have the same meaning under the IIRIRA, and that Pantin\u2019s sentence could be enhanced under \u00a7 1326(b) based on his 1994 deportation. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b266-13\">We agree with the reasoning and result of the <em>Pantin </em>decision. Effective April 1, 1997, IIRIRA amended \u00a7 1326 to provide for the imposition of penalties against any alien who \u201chas been denied admission, excluded, deported, or removed or has departed the United States while an order of exclusion, deportation, or removal is outstanding, and thereafter\u201d illegally reenters, or attempts to reenter, the United States. <em>See </em>\u00a7 1326. This statutory language, under which Pena was charged and convicted, does not attach any importance to the distinction between removal and deportation; instead, it considers both as valid grounds for the imposition of penalties. Indeed, the IIRIRA provides that \u201cany reference in law to an order of removal shall be deemed to include a reference to an order of exclusion and deportation or an order of deportation.\u201d IIRIRA \u00a7 309(d); <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101, Historical and Statutory Notes, Effective date of 1996 Amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-14\">Applying this holding to Pena\u2019s case, we must reject both of his bases for appeal. He first argues that the government <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>at trial failed to present any evidence showing he had been deported, and that its evidence that he had been removed was irrelevant because removal and deportation are not the same proceeding. Next, he argues that the district court constructively amended the indictment when it convicted him only on proof of removal, when the indictment required proof of deportation. Both of these claims depend on the premise that removal and deportation are different proceedings. Because we find that removal and deportation are the same proceeding for purposes of \u00a7 1326, we refuse to reverse Pena\u2019s convictions. Accordingly, the decisions of the district court are</p>\n<p id=\"b267-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b266-10\"> Pena also argued in district court that the Government had failed to prove the elements of the offense because the order of removal was technically defective; however, he has abandoned this argument on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
