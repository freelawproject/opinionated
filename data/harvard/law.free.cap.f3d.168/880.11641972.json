JONES, Circuit Judge:</author>\n<p id=\"b983-10\">In support of a proceeding before the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce, the Republic of Kazakhstan (\u201cKazakhstan\u201d) instituted the underlying action in the Southern District of Texas for assistance in discovery pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1782. Kazakhstan requested that the district court order Murdock Baker, Jr., not a party to the arbitration, to submit to a deposition and produce certain documents related to Kazakhstan\u2019s opponent Biedermann International (\u201cBiedermann\u201d). The district court ordered the requested discovery and denied Biedermann\u2019s request for reconsideration and motion for emergency stay. On expedited appeal of the district court\u2019s final order,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> this court stayed the discovery. Having reviewed the parties\u2019 submissions and examined the language and history of \u00a7 1782, we elect to follow the Second Circuit\u2019s recent decision that \u00a7 1782 does not apply to private international arbitrations. <em>See National Broad. Co. v. Bear Stearns &amp; Co., </em>165 F.3d 184 (2d Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b983-14\">Review of the scope of \u00a7 1782 is <em>de novo. See Pritchard v. U.S. Trustee (In re England), </em>153 F.3d 232, 234 (5th Cir.1998). When interpreting a statute, this court examines the plain, common sense meaning of the statute\u2019s language. <em>See id. </em>at 235 (\u201cCourts properly assume, absent sufficient indication to the contrary, that Congress intends the words in its enactments to carry their ordinary, contemporary, common meaning.\u201d) (internal punctuation and citations omitted). If this language is unambiguous, the inquiry is ended. <em>See United States v. Investment Enters., Inc., </em>10 F.3d 263, 274 (5th Cir.1993) (\u201cExcept in rare circumstances, judicial inquiry is complete when the terms of a statute are unambiguous.\u201d). As the Second Circuit observed, however, the meaning of \u201cforeign or international tribunal\u201d is ambiguous and must be construed in light of the background and purpose of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b983-15\">From its adoption in 1855 through its amendment in 1964, \u00a7 1782 permitted a district court to provide discovery assistance only to a party involved in judicial proceedings pending before a \u201ccourt in a foreign country.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In 1964, Congress amended the statute. Section 1782 now reads, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b983-16\">The district court of the district in which a person resides or is found may order him to give his testimony or statement or to produce a document or other thing for use in a <em>proceeding in a foreign or international tribunal. </em>The order may be made ... upon the application of any interested person....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b983-17\">28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1782 (emphasis added). The decision to substitute the term \u201ctribunal\u201d for \u201ccourt\u201d was deliberate, evidencing Congress\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>intention to expand the discovery provision beyond \u201cconventional courts\u201d to include \u201cforeign administrative and quasi-judicial agenc[ies].\u201d <em>See </em>S.Rep. No. 1580, \u00a7 9 (1963), <em>reprinted in </em>1964 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3782, 3788.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-4\">But the new version of \u00a7 1782 was drafted to meld its predecessor with other statutes which facilitated discovery for international government-sanctioned tribunals. <em>See, e.g., National Broad. Co., </em>165 F.3d 184 at 188-90 (discussing combination of \u00a7 1782 with 22 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 270-270g). Neither the report of the Commission that recommended what became the 1964 version of \u00a7 1782<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> nor contemporaneous reports of the Commission\u2019s director<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> ever specifically goes beyond these types of proceedings to discuss private commercial arbitrations. There is no contemporaneous evidence that Congress contemplated extending \u00a7 1782 to the then-novel arena of international commercial arbitration.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> References in the United States Code to \u201carbitral tribunals\u201d almost uniformly concern an adjunct of a foreign government or international agency.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b984-5\">Moreover, the term \u201ctribunal\u201d lacks precision and demands judicial interpretation consistent with the statute\u2019s purpose. \u201cTribunal\u201d has been held not to include even certain types of fact-finding proceedings, like those enforcing tax assessment and currency exchange regulations, conducted under the auspices of foreign governments. <em>See, e.g., Fonseca v. Blumenthal, </em>620 F.2d 322, 323 (2d Cir.1980) (Superintendent of Exchange Control of Colombia); <em>In re Letters Rogatory Issued by Dir. of Inspection of Gov\u2019t of India, </em>385 F.2d 1017, 1020-22 (2d Cir.1967) (Indian income tax officer) (Friendly, J.); <em>see also Okubo, </em>16 F.3d at 1018-19 (Tokyo District Prosecutor\u2019s Office not \u201ctribunal\u201d). To the extent that these eases distinguished between an impartial adjudicative proceeding, the type covered by \u00a7 1782, and the inquiry of an officer with \u201can institutional interest in a particular result\u201d,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> one might infer that private international arbitrations ought to be covered. The opinions, however, also demonstrate inherent limits on the nature of a \u201ctribunal\u201d; thus, not every conceivable fact-finding or adjudicative body is covered, even when the body operates under the imprimatur of a foreign government.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-10\">Skepticism about extending \u00a7 1782 to private international arbitrations also results from a comparison with domestic United <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>States arbitration procedure. As other courts have noted,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> domestically constituted arbitration panels, but not any \u201cinterested party,\u201d can invoke federal court jurisdiction to compel discovery in limited circumstances. Further, federal courts have a duty to enforce arbitrators\u2019 summonses only within the federal district in which the arbitrators, or a majority of them, are sitting. <em>See </em>9 U.S.C. \u00a7 7. It is not likely that Congress would have chosen to authorize federal courts-to assure broader discovery in aid of foreign private arbitration than is afforded its domestic dispute-resolution counterpart. There is also a possibility that Federal Arbitration Act \u00a7 7 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1782 conflict, if the latter section encompasses foreign and international private arbitrations. Section 7 is a \u201cresidual\u201d provision, to the extent not inconsistent with the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 201, 208, and the Inter-American Convention on International Commercial Arbitration, 9 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 301, 307. The Second Circuit aptly noted that the differences in available discovery could \u201ccreate an entirely new category of disputes concerning the appointment of arbitrators and the characterization of arbitration disputes as domestic, foreign, or international.\u201d <em>See National Broad Co., </em>165 F.3d at 188-90.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-4\">Empowering arbitrators or, worse, the parties, in private international disputes to seek ancillary discovery through the federal courts does not benefit the arbitration process. Arbitration is intended as a speedy, economical, and effective means of dispute resolution. The course of the litigation before us suggests that arbitration\u2019s principal advantages may be destroyed if the parties succumb to fighting over burdensome discovery requests far from the place of arbitration. Moreover, as a creature of contract, both the substance and procedure for arbitration can be agreed upon in advance. The parties may pre-arrange discovery mechanisms directly or by selecting an established forum or body of governing principles in which the conventions of discovery are settled.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Resort to \u00a7 1782 in the teeth of such agreements suggests a party\u2019s attempt to manipulate United States court processes for tactical advantage.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Section 1782 need not be construed to demand a result that thwarts private international arbitration\u2019s greatest benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the term \u201cforeign and international tribunals\u201d in \u00a7 1782 was not intended to authorize resort to United States federal courts to assist discovery in private international arbi-trations. The provision was enlarged to further comity among nations, not to complicate and undermine the salutary device of private international arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-10\">REVERSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b983-11\">.
