The lease, after describing the demised premises, states that there is included therein an \u201caddition which at the signing of this agreement is under construction, and the completion of which addition is to be made as soon as possible.\u201d The term is stated thus: \u201cFor the term to be as specified ......at the rent as specified on other side of this agreement.\u201d An endorsement appears on the lease, as follows: \u201cThe term of this agreement extends from June 1st, 1927, until May 1, 1932, a period of Fifty-nine months. The rental to be at the signing of this agreement, and continuing only until the completion of addition now under construction, $100.00......per month. At the completion of, and commencing with the occupancy of addition by lessee, rental to be $150.00...... per month, which is to continue until May 1,1928. From May 1, 1928, and continuing until May 1, 1932, the expiration date of this lease, rental is to be $160.00...... per month. All payments to be made monthly on the first of each month at the rate applicable as per this agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-12\">The following endorsement also appears: \u201cLease between Emanuel Schwartz and L.

He also avers that defendant had made default, in that he did not pay the rent due on the first day of March, 1928, or for ten days thereafter, as required by the lease, and that, because of this default, \u201cthe rent for the whole term became due and payable and collectible\u201d; further, that defendant moved from the premises and took certain permanent fixtures therefrom, contrary to the terms of the lease. Finally, at the end of his averment of default, plaintiff gives credit for the $1,250 rent paid, as itemized in the endorsement on the lease (above recited), adding thereto an item of $368, \u201cProceeds from Landlord\u2019s Warrant,\u201d making in all $1,618, which he deducts from the above sum of $9,230, showing a balance of $7,612 due to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-14\">In striking off the judgment, the court below correctly stated that \u201cthe amount of rent due for the whole term was indefinite at the time the parties signed the lease\u201d; that the prothonotary might infer from the amount of the payments shown in the endorsement on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>the lease, \u2014 corresponding, as they do, for several months, with the exact amount of monthly rental which, under the terms of the lease, would be due after the completion of the addition therein referred to, \u2014 that the advanced rent was due, and payments had accordingly commenced, at the first date when increased payments were made; but these facts did not appear from the instrument itself and were not inevitable inferences from anything appearing thereon, since the amounts shown might have been payments in advance. Then the court correctly added: \u201cThe amount due not being ascertainable from the face of the instrument, the prothonotary could not enter judgment upon it;......the Act of 1806 gives him no power to inquire beyond\u201d the information furnished by the instrument itself. These statements accord with the precise terms of section 28 of the Act of 1806 (4 Smith\u2019s Laws, 270, 278) which reads as follows: \u201cIt shall be the duty of the prothonotary ......, on the application of any......holder......of a note......or other instrument......, in which judgment is confessed,......to enter judgment against the person or persons, who executed the same for the amount, which, from the face of the instrument, may appear to be due.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">It is important to remember, as stated in Connay v. Halstead, 73 Pa. 354, 357, that the Act of 1806 \u201cdoes not confer upon the prothonotary all the powers of an attorney-at-law to confess a judgment, but only authorizes him......to enter a judgment......for the amount which from the face of the instrument may appear to be due [or] where the sum due can be ascertained by calculation from [information furnished by] the face of the writing. [The prothonotary\u2019s power under the act] is not like the general authority of an attorney-at-law, who may appear and confess judgment and arrange the details of the judgment.\u201d Again, in Whitney v. Hopkins, 135 Pa. 246, 254, we said that, \u201cIf the amount due cannot be ascertained from the face of the instrument, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>the prothonotary cannot enter judgment upon it, for the Act of 1806 gives him no power to inquire beyond.\u201d Then, in Oberlin v. Parry, 287 Pa. 224, 228, considering this particular phase of the Act of 1806, we said that the authority there given to the prothonotary must \u201cbe strictly construed,\u201d citing earlier authorities, and we added that the instrument upon which the prothonotary acts in entering the judgment by virtue of the authority vested in him under this statute, must contain sufficient \u201cdefinite\u201d information to bring it \u201cwithin the provision of the statute,\u201d and that, if such information does not \u201cexist expressly or by clearest implication,\u201d no judgment can be entered. By the expression, \u201cclearest implication,\u201d we mean an implication so clear that only one meaning can be taken from it. In the controversy now before us, the instrument relied on by plaintiff, from which the prothonotary was to gather information to calculate the amount of the judgment, fails to furnish the definite data required by the Act of 1806; for, as suggested in the above noted opinion of the court below, it is possible to make at least two inferences from the indefinite information furnished by the endorsement on this lease (counting that endorsement as information \u201con the face of the instrument,\u201d within the meaning of the statute, as we shall do for the purposes of this case, though not deciding as a matter of law that it should be so considered). One possible inference is that the first payment of $150, on August 2,1927, established the rent at that rate as of August 1,1927, while another is that the payment in question represents, in part, rent in advance. The rent at $150 per month was, according to the lease, not to commence until the addition to the demised premises was completed, and, as before shown, the instrument on which the prothonotary acted in entering judgment contains no information on its face as to when this completion took place; therefore it furnished no definite information of a date from which to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>calculate the increased rent, and thus to arrive at the total amount of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">Meyers &amp; Joly v. Freiling, 81 Pa. Superior Ct. 116, 119, 120, where, on appeal, the court below was ordered to strike off a judgment, contains language quite appropriate to the present case. There Judge Henderson said: \u201cNo one could tell by an inspection......of the instrument [giving rise to the judgment]......what the rights of the plaintiffs and defendant were......on the day when the judgment was entered;......they could only be ascertained by an inquiry [aliunde the instrument itself]. This difficulty was recognized and an attempt was made to supply the lack of facts contained in the instrument by the filing of an affidavit made by one of the plaintiffs...... It was from this affidavit and not \u2018from the face of the instrument\u2019 the prothonotary ascertained the amount for which he entered judgment....... The judgment is therefore reversed......with direction......to the court below to strike [it] off.\u201d See also Orner v. Hurwitch, 97 Pa. Superior Ct. 263, 266-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-13\">The order appealed from is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
