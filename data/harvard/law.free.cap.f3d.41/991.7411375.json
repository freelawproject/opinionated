For the reasons assigned, we reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent herewith.</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-24\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1077-25\">George Wicks, Sr., an African-American male, applied for a management position with his employer, the Mississippi State Employment Service. The promotion was given to a white employee. Wicks filed suit against MSES and Hazel Cook, a former supervisor of Wicks, asserting both a racial discrimination claim<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and a first amendment claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> On April 13, 1994 Cook contemporaneously filed two motions: (1) a \u201cMotion to Dismiss, or in the Alternative, for Summary Judgment,\u201d which asserted the defense of qualified immunity<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and (2) a \u201cMotion to Hold <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"994\">*994</page-number>Discovery in Abeyance\u201d pending the consideration of Cook\u2019s qualified immunity defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-3\">With the motion to dismiss pending before the district court, the discovery motion was referred to a magistrate judge who issued an order staying all discovery except for that related to Cook\u2019s defense of qualified immunity. Cook objected to this limited discovery order and the district court affirmed the magistrate judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-4\">Cook appeals the order allowing discovery on the issue of qualified immunity. The motion to dismiss remains pending before the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-5\">\n<em>Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-6\">Wicks vigorously maintains that we are without subject matter jurisdiction to hear this appeal of a discovery order. \u201cOrdinarily, an order compelling limited discovery is interlocutory and not appealable under the final judgment rule....\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The Supreme Court has held, however, that orders denying substantial claims of qualified immunity are immediately appealable under the collateral order doctrine.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Cook equally vigorously contends that in allowing limited discovery on the issue of qualified immunity, the district court effectively has denied her the benefits of the qualified immunity defense, the most relevant being the protection from pretrial discovery.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, she argues, the district court\u2019s order is appealable immediately under the collateral order doctrine and this court has appellate jurisdiction. We hold today that the discovery order denied Cook the benefits of the qualified immunity defense, thereby vesting this court with the requisite jurisdiction to review the discovery order.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1078-16\">In <em>Lion Boulos v. Wilson, </em>we held that a party asserting the defense of qualified immunity is not immune from all discovery, only that which is \u201cavoidable or overly broad.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We stated that when the district court \u201cis unable to rule on the immunity defense without further clarification of the facts\u201d and when the discovery order is \u201cnarrowly tailored to uncover only those facts needed to rule on the immunity claim,\u201d an order allowing such limited discovery is neither avoidable nor overly broad.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Under those conditions, we held that the appellate court was without jurisdiction to review the discovery order.</p>\n<p id=\"b1078-17\">Discovery under <em>Lion Boulos, </em>however, must not proceed until the district court <em>first </em>finds that the plaintiffs pleadings assert facts which, if true, would overcome the defense of qualified immunity.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> This heightened pleading requirement, first artic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"995\">*995</page-number>ulated in <em>Elliott v. Perez,</em><footnotemark><em>11</em></footnotemark><em> </em>requires Wicks to allege the particular facts forming the basis of his claim, including those preventing Cook from successfully maintaining a qualified immunity defense. To overcome the immunity defense, the complaint must allege facts that, if proven, would demonstrate that Cook violated clearly established statutory or constitutional rights.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Heightened pleading demands more than bald allegations and con-clusionary statements.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Wicks must allege facts specifically focusing on the conduct of Cook which caused his injury.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1079-4\">If Wicks\u2019 complaint falls short of this standard, the district court should rule on the motion to dismiss before any discovery is allowed.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> The allowance of discovery without this threshold showing is immediately appealable as a denial of the true measure of protection of qualified immunity.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> If the complaint alleges facts to overcome the defense of qualified immunity, the district court may then proceed under <em>Lion Boulos </em>to allow the discovery necessary to clarify those facts upon which the immunity defense turns.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1079-5\">Thus, the initial step in our review requires an examination of Wicks\u2019 complaint to see if his allegations negate Cook\u2019s defense of qualified immunity. In so doing, we find two allegations against Cook. First, Wicks complains that Cook violated his first amendment rights by discriminating against him because of his protests of two reprimands issued by Cook. His complaint states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1079-14\">[T]he fact that Plaintiff [Wicks] had exercised his First Amendment rights by appealing and protesting two unjustified write-ups given him by the Defendant, Hazel Cook, Plaintiffs supervisor, also contributed to the failure to get the promotion. Hazel Cook contributed to Plaintiffs failure to get the promotion because she entertains a hostility toward Plaintiff because of his protesting the unjustified write-ups that she had given him.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b1079-15\">[H]er adverse comments about Plaintiff, ... based upon Plaintiffs protesting unjustified employment actions against him was [sic] also a proximate cause of Plaintiffs not getting the promotion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1079-17\">Our decisions have established that a public employee asserting a first amendment claim against his employer must show that the speech in question involves a matter of public concern, that his interest in commenting upon those matters is greater than the defendant\u2019s interest in promoting efficiency in de<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"996\">*996</page-number>livery of public services, and that his speech motivated the defendant\u2019s offensive acts.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1080-4\">Wicks\u2019 allegations fail to suggest how Cook violated his clearly-established first amendment rights. The most expansive reading of his complaint discloses no basis for a finding that his charges about poor \u201cwrite-ups\u201d are a matter of public concern. Moreover, the allegation that his speech motivated Cook\u2019s tortious acts is wholly conclusionary. Nor did Wicks allege exactly what he believes Cook did to prevent his promotion.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The gravamen of Wicks\u2019 complaint appears to be nothing more than an attempt to redress a personal grievance, a claim not generally actionable against a public employer.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1080-5\">Wicks also complains that Cook discriminated against him on the basis of race,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> stating in his complaint that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1080-6\">Hazel Cook customarily and habitually treated black employees in a less favorable fashion than white employees, and her adverse comments about Plaintiff, based upon race and based upon Plaintiffs protesting unjustified employment actions against him, was also a proximate cause of Plaintiffs not getting the promotion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1080-11\">Again, Wicks makes only broad and wholly conclusional allegations that Cook discriminated against him on the basis of race. While Wicks does allege racial animus, an element of the <em>prima facie </em>case for his discrimination claim, he fails to allege any conduct of Cook that could be considered to \u201cviolate a clearly established statutory ... right.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> At best, Wicks states the conclusion that his race is the cause of any adverse comments Cook may have made. Wicks must allege particular facts showing behavior by Cook motivated by racial animus. To merely make the charge is insufficient; the complaint must \u201cstate with factual detail and particularity the basis for the claim which necessarily includes why the defendant-official cannot successfully maintain the defense of immunity.\u201d <footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Wicks\u2019 complaint is devoid of such detail; accordingly, we conclude that Wicks has failed to state a racial discrimination claim sufficient to overcome Cook\u2019s defense of qualified immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1080-12\">Because we find that Wicks failed to meet the threshold pleading requirements for either of his claims, we hold that <em>any </em>discovery by Wicks, even that limited in scope, is improper and immediately appealable as a denial of the benefits of the qualified immunity defense. Because of this disposition of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"997\">*997</page-number>discovery issue, we need not address whether the immunity defense sufficiently turned on a factual issue requiring discovery under <em>Lion Boulos. </em>Moreover, we need not address Cook\u2019s contention that the discovery order was overly broad.</p>\n<p id=\"AWR\">We are aware that by requiring heightened pleading before discovery some plaintiffs will be unable to state a claim. But, as noted in the concurring opinion in <em>Elliott, </em>the \u201cdenial of some meritorious claims is the direct product, of the immunity doctrine which weighed these losses when it struck the policy balance.\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> The seeming unfairness of this conclusion is tempered by this circuit\u2019s directives to allow a plaintiff initially failing to state a claim the opportunity to amend or supplement the pleadings freely, so that he may state his best case.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Where the plaintiff has filed only one pleading, as Wicks has here, immediate dismissal ordinarily is not justified.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Thus, on remand, Wicks should be given an opportunity to plead his ease properly before dismissal is considered.</p>\n<p id=\"A3T\">The denial of Cook\u2019s request for a protective order preventing all discovery until consideration of the motion to dismiss is REVERSED and the request is GRANTED. We REMAND to the district court for consideration of the motion to dismiss in a manner consistent herewith.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1077-15\">. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 (Supp. Ill 1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1077-16\">. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 (1988).

Although the heightened pleading standard enunciated in <em>Elliott </em>has been applied only in the context of section 1983 claims, the rationale of that decision applies to all civil rights actions where the defense of qualified immunity is asserted.

Cook asks this court to hold that a motion to dismiss must be considered prior to the allowance of any discovery. We disagree. While we hold today that <em>Lion Boulos </em>requires a preliminary consideration of the pleadings prior to the allowance of discovery on the issue of qualified immunity, this inquiry need not result in a ruling on a motion to dismiss. Indeed, <em>Lion Boulos </em>illustrates a situation where a plaintiff satisfies the heightened pleading but alleges facts upon which the immunity defense turns which are disputed by the defendant. In such a situation, <em>Lion Boulos </em>held that discovery limited to the issue of the immunity defense could proceed \"before ruling on a defendant's motion to dismiss. ...\" 834 F.2d at 507. Thus, we impose no requirement that the district court must rule on a motion to dismiss prior to the allowance of discovery in all situations. Rather, we hold simply that if the pleadings fail to state facts sufficient to overcome the defense of qualified immunity, then limited discovery is improper and dismissal, as qualified above, is in order.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
