The trial court concluded that the investigating officer unlawfully entered the property where the brothers lived with their father. We agree that the officer\u2019s initial entry onto the property was unlawful. We further conclude that brothers\u2019 father could not effectively retroactively consent to the unlawful invasion of brothers\u2019 privacy interests. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">The material facts are as follows: On October 12, 1998, Trooper Pearson of the Oregon State Police Fish and Wildlife Division received a teletype that an anonymous caller had reported that \u201c[Brothers], who live at North Way in North Bend, have shot four bucks and a spike so far this year and none have been tagged. All are hanging in a shop at the residence.\u201d In response to the teletype, Pearson drove to the property where brothers lived with their father. The property was completely fenced, with the exception of a gated driveway leading 150 to 200 yards from the public road to the residence. Three \u201cKeep Out - No Trespassing\u201d signs were fixed at intervals on the fence between the property and the public road. When Pearson reached the driveway, he saw a sign posted on the fence next to the gate that read:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6v\">\u201cPRIVATE ROAD NO UNAUTHORIZED PERSONS BEYOND THIS POINT.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">Pearson testified that he understood the sign to mean that the property owner wanted to exclude people who did not have \u201ca legitimate reason to be there,\u201d but that he believed that he was authorized to enter because he wished to contact brothers to discuss the game-violation report. Pearson drove <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>up the driveway, parked beside the house, and got out of his car. He saw a garage roughly 50 feet away, and, because the garage door was raised about four or five feet, he could see the hindquarters of two skinned deer hanging inside the garage.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">At that point, brothers\u2019 father came out of a barn next to the house, and Pearson introduced himself. Father did not, at that time or at any time thereafter, tell Pearson that he was trespassing, ask him to leave, or give any other indication that Pearson was unwelcome on the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">After engaging in some small talk, Pearson then \u201casked [father] if he would mind if I checked the tags on the deer that I could see hanging in the garage.\u201d Pearson testified that father \u201ctold me to help myself.\u201d After further discussion about the number of deer in the garage and whether they were tagged, Pearson again asked if they could go take a look in the garage, and father said they could.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Pearson and father then walked over to the garage together, father rolled the garage door the rest of the way up, and they entered the garage. Once inside, Pearson saw four untagged buck deer carcasses, one of which was a spike deer.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Brothers were charged with having committed acts that, had they been adults, would constitute the crimes of failure to tag a deer, ORS 496.162, exceeding the bag limit on buck deer, ORS 498.002, and unlawfully taking a spike deer. ORS 498.002. Before trial, brothers moved to suppress all evidence obtained following Pearson\u2019s warrantless entry onto the property, asserting, <em>inter alia, </em>that that entry was unlawful because the clearly posted sign, \u201cPRIVATE ROAD NO UNAUTHORIZED PERSONS BEYOND THIS POINT,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>expressly manifested an intent to exclude the public. The state responded that (1) the posted sign did not adequately exclude all members of the public because it suggested that persons with \u201clegitimate business\u201d were free to enter, and (2) even if Pearson\u2019s initial entry on the property was unlawful, father\u2019s subsequent consent to Pearson\u2019s request to search the garage retroactively ratified, and validated, Pearson\u2019s initial unlawful entry. The state did <em>not </em>argue, under <em>State v. Rodriguez, </em>317 Or 27, 854 P2d 399 (1993), that father\u2019s consent to the search of the garage was not the product of exploitation of any prior illegality in entering the property and, that, thus, regardless of whether the initial entry was unlawful, the search of the garage was lawful.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">The trial court rejected the state\u2019s arguments. The court concluded that the driveway sign was \u201csufficient warning and sufficient expression of the intent\u201d to exclude the public from the property. Moreover, although making a specific finding that, after Pearson\u2019s initial unlawful entry, the \u201crest of the <em>search\u201d </em>\u2014 i.e., the search of the garage \u2014 was consensual, the court implicitly rejected the state\u2019s \u201cretroactive consent\u201d argument. Accordingly, the court granted brothers\u2019 motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">The state appeals, reiterating its alternative arguments that Pearson\u2019s entry was lawful and that, in all events, father, by consenting to the search of the garage, necessarily retroactively consented to Pearson\u2019s antecedent \u201ctrespass.\u201d As amplified below, we reject both arguments.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\"><em>State v. Dixson/Digby, </em>307 Or 195, 766 P2d 1015 (1988), and its progeny, frame our analysis of the lawfulness of Pearson\u2019s initial entry. In <em>Dixson/Digby, </em>the Supreme Court announced that \u201cthe search and seizure provision in the Oregon Constitution [, Article I, section 9,] protects land outside the \u2018curtilage\u2019 of a residence\u201d under certain conditions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-7\">\u201cAn individual\u2019s privacy interest in land he or she has left unimproved and unbounded is not sufficient to trigger the protections of Article I, section 9. Thus, it is not sufficient that the property in question is privately owned, or that it is shielded from view by vegetation or topographical barriers, because those features do not necessarily indicate the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>owner\u2019s intention that the property be kept private. <em>A person who wishes to preserve a constitutionally protected privacy interest in land outside the curtilage must manifest an intention to exclude the public by erecting barriers to entry, such as fences, or by posting signs. </em>* * * [I]f land is fenced, posted or otherwise closed off, one does not enter it without permission or, in the officers\u2019 situation, permission or a warrant.\u201d 307 Or at 211-12 (emphasis added).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">Applying that rule, the court concluded that the officers had not conducted an illegal search by entering the defendants\u2019 property. The court reasoned that, although the defendants had posted \u201cNo Hunting\u201d signs and blocked vehicle access to their property with a cable across the road, the signs and cable did not express an intent to exclude persons from the property entirely, such as for uses other than hunting. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">In several <em>post-Dixson/Digby </em>cases, we have considered whether a landowner\u2019s posting of a sign or signs on the property manifests a clear intent to exclude the public, thereby creating a protected privacy interest in the property under the Oregon Constitution. For example, in <em>State v. Gorham, </em>121 Or App 347, 353, 854 P2d 971, <em>rev den </em>318 Or 171 (1993), we concluded that, where the defendant had posted \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d and \u201cNo Hunting\u201d signs on trees in a field adjacent to the defendant\u2019s driveway but separated from it by a fence, the signs did not \u201cestablish that the defendant intended to restrict access to his driveway.\u201d Similarly, in <em>State v. Gabbard, </em>129 Or App 122, 877 P2d 1217, <em>rev den </em>320 Or 131 (1994), the defendant had posted \u201cKeep Out\u201d and \u201cBeware of Dog\u201d signs near the beginning of his driveway, which the officers did not see, and a \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d sign on a boundary fence next to the driveway, which the officers did see. We concluded that the signs at the beginning of the driveway did not manifest an intent to exclude because the officers, in good faith, failed to see them.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We further concluded that the sign on the boundary fence did not adequately convey an intent to exclude because \u201c[a] reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>visitor could have assumed that that sign was intended only to exclude those who might put the property to their own uses, but that it did not apply to visitors who desired to contact the residents.\u201d <em>Gabbard, </em>129 Or App at 128.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\">Conversely, in <em>State v. Poulos, </em>149 Or App 351, 942 P2d 901 (1997), we concluded that the defendant\u2019s signs succeeded in manifesting a clear intent to exclude the public from accessing his residence via the driveway. There, the defendant had posted a sign directly to the right of the driveway entrance reading \u201cNo Hunting or Trespassing Under Penalty of Law,\u201d a \u201cGuard Dog On Duty\u201d sign beyond that, and a large red \u201cSTOP\u201d sign further up the driveway. We rejected the state\u2019s argument that only a gate or barrier could sufficiently express an intent to exclude the public from entering a driveway, and concluded that \u201c[t]here was no evidence that even the customary casual visitor would be welcome on [the] defendant\u2019s property.\u201d <em>Poulos, </em>149 Or App at 356-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\"> In this case, the state argues that the driveway sign, \u201cPRIVATE ROAD NO UNAUTHORIZED PERSONS BEYOND THIS POINT,\u201d did not effectively exclude the public. The state\u2019s principal argument is that the sign excluded only \u201cunauthorized persons,\u201d and that \u201cany ordinary citizen\u201d would reasonably understand that \u201ca person [like Pearson] having legitimate business with [brothers\u2019 family] would be sufficiently \u2018authorized\u2019 to drive up the driveway and ring the doorbell.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Defendants respond that the totality of the circumstances, and the wording of the sign in particular, clearly evinced an intent to exclude any person who did not have permission to enter. We agree with defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>Here, the sign on the property was posted on the fence immediately to the right of the driveway gate. The sign was plainly visible,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and Pearson testified that he saw the sign. Both the location of the sign and its express reference to the driveway (\u201cPrivate Road\u201d) make it clear that the sign related to the driveway \u2014 and not, <em>see, e.g., Gorham, </em>121 Or App at 353, to the field behind the fence.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">We further reject the state\u2019s assertion that the words \u201cunauthorized persons\u201d expressed an intent to exclude only persons \u201cwithout legitimate business\u201d on the property. Rather, an objectively reasonable member of the public would understand that \u201cauthorization\u201d to enter must be obtained from the property owner \u2014 and not from the putative trespasser\u2019s self-assessment of the legitimacy of his or her business. If the state\u2019s view were correct, then political canvassers, religious proselytizers, and Girl Scouts selling cookies could all invade the property in their service of some perceived greater good. In this connection, we emphasize that police officers are no more \u201cauthorized\u201d than anyone else to invade property, absent the legal sanction of a warrant or some exigency. Pearson\u2019s initial entry onto the property was, consequently, unlawful.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">We proceed to the state\u2019s alternative \u201cretroactive consent\u201d argument. Relying on <em>State v. Weaver, </em>319 Or 212, 874 P2d 1322 (1994), the state argues that, in the totality of the circumstances, father\u2019s express consent to Pearson\u2019s request to search the garage constituted effective retroactive consent to Pearson\u2019s antecedent trespass. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">At the outset, we emphasize, and reiterate, that the state is <em>not </em>arguing that, under <em>Rodriguez, </em>father\u2019s consent to the search of the garage rendered that search lawful regardless of any prior illegality. The state did not make a <em>Rodriguez-based </em>argument to the trial court, <em>see </em>163 Or App at 501, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>and appellate counsel candidly acknowledged that omission. The state\u2019s alternative argument rests solely on <em>Weaver.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">In <em>Weaver, </em>several officers began searching the defendant\u2019s secondhand store for evidence of violations of certain county ordinances without a warrant or consent. While that search was in progress, a deputy contacted the defendant store owner at another location to ask for his consent to search the store. 319 Or at 214-15. Without any knowledge of the search in progress at his store, and several hours after the officers started searching his store, the defendant signed a written consent form. The state argued that the defendant\u2019s consent retroactively validated the search and seizures that occurred before he consented. The Supreme Court agreed with the state that a consent <em>could </em>\u201crelate back\u201d to validate an otherwise unlawful earlier search. <em>Id. </em>at 221-22. However, such retroactive consent can be found only where there is evidence \u201cthat the person giving the consent intended the consent to be retroactive.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Applying that rule, the court concluded that the evidence did not demonstrate that the defendant intended to retroactively consent to the earlier search.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">In <em>State v. Larson, </em>159 Or App 34, 977 P2d 1175, <em>rev den </em>329 Or 318 (1999), we addressed <em>Weaver\u2019s </em>application to a purported retroactive consent to search given by a third party, and not by the defendant. There, police officers, without prior consent, entered a common area at the rear of an apartment building and, from that point, smelled the odor of marijuana wafting from the defendant\u2019s second floor apartment. Several months later, after being charged with drug offenses, the defendant moved to suppress evidence discovered as a result of the officers\u2019 observations, arguing that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>officers\u2019 unconsented to and warrantless entry into the rear area was unlawful. Thereafter, the police obtained written consent from another tenant that purported to explicitly authorize the initial entry. The trial court granted the motion to suppress, and the state appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">In affirming, we rejected the state\u2019s argument that the third-party tenant\u2019s \u201cconsent\u201d validly effectuated retroactive consent under Weaver:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-5\">\u201cThe state is correct that, in <em>Weaver, </em>under some circumstances, a defendant\u2019s consent may \u2018relate back\u2019 to the beginning of a search if there is evidence in the record that the defendant intended the consent to be retroactive. By consenting to the search after the fact, the defendant is essentially waiving any objection to the unlawfulness of the earlier police conduct. This case, however, presents a different question from <em>Weaver </em>because the consent here was not obtained from the defendant but, rather, from a third party. We decline to hold that, under the circumstances here, a third party may waive the unlawfulness of police conduct with respect to the defendant.\u201d <em>Larson, </em>159 Or App at 42-43.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">Thus, our premise in <em>Larson </em>was that retroactive consent is \u201cessentially\u201d a matter of waiver and that a third party cannot waive a prior violation of another person\u2019s constitutionally protected interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">That principle is conclusive here. In entering the property unlawfully, Pearson violated not only father\u2019s privacy interests but brothers\u2019 as well. Father could, by retroactive consent, waive that violation as to himself. But he could not waive that violation as to his sons.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">The trial court properly allowed the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b533-8\"> Both brothers were charged with acts that would constitute the crime of failure to tag a deer, ORS 496.162, one brother was charged with exceeding the bag limit on buck deer, ORS 498.002, and the other brother was charged with unlawfully taking a spike deer. ORS 498.002.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b533-11\"> At the suppression hearing, the parties disputed whether, when Pearson arrived, the gate was open or closed and chained but not locked. Given our analysis and disposition as to the lawfulness of Pearson\u2019s entry, we need not resolve that dispute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b534-7\"> At the hearing, father testified that he never gave Pearson consent or permission to look in the garage. However, based on its belief that the \u201cofficer\u2019s testimony was probably more accurate,\u201d the trial court made a specific finding that Pearson\u2019s search of the garage was a \u201cconsensual search.\u201d We defer to the trial court\u2019s credibility-based finding that, contrary to the father\u2019s testimony, he did, in fact, explicitly agree that Pearson could search the garage. <em>See Short and Short, </em>155 Or App 5, 18, 964 P2d 1033 (1998) (\u201cAlthough our review is <em>de novo, </em>because the trial court is in a better position to assess the credibility of the witnesses, we defer to the trial court\u2019s assessment of the witnesses\u2019 credibility * * i!.\u201d). <em>Accord State v.
