GABLEMAN, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b129-3\">\u00b6 1. In March 2011, the Wisconsin Legislature passed Act 10,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a budget repair bill proposed by Governor Scott Walker. Act 10 significantly altered Wisconsin's public employee labor laws. Act 10 prohibits general employees from collectively bargaining on issues other than base wages, prohibits municipal employers from deducting labor organization dues from paychecks of general employees, imposes annual recertification requirements, and prohibits fair share agreements requiring non-represented general employees to make contributions to labor organizations.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">\u00b6 2. In August 2011, Madison Teachers, Inc. and Public Employees Local 61 sued Governor Walker and the three commissioners of the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission challenging several provisions of Act 10. The plaintiffs alleged, among other things, that four aspects of Act 10 \u2014 the collective bargaining limitations, the prohibition on payroll deductions of labor organization dues, the prohibition of fair share agreements, and the annual recertification requirements\u2014 violate the constitutional associational and equal protection rights of the employees they represent. The plaintiffs also challenged Wis. Stat. \u00a7 62.623 (2011-12),<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> a separate provision created by Act 10, which prohibits the City of Milwaukee from paying the employee share <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>of contributions to the City of Milwaukee Employes'<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Retirement System, alleging it violates the home rule amendment to the Wisconsin Constitution. The plaintiffs argued, in the alternative, that if Wis. Stat. \u00a7 62.623 does not violate the home rule amendment, it nevertheless violates the constitutionally protected right of parties to contract with each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">\u00b6 3. The Dane County Circuit Court, Judge Juan B. Colas, presiding, invalidated several provisions of Act 10, including the provisions relating to collective bargaining limitations, union recertifications, and the prohibitions on fair share agreements and payroll deductions of labor organization dues. The court of appeals certified the case to this court, pursuant to Wis. Stat. \u00a7 809.61. We now uphold Act 10 in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">I. BACKGROUND AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b130-6\">\u00b6 4. Plaintiff-Respondents are Madison Teachers, Inc. (\"MTI\"), Public Employees Local 61 (\"Local 61\"), and their respective representatives, Peggy Coyne and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>John Weigman. MTI is a labor organization representing over 4,000 municipal employees of the Madison Metropolitan School District. Local 61 is a labor organization representing approximately 300 City of Milwaukee employees.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b131-4\">\u00b6 5. The Defendant-Appellants are Governor Walker and the three commissioners of the Wisconsin Employment Relations Commission (\"WERC\"), James R. Scott, Judith Neumann, and Rodney G. Pasch (collectively, \"the defendants\"). Governor Walker and the commissioners of WERC are sued in their official capacities. Governor Walker has responsibility under Wisconsin law to implement and enforce state legislation through the agencies of the State's executive branch. The commissioners of WERC are responsible for administering Wisconsin's labor laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-5\">\u00b6 6. Wisconsin has two principal labor laws, the Municipal Employment Relations Act (\"MERA\"), Wis. Stat. \u00a7 111.70 <em>et seq., </em>and the State Employee Labor Relations Act (\"SELRA\"), Wis. Stat. \u00a7 111.80 <em>et seq., </em>which govern employment relations and collective bargaining for public employees and labor organizations.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"22\">*22</page-number>\u00b6 7. In 2011, the Wisconsin Legislature enacted 2011 Wisconsin Act 10, a budget repair bill proposed by Governor Walker. Act 10, among other things, modified MERA to prohibit general employees from collective bargaining on issues other than \"base wages,\" prohibited fair share agreements, imposed annual recertification requirements, and prohibited municipal employers from deducting labor organization dues from the paychecks of general employees.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b132-3\">\u00b6 8. MTI and Local 61 (together with the individual plaintiffs, \"the plaintiffs\") filed the instant action in Dane County Circuit Court in August 2011 seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that certain portions o\u00ed<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Act 10 violated the Wisconsin Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-4\">\u00b6 9. In November 2011, the plaintiffs sought summary judgment on the following claims: (1) that Act 10 violates the plaintiffs' right to free association guaranteed by Article I, Sections 3 and 4 of the Wisconsin Constitution through the combined effect of (a) prohibiting general employees from collective bargaining on issues other than \"base wages,\" and requiring any base wage increase exceeding a cost of living adjustment to be approved by a municipal voter referendum, (b) prohibiting municipal employers from deducting labor organization dues from the paychecks of general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"23\">*23</page-number>employees, (c) prohibiting fair share agreements,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and (d) requiring mandatory recertification elections; (2) that Act 10 violates the plaintiffs' right to equal protection of the laws guaranteed by Article I, Section 1 of the Wisconsin Constitution by impermissibly creating classifications that disadvantage represented general employees based on the exercise of their rights to associate; (3) that certain provisions of Act 10 were enacted in a manner that violated Article VI, Section 11 of the Wisconsin Constitution, which governs special sessions of the legislature, by not being related to the stated purpose of the special session; (4) that Act 10 violates the home rule amendment to the Wisconsin Constitution by mandating that City of Milwaukee employees make certain contributions to the City of Milwaukee Employes' Retirement System (\"Milwaukee ERS\") and, in doing so, interfering with the City of Milwaukee's home-rule authority; (5) that Act 10 violates the Contract Clauses of the United States and Wisconsin Constitutions by unconstitutionally impairing Local 61's vested contractual right to the City of Milwaukee funding the employee share of contributions to the Milwaukee ERS; and (6) that Act 10 violates due process by shifting the responsibility for pension contributions from the City of Milwaukee to members of Local 61, which is a deprivation of property without due process of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>\u00b6 10. In January 2012, the defendants moved for judgment on the pleadings, arguing the circuit court should deny the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and dismiss the suit with prejudice. On September 14, 2012, the circuit court issued a decision and order that denied the defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings and granted partial summary judgment to the plaintiffs. The circuit court held that Act 10 violated: (1) the plaintiffs' rights of association, free speech, and equal protection under both the United States and Wisconsin Constitutions; (2) the home rule amendment to the Wisconsin Constitution; and (3) the Contract Clause of the Wisconsin Constitution. Further, the circuit court held that Act 10 did not violate the special session limiting clause of the Wisconsin Constitution or the constitutional prohibition against taking a property interest without due process of law. Accordingly, the circuit court concluded that those sections of Act 10 found to be unconstitutional are void and without effect.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b134-4\">\u00b6 11. On September 18, 2012, the defendants filed a notice of appeal. On April 25, 2013, the court of appeals certified the case to this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">\u00b6 12. On June 14, 2013, this court accepted the certification.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"AG9\">\u00b6 13. The issue before this court is whether certain provisions of Act 10 violate the United States and Wisconsin Constitutions. The constitutionality of a statute is a question of law that we review de novo. <em>State v. Randall, </em>192 Wis. 2d 800, 824, 532 N.W.2d 94 (1995). All legislative acts are presumed constitutional and we must indulge every presumption to sustain the law. <em>Id. </em>Any doubt that exists regarding the constitutionality of the statute must be resolved in favor of its constitutionality. <em>State ex rel. Hammermill Paper Co. v. La Plante, </em>58 Wis. 2d 32, 47, 205 N.W.2d 784 (1973). Consequently, it is insufficient for a party to demonstrate \"that the statute's constitutionality is doubtful or that the statute is probably unconstitutional.\" <em>Wis. Med. Soc'y, Inc. v. Morgan, </em>2010 WI 94, \u00b6 37, 328 Wis. 2d 469, 787 N.W.2d 22 (citing <em>State v. Smith, </em>2010 WI 16, \u00b6 8, 323 Wis. 2d 377, 780 N.W.2d 90). Instead, the presumption can be overcome only if the party establishes the statute's unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b136-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>\u00b6 14. This case also presents questions of statutory interpretation, which this court reviews de novo. <em>Covenant Healthcare Sys., Inc. v. City of Wauwatosa, </em>2011 WI 80, \u00b6 21, 336 Wis. 2d 522, 800 N.W.2d 906.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">\u00b6 15. This appeal presents four issues: (1) whether Act 10 impermissibly infringes on the associational rights of general employees; (2) whether Act 10 impermissibly infringes on the equal protection rights of represented general employees when compared to non-represented general employees; (3) whether Act 10 violates the home rule amendment to the Wisconsin Constitution by prohibiting the City of Milwaukee from paying the employee share of pension contributions to the Milwaukee ERS; and (4) whether Act 10 violates the Contract Clause of the Wisconsin Constitution by significantly impairing the contractual rights of City of Milwaukee employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">\u00b6 16. We address each issue in turn. However, because terminology is critical to interpreting the parties' arguments, it is important that we review certain relevant terms before beginning our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">A. Terminology</p>\n<p id=\"b136-9\">\u00b6 17. The heart of this appeal centers on unions, collective bargaining, and the right to associate with others to collectively engage in protected First Amendment activities. These issues are always emotionally charged, especially in turbulent times, but perhaps nowhere are these topics more controversial or sensitive than in the State of Wisconsin. The importance of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>these questions demands clarity on what precisely is before the court, which in turn requires specificity on our part in the terminology upon which we rely.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-4\">\u00b6 18. With respect to the term \"collective bargaining,\" we agree with the court of appeals that the following discussion provided by an amicus effectively highlights an important definitional distinction:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-6\">Historically, in the United States the term \"collective bargaining\" has been used to describe two legally different activities .... The first way in which the term has been used has been to describe an activity that is an element of the right of individual citizens to associate together for the purpose of advocating regarding matters of mutual interest or concern, including matters concerning wages and employment conditions. When used in this way the term \"collective bargaining\" is descriptive of a collective effort and refers to an activity where the party that is the object of the advocacy, the employer, has no legal obligation to respond affirmatively to the advocacy, but may do so voluntarily.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-7\">.... [This type of \"collective bargaining\"] is a fundamental right that constitutionally is protected.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-8\">The second way in which the term \"collective bargaining\" has been used is to refer to a statutorily mandated relationship between an association of employees and their employer, by the terms of which an employer and its employees are obligated to negotiate, in \"good faith,\" for the purpose of reaching an agreement regarding the employees' wages and conditions of employment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b137-9\">Such statutorily recognized \"collective bargaining\" is subject to legislative modification, for the purpose, at least heretofore, of protecting the employees' fundamental right to bargain with their employer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b137-10\">Brief for Laborer's Local 236 and AFSCME Local 60 as Amici Curiae at 3, 6-7 (some citations omitted). As the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>court of appeals did in its certification to this court, we use the term \"collective bargaining\" in the latter sense; that is, to refer to the statutorily established relationship between an association of public employees and their employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-3\">\u00b6 19. This definition of \"collective bargaining\" is consistent with the language of Act 10, which defines \"collective bargaining\" to mean \"the performance of the mutual obligation of a municipal employer .. . and the representative of its municipal employees in a collective bargaining unit, to meet and confer at reasonable times, in good faith, with the intention of reaching an agreement, or to resolve questions arising under such an agreement,\" with respect to wages for general employees. Wis. Stat. \u00a7 111.70(l)(a). A \"collective bargaining unit\" is a \"unit consisting of municipal employees\" that has been recognized by WERC, pursuant to statute, as qualified for the purpose of collective bargaining. Stat. \u00a7 111.70(l)(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">\u00b6 20. Further, under Act 10, for the purpose of collective bargaining, a \"representative\" may be chosen \"by a majority of the municipal employees voting in a collective bargaining unit [and] shall be the exclusive representative of all employees in the unit.. .. \" Wis. Stat. \u00a7 111.70(4)(d)l. This \"representative\" could potentially be a \"labor organization,\" which is defined as \"any employee organization in which employees participate and which exists for the purpose, in whole or in part, of engaging in collective bargaining with municipal employers . . . .\" Wis. Stat. \u00a7 111.70(l)(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">\u00b6 21. Unlike the term \"labor organization,\" \"union\" is not defined under Act 10, though as the court of appeals noted, the parties use the term in two distinct ways. First, the term \"union\" may refer to what the parties in this case agree is a constitutionally <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>protected association that individuals have the right to form and employers have the right to disregard. However, the term \"union\" may also refer to the \"representative\" of a \"collective bargaining unit\" in the statutorily established relationship between an association of public employees and their employer. For this reason, we follow the practice of the court of appeals and generally avoid use of the term \"union.\" Instead, when referring to the \"exclusive certified bargaining agent\" of a collective bargaining unit, as that term is understood within the statutory framework established by Act 10, we use the term \"certified representative.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b139-4\">\u00b6 22. Finally, we refer to a general employee that has chosen to participate in collective bargaining within the statutory framework established by Act 10 as a \"represented general employee,\" and in contrast, the term \"non-represented general employee\" to refer to a general employee who has declined to participate.</p>\n<p id=\"b139-5\">B. Associational Claims</p>\n<p id=\"b139-6\">\u00b6 23. The plaintiffs' central argument on appeal is that the following provisions of Act 10 violate the associational rights of general employees and their certified representatives that are guaranteed under Article I, Sections 3 and 4 of the Wisconsin Constitution:<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>1. The provision prohibiting collective bargaining between municipal employers and the certified representatives for municipal general employee bargaining units on all subjects except base wages. Wis. Stat. \u00a7 111.70(4)(mb)l.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-5\">2. The provisions limiting negotiated base wage increases to the increase in the Consumer Price Index, unless a higher increase is approved by a municipal voter referendum.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Wis. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 66.0506, 111.70(4)(mb)2., and 118.245.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-6\">3. The provisions prohibiting fair share agreements that previously required all represented general employees to pay a proportionate share of the costs of collective bargaining and contract administration. Wis. Stat. \u00a7 111.70(l)(f) and the third sentence of Wis. Stat. \u00a7 111.70(2).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b140-8\">4. The provision prohibiting municipal employers from deducting labor organization dues from the paychecks of general employees. Wis. Stat. \u00a7 111.70(3g).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b141-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>5. The provision requiring annual recertification elections of the representatives of all bargaining units, requiring 51% of the votes of the bargaining unit members (regardless of the number of members who vote), and requiring the commission to assess costs of such elections. Wis. Stat. \u00a7 111.70(4)(d)3.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b141-4\">\u00b6 24. Whether the plaintiffs' First Amendment challenge to these provisions has any merit is the lynchpin of this appeal. The core of our review is determining whether there is a cognizable First Amendment interest, which establishes the attendant level of scrutiny applied to the legislative judgment behind the requirement. If Act 10 does not infringe on the plaintiffs' First Amendment rights, it will be upheld if any rational basis can be found for the contested provisions. <em>See Ysursa v. Pocatello Educ. Ass'n, </em>555 U.S. 353, 359 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-5\">i. Freedom of Association Doctrine</p>\n<p id=\"b141-6\">\u00b6 25. The freedom of association doctrine has two analytically distinct categories: \"intrinsic\" freedom of association, which protects certain intimate human relationships under the Substantive Due Process component of the Fourteenth Amendment, and \"instrumental\" freedom of association, which protects associations necessary to effectuate First Amendment rights. <em>See Roberts v. U.S. Jaycees, </em>468 U.S. 609, 617-18 (1984). The second category of association is the type of freedom of association right the plaintiffs assert has been infringed upon in this case. Regarding this form of association, the United States Supreme Court has \"recognized a right to associate for the purpose of engaging in those activities protected by the First Amendment\u2014 speech, assembly, petition for the redress of grievances, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>and the exercise of religion. The Constitution guarantees freedom of association of this kind as an indispensable means of preserving other individual liberties.\" <em>Roberts, </em>468 U.S. at 618; <em>see also Merrifield v. Bd. of Cnty. Comm'rs, </em>654 F.3d 1073, 1080-81 (10th Cir. 2011); <em>Weber v. City of Cedarburg, </em>129 Wis. 2d 57, 68, 384 N.W.2d 333 (1986) (noting that \"[f]reedom of association is an implied incident of the first amendment guarantees\").</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">ii. Overview of the Plaintiffs' Associational Arguments</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">\u00b6 26. The plaintiffs' argument that Act 10 violates the constitutional right of general employees and their certified representatives to freely associate is premised on a novel legal theory. Therefore, in order to properly address their arguments, we find it helpful to first outline their claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-6\">\u00b6 27. The plaintiffs begin by stressing that no contention is being made that public employees have a constitutional right to collectively bargain.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Instead, the plaintiffs argue that, while the State may statutorily restrict the obligation to collectively bargain in good faith, the State may not constitutionally withhold benefits or penalize public employees for exercising <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>their associational rights to self-organization or to select a certified representative for collective bargaining purposes.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-4\">\u00b6 28. In framing this argument, the plaintiffs rely heavily on <em>Lawson v. Housing Authority of Milwaukee, </em>270 Wis. 269, 70 N.W.2d 605 (1955). In <em>Lawson, </em>this court held that a federal housing regulation was unconstitutional because it required tenants to relinquish their right to associate with organizations designated as subversive by the United States Attorney General in order to remain eligible to continue living in federally aided housing projects. <em>Lawson, </em>270 Wis. at 288. This court concluded that a government agency could not condition the privilege of subsidized housing, which lies within the agency's discretion to grant or withhold, on the relinquishment of the constitutionally protected right to associate. <em>Id. </em>at 275.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-5\">\u00b6 29. <em>Lawson </em>is representative of a body of case law that applies the doctrine of unconstitutional conditions. This doctrine embodies the principle that freedom of speech would be rendered a hollow right if the government was permitted to place, as a condition on the receipt of a governmental benefit, any restrictions on speech it pleased. Justice Potter Stewart forcefully expressed the importance of this principle in <em>Perry v. Sindermann:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b143-6\">For at least a quarter-century, this Court has made clear that even though a person has no 'right' to a valuable governmental benefit and even though the government may deny him the benefit for any number of reasons, there are some reasons upon which the government may not rely. It may not deny a benefit to a person on a basis that infringes his constitutionally protected interests \u2014 especially, his interest in freedom of speech. For if the government could deny a benefit to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>a person because of his constitutionally protected speech or associations, his exercise of those freedoms would in effect be penalized and inhibited. This would allow the government to 'produce a result which (it) could not command directly.' <em>Speiser v. Randall, 357 </em>U.S. 513, 526 .... Such interference with constitutional rights is impermissible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">408 U.S. 593, 597 (1972); <em>see also United States v. Scott, </em>450 F.3d 863, 866 (9th Cir. 2006) (\"The 'unconstitutional conditions' doctrine . . . limits the government's ability to exact waivers of rights as a condition of benefits, even when those benefits are fully discretionary.\"); <em>Rumsfeld v. Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, Inc., </em>547 U.S. 47, 59 (2006) (\"[T]he government may not deny a benefit to a person on a basis that infringes his constitutionally protected . . . freedom of speech even if he has no entitlement to that benefit.\") (internal citations omitted). The purpose of the doctrine is to prevent the government from indirectly restricting a constitutional right that it may not otherwise directly impair.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">\u00b6 30. The plaintiffs raise two related, but allegedly distinct, arguments that, under the unconstitutional conditions doctrine, Act 10 violates their constitutional rights to freedom of association. First, the plaintiffs argue that Act 10 violates the constitutional right to freedom of association by conditioning the receipt of a \"benefit\" \u2014 here, the potential for a general employee or group of general employees to negotiate all issues with the municipal employer, including matters affecting wages and hours \u2014 on the relinquishment of the general employees' ability to choose to have a certified representative act on their behalf. Second, the plaintiffs claim that several provisions of Act 10, through cumulative effect, impose organizational and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>financial penalties on general employees who choose the statutory \"privilege\" of participating in collective bargaining for the purpose of requiring their municipal employer to bargain in good faith on base wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-4\">\u00b6 31. Regarding the second argument, the plaintiffs emphasize they are not asserting that each of the contested provisions of Act 10, standing alone, violates associational rights. Instead, the plaintiffs argue it is the impact of the contested provisions of Act 10, taken together, that creates a constitutional violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">iii. Limitations on Permissible Collective Bargaining Subjects</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">\u00b6 32. Before the enactment of Act 10, general employees were permitted under MERA to collectively bargain over a broad array of subjects, including wages, working conditions, work hours, and grievance procedures. Act 10 limits collective bargaining between municipal employers and the certified representatives of general employees to the single topic of \"total base wages and excludes any other compensation . . . .\" Wis. Stat. \u00a7 111.70(4)(mb)l. Moreover, Act 10 prohibits collective bargaining for base wage increases that exceed an increase in the Consumer Price Index unless approved in a municipal voter referendum. Wis. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 111.70(4)(mb)2., 66.0506, and 118.245.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">\u00b6 33. The plaintiffs argue this limitation penalizes general employees who choose to be represented by a certified representative because Act 10 imposes no limitations whatsoever on the terms that non-represented general employees may negotiate with their municipal employers. Consequently, the plaintiffs contend, Act 10 unconstitutionally burdens the associational rights of general employees because they must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>surrender their association with a certified representative in order to negotiate anything beyond base wages.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">\u00b6 34. The plaintiffs' argument does not withstand scrutiny. As discussed above, the plaintiffs cite to this court's holding in <em>Lawson, </em>270 Wis. 269, for the general proposition that the government may not condition the receipt of a discretionary benefit on the relinquishment of a constitutionally protected right. In essence, the plaintiffs rely on <em>Lawson </em>as an illustration of our court applying the unconstitutional conditions doctrine. Beyond <em>Lawson, </em>the plaintiffs cite to numerous cases that support the same doctrinal principle: it is impermissible for the government to condition the receipt of a tangible benefit on the relinquishment of a constitutionally protected right. <em>See, e.g., Agency for Int'l Dev. v. Alliance for Open Soc'y Int'l Inc., </em>133 S. Ct. 2321, 2328 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">\u00b6 35. We do not dispute the existence of the unconstitutional conditions doctrine or its robustness in our jurisprudence. The problem lies in the doctrine's inapplicability to this case, and consequently, the absence of support it provides the plaintiffs' argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">\u00b6 36. Comparing <em>Lawson </em>to the facts of this case swiftly illustrates the problem. In <em>Lawson, </em>this court held that it was unconstitutional for the government to condition the receipt of a benefit (living in a federally aided housing project) on the relinquishment of a constitutionally protected right (the right to associate with organizations that engage in constitutionally protected speech). Here, the plaintiffs argue that it is unconstitutional for the government, through Act 10, to condition the receipt of a benefit (to participate in collective bargaining on the lone topic of base wages) on the relinquishment of a constitutionally protected right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>(the right to associate with a certified representative in order to collectively bargain on any subject).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">\u00b6 37. The plaintiffs' logical fallacy rests in the false analogy between the resp\u00e9ctive rights being relinquished in <em>Lawson </em>and in this case. Without question, in <em>Lawson, </em>the right being relinquished for a benefit\u2014 the right to associate with organizations that engage in constitutionally protected speech \u2014 is fundamental in nature and protected under the First Amendment. Here, however, the \"right\" the plaintiffs refer to \u2014 the right to associate with a certified representative in order to collectively bargain on any subject \u2014 is categorically not a constitutional right.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-5\">\u00b6 38. General employees have no constitutional right to negotiate with their municipal employer on the lone issue of base wages, let alone on any other subject. As the United States Supreme Court made clear:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-7\">[While t]he public employee surely can associate and speak freely and petition openly, and he is protected by the First Amendment from retaliation for doing so. . . . [,] the First Amendment does not impose any affirmative obligation on the government to listen, to respond or, in this context, to recognize the association and bargain with it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-8\"><em>Smith v. Ark. State Highway Emps., Local 1315, </em>441 U.S. 463, 465 (1979) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b147-9\">\u00b6 39. The plaintiffs have insisted at every stage of litigation in this case that they are not arguing a constitutional right exists to collectively bargain. It is evident, however, that they really are, for without such a constitutional right, their challenge fails. The plaintiffs' reliance on <em>Lawson </em>hinges on the defendants conditioning the receipt of a benefit on the relinquish<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>ment of a constitutional right, but as the plaintiffs acknowledge, collective bargaining \u2014 no matter the specific statutory limitations at issue \u2014 is not constitutionally protected.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">\u00b6 40. Put differently, general employees are not being forced under Act 10 to choose between a tangible benefit and their constitutional right to associate. Instead, Act 10 provides a benefit to represented general employees by granting a statutory right to force their employer to negotiate over base wages, while non-represented general employees, who decline to collectively bargain, have no constitutional or statutory right whatsoever to force their employer to collectively bargain on any subject. For this reason, the plaintiffs' argument must be rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">\u00b6 41. This point is vital and bears repeating: the plaintiffs' associational rights are <em>in no way implicated </em>by Act 10's modifications to Wisconsin's collective bargaining framework. At issue in this case is the State's implementation of an exclusive representation system for permitting public employers and public employees to negotiate certain employment terms in good faith. It is a prerogative of a state to establish workplace policy in a non-public process in consultation with only select groups \u2014 here, an organization selected by the affected workforce itself \u2014 and not others. <em>Minn. State Bd. for Cmty. Colls. v. Knight, </em>465 U.S. 271, 286 (1984) (\"Appellees thus have no constitutional right as members of the public to a government audience for their policy views\").</p>\n<p id=\"b148-8\">\u00b6 42. Not at issue in this case is the plaintiffs' constitutional right to associate to engage in protected First Amendment activities. The plaintiffs remain free to advance <em>any </em>position, on <em>any </em>topic, either individu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>ally or in concert, through any channels that are open to the public. <em>See City of Madison v. Wis. Emp't Relations Comm'n, </em>429 U.S. 167, 175 (1976) (represented municipal employees have First Amendment right to speak \"[w]here the State has opened a forum for direct citizen involvement\"). Represented municipal employees, non-represented municipal employees, and certified representatives lose no right or ability to associate to engage in constitutionally protected speech because their ability to do so outside the framework of statutory collective bargaining is not impaired. Act 10 merely provides general employees with a statutory mechanism to force their employer to collectively bargain; outside of this narrow context, to which the plaintiffs freely concede public employees have no constitutional right, every avenue for petitioning the government remains available.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">\u00b6 43. General employees may feel inclined to collectively bargain under Act 10 in order to compel their employer to negotiate on the issue of base wages, but this creates no unconstitutional inhibition on associational freedom. <em>See, e.g., Knight, </em>465 U.S. at 289-90 (\"Appellees may well feel some pressure to join the exclusive representation in order to give them ... a voice ... on particular issues.... Such pressure is inherent in our system of government; it does not create an unconstitutional inhibition on associational freedom\"). The defendants are not barring the plaintiffs from joining any advocacy groups, limiting their ability to do so, or otherwise curtailing their ability to join other \"like-minded individuals to associate for the purpose of expressing commonly held views . . . .\" <em>Knox v. Serv. Emps. Int'l Union, Local 1000, </em>132 S. Ct. 2277, 2288 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">\u00b6 44. Thus, we conclude that the plaintiffs' reliance on <em>Lawson </em>and the unconstitutional conditions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>doctrine to be misplaced. The limitations on permissible collective bargaining subjects imposed by Act 10 do not force general employees to choose between their constitutional right to associate and the benefit of collective bargaining. Therefore, we hold that Wis. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 111.70(4)(mb), 66.0506, and 118.245 do not violate Plaintiffs' right to freedom of association.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">\u00b6 45. The dissent suggests we mischaracterize the plaintiffs' argument: \"Rather than addressing plaintiffs issue that Act 10 infringes on their constitutional right to <em>organize </em>into a collective bargaining unit, the majority erroneously asserts that plaintiffs are claiming a right to <em>bargain </em>as a collective bargaining unit.\" Dissent, \u00b6 194. In doing so, the dissent argues we \"ignore over a century's worth of jurisprudence and undermine[] a right long held sacred in our state.\" Dissent, \u00b6 199.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">\u00b6 46. This sweeping allegation is disappointing, not only because it misconstrues our analysis, but also because it shows confusion over an important area of the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">\u00b6 47. The dissent contends the actual issue presented in this case is whether Act 10 infringes on the associational rights of public employees to organize, as if collective bargaining is a peripheral matter.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Having framed the \"actual\" issue, the dissent contends employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>ees have a \"constitutional right to organize as a collective bargaining unit.\" Dissent, \u00b6 198. But for what purpose?</p>\n<p id=\"b151-4\">\u00b6 48. Without more information (ascertaining the purpose of the association), it is impossible to determine the argument's validity. The right to associate is not derived from some ethereal notion that individuals be granted the right to organize for organization's sake. Associational rights are rooted in the First Amendment's protection of freedoms of speech and assembly. <em>NAACP v. Alabama, </em>357 U.S. 449, 460 (1958). Stated differently, the right to engage in activities protected by the First Amendment drives the corresponding right to associate with others in order to engage in those activities. <em>Roberts, </em>468 U.S. at 622. Thus, the dissent's assertion that employees have an associational right to organize in a collective bargaining group is neither true nor false, because it is unclear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>whether, under the dissent's framing of the issue, the employees are associating for the purpose of engaging in a constitutionally protected activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-4\">\u00b6 49. Needless to say, this ambiguity is purposeful, because to complete the thought would necessarily reveal it is an erroneous statement of the law. The dissent knows the First Amendment does not grant state employees the constitutional right to collectively bargain with their state employer. Thus, in framing its argument, the dissent chooses to ignore that the right to associate is derived from the constitutionally protected activity the group of individuals wants to engage in. No one disputes that the plaintiffs have a constitutional right to organize with others in pursuit of a variety of political, educational, religious, or cultural ends. <em>Id. </em>But this is obviously not what the plaintiffs, or the dissent, seek to establish.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-5\">\u00b6 50. The plaintiffs seek the right to organize with others to pursue something far more specific: collective bargaining with their employer on a range of issues. And at the risk of belaboring the point, this is <em>not </em>a constitutional right. <em>Smith, </em>441 U.S. at 464-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-6\">\u00b6 51. The dissent sidesteps this fact by asserting there is a constitutional right to organize in a collective bargaining unit, but leaves unanswered whether the employees are associating for the purpose of engaging in an expressive activity accorded First Amendment protection. This approach does not imbue the plaintiffs claim with merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-7\">\u00b6 52. Of course employees have a constitutional right to organize together for expressive purposes, including for the purpose of speaking to their employer on a range of issues. As we explained, <em>supra </em>\u00b6\u00b6 42-43, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>municipal employees have the constitutional right to form groups, meet with others, organize as one, and speak on any topic. We have emphasized repeatedly that Act 10 does not prohibit any of these things. On the contrary, the State explicitly safeguards these activities.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b153-4\">\u00b6 53. It is undisputed that collective bargaining is not constitutionally protected. Indeed, Wisconsin is under no constitutional obligation to collectively bargain at all. <em>Smith, </em>441 U.S. at 464-65. But the dissent nevertheless maintains that Act 10 has so discouraged participation in Wisconsin's statutory collective bargaining process that it is unconstitutional and accuses us of dodging the question of whether Act 10 \"impermissibly punish[es] the exercise of the right to associate.\"<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> Dissent, \u00b6 207.</p>\n<p id=\"b154-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>\u00b6 54. The dissent's accusation is misplaced. Act 10 certainly presents meaningful difficulties for certified representatives, but these difficulties have no bearing on our analysis of the Act's constitutionality. The First Amendment does not require Wisconsin to \"maintain policies that allow certain associations to thrive.\" <em>Laborers Local 236 v. Walker, </em>749 F.3d 628, 639 (7th Cir. 2014). Likewise, \"[a]n organization cannot come up with an associational purpose \u2014 even a purpose that involves speech \u2014 and then require support from the state in order to realize its goal.\" <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b154-3\">iv. Fair Share Agreements, Certification Elections, and Payroll Deductions</p>\n<p id=\"b154-4\">\u00b6 55. As noted above, the plaintiffs argue that several provisions of Act 10, through cumulative effect, impose organizational and financial penalties on general employees who choose the statutory \"privilege\" of collective bargaining for the purpose of requiring their employer to negotiate in good faith on base wages. Specifically, the plaintiffs contend the following provisions of Act 10, taken together, impose a constitutionally impermissible burden on general employees: (1) the prohibition of fair share agreements; (2) the requirement of mandatory annual certification elections; and (3) the prohibition on payroll deductions of labor organization dues from the wages of general employees. The plaintiffs argue these features of Act 10 unconstitutionally interfere with associational rights by burdening and penalizing general employees who elect to collectively bargain. The plaintiffs claim that general employees will eventually surrender the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>exercise of their associational rights rather than suffer the burdens placed upon them.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-4\">\u00b6 56. The plaintiffs cite to no authority supporting their contention that constitutional analysis functions in this manner; i.e., that courts must consider several, otherwise constitutional, statutory provisions to determine if they collectively amount to a constitutional infirmity. Nevertheless, we indulge the plaintiffs in this instance and separately consider the constitutionality of Act 10's \"cumulative impact and effect.\" We first examine each contested provision in isolation. After assessing each challenged part, we examine the contested provisions operating as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b155-5\">a. Fair Share Agreements</p>\n<p id=\"b155-6\">\u00b6 57. Fair share agreements are negotiated arrangements between municipal employers and certified representatives that require all general employees, including non-represented general employees, to pay the proportional share of the cost of collective bargaining and contract administration. Act 10 prohibits these agreements. <em>See </em>Wis. Stat. \u00a7 111.70(l)(f), (2). The plaintiffs argue this creates a financial burden on certified representatives and represented general employees to bear the full cost of collective bargaining for the benefit of the entire bargaining unit, while allowing non-represented general employees in the bargaining unit to enjoy the benefits of representation as \"free riders.\" For the certified representative and its members to choose the statutory \"privilege\" of collective bargaining, the plaintiffs argue they must accept the financial penalty as a condition of their associational choices to serve as the certified representative and be represented <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>general employees. The plaintiffs contend these burdens will dissuade labor organizations from becoming certified representatives and general employees from becoming represented general employees, and are therefore unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-4\">\u00b6 58. The plaintiffs' argument is unconvincing. First, labor organizations \"have no constitutional entitlement to the fees of nonmember-employees.\" <em>Davenport v. Wash. Educ. Ass'n, </em>551 U.S. 177, 185 (2007). Further, as the United States Supreme Court recently reaffirmed in <em>Harris v. Quinn, </em>fair share agreements \"unquestionably impose a heavy burden on the First Amendment interests\" of municipal employees who do not wish to participate in the collective bargaining process. <em>Harris v. Quinn, </em>573 U.S. _, 134 S. Ct. 2618, 2643 (2014); <em>see also Knox, </em>132 S. Ct. at 2291 (\"By authorizing a union to collect fees from nonmembers... our prior decisions approach, if they do not cross, the limit of what the First Amendment can tolerate\").<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b156-8\">\u00b6 59. Even setting aside the question of whether fair share agreements are constitutionally permis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>sible,<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> it is evident that the prohibition of fair share agreements does not infringe on the associational rights of general employees or certified representatives in any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"48\">*48</page-number>respect. The First Amendment does not compel the government to subsidize speech. <em>Ysursa, </em>555 U.S. at 357. By logical extension, the First Amendment does not compel the government to compel its employees to subsidize speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-3\">\u00b6 60. The plaintiffs' argument that the financial cost involved in participating in collective bargaining acts as an unconstitutional \"burden\" on general employees and certified representatives is premised on a faulty assumption: if the State creates a benefit for which there is no constitutional right, it will nevertheless violate the First Amendment rights of those who accept that benefit if accepting that benefit somehow \"burdens\" a non-constitutionally protected activity. A successful constitutional challenge cannot be rooted in such an unfounded premise.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-4\">\u00b6 61. We conclude that Wis. Stat. \u00a7 111.70(l)(f) and the third sentence of \u00a7 111.70(2), examined in isolation, do not violate the plaintiffs' right to freedom of association.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-5\">b. Certification Elections</p>\n<p id=\"b158-6\">\u00b6 62. Prior to Act 10, general employees could petition WERC to hold an election to designate a labor organization as the general employees' certified representative. The voting requirement for certification was a simple majority of employees in the collective bargaining unit. Once a labor organization was certified, it would remain the general employees' certified representative until thirty percent of the employees requested a decertification election.</p>\n<p id=\"b158-7\">\u00b6 63. Act 10, however, requires the certified representative of a collective bargaining unit to undergo an annual certification election in which the representa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"49\">*49</page-number>tive must obtain the vote of an absolute majority of the general employees in the bargaining unit to retain status as the employees' certified representative. Wis. Stat. \u00a7 111.70(4)(d)3.b. Further, Act 10 requires that the certified representative pay the cost of administering the related certification elections. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b159-4\">\u00b6 64. The plaintiffs allege that the certification election requirements imposed by Act 10 place \"organizational penalties\" on certified representatives and general employees that will eventually dissuade participation in collective bargaining.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-5\">\u00b6 65. The plaintiffs' argument again conflates collective bargaining rights, which are statutorily guaranteed, with associational rights, which are constitutionally protected. Act 10's certification election provisions merely specify the statutory requirements a certified representative must satisfy in order to exclusively negotiate on behalf of the general employees in its bargaining unit. No plausible argument can be made that these provisions, or the \"burdens\" they impose on certified representatives, infringe on the rights of general employees to freely associate. The certification election provisions do not bar or obstruct general employees from joining other \"like-minded individuals to associate for the purpose of expressing commonly held views.\" <em>Knox, </em>132 S. Ct. at 2288. Instead, the provisions at issue outline the requirements and rights of certified representatives that wish to, on behalf of its bargaining unit employees, compel the government to participate in statutory collective bargaining.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-7\">\u00b6 66. Certification requirements for certified representatives have existed in Wisconsin's labor laws <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"50\">*50</page-number>since 1959.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The certification requirements imposed by Act 10 are certainly more stringent than under the prior laws, but it is impossible for these increased \"organizational penalties\" to violate the plaintiffs' associational rights, when there are no associational rights at stake. The certification requirements apply solely to collective bargaining, which is wholly distinct from an individual's constitutional right to associate. Therefore, we hold that Wis. Stat. \u00a7 111.70(4)(d)3.b., examined in isolation, does not infringe on the plaintiffs' constitutional right to associate.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-4\">c. Payroll Deductions</p>\n<p id=\"b160-5\">\u00b6 67. Prior to Act 10, municipal employers could deduct labor organization dues from the paychecks of general employees at the employee's request. Act 10 prohibits this practice. Wis. Stat. \u00a7 111.70(3g). The plaintiffs argue this prohibition hampers certified representatives and general employees both organizationally and financially, creating an unconstitutional burden on their associational rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b160-7\">\u00b6 68. The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit recently considered a separate legal challenge to Act 10 and, in so doing, examined the constitutionality of Act Act 10's prohibition on payroll deductions for labor organizations. The court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>The Bill of Rights enshrines negative liberties. It directs what government may not do to its citizens, rather than what it must do for them. While the First Amendment prohibits \"placing] obstacles in the path\" of speech ... nothing requires government to \"assist others in funding the expression of particular ideas, including political ones,\" <em>Ysursa, 555 </em>U.S. at 358, 129 S.Ct. 1093.... Thus, even though \"publicly administered payroll deductions for political purposes can enhance the unions' exercise of First Amendment rights, [states are] under no obligation to aid the unions in their political activities.\" <em>Ysursa, 555 </em>U.S. at 359, 129 S.Ct. 1093.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b161-4\">In <em>Ysursa, </em>the Supreme Court squarely held that the use of a state payroll system to collect union dues from public sector employees is a state subsidy of speech. <em>Id. </em>As the Court explained, \"the State's decision not to [allow payroll deduction of union dues] is not an abridgment of the unions' speech; they are free to engage in such speech as they see fit.\"... Like the statutes in these cases, Act 10 places no limitations on the speech of general employee unions, which may continue speaking on any topic or subject.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b161-6\"><em>Wis. Educ. Ass'n Council v. Walker, </em>705 F.3d 640, 645-46 (7th Cir. 2013). While the Seventh Circuit's analysis of Act 10 is not binding on this court, we find no reason to disagree with its clear and rational articulation of the law.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> As explained by the Seventh Circuit, the prohibi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>tion on an employer's authorization to deduct labor organization dues from the paychecks of general employees does not infringe on an employee's constitutional right to associate. Further, this prohibition does not penalize employees because no constitutional right exists for the deduction of dues from a paycheck to support membership in a voluntary organization. <em>See Bailey v. Callaghan, </em>715 F.3d 956, 958 (6th Cir. 2013) (noting the prohibition on payroll deductions \"does not restrict the unions' speech at all: they remain free to speak about whatever they wish. Moreover, nothing in the First Amendment prevents a State from determining that its political subdivisions may not provide payroll deductions for union activities ....\") (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b162-4\">\u00b6 69. Accordingly, we hold that Wis. Stat. \u00a7 111.70(3g), examined in isolation, does not infringe on the plaintiffs' constitutional right to associate.</p>\n<p id=\"b162-5\">d. Cumulative Burden</p>\n<p id=\"b162-6\">\u00b6 70. We have held that, examined in isolation, each of the contested provisions of Act 10 does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"53\">*53</page-number>violate the plaintiffs' associational rights. While we do not concede that the cumulative approach advocated by the plaintiffs is either correct or necessary, we now conclude that, even viewed together, the contested provisions of Act 10 are not constitutionally infirm. As we discussed above, each provision of Act 10 that the plaintiffs contend infringes upon the associational rights of certified representatives and general employees does not, in fact, do so, because in each instance, there is no constitutional associational right implicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-4\">\u00b6 71. Viewing the provisions as a whole does not change our analysis. Each of the plaintiffs' arguments fails for largely the same reason: collective bargaining requires the municipal employer and the certified representative to meet and confer in good faith. Wis. Stat. \u00a7 111.70(l)(a). The Wisconsin Constitution does not. Indeed, it is uncontested that it would be constitutional for the State of Wisconsin to eliminate collective bargaining entirely.</p>\n<p id=\"b163-5\">\u00b6 72. Thus, the plaintiffs' contention that several provisions of Act 10, which delineate the rights, obligations, and procedures of collective bargaining, infringe upon general employees' constitutional right to freedom of association is unfounded. No matter the limitations or \"burdens\" a legislative enactment places on the collective bargaining process, collective bargaining remains a creation of legislative grace and not constitutional obligation. The restrictions attached to the statutory scheme of collective bargaining are irrelevant in regards to freedom of association because no condition is being placed on the decision to participate. If a general employee participates in collective bargaining under Act 10's statutory framework, that general em<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"54\">*54</page-number>ployee has not relinquished a constitutional right. They have only acquired a benefit to which they were never constitutionally entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-4\">\u00b6 73. The First Amendment cannot be used as a vehicle to expand the parameters of a benefit that it does not itself protect. For the reasons articulated above, we conclude that Wis. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 111.70(4)(mb), 66.0506, 118.245, 111.70(l)(f), 111.70(3g), 111.70(4)(d)3 and the third sentence of \u00a7 111.70(2) do not violate the plaintiffs' associational rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-6\">C. Equal Protection</p>\n<p id=\"b164-7\">\u00b6 74. Having concluded that Act 10 does not violate the right to freedom of association under the First Amendment, we next consider whether the Act offends the equal protection provisions of the Wisconsin or United States Constitutions.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The plaintiffs also argue that Act 10 violates the equal protection rights of general employees and certified representatives through the disparate treatment of general employees <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"55\">*55</page-number>who choose to associate with a certified representative and general employees who do not. In considering this argument, we first note that public employees are not a protected class. We also recognize that this challenge implicates no fundamental rights because, as explained above, the right to collectively bargain is not the same as the plaintiffs' constitutional right to freedom of association. Accordingly, rational basis review governs in our examination of the plaintiffs' equal protection claims.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> We uphold a legislative act under that standard if it furthers a legitimate interest and if the challenged classification is rationally related to achieving the interest. <em>See Smith, </em>323 Wis. 2d 377, \u00b6 12 (\"When neither a fundamental right has been interfered with nor a suspect class been disadvantaged as a result of the classification, the legislative enactment must be sustained unless it is patently arbitrary and bears no rational relationship to a legitimate government interest.\") (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b165-4\">\u00b6 75. As the court of appeals observed, and the plaintiffs concede, the merit of the plaintiffs' equal protection argument hinges on the merit of their associational rights claim. Having rejected the premise that Act 10 implicates a fundamental right, the plaintiffs' equal protection claim necessarily fails under rational basis review.</p>\n<p id=\"b166-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"56\">*56</page-number>\u00b6 76. While courts express various iterations of the rational basis test, we have often quoted the United States Supreme Court's articulation in <em>McGowan v. Maryland, </em>366 U.S. 420, 425-26 (1961):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b166-4\">[The Equal Protection Clause] permits the States a wide scope of discretion in enacting laws which affect some groups of citizens differently than others. The constitutional safeguard is offended only if the classification rests on grounds wholly irrelevant to the achievement of the State's objective. State legislatures are presumed to have acted within their constitutional power despite the fact that, in practice, their laws result in some inequality. A statutory discrimination will not be set aside if any state of facts reasonably may be conceived to justify it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b166-5\">This court's presumption that all legislative acts are constitutional places a heavy burden on a party challenging the statute's constitutionality under rational basis review. <em>See Ferdon ex rel. Petrucelli v. Wisconsin Patients Comp. Fund, </em>2005 WI 125, \u00b6\u00b6 67-68, 284 Wis. 2d 573, 701 N.W.2d 440. If any doubt exists as to the statute's constitutionality, it must be resolved in favor of constitutionality. <em>Id. </em>To prevail, a challenger must establish that the law is unconstitutional beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b166-6\">\u00b6 77. We will uphold a statute against an equal protection challenge if the classification bears a rational relationship to some legitimate government interest. <em>Smith, </em>323 Wis. 2d 377, \u00b6 12. Notably, this requires no declaration by the State about the law's purpose, nor evidence supporting the law's rationality. The actual motivations of the enacting governmental body are irrelevant. <em>FCC v. Beach Communications, </em>508 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>307, 315 (1993). Instead, \"[i]n evaluating whether a legislative classification rationally advances the legislative objective, 'we are obligated to locate or, in the alternative, construct a rationale that might have influenced the legislative determination.'\" <em>Ferdon, </em>284 Wis. 2d 573, \u00b6 74 (citing <em>Aicher ex rel. LaBarge v. Wisconsin Patients Comp. Fund, </em>2000 WI 98, \u00b6 57, 237 Wis. 2d 99, N.W.2d 849).</p>\n<p id=\"b167-4\">\u00b6 78. The plaintiffs' equal protection argument focuses on two distinct ways in which employees are disparately treated: first, under Act 10, general employees who choose to associate with a certified representative are limited to negotiating on the sole issue of base wages. General employees who do not associate with a certified representative, however, face no limitations on what they may negotiate with their employer. Second, Act 10 prohibits municipal employers from deducting labor organization dues from the paychecks of general employees who choose to associate with a certified representative. General employees that belong to other organizations, however, face no similar prohibition in having membership dues from those organizations deducted from their paychecks.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-5\">\u00b6 79. We will address each challenged classification in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b167-6\">i. Collective Bargaining Limitations</p>\n<p id=\"b167-7\">\u00b6 80. The plaintiffs argue that Act 10 violates general employees' rights to equal protection under the law because the law limits represented general employees to negotiating base wages, while non-represented general employees have no limitations in what they may negotiate with their employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>\u00b6 81. The fact that Act 10 creates two classes of public employees by whether they elect to have a certified representative for collective bargaining purposes denies no employee equal protection under the law. As the defendants accurately point out, if the plaintiffs were correct in their argument, <em>any </em>public sector bargaining framework that resulted in different treatment for represented and non-represented general employees would be unconstitutional. This means if the plaintiffs' equal protection argument were correct, any collective bargaining scheme would be constitutionally infirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-5\">\u00b6 82. Legislative acts must be upheld when this court can conceive of any facts upon which the legislation reasonably could be based. <em>Aicher, </em>237 Wis. 2d 99, \u00b6 66. The Seventh Circuit determined, and we agree: Act 10's requirement that base wage increases above the cost of living require a municipal voter referendum for certified bargaining agents \"promote flexibility in state and local government budgets by providing public employers more leverage in negotiations.\" <em>Wis. Educ. Ass'n Council, </em>705 F.3d at 654. We conclude this classification scheme rationally advances the legislative purpose of improving Wisconsin's fiscal health through enhanced control over public expenditures.</p>\n<p id=\"b168-7\">ii. Payroll Deduction Prohibitions</p>\n<p id=\"b168-8\">\u00b6 83. The plaintiffs also argue that Act 10 violates general employees' rights to equal protection under the law because the law prohibits employers from deducting labor organization dues from the paychecks of general employees, while permitting employers to deduct membership dues for other organizations.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number>\u00b6 84. As we noted above, because Act 10's payroll deduction prohibition does not implicate the plaintiffs' associational rights, we examine this provision of Act 10 under rational basis review.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-4\">\u00b6 85. Act 10's prohibition on deducting labor organization dues could be founded on the defendants' rational belief that labor organizations are costly for the State. The State has a legitimate interest, especially in the current economic climate, in curtailing costs where possible. The prohibition on paycheck deductions furthers this interest by imposing a burden that affects the influence of labor organizations over general employees who are less enthusiastic about participating in the collective bargaining process. <em>See Wis. Educ. Ass'n Council, </em>705 F.3d at 656-57. This provision of Act 10 does not prohibit general employees from paying labor organization dues; it merely requires that employees show the initiative to pay them on their own.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-6\">\u00b6 86. Accordingly, we conclude Act 10's collective bargaining limitations and payroll deduction prohibitions survive the plaintiffs' equal protection challenge under rational basis review.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-7\">D.

The plaintiffs<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> argue that Wis. Stat. \u00a7 62.623 violates the \"home rule amendment,\" Wis. Const, art. XI, \u00a7 3(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>\u00b6 89. Cities are creatures of the state legislature and have no inherent right of self-government beyond the powers expressly granted to them.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Van Gilder v. City of Madison, </em>222 Wis. 58, 73, 268 N.W 108 (1936) (citing <em>City of Trenton v. New Jersey, </em>262 U.S. 182, 187 (1923)). Adopted in 1924, the home rule amendment was intended to provide cities and villages<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"63\">*63</page-number>greater autonomy over local affairs.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The home rule amendment, Wis. Const, art. XI, \u00a7 3(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-4\">Cities and villages organized pursuant to state law may determine their local affairs and government, subject only to this constitution and to such enactments of the legislature of statewide concern as with uniformity shall affect every city or every village. The method of such determination shall be prescribed by the legislature.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">\u00b6 90. As the court of appeals noted in its certification to this court, the crux of this challenge lies in the parties' disagreement on the proper legal test to employ in determining whether a legislative enactment violates the home rule amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">\u00b6 91. The defendants argue that our case law holds, as a threshold matter, that if a legislative enactment applies uniformly statewide, it cannot violate the home rule amendment. In other words, the defendants contend the determination of whether a legislative enactment is primarily a statewide or local concern is irrelevant, so long as the legislation \"with uniformity shall affect every city or village.\" Wis. Const, art. XI, \u00a7 3(1).<footnotemark>28</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b174-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>\u00b6 92. In stark contrast to the defendants' position, the plaintiffs contend that, in order to comply with the home rule amendment, a legislative enactment must (1) affect a matter of statewide concern, <em>and </em>must (2) apply with uniformity statewide. Further, the plaintiffs argue that if a home rule municipality has enacted a charter ordinance that relates to a matter of purely local concern, any conflicting state statute must be found unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-4\">\u00b6 93. In short, the parties dispute whether a uniformly applied state law may permissibly preempt the charter ordinance of a home-rule city if the ordinance concerns a matter of purely local affairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">\u00b6 94. Generally, under our analytical framework for home rule challenges, we first establish the character of the legislative enactment at issue, and only then consider whether the uniformity requirement is satisfied if the state law concerns a matter of primarily local affairs. However, this home rule challenge is atypical because the heart of the parties' dispute is not limited to the application of the relevant law to the facts presented; instead, it centers on the parties' wildly divergent positions on the applicable analytical framework. In their certification to this court, the court of appeals requested that we clarify the proper legal test to apply in constitutional home rule challenges.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">\u00b6 95. In order to address the court of appeals' request for clarity and resolve the parties' arguments, we first outline the relevant analytical framework. In so doing, we establish that, under our controlling precedent, no merit exists in the plaintiffs' contention that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>the legislative enactment at issue in a home rule challenge must be a matter of statewide concern and uniformly applied statewide to withstand constitutional scrutiny. After clarifying the proper analytical framework, we apply it to the facts of this case and hold that Wis. Stat. \u00a7 62.623 primarily concerns a matter of statewide concern and does not violate the home rule amendment to the Wisconsin Constitution. Accordingly, we need not go any further to conclude that Wis. Stat. \u00a7 62.623 survives the plaintiffs' home rule challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\">i. Analytical Framework</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">\u00b6 96. For the purposes of our home rule analysis, we have outlined three areas of legislative enactment: those that are (1) exclusively a statewide concern; (2) exclusively a local concern; or (3) a \"mixed bag.\" <em>See, e.g., Adams v. State Livestock Facilities Siting Review Bd., </em>2012 WI 85, \u00b6 30, 342 Wis. 2d 444, 820 N.W.2d 404 (citing <em>State ex rel. Michalek v. LeGrand, </em>77 Wis. 2d 520, 527, 253 N.W.2d 505 (1977)).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">\u00b6 97. If the legislative enactment concerns a policy matter that is exclusively of statewide concern, we have held that the home rule amendment grants no city or village authority to regulate the matter. <em>Van Gilder, </em>222 Wis. at 84 (holding that \"[w]hen the Legislature deals with matters which are primarily matters of state-wide concern, it may deal with them free from any restriction contained in the home rule amendment\").<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">\u00b6 98. Conversely, if the legislative enactment concerns a matter of purely local affairs, home rule munici<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>palities may regulate those local matters and, under the home rule amendment, state legislation that would preempt or make that municipal regulation unlawful, unless uniformly applied statewide, is prohibited. <em>Michalek, </em>77 Wis. 2d at 529 (holding that \"[a]s to an area solely or paramountly in the constitutionally protected area of 'local affairs and government,' the state legislature's . . . preemption or ban on local legislative action would be unconstitutional\").</p>\n<p id=\"b176-3\">\u00b6 99. However, notwithstanding the plaintiffs' assertions to the contrary, our case law has consistently held that the legislature may still enact legislation that is under the home rule authority of a city or village if it with uniformity \"affect[s] every city or every village.\" Wis. Const, art. XI, \u00a7 3(1); <em>see, e.g., Adams, </em>342 Wis. 2d 444, \u00b6\u00b6 29, 36 (noting that, while municipalities may adopt ordinances regulating issues of both statewide and local concern, the legislature has the authority to withdraw this power by creating uniform state standards that all political subdivisions must follow); <em>City of West Allis v. Cnty. of Milwaukee, </em>39 Wis. 2d 356, 366, 159 N.W.2d 36 (1968) (explaining that when \"the matter enacted by the legislature is primarily of local concern, a municipality can escape the strictures of the legislative enactment unless the enactment applies with uniformity to every city and village.\"); <em>Van Gilder, </em>222 Wis. at 84 (stating that \"when the Legislature deals with local affairs and government of a city, if its act is not to be subordinate to a charter ordinance, the act must be one which affects with uniformity every city\"); <em>State v. Baxter, </em>195 Wis. 437, 449, 219 N.W. 858 (1928) (explain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>ing that \"where legislation of a city enacted within the scope of its home rule powers comes in conflict with state legislation, the legislation of the city prevails over the state legislation, unless the state legislation affects uniformly every city of the state\"). If the state legislation concerning purely local affairs does not meet the uniformity requirement, cities and villages may exempt themselves from the law by adopting a charter ordinance to that effect. <em>See West Allis, </em>39 Wis. 2d at 367-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-4\">\u00b6 100. Finally, in cases where the legislative enactment touches on an issue that concerns both statewide and local government interests (a \"mixed bag\"), the court must first determine whether the matter is primarily a matter of statewide or local concern. After making this determination, the court then applies the corresponding test. <em>See, e.g., Michalek, </em>77 Wis. 2d at 528 (concluding the matter at issue was paramountly local in nature and, accordingly, treating it as being of local concern for purposes of home rule analysis); <em>State ex rel. Brelsford v. Ret. Bd. of Policemen's Annuity &amp; Benefit Fund of Milwaukee, </em>41 Wis. 2d 77, 86, 163 N.W.2d 153 (1968) (citation omitted) (reviewing the consistency of two home rule cases and noting \"the court was confronted with a subject of legislation which partook both of the nature of a 'local affair' and also that of 'state-wide concern,' but in the former case it held that the matter was primarily a 'local affair,' while the latter decision held that the 'state-wide concern' feature was paramount.\"); <em>City of Fond du Lac v. Town of Empire, </em>273 Wis. 333, 338-39, 77 N.W.2d 699 (1956) (explaining that \"where a matter affects the interests of local residents as well as the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>interests of the people in other areas of the state, the test to be applied in resolving the matter is that of paramount interest. . . .\").</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">\u00b6 101. In sum, our home rule case law instructs us that, when reviewing a legislative enactment under the home rule amendment, we apply a two-step analysis. First, as a threshold matter, the court determines whether the statute concerns a matter of primarily statewide or primarily local concern. If the statute concerns a matter of primarily statewide interest, the home rule amendment is not implicated and our analysis ends. If, however, the statute concerns a matter of primarily local affairs, the reviewing court then examines whether the statute satisfies the uniformity requirement. If the statute does not, it violates the home rule amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-6\">ii. The Plaintiffs' Local Affairs Argument</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">\u00b6 102. The plaintiffs, against the great weight of our precedent, broadly depict the home rule amendment as prohibiting the State from enacting any legislation that preempts the charter ordinance of a home-rule city when the ordinance concerns a matter of exclusively local affairs. To support this claim, the plaintiffs rely on this court's holdings in <em>Michalek, </em>77 Wis. 2d 520, and <em>Thompson v. Kenosha Cnty., </em>64 Wis. 2d 673, 221 N.W.2d 845 (1974).<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b179-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>\u00b6 103. The plaintiffs interpret <em>Michalek </em>to hold that legislation purporting to preempt a charter ordinance that concerns a matter of local affairs violates the home rule amendment. In <em>Michalek, </em>this court upheld a City of Milwaukee rent-withholding charter ordinance, concluding the ordinance primarily concerned a matter of local affairs. <em>Michalek, </em>77 Wis. 2d at 529, 536. In discussing the reach of the home rule amendment, the court stated that \"[a]s to an area solely or paramountly in the constitutionally protected area of 'local affairs and government,' the state legislature's delegation of authority to legislate is unnecessary and its preemption or ban on local legislative action would be unconstitutional.\" <em>Id. </em>at 529.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-4\">\u00b6 104. Relying on this isolated passage, the plaintiffs construe <em>Michalek </em>to hold that state legislation can never preempt a municipal charter ordinance regulating issues of purely local affairs, regardless of whether the legislation applies uniformly statewide.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\">\u00b6 105. The plaintiffs' reading of <em>Michalek </em>ignores the fact, however, that the court held the charter ordinance and state legislation at issue did not actually conflict with one another.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> Therefore, though <em>Michalek </em>determined the charter ordinance concerned a matter of primarily local affairs, the court did not need to reach the question of whether the contested state legislation satisfied the uniformity requirement of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>the home rule amendment. In fact, the court in <em>Michalek </em>clarified this very point:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b180-3\">With no conflict between ordinance and statute, and no potential for conflict, we do not give consideration to the undiscussed question whether the home rule amendment reference to \"enactments of legislative and state-wide concern as shall with uniformity affect every city and every village,\" (Art. XI, sec. 3, Wis.Const.) includes or does not include a statute applying only to counties with over 100,000 population.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b180-4\"><em>Michalek, </em>77 Wis. 2d at 530 n.16. Put differently, <em>Michalek </em>makes plain that if the court had reached a different conclusion and found the legislation and charter ordinance did, in fact, conflict, the court would have proceeded by examining whether the statute applied uniformly statewide. Read in this context, <em>Michalek </em>does not hold that state legislation that conflicts with a charter ordinance concerning a matter of local affairs is per se unconstitutional. The plaintiffs' assertion that <em>Michalek </em>supports such a proposition is entirely misplaced. <em>Michalek </em>is in accord with this court's long-held rule that when the charter ordinance of a home rule city concerns a matter of local affairs, conflicting legislation must be uniformly applied statewide to satisfy the home rule amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">\u00b6 106. The plaintiffs' reliance on <em>Thompson </em>hinges on the following language: \"Sec. 3, art. XI of the constitution places two limitations on the legislature's power to enact statutes interfering with city and village affairs: (1) The subject of the statutes must be a matter of statewide concern; and (2) such statutes must uniformly affect all cities and villages.\" <em>Thompson, </em>64 Wis. 2d at 683. The plaintiffs argue that this explicit statement that two limitations exist\u2014 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>statewide concern <em>and </em>uniformity \u2014 demonstrates that the uniformity of legislation, alone, does not satisfy the home rule amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-4\">\u00b6 107. We acknowledge the language that the plaintiffs highlight in <em>Thompson </em>appears, at first blush, to conflict with this court's prior interpretations of the home rule amendment. However, a close reading reveals that the implied rule in <em>Thompson </em>cited to by the plaintiffs \u2014 that, in matters concerning local affairs, the home rule amendment requires state legislation to concern a matter of statewide concern and be uniformly applied statewide \u2014 is never employed by the <em>Thompson </em>court and is, in fact, internally inconsistent with the court's own analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b181-5\">\u00b6 108. In <em>Thompson, </em>we examined a challenge to a state statute that permitted counties to create a county assessor system. <em>Id. </em>at 676. Specifically, the challengers argued that the statute violated the home rule amendment because it impermissibly superseded the assessment powers of cities, villages, and towns within such counties. <em>Id. </em>at 682-83. After setting out the language emphasized by the plaintiffs in this case, the <em>Thompson </em>court then considered whether the state law at issue violated the home rule amendment. First, the court determined that the subject matter of the legislation, which dealt with property tax assessments, was primarily a statewide concern. <em>Id. </em>at 686. Subsequently, in considering the uniformity requirement, the <em>Thompson </em>court noted:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-6\"><em>th[e] uniformity limitation only applies if the subject of the statute concerns primarily local affairs. </em>If the subject of the legislation is of statewide concern, the uniformity restriction is inapplicable.. . . Since we have concluded that the subject of [the state law at issue] was primarily a matter of statewide concern, the uni<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>formity requirement of the home rule amendment is not applicable here. ... Thus, <em>even if [the state law at issue] concerns local affairs, and must therefore affect cities and villages uniformly, we hold that this uniformity requirement is not violated.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b182-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 686-87 (emphasis added). Thus, <em>Thompson </em>held that, even had the court decided the state law at issue concerned a matter of local affairs rather than a statewide concern, the statute would still be upheld because it \"applie[d] with equal force throughout the state.\" <em>Id. </em>at 688. We find it significant that the reasoning and holding in <em>Thompson </em>read as a whole, unlike the isolated passage relied upon by the plaintiffs, harmonizes with controlling precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-5\">\u00b6 109. The reasoning and holdings of <em>Thompson </em>and <em>Michalek </em>are consistent with the entire body of our longstanding home rule jurisprudence and we find no conflict in our precedent to be resolved.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Consequently, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>we perceive no merit in the plaintiffs' broad characterization of the legislative power conferred to municipalities by the home rule amendment. Instead, we reaffirm that, while the home rule amendment authorizes municipal regulation over matters of local concern and protects that regulation against conflicting state law, state law will still preempt that municipal regulation if it \"with uniformity.. . affect[s] every city or every village.\" Wis. Const, art. XI, \u00a7 3(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">\u00b6 110. Having reaffirmed our established analytical framework for home rule amendment challenges, we now apply that framework to the legislative enactment at issue, Wis. Stat. \u00a7 62.623.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">iii. Statewide or Local Concern</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">\u00b6 111. We first address whether Wis. Stat. \u00a7 62.623 concerns a matter of exclusively statewide concern, exclusively local affairs, or a mix of both statewide and local interests. The defendants argue that Wis. Stat. \u00a7 62.623 addresses a matter of statewide concern. Specifically, the defendants contend that the legislature, in enacting Act 10, clearly believed that the entire State of Wisconsin \u2014 including its municipalities \u2014was in a financial crisis. In order to effectively respond to this crisis, the legislature deemed it essential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>to lower the costs associated with public employees statewide. Further, the defendants cite to the State's \"shared revenue\" program and other state aid provided to counties and municipalities to bolster the argument that local spending is an issue of statewide concern.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">\u00b6 112. The plaintiffs, on the other hand, argue that Wis. Stat. \u00a7 62.623, by prohibiting the City of Milwaukee and participating city agencies from paying the employee share of contributions to the Milwaukee ERS, unconstitutionally infringes on a matter of purely local concern. Both the plaintiffs and the dissent<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> cite to <em>Van Gilder </em>for the proposition that issues tied to a municipality's local spending powers \u2014 here, the City of Milwaukee's administration of its own retirement system \u2014 is quintessentially a local affair. 222 Wis. at 81-82 (quoting J. Cardozo in <em>Adler v. Deegan, </em>167 N.E. 705, 713 (1929)) (\"There are some affairs intimately connected with the exercise by the city of its corporate functions, which are city affairs only .... Most impor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>tant of all perhaps is the control of the locality over payments from the local purse\").</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">\u00b6 113. This court has long recognized that the terms \"local affairs\" and \"statewide concern\" in the home rule amendment are problematically vague. <em>See, e.g., Van Gilder, </em>222 Wis. at 73 (observing that the phrases \"local affairs\" and \"statewide concern\" are \"practically indefinable\"). Further, the terms \"local affairs\" and \"statewide concern\" carry the risk of oversimplifying reality: the \"functions of state and local governments necessarily overlap,\" <em>Van Gilder, </em>222 Wis. at 64, and, moreover, the nature of governmental functions can change over time.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark> Consequently, home rule challenges are, by necessity, fact-specific inquiries, and determinations are made on an ad hoc basis. <em>See, e.g., California Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n. v. City of Los Angeles, </em>812 P.2d 916, 925 (Cal. 1991) (noting that a \"municipal affair\" and \"statewide concern\" represent \"legal conclusions rather than factual descriptions\").</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">\u00b6 114. Here, the public policy matter at issue unquestionably touches on matters of both statewide and local concern. The administration of a city's retirement system, entirely self-reliant in both its management and funding, certainly concerns a matter of local affairs. As the plaintiffs correctly observe, the regulation of local budgetary policy and spending have long been considered matters of purely local concern. <em>See, e.g., Van Gilder, </em>222 Wis. 58. Further, the enactment of Act 10 negatively impacts the City of Milwaukee's sensible interest in offering greater employee benefits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>in order to attract personnel. In fact, the initial legislative purpose in authorizing the establishment of the Milwaukee ERS was to \"strengthen the public service in cities of the first class by establishing the security of such retirement benefits.\" \u00a7 31(1), ch. 441, Laws of 1947.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-3\">\u00b6 115. Conversely, the statewide regulation of public sector employee expenditures during a period of economic recession unquestionably involves a matter of statewide importance. The terms of the public employer-employee relationship have long been the subject of statewide legislation in Wisconsin. In fact, Wisconsin was the first state in the nation to establish a framework for public employees to engage in collective bargaining.<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> Since that time, the state legislature has enacted numerous statutes dealing with a broad range of issues relating to the public employer-employee relationship. <em>See, e.g., </em>Wis. Stat. \u00a7 111.01 (governing standards regarding employment peace); Wis. Stat. \u00a7 111.321-325 (prohibiting employment discrimination); Wis. Stat. \u00a7 111.70 (governing statewide collective bargaining framework); Wis. Stat. ch. 230 (establishing civil service protections for state employees). Further, statewide legislation aimed at improving the fiscal health of the state budget is indisputably a general state concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">\u00b6 116. Having concluded the conflict between Wis. Stat. \u00a7 62.623 and the Milwaukee Charter Ordinance implicates both statewide and local concerns, we apply the \"test of paramountcy.\" As explained <em>supra </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>\u00b6 100, when a challenged legislative enactment impacts both statewide and local interests, we must determine whether the legislation \"is primarily or paramountly a matter of 'local affairs and government' under the home rule amendment or of 'state-wide concern' under the exception thereto . . <em>.Michalek, </em>77 Wis. 2d at 528.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\">\u00b6 117. Our home rule jurisprudence instructs this court, in confronting the \"heavy burden of developing the lines\" between matters of statewide and local concern, to consider whether the conflict between the charter ordinance and the statute at issue more greatly concerns the people of the entire state or the people in the municipality.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Michalek, </em>77 Wis. 2d at 527 (noting \"that many matters while of 'state-wide concern,' 'affecting the people and state at large somewhat remotely and indirectly, yet at the same time affect the individual municipalities directly and intimately, can consistently be, and are, 'local affairs'. . . .'\") (quoting <em>State ex rel. Ekern v. City of Milwaukee, </em>190 Wis. 633, 640, 290 N.W. 860 (1926)); <em>Brelsford, </em>41 Wis. 2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>86-87 (reasoning that a charter ordinance regarding the regulation of pension benefits for Milwaukee police officers who teach upon retirement is of more interest to Milwaukee than the state at large); <em>Fond du Lac, </em>273 Wis. at 338-39 (explaining that \"where a matter affects the interests of local residents as well as the interests of the people in other areas of the state, the test to be applied in resolving the matter is that of paramount interest.. . .\").</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">\u00b6 118. Under this approach, while we recognize that the impact of Act 10 on both the Milwaukee ERS and the City of Milwaukee is significant and unquestionably touches on a matter of local affairs, we conclude the Act primarily implicates a matter of statewide concern. The State has a substantial interest in maintaining uniform regulations on public pension plans in order to reduce the fiscal strain caused by state and local expenditures for public employee compensation. Further, the State is obligated to maintain a functioning civil service system. Public employees work in areas of fundamental importance, ranging from education and public health, to housing and sanitation. Without question, the State has an interest in seeking to safeguard the vitality of these essential services in times of economic uncertainty and duress.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b189-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>\u00b6 119. We do not suggest that the City of Milwaukee mismanaged its retirement system or that Governor Walker and state legislature enacted a law that has been or will be effective in fulfilling its purported objectives. Such political inquiries are beyond the purview of this court. The legislature has broad latitude to experiment with economic problems and we do not presume to second-guess its wisdom. <em>See Ferguson v. Skrupa, </em>372 U.S. 726 (1963). Instead, our review is limited to determining whether the policy matter at issue between the conflicting state and local regulation is best described as involving a local affair or a statewide concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">\u00b6 120. Here, the state legislation at issue, Act 10, was enacted by the legislature during a period of intense fiscal uncertainty.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> The National Association of State Budget Officers noted that 2010 \"presented the most difficult challenge for states' financial management since the Great Depression. ...\" Nat'l Governors Ass'n &amp; Nat'l Ass'n of State Budget Officers, <em>The Fiscal Survey of States </em>vii (June 2010). At the time Act 10 was enacted, the Department of Administration was pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>dieting Wisconsin was facing a $3.6 billion dollar budget deficit.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark> Nationwide, analysts projected that states would face close to $300 billion in budget shortfalls between fiscal years 2009 and 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-3\">\u00b6 121. Enacted during an emergency legislative session, and referred to broadly as the Budget Repair Bill, the scope of Act 10 is extraordinary. It addresses a broad range of subjects, including health insurance premiums, collective bargaining of state employees, retirement contributions for public employees statewide, and modifications to the earned income tax credit.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">\u00b6 122. It is significant that Act 10 impacts the entire state. Act 10 is not narrow and particularized in its application; rather, it is a broad and comprehensive law that applies, not just to City of Milwaukee employees, but to every general employee in the State of Wisconsin. Governor Walker and the legislature determined that, considering the challenges presented by the grim economic climate, it was imperative to make drastic public policy changes, in several areas of the law, spanning the entire state.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">\u00b6 123. We find that, given the facts presented in this case, the conflicting state and local regulations are of more paramount concern within the state as a whole than in the City of Milwaukee. Accordingly, we conclude that Wis. Stat. \u00a7 62.623 and related statutes are primarily a matter of statewide concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">\u00b6 124. We note the plaintiffs insist this conclusion cannot be reached without ignoring the deference owed to a statement of intent included in a 1947 legislative <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>amendment pertaining to the Milwaukee ERS.<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> We find this argument unpersuasive. The statement of intent referenced by the plaintiffs provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-4\">For the purpose of giving to cities of the first class the largest measure of self-government with respect to pension annuity and retirement systems compatible with the constitution and general law, it is hereby declared to be the legislative policy that all future amendments and alterations to this act are matters of local affair and government and shall not be construed as an enactment of state-wide concern.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-5\">\u00a7 31(1), ch. 441, Laws of 1947. The plaintiffs argue that this statement of intent preserved the City of Milwaukee's autonomy in managing the Milwaukee ERS and precluded future state legislative enactments that infringe on that autonomy.</p>\n<p id=\"b191-6\">\u00b6 125. The plaintiffs overstate their case. To be sure, this court has held that legislative determinations regarding whether a policy matter constitutes a \"statewide concern\" or a matter of \"local affairs,\" is entitled great weight when categorizing legislative acts. <em>See, e.g., Van </em>Gilder, 222 Wis. at 73-74 (noting that \"[e]ven though the determination made by [the legislature] should be held not to be absolutely controlling, nevertheless it is entitled to great weight because matters of public policy are primarily for the legislature\").</p>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">\u00b6 126. However, we reject the plaintiffs' contention that the legislature's declaration in 1947 that the Milwaukee ERS is a matter of local concern is an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>immutable determination. While the legislature in 1947 may have intended to block future legislatures from regulating public sector pension funds in <em>the </em>City of Milwaukee, it unquestionably lacked that power through direct legislative action, let alone through a general statement of legislative intent. Wisconsin case law has long held that \"[o]ne legislature may not bind a future legislature's flexibility to address changing needs. Thus, one legislature may not enact a statute which has implications of control over the final deliberations or actions of future legislatures.\" <em>Flynn v. Dep't of Admin., </em>216 Wis. 2d 521, 543, 576 N.W.2d 245 (1998) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-4\">\u00b6 127. Further, the nature of public policy matters is not static,<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> and as a result, the character of governmental functions can change over time. Plainly, the legislature's determination in 1947 that pension and retirement plans are a local concern does not mean it is an accurate portrayal of how pension and retirement plans impact the fiscal realities of Wisconsin in 2014. <em>See, e.g., </em>1 Chester James Antieau, <em>Municipal Corporation Law </em>\u00a7 3.40, at 3-108 (1995) (\"The danger[] to be avoided [is] ... a temptation to consider something 'state' or 'local' because it was so denominated fifty years ago\") <footnotemark>43</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b193-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"83\">*83</page-number>\u00b6 128. The ultimate determination whether a legislative enactment is primarily a matter of local or statewide concern rests with this court and not the legislature. <em>Van Gilder, </em>222 Wis. 58. Thus, while we give deference to the legislature's 1947 proclamation, it is not conclusive in our home rule analysis of Wis. Stat. \u00a7 62.623.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">\u00b6 129. Therefore, for the reasons explained above, we hold that Wis. Stat. \u00a7 62.623 concerns a matter of primarily statewide concern. Accordingly, we need not go any further to conclude that Wis. Stat. \u00a7 62.623 survives the plaintiffs' home rule challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">E. Wisconsin Stat. \u00a7 62.623 and the Contract Clause</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">\u00b6 130. Having determined that Wis. Stat. \u00a7 62.623 does not violate the home rule amendment, we turn to whether the statute violates the constitutionally protected right of parties to contract with each other.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-8\">\u00b6 131. As we explained <em>supra </em>\u00b6 87, the Milwaukee ERS<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> requires that plan members contribute, or have contributed on their behalf, 5.5% of their earnable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>compensation. Prior to the enactment of Act 10, the City of Milwaukee funded the member contributions of each municipal employee hired prior to January 1, 2010. Wisconsin Stat. \u00a7 62.623, created by Act 10, prohibits the City of Milwaukee from making these contributions to the Milwaukee ERS on the plan member's behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-3\">\u00b6 132. Chapter 36 of the Milwaukee Charter Ordinance (\"Chapter 36\") establishes the framework of the Milwaukee ERS. The plaintiffs argue these provisions contractually guarantee that the City of Milwaukee will fund the member contributions to the Milwaukee ERS on behalf of each participating employee hired prior to January 1, 2010, and that, consequently, Wis. Stat. \u00a7 62.623 constitutes an unconstitutional impairment of contractual obligations. The defendants counter that Wis. Stat. \u00a7 62.623 impairs no contractual rights between the City of Milwaukee and its employees. In the alternative, the State argues that even if an impairment of contractual rights exists, a significant and legitimate public purpose justifies the impairment and the legislation is narrowly tailored to serve that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-4\">i. General Contract Clause Principles</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">\u00b6 133. The Wisconsin Constitution prohibits the State from impairing its contractual obligations. <em>Dairyland Greyhound Park, Inc. v. Doyle, </em>2006 WI 107, \u00b6 51, 295 Wis. 2d 1, 719 N.W.2d 408. The Contract Clause of the Wisconsin Constitution provides: \"[n]o bill of attain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>der, ex post facto law, nor any law impairing the obligation of contracts, shall ever be passed....\" Wis. Const, art. I, \u00a7 12.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">\u00b6 134. In evaluating a claim brought under the Contract Clause, we first consider whether the contested state legislation has \"operated as a substantial impairment of a contractual relationship.\" <em>Allied Structural Steel Co. v. Spannaus, </em>438 U.S. 234, 244 (1978). This inquiry has three components: (1) whether there is a contractual relationship, (2) whether a change in law impairs that contractual relationship, and (3) whether the impairment is substantial. <em>Dairyland, </em>295 Wis. 2d 1, \u00b6 261 (Prosser, J., concurring in part/dissenting in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b195-6\">\u00b6 135. The inquiry does not end when the reviewing court finds a contractual relationship exists and that the change in law constitutes a substantial impairment of that contractual relationship. If the legislative act constitutes a substantial impairment to a contractual relationship, it will still be upheld if a significant and legitimate public purpose for the legislation exists. <em>Id., </em>\u00b6 56. \"Although the public purpose need no longer address an emergency or temporary situation, it should be directed towards remedying a broad and general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>social or economic problem\" as opposed to benefiting a narrow special interest. <em>Chappy v. LIRC, </em>136 Wis. 2d 172, 188, 401 N.W.2d 568 (1987); <em>see also Energy Reserves Grp., Inc. v. Kansas Power &amp; Light Co., </em>459 U.S. 400, 412 (1983).</p>\n<p id=\"b196-4\">\u00b6 136. Finally, if a significant and legitimate purpose exists for the challenged legislation, \"the question becomes whether the legislature's impairment of the contract is reasonable and necessary to serve an important public purpose.\" <em>Wis. Prof'l Police Ass'n v. Lightbourn, </em>2001 WI 59, \u00b6 149, 243 Wis. 2d 512, 627 N.W.2d 807.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">\u00b6 137. As the court of appeals explained in its certification, under the established framework for Contract Clause analysis, the plaintiffs' challenge presents two issues: (1) whether Chapter 36 of the Milwaukee Charter Ordinance contains a contractual guarantee that the City of Milwaukee will fund the member contributions on behalf of each participating employee hired prior to January 1, 2010, and (2) if a contractual right exists, whether there has been an impermissible impairment of the contract.<footnotemark>46</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b197-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>ii. Contractual Rights Under Milwaukee ERS</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">\u00b6 138. A legislative enactment is presumed not to create \"contractual or vested rights but merely declares a policy to be pursued until the legislature shall ordain otherwise.\" <em>Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp. v. Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Ry. Co., </em>470 U.S. 451, 466 (1985) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also U.S. Trust Co. v. New Jersey, </em>431 U.S. 1, 17 n.14 (1977) (a statute is \"treated as a contract when the language and circumstances evince a legislative intent to create private rights of a contractual nature enforceable against the State\"). Thus, courts employ a \"very strong\" presumption that \"legislative enactments do not create contractual rights.\" <em>Dunn v. Milwaukee Cnty., </em>2005 WI App 27, \u00b6 8, 279 Wis. 2d 370, 693 N.W.2d 82.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">\u00b6 139. The threshold requirement to recognize public contracts has been referred to as the \"unmistakability doctrine.\" <em>Parker v. Wakelin, </em>123 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1997). The unmistakability doctrine is a canon of construction rooted in the belief that \"legislatures should not bind future legislatures from employing their sovereign powers in the absence of the clearest of intent to create vested rights protected under the Contract Clause . ...\" <em>Id. </em>(\" '[N] either the right of taxation, nor any other power of sovereignty, will be held .. . to have been surrendered, unless such surrender has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>been expressed in terms too plain to be mistaken.'\" <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Winstar Corp., </em>518 U.S. 839, 874-75 (1996)). \"The requirement that 'the government's obligation unmistakably appear thus served the dual purposes of limiting contractual incursions on a State's sovereign powers and of avoiding difficult constitutional questions about the extent of State authority to limit the subsequent exercise of legislative power.'\" <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Winstar, </em>518 U.S. at 875).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">\u00b6 140. Hence, in this case, we must consider whether Chapter 36 of the Milwaukee Charter Ordinance evinces a clear intent by the City of Milwaukee Common Council (\"Common Council\")<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> to create contractual rights against the modification of contribution payments to the Milwaukee ERS.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">\u00b6 141. Wisconsin precedent has held that public pension plans may create constitutionally protected contractual rights between the State and public employees that are protected by the Wisconsin Constitution. <em>See State ex rel. Cannon v. Moran, </em>111 Wis. 2d 544, 554, 331 N.W.2d 369 (1983) (holding that the plaintiffs, as plan members of the Milwaukee County Employees' Retirement System, had a constitutionally protected contract).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">\u00b6 142. As this court has noted, however, when examining whether a legislative enactment creates a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>contractual relationship, it is imperative to determine whether the legislature intended to \"create private contractual or vested rights\" or \"merely to declared a policy to be pursued . . . <em>Morrison v. Bd. of Educ. of City of West Allis, </em>237 Wis. 483, 487, 297 N.W 383 (1941). For a legislative enactment to be considered a contract, \"the language and circumstances [must] evince a legislative intent to create private rights of a contractual nature enforceable against the State.\" <em>Lightbourn, </em>243 Wis. 2d 512, \u00b6 145 n.188 (quoting <em>U.S. Trust, </em>431 U.S. at 17 n.14). This requires us, when reviewing a particular legislative enactment, to suspend judgment and\" 'proceed cautiously both in identifying a contract within the language of a regulatory statute and in defining the contours of any contractual obligation.' \" <em>Parker, </em>123 F.3d at 7-8 (quoting <em>Atchison, </em>470 U.S. at 466).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">\u00b6 143. We begin with the language of Chapter 36 of the Milwaukee Charter Ordinance.<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> The parties' arguments rely on the following ordinance subsections from Chapter 36:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-5\">\u00a7 36-08-7-a-l: [T]he city shall contribute on behalf of general city employes 5.5% of such member's earnable compensation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-6\">\u00a7 36-13-2-a: Every such member... shall thereby have a benefit contract in .... all... benefits in the amounts and upon the terms and conditions and in all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>other respects as provided under this [ordinance] ... and each member and beneficiary having such a benefit contract shall have a vested right to such .. . benefits and they shall not be diminished or impaired by subsequent legislation or by any other means without his consent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-4\">\u00a7 36-13-2-c: Every person who shall become a member of this retirement system . .. shall have a similar benefit contract and vested right in ... all... benefits in the amounts and on the terms and conditions and in all other respects as ... in effect at the date of the commencement of his membership.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-5\">\u00a7 36-13-2-d: Contributions which are made to this fund ... by the city ... as contributions for members of this system shall not in any manner whatsoever affect, alter or impair any member's rights, benefits, or allowances, to which such member under this [ordinance] is or may be entitled....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-6\">\u00a7 36-13-2-g: Every member, retired member, survivor and beneficiary who participates in the combined fund shall have a vested and contractual right to the benefits in the amount and on the terms and conditions as provided in the law on the date the combined fund is created.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">\u00b6 144. Turning to the language of Chapter 36, we find it unquestionably creates contractual rights in the pension benefits of Milwaukee ERS plan members.<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> Two subsections of Chapter 36 are particularly germane in reaching this conclusion. First, \u00a7 36-13-2-g provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b200-8\">Every member, retired member, survivor and beneficiary who participates in the combined fund <em>shall have </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number><em>a vested and contractual right to the benefits </em>in the amount and on the terms and conditions as provided in the law on the date the combined fund is created.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-4\">(Emphasis added.) Further, \u00a7 36-13-2-a provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b201-5\"><em>Every such </em>member... <em>shall thereby have a benefit contract </em>in ... all... benefits in the amounts and upon the terms and conditions and in all other respects as provided under this [ordinance] ... and each member and beneficiary having such a benefit contract shall have a vested right to such . . . benefits and they shall not be diminished or impaired by subsequent legislation or by any other means without his consent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">\u00b6 145. Sections 36-13-2-g and 36-13-2-a unmistakably evince the clear intention of the Common Council to create a \"vested and contractual right to the [pension] benefits in the amount and on the terms and conditions\" as provided in Chapter 36. \u00a7 36-13-2-g.</p>\n<p id=\"AQJ\">\u00b6 146. However, this still leaves unresolved the central issue before us: whether \"contributions\" to the Milwaukee ERS fit within the \"benefits\" for which plan members have a \"vested and contractual right.\" \u00a7 36-13-2-g.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-9\">\u00b6 147. The defendants contend that \u00a7 36-13-2-g, which the plaintiffs cite as creating a \"contractual right\" to the contributions paid by the City of Milwaukee, can create no such contractual obligation because the subsection does not refer explicitly to \"contributions.\"<footnotemark>50</footnotemark> Further, the defendants argue \u00a7 36-13-2-d demon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>strates that, as the terms are used in Chapter 36, contributions to the Milwaukee ERS are not \"benefits\" or \"terms and conditions.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b202-3\">\u00b6 148. The plaintiffs disagree with the defendants' reading of Chapter 36 and note that the title of \u00a7 36-13-2 is \"Contracts to Assure Benefits,\" and that the subsection guarantees that every member shall have a benefit contract and vested right concerning \"[t]he annuities and all other benefits in the amounts and upon the terms and conditions and in all other respects as provided under this act [which] shall not be diminished or impaired by any subsequent legislation or by any other means.\" \u00a7 36-13-2-a. The plaintiffs contend that the words \"upon the terms and conditions and in all other respects as provided under this act,\" incorporate \u00a7 36-08-7a-l, which provides that the City of Milwaukee will contribute <em>5.5% </em>of its employees' earnable compensation to the Milwaukee ERS.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">\u00b6 149. The parties agree that Chapter 36 unambiguously requires plan members of the Milwaukee ERS to \"contribute or have contributed on their behalf, <em>5.5% </em>of the member's earnable compensation.\" \u00a7 36-08-7a-l. Since 1970, and until the enactment of Act 10, the City of Milwaukee, pursuant to \u00a7 36-08-7-a-1, has paid the employees' contribution share:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b202-5\">Members who are not firemen, policemen or elected officials shall contribute or have contributed on their behalf, 5.5% of the member's earnable compensation. Except as provided in subds. 2 and 3, subsequent to and commencing with the first pay period of 1970, the city shall contribute on behalf of general city employes 5.5% of such member's earnable compensation. Members <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>employed by city agencies participating in the system shall contribute 5.5% of their earnable compensation less any contribution made on their behalf as determined by the governing bodies of such agencies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-4\">The plaintiffs argue that the contributions referred to in this subsection are a \"benefit,\" and accordingly, pursuant to \u00a7 36-13-2-g and \u00a7 36-13-2-a, plan members have a contractually vested right in the contributions paid by the City of Milwaukee on behalf of all participating plan members.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-5\">\u00b6 150. Upon a close reading of the language of Chapter 36, however, we find nothing to suggest that the City of Milwaukee intended to classify contribution rates as a contractually protected \"benefit.\" Consequently, there is no indication the Common Council, and by extension the State, bound itself to never modifying the contribution rates that fund the Milwaukee ERS.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-6\">\u00b6 151. Two sources in particular inform our analysis. In \u00a7 36-13-2-d, an evident distinction is drawn between \"contributions\" used to fund the Milwaukee ERS and the \"benefits\" conferred to plan members. Section 36-13-2-d provides, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b203-7\">Contributions which are made to [the Milwaukee ERS] ... by the city ... as contributions for members of this system shall not in any manner whatsoever affect, alter or impair any member's <em>rights, benefits, </em>or <em>allowances, </em>to which such member under this [ordinance] is or may be entitled ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b203-8\">(Emphasis added). This subsection unquestionably distinguishes between the \"contributions\" paid by the City of Milwaukee and the contractually protected \"benefits\" of the plan members. Our rules of interpretation dictate that Chapter 36 must \"be construed in a manner that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>no word is rendered surplusage and every word is given effect.\" <em>Cnty. of Adams v. Romeo, </em>191 Wis. 2d 379, 387, 528 N.W.2d 418 (1995). Under \u00a7 36-13-2-d, it is impossible for contributions to be construed as a benefit. The plaintiffs' argument is premised on the notion that the contributions paid by the City of Milwaukee impact the benefits of plan members. Section 36-13-2-d unequivocally refutes that contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">\u00b6 152. Section 36-05 further belies the plaintiffs' argument that \"contributions\" are a \"benefit\" under Chapter 36. Section 36-05, titled \"Benefits,\" defines the pension, disability, and death benefits offered under the Milwaukee ERS.<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> This section outlines in detail the scope of the word \"benefits\" as it is used in the Charter, listing every benefit of the plan and the terms and conditions related to those benefits. The City of Milwaukee's self-imposed obligation to pay the employee share of contributions is conspicuously absent from this section.<footnotemark>52</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b205-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>\u00b6 153. In sum, no unmistakable indicia exists in Chapter 36 that contributions paid by the city are a defined \"benefit\" that is forever impervious to alteration.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-4\">\u00b6 154. As a defined benefit plan, the Milwaukee ERS calculates benefits based on years of service multiplied by a fixed percentage of base salary. <em>See </em>Milwaukee, Wis. Charter Ordinance ch. 36. The plaintiffs argue that Wis. Stat. \u00a7 62.623, by requiring plan members to contribute 5.5% of their earnable compensation, diminishes the value of the benefit without providing a commensurate gain. So, the plaintiffs contend, the defendants' position that contributions are not a \"term and condition\" effectively excludes the cost of the plan to the employee as a \"term and condition\" under Chapter 36, which is an absurd result.</p>\n<p id=\"b205-5\">\u00b6 155. The plaintiffs' argument conflates the accrued benefits of plan members, which Wis. Stat. \u00a7 62.623 does not affect, and the funding provisions of Chapter 36, which are not considered a \"benefit\" under the Charter. Nothing in Act 10 purports to reduce, impair, or affect in any way benefits that have already accrued to plan members. Wisconsin Stat. \u00a7 62.623 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>modifies only the method by which the Milwaukee ERS is funded; the pension, disability, and death benefits that accrue to plan members, pursuant to the terms and conditions in \u00a7 36-05, remain unaffected.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-4\">\u00b6 156. The plaintiffs' contention that Wis. Stat. \u00a7 62.623 diminishes accrued \"benefits\" because it is more costly for plan members misses the point. It is certainly true that the Milwaukee ERS calculates the benefits for a plan member based on years of service multiplied by a fixed percentage of their base salary. To be clear, however, Wis. Stat. \u00a7 62.623 does not modify this benefit. It does not modify the base salary of the plan member, the amount of benefits received under the plan, or the plan's overall cost. Rather, Wis. Stat. \u00a7 62.623 changes only the allocation of those costs\u2014 that is, the contribution requirements shared by the City of Milwaukee and the plan member. We are not overlooking \u2014 nor are we unsympathetic to \u2014 the fact that Wis. Stat. \u00a7 62.623 increases the cost of participating in the Milwaukee ERS for general employees. This increased cost, however, does not constitute a Contract Clause violation. The plaintiffs may have to contribute more to receive the same benefit, but \"the fact that a state makes a contract more costly to one of the parties does not establish a [Contract Clause] violation.\" <em>Chrysler Corp. v. Kolosso Auto Sales, Inc., </em>148 F.3d 892, 894 (7th Cir. 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b206-6\">\u00b6 157. Our decision is dictated by the plain language in the Milwaukee Charter Ordinance. Nothing in the Charter evidences that the legislature unmistakably intended to create binding contract rights in the contribution rates established in \u00a7 36-08-7-a-l. Further, even if it were unclear whether the legislature intended \"contributions\" to be a contractually vested <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>\"benefit,\" the very strong presumption employed against state laws creating contractual rights would still defeat the plaintiffs' claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-4\">\u00b6 158. We need not reach the question of impairment or substantiality because the plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that the allocation of contribution rates in the Milwaukee ERS is a contractual \"benefit\" protected by the Contract Clause. We conclude that the City of Milwaukee was not contractually obligated to pay the employee share of contributions into the Milwaukee ERS. Therefore, we hold that the plaintiffs failed to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that Wis. Stat. \u00a7 62.623 violates the Contract Clause of the Wisconsin Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-5\">IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b207-6\">\u00b6 159. We hold the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b207-7\">\u00b6 160. First, we hold that the plaintiffs' associational rights argument is without merit. We reject the plaintiffs' argument that several provisions of Act 10, which delineate the rights, obligations, and procedures of collective bargaining, somehow infringe upon general employees' constitutional right to freedom of association. No matter the limitations or \"burdens\" a legislative enactment places on the collective bargaining process, collective bargaining remains a creation of legislative grace and not constitutional obligation. The First Amendment cannot be used as a vehicle to expand the parameters of a benefit that it does not itself protect. Accordingly, we conclude that Wis. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 111.70(4)(mb), 66.0506, 118.245, 111.70(l)(f), 111.70(3g), 111.70(4)(d)3 and the third sentence of \u00a7111.70(2) do not violate the plaintiffs' associational rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>\u00b6 161. Second, we reject the plaintiffs' equal protection claim under a rational basis standard of review. We apply rational basis review to the plaintiffs' argument that the collective bargaining framework established by Act 10 violates the constitutional rights of general employees through disparate treatment of those who choose to collectively bargain and those who do not. Finding the plaintiffs' argument to be unconvincing, we hold Act 10 survives the plaintiffs' equal protection challenge under rational basis review.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-4\">\u00b6 162. Third, we hold the plaintiffs' home rule amendment argument fails because Wis. Stat. \u00a7 62.623 primarily concerns a matter of statewide concern. Accordingly, we hold that Wis. Stat. \u00a7 62.623 does not violate the home rule amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-5\">\u00b6 163. Finally, we hold that the plaintiffs' Contract Clause claim fails. The City of Milwaukee was not contractually obligated to pay the employee share of contributions to the Milwaukee ERS. Further, even if the contributions paid by the City were a contractual right, we hold the contract was not substantially impaired by Wis. Stat. \u00a7 62.623. Therefore, we hold that the plaintiffs failed to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that Wis. Stat. \u00a7 62.623 violates the Contract Clause of the Wisconsin Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-6\">\u00b6 164. Therefore, we uphold Act 10 in its entirety.</p>\n<p id=\"A61\"><em>By the Court. </em>\u2014 The decision and order of the circuit court is reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b129-5\"> Provisions of Act 10 were reenacted without amendment in 2011 Wisconsin Act 32 (\"Act 32\"), the 2011-13 state budget, which reestablished collective bargaining rights for some municipal transit employees.

In fact, H.W. Fowler, an ardent advocate of the \"-ee\" suffix, notes in the first edition of A <em>Dictionary of Modem English Language </em>(1926) that in the late 19th century the Oxford English Dictionary \"labelled employee 'rare exc.

Under Act 10, \"general employees\" is a catch-all term for public employees who are not \"public safety employees.\" <em>See, e.g., </em>Wis. Stat. \u00a7 111.70(fm). Employees classified as \"public safety employees\" are not affected by Act 10's modifications to the Municipal Employment Relations Act and the State Employee Labor Relations Act. The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit recently held, under a rational basis standard of review, that the public employee classifications created by Act 10 did not violate equal protection. <em>See </em>Wis. <em>Educ. Ass'n Council v. Walker, </em>705 F.3d 640, 656 (7th Cir. 2013). The public employee classifications are not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b132-5\"> The plaintiffs argue that specific provisions of MERA, as amended by Act 10, are unconstitutional.

We agree with the court of appeals, however, that the plaintiffs fail to present a developed argument to support their suggestion that Article I, Sections 3 and 4 of the Wisconsin Constitution should confer more expansive protection than its federal counterpart under the particular facts in this case. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>Accordingly, in our analysis of the plaintiffs' associational rights claims, we treat the rights protected under the Wisconsin and United States Constitutions to be coextensive. <em>See Lawson v. Hous. Auth. of Milwaukee, </em>270 Wis. 269, 274, 70 N.W.2d 605, 608 (1955). (holding that Article I, Sections 3 and 4 of the Wisconsin Constitution \"guarantee the same freedom of speech and right of assembly and petition as do the First and Fourteenth [A]mendments of the United States [C]onstitution.\"); <em>see also Cnty. of Kenosha v.C &amp; S Mgmt., Inc., </em>223 Wis. 2d 373, 388, 588 N.W.2d 236 (1999) (\"Wisconsin courts consistently have held that Article I, \u00a7 3 of the Wisconsin Constitution guarantees the same freedom of speech rights as the First Amendment of the United States Constitution\").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b140-10\"> Act 10 defines \"consumer price index change\" as \"the average annual percentage change in the consumer price index for all urban consumers, U.S. city average, as determined by the federal department of labor, for the 12 months immediately preceding the current date.\" Wis. Stat. \u00a7 111.70(l)(cm).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b142-7\"> The plaintiffs' emphasis on this point is prudent. It is well-established law that no constitutional right to collective bargaining exists. <em>See, e.g., Smith v. Ark. State Highway Emp., Local 1315, </em>441 U.S. 463, 465 (1979) (holding \"the First Amendment does not impose any affirmative obligation on the government to listen, to respond or, in this context, to recognize the association and bargain with it\"). It is undisputed the State could eliminate collective bargaining entirely without violating the constitutional rights of the plaintiffs.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b150-7\"> It is unclear whether the dissent uses the term \"collective bargaining unit\" as it is defined under Act 10, or if the term is meant to encompass a broader meaning. We assume the dissent does not contend that there is always a constitutional right to organize as a \"collective bargaining unit\" in a statutory framework created by the state. This would mean the state is constitutionally obligated to create such a framework, which is clearly not true. <em>See Smith, </em>441 U.S. at 464-65. It is more likely the dissent means that, if a statutory framework has been created by the state for collective bargaining purposes, state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>employees have a constitutional right to organize within that framework as a \"collective bargaining unit.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">Even adopting this understanding, however, it is unclear how its reliance on <em>NLRB v. Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp., </em>301 U.S. 1 (1937) is appropriate. In support of its proposition that \"it has long been established there is a constitutional right to organize as a collective bargaining unit,\" <em>id., </em>the dissent quotes, with emphasis added, language from <em>Jones &amp; Laughlin: </em>\"the right of employees to self-organization and to select representatives of their own choosing for collective bargaining or other mutual protection without restraint or coercion by their employer ... is a fundamental right.\" 301 U.S. at 33. <em>Jones &amp; Laughlin </em>does not support the dissent's argument, however, because the case concerned private, as opposed to public, employers. Thus the \"right\" referred to by the Supreme Court could not have been constitutional. <em>See Laborers Local 236 v. Walker, </em>2014 WL 1502249, at *8 (citing The Civil Rights Cases, 109 U.S. 3, 17-18 (1883)).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b153-5\"> <em>See </em>Wis. Stat. \u00a7 111.70(2) (\"Municipal employees have the right of self-organization, and the right to form, join, or assist labor organizations, to bargain collectively through representatives of their own choosing, and to engage in lawful, concerted activities for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection\").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b153-6\"> Implicit in the dissent's accusation is the belief that statutory frameworks that are based on a model of exclusive representation are unconstitutional if any limits are placed on the subjects upon which employees may collectively bargain. At present, forty-one states have adopted the federal model of exclusive representation. <em>See, e.g., </em>Brief for the States of New York, Arkansas, et. al. as Amici Curiae in Support of Respondents, <em>Harris v. Quinn, </em>(2013) (No. 11-681) 2013 WL 6907713, at *8. Of these, a significant number have imposed limitations on the subjects of collective bargaining. <em>See, e.g., </em>Ind. Code 20-29-6-4.5; Mich. Comp. Laws \u00a7 380.1248; 115 Ill. Comp. Stat. 5/4.5; 2011 N.J. Laws ch. 78; <em>see also </em>Martin H. Malin, <em>Does Public Employee Collective Bargaining Distort Democracy? A Perspective from the United States, </em>34 Comp. Lab. L. &amp; Pol'y J. 277, 285-88 (2013). We note that adopting the dissent's consti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>tutional argument would effectively repeal a vast amount of legislation in states across the nation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b156-10\"> These observations are not unexpected, considering that the presence of a right to freedom of association \"plainly presupposes a freedom not to associate.\" <em>Roberts v.

To compel an individual to pay fees to support an organization that engages in political and economic activities, which the individual has no interest in supporting, raises self-apparent First Amendment concerns.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b157-4\"> The dissent notes that the United States Supreme Court affirmed in <em>Harris v. Quinn, </em>573 U.S. _, 134 S. Ct. 2618, 2638 (2014), that fair share agreements for \"full-fledged state employees\" are constitutionally permissible. Dissent, \u00b6 206 n.8. To say the least, the dissent puts a positive spin on <em>Harris's </em>impact on the constitutional legitimacy of fair share agreements. <em>Harris </em>concluded that the First Amendment prohibits the collection of fees from Illinois home-care personal assistants who do not want to join or support the labor organization representing them. It is true <em>Harris </em>is not directly applicable to this case because the employees at issue in <em>Harris, </em>while government-funded, were not \"full-fledged state employees.\" 134 S. Ct. at 2638. Nevertheless, <em>Harris </em>clearly signals that fair share agreements are constitutionally suspect beyond the context of quasi-State employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-7\">In <em>Harris, </em>the State of Illinois pointed to the Supreme Court's holding in <em>Abood v. Detroit Bd. of Educ., </em>431 U.S. 209 (1977), to argue the fair share agreement at issue was permissible. In <em>Abood, </em>the Supreme Court upheld a fair share agreement requiring public school teachers in Detroit to pay dues to the labor organization representing them, even though they opposed public sector collective bargaining. 431 U.S. at 211. <em>Harris </em>illustrates that time has not been kind to <em>Abood. </em>Since it was decided in 1977, the Supreme Court's criticism of <em>Abood's </em>holding and underlying rationale has become increasingly pointed. Two years ago, in <em>Knox v. Serv. Emps. Int'l Union, Local 1000, </em>the Supreme Court noted that <em>Abood </em>was \"something of an anomaly.\" <em>Knox, </em>132 S. Ct. 2277, 2290 (2012). <em>Harris </em>goes further in expressing disapproval of <em>Abood, </em>explaining at length why its analysis \"is questionable on several grounds.\" <em>Harris, </em>134 S. Ct. at 2621. The holding of <em>Abood </em>may be alive in our jurisprudence, but it is not well. As Justice Alito broadly stated in concluding the majority's analysis in <em>Harris, </em>\"if we accepted Illinois' argument, we would approve an unprecedented violation of the bedrock principle that, except perhaps in the rarest of circumstances, no person in this country may be compelled to subsidize speech by a third party that he or she does not wish to support.\" <em>Id. </em>at 2644.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b160-8\"> The Wisconsin State Employees Association was organized in 1932.

Wis. Stat. \u00a7 62.05(2). For example, Madison has a sufficient population to meet the first-class city population requirement, but for purposes of statutes related to cities, Madison remains a city of the second class.

It is uncontested in this case that the City of Milwaukee properly enacted a charter ordinance and, consequently, has properly exercised its home rule authority in governing, funding, and administrating the Milwaukee ERS.

The considerable significance this analytical approach ascribes to the box a policy matter is placed in exacerbates the risk of a cavalier, mechanistic jurisprudence. Accordingly, given that the policy matters of conflicting state and local regulations often diverge in scope and purpose, and their categorization is of substantial consequence, we conclude that our established approach of categorizing the policy matters of conflicting regulations by examining whether the concern arising from the conflict is greatest within the municipality or the state to be sensible.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"38\">\n<p id=\"b188-5\"> The dissent suggests that our conclusion rests primarily on the fiscal concerns underlying and leading up to the enactment of Act 10.

As we explained <em>supra </em>note 37, we conclude the more sensible approach is to balance the interests of both the state legislation and the charter ordinance at issue.

In answering the legal questions put to us as we must, we affirm a legislative act that appears to have gone further than needed. For many <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>public workers, Act 10 effectively ended meaningful union representation carried out through statutory collective bargaining. This type of statutory collective bargaining has long been part of Wisconsin's progressive heritage.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">\u00b6 166. It is my firm belief that individuals should have the right to organize and bargain collectively regarding their wages and the terms of their employment. As thoughtful people from across the political spectrum and around the world have long recognized, collective bargaining benefits workers, employers and society itself. Although Act 10 does not violate either the United States Constitution or the Wisconsin Constitution, it erodes longstanding benefits both to public workers and to public employers. I write separately to make clear what my vote in this case means and to emphasize the importance of policies that give rights to workers to organize and bargain collectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">I. THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">\u00b6 167. The legal questions in this case can be answered in no other way than the majority answers them. Because the affected workers retain \"a right to associate for the purpose of engaging in those activities protected by the First Amendment,\"<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Act 10 violates neither their constitutional right of association nor their right to equal protection.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The collective bargaining rights at issue here are statutory, not constitutional rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>\u00b6 168. As I stated in <em>League of Women Voters v. Walker, </em>another case in which plaintiffs made a purely facial challenge to the constitutionality of a statute, the limited question presented and the legal framework prescribed for answering it demand significant restraint on the part of this court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-4\">With this type of facial challenge, the odds are against the plaintiffs at every turn. A court is bound to recognize the presumption that the statute is constitutional. Here, the plaintiffs must prove otherwise beyond a reasonable doubt. In considering such a challenge, a court must resolve any doubt about the constitutionality of a statute in favor of upholding the statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-5\">In short, the question before us in this case is not whether the [challenged statute] is good policy, not whether it accomplishes what it sets out to do, and not whether it is unfair under some circumstances to some individuals. The question before us in this case is solely this: starting with a presumption of constitutionality in its favor, are we persuaded beyond a reasonable doubt that the statute violates the Wisconsin Constitution in every circumstance? ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b210-6\">The question here is not whether the [statute] is good policy, but whether the plaintiffs have proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the [statute] violates the Wisconsin Constitution on any of the grounds claimed by these plaintiffs. Given the framework within which the question must be answered, I agree with the holding of the majority that the plaintiffs have not shown beyond a reasonable doubt that the statute is unconstitutional, and I join that holding and the mandate. I can reach no other conclusion than to uphold [the statute] based on the purely facial challenge here. I therefore respectfully concur.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b211-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number><em>League of Women Voters v.

As was true in that case, the analysis required here is straightforward. Under the proper application of the correct legal standard and the relevant precedent, this is not a close call. Therefore the plaintiffs' challenge must fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-5\">II. HISTORICAL RECOGNITION OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AND ITS VALUE TO SOCIETY</p>\n<p id=\"b211-6\">\u00b6 170. The value and necessity of collective bargaining and the fair treatment of workers have been recognized by many thoughtful people. As we considered this case, I recalled the eloquence of Rerum Novarum, the 1891 encyclical of Pope Leo XIII that seriously discussed the questions of resolving conflicts between employers and employees fairly and justly. Though more than 120 years have passed since his writing, the encyclical retains a remarkable relevance with its thoughtful comments about workers, employers, unions and \"free agreements\" reached about wages, hours and conditions of employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b211-7\">\u00b6 171. This lengthy document acknowledges the delicate task it undertakes, takes care to avoid extremist language and specifically rejects socialism as a solution to legitimate concerns of unjust working conditions. Instead, it adopts a respectful tone, recognizing the necessity of free enterprise to society, the value of work and the contributions of workers to their societies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b211-8\">Now, for the provision of such commodities, the labor of the working class \u2014 the exercise of their skill, and the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>employment of their strength, in the cultivation of the land, and in the workshops of trade \u2014 is especially responsible and quite indispensable... . Justice, therefore, demands that the interests of the working classes should be carefully watched over by the administration, so that they who contribute so largely to the advantage of the community may themselves share in the benefits which they create .... It follows that whatever shall appear to prove conducive to the well-being of those who work should obtain favorable consideration.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b212-4\">\u00b6 172. From such philosophical foundations, the writing turns to practical considerations:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-5\">Let the working man and the employer make free agreements, and in particular let them agree freely as to the wages.... In these and similar questions however- \u2014 -such as, for example, the hours of labor in different trades, the sanitary precautions to be observed in factories and workshops, etc. \u2014 in order to supersede undue interference on the part of the State, especially as circumstances, times, and localities differ so widely, it is advisable that recourse be had to societies or boards such as We shall mention presently, or to some other mode of safeguarding the interests of the wage-earners; the State being appealed to, should circumstances require, for its sanction and protection.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b212-6\">The most important of all [such associations designed to aid workers] are workingmen's unions, for these virtually include all the rest. History attests what excellent results were brought about by the artificers' guilds of olden times... . Such unions should be suited to the requirements of this our age \u2014 an age of wider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>education, of different habits, and of far more numerous requirements in daily life....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-3\">[T]o enter into a \"society\" of this kind is the natural right of man; and the State has for its office to protect natural rights, not to destroy them; and, if it forbids its citizens to form associations, it contradicts the very principle of its own existence, for both they and it exist in virtue of the like principle, namely, the natural tendency of man to dwell in society.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-4\">\u00b6 173. After setting out this template for mutually respectful relationships between employer and worker, and explicitly endorsing the value of protective organizations such as \"workingmen's unions,\" Pope Leo XIII goes on to state, \"[EJvery precaution should be taken not to violate the rights of individuals and not to impose unreasonable regulations under pretense of public benefit.\"<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b213-5\">\u00b6 174. The encyclical concludes,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b213-6\">We may lay it down as a general and lasting law that working men's associations should be so organized and governed as to furnish the best and most suitable means for attaining what is aimed at, that is to say, for helping each individual member to better his condition to the utmost in body, soul and property.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b213-7\">\u00b6 175. This recognition of the critical importance of a worker's right to collective bargaining was also central to the political philosophy of one of the most influential public figures in Wisconsin history, United States Senator Robert M. La Follette. Identifying the forces arrayed against the working person in the early twentieth century, La Follette stated at the outset of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>1912 presidential primaries, in which he was a candidate, \"I demand protection of wage-earners and farmers in their right to organize and to defend themselves by means of unions. All other issues are subordinate to this great issue.\"<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-4\">\u00b6 176. Interestingly, Ronald Reagan, a United States President some would consider to be from the other end of the political spectrum, expressed similar convictions. In 1980, the year he was elected, Reagan gave an impassioned Labor Day speech in which he pledged that \"American workers will once again be heeded\" and promised to \"consult with representatives of organized labor on those matters concerning the welfare of the working people of this nation.\"<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b214-5\">\u00b6 177. He noted his own union affiliation and experiences:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-6\">I happen to be the only president of a union ever to be a candidate for President of the United States. As president of my union \u2014 the Screen Actors Guild \u2014 I spent many hours with the late George Meany,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> whose love of country and whose belief in a strong defense against all totalitarians is one of labor's greatest legacies. One year ago today on Labor Day George Meany told the American people:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b214-7\">As American workers and their families return from their summer vacations they face growing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>unemployment and inflation, a climate of economic anxiety and uncertainty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-4\">Well I pledge to you in his memory that the voice of the American worker will once again be heeded in Washington and that the climate of fear that he spoke of will no longer threaten workers and their families.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-5\">\u00b6 178. Reagan went on to focus on the role of unions in bringing about a dramatic transformation of communist Poland:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b215-6\">These are the values inspiring those brave workers in Poland. The values that have inspired other dissidents under Communist domination. They remind us that where free unions and collective bargaining are forbidden, freedom is lost.... Today the workers in Poland are showing a new generation not how high is the price of freedom but how much it is worth that price.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b215-7\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b215-8\">\u00b6 179. It is my view that the Wisconsin Legislature and Governor could have chosen a different way to accomplish a goal of cost savings that would have left intact meaningful union representation carried out through statutory collective bargaining for public employees. It is also my view that the damage to public employee unions due to Act 10 was unnecessary. It is a departure from Wisconsin's strong tradition.</p>\n<p id=\"b215-9\">\u00b6 180. Act 10 embodies policy determinations, and such questions are not properly addressed to the members of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin. Such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>policy questions are for the Wisconsin Legislature and Governor, and their judgment on such policy matters is for the people of Wisconsin to evaluate. I respect the boundaries the judicial branch must observe and recognize that we cannot substitute our judgment on questions of policy for that of the Wisconsin Legislature and Governor.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Accordingly, I respectfully concur.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b209-8\"> Majority op., \u00b6 75 (recognizing that the equal protection argument hinges on the merit of the associational rights claim); <em>see also </em>majority op., \u00b6 24 (\"Whether the plaintiffs' First Amendment challenge to these provisions has any merit is the lynchpin of this appeal.\").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b212-7\"> Leo XIII, <em>Rerum Novarum: Encyclical of Pope Leo XIII on Capital and Labor </em>(1891), in Leo XIII, Rerum Novarum, at \u00b6 34 (Catholic Truth Soc'y 2002), <em>available at </em>http:// www.vatican.va/holy_father/leo_xiii/encyclicals/documents/ hf_l-xiii_enc_15051891_rerum-novarum_en.html.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b213-8\"> <em>Id. </em>at \u00b6\u00b6 45, 49 and 51.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b213-9\"><em> Id. </em>at \u00b6 52.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b213-10\"><em> Id. </em>at \u00b6 57.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b214-8\"> Robert M.

He emphasized the important role that courts serve in protecting the rights guaranteed under the Constitution. Courts serve as guardians of the constitutional rights of all people. Our challenge as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>court is to duly respect the prerogatives of the legislature as reflected in its legislative acts, while at the same time honoring our significant role. We must constantly guard against proper judicial restraint being transformed into improper judicial acquiescence.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-4\">\u00b6 183. In this case we are presented with constitutional challenges to Act 10. The majority aptly sets forth its results. However, it is difficult to find in the majority's lengthy opinion a discussion of the actual arguments and issues presented by the parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-5\">\u00b6 184. An actual issue presented by Madison Teachers is: Does Act 10 infringe on the associational rights of public employees to organize?<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b217-6\">\u00b6 185. Yet the majority reframes the issue to determine whether there is a constitutional right to collective bargaining and whether the State has an obligation to promote First Amendment rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-7\">\u00b6 186. An actual issue presented by the parties is: Does the provision in Act 10 prohibiting Milwaukee from making contributions to its employees' pension plans violate the Home Rule Amendment?</p>\n<p id=\"b217-8\">\u00b6 187. Rather than focusing on the provision at issue, the majority shifts the focus to the purpose behind Act 10 as a whole. It determines that because Act 10 deals generally with financial matters, the prohibition on Milwaukee's pension contributions is a matter of statewide concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-9\">\u00b6 188. An actual issue presented by the parties is: Does the prohibition on pension contributions violate the Contract Clause given that benefits are guaranteed by the Milwaukee Charter Ordinance?</p>\n<p id=\"b218-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>\u00b6 189. By twisting the definition of benefits to exclude pension contributions, the majority thereby avoids any substantive analysis of the Contract Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-3\">\u00b6 190. The result of the majority's dodge is the needless diminution of multiple constitutional rights:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-4\">\u2022 The right of freedom of association to organize is diluted as the majority has opened the door for the State to withhold benefits and punish individuals based on their membership in disfavored groups.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-5\">\u2022 Municipalities' right to self-govern as granted by the Home Rule Amendment rings hollow as the majority determines that when the State has budgetary difficulties, matters dealing with local finances are now matters of statewide concern, even absent any showing of an impact on the State budget.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b218-6\">\u2022 And the right to contract is undermined as the majority demonstrates its willingness to creatively interpret a contract in a manner permitting the State to disregard it.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b218-7\">\u00b6 191. I determine that the majority's failure to address the actual issues presented allows it to substitute analyses resulting in conclusions that countenance the violation rather than the protection of constitutional rights. Because I determine that Act 10 unconstitutionally infringes on protected rights, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-8\">\u00b6 192. There are three main issues raised by the parties: (I) the Right To Associate; (II) the Home Rule Amendment; and (III) the Contract Clause. I address each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b218-9\">I. The Right To Associate</p>\n<p id=\"b218-10\">\u00b6 193. Madison Teachers asserts that Act 10 violates the First Amendment right of freedom of associa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>tion by infringing on its right to organize.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Given that the State has conceded that the challenged provisions in Act 10 cannot survive such a constitutional challenge if a strict scrutiny review is applied, the majority has to avoid strict scrutiny to arrive at its result.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> How does it do that? It jettisons the focus of its analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-4\">\u00b6 194. Rather than addressing plaintiffs issue that Act 10 infringes on its constitutional right to <em>organize </em>into a collective bargaining unit, the majority erroneously asserts that plaintiff is claiming a right to <em>bargain </em>as a collective bargaining unit.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It then determines that no such right exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b219-5\">\u00b6 195. In rejecting Madison Teachers' purported claims, the majority stresses that \"[g]eneral employees have no constitutional right to negotiate with their municipal employer.\" Majority op., \u00b6 38. It further states that \"collective bargaining ... is not constitution<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>ally protected.\" <em>Id., </em>\u00b6 39. Accordingly, it determines that \"the plaintiffs' associational rights are <em>in no way implicated </em>by Act 10's modifications to Wisconsin's collective bargaining framework.\" <em>Id., </em>\u00b6 41.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-4\">\u00b6 196. In one instance, the majority appears to acknowledge the plaintiffs actual claim but then distorts it. The majority begins the sentence by correctly referencing \"the 'right' the plaintiffs refer to \u2014 the right to associate with a certified representative.\" <em>Id., </em>\u00b6 37. So far, so good. However, it then ends the sentence with a distortion of the claim, describing the right being asserted as a right \"to collectively bargain on any subject.\" <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b220-5\">\u00b6 197. The majority is well aware that the plaintiff has never asserted that it has a constitutional right to collectively bargain, let alone bargain on any subject. In fact, elsewhere in its opinion, the majority acknowledges that the plaintiff is not arguing a constitutional right to bargain: \"The plaintiffs have insisted at every stage of litigation in this case that they are not arguing a constitutional right exists to collectively bargain.\" <em>Id., </em>\u00b6 39. Yet the majority persists in focusing its analysis on the right to bargain.</p>\n<p id=\"b220-6\">\u00b6 198. The plaintiffs actual argument is based on the well-established premise that there is a constitutional right to organize as a collective bargaining unit. In fact, the United States Supreme Court has declared it to be a fundamental right: <em>\"the right of employees to self-organization and to select representatives of their own choosing for collective bargaining or other mutual protection without restraint or coercion by their employer </em>... <em>is a fundamental right.\" NLRB v. Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Corp., </em>301 U.S. 1, 33 (1937) (emphasis added). Likewise, the Court has stated that the First Amendment most assuredly protects the right of work<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>ers to organize: \"It cannot be seriously doubted that the First Amendment[] guarantees .. . the right [of workers] to gather together for the lawful purpose of helping and advising one another.\" <em>Brotherhood of R.R. Trainmen v. Virginia, </em>377 U.S. 1, 5-6 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b221-4\">\u00b6 199. As early as 1902, the Wisconsin Supreme Court has similarly stressed the \"sacredness\" of the right of employees to organize. <em>State ex rel. Zillmer v. Kreutzberg, </em>114 Wis. 530, 541, 90 N.W 1098 (1902). Against this background, the majority's failure to squarely address the plaintiffs argument is remarkable. In reaching its result the majority appears to ignore over a century's worth of jurisprudence and undermines a right long held sacred in our State.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b221-5\">\u00b6 200. Madison Teachers' argument that Act 10 violates associational rights is twofold. First, it focuses on the provisions in Act 10 requiring collective bargaining units to hold annual recertification elections, eliminating fair share agreements, and prohibiting municipalities from withholding dues from employees' wages. It contends that these provisions violate its associational rights because they infringe on those rights by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>punishing association with a collective bargaining unit. Second, it argues that the provision in Act 10 prohibiting municipalities from bargaining over anything other than an increase in base wages up to the amount of inflation is an unconstitutional condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-4\">\u00b6 201. Rather than considering whether Act 10 discourages the exercise of the associational right to organize, the majority pivots to a different issue advanced by the State and then analyzes that issue. It advances that the State is not required to subsidize speech, and ultimately concludes that the challenged provisions regarding fair share agreements, paycheck dues deductions, and annual recertification do not burden the exercise of associational rights. Majority op., \u00b6\u00b6 54, 59, 61.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b222-5\">\u00b6 202. By pivoting to the issue of whether the constitution requires the State to subsidize speech, the majority avoids the actual argument advanced before this court: whether Act 10 infringes on the associational right to organize by discouraging membership in a collective bargaining unit. Given the void in the majority's analysis, I turn to address the actual issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b222-6\">\u00b6 203. The First Amendment protects not just against State prohibition of association, but also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>against State punishment or penalty for the exercise of associational rights. <em>See Smith v. Arkansas State Highway Emps., Local 1315, </em>441 U.S. 463, 464 (1979) (\"The government is prohibited from infringing upon [First Amendment] guarantees either by a general prohibition against certain forms of advocacy, or by imposing sanctions for the expression of particular views it opposes.\"); <em>Baird v. State Bar of Ariz., </em>401 U.S. 1, 6 (1971) (\"The First Amendment's protection of association prohibits a State from. . . punishing [a person] solely because he is a member of a particular political organization or because he holds certain beliefs.\"). In other words, the State cannot \"tak[e] steps to prohibit or <em>discourage </em>union membership or association.\" <em>Smith, </em>441 U.S. at 466 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b223-4\">\u00b6 204. The United States Supreme Court illustrated this principle in <em>NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson, </em>357 U.S. 449 (1958). <em>Patterson </em>involved a State requirement that NAACP reveal its membership list. The court determined that the State action was \"likely to affect adversely the ability of petitioner and its members to pursue their collective effort[s] [by] . . . inducting] members to withdraw from the Association and dissuad[ing] others from joining it.\" <em>Id. </em>at 462-63. Thus, because the requirement that NAACP reveal its membership list was not supported by a compelling government interest, the court determined that it was unconstitutional. <em>Id. </em>at 466.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-5\">\u00b6 205. Similarly, the provisions in Act 10 discourage organizing as a collective bargaining unit by increasing its cost. Wisconsin Stat. \u00a7 111.70(4)(d) requires collective bargaining units to hold recertification elections annually in which 51% of all eligible employees must vote in favor of recertification. In addition to the costs involved in educating employees about the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>election and convincing employees to vote, collective bargaining units must pay a certification fee. Wis. Stat. \u00a7 111.70(4)(d)3.b.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-4\">\u00b6 206. Further, although collective bargaining units must provide benefits to all members, Act 10 eliminates fair share agreements requiring members to pay their proportionate share of the cost of providing those services.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Wis. Stat. \u00a7 111.70(l)(f), (2). Collective bargaining units' finances are also diminished by Wis. Stat. \u00a7 111.70(3g) which prohibits municipalities from withholding union dues from employees' wages.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">\u00b6 207. By making membership unduly expensive, these Act 10 provisions collectively infringe on the associational right to organize. There is no doubt that these provisions act to discourage membership. The majority's narrow focus on whether the State is required to facilitate free speech shifts the focus from this issue. In doing so, the majority avoids directly addressing the question of whether these provisions impermissibly punish the exercise of the right to associate.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">\u00b6 208. The majority similarly avoids addressing Madison Teachers' second argument, that Act 10 creates unconstitutional conditions. Again, it simply reshapes the argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>\u00b6 209. The majority reasons that because negotiating with employees is not constitutionally required, it cannot be a constitutional violation to withhold such <em>benefits </em>from members of collective bargaining units. Majority op., \u00b6 37-38 (emphasis added). The focus of its analysis is deceptive as the doctrine of unconstitutional conditions does not look at whether the benefit is required. Regardless of whether the benefit is required, the doctrine focuses on whether an individual is required to give up a constitutionally protected right in order to obtain the benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-4\">\u00b6 210. The doctrine of unconstitutional conditions provides that \"the government may not deny a benefit to a person because he exercises a constitutional right.\" <em>Koontz v. St. Johns River Water Mgmt. Dist., </em>133 S. Ct. 2586, 2594 (2013). This doctrine reflects the idea that \"the Constitution's protection is not limited to direct interference with fundamental rights.\" <em>Healy v. James, </em>408 U.S. 169, 183 (1972). Freedoms, such as the right to associate, \"are protected not only against heavy-handed frontal attack, but also from being stifled by more subtle governmental interference.\" <em>Bates v. City of Little Rock, </em>361 U.S. 516, 523 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">\u00b6 211. Even though there may be no constitutional right to a benefit, the State cannot premise receipt of that benefit upon a person foregoing a constitutionally protected right. <em>Bd. of Cnty. Comm'rs v. Umbehr, </em>518 U.S. 668, 674 (1996). Such a condition effectively punishes the free exercise of constitutional liberties, accomplishing indirectly what the State cannot command directly. <em>Sherbert v. Verner, </em>374 U.S. 398, 406 (1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b225-6\">\u00b6 212. The seminal Wisconsin case applying this doctrine is <em>Lawson v. Housing Auth. of Milwaukee, </em>270 Wis. 269, 70 N.W.2d 605 (1955). In <em>Lawson, </em>the court held that it was impermissible for a federal statute to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>condition federal low-income housing on tenants not being members of \"subversive organizations.\" <em>Id. </em>at 274. This was true despite the fact that there was no constitutional right to federal low-income housing.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-3\">\u00b6 213. The court explained that if the government could defend a statute \"on the ground that the plaintiff is being deprived thereby only of a privilege, and not of a vested right, there is extreme danger that the liberties of any minority group in our population, large or small, might be swept away.\" <em>Id. </em>at 275. In other words, once the government has decided to grant a benefit, it cannot condition that benefit on relinquishment of a constitutionally protected right.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-4\">\u00b6 214. The majority pays lip service to this doctrine, but then fails to actually apply it. Majority op., \u00b6\u00b6 29, 38. Its focus on whether the benefit itself is required belies any suggestion that the majority is following the precedent on unconstitutional conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-5\">\u00b6 215. Act 10 is clear: if you have exercised your associational right to organize as a collective bargaining unit you lose your ability to negotiate over anything other than an increase in base wages up to the amount of inflation. Wis. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 111.70(4)(mb), 66.0506, 118.245. This is the textbook definition of an unconstitutional condition. By permitting such a statute to stand, the majority greatly dilutes the First Amendment protection on the right to freedom of association.</p>\n<p id=\"b226-6\">\u00b6 216. Because Act 10 infringes on associational rights to organize by discouraging and punishing membership in collective bargaining units, it can survive strict scrutiny only if it is narrowly tailored to meet a compelling government interest. The State has made no argument that Act 10 is narrowly tailored to meet a compelling government interest and has conceded that it cannot meet this standard. Accordingly, I conclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>that the challenged provisions of Act 10 violate the constitutional right of public employees to organize in a collective bargaining unit.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b227-4\">II. Home Rule</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">\u00b6 217. Next, Madison Teachers challenges the provision in Act 10 which prohibits the City of Milwaukee from making pension contributions on behalf of its employees, Wis. Stat. \u00a7 62.623(1).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> It alleges that this provision violates the Home Rule Amendment.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b228-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>\u00b6 218. The majority responds by shifting the focus to whether Act 10 as a whole implicates a matter of statewide concern. It determines that because the purpose of Act 10 is to alleviate \"fiscal strain,\" the challenged legislation is primarily a matter of statewide concern. Based primarily on fiscal concerns, the majority concludes that Act 10 does not violate the Home Rule Amendment.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Id., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 109,111-15. Over and over again the majority emphasizes that legislation implicating fiscal issues is a matter of statewide concern:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-4\">\u2022 \"[S]tatewide legislation aimed at improving the fiscal health of the State budget is indisputably a general state concern.\" <em>Id., </em>\u00b6 115.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-5\">\u2022 \"[T]he legislature's determination in 1947 that pension and retirement plans are a local concern does not mean it is an accurate portrayal of how pension and retirement plans impact the fiscal realities of Wisconsin in 2014.\" <em>Id., </em>\u00b6 127.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>\u2022 \"The legislature has broad latitude to experiment with economic problems and we do not presume to second-guess its wisdom.\" <em>Id., </em>\u00b6 119.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-4\"><em>See also id., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 111, 118, 120, 122. In other words, when the State has budgetary issues local finances are matters of statewide concerns, even absent any showing of impact on the State budget.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">\u00b6 219. This determination is stunning, not just because of its breadth, but also because it runs counter to the history of the Home Rule Amendment and Milwaukee's pension system, ignores our precedent, and is unsupported by fact. The majority's result substantially strips municipalities of their right to self-govern as granted by the Home Rule Amendment because much of what municipalities do involves \"fiscal matters.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">\u00b6 220. The Home Rule Amendment grants cities and towns the authority to determine their own local affairs, subject only to \"enactments of the legislature of statewide concern as with uniformity shall affect every city or every village.\" Wis. Const, art. XI, \u00a7 3, cl. 1. A review of its history demonstrates that it was enacted in response to calls \"to decrease the role of the state legislature in establishing municipal governments and to provide cities and villages with greater authority to determine their own affairs.\" Kerry A. Burchill, <em>Madison's Minimum-Wage Ordinance, Section 104.001, and the Future of Home Rule in Wisconsin, </em>2007 Wis. L. Rev. 151, 161-62; Robert W Hansen, <em>Municipal Home Rule in Wisconsin, </em>21 Marq. L. Rev. 74, 76 (1937).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>\u00b6 221. Under the Home Rule framework, the funding of a city's pension plan has historically been viewed as primarily local in nature. The legislature recognized this when it authorized Milwaukee to establish its own Milwaukee Employee Retirement System (MERS). \u00a7 31(1), ch. 41, Laws of 1947. It expressly declared Milwaukee's pension system to be \"a local affair\" that should not be construed as a matter of statewide concern:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-4\">For purpose of giving to cities of the first class the largest measure of self-government with respect to pension annuity and retirement systems compatible with the constitution and general law, it is hereby <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>declared to be the legislative policy that all future amendments and alterations to this act are matters of local affair and government shall not be construed as an enactment of state-wide concern.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">\u00a7 31(1), ch. 441, Laws of 1947.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">\u00b6 222. The majority's determination that the funding of Milwaukee's pension system is primarily a matter of statewide concern also ignores precedent. In <em>State ex rel. Brelsford v. Ret. Bd. of the Policemen's Annuity &amp; Benefit Fund, </em>41 Wis. 2d 77, 163 N.W.2d 153 (1968), a constitutional challenge was brought against a Milwaukee charter amendment that permitted retired police officers to receive pensions while working as school teachers. The court determined that pension funds for Milwaukee police officers \"seemQ overwhelmingly to be a matter of predominate local concern.\" <em>Id. </em>at 87.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">\u00b6 223. The court explained that \"the state would have little interest in whether a retired policeman taught school in Milwaukee or in some other municipality. This is a matter of unique interest to Milwaukee.\" <em>Id. </em>Similarly, the court has described \"the control of the locality over payments from the local purse\" as one of a municipality's \"most important\" functions. <em>Van Gilder v. City of Madison, </em>222 Wis. 58, 81-82, 267 N.W 25 (1936).<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b232-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>\u00b6 224. As discussed in <em>State ex rel Ekern v. City of Milwaukee, </em>190 Wis. 633, 641, 209 N.W. 860 (1926), a \"local affair\" is one \"which much more intimately and directly concerns the inhabitants of that community than the casual visitor or the other parts of the state.\" The funding of Milwaukee's pension fund for its city employees fits within this description. The fund is \"entirely self-reliant in both its management and funding.\" Majority op., \u00b6 114. Accordingly, its funding has no demonstrable impact on other parts of the State.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-3\">\u00b6 225. Our jurisprudence is consistent with that of other states that have determined that compensating city employees is primarily a matter of local concern. <em>See, e.g., Bruckshaw v. Paolino, </em>557 A.2d 1221, 1224 (R.I. 1989) (\"the regulation of city employee pensions is of local concern\"); <em>N. Ohio Patrolmen's Benevolent Ass'n v. Parma, </em>402 N.E.2d 519, 525 (Ohio 1980) (\"the ability to determine the salaries paid to city employees is a fundamental power of local self-government.\"); <em>City of Colorado Springs v. State, </em>626 P.2d 1122, 1127 (Colo. 1980) (\"Although the establishment of firemen's pension plans is of statewide concern, the extent to which a home rule city must provide financial support for such a plan is a question intimately involving city budgeting and the assessment and collection of taxes for municipal purposes. These are local and municipal matters.\"); <em>Sonoma Cnty. Org. of Public Emps. v. Cnty. of Sonoma, </em>591 P.2d 1, 13 (Cal. 1979) (\"the wages paid to employees of charter cities as well as charter counties is a matter of local rather than statewide concern.\"); <em>Crawford v. City of Chicago, </em>710 N.E.2d 91, 98 (Ill. App. Ct. 1999) (\"The power to extend to its employees both compensa<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>tion and benefits is ineluctably essential to the operation of local governmental units such as the City in the present case.\").<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\">\u00b6 226. Further undermining its analysis, the majority relies on the broad purpose behind Act 10, rather than the purpose behind the specific statute at issue, Wis. Stat. \u00a7 62.623(1). It does so absent any facts in the record showing that Wis. Stat. \u00a7 62.623(1) does anything to achieve Act 10's purpose or is in any way related to the State budget. Majority op., \u00b6\u00b6 118-23.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">\u00b6 227. The State presented no credible evidence showing that Milwaukee pension expenditures have any impact on the State budget. Although the State pointed to its \"shared revenue\" program, the amounts provided by the State to a municipality under that program are not based on the municipality's budget or expenditures. <em>See </em>Wis. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 79.02, 79.035.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">\u00b6 228. The shared revenue program does not show a relationship between city contributions to city employee pension plans and the State budget. Indeed, even the majority recognizes that the administration of a city's retirement system is \"entirely self-reliant in both its management and funding.\" Majority op., \u00b6 114. There are no facts in the record to determine that Milwaukee's funding of employee pensions has any effect on statewide financial concerns. Accordingly, the majority's determination that Wis. Stat. \u00a7 62.623 concerns primarily a statewide matter is unsupported.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"124\">*124</page-number>\u00b6 229. Having determined that Wis. Stat. \u00a7 62.623 is primarily a statewide matter, the majority declines to analyze what it describes as the second step of a Home Rule challenge: uniformity. <em>Id., </em>\u00b6 94. After devoting several paragraphs to expound on uniformity, <em>id., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 91-95, 98-99, 102-09, the majority makes no attempt to apply its uniformity analysis to the facts of this case. Without any discussion or explanation the analysis simply ends. This presents a significant void in the majority's analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">\u00b6 230. The issues of when and whether a statute applying to a specific set or class of cities is uniform requires a nuanced analysis. <em>State ex rel. Michalek v. LeGrand, </em>77 Wis. 2d 520, 530 n.16, 253 N.W.2d 505 (1977). The concern of targeting individual cities is echoed throughout case law as the court has grappled with the problem of uniformity in the home rule context. <em>See, e.g., id.; State ex rel. Sleeman v. Baxter, </em>195 Wis. 437, 448, 219 N.W 858 (1928); <em>Ekern, </em>190 Wis. at 642. The majority opinion cannot simply wave away these concerns by abruptly ending its analysis. The hole left in the majority's application on this issue further renders its conclusion infirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">\u00b6 231. By determining that Wis. Stat. \u00a7 62.623(1) primarily concerns a statewide matter because it deals with finances, the majority ignores the history of the Home Rule and the Milwaukee pension system, as well as relevant case law, and has greatly narrowed the scope of the Home Rule Amendment. Further, its focus on the purpose behind a broad act, absent any evidence that the specific legislation is actually aimed at affecting that purpose, gives the legislature more leeway to legislate on local issues than was intended by the Home Rule Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"125\">*125</page-number>\u00b6 232. Under the majority's holding it is hard to imagine what is left for municipalities to govern autonomously. Accordingly, for the reasons discussed above, I conclude that the majority has not saved Wis. Stat. \u00a7 62.623(1) from its constitutional challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-4\">III. Contract Clause</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">\u00b6 233. Madison Teachers also asserts that the provision in Act 10 prohibiting Milwaukee from making pension contributions on behalf of its employees violates the Contract Clause of the Wisconsin Constitution.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> It argues that the Milwaukee Charter Ordinance constitutes a contract guaranteeing its right to benefits. Because Act 10 prohibits the benefit of employer funded pension contributions, it contends that Act 10 interferes with its contract rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">\u00b6 234. By twisting the definition of the word \"benefit,\" the majority determines that employer pension contributions are not really benefits at all. As a consequence it is able to exclude the employer contributions, determining that they are not part of the benefit contract as provided in the Milwaukee Charter Ordinance. Accordingly, it concludes that the provision in Act 10 prohibiting Milwaukee from making pension contributions does not violate the Contract Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-7\">\u00b6 235. This analysis is problematic in two respects: (1) it overlooks the language of the Milwaukee Ordinance and (2) it is contrary to the ordinary meaning of the term \"benefit.\" By overlooking language in the ordinance and by demonstrating its willingness to creatively interpret contract terms to avoid finding a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>violation of the Contract Clause, the majority undermines the right to contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-3\">\u00b6 236. Under the Contract Clause, \"[n]o . . . law impairing the obligation of contracts, shall ever be passed.\" Wis. Const, art. I, \u00a7 12. Although the Milwaukee Charter Ordinance provided that the city will make pension contributions to MERS on behalf of its employees, the legislature included in Act 10 provisions prohibiting Milwaukee from making those contributions. Wis. Stat. \u00a7 62.623. Madison Teachers asserts this statute violates the Contract Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">\u00b6 237. Milwaukee's Charter Ordinance provides that Milwaukee will fund member pension contributions to MERS on behalf of its employees. Specifically, it states that \"the city shall contribute on behalf of general city employees 5.5% of such member's earnable compensation.\" Mil. Ch. Ord. \u00a7 36-08-7-a-l.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">\u00b6 238. Next, the ordinance states that employees shall have a benefit contract as provided by the ordinance that shall not be impaired by future legislation:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-6\">Every such member... shall thereby have a benefit contract in ... all... benefits in the amounts and upon the terms and conditions and in all other respects as provided under this [ordinance] . .. and each member and beneficiary having such a benefit contract shall have a vested right to such .. . benefits and they shall not be diminished or impaired by subsequent legislation or by any other means without his consent.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">Mil. Ch. Ord. \u00a7 36-13-2-a.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">\u00b6 239. Then, the ordinance states that employees have a vested contract right to their benefits:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b236-9\">Every member, retired member, survivor and beneficiary who participates in the combined fund shall have a vested and contractual right to the benefits in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>amount and on the terms and conditions as provided in the law on the date the combined fund is created.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b237-4\">Mil. Ch. Ord. \u00a7 36-13-2-g.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">\u00b6 240. The majority acknowledges that those provisions create a contract right to pensions, but determines that they do not create a contract right to pension contributions. Majority op., \u00b6\u00b6 144-45, 156-57. It notes that \"[flor a legislative enactment to be considered a contract, 'the language and circumstances [must] evince a legislative intent to create private rights of a contractual nature enforceable against the State.'\" <em>Id., </em>\u00b6 142 (quoting <em>Wisconsin Prof'l Police Ass'n, Inc. v. Lightbourn, </em>2001 WI 59, \u00b6 145 n.188, 243 Wis. 2d 512). Reasoning that there is no indication that the city council intended to classify pension contributions as benefits, the majority determines that there is no contractual obligation for Milwaukee to make those payments. <em>Id., </em>\u00b6\u00b6 150, 153, 158.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">\u00b6 241. The majority supports its strained interpretation of the term \"benefit\" with a cursory reading of Milwaukee's Charter Ordinance. It suggests that the term \"benefits\" as used in the ordinance, cannot mean pension contributions because Milwaukee's obligation to pay employee contributions \"is conspicuously absent from [the section of the Milwaukee Charter Ordinance titled \"Benefits,\" Mil. Ch. Ord. \u00a7 36-05].\" <em>Id., </em>\u00b6 152.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-7\">\u00b6 242. In reaching its result, the majority overlooks the very first section in the benefits chapter of the Milwaukee Charter Ordinance. Milwaukee Charter Ordinance \u00a7 36-05-1-d specifically incorporates Mil. Ch. Ord. \u00a7 36-08-7, which requires the city to fund the 5.5% member contributions of its employees. It states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b237-8\">The member <em>shall be guaranteed </em>that if the total benefit in the form of a monthly retirement allow<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>anee . .. does not equal the amount of <em>the member's contributions as provided for in s. 36-08-7 </em>[requiring the city to fund those 5.5% member contributions],. .. then the balance of the member's contributions with interest <em>shall be payable </em>in lump sum amount to a designated beneficiary or to an estate entitled thereto.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b238-4\">Mil. Ch. Ord. \u00a7 36-05-1-d (emphasis added).<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b238-5\">\u00b6 243. Indeed, the majority's assertion that pension contributions are not benefits is contrary to the common use of the term \"benefits.\" <em>See, e.g., State ex rel. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number><em>City of Manitowoc v. Police Pension Bd., </em>56 Wis. 2d 602, 612A, 203 N.W.2d 74 (1973) (\"[I]n view of modern day employment inducements, fringe benefits such as insurance premiums, pension fund contributions and perhaps others are to be included in the formula for calculating pension benefits for police and firemen.\"); <em>Titan Tire Corp. of Freeport, Inc. v. United Steel, Paper, &amp; Forestry, Rubber, Mfg., </em>734 F.3d 708, 731 (7th Cir. 2013) (\"They were also receiving an array of fringe benefits, including health care and pension contributions.\"); <em>City of Ft. Wayne v. Ramsey, </em>578 N.E.2d 725, 728 (Ind. Ct. App. 1991) (\"employer-paid pension contributions are in the nature of a fringe benefit\").</p>\n<p id=\"b239-4\">\u00b6 244. Not only is the majority's assertion contrary to the common use of the term, it is contrary to the majority's common experience. Every year the State of Wisconsin sends to its employees a \"Statement of Annual Benefits.\"<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> The benefit of employer pension contributions is among the several benefits listed. For executive branch employees, pension contributions = benefits. For legislative branch employees, pension contributions = benefits. As the majority well knows, for judicial branch employees, pension contributions = benefits. Every State of Wisconsin paycheck stub lists an employer paid pension contribution as a benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b239-5\">\u00b6 245. Nevertheless, the majority persists in twisting the definition of benefit allowing it to creatively interpret a contract in a manner permitting the State to disregard it. The majority rests its conclusion that there is no violation of the Contract Clause on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>analytically unsupportable premise that for Milwaukee, an employer pension contribution is not a benefit.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-4\">\u00b6 246. The majority's strained reading of the term \"benefit,\" excluding employer pension contributions from its definition, is contrary to the use of the term \"benefit\" in the Milwaukee Charter Ordinance and the common use of the term. Accordingly, its analysis of whether the prohibition on employer contributions in Wis. Stat. \u00a7 62.623 violates the Contract Clause does not withstand scrutiny. Allowing Wis. Stat. \u00a7 62.623 to stand undermines the protections of the Contract Clause.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b240-6\">\u00b6 247. In sum, the majority's failure to address the actual issues presented in this case allows it to reach results that countenance the needless diminution of multiple constitutional rights. The right to freedom of association is diluted as the majority has opened the door for the State to withhold benefits and punish individuals based on their membership in disfavored groups. Municipalities' right to self-govern as granted by the Home Rule Amendment now rings hollow as the majority determines that when the State has budgetary concerns, anything dealing with local finances is a statewide matter. And the right to contract is undermined as the majority demonstrates its willingness to creatively interpret a contract in a manner permitting the State to disregard it.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-7\">\u00b6 248.

Normally the role of the majority opinion is to expound on the arguments of the parties and the law, giving only brief attention to the comments of the written dissent. It is unclear if the majority does this in an attempt to deflect attention from its failure to address the associational right to organize. Or, if it is because the majority recognizes that the arguments of the dissent cannot go unaddressed.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b221-6\"> The majority denies stating that employees do not have a constitutional right to organize. Majority op., \u00b6 46. However, its analysis belies this assertion. Madison Teachers argues that Act 10 unconstitutionally interferes with associational rights by burdening and penalizing general employees who elect to organize in a collective bargaining unit. Although the majority acknowledges that at least one of the provisions burdens labor organizations, <em>id. </em>\u00b6 80, it determines that the challenged provisions of Act 10 do not burden associational rights \"because in each instance, there is no constitutional associational right implicated.\" <em>Id., </em>\u00b6 70. Indeed, it stresses this point, stating it \"is vital and bears repeating: the plaintiffs' associational rights are <em>in no way implicated </em>by Act 10's modification to Wisconsin's collective bargaining framework.\" <em>Id., </em>\u00b6 41.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b222-7\"> The majority relies heavily on <em>Wis. Educ. Ass'n Council v. Walker, </em>705 F.3d 640 (7th Cir. 2013), for its position. Majority op., \u00b6 68. However, that case is distinguishable because it considered a different issue than is presented here. <em>Wis. Edu. Ass'n Council </em>examined whether Act 10 burdened the free speech rights of collective bargaining units. 705 F.3d at 645-53. The petitioners asserted that the prohibition on dues deductions constituted viewpoint discrimination because it was imposed only on those collective bargaining units that did not endorse Governor Walker in the prior election. The court did not consider whether Act 10 burdened the right of individuals to organize in a collective bargaining unit.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b224-7\"> Although the majority questions the constitutionality of fair share agreements, majority op., \u00b6 58, the United States Supreme Court recently affirmed that fair share agreements for \"full-fledged state employees\" are constitutionally permissible. <em>Harris v. Quinn, </em>573 U.S. _, *29 (June 30, 2014). <em>Harris </em>dealt with a challenge to fair share agreements brought by personal assistants. The court determined that because personal assistants were not full-fledged public employees they could not be compelled to make fair share payments.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b224-10\"> It is notable that the majority recognizes this as a burden in its discussion of the equal protection claims. Majority op., \u00b6 78.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b227-6\"> Madison Teachers alleges that Act 10 also violates the equal protection clause. It points to the fact that Wis. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 111.70(4)(mb), 66.0506, and 118.245 prevent collective bargaining units from negotiating anything other than base wage increases up to the amount of inflation. Non-members of collective bargaining units are not subject to this restriction. Further, Wis. Stat. \u00a7 111.70(3)(g) prohibits municipalities from withholding dues for collective bargaining units. There is no similar restriction preventing municipalities from withholding dues for other types of organizations.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">As discussed above, the right to organize in a collective bargaining unit is encompassed in the fundamental right to associate protected by the First Amendment. <em>See supra, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 18-19. The challenged provisions of Act 10 implicate those associational rights because they treat employees that are members of a collective bargaining unit differently than employees that are not members of collective bargaining units. As these provisions of Act 10 implicate the fundamental right to associate, strict scrutiny, rather than rational basis review, should be applied to evaluate whether Act 10 violates the equal protection clause.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b227-8\"> Wisconsin Stat. \u00a7 62.623(1) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-9\">Beginning on July 1, 2011, in any employee retirement system of a 1st class city.. . employees shall pay all employee required contributions for funding benefits under the retirement system.

The matter has reached the point today where democracy is in danger of being replaced by imperialism.\" <em>Gas Tax Wanted Home Rule Too, </em>Stevens Point Daily Journal, June 14, 1924, at 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">Similar sentiments were expressed in other newspapers. <em>See, e.g., </em>Joseph E Harris, <em>Questions and Answers, </em>Madison Capital Times, Jan. 19, 1924, Saturday Afternoon Ed., at 9 (\"Home rule secures to cities and villages a larger share in the control over matters of purely local concern. It frees the city or village from a considerable amount of state interference and regulation.\"); <em>Home Rule, </em>Wisconsin Rapids Daily Tribune, Oct. 29,1924, at 4 (\"The meaning of the amendment is briefly stated by the legislative committee of the Milwaukee common council, which is working for its adoption, as follows: The home rule amendment if passed will give villages and cities in Wisconsin broader self-governing powers and leave local affairs to the local governing bodies, without first seeking the authority from the legislature.\").</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">Public statements intended to persuade voters during the ratification process inform the interpretation of a constitutional amendment. <em>Appling v. Walker, </em>2014 WI 96, \u00b6\u00b6 28-37, _Wis. 2d _, 853 N.W.2d 888; <em>see also Dairyland Greyhound Park, Inc. v. Doyle, </em>2006 WI 107, \u00b6 19, 295 Wis. 2d 1, 719 N.W.2d 408.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b231-7\"> <em>Van Gilder </em>created an exception to this general rule for the salaries of police officers, noting that \"the preservation of order, the enforcement of law, the protection of life and property, and the suppression of crime are matters of state-wide concern.\" <em>Van Gilder v. City of Madison, </em>222 Wis. 58, 76, 267 N.W. 25 (1936). As discussed above, this exception did not extend to police pension funds. <em>State ex rel. Brelsford v. Ret. Bd. of the Policemen's Annuity &amp; Benefit Fund, </em>41 Wis. 2d 77, 87, 163 N.W.2d 153 (1968).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b233-7\"> <em>See also </em>Rebecca Hanner White, Robert E. Kaplan, &amp; Michael W Hawkins, <em>Ohio's Public Employee Bargaining Law: Can it Withstand Constitutional Challenge?, </em>53 U. Cin. L. Rev. 1, 31 (1984) (\"The establishment of wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment and decisions pertaining to hiring, promotion, retention, discipline and dismissal of employees are fundamental aspects of local government.\").</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b235-8\"> The Contract Clause provides: \"[n]o bill of attainder, ex post facto law, nor any law impairing the obligation of contracts, shall ever be passed.\" Wis. Const, art. I, \u00a7 12.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b238-6\"> The majority appears to either dismiss or overlook additional sections of the Ordinance: \"Separation Benefits,\" Mil. Ch. Ord. \u00a7 36-05-6-6, and \"Ordinary Death Benefit,\" Mil. Ch. Ord. \u00a7 36-05-6-10. Both likewise reference Milwaukee's contributions to the pension funds. Both reference \"accumulated contributions,\" which is a defined term that incorporates the 5.5% city funded member contributions as set forth in Mil. Ch. Ord. \u00a7 36-08-7.</p>\n<p id=\"b238-7\">The Separation Benefits provision states: \"Should a member cease to be an employee ... he or she shall be paid his or her <em>accumulated contributions </em>as they were at date of separation from service.\" Mil. Ch. Ord. \u00a7 36-05-6-6 (emphasis added). Similarly, the Ordinary Death Benefit provision states: \"Upon receipt of proper proofs of death ... his or her <em>accumulated contributions </em>shall be paid to such person, or such trustee, if any, as he or she has nominated.\" Mil. Ch. Ord. \u00a7 36-05-06-10 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b238-8\">\"Accumulated contributions\" is a defined term in the ordinance, referring to \"the sum of the contributions in the member's account, as provided for in s. 36-08-7-i.\" Mil. Ch. Ord. \u00a7 36-02-1. Section 36-08-7-i of Milwaukee's Charter Ordinance states in relevant part that \"[t]he member's account shall consist of those member contributions deposited in accordance with pars... b.\" Again, paragraph b requires Milwaukee to make contributions on behalf of its employees into their pension account. Mil. Ch. Ord. \u00a7 36-08-7-b. Thus, the majority's reliance on the absence of employer contributions from the benefits chapter of the Milwaukee Charter Ordinance appears misplaced.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b239-6\"> Dep't of Employee Trust Funds, WI Retirement System, Form No. ET-7365.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
