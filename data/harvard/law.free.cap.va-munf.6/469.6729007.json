Depriest.</parties>\n\n\n<summary id=\"b225-17\">This was an action of assumpsit, in the County Court of Nottoway, for sundries sold and delivered. At the trial of the cause, on the plea of non assumpsit, the plaintiff John A. Robertson introduced several witnesses to prove the various items in his account. The defendant\u2019s counsel objected to the introduction of that evidence; on the ground, that, in an action of debt some time before determined between the same parties, one of those witnesses had been examined touching the same items claimed by the plaintiff, to repel or set off the credits then claimed by the defendants, although this suit was at this time pending. And this objection was sustained by the Court, and the testimony accordingly excluded ; to which opinion the plaintiff filed a Bill of exceptions. Verdict and judgment for the defendant.</summary>\n\n\n\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n\n</footnote>\n<opinion><p id=\"b225-15\">Decided, January, 1820.</p><p id=\"b225-16\">i.
