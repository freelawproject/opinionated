After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-23\">I. ORIGINAL DISMISSAL OF COMPLAINT</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-24\">This is Gupta\u2019s second appeal to this Court. Gupta\u2019s first appeal challenged the dismissal of his <em>pro se Bivens </em>complaint in this same case. Gupta\u2019s complaint alleged that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\u201cICE\u201d) officials violated his Fourth and Fifth Amendment rights when they arrested and detained him pending removal proceedings and also searched his apartment and car and seized some of his personal property.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-25\">The district court dismissed Gupta\u2019s complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction based on 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(g). Section 1252(g) deprives federal courts of \u201cjurisdiction to hear any cause or claim by or on behalf of any alien arising from the decision or action by the Attorney General to commence proceedings, adjudicate cases, or execute removal orders against any alien under this chapter.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-26\">On appeal, this Court affirmed. <em>See Gupta v. McGahey, </em>709 F.3d 1062 (11th Cir.), <em>reh\u2019g en banc denied, </em>No. 11-14240 (Nov. 7, 2013). The Court explained that ICE agents sought Gupta\u2019s arrest and detention \u201cwithout bond pending a removal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"985\">*985</page-number>determination because of Gupta\u2019s \u2018escalating delusion\u2019 and continued focus on the Disney World management, the resort\u2019s importance as a \u2018Critical Infrastructure asset,\u2019 and Gupta\u2019s potentially dangerous knowledge [as a Disney World employee] of the resort\u2019s infrastructure.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1064. The Court determined that \u201c[s]ecuring an alien while awaiting a removal determination constitutes an action taken to commence proceedings\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 1252(g), and that \u201c[e]ach of Gupta\u2019s claims allege, as his direct injury, an action taken to secure him and prevent the perceived threat he posed to Disney World while he awaited a deportation hearing.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1065. The Court concluded that, \u201c[b]ecause all of Gupta\u2019s claims challenge actions taken to commence removal proceedings, \u00a7 1252(g) strips the federal courts of subject-matter jurisdiction\u201d to entertain Gupta\u2019s <em>Bivens </em>claims. <em>Id. </em>at 1066.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-4\">II. GUPTA\u2019S TWO POST-JUDGMENT MOTIONS</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-5\">While Gupta\u2019s first appeal was pending, he filed two <em>pro se </em>motions to set aside the district court\u2019s dismissal order and an earlier order denying Gupta\u2019s motion to compel discovery. One of Gupta\u2019s motions cited Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)(3), and the other motion cited Rule 60(d)(3).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Both motions alleged that the defendants had committed fraud by making false representations during discovery about what documents \u2014 in particular all the pages of the multipart Form 1-181\u2014 were in Gupta\u2019s alien file.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1013-9\">The district court denied the two Rule 60 motions. The district court found, <em>inter alia, </em>that: (1) Gupta\u2019s complaints about the Form 1-181 \u201cha[d] nothing whatsoever to do with the Court\u2019s determination that it lack[ed] subject matter jurisdiction\u201d over Gupta\u2019s <em>Bivens </em>claims; (2) nothing about the dispute over the Form 1-181 had prevented Gupta \u201cfrom fully and fairly presenting his position regarding the Court\u2019s subject matter jurisdiction\u201d; and (3) \u201c[m]ore fundamentally, there [was] nothing about the Form 1-181 that would afford any basis for relief from the Court\u2019s order dismissing the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\u201d Gupta then filed this second appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1013-10\">We affirm the district court\u2019s denial of Gupta\u2019s two Rule 60 motions for the reasons given by the district court. As a prior panel of this Court already concluded, the district court properly dismissed Gupta\u2019s <em>Bivens </em>action, pursuant to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>\u00a7 1252(g), for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. As the district court noted, Gupta\u2019s claims of fraud in his Rule 60 motions have no bearing on the district court\u2019s jurisdictional ruling, which has since been affirmed by this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1014-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1013-6\">. Rule 60(b)(3) permits a district court to relieve a party of a judgment on the grounds of \"fraud ..., misrepresentation, or misconduct by an opposing party.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b)(3). Rule 60(d)(3) provides that nothing in Rule 60 limits the district court\u2019s power to set aside a judgment for fraud on the court. Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(d)(3). We review a district court\u2019s denial of a Rule 60(b)(3) motion for an abuse of discretion. <em>Frederick v. Kirby Tankships, Inc., </em>205 F.3d 1277, 1287 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1013-7\">. A Form 1-181 is a \"Memorandum of Creation of Record of Lawful Permanent Residence,\u201d consisting of three copies of the same form. The first page is the \"file copy,\u201d the second page is \"for master index report,\u201d and the third page is \u201cfor adit and statistical reports,\u201d as indicated at the bottom of each page. When completed, the form contains identifying information about the alien and the alien\u2019s immigration status, such as the basis for the alien\u2019s nonimmigrant visa, his priority date, class of admission and port of entry for permanent residence. There are also boxes for immigration officials to record what actions are taken with respect to the alien\u2019s application for adjustment of status. Gupta's motions contended that the defendants lied to a magistrate judge ruling on Gupta\u2019s motion to compel as to whether Gupta's alien file contained all three pages of his Form 1-181 or only the third page, which the defendants produced during discovery.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
