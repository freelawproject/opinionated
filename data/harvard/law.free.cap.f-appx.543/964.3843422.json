On appeal, he argues that: (1) the district court did not say why it made the modification, which it was required to do; (2) the district court is only permitted to make such a modification upon a finding of a violation; (3) supervised release is intended to be rehabilitative, and this modification is punitive because it prevents Williams from having contact with his intimate partner; and (4) the district court did not allow him an opportunity to address the new supervised release condition. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b993-21\">We review a district court\u2019s sentencing decisions for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1188 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b993-22\">The district court is permitted, after considering the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, to \u201cmod<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"966\">*966</page-number>ify, reduce, or enlarge the conditions of supervised release ... pursuant to the provisions of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure relating to the modification of probation and the provisions applicable to the initial setting of the terms and conditions of post-release supervision.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(2). Under the Rules, the district court must hold a hearing before modifying the conditions of supervised release. Fed.R.Crim.P. 32.1(c)(1). At the hearing, the defendant must have \u201cthe right to counsel and an opportunity to make a statement and present any information in mitigation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Rules of Criminal Procedure provide a list of circumstances in which this hearing is not required. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 32.1(c)(2). There is no requirement that the district court make findings of fact to support its modification. Fed.R.Crim.P. 32.1. Indeed, the Tenth Circuit has explained that \u201c[t]here is no clause in subsection (e)(2) which requires the district court to make additional findings before it can modify conditions of supervised release.\u201d <em>United States v. Begay, </em>631 F.3d 1168, 1171-72 (10th Cir.2011), <em>cert. </em>denied,-U.S.-, 131 S.Ct. 3010, 180 L.Ed.2d 834 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b994-6\">As an initial matter, we find no merit to Williams\u2019s claim that the district court did not provide him with an opportunity to address the new supervised release condition. As the record shows, after the district court relayed the modification and asked Williams whether he understood it, it specifically asked Williams if he wanted to say anything else. Williams responded, \u201cNo sir.\u201d Thus, the district court provided him with an opportunity to raise an argument, and he failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-7\">Moreover, the district court did not abuse its discretion when it modified Williams\u2019s supervised release \u2014 by imposing the condition that Williams have no contact with a friend, Emily Smith \u2014 without articulating its reasons. For starters, the record supports the district court\u2019s new condition. When the probation officer alleged that Williams violated his supervised release, the district court held a hearing, and Williams presented evidence and was represented by counsel. At the hearing, evidence was submitted concerning the explosive relationship between Williams and Smith \u2014 evidence that supports the conclusion that the district court\u2019s no-contact condition would protect Williams against future violent encounters with Smith that could lead to violations of other terms of supervised release. What\u2019s more, in modifying Williams\u2019s supervised release, there were no statutory or rule-based requirements that the district court had to follow except to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and there were no statutes or case law that required the district court to make specific findings before modifying the supervised release. As a result, we cannot find any abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
