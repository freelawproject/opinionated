Crager appeals his sentence and contends that the district court erred when it applied a two-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 201.1(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b478-8\">We review the district court\u2019s determination that \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) applies for clear error. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>62 F.3d 723, 724 (5th Cir.1995) (\u201cThe district court\u2019s decision to apply \u00a7 2Dl.l(b)(l) is essentially a factual determination reviewable under the clearly erroneous standard.\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b478-9\">Section 2Dl.l(b)(l) applies when a defendant possesses a dangerous weapon in connection with his offense. The government must prove that the defendant possessed the weapon by a preponderance of the evidence, and it may meet this burden by demonstrating a \u201ctemporal and spatial relationship of the weapon, the drug trafficking activity, and the defendant.\u201d <em>Zapata-Lara, </em>615 F.3d at 390; <em>United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764-65 (5th Cir.2008). The two-level enhancement \u201cshould be applied if the weapon was present, unless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 cmt. n. 3.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-13\">The presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d) reflected the following pertinent facts: (1) in November 2011, Crager stored one-half pound of methamphetamine, two assault rifles, and two handguns in the bed of his truck, PSR \u00b6 12, (2) police searched his truck and found firearm magazines, a loaded pistol, and additional firearms, PSR \u00b6 14, (3) police searched his residence and found fourteen firearms in a safe in his bedroom, PSR \u00b6 15, and (4) police found, among other things, plastic baggies, firearm ammunition, a ballistic vest, and three bags of methamphetamine in the same bedroom as the fourteen guns. PSR \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-14\">On appeal Crager does not dispute that he possessed these weapons. Instead, he argues that is \u201cimprobable that the guns were connected to the drugs\u201d because the guns in his residence were inside a locked safe. Crager\u2019s signed \u201cfactual resume,\u201d however, stipulates that he possessed the methamphetamine found in his residence \u201cwith the intent to distribute it to others.\u201d Because Crager stored the drugs in his residence, it is not \u201cclearly improbable\u201d that the weapons discovered in the same bedroom were connected to this offense. <em>See Eastland, </em>989 F.2d at 770 (affirming application of the enhancement when law enforcement found guns in defendant\u2019s residence and defendant \u201cdealt from his residence\u201d). Further, that Crager\u2019s guns were locked in a safe does not make clearly improbable that the weapons were con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>nected to his offense. <em>See United States v. Castillo, </em>77 F.2d 1480, 1498-99 (5th Cir.1996) (affirming district court\u2019s application of the enhancement when \u201claw enforcement officials discovered in Michael Castillo\u2019s home not only the gun, but also eighteen pounds of marihuana\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Gonzales, </em>458 Fed.Appx. 381, 382 (5th Cir.) (per curiam) (affirming application of the enhancement when \u201cconnection between the firearms found in the locked safe in an upstairs bedroom and Gonzales\u2019s drug-related offense\u201d was not \u201cclearly improbable\u201d), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 132 S.Ct. 2418, 182 L.Ed.2d 1051 (2012).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Finally, the district court did not believe Crager\u2019s testimony at sentencing that he possessed the weapons for legitimate purposes, and this court \u201cwill not disturb a district court\u2019s credibility determination made at sentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Goncalves, </em>613 F.3d 601, 609 (5th Cir.2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b479-7\">In view of this evidence, the district court did not clearly err. It is not \u201cclearly improbable\u201d that Crager\u2019s firearms were connected to his offense. <em>Eastland, </em>989 F.2d at 770.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-8\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b478-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b478-11\">. While \u201cwe examine de novo the district court\u2019s purely legal application of the sentencing guidelines,\u201d <em>United States v. Zapata-Lara, </em>615 F.3d 388, 390 (5th Cir.2010), Crager\u2019s argument on appeal \u201dconcern[s] the specifics of the [district court's] fact finding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, we review the district court's fact finding for clear error. <em>United States v. Eastland, </em>989 F.2d 760, 769 (5th Cir. 1993).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b479-10\">. Moreover, the PSR reflects that in November 2011 Crager stored multiple guns and one-half pound of methamphetamine in the bed of his truck. PSR \u00b6 12. \u201d[A]n offense level may be adjusted under \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) if [the defendant] possessed a gun during the course of related relevant conduct.\u201d <em>United States v. Vaquero, </em>997 F.2d 78, 85 (5th Cir. 1993). Crager\u2019s storage of guns and drugs in his car was relevant and related to his offense of conviction. <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
