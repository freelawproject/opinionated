After applying a 12-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B) because of a pri- or conviction for drug trafficking, the district court sentenced Serrano to a 30-month term of imprisonment; the court did not impose a supervised release term. On appeal, Serrano challenges the 12-level enhancement, arguing that his conviction for conspiracy to commit a federal drug-trafficking offense under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841 and 846 cannot serve as the basis for applying an enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B). According to Serrano, because the Guidelines do not define \u201cconspiracy,\u201d the court must look to the generic definition of conspiracy, which requires an overt act, and \u00a7 846 does not require an overt act.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">As Serrano concedes, his challenge is foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Escareno, </em>700 F.3d 751, 753-54 (5th Cir.2012), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2044, 185 L.Ed.2d 902 (2013), in which we rejected an identical challenge against a 16-level enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i). Serrano raises the issue only to preserve it for further review. In light of <em>Rodriguez-Escareno, </em>the district court did not err at sentencing. Consequently, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b434-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
