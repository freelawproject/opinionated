He argues that his sentence, which was above the advisory Guideline range of 37 to 46 months, was procedurally unreasonable because the district court improperly relied on 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A). He also argues that his sentence was substantively unreasonable because the court\u2019s upward departure was based on \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A), and it failed to acknowledge its consideration of his mitigating arguments. For the reasons discussed below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-14\">The facts here are straightforward and not in dispute. Moore pleaded guilty to several drug-related crimes in 2003, and served around five years in prison. After his release in June 2008, Moore began an 8-year term of supervised release. He violated the terms of his supervised release in December 2010 by possessing and selling cocaine, and failing to notify his probation officer of his questioning by police. He violated the terms again in February 2012 by possessing cocaine and a firearm, and failing to notify his probation officer. The district court held a revocation hearing in January 2013, and sentenced Moore to 60-months imprisonment. The judge asked if there were \u201cany objections from any party as to the findings of fact, the calculation of the sentence, or the manner in which the sentence was pronounced or imposed.\u201d Neither the government nor Moore objected.</p>\n<p id=\"b1028-15\">A sentence imposed for revocation of supervised release is reviewed for reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1001\">*1001</page-number>ableness. <em>United States v. Sweeting, </em>437 F.3d 1105, 1106-07 (11th Cir.2006). We review a district court\u2019s decision to exceed the Guideline range in imposing a sentence upon revocation of supervised release for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>224 F.3d 1237, 1239 (11th Cir.2000). However, when a defendant raises a sentencing argument for the first time on appeal, as Moore has done, review is for plain error. <em>United States v. Aguillard, </em>217 F.3d 1319, 1320 (11th Cir.2000). We correct for plain error when: (1) there is error; (2) the error is plain; and (3) the error affects substantial rights. <em>Id. </em>Error cannot be plain unless it is \u201cclear under current law.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1321 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-4\">Revocation of supervised release is mandatory when the defendant possessed a controlled substance or firearm in violation of the conditions of supervised release. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(g)(1), (2). While the factors for consideration in discretionary revocation specifically exclude \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A), mandatory revocation under subsection (g) contains no such exclusion. <em>See Brown, </em>224 F.3d at 1241-42. When a defendant is sentenced under subsection (g), the only limitation is that the term of imprisonment must not exceed the maximum term of imprisonment authorized under \u00a7 3583(e)(3), which, when the original offense was a class A felony, is five-years imprisonment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3), (g). A district court need not specifically state that it is compelled to revoke supervised release pursuant to subsection (g) if the conditions implicating the provision are present. <em>See Brown, </em>224 F.3d at 1242.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-5\">Because Moore stipulated that he possessed a firearm and a controlled substance in violation of his supervised release, the conditions implicating \u00a7 3583(g) were satisfied, and revocation of his supervised release was mandatory. After not citing to or discussing \u00a7 3583(g) in his opening brief, in his reply brief Moore states that the government\u2019s reliance on this provision \u201cmust fail because at no time during the district court proceedings did the Government, or any other entity, allege or seek to establish that Mr. Moore was subject to mandatory revocation pursuant to \u00a7 3583(g).\u201d But this claim conflicts with Circuit precedent. <em>See Brown, </em>224 F.3d at 1242 (\u201cAlthough not mentioned by the district court, Brown\u2019s revocation was mandatory because he possessed a controlled substance and refused to comply with drug testing.\u201d). The district court did not err in considering \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A), because the factor is not excluded from consideration under \u00a7 3583(g). Moore\u2019s sentence is therefore procedurally reasonable, and we affirm in this respect.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-8\">Next, we examine Moore\u2019s substantive reasonableness challenge. In reviewing a sentence outside the Guideline range, we may consider the degree of variance and the extent of the deviation from the Guidelines. <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1186 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc) (citing <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 47, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594-95, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)). The justification given should be sufficiently compelling to support the degree of variance. <em>Irey, </em>612 F.3d at 1187.</p>\n<p id=\"b1029-9\">Moore argues substantive unreasonableness \u201cbased in large part\u201d on the district court\u2019s consideration of \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A), and also because the court inadequately considered \u201cthe possibility\u201d that he \u201ccould assist the Government in other prosecutions, his rehabilitative efforts, and his family obligations.\u201d As we have discussed, the district court committed no error in considering \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A) in a proceeding under \u00a7 3583(g). The district court also considered Moore\u2019s rehabilitative efforts and family obligations, and determined that repeated violations of his supervised release weighed in favor of a sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1002\">*1002</page-number>above the Guideline range. Although Moore is correct that the district court failed specifically to acknowledge on the record that it had considered his alleged ability to assist in other prosecutions, it was not required to do so. <em>See United States v. Dorman, </em>488 F.3d 986, 938 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-4\">Moore has not demonstrated that his 60-month sentence was substantively unreasonable. He admitted a number of violations of his supervised release, including possession of a controlled substance and firearm. Also, the district court adequately explained its upward variance from the Guideline range based on Chapter 7\u2019s policy statement. The court noted that it felt the sentence was appropriate in light of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, including Moore\u2019s personal characteristics and history. Finally, the sentence was within the statutory limits, supporting its reasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b1030-5\">On this record, Moore\u2019s 60-month sentence was both procedurally and substantively reasonable, and the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
