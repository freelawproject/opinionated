Baker argues that the evidence was insufficient to establish that he violated the conditions of his supervised release by possessing with intent to distribute marijuana, possessing drug paraphernalia, and fleeing or eluding law enforcement. Baker also challenges the procedural reasonableness of his sentence. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1008-20\">The record supports the decision of the district court to revoke Baker\u2019s supervised release. Officer Tony Lipski of the Gainesville Police Department testified that he activated his siren to alert Baker to stop for a traffic offense, but Baker fled from the officer, weaved through travel and bicycle lanes, and drove into oncoming traffic at varying speeds. Lipski observed Baker making \u201cquick furtive movements with his arm ... in a scooping motion\u201d while he was driving. Baker told Lipski that possessing marijuana was a \u201ctrivial violation\u201d before officers discovered in the passenger seat of Baker\u2019s vehicle a backpack containing nine plastic bags of marijuana and approximately $50 in cash. Lip-ski testified that, in his experience, the packaging of the marijuana and its close proximity to the cash suggested that the drugs were intended for distribution. The district court was entitled to discredit Baker\u2019s testimony that he was confused and disoriented when he committed the traffic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>offenses, that the backpack belonged to his girlfriend, Donna Arnold, and that he was unaware of the marijuana in the backpack. And the district court was entitled to treat Baker\u2019s testimony as substantive evidence of his guilt. <em>See United States v. Ellisor, </em>522 F.3d 1255, 1272 (11th Cir.2008). Baker elicited testimony from an investigator and his probation officer that Arnold later claimed the marijuana, but the investigator also testified that Arnold stated that she had told Baker about the marijuana. The district court found that \u201cthe evidence and all inferences that can be drawn from it\u201d proved that Baker had \u201c12 grams or nine baggies\u201d of marijuana \u201cthat he did in fact possess ... with intent to distribute\u201d and that the video \u201csubstantiate^] the testimony of Officer Lipski\u201d about \u201celuding.\u201d The record supports the finding that the government proved by a preponderance of the evidence that Baker possessed marijuana with the intent to distribute, possessed drug paraphernalia, and fled from a police officer. <em>See United States v. Robinson, </em>893 F.2d 1244, 1245 (11th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-4\">Baker\u2019s sentence is reasonable. The district court correctly calculated Baker\u2019s advisory guideline ranges, \u201cconsider[ed] all of the factors set forth in the guidelines,\u201d <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and imposed sentences at the low end of the guideline ranges. The district court revoked Baker\u2019s three terms of supervised release for assault vrith a dangerous weapon during a bank robbery, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2113(a), (d), using a firearm during a crime of violence, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 924(c), and possessing a firearm as a convicted felon, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 922(g). As an armed career criminal, Baker faced a maximum sentence of life imprisonment for possessing a firearm, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 924(e)(1), a Class A felony, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3559(a)(1), for which he faced a longer sentence upon revocation of his supervised release. Baker\u2019s most serious violation of his supervised release, possessing with intent to distribute marijuana, was a Grade A violation, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7Bl.l(a)(l); Fla. Stat. \u00a7 775.084(4)(C)(l)(d), and his advisory guideline range was 24 to 30 months of imprisonment for assault and using a firearm and 37 to 46 months of imprisonment for possessing a firearm. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 7B 1.4(a). The district court advised Baker of the sentencing ranges for a Grade A violation and that he faced a maximum statutory penalty of five years of imprisonment for each of his three violations of supervised release, which also was consistent with being sentenced for a Grade A violation, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3). In response to Baker\u2019s request to reduce his sentence for time served in state custody, the district court varied below the guideline ranges and sentenced Baker to concurrent terms of 20 months for assault, 20 months for using a firearm, and 33 months for possessing a firearm. The district court did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1009-8\">We AFFIRM the revocation of Baker\u2019s supervised release and his sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
