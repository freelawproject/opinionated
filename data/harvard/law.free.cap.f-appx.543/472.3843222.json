The district court granted summary judgment to Hartford on the ground of <em>res judicata </em>based on a judgment in a similar suit in which Pay-ton\u2019s claims were denied. Payton appeals <em>pro se.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b500-17\">In its Order and Reasons, the district court correctly observed that \u201c[t]he instant matter appears to represent an attempt on the part of Plaintiff to supplement her claims from the original law suit with additional documentation.\u201d The court explained that \u201cthe instant suit concerns the same policy, the same alleged injuries and disabling condition, and the same time period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-22\">Payton cannot litigate the same issues twice. The summary judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b500-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
