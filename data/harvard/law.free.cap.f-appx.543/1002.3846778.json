We review the district court\u2019s dismissal for failure to exhaust the IDEA\u2019S administrative remedies de novo. <em>See Babicz v. School Bd. of Broward Cnty., </em>135 F.3d 1420, 1421 (11th Cir.1998) (per curiam). After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-9\">Given the complicated procedural history, we recount it here. In total, the parties to this appeal have been involved in three due process hearings.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We refer to those hearings as \u201cAL I,\u201d \u201cAL II,\u201d and \u201cAL III,\u201d respectively.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-11\">On June 7 and 21, 2010, an Individualized Education Program (IEP) was developed for A.L. A new IEP was later developed on November 17, 2010. On November 24, 2010, prior to the implementation of the November 17, 2010 IEP, Appellants initiated AL I, the first of the three due process hearings, and raised various issues regarding A.L.\u2019s right to FAPE and A.L.\u2019s November 17, 2010 IEP. As a consequence, the November IEP did not take effect and the June IEP became the stay-put IEP for A.L. pursuant to the automatic stay provisions of the IDEA. <em>See </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(j). After numerous hearings, a final order in favor of the Jackson County School Board (JCSB) was entered on December 27, 2012.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-12\">Appellants then initiated AL II in April 2012. AL II concerned many of the same concerns as were challenged in AL I: that A.L. was denied FAPE and that a new IEP had not been implemented since June 2010. In addition, Appellants alleged that JCSB retaliated and discriminated against them. AL II was dismissed without an evidentiary hearing. The- final order was filed in June 2012. This final order is the subject of the instant appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1031-13\">The final due process hearing, AL III, was initiated by JCSB in July 2012. JCSB initiated this hearing to resolve Appellants\u2019 challenges to A.L.\u2019s FAPE and because Appellants wanted to record AL.\u2019s IEP <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1004\">*1004</page-number>meetings. Appellants counterclaimed for retaliation. A final order in favor of JCSB was entered in February 2013.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1032-4\">Appellants filed their complaint with regard to AL II in federal court on September 13, 2012. On October 18, 2012, they amended their federal court complaint. At that time, there had been no final order in either AL I or AL III. JCSB moved to dismiss Appellants\u2019 federal court complaint because: (1) Appellants had not exhausted their administrative remedies as required under the IDEA, and (2) for failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted. The district court granted JCSB\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-5\">Now on appeal, Appellants argue that it was error for the district court to grant JCSB\u2019s motion to dismiss because they had complied with the IDEA\u2019S exhaustion requirements. JCSB argues that we should affirm the district court because Appellants failed to exhaust their administrative remedies as their federal court complaint was filed prior to the entry of a final order in either AL I or AL III. While it is true that there were three separate due process hearings, the claims in AL I and AL III were substantially similar to those in AL II. As such, JCSB argues, by failing to exhaust their administrative remedies in AL I and AL III, Appellants failed to comply with the IDEA and dismissal of AL II was therefore appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-8\">The IDEA guarantees that disabled students receive a FAPE through the provision of various special education services, including an IEP as defined in 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1414(d). <em>See Loren F. ex rel. Fisher v. Atlanta Indep. Sch. Sys., </em>349 F.3d 1309, 1311-12 (11th Cir.2003). A parent who wishes to challenge an IEP, or any matter relating to the provision of a FAPE, may request an \u201cimpartial due process hearing\u201d before an ALJ. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(f).</p>\n<p id=\"b1032-9\">Once the administrative proceedings are complete, the IDEA provides that either party may challenge those proceedings in state or federal court. <em>See </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(i)(2)(A). In order to bring such a challenge, however, the IDEA requires that a plaintiff first exhaust administrative remedies: \u201cbefore the filing of a civil action under such laws seeking relief that is also available under this subchapter, the procedures under subsections (f) and (g) of this section shall be exhausted to the same extent as would be required had the action been brought under this subchapter.\u201d 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(i).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cThe philosophy of the IDEA is that plaintiffs are required to utilize the elaborate administrative scheme established by the IDEA before resorting to the courts to challenge the actions of the local school authorities.\u201d <em>N.B. v. Alachua Cnty. Sch. Bd., </em>84 F.3d 1376, 1378 (11th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1005\">*1005</page-number>Cir.1996) (per curiam) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-5\">We have interpreted the IDEA\u2019S exhaustion requirement as applying to a \u201cbroad\u201d spectrum of claims. <em>See M.T.V., </em>446 F.3d at 1158. In <em>M.T.V., </em>we found that M.T.V.\u2019s parents\u2019 claims based on past retaliation, which included allegations of harassment at IEP meetings, intimidating letters, and needless and intrusive testing of M.T.V., were \u201crelated to\u201d M.T.V.\u2019s education within the meaning of the IDEA and therefore subject to the exhaustion requirement. <em>Id. </em>at 1158-59; <em>see also </em>20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(o) (\u201cNothing in this section shall be construed to preclude a parent from filing a separate due process complaint on an issue separate from a due process complaint already filed.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-7\">Here, the district court dismissed A.L.\u2019s claims for failure to exhaust administrative remedies. We agree that the issues raised in Counts I-V of Appellants\u2019 amended complaint were substantially similar to those issues raised in AL I and AL III. At the time Appellants filed their amended complaint, neither AL I nor AL III had concluded as the ALJ had not yet entered a final order on either matter. Consequently, Appellants failed to exhaust their administrative remedies before bringing this matter to federal court, and therefore it was correctly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1031-10\">. In their complaint, Appellants also sought a petition for a writ of mandamus (Count VI). This count is not addressed in Appellants\u2019 initial brief to this court or in their reply brief. Consequently, we do not address it on appeal. <em>See Access Now, Inc. v. </em>Sw. <em>Airlines Co., </em>385 F.3d 1324, 1330 (11th Cir.2004) (holding that a \u201clegal claim or argument that has not been briefed before the court is deemed abandoned and its merits will not be addressed\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1031-14\">. Under IDEA, disputes between the parents and school boards are resolved through due process proceedings. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(f)(1)(A). A request for a hearing may be made by either the school board or the parents. 20 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1415(b)(6), (f)(1)(A). In Florida, these hearings are conducted by an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) of the Florida Division of Administrative Hearings (DOAH). <em>See </em>Fla. Admin. Code Ann. r. 6A-6.03311.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1032-6\">. JCSB has requested that we take judicial notice of the pleadings from this due process hearing (AL III). Federal Rule of Evidence 201(b) provides that \"[t]he court may judicially notice a fact that is not subject to reasonable dispute because it: (1) is generally known within the trial court\u2019s territorial jurisdiction; or (2) can be accurately and readily determined from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.\u201d The pleadings from AL III are pleadings and orders filed with the Clerk of the Florida DOAH. As such, the facts \"can be accurately and readily determined from sources whose accuracy cannot reasonably be questioned.\u201d <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 201(b). JCSB\u2019s request for judicial notice is GRANTED.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1032-11\">. The exhaustion requirement applies to claims asserting the rights of disabled children under not only the IDEA, but also the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), \u00a7 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Constitution. <em>See M.T.V. v. Dekalb Cnty. Sch. Dist., </em>446 F.3d 1153, 1157-58 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b1033-10\">JORDAN, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A6y\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b1033-11\">Had the issues raised by the appellants in AL II been separate and distinct from the issues raised in AL I, I would agree with the appellants that they could file a federal action once the ALJ entered a final order in AL II. But, as the Court correctly notes, the appellants filed AL II while AL I was pending, and the issues they raised in AL II were largely the same as those presented in AL I. In other words, AL II was duplicative of AL I and was dismissed by the ALJ on that basis. Under the circumstances, the appellants did not exhaust their administrative remedies as to the common issues raised in AL II until the ALJ entered a final order in AL I on December 27, 2012.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
