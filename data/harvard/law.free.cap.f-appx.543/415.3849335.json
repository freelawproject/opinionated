After applying a 16-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i) because of a prior conviction for drug trafficking, the district court sentenced Moreno to a 41-month term of imprisonment followed by a three-year term of supervised release. Moreno now challenges the 16-level enhancement. Because he did not object in the district court, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 712, 714 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b443-21\">Moreno argues that his conviction for conspiracy to commit a federal drug trafficking offense under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841, 846, cannot serve as the basis for applying an enhancement under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i). According to Moreno, because the Guidelines do not define \u201cconspiracy,\u201d the court must look to the generic definition of conspiracy, which requires an overt act, and \u00a7 846 does not require an overt act. As Moreno concedes, his challenge is foreclosed by our decision in <em>United States v. Rodriguez-Escareno, </em>700 F.3d 751 (5th Cir.2012), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2044, 185 L.Ed.2d 902 (2013), in which we rejected the identical argument. Moreno raises the issue only to preserve it for further review. In light of <em>Rodriguez-Escareno, </em>the district court committed no error, plain or otherwise. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b443-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
