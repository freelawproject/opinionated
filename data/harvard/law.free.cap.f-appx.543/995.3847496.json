After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-11\">A grand jury indicted Lord and Shond-rill Nunnally with Hobbs Act robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1951(a) and 2 (Count 1), and with \u201cknowingly us[ing] and carrying] a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence and ... knowingly possessing] said firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence,\u201d in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(ii) and 2 (Count 2). Lord pleaded guilty pursuant to a written plea agreement. The agreement indicated that Count 2 charged \u201cpossession of a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence,\u201d but also stated the charge carried with it a consecutive statutory mandatory minimum 7-years, a sentence that applies only when a defendant not only possesses, but also <em>brandishes </em>a firearm (or abets brandishing), in violation of subsection 924(c)(1)(A)(ii), the statutory section cited in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-13\">Along with the plea agreement, the government filed a factual proffer that said Lord and Nunnally entered a store in Mir-amar, Florida, on September 3, 2012. Nunnally \u201capproached [an] employee from behind, brandished a firearm and demanded money.\u201d Lord \u201cthen walked from the rear of the store and joined Nunnally.\u201d The two took money from the store and left. At Lord\u2019s change-of-plea hearing, the district court asked whether Lord had an opportunity to read the proffer and review it with his lawyer, and Lord said he had. The court asked: \u201cDo you agree that the facts contained in this proffer are true and accurate?\u201d Lord replied: \u2018Tes.\u201d The court asked: \u201cDo you agree that, if the government went to trial, it could prove these facts beyond a reasonable doubt, but today they can establish an independent basis for your guilty plea?\u201d Lord again replied: \u201cYes.\u201d When the court instructed Lord that his guilty plea on Count 2 carried with it a mandatory minimum 7-year term of imprisonment, Lord stated that he understood. The court did not, however, specifically instruct Lord that the 7-year mandatory minimum punishment arose because he was pleading guilty to <em>brandishing </em>a gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b1024-14\">The presentence investigation report prepared in advance of Lord\u2019s sentencing stated that Lord was charged in Count 2 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"997\">*997</page-number>with \u201cpossession and brandishing of a firearm in furtherance of a crime of violence,\u201d in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)(ii), which carried a mandatory 7-year sentence to run consecutively with his sentence on Count 1. Lord objected, contending that, because the indictment did not allege Lord brandished a firearm, he could not be subject to the mandatory sentence a brandishing conviction carried. At bottom, his claim was that, under <em>Alleyne v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 133 S.Ct. 2151, 186 L.Ed.2d 314 (2013),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> to comply with <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000) (and, therefore, Lord\u2019s Sixth-Amendment right to a jury trial), the government had to specifically allege the brandishing element of Count 2 in the indictment and include it in the plea agreement because that element increased the statutory mandatory minimum sentence to which Lord was subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-6\">At sentencing, the district court overruled Lord\u2019s objection and imposed a consecutive 7-year sentence on Count 2. This is Lord\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-8\">We review preserved <em>Apprendi </em>(and, therefore, Alleyne) claims <em>de novo, </em>but reverse only when the error is harmful. <em>United States v. Woodruff, </em>296 F.3d 1041, 1046 (11th Cir.2002). The Supreme Court in <em>Apprendi </em>held that, \u201c[ojther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d 530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348. In <em>Alleyne, </em>the Supreme Court extended <em>Apprendi </em>to apply to any fact that increases the statutory mandatory minimum sentence for a crime. 133 S.Ct. at 2159. And, the Court emphasized, elements that increase punishment must be alleged in the indictment. <em>Id. </em>at 2159-60.</p>\n<p id=\"b1025-12\">There is no doubt that the \u201cbrandishing\u201d element of \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(ii) is what increases the statutory mandatory minimum sentence from 5 to 7 years. <em>Compare </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(i), <em>with id. </em>\u00a7 924(c) (1) (A) (ii). And the parties do not dispute that \u201cbrandishing\u201d was not mentioned in the indictment,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the plea agreement, or during the district court\u2019s Rule 11 plea colloquy.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> But <em>Apprendi </em>and its progeny require any fact that increases punishment \u2014 here, the statutory mandatory minimum \u2014 to be either found by the jury <em>\u201cor admitted by the defendant.\u201d United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 228, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005) (quoting <em>Blakely v. Washington, </em>542 U.S. 296, 303, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004)). In this case, Lord admitted Nun-nally possessed a gun and brandished it to intimidate the store clerk. And he pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting Nunnally in the commission of the offenses, which makes Lord punishable as a principal for any \u201creasonably foreseeable action of\u2019 the crime, including, here, brandishing of a gun during the robbery. <em>United States v. Diaz, </em>248 F.3d 1065, 1099-1100 (11th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"998\">*998</page-number>2001); see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. He does not challenge the aiding-and-abetting charge that accompanies Count 2. Accordingly, although the failure to include \u201cbrandishing\u201d in the indictment and plea agreement and the court\u2019s failure to specifically discuss the element during the plea colloquy was error, it was harmless because Lord admitted responsibility for brandishing a weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1025-9\">. At the time Lord objected, the Supreme Court had agreed to hear, but had not yet decided, <em>Alleyne.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1025-10\"><em>. </em>The subsection for brandishing <em>was </em>included in the indictment. But, because we deem any error harmless, we need not analyze whether the subsection\u2019s mention alone was sufficient.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1025-13\">.It is far from clear that the district court adequately explained the charges Lord faced and to which he was pleading guilty. In any event, because Lord admitted responsibility for Nunnally\u2019s weapon-brandishing, we have no occasion to analyze the court\u2019s colloquy.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
