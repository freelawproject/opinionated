For the first time on appeal, she contends that the district court erred in ordering her to serve a term of supervised release given that she is a deportable alien. She complains that the court failed to make any findings that supervised release was necessary for deterrence or protection, as required by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 501.1(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b444-21\">We review this newly raised argument for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Dominguez-Alvarado, </em>695 F.3d 324, 328 (5th Cir.2012). Gonzalez has failed to show any error, plain or otherwise, in connection with her sentence of supervised release. Section 5Dl.l(c) does not apply where the term of supervised release is required by statute. In the instant case, the district court was required by statute to impose a three-year term of supervised release as a result of Gonzalez\u2019s conviction for distribution of heroin. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b444-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
