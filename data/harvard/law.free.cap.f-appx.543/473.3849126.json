The BIA concluded, relevant to the instant petition, that Torres-Ortega had failed to show that membership in a particular social group (PSG) would be one central reason for any feared future persecution. It also concluded that Torres-Ortega had not shown that he would more likely than not be tortured with the consent or acquiescence of public officials if he were returned to Mexico. The respondent has moved for summary disposition of Torres-Ortega\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-4\">Torres-Ortega\u2019s alleged refugee status was based on his membership in two separate but related PSGs. The first putative group is made up of \u201centrepreneurs and private enterprise owners and their family members.\u201d The second putative group is Americanized individuals returning to Mexico from the United States who are perceived as potentially wealthy. These two groups, he alleged, were at increased risk of kidnapping and extortion by criminal cartels in Mexico.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">In considering whether a PSG exists, the BIA considers \u201c(1) whether the group\u2019s shared characteristic gives the members the requisite <em>social visibility </em>to make them readily identifiable in society and (2) whether the group can be defined with sufficient <em>pariicularity </em>to delimit its membership.\u201d <em>Orellanar-Monson v. Holder, </em>685 F.3d 511, 519 (5th Cir.2012) (emphasis in original) (quotation marks and citation omitted). The BIA\u2019s use of these criteria is permissible, and its interpretation of \u201ca particular social group\u201d based on these criteria is entitled to deference unless it is arbitrary and capricious. <em>Id. </em>at 520-21. In this case, the BIA concluded that the putative PSG of business owners or wealthy people was too broad to be defined with sufficient particularity. It concluded that the putative group of Americanized aliens returning to Mexico was merely a subset of the individuals perceived to have wealth in Mexico, and wealth was not an enumerated ground for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b502-9\">Torres-Ortega asserts that the putative PSG of business owners in Mexico can be defined with sufficient particularity because only a limited number of Mexicans own businesses. He provides no authority for this statement, however, stating only that the shared experience of business ownership would be sufficient to constitute a PSG. He also asserts that the membership of both of his putative PSGs would be limited and finite in a rural area like his hometown of Guanajuato, Mexico. He does not, however, address whether such groups would be as limited and finite in more densely populated areas of Mexico. <em>See Lopez-Gomez v. Ashcroft, </em>263 F.3d 442, 446 (5th Cir.2001) (stating that asylum is not warranted if an alien can safely relocate within his country); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(l)(i)(B), (b)(2)(h).</p>\n<p id=\"b502-10\">We conclude that Torres-Ortega has not shown that the record compels a conclusion contrary to that of the BIA that he was ineligible for asylum. <em>See Chen v. Gonzales, </em>470 F.3d 1131, 1134 (5th Cir. 2006). The standard for receiving withholding of removal is higher than that for receiving asylum. <em>Roy v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 132, 138 (5th Cir.2004). Thus, because Torres-Ortega has not shown eligibility for asylum, \u201ca <em>fortiori, </em>he is ineligi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>ble for withholding of deportation.\u201d <em>Jukic v. I.N.S., </em>40 F.3d 747, 750 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-4\">We turn now to the denial of relief under the CAT. An alien seeking relief under the CAT must show that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured upon return to his home country. <em>Chen, </em>470 F.3d at 1139. Torture is defined as \u201cany act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person ... by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b503-5\">Torres-Ortega challenges the BIA\u2019s determination that he had not shown the required government acquiescence in light of record evidence that the Mexican government was not willfully blind to the cartels\u2019 activities. However, he does not address the BIA\u2019s additional findings that he had not been tortured in the past, that Torres-Ortega was not currently being sought by anyone in Mexico, and that general violence by criminal cartels was insufficient to show an eligibility for relief. Torres-Ortega\u2019s conclusional assertions that he will .be tortured if he returns to Mexico are insufficient to compel a conclusion different from that reached by the BIA. <em>See Chen, </em>470 F.3d at 1134.</p>\n<p id=\"b503-6\">Summary disposition is not appropriate in this case, and the respondent\u2019s motion is thus DENIED. <em>See United States v. Holy Land Found, for Relief &amp; Dev., </em>445 F.3d 771, 781 (5th Cir.2006). However, because the record before us does not compel findings different from those of the IJ or the BIA, <em>see Chen, </em>470 F.3d at 1134; <em>Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 339, 344 (5th Cir.2005), we DISPENSE WITH FURTHER BRIEFING. Torres-Ortega\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b501-27\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
