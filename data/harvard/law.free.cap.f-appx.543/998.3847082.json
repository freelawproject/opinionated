We review de novo a district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008). After a thorough review of the parties\u2019 briefs and the record on appeal, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-21\">In 2004, Jones pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute more than 50 grams of cocaine base; he was held responsible for 597.9 grams. At the time of sentencing, Jones faced a guidelines range of 292 to 365 months and a statutory mandatory minimum of 20 years to life. The government filed a substantial assistance motion, and Jones was ultimately sentenced to 186 months, roughly 64% from the low end of the guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b1026-22\">In 2008, Jones filed a pro se motion for a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) reduction relying on Amendment 706 to the United States Sentencing Guidelines. Because Amendment 706 lowered Jones\u2019s base offense by two levels, his new guideline range was 240 to 293 months. The district court granted Jones\u2019s motion and reduced his sentence to 149 months\u2019 imprisonment, which was 64% of the low end of the amended guideline range.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1027-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"999\">*999</page-number>Jones filed the instant \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion in 2012. Relying on Amendment 750, Jones requested a 57-month reduction in his guideline range and a new sentence within the amended range. The government opposed Jones\u2019s motion, arguing that the bottom of the applicable guidelines range was determined by the 240-month statutory mandatory minimum. Because the 240-month statutory mandatory minimum still applied, Jones\u2019s guideline range had not been lowered by Amendment 750 and the district court lacked jurisdiction to lower his sentence. The district court agreed and denied Jones\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-5\">We agree with the district court and therefore affirm. Section 3582(c)(2) does not provide a basis for a de novo resen-tencing. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 781 (11th Cir.2000). We have held that \u00a7 3582(c)(2) only provides a district court with the discretion to reduce a sentence that was based on a sentencing range that has been lowered by the Sentencing Commission. <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1327 (11th Cir.2008). Where a retroactively applicable Guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his sentence was based, the court is not authorized to grant a sentence reduction pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>United States v. Hippolyte, </em>712 F.3d 535, 540, 542 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. </em>denied,-U.S.-, 134 S.Ct. 181, 187 L.Ed.2d 124, 2013 WL 3063110 (Oct. 7, 2013). The FSA does not apply retroactively to reduce the statutory mandatory minimum for someone sentenced prior to its enactment. <em>Id. </em>at 542.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-8\">Here, Jones\u2019s 240-month statutory mandatory minimum became the bottom of his guideline range when he filed his first \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. Thus, it remained the bottom of his guideline range when he filed his second \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion, and the FSA did not alter the statutory mandatory minimum. Consequently, the district court could not reduce Jones\u2019s sentence under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2); 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(a); <em>Hippolyte, </em>712 F.3d at 540, 542.</p>\n<p id=\"b1027-12\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1026-16\">. Following Jones\u2019s 2008 sentence reduction, we ruled that Amendment 706 was inapplicable to cases involving a guideline range which was lower than the mandatory minimum. <em>United States v. Mills, </em>613 F.3d 1070, 1078 (11th Cir.2010); <em>see United States v. Williams, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"999\">*999</page-number>549 F.3d 1337, 1341 (11th Cir.2008) (per cu-riam)</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
