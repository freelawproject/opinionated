Reversible error has been shown; we affirm in part and vacate in part and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b938-19\">In her complaint, Lemcool \u2014 a follower of the Wiccan faith \u2014 alleged that Defendants violated her First and Fourteenth Amendment rights (1) by requiring inmates to keep tarot decks in the chapel library instead of in the inmate\u2019s cell; (2) by denying Lemcool\u2019s request for a three-ring binder to hold loose handwritten pages of Lemcool\u2019s Book of Shadows; and (3) by denying Lemcool\u2019s requests to schedule Wiccan Holy Days, including Sab-bats and Esbats. Construed liberally,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>Lemcool\u2019s complaint asserts two distinct claims about scheduling Holy Days: (a) that Defendants denied Lemcool\u2019s requests to schedule times for Lemcool to visit the chapel library to use her tarot deck and to conduct private worship rituals on Wiccan Holy Days, and (b) that Defendants failed to schedule Wiccan services in which outside volunteers could participate.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-4\">The district court granted in part and denied in part Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment. The court dismissed Lemcool\u2019s tarot deck and three-ring binder claims on the merits, concluding that no constitutional violation occurred. And the court denied Defendants\u2019 motion to the extent Defendants argued that Lemcool failed to exhaust administratively her Holy Days claim. The court rejected Defendants\u2019 characterization of Lemcool\u2019s Holy Days claim as a claim for <em>\u201cgrowp </em>worship services and activities,\u201d noting that Lem-cool had \u201ccomplained that she should be able to participate in [Holy Day] activities with a Tarot deck in \u2018solitary\u2019 remembrance worship, even without a qualified volunteer for the eight Holy Sabbats, and she requested time and space for such worship.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b939-5\">Defendants later filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that Lemcool\u2019s Holy Days claim should be dismissed as moot because (1) Lemcool was no longer incarcerated at LCI and (2) a change in Chaplaincy Services Procedure provided that religious \u201cservices, activities, and meetings\u201d not supervised by the chaplain could now be supervised by \u201cappropriate staff.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b939-9\">Although the district court explained that Lemcool\u2019s transfer to a different prison did not necessarily moot her entire claim, the court dismissed as moot Lem-cool\u2019s claims against both LCI staff members. The district court then concluded that, furthermore, Lemcool\u2019s Holy Days claim was rendered altogether moot by the statewide change in Chaplaincy Services Procedure. The court reasoned that, the \u201cofficial policy change means that [Lem-cool\u2019s] ability to practice her Wiccan faith is not dependent upon the availability of an outside volunteer and Plaintiff should be able to exercise her First Amendment right to religious freedom.\u201d The district court dismissed the case without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-10\">\n<em>Tarot Deck &amp; Three-Ring Binder</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b939-11\">On appeal, Lemcool argues that Defendants violated her First Amendment rights and discriminated against her in violation of her Fourteenth Amendment rights by not allowing her to keep a tarot deck in her cell and by not allowing her to use a three-ring binder to hold her Book of Shadows.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-12\">We review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>and we view the evidence and all reasonable factual inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. <em>Skop v. City of Atlanta, </em>485 F.3d 1130, 1136 (llth Cir.2007). \u201cSummary judgment is appropriate if the evidence establishes \u2018no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>McCormick v. City of Fort Lauderdale, </em>333 F.3d 1234, 1243 (llth Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"912\">*912</page-number>We apply a \u201cdeferential standard for determining whether a prison regulation violates an inmate\u2019s constitutional rights.\u201d <em>Hakim v. Hicks, </em>223 F.3d 1244, 1247 (11th Cir.2000). \u201cA prison regulation, even though it infringes the inmate\u2019s constitutional rights, is an actionable constitutional violation only if the regulation is unreasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In assessing a regulation\u2019s reasonableness, we consider, among other things, (1) whether the regulation is rationally related to a legitimate governmental interest; (2) whether \u201calternative means of exercising the asserted constitutional right ... remain open to the inmates;\u201d (3) the impact accommodation of the asserted right would have on prison staff, inmates, and the allocation of prison resources; and (4) \u201cwhether the regulation represents an \u2018exaggerated response\u2019 to prison concerns.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1247-48.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">Defendants\u2019 policy prohibiting inmates from possessing tarot cards in their cells is rationally related to a legitimate government interest: prison security. <em>See Singson v. Norris, </em>553 F.3d 660, 662-63 (8th Cir.2009) (upholding a similar prison policy in part because unrestricted tarot cards could be used for \u201cgambling, trafficking, psychological control, and gang symbols\u201d); <em>Mayfield v. Tex. Dep\u2019t of Crim. Justice, </em>529 F.3d 599, 610-11 (5th Cir. 2008) (no First Amendment violation occurred when prison policy prohibited personal possession of runestones because\u2014 like tarot cards\u2014such \u201citems can be used for gambling, trafficking and trading.\u201d). Lemcool has available alternative means of practicing her Wiccan faith, including using a tarot deck in the chapel library. Given the potential safety concerns associated with unrestricted use of tarot cards, accommodating Lemcool\u2019s request to keep a tarot deck in her cell would burden prison staff, other inmates, and prison resources. Because Defendants\u2019 tarot deck policy is not unreasonable, Lemcool has not established an actionable constitutional violation. <em>See Hakim, </em>223 F.3d at 1247.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-6\">About Lemcool\u2019s three-ring binder claim, nothing evidences that Defendants\u2019 denial of a three-ring binder infringed on Lemcool\u2019s First Amendment rights. Lem-cool was allowed to possess and use the loose pages of her Book of Shadows and would be permitted to store them in a folder or envelope without sharp metal components.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-7\">Lemcool has also not shown that being deprived of a three-ring binder constituted an equal protection violation. Although other inmates received three-ring binders through a Christian-based program, the binders were confiscated immediately after prison staff discovered that inmates were forbidden from possessing such binders. Thus, Lemcool has not shown that other prisoners were treated more favorably. <em>See Jones v. Ray, </em>279 F.3d 944, 946417 (11th Cir.2001) (to establish an equal protection violation, an inmate must show, among other things, that \u201c \u2018he is similarly situated with other prisoners who received\u2019 more favorable treatment.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-8\">\n<em>Holy Days</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b940-9\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s determination of mootness. <em>See Troiano v. Supervisor of Elections, </em>382 F.3d 1276, 1282 (11th Cir.2004). A defendant who contends that he has ceased allegedly illegal conduct \u201cbears a heavy burden of demonstrating that his cessation of the challenged conduct renders the controversy moot.\u201d <em>Rich v. Fla. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>716 F.3d 525, 531 (11th Cir.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-10\">The district court concluded that Lemcool\u2019s Holy Day claim was mooted by a change in prison policy which now permits \u201cappropriate staff\u2019\u2014in addition to the chaplain or volunteers\u2014to supervise reli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"913\">*913</page-number>gious activities. But Defendants have not alleged that \u201cappropriate staff\u2019 would in fact be available to supervise Wiccan services on Lemcool\u2019s requested Holy Days. And nothing evidences that the policy change, in and of itself, terminates unambiguously the alleged unconstitutional conduct. <em>See id. </em>For instance, while the old policy language governed who may \u201cconduct,\u201d \u201cestablish[ ],\u201d or \u201cschedule[]\u201d religious services, the revised policy language governs only who may supervise such religious services. We cannot say that this change means that Lemcool is no longer dependent on the availability of outside volunteers. Defendants have not satisfied the \u201cheavy burden\u201d of showing that the policy change mooted Lemcool\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-4\">In addition, because the policy change pertains only to organized religious \u201cservices, activities, and meetings,\u201d it is not pertinent to Lemcool\u2019s claim that Defendants denied her requests to use tarot cards for private worship rituals on Holy Days. The district court erred in concluding that Lemcool\u2019s Holy Days claim was moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">The district court also erred in concluding that Lemeool\u2019s transfer out of LCI mooted her claims against LCI staff members. Because Lemcool was subject to return \u2014 and has, in fact, been transferred back to LCI \u2014 her claims against LCI staff members are not moot. <em>See Hardwick v. Brinson, </em>523 F.2d 798, 800 (5th Cir.1975) (concluding that inmate\u2019s transfer did not moot case when \u201cdefendants were unable to advise that [the inmate] would not be returned to the [complained-of prison].\u201d). We vacate and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-6\">AFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED IN PART AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b938-10\">. We construe liberally <em>pro se </em>pleadings. <em>See Tannenbaum v. United States, </em>148 F.3d 1262, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>1263 (llth Cir. 1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b939-7\">.
