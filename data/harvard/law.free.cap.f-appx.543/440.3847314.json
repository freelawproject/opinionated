Defendants appealed, alleging as their principal argument that the district court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the plaintiffs failed to plead with particularity their claim arising under \u00a7 10(b) of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78j. Reviewing the district court\u2019s findings of fact for clear error and legal issues de novo,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-7\">The district court properly determined that it had subject matter jurisdiction in this case under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 because the suit arose, in substantial part, under \u00a7 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R. \u00a7 240.10b-5. Plaintiffs\u2019 federal claim appears on the face a well-pleaded complaint that satisfies the requirements of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b) and of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. \u201cIt is well-settled that, in order to state a claim under section 10(b) of the 1934 Act and Rule 10b-5, a plaintiff must allege, in connection with the purchase or sale of securities, (1) a misstatement or an omission (2) of material fact (3) made with scienter (4) on which plaintiff relied (5) that proximately caused the plaintiffs\u2019 injury.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AZq\">Here, with respect to the \u00a7 10(b) claim, the complaint alleges that the plaintiffs\u2019 investments were induced by fraud because defendants failed to reveal that they previously had entered into an agreement that effectively prohibited defendants from selling those interests. Additionally, defendants failed to disclose a material judgment entered against them in 2003 that found they breached their contractual, trustee, and fiduciary duties to another investor. The complaint alleges that, had they been aware of these material facts, the plaintiffs would not have invested in the venture and thus suffered harm.</p>\n<p id=\"APq_\">The district court\u2019s findings with respect to defendants\u2019 liability, moreover, were amply supported by the record, and we find no error therein. We affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b469-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
