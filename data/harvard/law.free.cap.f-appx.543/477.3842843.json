Seiffert, on two promissory notes and their accompanying guaranties. The district court granted summary judgment for RBC. Partners and Seiffert appeal, arguing that the district court erroneously considered a RBC account manager\u2019s affidavit as evidence of RBC\u2019s damages. We AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b506-6\">On May 26, 2005, Partners and Lake Houston Walden, LP (\u201cLake Houston\u201d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> executed a promissory note payable to RBC Centura Bank<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> for $1,354,000.00 (the \u201cAtasca Oaks Note\u201d). Partners secured the Atasca Oaks Note with property located in Atascocita, Texas, and Seiffert guaranteed the borrowers\u2019 obligations. On May 12, 2007, Partners and Lake Houston executed another promissory note payable to RBC Centura Bank for $2,350,000.00 (the \u201cLake Houston Note\u201d). The Lake Houston Note was also secured by property located in Texas, and Seiffert again guaranteed payment. RBC was assigned the Atasca Oaks Note, the Lake Houston Note, and their related loan documents. Partners and Lake Walden defaulted on both notes, and RBC foreclosed on the properties. RBC sold the property securing the Atasca Oaks Note on July 7, 2009, and sold the property securing the Lake Houston Note on December 1, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-7\">RBC filed suit, alleging that the foreclosure sales did not recover the principal due under the Notes and Guarantees, and that Partners and Seiffert (\u201cDefendants\u201d) still owed $632,872.72. RBC moved for summary judgment, which Partners and Seif-fert opposed. Partners and Seiffert objected to RBC account manager Daniel Reid\u2019s affidavit, which RBC submitted as summary judgment evidence. They claimed Reid did not provide foundation for his statements concerning the amount owed on the Notes, and did not explain how he computed interest. Without Reid\u2019s affidavit, Defendants argued, RBC did not present evidence of its damages and was not entitled to summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-10\">The district court overruled Defendants\u2019 objection to the Reid affidavit. The court reasoned: \u201cBecause his affidavit was made on personal knowledge by a person competent to testify on the matters stated, it is acceptable summary judgment evidence.\u201d The district court then granted RBC\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-11\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b506-12\">\u201cWe review a grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same standard as the district court.\u201d <em>Haverda v. Hays Cnty., </em>723 F.3d 586, 591 (5th Cir.2013). Summary judgment is proper \u201cif the mov-ant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a). \u201cWe review the district court\u2019s evidentiary rulings for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>King v. Ill. Cent. R.R., </em>337 F.3d 550, 553 (5th Cir.2003); <em>see also St. Romain v. Indus. Fabrication &amp; Repair Serv., Inc., </em>203 F.3d 376, 381 (5th Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">Partners and Seiffert make two arguments attacking the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. First, they argue that the district court erred when it considered Reid\u2019s affidavit. Second, they argue that Reid\u2019s affidavit is insufficient evidence of RBC\u2019s damages. Both arguments fail.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">A. Evidentiary Ruling</p>\n<p id=\"b507-7\">RBC attached Reid\u2019s affidavit to its motion for summary judgment. As outlined in his affidavit, Reid is an RBC \u201caccount manager\u201d and was \u201cauthorized to make th[e] affidavit on behalf of RBC.\u201d As part of his duties for RBC, Reid \u201cmonitor[ed] and collect[ed]\u201d the \u201cpromissory notes at issue in this matter.\u201d In his affidavit, Reid recounted the principal amounts and interest due on both Notes and the amount of money generated from the foreclosure sales. He concluded: \u201cAfter applying the foreclosure bid prices to the outstanding debt due under the Notes, there remains a substantial deficiency,\u201d and that as of the date of RBC\u2019s motion for summary judgment, Appellants\u2019 total debt was $314,133.51 on the Atasca Oaks note and $372,045.90 on the Lake Houston Note.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-8\">Appellants\u2019 object to Reid\u2019s affidavit because it is \u201cconclusory\u201d and because Reid provides no foundation for how he calculated the principal amounts due on the Notes. As the district court noted, Reid\u2019s statements are based on his personal knowledge. <em>See </em>Fed.R.CivP. 56(c)(4) (\u201cAn affidavit or declaration ... must be made on personal knowledge, set out facts that would be admissible in evidence, and show that the affiant or declarant is competent to testify on the matters stated.\u201d). As an account manager at RBC Reid is responsible for monitoring and collecting the Atas-ca Oaks and Lake Houston Notes. Therefore, Reid is competent to testify on the amounts due on the Notes, and his affidavit satisfies the requirements of Rule 56(c)(4). <em>See, e.g., United States v. Lawrence, </em>276 F.3d 193, 196-97 (5th Cir.2001) (holding that a loan analyst\u2019s affidavit based on personal knowledge of certain loan records is admissible summary judgment evidence). Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion when it held that Reid\u2019s affidavit was acceptable summary judgment evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-10\">B. Summary Judgment</p>\n<p id=\"b507-11\">Reid\u2019s affidavit is also sufficient to prove RBC\u2019s damages under Texas law. \u201cA lender need not file detailed proof reflecting the calculations reflecting the balance due on a note; an affidavit by a bank employee which sets forth the total balance due on a note is sufficient to sustain an award of summary judgment.\u201d <em>Hudspeth v. Investor Collection Sens. Ltd. P\u2019ship, </em>985 S.W.2d 477, 479 (Tex.App. 1998); <em>see also Martin v. First Republic Bank, Fort Worth, N.S., </em>799 S.W.2d 482, 485 (Tex.App.1990); <em>8920 Corp. v. Alief Alamo Bank, </em>722 S.W.2d 718, 720 (Tex. App.1986) (\u201cThe affidavit was made on Hollingsworth\u2019s personal knowledge; the notes and guaranty agreement were identified; and the principal balances and interest due were recited. Such statements are clearly not conclusory.\u201d). Reid\u2019s affidavit identifies the principal, interest, fees, the credit applicable from the foreclosure sales, and the remaining deficiencies on the Notes. Accordingly, Reid\u2019s affidavit is sufficient to entitle RBC to summary judgment. <em>See Hudspeth, </em>985 S.W.2d at 479 (\u201cCourts have upheld summary judgments based on affidavits that simply identified a promissory note and a lump sum figure as the principal balance and interest due and owing by the nonmovant on that note.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b507-12\">Appellants rely on <em>Guerra v. M.H. Equities, Ltd., </em>which held that summary <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>judgment was inappropriate when it was \u201cunclear how M.H. Equities calculated [the amount due on the note.]\u201d No. 02-11-00261-CV, 2012 WL 2135596, at *2 (Tex. App. Jun. 14, 2012). But the Court in <em>Guerra </em>found that '\u201cthe summary judgment evidence itself raise[d] a fact issue.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The lenders in <em>Guerra </em>submitted a notice of acceleration showing the balance of the note to be $15,147.38, but an affidavit alleging that the amount owed was $20,644.60. <em>Id. </em>at *1. The court found an issue of fact because \u201c[n]owhere in the summary judgment evidence is the additional $5,000 accounted for.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *2. <em>Guerra </em>is inapplicable because there are no inconsistencies in RBC\u2019s summary judgment evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-4\">Further, Appellants did not provide any controverting summary judgment evidence to the district court. Instead, on appeal, they criticize Reid\u2019s affidavit because he does not explain \u201cwhy the foreclosure sale of the Atasca Oaks note generated $320,000 instead of the strike off amount, and why the foreclosure sale of the Lake Houston Note generated $1,759,895.99 instead of the strike off amount.\u201d But Defendants are required to plead offset as an affirmative defense. <em>See Cabot Capital Corp. v. USDR, Inc., </em>346 S.W.3d 634, 639 (Tex.App.2009) (\u201cThe burden of proof of the fair market value was on Appellees since the offset under Texas Property Code \u00a7 51.003 is an affirmative defense.\u201d). Appellants did not plead offset as an affirmative defense in their answer. Nor did they provide any evidence that the properties were sold at foreclosure for less than fair market value. The district court correctly held, therefore, that there were no genuine disputes as to any material fact and that RBC was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b508-8\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b506-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm.
