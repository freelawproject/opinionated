The BIA determined that Bucio was inadmissible to the United States under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II), because his 2009 Washington conviction for Unlawful Solicitation to Deliver a Controlled Substance qualified as a violation of law related to a controlled substance. Bucio argues, relying on <em>United States v. Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d 712, 714 (5th Cir.2007), that his 2009 conviction did not constitute a violation of law related to a controlled substance because the Washington crime of solicitation is a separate and distinct offense from the state narcotics laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">Although 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C) generally prohibits our review of a final order of removal against an alien who is removable by reason of having committed certain specified criminal offenses, we have jurisdiction to consider the legal question whether Bucio\u2019s past conviction constitutes a violation relating to a controlled substance. <em>See Danso v. Gonzales, </em>489 F.3d 709, 712-13 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">Section 1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) provides that an alien is inadmissible if he has been convicted of or has admitted \u201ccommitting acts which constitute essential elements of\u2019 a violation of a controlled substance law of a state, the United States, or a foreign county. The judgment for Bucio\u2019s solicitation conviction specifically states that the offense involved cocaine and the written and signed Statement of the Defendant on Plea of Guilty to Non-Sex Offense, reflects that Bucio pleaded guilty to Solicitation to Deliver a Controlled Substance, specifically cocaine. Thus, his offense involved a controlled substance. <em>See, e.g., Peters v. Ashcroft, </em>383 F.3d 302, 306-09 (5th Cir.2004). Bucio\u2019s reliance on <em>Gonzales, </em>484 F.3d at 714, is misplaced. Bucio has shown no error in the BIA\u2019s conclusion that his Washington conviction qualified as an offense under \u00a7 1182(a)(2), rendering him inadmissible. See <em>Danso, </em>489 F.3d at 712-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-12\">Bucio additionally argues that, pursuant to the doctrine announced in <em>Rosenberg v. Fleuti, </em>374 U.S. 449, 83 S.Ct. 1804, 10 L.Ed.2d 1000 (1963), he should have been charged as a removable lawful permanent resident rather than as an inadmissible alien because his visit out of the United States was brief, casual, and innocent. As the BIA noted, we have held that the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 superced-ed the <em>Fleuti </em>doctrine. <em>Malagon de Fuentes v. Gonzales, </em>462 F.3d 498, 501 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-13\">Bucio\u2019s petition for review of the order of the BIA is DENIED. In addition, Bu-cio moves for an order directing Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to show cause why this court should not impose sanctions, instruct ICE to return Bu-cio to the United States, or admonish ICE for its usurpation of judicial authority. A stay is not automatic but is an exercise of judicial discretion based on the circumstances of the case. <em>Nken v. Holder, </em>556 U.S. 418, 433-34, 129 S.Ct. 1749, 173 L.Ed.2d 550 (2009). Further, ICE violated no order of this court, and Bucio has produced no evidence that ICE effectuates removals in order to thwart rulings on stay motions. The motion is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b512-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
