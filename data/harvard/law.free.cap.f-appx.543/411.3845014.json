The district court sentenced him to a total term of 360 months of imprisonment, to be followed by a lifetime term of supervised released. Cortez now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">Cortez did not object to the special conditions of his release in the district court. Accordingly, we will review Cortez\u2019s challenges to the conditions for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Ellis, </em>720 F.3d 220, 225 (5th Cir.2013), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(Aug 16, 2013) (No. 13-5918).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">On appeal, Cortez argues that the district court erred by imposing excessively onerous special conditions of supervised release in his case. He contends that the conditions individually and cumulatively are a greater deprivation of liberty than necessary under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(d)(2). Cortez specifically challenges the conditions (1) restricting his use of computers and the internet, (2) banning him from contact with persons under the age of 18, (3) banning him from places where children may frequently congregate, (4) conditionally restricting him from dating or befriending anyone with children under the age of 18 who live at home, (5) banning him from possessing sexually oriented or sexually stimulating materials of adults, (6) banning him from patronizing any place where sexually oriented or sexually stimulating materials are available, and (7) requiring him to participate in treatment programs that may include psycho-physiological testing and prescribed medications.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-14\">Cortez\u2019s challenge to the special condition requiring to participate in treatment programs is not ripe for appeal. <em>See Ellis, </em>720 F.3d at 227. The remaining conditions imposed in Cortez\u2019s case are similar to those this court upheld in <em>Ellis. See id. </em>at 225-27. Cortez has offered no convincing argument to distinguish the conditions imposed in his case from those this court found to be appropriate in <em>Ellis. </em>Given Cortez\u2019s solicitation offense, and the pornography found on his computer, the district court did not err, much less commit plain error, in imposing those conditions. <em>See Puckett v. United States, </em>556 U.S. 129, 135, 129 S.Ct. 1423, 173 L.Ed.2d 266 (2009).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b440-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
