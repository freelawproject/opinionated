After review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-10\">I. MOTION TO SUPPRESS</p>\n<p id=\"b959-11\">With respect to his convictions, Brache argues that the district court erred in denying his pretrial motion to suppress evidence seized from his home. Following an evidentiary hearing, a magistrate judge entered a report and recommendation (\u201cR <em>&amp; </em>R) concluding that Brache\u2019s motion to suppress should be denied. Brache did not file any written objections to the R &amp; R, which the district court adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-13\">We conclude that Brache waived his right to appellate review of the denial of his motion to suppress by not objecting to the magistrate judge\u2019s R &amp; R recommending that the motion to suppress be denied. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 59(b)(2) (providing that the failure to file timely written objections to the R &amp; R \u201cin accordance with this rule waives a party\u2019s right to review\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Garcia-Sandobal, </em>703 F.3d 1278, 1283 (11th Cir.2013) (concluding that defendant who failed to object to magistrate judge\u2019s R &amp; R recommending that defendant\u2019s guilty plea be accepted, waived appellate review under Rule 59(b)(2)).</p>\n<p id=\"b959-14\">Brache argues that because the district court\u2019s order adopting the R &amp; R states that it does so \u201cupon <em>de novo </em>review of the record,\u201d Brache is not precluded from appellate review. To support his argument, Brache cites cases pre-dating the 2005 adoption of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 59. Rule 59, however, does not make any distinction based on whether the district court reviews the R &amp; R, <em>de novo </em>or otherwise; it simply provides that appellate review in this Court is waived if a party fails to object to the magistrate judge\u2019s R &amp; R. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 59 advisory committee\u2019s note (2005) (explaining that the rule\u2019s \u201cwaiver provision is intended to establish the requirements for objecting in a district court in order to preserve appellate review of magistrate judges\u2019 decisions,\u201d but does not affect the district court\u2019s authority to review the R &amp; R \u201cwhether or not objections are timely filed\u201d). Thus, Brache\u2019s reliance on case law that has been superseded by Rule 59 and this Court\u2019s interpretation of this rule is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b959-15\">Even if Brache had preserved this challenge, we would still affirm the district court\u2019s denial of the motion to suppress. It is undisputed that after entering the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"932\">*932</page-number>residence and performing a protective sweep, the officers sat down with Brache at his dining room table. At that time, the officers\u2019 weapons were holstered, they spoke in a conversational tone, and Brache was not handcuffed. The officers gave Brache a copy of his <em>Miranda </em>rights in Spanish, which he then waived. After speaking with an officer in Spanish, Brache was given a written consent form, which explicitly stated that he had the right to refuse to consent to the search. One of the officers translated the consent form into Spanish for Brache. Brache appeared to understand and signed the consent form.</p>\n<p id=\"b960-4\">During the subsequent consent search, officers found drugs in Brache\u2019s bedroom. Even assuming <em>arguendo </em>that law enforcement\u2019s entry into, and protective sweep of, Brache\u2019s residence was illegal, Brache\u2019s subsequent consent to the search was voluntary, and any taint was sufficiently purged by the intervening circumstances in which Brache gave his consent. <em>See United States v. Delaney, </em>502 F.3d 1297, 1309-14 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b960-5\">II. Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b960-6\">Brache also argues that his four concurrent 78-month sentences are unreasonable. We review the reasonableness of a sentence under the deferential abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 41, 128 S.Ct. 586, 591, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We look first at whether the district court committed any significant procedural error and then at whether the sentence is substantively unreasonable under the totality of the circumstances. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1190 (11th Cir.2008).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b960-10\">The abuse of discretion standard \u201callows a range of choice for the district court, so long as that choice does not constitute a clear error of judgment.\u201d <em>United States v. Irey, </em>612 F.3d 1160, 1189 (11th Cir.2010) (en banc) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cIn the face of this [very broad] discretion, it is only the rare sentence that will be substantively unreasonable.\u201d <em>United States v. McQueen, </em>727 F.3d 1144, 1155 (11th Cir.2013). Thus, we ordinarily expect a sentence within the advisory guidelines range to be reasonable. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). The party challenging the sentence bears the burden of proving the sentence is unreasonable in light of the record and the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Id.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We will reverse only if \u201cleft with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"933\">*933</page-number>the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1191 (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b961-5\">In this case, Brache has not demonstrated that his sentence is substantively unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. His total 78-month sentence is within the advisory guidelines range of 63 to 78 months. It is also well below the statutory maximum sentence of twenty years, which is another indication that it is reasonable. <em>See United States v. Gonzalez, </em>550 F.3d 1319, 1324 (11th Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b961-6\">The sentence, moreover, meets the goals encompassed within \u00a7 3553(a). Brache arranged to smuggle 474 grams of cocaine from Honduras to the United States using a DHL parcel. Brache had the parcel addressed to Gustavo Garcia, a man who had merely done yard work for Brache, and then paid another man, Yoelis Santos, $150 to receive the parcel from the DHL delivery driver and bring it to him. In addition to the cocaine found inside the DHL parcel, Brache also had 28.4 grams of cocaine and 10.9 grams of marijuana in his residence. After his arrest, Brache gave sworn statements to investigators that he had nothing to do with the cocaine hidden inside the DHL parcel, which belonged to Santos. However, after Brache was confronted with the drugs found inside his residence, he admitted the drugs were his and to selling drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-7\">At sentencing, the government asked for a sentence at the high end of the advisory guidelines range, or 78 months. Brache asked for one at the low end, or 63 months, arguing that his \u201cactions were occasioned by his regular use of cocaine since 1991.\u201d The district court stated that it had \u201cconsidered the statements of the parties, the presentence report containing the advisory guidelines and the statutory factors\u201d and then imposed a 78-month sentence. The district court explained that it had chosen a sentence at the high end of the range because \u201cthere were some aggravating factors in this case, including the fact that Mr. Brache tried to put this over on, as I recall, someone else initially.\u201d Under the circumstances, we cannot say the district court abused its broad discretion when it imposed a 78-month sentence, at the high end of the guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b961-9\">Brache\u2019s sole argument with respect to reasonableness is that the district court did not \u201cappropriately weigh\u201d his personal characteristics, including his age (48 years old), that he had been married to his wife for thirty years, that he supported his family, that he was disabled after he lost four fingers in a work accident and that he had hypertension. Notably, Brache did not bring these personal facts to the sentencing court\u2019s attention. The facts were, however, presented in the PSI, which the district court stated it had considered. The district court clearly concluded that the aggravating fact that Brache tried to avoid criminal liability by using and then implicating intermediaries outweighed Brache\u2019s personal circumstances. In essence, Brache asks us to second guess the weight the district court accorded each of these factors, which is something we do not do when, as here, the ultimate sentence is reasonable in light of all the circumstances presented. <em>See United States v. Snipes, </em>611 F.3d 855, 872 (11th Cir. 2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b961-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b960-7\">. Although Brache\u2019s brief states that his sentence is both \u201cprocedurally and substantively unreasonable,\u201d it does not challenge the district court\u2019s guidelines calculations or point to any other procedural error at Brache\u2019s sentencing. Nor does Brache\u2019s brief make any substantive argument with regard to procedural reasonableness. Thus, Brache has abandoned any challenge to the procedural reasonableness of his sentence. <em>See United States v. Jernigan, </em>341 F.3d 1273, 1283 n. 8 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b960-8\">.
