Atty., San Francisco, Cal. (Arthur J. Phelan, Morton M.

The crimes charged in the first six counts were allegedly committed more than three years before the date of the indictment. Counts seven to ten, inclusive, alleged violations occurring less than three years prior to the indictment. Appellant plead not guilty to all counts and prior to trial moved for dismissal of counts one to six, inclusive, on the ground that prosecution was barred by the general three year statute of limitations, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3282. The motion was denied and appellant was tried concurrently on counts one to six, and count eight.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The jury returned a verdict of guilty as to count eight only, and found the appellant not guilty as to the remaining counts. From the judgment on the verdict this appeal is taken.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">The principal contention pressed by appellant is that the evidence introduced for the purpose of proving commission of the crimes charged in the allegedly barred counts was inadmissible and that its allowance in evidence constituted prejudicial error. It is urged that the admission of this evidence so infected the jury\u2019s consideration of the charge in count eight as to render the verdict of guilt on that count invalid.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-19\">For the purposes of this decision we need not determine whether the three year statute of limitation was applicable to the offense here charged<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> or whether prejudice might not, under any conceivable circumstances, result from compelling the accused to stand trial upon a number of counts, some of which are barred.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> For we find here, as was held in Marzani v. United States, 83 U.S.App.D.C. 78, 168 F.2d 133, 138, affirmed by an equally divided court, 335 U.S. 895, 69 S.Ct. 299, 93 L.Ed. 431, that the error, if any, in permitting the first six counts to remain in the indictment and go to the jury was harmless. Cf. Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U.S. 750, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 90 L.Ed. 1557. Appellant concedes that the evidence relative to counts one to six was admissible for the limited purpose of tending to show appellant\u2019s knowledge and intent in committing the acts alleged in count eight, Nye &amp; Nissen v. United States, 336 U.S. 613, 618, 69 S.Ct. 766, 93 L.Ed. 919; see 2 Wigmore, Evidence, 3d ed., 1940 \u00a7\u00a7 302-304, but complains that the jury was not instructed as to such limited purpose for which the evidence was to be considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-20\">The record discloses that the jury was accurately and fully instructed that it was to consider evidence tending to show commission of acts similar to those charged in count eight, for the limited purpose of ascertaining appellant\u2019s knowledge and in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>tent.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In view of the adequacy of the instructions, we cannot believe that appellant was prejudiced by 'the receipt of the- evidence as to the acts listed in the first six counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">Another persuasive factor demonstrating the lack of prejudice to appellant by reason of the admission of testimony relative to counts one to six is that, unlike the situation in Marzani, supra, appellant was found innocent as to the allegedly barred counts. The reasonable inference is that the jury disbelieved testimony adduced to prove the crimes charged in those counts. Cf. Culjak v. United States, 9 Cir., 53 F.2d 554, 556; Brown v. United States, 7 Cir., 22 F.2d 293. Appellant asserts that acquittal as to the first six counts was inconsistent with the verdict of guilty as to count eight, and demonstrates that the verdict was the consequence of a compromise compelled by evidence erroneously admitted. We discover no logical inconsistency in a verdict which in effect finds that on a specified date appellant made a false statement under oath and that on other and different occasions he did not. Moreover, it is well settled that an inconsistent verdict does not constitute reversible error. Langford v. United States, 9 Cir., 178 F.2d 48, certiorari denied 339 U.S. 938, 70 S.Ct. 669, 94 L.Ed. 1355; Dunn v. United States, 284 U.S. 390.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Appellant\u2019s other contention is that the statutory crime of which he has been convicted is analogous to the crime of perjury, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1621; that the unique evidentiary rule that perjury must be proved by the testimony of two witnesses or one witness plus corroborating evidence .is applicable, and that this standard of proof was not met. We may assume, without deciding, that such a rule is applicable to the crime here charged <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> and that the scope of the rule embraces not merely the falsity of the statement, but also the fact that the alleged false statement was made,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> for we hold there was evidence corroborating -the testimony, of one witness that appellant <em>made </em>the statement which he admits, if it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>were made, was false. Witness Boland testified that appellant, as charged in the indictment, stated as a witness in the naturalization proceeding of one Puragganan that he had seen the petitioner Puragganan \u201cmonthly, at least\u201d during the period between December 1,1942 and December 1,1946. Clearly corroborative of this testimony that appellant <em>made </em>the statement is the notation on the \u201cPetition for Naturalization\u201d form executed by witness Boland as Naturalization Examiner. This written notation is that \u201cWitness (1)\u201d, who the evidence clearly established to be appellant, stated he had \u201cSince 12/1/42 \u2014 seen [the petitioner Puragganan] monthly to 1945 then daily\u201d. The jury was correctly instructed that the corroborative evidence must be \u201cevidence of itself [which] tends to show that the defendant is guilty as charged.\u201d Cf. Mc-Whorter v. United States, 5 Cir., 193 F.2d 982, 985. It is evident that \u201cthis corroboration of the testimony of [the] single witness [is] such that it supplies independent proof of facts inconsistent with the innocence of the accused,\u201d United States v. Hiss, 2 Cir., 185 F.2d 822, 824, and that it was properly submitted to the jury whose function was to consider its trustworthiness. Weiler v. United States, 323 U.S. 606, 610, 65 S.Ct. 548, 89 L.Ed. 495; see <em>7 </em>Wigmore, Evidence, 3d ed. 1940, \u00a7 2042(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b461-10\">. \u201cIt is hereby made a felony for any alien or other person, whether an applicant for naturalization or citizenship, or otherwise, and whether an employee of the Government of the United States or not \u2014(1) Knowingly to make a false statement under oath, either orally or in writing, in any case, proceeding, or matter relating to, or under, or by virtue of any law of the United States relating to naturalization or citizenship.\u201d Since the date of the alleged offenses the section has been rephrased in Title 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1015.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b461-21\">.

The jury was instructed: \u201cEach count set forth in the indictment charges a separate and distinct offense. You must consider the evidence applicable to each alleged offense as though it were the only accusation before you for consideration, and you must state your finding as to each count in a separate verdict, uninfluenced by the mere fact that your verdict as to any other count or counts is in favor of, or against, the defendant. * * * Evidence showing that on occasions other than those mentioned in one count in the indictment, the defendant committed acts similar to those charged against him in that co\u2019unt may be considered for such bearing, if any, as you may find it to have on issues relating to defendant\u2019s state of mind, that is, on the question of knowledge and intent, in connection with the specific alleged crime for which he is here on trial in that count. Other than this, evidence of the commission of other similar offenses may not be considered by you and is not pertinent in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant as to the charge in any particular count.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-10\">\u201cEach count set forth in the indictment charges a separate and distinct offense. During the trial evidence has been admitted which pertains only to certain counts in the indictment and not to all counts. You are instructed that such evidence is not to be considered in connection with any of the other counts of the indictment in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant. Such evidence is to be considered in your deliberation for the limited purpose for which it was admitted.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b462-12\">.

Appellee' urges that the crime here charged is analogous to the crime defined by the \u201cFalse Statement Act\u201d, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1001, the violation of which it has been held need not be proved by the standards of the \u201ctwo witness\u201d rule. Todorow v. United States, 9 Cir., 173 F.2d 439. Cf. Catrino v. United States, 9 Cir., 176 F.2d 884, holding the \u201ctwo witness rule\u201d . to be inapplicable in a prosecution for alleged violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 241 [now \u00a7 1503], the \u201cObstruction of Justice\u201d statute.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b462-15\">.
