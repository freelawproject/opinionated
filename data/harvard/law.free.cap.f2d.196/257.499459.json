Defendant Denney entered a plea of nolo contenderie. Defendant Bradsher was tried to a jury, found guilty, and sentenced to imprisonment; and he appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-21\">No brief was filed or oral argument submitted on behalf of appellant. Despite the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>apparent abandonment of the appeal, we have examined the record with care. The indictment charged an offense under the statute; the evidence together with the inferences fairly to be drawn from it was abundantly sufficient to establish the charge and sustain the verdict; the instructions of the court were full and fair; and no prejudicial error appears in the record. Accordingly, the judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
