It is, we think, in the examiner\u2019s rather than in the Board\u2019s findings that the result of an impartial, a judicial approach to, and decision of, the questions involved is to be found. That approach maintained throughout by the examiner has produced findings which keep, not to the ear only but also to the hope, the basic promise of the injunction <em>audi altermn partem. </em>It is this promise which, in a judicial or quasi-judicial hearing, demands and, if kept, insures as far as is humanly possible that \u201cknowledge will precede understanding, understanding will precede judging,\u201d and the judgment will be impartial and just. Cf. Keystone Steel &amp; Wire Co. v. N. L. R. B., 7 Cir., 155 F.2d 553; N. L. R. B. v. Sidran, 5 Cir., 181 F.2d 671.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-11\">The action of the majority of the Board in its complete espousal of Hackworth\u2019s cause, its willingness to condone acts both of vulgarity and of violence,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> including the threat of a twenty-four year old bully to slap down a sixty year old sick man, brings to mind a similar stand taken by the Board in earlier and different days, and our disapproval of it. N. L. R. B. v. Williamson Dickie, 5 Cir., 130 F.2d 260.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-12\">The law governing situations of the kind this evidence develops is well settled by the cases.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The fact of union membership does not guarantee against a discharge, though, as appears in the Williamson Dickie case, supra, 130 F.2d at page 263, note 5 both the Board and the Union' there seemed to think that it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b1050-13\">The law governing the consideration to be given to findings of examiner and Board, where they are in conflict is equally well settled.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> An examination of the record as a whole, in the light of these prin<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"999\">*999</page-number>ciples, leaves us in no doubt that the findings and recommendations of the examiner are, the findings and order of the Board are not, supported by it, and that the enforcement of the order should be denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1049-20\">. 93 N.

B. 1616.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b1049-21\">. \u201cThe Trial Examiner heard and observed all the witnesses except Enloe, whose testimony was received in response to written interrogatories propounded to him in Brazil. For this reason and because ho had \u2018lived with the case\u2019, the Trial Examiner was best qualified to decide the credibility of their testimony. Universal Camera Corp. v. N. L. R.

American Thread Co., 5 Cir., 188 F.2d 161.</p>\n<p id=\"b1049-32\">\u201cThe Trial Examiner, who observed the witnesses, credited the four and discredited Bailey; this finding was adopted by the Board. Under these circumstances, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"998\">*998</page-number>the fact that \u2018much of the evidence upon which the Board relied* *was disputed\u2019 affords no basis for overturning the finding.

State Center Warehouse Co., 9 Cir., 193 F.2d 156, where the court observed: \u2018For obvious reasons questions of credibility were for the examiner.\u2019 \u201d \u2014 Brief of Board in N. L. R. B. v. McKee &amp; Co., 5 Cir., 196 F.2d 636.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b1050-8\">. At page 45 of the Record, the Board says: \u201cWe further are unable to credit, as did the Trial Examiner, Homan\u2019s testimony that Thorne was laid off because his pay with overtime was one of the . highest on the payroll, and that Thorne would not have worked without overtime.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b1050-9\">. \u201cWe do not agree with the Trial Examiner\u2019s observation that Hackworth\u2019s \u2018petulance\u2019 in expressing himself in favor of the Union justified Homan\u2019s warning that he would he discharged if he did not discontinue such conduct. The only evidence to support the Trial Examiner\u2019s characterization of Hackworth\u2019s prounion arguments, is the name-calling to which he resorted. We do not consider the language employed by Hackworth on these occasions to have been so obnoxious as to warrant the disciplinary measure invoked by Homan. Employees in an industrial plant do not always resort to polite, parlor room language during the course of a heated union campaign. Majestic Metal Specialties, Inc., 92 N. L. R.
