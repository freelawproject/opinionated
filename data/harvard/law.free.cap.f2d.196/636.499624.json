One of these is the one propounded by the Board. Another is whether the proof satisfied the jurisdictional requirement, that is whether, at Brownsville, respondent was engaged in interstate commerce or its business there substantially affected such commerce. The third, a procedural one, is whether the purported direct appeal to the Board taken by the -General Counsel, after the Examiner had ordered the complaint dismissed for want o\u2018f jurisdiction, was a nullity, as were all the proceedings taken thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-8\">Accepting respondent\u2019s version of the questions that are before us, and proceeding to dispose of them in inverse order, we answer the third and the second questions in the negative. We are in no doubt, under the undisputed evidence and the holdings of the authoritative cases,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> that respondent\u2019s activities were within the jurisdiction. Neither are we in any that such procedural irregularity as there was in the telegraphic appeal to the Board was a \u201cmere technical defect\u201d, Olin Industries, Inc. v. N. L. R. B., 5 Cir., 192 F.2d 799, especially since the Board, later examined the question of jurisdiction on the basis of the entire record, and found, as we find, that there was jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-9\">As to the first question, a comparison of the facts in the case with those in the Daniel Hamm case, N. L. R. B. v. Daniel Hamm Drayage Co., 5 Cir., 185 F.2d 1020, 1021, as they are shown in the decision of the Board in 84 N.L.R.B., 458, and in the briefs on file in this court, in the enforcement proceeding in that case, makes it perfectly clear that here, as was the case there, the finding and order of the Board finds ample support in the evidence considered as a whole.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-15\">Without, therefore, undertaking to set out or subject to analysis the evidence relied on respectively by Board and respondent, we find it sufficient to say that the Board\u2019s order should, and will, be enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-16\">Petition granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b688-21\">. 94 N.
