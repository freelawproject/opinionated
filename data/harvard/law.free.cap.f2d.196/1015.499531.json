The Railroad Company claims it is entitled to payment on a basis of 40,000 and 44,000 pounds. This suit is to recover the difference. No judgment <em>quod recuperet </em>has been entered. The appeal is from the order striking what appellant considers its basic defense, which is that the Railroad Company is not entitled to recover because the shipments are intrastate and the Florida Railroad Commission, the State\u2019s rate making authority, has held the tariffs relied on by plaintiff to be unjust and unreasonable. Other defenses, though perhaps secondary in nature, remain undisposed of in the record. The order appealed from grants defendant Sugar Company leave to amend its answer, and also grants leave to both partic. \"s to amend their pleadings generally.</p>\n<p id=\"b1067-25\">The appellate jurisdiction of the court is defined by statute. Under 28 U.SC.A. \u00a7 1291, only \u201cfinal decisions\u201d are re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1016\">*1016</page-number>viewable.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> A judgment is \u201cfinal\u201d for purposes of appeal only when it terminates the litigation on the -merits, leaving nothing to be done but to enforce the judgment. Lewis v. E. I. DuPont De Nemours &amp; Co., 5 Cir., 183 F.2d 29, 21 A.L.R.2d 757.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-4\">An order merely striking one of several defenses, leaving others on the record, and granting leave to amend, is not a \u201cfinal\u201d decision within the meaning of 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1291. Libbey-Owens-Ford Glass Co. v. Sylvania Industrial Corp., 2 Cir., 154 F.2d 814; Shultz v. Manufacturers &amp; Traders Trust Co., 2 Cir., 103 F.2d 771.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-5\">Appellant points out that the order appealed from constitutes a determination of the basic question here involved. But the views of the district judge implicit in the order have not yet assumed finality. Until final judgment, he is at liberty to alter them.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-8\">The order appealed from does not terminate the litigation, but allows defendant to plead further. It grants no relief to the plaintiff, nor any against the defendant. There are other issues of fact in the case, yet to be determined, before final judgment can be entered. The order is clearly interlocutory, not a final decision, and is therefore not appealable. Compare Crummer Co. v. DuPont, 5 Cir., 196 F.2d 468, and cases therein cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b1068-9\">Dismissed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b1068-6\">. There is of course no contention that the order here in question is within 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1292, authorizing appeals from certain interlocutory orders therein enumerated.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
