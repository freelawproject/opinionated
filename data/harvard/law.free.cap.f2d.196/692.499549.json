Three in number, they are: (1) Did the court err in failing to find, that the lease had terminated according to its provisions, and that petitioner was entitled to possession of the premises free of all claims; <em>(2) </em>If this is not so, did it err in failing to find, that the lease was not timely assumed by the trustee, and to hold that possession of the premises, free of all claims, must, therefore, be delivered to petitioner; (3) If right in both these respects, did not the court err in failing to hold that the option in the lease to purchase the property is limited to a purchase on credit, is, therefore, personal to the lessee, and under the rule of Menger v. Ward, 87 Tex. 622, 30 S.W. 853, cannot be exercised by the trustee or his assigns.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-25\">For the reasons hereafter briefly stated, with respect to each of them, we are of the opinion that a negative answer to the three questions is demanded and that the judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-26\">While it is undisputed that there were serious breaches of the lease, it is also undisputed that no automatic forfeiture was provided for. The answer to the first question, therefore, turns upon the answers to the subordinate ones: (1) Were the written notices given by the lessor, first to the lessee,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and next to the trustee,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"694\">*694</page-number>compliance with the provision<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> for the termination of the lease; and (2) If they were, did the lessee fail to put itself in compliance within the sixty days thereafter provided for in the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-4\">We think it plain that the letter to the lessee was ineffective both because it was not sent to the bankrupt until after the petition for reorganization had been filed and the bankrupt was in possession of the lease under the order of the court as debtor in possession, and because the letter was not, as required in the lease, a notice of termination. It was a mere complaint of conditions, coupled with a statement, not that lessor was exercising his right to terminate but that he was lodging the complaints and reserving for later action in assertion of them all his rights arising thereout.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-5\"> It is settled law that, except where lea\u00e1es provide for automatic cancellation for breaches, these normally furnish bases for claims for damages not for forfeiture, and when, as here, termination is provided for on certain terms, those terms must be strictly and precisely complied with. There was no such compliance here. As to the letter to the trustee, it did not even purport to be the sixty day notice provided for in the lease. It was written in answer to the trustee\u2019s letter of assumption. It was but a reiteration of the position taken in the lessor\u2019s petition filed in the bankruptcy proceeding, that the lease had terminated and lessor was-entitled to retake the premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-8\">We are of the opinion, therefore, that when the Trustee undertook to assume it, though the lease had been breached, it had not been terminated as provided for in it. It was, therefore, existing as a lease and passed to the Trustee as an asset of the bankrupt\u2019s estate. No- effective notice of termination having been given, it is not material to inquire whether the tender of the rent by the trustee was a sufficient tender to prevent forfeiture.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-9\"> ' Since the lease was not assumed within sixty days, the subordinate question, the answer to which furnishes the basis for answering the second question, is whether the order extending the trustee\u2019s time for assumption was legal and binding, as insisted by the trustee, or whether, because of the procedural irregularities asserted, it was, as claimed by appellant, illegal and not binding.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-10\">We are not greatly impressed by the claims of procedural irregularities. Indeed, we think them completely lacking in substance.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-11\">In its claim that the failure' to give it formal notice invalidated the extension order, appellant has, we think, misapprehended the purpose and effect of the statute authorizing the extension. Such an order is one entered in the routine administration of the estate. It may, in the discretion of the referee, be entered with or without notice, and there was therefore no necessity for giving notice<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> of the request. Nor is appellant in a stronger posi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"695\">*695</page-number>tion on its claim that the trustee\u2019s action in assuming the lease was ineffective because the action was not authorized by the referee.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">In the first place, as shown by the referee\u2019s certificate, the action was authorized. In the second place, the statute does not require prior authorization as a condition of a valid assumption. Cf. 11 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 110 sub. (b). All that we held in Green v. Finnigan Realty Co., 5 Cir., 70 F.2d 465, 466, was that \u201cUnder the present Bankruptcy Act, the trustee ought (that is, it was a matter of good practice) to get the authority or ratification of his court.\u201d We did not hold that this was essential to its validity.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b747-6\">Coming to the third and final question, whether the option to purchase the leased premises, contained in the lease, was for credit only and, therefore, personal to the lessee, it is catite plain, we think, from its terms,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> that it was not such an option. In Menger v. Ward, supra, relied on by appellant, the option was precisely and specifically limited to a purchase on credit. Here the option was to purchase it for a specifically named sum, $30,000. The only reference to credit follows the statement that, of this sum, not less than $5000.00 shall be paid in cash, and the balance in five equal annual installments.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-7\">It is quite plain: that the option was not one for credit only; that it was one for cash or credit; and that, a sale for the whole price in cash is in accordance with its terms. Cf. 51 C.J.S., Landlord and Tenant, \u00a7 85, page 645, where the distinction here made is clearly drawn.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-8\">The judgment denying the petition of the lessor was right, and it is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b745-10\">.

We would like to call your particular attention to the fact that the lease in question requires in Article III that the plant for the handling and processing of sulphur be continuously operated. Of course, it has not been so operated and is not being so operated at the present time.
