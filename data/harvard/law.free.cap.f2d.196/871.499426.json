Gray, 90 U.S.App.D.C. -, 197 F.2d 587. Appellant, after being released from the Department of Agriculture in a reduction in force, successfully appealed to the Civil Service Commission. The Department reinstated him, but in a position of lesser salary and responsibility than his former one, which had been abolished. He again appealed to the Civil Service Commission, which held, after investigation, that there was no higher position available for appellant. This suit followed, in which appellant sought a declaration of his rights and an order restoring him to his former job. Thereupon the Commission investigated once more, and again ruled unfavorably to appellant. A hearing was then held in the District Court. The court entered judgment for the defendants (appellees here), concluding that \u201cplaintiff has been accorded all procedural and substantive rights to which he was entitled under the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act of 1944, 5 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 851 et seq. and Civil Service Commission regulations promulgated pursuant thereto.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> That conclusion, amply sup<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>ported in the record, requires affirmance here.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-5\">We think it well to reiterate that in civil service cases the task of the courts is a limited one. Certainly they cannot undertake to pass on a plaintiff\u2019s qualifications for any given post, or to compare them with those of an incumbent. It is not within their province to weigh the merits of a person\u2019s claim to a Federal job.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Congress has established administrative machinery to make these determinations. Where there has been a substantial departure from applicable procedures, a misconstruction of governing legislation, or like error going to the heart of the administrative determination, a measure of judicial relief may on occasion be obtainable.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> But no such basis for relief has here been laid.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-6\">The pertinent provision of Civil Service Regulation 20.9(d), applied by the Commission in this case, required that a veteran of appellant\u2019s status be placed in a position \u201cwhich he could fill without undue interruption to the activity involved. * * *\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We think it followed from the Regulation, and the Commission in effect held, that if by reason of the veteran\u2019s present lack of qualification he could not fill a particular position without appreciable additional training, he would not be entitled to displace an incumbent who was performing the task satisfactorily. Preference applies only within a competing group, Elder v. Brannan, 341 U.S. 277, 71 S.Ct. 685, 95 L.Ed. 939; Fass v. Gray, supra.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> We think the Regulation as interpreted properly served to define the group, and was a valid and reasonable exercise of the Commission\u2019s power to issue rules and regulations under the Veterans\u2019 Preference Act of 1944. See Hilton v. Sullivan, 334 U.S. 323, 334-339, 68 S.Ct. 1020, 92 L.Ed. 1416; Elder v. Brannan, supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b925-8\">The judgment of the District Court will accordingly be</p>\n<p id=\"b925-9\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b924-11\">. The trial court further found, on the evidence adduced, that \u2014 \u201cThe plaintiff has now been given the benefit of two extensive and exhaustive impartial investigations, and his claim has been denied in two separate decisions by the Civil Service Commission. The Commission and its ofiicers considered all evidence and points submitted by the plaintiff in support of his claim before reaching these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"873\">*873</page-number>decisions. * * * The Commission investigated all possible positions \u25a0which plaintiff might have been qualified to fill without undue interruption to the activity involved. The plaintiff was given the full benefit of all available procedures prior to the final determinations denying his claim.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b925-11\">.

No such contention was made by appellant in. the present case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
