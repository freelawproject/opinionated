It may be noted, parenthetically, that the appellant is the sole objector to the plan of reorganization on this appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b268-30\">The appellant\u2019s objections to the reorganization plan were considered by the Interstate Commerce Commission on three occasions and by the District Court and were held in each instance to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b268-31\">On October 24, 1951, subsequent to the entry of the Orher of the District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>on July 12, 1951, approving the plan of reorganization, the Interstate Commerce Commission submitted the plan to creditors for acceptance or rejection. The Commission on January 4, 1952, certified to the District Court the results of the balloting. Its certificate reveals that the plan was accepted 'by at least 96 per cent of each class of creditors to which it was submitted. In two of the classes all the creditors voting accepted the plan.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AV_\">We have given due consideration to the record and the contentions of the appellant, and have arrived at the conclusion that the latter are without, substance. We need add nothing to what has been so well stated by Judge Smith in his analysis of the plan of reorganization and his Order approving it.</p>\n<p id=\"AN2\">The Order of the District Court will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b268-17\">. U.S.C.A. \u00a7 205.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"Ak6\">.
