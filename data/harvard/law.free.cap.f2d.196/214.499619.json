The issues presented by the libel are (a) that the ship was negligent in requiring appellant to hold the can in such pouring and (b) that the ship was unseaworthy in failing to supply a pump to transfer the oil from the drum to the can.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-13\">The court found and concluded that libel-ant had not maintained his burden otf proof on either the issue of negligence or unseaworthiness. On our review of the evidence, given viva voce, we find no manifest error in the court\u2019s decree of dismissal and affirm it.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
