The petition was filed and the writ was issued and served on <em>appellee </em>on June 15, 1951. The petition alleged, in substance, that appellant was, on June 15, 1951, wrongfully held in appellee\u2019s custody. Actually, if appellant was ever in appellee\u2019s custody, he was released on June 15, 1951, before the writ was served. He is not now in custody and has not been in custody since June 15, 1951. Hence the appeal is moot. United States ex rel. Potts v. Rabb, 3 Cir., 141 F.2d 45. Being moot, the appeal is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
