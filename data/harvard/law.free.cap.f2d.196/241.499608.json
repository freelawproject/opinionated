We find no reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-21\">Affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-22\">FAHY, Circuit Judge, dissenting, thinks the registration was properly denied by the Patent Office. His view is that while the marks in general appearance are dissimilar, the use by the plaintiff below of \u201cJOCO\u2019S\u201d as a part of its mark brings it so similar in sound to \u201cJACCO\u201d, part of a mark in prior use, as to be likely to cause confusion or mistake among purchasers within the meaning of 60 Stat. 428 (1946), 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1052(d).</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
