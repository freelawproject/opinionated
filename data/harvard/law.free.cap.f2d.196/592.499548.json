Josserand appealed to the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals. That court reversed the Patent Office. Josserand v. Taylor, 138 F.2d 58, 31 C.C.P.A., Patents, 709. Taylor afterwards filed in that court a petition, based on newly discovered evidence, which the court said was \u201cin effect a bill of review or an application for leave to file a bill of review in the Patent Office, it being claimed that the party Josserand perpetrated a fraud upon this court in the interference proceeding in which priority of the invention, defined by the count in issue, was awarded to him.\u201d Josserand v. Taylor, 159 F.2d 249-250, 34 C.C.P.A., Patents, 824. The Court of Customs and Patent Appeals found that Taylor had failed to show \u201cthat any fraud was committed by appellant Josserand as to any material issue\u201d in the interference proceeding. 159 F.2d at page 256. Accordingly the court denied Taylor\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-10\">Taylor filed amended claims in the Patent Office. These claims are plainly not patentable over the claims involved in the interference proceeding, and were rejected. The Patent Office refused to consider the evidence of fraud offered by Taylor. The District Court dismissed, on the ground of res judicata, appellant's bill in equity subsequently brought under R.S. \u00a7 4915, 35 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 63, to obtain a patent on the amended claims. We think the court was clearly right.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-11\">Josserand\u2019s appeal to the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals was taken under R.S. \u00a7 4911, 35 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 59a. By the express terms of that section that appeal would have been dismissed if the appellee there, appellant here, had elected \u201cto have all further proceedings conducted as provided in section 63 of this title\u201d, i. e. by a bill in equity in the District Court. By not doing that, the present appellant chose to have the dispute between him and Josserand settled in the forum that Josserand had chosen, which was the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals. It is now too late to choose the District Court. The appellant says that the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, despite its broad language which we have quoted above, could not consider \u201cintrinsic fraud\u201d. However that may be, that court\u2019s original decision in Josserand\u2019s favor remains in effect. And \u201cthe decision of the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals, after submission of the case to it without protest, is conclusive as to all the matters adjudicated by it.\u201d Chase v. Coe, 74 App.D.C. 152, 154, 122 F.2d 198, 200.</p>\n<p id=\"b645-14\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
