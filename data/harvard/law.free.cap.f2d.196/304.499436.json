Cf. Broward County, Florida v. Wickman, 5 Cir., 195 F.2d 614.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-15\">In addition, we are in full agreement with the appellant that, under the undisputed facts of record,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> the tax claims <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>of Broward County for 1950 must be paid as expenses of administration, either by the trustee out of the deposited funds, or by Ribbonwriter, who has succeeded to the trustee\u2019s position as to the properties on which the taxes are liens, and, therefore, stands in his shoes as to the obligation to see that they are paid. That this is so is made manifest not only by the express provisions of the invoked section, the authorities cited by appellant, and the Red-wine case, supra, decided by this court, but by the express recognition by Ribbon-writer in its offer to pay, and by the court in the order charging it with, 101/365 of the taxes justly due for the year 1950, for the payment of which the property stands charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">This being so, it is quite clear that, as it was in Redwine\u2019s case, supra, our order must be: Judgment reversed and cause remanded with directions to the court below to consider and determine the claim on its merits and to order paid all of the taxes found to be due Broward County for 1950.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">Reversed and remanded with directions.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b357-13\">. \u201c\u00a7 671.

In July of 1949 certain creditors filed Petition in the Federal Court, asking that Ribbonwriter Corporation of America be adjudged bankrupt. On Sept. 6, 1949, the alleged bankrupt filed an answer asking for an arrangement under Chapt. XI. Subsequently an Order was entered by the Court accepting the plan as set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>forth in the answer. On March 13, 1950, there was subsequently filed a Petition of the Ribbonwriter Corporation of America asking that reorganization be granted under Chapt. X of the Bankruptcy Laws, which said Petition was approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-8\">On March 14, 1950, the District Court approved the Petition for Reorganization under Sec. 10, and appointed L. M. Gerstel as trustee.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-9\">On May 9, 1950, there was a further Order of the Court which classified creditors and stockholders and fixed the time for filing claims to be May 30, 1950. In accordance with the Order of Court there was filed by the Trustee a certificate that he had mailed notice of the May 9th Order to all creditors.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-10\">On July 22, 1950, a plan of reorganization was approved, calling for the creation of a new corporation, Ribbonwriter Corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-11\">On Sept. 5, 1950, there was filed a Petition of the Reconstruction Finance Corp. for reimbursement among other things, of the 1949 taxes which had been paid by it as of May 1, 1950.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-12\">On September 21, 1950, there was entered an Order of confirmation allowing, among other things, Reconstruction Finance Corp. $3,467.93 for advances it had made in paying said taxes, confirming the plan of reorganization as amended, and further vesting all properties and rights in the Ribbonwriter Corp., the new Florida corporation.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-22\">On April 16, 1951, no claim for the taxes having been filed in the reorganization proceedings, W. O. Berryhill, Tax Collector of Broward County, Florida, wrote to Ribbonwriter Corp., requesting the payment of real estate and personal property taxes due for the year 1950. On May 14, 1951, Ribbonwriter Corp. filed its petition for a permanent injunction, restraining W. O. Berryhill from collecting the 1950 real and personal property taxes then claimed as due and owing to him as tax collector, but acknowledging its willingness to pay the said W. O. Berryhill the pro-rate share of taxes it thought was justly due and owing since Sept. 21, 1950, when the Order of Confirmation had been signed and Ribbonwriter Corp. had taken over the assets.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-23\">On June 21, 1951, a permanent injunction was granted, and this appeal followed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
