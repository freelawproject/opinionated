The plaintiff asserts that the value of its name and good will is involved but offered no evidence which would support a finding that their value was $3,000 or more. We, therefore, cannot hold that the court\u2019s finding of fact with respect to the amount in controversy was clearly erroneous. It follows that the complaint was rightly dismissed for want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-4\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
