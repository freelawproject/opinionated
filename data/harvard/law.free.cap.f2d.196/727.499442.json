The taxpayer was incorporated on February 7, 1942 and the Tax Court found that its first taxable year began on that date. 17 T.C. 87.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-31\">The taxpayer asserts that the court erred in this determination and that the evidence establishes that it commenced business as a de facto corporation prior to December 31, 1941.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-32\">It will be observed that the question thus raised is a purely factual one which the Tax Court upon consideration of the evidence has resolved against the taxpayer\u2019s contention. Our examination of the record satisfies us that the evidence supports the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>conclusion of the Tax Court in this regard. Accordingly we cannot say that it is erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-4\">The' decision of the Tax Court will be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">I</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
