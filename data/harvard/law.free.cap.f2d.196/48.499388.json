In each case appellant\u2019s motion for a new trial was based on newly discovered evidence that a prosecution witness had a criminal record. It may fairly be said that with regard to the character of this witness as revealed by evidence at each of appellant\u2019s trials the criminal record of the witness was merely cumulative. Moreover her testimony regarding appellant\u2019s connection with the crimes of which he was convicted was itself merely cumulative. The court did not abuse its discretion in denying a new trial.
