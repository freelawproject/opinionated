The full history of this litigation will be found in Porter v. McRae, 10 Cir., 155 F.2d 213; McRae v. Creedon, 10 Cir., 162 F.2d 989, and McRae v. Woods, Em.App., 165 F.2d 790, certiorari, denied 333 U.S. <em>882, 68 </em>S.Ct. 912, 92 L.Ed. 1157, and it would serve no useful purpose to recount it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-9\">Without enumerating the many pleadings filed, and contentions made, subsequent to the prior litigation, it is sufficient to say that they raise only issues which were presented, tried and finally decided in the former litigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-10\">The trial court correctly decided that the pleadings presented no new issues and its judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
