The Patent Office and the District Court held that as applied to such articles the mark is \u201cdescriptive\u201d and therefore not entitled to registration under the Trade Mark Act of 1905, \u00a7 5, 33 Stat. 725-726, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 85(b).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant appears to be right in its contention that a number of similar trade marks which the Patent Office has registered are equally descriptive. But the fact that the Office has erred in those instances does not mean it should err in this one.</p>\n<p id=\"b644-17\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b644-12\">. The Patent Office proceeding was begun before July 5, 1947. Section 2e of the Trade Mark Act of 1946, 60 Stat. 429, 15 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1052(e), is not applicable to \u201cany suit, proceeding, or appeal then pending.\u201d 60 Stat. 444. Both the old Act and the new use the word \u201cdescriptive\u201d.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
