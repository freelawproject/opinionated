This is not disputed. The appellant\u2019s assignors put froth flotation to practical and successful use in the elimination of contaminants or solid particles from lubricating and cooling emulsions, called lubricating or emulsion coolants. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>The District Court in an action filed by-appellant pursuant to Rev.Stat. \u00a7 4915 (1878), as amended, 35 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 63, found that the discovery of this new usefulness of froth flotation did not amount to patentable invention and dismissed the action. The effect was to leave undisturbed the Patent Office decision that the claims involved are unpatentable in view of the prior art.</p>\n<p id=\"A4c\">We agree. The situation described falls within the principles of Lovell Manufacturing Co. v. Cary, 1893, 147 U.S. 623, at page 634, 13 S.Ct. 472, 476, 37 L.Ed. 307, where the Court said, \u201c * * * the public cannot be deprived of an old process because some one has discovered that it is capable of producing a better result, or has a wider range of use than was before known.\u201d See, also, General Electric Co. v. Jewel Co., 1945, 326 U.S. 242, at page 248, 66 S.Ct. 81, 90 L.Ed. 43.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
