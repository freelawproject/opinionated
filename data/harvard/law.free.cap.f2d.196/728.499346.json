The issues as to the amount of the petitioner\u2019s taxable income for the years in question and as to his fraud are purely factual. The findings of fact of the Tax Court are supported by the evidence and cannot be held to be erroneous. They in turn support the Commissioner\u2019s determinations both as to deficiencies in tax and fraud penalties. Furthermore the court did not err in concluding, under the facts of this case, that resort might properly be had by the Commissioner to the net worth method of determining the petitioner\u2019s income.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-17\">The decision of the Tax Court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
