N.L.R.B. v. Russell Mfg. Co., 5 Cir., 191 F.2d 358.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-25\">To the Board, this discharge was a deliberate act of reprisal for his union activities, a well planned and skilfully executed maneuver to give the false appearance of a discharge for cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b690-26\">To the petitioner, the discharges of Knight and Marutz, under the auspices and at the insistence of Vandivort, respondent\u2019s counsel, for their refusal to retract statements they had made, or were supposed to have made, that what Scovel did was com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"639\">*639</page-number>mon, indeed universal, practice in the plant, known to and permitted or condoned by the management, were the necessary consequences of their having in effect admitted that they, themselves, were guilty of forbidden practices, the penalty for which was discharge.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-5\">To the Board, these lawyer engineered and executed discharges were the final convincing proof that in all that had happened from the beginning of this Union controversy until the end of it, the fine Italian hand of legalism was at work, at the first hidden from view, at the last openly pulling the strings for the dance of the puppets.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-6\">In reply to petitioner\u2019s claim: that, since Scovel was discharged for an assigned cause, the burden was on the Board to show that Smith knew of his union activity, and that it had not done so; the Board insists that the conclusion from this record as a whole is that Smith knew plenty.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-7\">In reply to petitioner\u2019s citation of our recent opinion in N.L.R.B. v. Ray Smith Transport Co., 5 Cir., 193 F.2d 142, the Board points with confidence to the very different record in that case and in this, and to the inescapable conclusion from this record that Smith knew all that was to be known about it.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-8\">To petitioner\u2019s claim: that Vandivort, in pressing King and Marutz for a retraction of their statements while the Scovel charge and complaint against it, as respondent, were pending, was engaged in entirely permissible action; the Board replies that the voice was the voice of Jacob, the hand, the hand of Esau, and that the activities in which he was engaged were forbidden both by the Labor Management Act and by the general considerations which govern public hearings and protect witnesses or possible witnesses thereat from annoyance and high pressuring.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-9\">Finally the Board urges upon us: that, whatever might be said of each of the matters of which it complains, if considered singly and apart, all of them taken together form a mosaic or pattern completely plain and clear, in which the equivocal has become the unequivocal, the uncandid the candid.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-10\">So urging, it insists that no power of divination in Board or Court is needed here \u201cto trace the hidden equities of divine award or to catch sight through the darkness of the fateful threads of woven fire which connect error with its retribution\u201d. There is needed only a knowledge of the facts the record as a whole discloses and the use of right reason to understand and evaluate them.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-12\">We find ourselves in agreement with the view that, whatever may be thought of the case made, if the occurrences are viewed and apprehended piecemeal, viewed and apprehended as a whole, the record fully supports the Board\u2019s findings: that an anti-union coup was planned, and, but for the intervention of the Board, would have been carried out, to eradicate the union and unionism from the plant in Benton Harbor.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-13\">We modify the order, therefore, to restrict it to that plant, by inserting after the words \u201ccease and desist\u201d, the words \u201cat its plant at Benton Harbor, Michigan\u201d, Cf. N.L.R.B. v. Ford Motor Co., 5 Cir., 119 F.2d 326, at page 331 and order it enforced as modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b691-14\">Shell\u2019s petition to set the order aside is denied, the Board\u2019s petition to enforce it is granted.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b690-16\">. These were (1) by means of interrogations and threats to reduce rights or privileges or impose more restrictive conditions, discouraging membership in Oil Workers International Union, C. I.
