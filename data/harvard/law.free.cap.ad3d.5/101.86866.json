However, caution and concern is warranted, and, accordingly, there should be a three-year order of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"102\">*102</page-number>protection with leave to plaintiff to seek further extensions (Domestic Relations Law \u00a7 240 [3] [c]; \u00a7 252 [3]). For lack of objection, defendant failed to preserve his argument that the evidence supporting the finding of child abuse was incompetent hearsay consisting of the children\u2019s out-of-court statements. In any event, were we to reach the issue, we would find that such statements were adequately corroborated and properly considered <em>(see Matter of LeFavour v Koch, </em>124 AD2d 903, 906 [1986], <em>lv denied </em>69 NY2d 605 [1987]). That part of the IAS court\u2019s oral decision imposing a one-year suspended jail sentence on defendant is not reviewable since it was not embodied in the written order on appeal (CPLR 5512 [a]; <em>see Matter of Dean, </em>208 AD2d 1030 [1994]). We have considered and rejected defendant\u2019s other contentions. Concur\u2014Buckley, P.J., Andrias, Lerner and Friedman, JJ.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
