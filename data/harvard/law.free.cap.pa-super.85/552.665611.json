The disagreement was as to the terms of the contract. The plaintiff alleged that he was to receive all that the farm sold for in excess of $5,000, and that the \u00e1sking price was to be $5,500. On the other hand Hart testified that the agreement was that the plaintiff was to have $500 if he sold the farm for $5,500 within two weeks thereafter. If sold after that period plaintiff was to receive less, as defendants were to be compensated for planting a thousand grape roots and doing certain other work; but the exact amount to be paid as commissions was not fixed. According to Hart\u2019s story the arrangement was to expire at the end of sixty days. Plaintiff procured a purchaser at $5,500 about five months later, and sued for $500 commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\">With this conflict of evidence as to the terms of the contract it was not for the court to decide the disputed questions of fact or any of them. Plaintiff presented the following point: \u201cIf the jury believe that the plaintiff during the continuance of his agency procured a purchaser for the defendant\u2019s property who was ready and willing to comply with the defendant\u2019s terms then your verdict should be for the plaintiff for $500,\u201d which the court answered as follows: \u201cThat point is affirmed if you find that there was a contract between the plaintiff and defendants, or either of them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">This assumed as a fact, that if there was a contract between the parties, the plaintiff was entitled to a verdict of $500; regardless of whether the jury believed the plaintiff\u2019s or defendants\u2019 version of its terms. This was error. The second assignment is sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">As the services for which the plaintiff asked compensation were not performed until he was duly licensed as a broker, we find no error in the court\u2019s refusal of the defendants\u2019 motion for judgment non obstante veredicto.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-7\">The judgment is reversed and a new trial awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
