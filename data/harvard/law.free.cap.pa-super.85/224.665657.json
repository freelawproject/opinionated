Insurance against fire and theft was desired and the parties executed a policy-form containing provisions for insurance against other contingencies as well, stamping as \u201cvoid\u201d the provisions presumably unrelated to fire and- <em>theft; </em>to make a slight change in the theft coverage, they added a rider in substitution for the theft provisions of the policy-form. The rider specified that it was \u201csubject to all the other provisions and conditions of this policy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">The automobile was .stolen. Due notice was given, and the car not being-recovered, defendant claimed the right to replace the car with one like it, or, if plaintiff declined that, to pay the value of such a car at the time of theft. This value was averred to be $700. Plaintiff refused the proposal, contending that by the contract the amount payable was $1,106.50.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">The theft provisions in the policy-form and in the rider are' the same, except that the rider omits' that \u201ceach claim on account of theft, .robbery or pilferage...... shall be adjusted separately and from the amount of each Such claim, when determined, if the loss or damage incurred is partial only, there should be deducted the sum of $25, and the association shall be liable for the loss in excess of that amount only, but if the loss or damage incurred is total, this deduction shall not be made.\u201d The apparent\" purpose of the-rider then was to eliminate that provision of the policy-form from the- contract of the parties;</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">The rider provides (as did the original form) \u201cif the property stolen shall not be found within such-period, [not now material] it shall be paid for as a total loss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>and in that event, if it, or any part of it, be subsequently found and recovered, it shall become the property of the association......\u201d Plaintiff claims under that provision for a total loss. The rider also provides (as did -the original form) : \u201cThe maximum amount of insurance allowed shall be determined according to the following scale:......On an automobile on which the association allows a special amount of insurance, [the amount here was $ 1,340] the policy shall carry an automatic monthly depreciation of <em>2yz% </em>of the face of the policy from the date the insurance takes effect,......\u201cThe amount claimed by plaintiff and for which judgment was entered was calculated under that provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">Defendant contends that as the rider was \u201csubject to all other conditions of this policy,\u201d it is not bound to pay under the foregoing provisions, but may act under a general provision in the policy as follows: \u201cLiability of Association. D. The Association shall not be liable beyond the actual cash value of the property destroyed or damaged as of the time of destruction, loss or damage; and the loss or damage shall be \u00e1scertained or estimated according to such actual cash value, with proper deductions for depreciation, however caused, and. in no event shall exceed what it would then cost to repair or replace the same with material or parts of like kind and quality; ......\u201d \u201cIt shall be optional, however, with the Association to repair, rebuild or replace said automobile with like kind and quality......but there shall be no abandonment to the Association of the said automobile.\u201d It seems obvious that this provision has no relation to theft of the car; it covers \u201cproperty destroyed or damaged\u201d ; the class of \u201cproperty damaged or destroyed\u201d is not enlarged to include property stolen by the use of the word \u201creplace\u201d in providing an option \u201cto repair, rebuild or replace.\u201d It doubtless related to other items of insurance specified in the policy-form.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-10\">We all agree that-.the provisions.on which plaintiff relies are controlling. They are not in conflict with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>clauses on which defendant relies, rightly understood; but if they were, those general clauses would have to give way to these specific provisions on the subject pursuant to the general rule taking doubtful provisions in insurance policies against the insurer and in favor of the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-3\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
