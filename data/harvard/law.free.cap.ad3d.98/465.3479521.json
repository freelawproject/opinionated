Cervi, Inc., 57 </em>AD3d 615 [2008]; <em>Tapia v Dattco, Inc., </em>32 AD3d 842 [2006]). When a verdict can be reconciled with a reasonable view of the evidence, the successful party is entitled to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>the presumption that the jury adopted that view (see <em>McGovern v Iqbal, </em>63 AD3d 803 [2009]; <em>Tapia v Dattco, Inc., </em>32 AD3d at 842). Here, a fair interpretation of the evidence supports the jury\u2019s conclusion that the plaintiff Patrice Algerio (hereinafter the injured plaintiff) was not entitled to damages for future pain and suffering.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\">However, considering the nature and extent of the injury to her left knee, the damages award for past pain and suffering materially deviated from what would be reasonable compensation, and is inadequate to the extent indicated (see CPLR 5501 [c]; <em>Purkiss-Riddle v New York City Tr. Auth., </em>89 AD3d 1001 [2011]; <em>Adames v Awad, </em>47 AD3d 737 [2008]; <em>Van Ness v New York City Tr. Auth., </em>288 AD2d 374 [2001]). Accordingly, there must be a new trial on the issue of damages for past pain and suffering, unless the defendants stipulate to the amount indicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">To the extent that the plaintiffs challenge the jury verdict as being inconsistent, that contention is unpreserved for appellate review since they did not advance that issue in the trial court prior to the discharge of the jury (see <em>Volino v Long Is. R.R. Co., </em>83 AD3d 693 [2011]; <em>Rivera v MTA Long Is. Bus, </em>45 AD3d 557 [2007]; <em>Miller v Long Is. R.R., 286 </em>AD2d 713 [2001]).</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">The plaintiffs\u2019 remaining contention is without merit. Florio, J.P., Balkin, Hall and Miller, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
