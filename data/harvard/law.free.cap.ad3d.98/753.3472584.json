In accordance with the plea agreement, defendant was sentenced as a second felony offender to six years in prison followed by two years of postrelease supervision, to run consecutively to the prison term he was then serving. Defendant now appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b759-9\">Appellate counsel seeks to be relieved of her assignment of representing defendant on the ground that there are no nonfrivolous issues to be raised on appeal. Based upon our review of the record, counsel\u2019s brief and defendant\u2019s pro se submission, we agree. Therefore, the judgment is affirmed and counsel\u2019s request for leave to withdraw is granted <em>(see People v Cruwys, </em>113 AD2d 979, 980 [1985], <em>lv denied </em>67 NY2d 650 [1986]; <em>see generally People v Stokes, </em>95 NY2d 633 [2001]).</p>\n<p id=\"b759-10\">Peters, P.J., Mercure, Malone Jr., Kavanagh and Stein, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed, and application to be relieved of assignment granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
