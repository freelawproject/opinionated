Accordingly, while the Court of Appeals erred by exclud<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"142\">*142</page-number>ing sales from the definition of \u201cmedical use,\u201d we affirm on alternative grounds its conclusion that the MMMA does not contemplate patient-to-patient sales of marijuana for medical use and that, by facilitating such sales, defendants\u2019 business constituted a public nuisance.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b400-6\">Defendants Brandon McQueen and Matthew Taylor own and operate C.A., LLC (hereinafter CA), formerly known as Compassionate Apothecary, LLC, a members-only medical marijuana dispensary located in Isabella County. McQueen is both a registered qualifying patient and a registered primary caregiver within the meaning of the MMMA,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> while Taylor is a registered primary caregiver. Their stated purpose in operating CA is to \u201cassist in the administration of [a] member patient\u2019s medical use\u201d of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">CA requires every member to be either a registered qualifying patient or registered primary caregiver pursuant to \u00a7 6 of the MMMA and to possess a valid, unexpired medical marijuana registry identification card from the Michigan Department of Community Health (MDCH).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> CA\u2019s basic membership fee of $5 a month allows a member to access CA\u2019s services. For an additional fee, a member can rent one or more lockers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"143\">*143</page-number>to store up to 2.5 ounces of marijuana and make that marijuana available to other CA members to purchase.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The member sets the sale price of his marijuana,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> and defendants retain a percentage of that price (about 20 percent) as a service fee. Defendants and their employees retain access at all times to the rented lockers, although the member may remove his marijuana from the lockers during business hours if he no longer wishes to make it available for sale.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">All CA members may purchase marijuana from other members\u2019 lockers.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> A member who wishes to purchase marijuana for himself (or, if the member is a registered primary caregiver, for his patient) must show his unexpired MDCH qualifying patient or primary caregiver registry identification card when entering CA. A representative of CA \u2014 either one of the individual defendants or an employee \u2014 will then take the member to the display room, where a variety of strains are available for purchase.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> The member makes a selection, and the CA representative measures and weighs the marijuana, packages it, seals it, and records the transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-6\">CA opened for business in May 2010. In July 2010, the Isabella County Prosecuting Attorney, on behalf of the state of Michigan, filed a complaint in the Isabella <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"144\">*144</page-number>Circuit Court, alleging that defendants\u2019 business constitutes a public nuisance because it does not comply with the MMMA. The complaint sought a temporary restraining order, a preliminary injunction, and a permanent injunction. After holding a two-day evidentiary hearing, the circuit court denied plaintiffs request for a preliminary injunction. The court found that defendants \u201cproperly acquired registry identification cards,\u201d that they \u201callow only registered qualifying patients and registered primary caregivers to lease lockers,\u201d and that the patients or caregivers possess permissible amounts of marijuana in their lockers. Moreover, the court found that defendants themselves \u201cdo not possess amounts of marihuana prohibited by the MMMA.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">The court further determined that \u201cthe registered qualifying patients and registered caregivers perform medical use of the marihuana by transferring the marihuana within the lockers to other registered qualifying patients and registered primary caregivers.\u201d The court noted that plaintiff had \u201cfailed to provide any evidence that defendants\u2019 medical marihuana related conduct was not for the purpose of alleviating any qualifying patient\u2019s debilitating medical condition or symptoms associated with the debilitating medical condition.\u201d As a result, \u201cthe patient-to-patient transfers and deliveries of marihuana between registered qualifying patients fall soundly within medical use of marihuana as defined by the MMMA.\u201d The court then determined that \u00a7 4 of the MMMA expressed the intent \u201cto permit. .. patient-to-patient transfers and deliveries of marihuana between registered qualifying patients in order for registered qualifying patients to acquire permissible medical marihuana to alleviate their debilitating medical conditions and their respective symptoms.\u201d Finally, it noted that \u201c [essentially, defendants <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"145\">*145</page-number>assist with the administration and usage of medical marihuana, which the Legislature permits under the MMMA.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b403-5\">The Court of Appeals reversed the circuit court\u2019s decision and remanded for entry of judgment in favor of plaintiff.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> The Court concluded that two of the circuit court\u2019s findings of fact were clearly erroneous. First, it concluded that possession of marijuana is not contingent on having an ownership interest in the marijuana and that, because \u201cdefendants exercise dominion and control over the marijuana that is stored in the lockers,\u201d they \u201cpossess the marijuana that is stored in the lockers.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Second, the Court concluded that defendants were engaged in the selling of marijuana because defendants (or their employees) \u201cintend for, make possible, and actively engage in the sale of marijuana between CA members,\u201d even though they do not themselves own the marijuana that they sell.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b403-6\">The Court concluded that the MMMA does not allow patient-to-patient sales. After noting that the MMMA \u201chas no provision governing the dispensing of marijuana,\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> the Court explained that the definition of \u201cmedical use\u201d does not encompass the sale of marijuana, because it only allows the \u201cdelivery\u201d and \u201ctransfer\u201d of marijuana, not its sale, which \u201cconsists of the delivery or transfer <em>plus </em>the receipt of compensation.\u201d<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> In reaching this conclusion, the Court reasoned that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"146\">*146</page-number>\u00a7 4(e), which allows a caregiver to receive compensation but mandates that \u201c[a]ny such compensation shall not constitute the sale of controlled substances,\u201d<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> would be unnecessary if the definition of \u201cmedical use\u201d encompassed sales.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> Finally, the Court noted that defendants are not entitled to immunity under \u00a7 4(i) of the MMMA, which insulates from liability someone who assists a registered qualifying patient \u201cwith using or administering marihuana.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> It explained that \u201c[t]here is no evidence that defendants assist patients in preparing the marijuana to be consumed\u201d or that they \u201cphysically aid the purchasing patients in consuming marijuana.\u201d<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> As a result, it concluded that plaintiff was entitled to a preliminary injunction, and it reversed the circuit court\u2019s ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b404-5\">This Court granted defendants\u2019 application for leave to appeal and requested that the parties brief \u201cwhether the Michigan Medical Marihuana Act (MMMA), MCL 333.26421 <em>et seq., </em>permits patient-to-patient sales of marijuana.\u201d<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b404-6\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b404-7\">We review for an abuse of discretion the decision to deny a preliminary injunction,<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> but we review de novo questions regarding the interpretation of the MMMA,<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> which the people enacted by initiative petition in No<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>vember 2008.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> \u201c[T]he intent of the electors governs\u201d the interpretation of voter-initiated statutes,<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> just as the intent of the Legislature governs the interpretation of legislatively enacted statutes.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> The first step in interpreting a statute is to examine the statute\u2019s plain language, which provides \u201c \u2018the most reliable evidence of... intent ....\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> \u201cIf the statutory language is unambiguous, ... \u2018[n]o further judicial construction is required or permitted\u2019 \u201d because we must conclude that the electors \u201c \u2018intended the meaning clearly expressed.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-5\">A trial court\u2019s findings of fact may not be set aside unless they are clearly erroneous.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> A ruling is clearly erroneous \u201cif the reviewing court is left with a definite and firm conviction that the trial court made a mistake.\u201d<footnotemark>32</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b405-6\">III. ANALYSIS AND APPLICATION</p>\n<p id=\"b405-7\">In this nuisance action, we must examine whether the MMMA allows the patient-to-patient sales that defendants facilitate or, instead, whether plaintiff is entitled to an injunction pursuant to MCL 600.3801.</p>\n<p id=\"b405-8\">At the time this action was brought, MCL 600.3801 stated that \u201c[a]ny building. . . used for the <em>unlawful </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>manufacture, transporting, sale, keeping for sale, bartering, or furnishing of any controlled substance as defined in [MCL 333.7104] ... is declared a nuisance . .. .\u201d<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> Marijuana is a controlled substance as defined in MCL 333.7104. However, because \u201c[t]he medical use of marihuana is allowed under state law to the extent that it is carried out in accordance with [the MMMA],\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> the MMMA controls whether defendants\u2019 business constitutes a public nuisance.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-6\">This Court first interpreted the MMMA in <em>People v Kolanek </em>and explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b406-7\">The MMMA does <em>not </em>create a general right for individuals to use and possess marijuana in Michigan. Possession, manufacture, and delivery of marijuana remain punishable offenses under Michigan law. Rather, the MMMA\u2019s protections are limited to individuals suffering from serious or debilitating medical conditions or symptoms, to the extent that the individuals\u2019 marijuana use \u201cis carried out in accordance with the provisions of [the MMMA].\u201d[<footnotemark>35</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b406-8\">In contrast to several other states\u2019 medical marijuana provisions,<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> the MMMA does not explicitly provide for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>businesses that dispense marijuana to patients. Nevertheless, defendants claim that \u00a7 3(e) of the MMMA allows their business to facilitate patient-to-patient sales of marijuana. The Court of Appeals disagreed and held that the term \u201cmedical use,\u201d defined in \u00a7 3(e), does not encompass sales. We turn now to this provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">A. \u201cMEDICAL USE\u201d OF MAKIJUANA</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">As stated, \u00a7 7(a) of the MMMA provides that \u201c[t]he medical use of marihuana is allowed under state law to the extent that it is carried out in accordance with the provisions of [the MMMA].\u201d The MMMA specifically defines \u201cmedical use\u201d in \u00a7 3(e) as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b407-7\">the acquisition, possession, cultivation, manufacture, use, internal possession, delivery, transfer, or transportation of marihuana or paraphernalia relating to the administration of marihuana to treat or alleviate a registered qualifying patient\u2019s debilitating medical condition or symptoms associated with the debilitating medical condition.[<footnotemark>37</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">At issue in this case is whether the sale of marijuana is an activity that falls within this definition of \u201cmedical use.\u201d The definition specifically incorporates nine activities relating to marijuana as \u201cmedical use,\u201d but it does not expressly use the word \u201csale.\u201d Because of this omission, plaintiff argues, and the Court of Appeals held, that the sale of marijuana falls outside the statutory definition of \u201cmedical use\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b408-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>[T]he sale of marijuana is <em>not </em>equivalent <em>to the </em>delivery or transfer of marijuana. The delivery or transfer of marijuana is only one component of the sale of marijuana \u2014 the sale of marijuana consists of the delivery or transfer <em>plus </em>the receipt of compensation. The \u201cmedical use\u201d of marijuana, as defined by the MMMA, allows for the \u201cdelivery\u201d and \u201ctransfer\u201d of marijuana, but not the \u201csale\u201d of marijuana. MCL 333.26423(e). We may not ignore, or view as inadvertent, the omission of the term \u201csale\u201d from the definition of the \u201cmedical use\u201d of marijuana.[<footnotemark>38</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Defendants claim that the Court of Appeals erred by excluding sales from the definition of \u201cmedical use.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">In determining whether a sale constitutes \u201cmedical use,\u201d we first look to how the MMMA defines the term \u201cmedical use.\u201d In particular, the definition of \u201cmedical use\u201d contains the word \u201ctransfer\u201d as one of nine activities encompassing \u201cmedical use.\u201d The MMMA, however, does not itself define \u201ctransfer\u201d or any of the other eight activities encompassing \u201cmedical use.\u201d Because undefined terms \u201cshall be construed and understood according to the common and approved usage of the language,\u201d<footnotemark>39</footnotemark> it is appropriate to consult dictionary definitions of terms used in the MMMA.<footnotemark>40</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b408-8\">A transfer is <em>\u201c[a]ny </em>mode of disposing of or parting with an asset or an interest in an asset, including a gift, <em>the payment of money, </em>release, lease, or creation of a lien or other encumbrance.\u201d<footnotemark>41</footnotemark> Similarly, a sale is \u201c[t]he <em>transfer </em>of property or title for a price.\u201d<footnotemark>42</footnotemark> Given these <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>definitions, to state that a transfer does not encompass a sale is to ignore what a transfer encompasses. That a sale has an <em>additional </em>characteristic, distinguishing it from other types of transfers, does not make it any less a transfer, nor does that additional characteristic require that the definition of \u201cmedical use\u201d separately delineate the term \u201csale\u201d in order for a sale to be considered a medical use.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Nor do other provisions of the MMMA limit the definition of \u201cmedical use\u201d to exclude sales. For instance, \u00a7 4(e) allows a registered primary caregiver to \u201creceive compensation for costs associated with assisting a registered qualifying patient in the medical use of marihuana,\u201d but states that \u201c[a]ny such compensation shall not constitute the sale of controlled substances.\u201d<footnotemark>43</footnotemark> While this section specifically contemplates that a registered qualifying patient may compensate his caregiver, it does not narrow the word \u201ctransfer\u201d as used in the \u00a7 3(e) definition of \u201cmedical use.\u201d<footnotemark>44</footnotemark> Rather, \u00a7 4(e) independently describes the relationship between a registered caregiver and his registered qualifying patient and provides an additional protection for the patient-caregiver relationship by emphasizing that it is not a criminal act for a registered qualifying patient to compensate a registered primary caregiver for costs associated with providing marijuana to the patient.<footnotemark>45</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">Additionally, \u00a7 4(k) establishes criminal sanctions for a patient or caregiver \u201cwho sells marihuana to someone who is not allowed to use marihuana for medical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>purposes under [the MMMA] . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>46</footnotemark> This provision is also irrelevant to understanding the definition of \u201cmedical use\u201d in \u00a7 3(e). <em>Any </em>transfer to a person who is \u201cnot allowed to use marihuana for medical purposes\u201d<footnotemark>47</footnotemark> \u2014 whether for a price or not \u2014 is already specifically excluded from the definition of \u201cmedical use,\u201d which requires a medical use to have the specific purpose to \u201ctreat or alleviate a <em>registered qualifying patient\u2019s </em>debilitating medical condition or symptoms associated with the debilitating medical condition.\u201d<footnotemark>48</footnotemark> Thus, rather than inform the definition of \u201cmedical use,\u201d \u00a7 4(k)<footnotemark>49</footnotemark> simply provides an additional criminal penalty for certain actions that <em>already </em>fall outside the definition of \u201cmedical use\u201d and that are already barred under the Public Health Code.<footnotemark>50</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Therefore, we hold that the definition of \u201cmedical use\u201d in \u00a7 3(e) of the MMMA includes the sale of marijuana. The Court of Appeals erred by concluding otherwise, and we reverse that portion of the Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment defining \u201cmedical use.\u201d Nevertheless, this definition of \u201cmedical use\u201d only forms the beginning of our inquiry. Section 7(a) of the act requires <em>any </em>medical use of marijuana to occur \u201cin accordance with the provisions of [the MMMA].\u201d That limitation requires this Court to look beyond the definition of \u201cmedical use\u201d to determine whether defendants\u2019 business operates \u201cin accordance with the provisions of [the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>MMMA].\u201d<footnotemark>51</footnotemark> Absent a situation triggering the affirmative defense of \u00a7 8 of the MMMA,<footnotemark>52</footnotemark> \u00a7 4 sets forth the requirements for a person to be entitled to immunity for the \u201cmedical use\u201d of marijuana. It is entitlement to that immunity \u2014 not the definition of \u201cmedical use\u201d\u2014 that demonstrates that the person\u2019s medical use of marijuana is in accordance with the MMMA. Therefore, we turn to \u00a7 4 to determine whether patient-to-patient sales are entitled to that section\u2019s provision of immunity.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">B. SECTION 4 IMMUNITY</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Section 4(a) of the MMMA grants a \u201cqualifying patient who has been issued and possesses a registry identification card\u201d<footnotemark>53</footnotemark> immunity from arrest, prosecution, or penalty \u201cfor the medical use of marihuana in accordance with this act. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>54</footnotemark> Similarly, \u00a7 4(b) grants the same immunity from arrest, prosecution, or penalty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>to \u201c[a] primary caregiver who has been issued and possesses a registry identification card . . . for assisting a qualifying patient to whom he or she is connected through the [MDCH\u2019s] registration process with the medical use of marihuana in accordance with this act____\u201d<footnotemark>55</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">Furthermore, \u00a7 4(d) creates a presumption of medical use, which informs how \u00a7 4 immunity can be asserted or negated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-7\">There shall be a presumption that a qualifying patient or primary caregiver is engaged in the medical use of marihuana in accordance with this act if the qualifying patient or primary caregiver:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-8\">(1) is in possession of a registry identification card; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-9\">(2) is in possession of an amount of marihuana that does not exceed the amount allowed under this act. <em>The presumption may be rebutted </em>by evidence that conduct related to marihuana <em>was not for the purpose of alleviating </em>the qualifying patient\u2019s debilitating medical condition or symptoms associated with the debilitating medical condition, in accordance with this act.[<footnotemark>56</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-10\">Because \u00a7 4(d) creates a presumption of medical use and then states how that presumption may be rebutted, we conclude that a rebutted presumption of medical use renders immunity under \u00a7 4 of the MMMA inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>The text of \u00a7 4(d) establishes that the MMMA intends to allow \u201ca qualifying patient or primary caregiver\u201d to be immune from arrest, prosecution, or penalty <em>only </em>if conduct related to marijuana is \u201cfor the purpose of alleviating <em>the </em>qualifying patient\u2019s debilitating medical condition\u201d or its symptoms. Section 4 creates a <em>personal </em>right and protection for a registered qualifying patient\u2019s medical use of marijuana, but that right is limited to medical use that has the purpose of alleviating that patient\u2019s <em>own </em>debilitating medical condition or symptoms. If the medical use of marijuana is for some <em>other </em>purpose \u2014 -even to alleviate the medical condition or symptoms of <em>a different registered qualifying patient </em>\u2014 then the presumption of immunity attendant to the \u201cmedical use\u201d of marijuana has been rebutted.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">The dissent claims that the presumption of immunity attendant to the \u201cmedical use\u201d of marijuana applies when a qualifying patient transfers marijuana to another qualifying patient. However, the dissent\u2019s construction is not consistent with the statutory language that the people of Michigan actually adopted.<footnotemark>57</footnotemark> The presumption that \u201ca qualifying patient\u201d is engaged in the medical use of marijuana under \u00a7 4(d) is rebutted when marijuana-related conduct is \u201cnot for the purpose of alleviating <em>the </em>qualifying patient\u2019s debilitating medical condition . . . .\u201d Contrary to the dissent\u2019s conclusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>that \u00a7 4(d) only requires \u201cone of the two qualified patients involved in the transfer of marijuana [to] have a debilitating medical condition that the transfer of marijuana purports to alleviate,\u201d<footnotemark>58</footnotemark> the definite article in \u00a7 4(d) refers to the qualifying patient who is asserting \u00a7 4 immunity, not to <em>any </em>qualifying patient involved in a transaction. While the introductory language of \u00a7 4(d) refers to \u201ca\u201d qualifying patient, that indefinite article simply means that any qualifying patient may claim \u00a7 4(d) immunity, as long as the marijuana-related conduct is related to alleviating \u201cthe\u201d patient\u2019s medical condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">Thus, \u00a7 4 immunity does not extend to a registered qualifying patient who transfers marijuana to another registered qualifying patient for the transferee\u2019s use<footnotemark>59</footnotemark> because the transferor is not engaging in conduct related to marijuana for the purpose of relieving <em>the transferor\u2019s own </em>condition or symptoms.<footnotemark>60</footnotemark> Similarly, \u00a7 4 immunity does not extend to a registered primary caregiver who transfers marijuana for any purpose other than to alleviate the condition or symptoms of a specific patient <em>with whom the caregiver is connected through the MDCH\u2019s registration process.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b415-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>Defendants\u2019 business facilitates patient-to-patient sales, presumably to benefit the transferee patient\u2019s debilitating medical condition or symptoms. However, those transfers do not qualify for \u00a7 4 immunity because they encompass marijuana-related conduct that is not for the purpose of alleviating the <em>transferor\u2019s </em>debilitating medical condition or its symptoms. Because the defendants\u2019 \u201cmedical use\u201d of marijuana does not comply with the immunity provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 4(a), 4(b), and 4(d), defendants cannot claim that \u00a7 4 insulates them from a public nuisance claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Nevertheless, defendants posit that, even if they are not entitled to immunity under \u00a7 4(d), \u00a7 4(i) permits their business to operate in accordance with the MMMA. Section 4(i) insulates a person from \u201carrest, prosecution, or penalty in any manner. . . solely for being in the presence or vicinity of the medical use of marihuana in accordance with this act, or for assisting a registered qualifying patient with using or administering marihuana.\u201d<footnotemark>61</footnotemark> However, this provision does not apply to defendants\u2019 actions, nor does it apply to any patient-to-patient transfers of marijuana. First, defendants were not \u201csolely ... in the presence or vicinity of the medical use of marihuana\u201d because they were actively facilitating patient-to-patient sales for pecuniary gain. Second, defendants were not \u201cassisting a registered qualifying patient with using or administering marihuana.\u201d While they were assisting one registered qualifying patient with <em>acquiring </em>marijuana and another registered qualifying patient with <em>transferring </em>marijuana, they were not assisting <em>anyone </em>with <em>using </em>or <em>administering </em>marijuana.<footnotemark>62</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>Notably, \u00a7 4(i) does not contain the statutory term \u201cmedical use,\u201d but instead contains two of the nine activities that encompass medical use: \u201cusing\u201d and \u201cadministering\u201d marijuana. \u201cUse\u201d is defined as \u201cto employ for some purpose; put into service[.]\u201d<footnotemark>63</footnotemark> \u201cAdminister\u201d is defined in the medicinal context as \u201cto give or apply: <em>to administer </em>medicine.\u201d<footnotemark>64</footnotemark> In this context, the terms \u201cusing\u201d and \u201cadministering\u201d are limited to conduct involving the actual ingestion of marijuana. Thus, by its plain language, \u00a7 4(i) permits, for example, the spouse of a registered qualifying patient to assist the patient in ingesting marijuana, regardless of the spouse\u2019s status. However, \u00a7 4(i) does not permit defendants\u2019 conduct in this case. Defendants transferred and delivered marijuana to patients by facilitating patient-to-patient sales; in doing so, they assisted those patients in acquiring marijuana. The transfer, delivery, and acquisition of marijuana are three activities that are part of the \u201cmedical use\u201d of marijuana that the drafters of the MMMA chose <em>not </em>to include as protected activities within \u00a7 4(i). As a result, defendants\u2019 actions were not in accordance with the MMMA under that provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">C. SECTION 8 AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">Finally, even though \u00a7 4 does not permit defendants to operate a business that facilitates patient-to-patient sales of marijuana, our decision in <em>Kolanek </em>makes clear that \u00a7 8 provides separate protections for medical marijuana patients and caregivers and that one need not satisfy the requirements of \u00a7 4 immunity to be entitled to the \u00a7 8 affirmative defense,<footnotemark>65</footnotemark> which allows \u201ca patient and a patient\u2019s primary caregiver, if any, [to] assert the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>medical purpose for using marihuana as a defense to any prosecution involving marihuana____\u201d<footnotemark>66</footnotemark> However, by its own terms, \u00a7 8(a) only applies \u201cas a defense to any <em>prosecution </em>involving marihuana____\u201d<footnotemark>67</footnotemark> The text and structure of \u00a7 8 establish that the drafters and voters intended that \u201cprosecution\u201d refer only to a criminal proceeding. Specifically, \u00a7 8(b) explains that a person \u201cmay assert the medical purpose for using marihuana in a <em>motion to dismiss, </em>and the <em>charges </em>shall be dismissed following an evidentiary hearing where the person shows the elements listed in subsection (a).\u201d<footnotemark>68</footnotemark> As a result, \u00a7 8 does not provide defendants with a basis to assert that their actions are in accordance with the MMMA.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\">Although it did so for a different reason than the one we articulate, the Court of Appeals reached the correct conclusion that defendants are not entitled to operate a business that facilitates patient-to-patient sales of marijuana. Because the business model of defendants\u2019 dispensary relies entirely on transactions that do not comply with the MMMA, defendants are operating their business in \u201c[a] building .. . used for the unlawful.. . keeping for sale ... or furnishing of any controlled substance,\u201d and plaintiff is entitled to an injunction enjoining the continuing operation of the business because it is a public nuisance.<footnotemark>69</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b418-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b418-4\">Because we conclude that defendants\u2019 business does not comply with the MMMA, we affirm the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision on alternative grounds. While the sale of marijuana constitutes \u201cmedical use\u201d as the term is defined in MCL 333.26423(c), \u00a7 4 of the MMMA, MCL 333.26424, does not permit a registered qualifying patient to transfer marijuana for another registered qualifying patient\u2019s medical use.

In this sense, \u00a7 4 immunity is asymmetric: it allows a registered qualifying patient to obtain marijuana for his own medical use but does not allow him to transfer marijuana for another registered qualifying patient\u2019s use.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"61\">\n<p id=\"b415-6\"> MCL 333.26424G).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"62\">\n<p id=\"b415-7\"> Defendants specifically denied that they allowed any ingestion of marijuana to occur at CA.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"63\">\n<p id=\"b416-7\"> <em>Random House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary </em>(2d ed, 1997), p 1414.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"64\">\n<p id=\"b416-8\"> <em>Id. </em>at 17.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"65\">\n<p id=\"b416-9\"> <em>Kolanek, </em>491 Mich at 403.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"66\">\n<p id=\"b417-10\"> MCL 333.26428(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"67\">\n<p id=\"b417-11\"> <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"68\">\n<p id=\"b417-12\"> MCL 333.26428(b) (emphasis added).

I respectfully disagree with the majority\u2019s interpretation of the Michigan Medical Marihuana Act (MMMA), MCL 333.26421 <em>et seq. </em>In my view, \u00a7 4(d)(2) of the act, MCL 333.26424(d)(2), does not limit, the definition of \u201cmedical use\u201d of marijuana set forth in \u00a7 3(e) of the act, MCL 333.26423(e), so that a qualified patient who transfers marijuana to another qualified patient is precluded from asserting immunity under \u00a7 4(a) of the act, MCL 333.26424(a). Rather, I would hold that when a qualified patient transfers marijuana to another qualified patient, both individuals <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>have the right to assert immunity under \u00a7 4 of the act, MCL 333.26424. Furthermore, as a result of the majority\u2019s erroneous interpretation of \u00a7 4, the majority improperly concludes that any facilitation of the transfer of marijuana from patient to patient is unlawful and enjoinable as a nuisance.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">As the majority explains, defendants\u2019 activity falls under the definition of \u201cmedical use\u201d of marijuana set forth in \u00a7 3(e) of the act, which states that \u201cmedical use\u201d means \u201cthe acquisition, possession, cultivation, manufacture, use, internal possession, delivery, <em>transfer, </em>or transportation of marihuana... to treat or alleviate a registered qualifying patient\u2019s debilitating medical condition . . . .\u201d MCL 333.26423(e) (emphasis added). However, the majority erroneously concludes that <em>only </em>the qualified patient who receives marijuana is entitled to assert \u00a7 4 immunity in light of its interpretation of \u00a7 4(d)(2). Section 4(d) of the act provides a presumption that \u201ca qualifying patient or primary caregiver is engaged in the medical use of marihuana\u201d when certain conditions are met. MCL 333.26424(d). However, under \u00a7 4(d)(2), that presumption may be rebutted with evidence that the \u201cconduct related to marihuana was not for the purpose of alleviating <em>the </em>qualifying patient\u2019s debilitating medical condition . . . .\u201d MCL 333.26424(d)(2) (emphasis added). The majority reasons that the reference to \u201cthe\u201d qualified patient requires the conclusion that only the recipient of marijuana is entitled to \u00a7 4 immunity for a patient-to-patient transfer of marijuana because only the transferee\u2019s medical condition may be alleviated as a result of the transfer.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">I disagree with this interpretation because it is inconsistent with the rules of statutory interpretation. When interpreting the MMMA, \u201c[w]e must give the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>words of the MMMA their ordinary and plain meaning as would have been understood by the electorate.\u201d <em>People v Kolanek, </em>491 Mich 382, 397; 817 NW2d 528 (2012), citing <em>People v Barbee, </em>470 Mich 283, 286; 681 NW2d 348 (2004). It is true that, in order for the \u00a7 4(d) presumption to apply, the marijuana-related conduct at issue must be for the purpose of alleviating the medical condition or symptoms of the qualified patient who in fact suffers from a debilitating medical condition. However, when a qualified patient transfers marijuana to another qualified patient, the transferor is also engaged in marijuana-related conduct for the purpose of alleviating the medical condition of the qualified patient who is also involved in the transfer and is suffering from a debilitating medical condition. The marijuana-related conduct is the transfer of marijuana, which is expressly included in the definition of \u201cmedical use\u201d of marijuana. MCL 333.26423(e). Thus, the reference in \u00a7 4(d)(2) to \u201cthe\u201d qualifying patient simply requires that one of the two qualified patients involved in the transfer of marijuana have a debilitating medical condition that the transfer of marijuana is intended to alleviate.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-4\">Moreover, when interpreting a statute, \u201c[a] court should consider the plain meaning of a statute\u2019s words and their placement and purpose in the statutory scheme.\u201d <em>McCormick v Carrier, </em>487 Mich 180, 192; 795 NW2d 517 (2010) (citation and quotation marks omitted). The majority\u2019s singular reliance on the reference in \u00a7 4(d)(2) to \u201cthe\u201d qualifying patient ignores the fact that \u00a7 4(a) and the introductory language of \u00a7 4(d) refer to \u201ca\u201d qualifying patient. Therefore, when \u00a7 4(d)(2) is viewed in the context of \u00a7 4 in its entirety, it is clear that <em>any </em>qualified patient \u201cwho has been issued and possesses a registry identification card\u201d has the right to assert \u00a7 4 immunity. MCL 333.26424(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>The majority characterizes its holding as creating \u201casymmetric\u201d immunity under \u00a7 4 because it permits a qualified patient who receives marijuana to assert immunity, but a qualified patient who transfers marijuana is not entitled to the same protection. <em>Ante </em>at 156 n 60. Thus, under the majority\u2019s holding, a qualified patient\u2019s right to receive marijuana is effectively extinguished because a patient-to-patient transfer of marijuana can never occur lawfully for both qualifying patients. I cannot conclude from the plain meaning of the language of the MMMA that the electorate intended to afford a person a right only to foreclose any real possibility that the person may benefit from that right. Furthermore, the majority\u2019s view is inconsistent with the purpose of the MMMA \u2014 to promote the \u201chealth and welfare of [Michigan] citizens\u201d \u2014 because qualified patients who- are in need of marijuana for medical use, yet do not have the ability to either cultivate marijuana or find a trustworthy primary caregiver, are, for all practical purposes, deprived of an additional route to obtain marijuana for that use \u2014 another qualified patient\u2019s transfer. MCL 333.26422(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-4\">Lastly, the majority\u2019s erroneous interpretation of \u00a7 4(d) leads the majority to an inadequate analysis regarding its ultimate conclusion that defendants\u2019 facilitation of the transfer of marijuana is enjoinable under MCL 600.3801 and MCL 600.3805 as a public nuisance.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because I would conclude that the MMMA does not exclude patient-to-patient transfers of marijuana from the immunity afforded under \u00a7 4 of the act, the next inquiry should be whether the <em>facilitation </em>of the transfer of marijuana falls under the act\u2019s definition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>of \u201cmedical use\u201d of marijuana, which, if so, means that a qualified patient who facilitates the transfer of marijuana has the right to assert immunity under \u00a7 4(a) and is entitled to the presumption that he or she was engaged in the medical use of marijuana under \u00a7 4(d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The majority skims over this question by employing the same flawed reasoning that it uses to conclude that the MMMA does not permit patient-to-patient transfers of marijuana \u2014 that the transfers of marijuana that defendants facilitated are only subject to immunity to the extent that the recipient of the marijuana may assert the immunity. Thus, not only has the majority improperly limited a qualified patient\u2019s right to receive marijuana for medical use from another qualified patient, as previously explained, but the majority also holds that virtually all medical-marijuana dispensaries are illegal and thus enjoinable as a nuisance because those operations facilitate patient-to-patient transfers of marijuana.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-4\">In sum, I respectfully disagree with the majority\u2019s interpretation of \u00a7 4(d)(2), which limits the definition of \u201cmedical use\u201d of marijuana as set forth in \u00a7 3(e) because that interpretation erroneously precludes a qualified patient who transfers marijuana to another qualified patient from asserting \u00a7 4 immunity. Rather, I would hold that both qualified patients involved in a patient-to-patient transfer of marijuana have the right to assert <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>immunity and are entitled to immunity if they meet the specific requirements of \u00a7 4. Thus, I also disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that any facilitation of a patient-to-patient transfer of marijuana is enjoinable as a nuisance.</p>\n<judges id=\"b424-4\">MCCORMACK, J., took no part in the decision of this case.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b422-5\"> MCL 600.3801(1)(c) states that a building may be declared a nuisance if \u201c[i]t is used for the unlawful manufacture, transporting, sale, keeping for sale, bartering, or furnishing of a controlled substance.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b423-5\"> Notably, the same analysis is not equally applicable to primary caregivers because while \u00a7 4(b) allows primary caregivers to assert immunity for the medical use of marijuana, that immunity is conditioned by the fact that the caregiver must be \u201cassisting a qualifying patient to whom he or she is connected through the department\u2019s registration process .. . .\u201d MCL 333.26424(b). Similarly, a qualified patient\u2019s right to assert \u00a7 4 immunity is conditioned on additional requirements apart from the requirement that he or she was engaging in the medical use of marijuana.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
