(Chase), the successor in interest to Washington Mutual Bank (WaMu), acquired plaintiffs\u2019 mortgage. Plaintiffs\u2019 mortgage was among the assets held by WaMu when it collapsed in 2008 in the largest bank failure in American history.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Specifically, we must determine whether defendant acquired plaintiffs\u2019 mortgage by \u201coperation of law\u201d and, if so, whether MCL 600.3204(3), which sets forth requirements for foreclosing by advertisement, applies to the acquisition of a mortgage by operation of law. We asked the parties to address whether, if the foreclosure proceedings that defendant initiated were flawed, the subsequent foreclosure is void <em>ab initio </em>or merely voidable.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b360-7\">We hold that defendant did not acquire plaintiffs\u2019 mortgage by operation of law. Rather, defendant acquired that mortgage through a voluntary purchase agreement. Accordingly, defendant was required to comply with the provisions of MCL 600.3204. We further hold, differently than did the Court of Appeals, that the foreclosure sale in this case was voidable rather than void <em>ab initio. </em>Accordingly, we affirm in part and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>reverse in part the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case to the trial court for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">I. factual background and procedural history</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">On July 11, 2007, plaintiffs obtained a loan from WaMu in the amount of $615,000 to refinance their residence. As security for the loan, plaintiffs granted a mortgage on the property to WaMu, which properly recorded it later that month.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">When WaMu collapsed on September 25, 2008, the federal Office of Thrift Management closed the bank and appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) as receiver for its holdings. That same day, the FDIC, acting as WaMu\u2019s receiver, transferred virtually all of WaMu\u2019s assets to defendant under authority set forth in the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Under 12 USC 1821, the FDIC is empowered to transfer the assets of a failed bank \u201cwithout any approval, assignment, or consent . . . .\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> However, in this case, it did not avail itself of that authority. Instead, the FDIC sold WaMu\u2019s assets to defendant pursuant to a purchase and assumption (P&amp;A) agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">Plaintiffs sought a loan modification in 2009 because they were having difficulty making their mortgage payments. They assert that a WaMu representative advised them that they were ineligible for a loan modification because they were not at least three months in arrears on their payments. Plaintiffs claim that on the basis of this information, they deliberately allowed their mortgage to become delinquent to qualify for a loan <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>modification. They further allege that they signed documents to complete the modification and that their attorney assured them that their loan modification had been approved.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">Defendant notified plaintiffs in May 2009 that it was foreclosing on their property. Plaintiffs contend that they attempted to ascertain whether the foreclosure notice had been sent in error in light of the purported loan modification and were advised by a WaMu representative \u201cnot to worry.\u201d Defendant published the required notice of foreclosure in May and June 2009. The property was sold to defendant at a sheriffs sale on June 26, 2009.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">Plaintiffs filed suit on November 30, 2009, seeking to set aside the sale on the ground that they had received a loan modification and that defendant had not bid fair market value for the property at the sale. Defendant responded with a motion for summary disposition. The trial court granted summary disposition to defendant. It ruled that defendant had acquired plaintiffs\u2019 mortgage by operation of law. As a consequence, MCL 600.3204(3), which requires that a mortgage assignment be recorded before initiation of a foreclosure by advertisement, was inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">Plaintiffs appealed, pursuing only their claim that defendant had failed to comply with MCL 600.3204(3) and that, as a result, the foreclosure sale was void <em>ab initio. </em>The Court of Appeals agreed. It held that MCL 600.3204(3) applied to defendant because defendant was not the original mortgagee and acquired the loan by assignment rather than by operation of law.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> It reasoned that the FDIC, as receiver of WaMu\u2019s assets, had acquired those assets by operation of law, but not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>defendant, which had purchased them from the FDIC.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Hence, the Court of Appeals held that defendant had a statutory obligation to record the assignment of plaintiffs\u2019 mortgage to it before foreclosing by advertisement.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Moreover, the Court of Appeals held that defendant\u2019s failure to record the assignment rendered the sheriffs sale void <em>ab </em>initio.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Accordingly, it remanded the case to the trial court for entry of judgment in favor of plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-3\">Defendant filed an application for leave to appeal in this Court. We granted its application.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"aas-dedup-0\">A. LEGAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">We review de novo the grant or denial of a motion for summary disposition.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> We use the same standard to review questions of statutory interpretation.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">At the heart of this dispute are the statutory provisions governing the foreclosure of mortgages by advertisement.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> MCL 600.3204 sets forth the requirements, providing in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b363-7\">(1) Subject to subsection (4) [providing certain exceptions inapplicable to this case], a party may foreclose a mortgage by advertisement if all of the following circumstances exist:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>(a) A default in a condition of the mortgage has occurred, by which the power to sell became operative.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-6\">(b) An action or proceeding has not been instituted, at law, to recover the debt secured by the mortgage or any part of the mortgage; or, if an action or proceeding has been instituted, the action or proceeding has been discontinued; or an execution on a judgment rendered in an action or proceeding has been returned unsatisfied, in whole or in part.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-7\">(c) The mortgage containing the power of sale has been properly recorded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-8\">(d) The party foreclosing the mortgage is either the owner of the indebtedness or of an interest in the indebtedness secured by the mortgage or the servicing agent of the mortgage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b364-9\">(3) If the party foreclosing a mortgage by advertisement is not the original mortgagee, a record chain of title shall exist prior to the date of sale under [MCL 600.3216] evidencing the assignment of the mortgage to the party foreclosing the mortgage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b364-10\">Thus, as a general matter, a mortgagee cannot validly foreclose a mortgage by advertisement before the mortgage and all assignments of that mortgage are duly recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-11\">This common understanding of the requirement of recordation before foreclosure by advertisement was also set forth in a 2004 Attorney General opinion. Our Attorney General stated that \u201ca mortgagee cannot validly foreclose a mortgage by advertisement unless the mortgage and all assignments of that mortgage (except those assignments effected by operation of law) are entitled to be, and have been, recorded.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In 2004, the operative language now set forth in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>MCL 600.3204(3) was found in MCL 600.3204(1)(c).<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">The general powers of the FDIC in its capacity as conservator or receiver<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> that are germane to this case are set forth in 12 USC 1821. Specifically, 12 USC 1821(d)(2) describes the manner in which the FDIC acquires assets. It provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-6\">(A) Successor to institution. \u2014 The [FDIC] shall, as conservator or receiver, and <em>by operation of law, </em>succeed to\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-7\">(i) all rights, titles, powers, and privileges of the insured depository institution, and of any stockholder, member, accountholder, depositor, officer, or director of such institution with respect to the institution and the assets of the institution; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-8\">(ii) title to the books, records, and assets of any previous conservator or other legal custodian of such institution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-9\">Subsection (d)(2) also sets forth the FDIC\u2019s authority to dispose of a failed bank\u2019s assets, providing in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>(G) Merger; transfer of assets and liabilities. \u2014 \u2022</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-4\">(i) In general. \u2014 The [FDIC] may, as conservator or receiver\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-5\">(I) merge the insured depository institution with another insured depository institution; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-6\">(II) subject to clause (ii), transfer any asset or liability of the institution in default (including assets and liabilities associated with any trust business) without any approval, assignment, or consent with respect to such transfer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b366-7\">(ii) Approval by appropriate Federal banking agency.- \u2014 No transfer described in clause (i)(II) may be made to another depository institution ... without the approval of the appropriate Federal banking agency for such institution.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b366-8\">B. APPLICATION</p>\n<p id=\"b366-9\">Against this backdrop, we consider the manner in which defendant acquired plaintiffs\u2019 mortgage and whether the requirements of MCL 600.3204 apply to that acquisition.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-10\">1. DEFENDANT DID NOT ACQUIRE PLAINTIFFS\u2019 MORTGAGE BY OPERATION OF LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b366-11\">Two transfers of plaintiffs\u2019 mortgage occurred on September 25, 2008. The first, between WaMu and the FDIC, was consummated when the Office of Thrift Management closed WaMu and appointed the FDIC as its receiver. This transfer took place pursuant to 12 USC 1821 (d)(2)(A)(i) and (ii), which provide that the FDIC \u201cshall, as conservator or receiver, and <em>by operation of law, </em>succeed to . . . all rights, titles, powers, and privileges of the insured depository institution . . . and title to the books, records, and assets of any previous conservator or other legal custodian of such institution.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Thus, when the FDIC succeeded to WaMu\u2019s assets, which included plaintiffs\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>mortgage, it did so by clear operation of a statutory provision \u2014 12 USC 1821(d)(2)(A). With respect to this transfer, the FDIC acquired plaintiffs\u2019 mortgage by operation of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">But the FDIC only briefly possessed WaMu\u2019s assets, including plaintiffs\u2019 mortgage. It immediately transferred those assets to defendant. The dispositive question in this case is whether the second transfer of WaMu\u2019s assets \u2014 the transfer from the FDIC to defendant \u2014 took place by operation of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">The seminal case discussing the term \u201coperation of law\u201d in the context of foreclosures by advertisement is <em>Miller v </em>Clark.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> In <em>Miller, </em>a mortgagee died intestate. The Court considered whether the guardian of his heirs was obliged to record an assignment of the mortgage before foreclosing on it by advertisement. The Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-7\">The authority to foreclose such mortgages by advertisement is purely statutory, and all the requirements of the statute must be substantially complied with. To entitle a party to foreclose in this manner it is required, among other things, that the mortgage containing such power of sale has been duly recorded; and if it shall have been assigned, that all the assignments thereof shall have been recorded. And also that the notice shall specify the names of the mortgagor and the mortgagee, and of the assignee of the mortgage, if any.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b367-8\"><em>The assignments which are required to be recorded are those which are executed by the voluntary act of the party, and this does not apply to cases where the title is transferred by operation of law, </em>the object of the statute being to restrict the execution of the power to the owner of the legal title to the instrument/[<footnotemark>17</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b368-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>Thus, <em>Miller </em>contemplated that a transfer occurs by operation of law when it takes place involuntarily or as the result of no affirmative action on the part of the transferee.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">Miller\u2019s interpretation of when a transfer occurs by \u201coperation of law\u201d is consistent with Black\u2019s Law Dictionary\u2019s definition of the expression. Black\u2019s defines \u201coperation of law\u201d as \u201c[t]he means by which a right or a liability is created for a party <em>regardless of the party\u2019s actual intent.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>18</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Similarly, this Court has long understood the expression to indicate \u201cthe manner in which a party acquires rights <em>without any act of his own.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>19</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Accordingly, there is ample authority for the proposition that a transfer that takes place by operation of law occurs unintentionally, involuntarily, or through no affirmative act of the transferee.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">Applying this proposition, we hold that the transfer of WaMu\u2019s assets from the FDIC to defendant did not take place by operation of law. Defendant acquired WaMu\u2019s assets from the FDIC in a voluntary transaction; defendant was not forced to acquire them. Instead, defendant took the affirmative action of voluntarily paying for them. Had defendant not willingly purchased them, it would not have come into possession of plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"111\">*111</page-number>tiffs\u2019 mortgage. WaMu\u2019s assets did not pass to defendant \u201cwithout any act of [defendant\u2019s] own\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> or \u201cregardless of [defendant\u2019s] actual intent.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Accordingly, the Court of Appeals correctly concluded that defendant did not acquire WaMu\u2019s assets by operation of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-4\">Defendant and the dissent contend that the transfer occurred by operation of law because, although not a merger, the transfer was analogous to a merger and should be treated as one. We find this reasoning unpersuasive.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> 12 USC 1821 (d) (2) (G) (i) (I) empowered the FDIC to merge WaMu with another financial institution such as defendant. Had a merger occurred under that statutory provision, defendant would have a strong argument that it had merely stepped into the shoes of WaMu. It would have had no need to engage in a transfer of any of WaMu\u2019s assets. And the transaction would have occurred without any voluntary or affirmative action by defendant, given that the FDIC may, at its discretion, merge a failed bank with another institution. The transaction could have constituted a transfer by operation of law under traditional banking and corporate law.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>But here, a merger did not occur. In selling WaMu\u2019s assets to defendant, the FDIC relied on a different statutory provision, 12 USC 1821(d)(2)(G)(i)(II), which allows the FDIC to \u201ctransfer\u201d the assets and liabilities of failed institutions. Hence, although the FDIC could have effectuated a merger in reliance on subsection (d) (2) (G) (i) (I), it explicitly chose not to do so. Indeed, the FDIC submitted an affidavit to the Court that describes the transaction, specifically citing the subsection of the statute authorizing transfers, rather than the subsection authorizing mergers.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Unlike the dissent, we will not conclude that a merger took place when the FDIC so clearly chose to engage in a different type of transaction under a different statutory provision.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b370-4\">In sum, the Court of Appeals correctly held that defendant did not acquire WaMu\u2019s assets by operation of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>2. DEFENDANT\u2019S FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH MCL 600.3204(3) RENDERS THE FORECLOSURE OF PLAINTIFFS\u2019 PROPERTY VOIDABLE</p>\n<p id=\"b371-5\">As noted earlier, MCL 600.3204 sets forth several requirements for foreclosing a property by advertisement. Subsection (3) requires a party that is not the original mortgagee to record the assignment of the mortgage to it before foreclosing. Because defendant acquired plaintiffs\u2019 mortgage through a voluntary transfer, and given that it was not the original mortgagee, it was subject to the recordation requirement of MCL 600.3204(3). Having made that determination, we must now decide the effect of defendant\u2019s failure to comply with that provision.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">With meager supporting analysis, the Court of Appeals concluded that defendant\u2019s failure to record its mortgage interest before initiating foreclosure proceed<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>ings rendered the foreclosure sale void <em>ab initio. </em>It cited one case in support of its holding, <em>Davenport v HSBC Bank USA.</em><footnotemark><em>27</em></footnotemark><em> </em>There, the plaintiff, who was in default on her mortgage, brought an action to void a foreclosure. The defendant, who was the successor in interest of the initial mortgagee, had initiated the foreclosure proceeding several days before acquiring its interest in the mortgage. The trial court granted summary disposition to defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">The Court of Appeals reversed the trial court\u2019s ruling. It held that the defendant\u2019s failure to comply with MCL 600.3204(1)(d), which requires that a party own some or all of the indebtedness before foreclosing by advertisement, rendered the foreclosure proceedings void <em>ab </em>initio.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> But it cited not a single case in support of the proposition that the foreclosure was void <em>ab initio </em>as opposed to merely voidable.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\"><em>Davenport\u2019s </em>holding was contrary to the established precedent of this Court. We have long held that defective mortgage foreclosures are voidable. For example, in <em>Kuschinski v Equitable &amp; Central Trust </em>Co,<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> the Court considered a foreclosure undertaken in violation of a restraining order. The Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b372-6\">Our attention is called to a few isolated cases where under a different factual set-up, such sales have been held to be void. <em>The better rule seems to be that such sale is voidable and not void. </em>Plaintiff was not misled into believing that no sale had been had because of the order restraining such action. He knew of the sale and, although he was warned by defendants\u2019 attorneys, violated the rule <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>that in seeking to set aside a foreclosure sale, the moving party must act promptly after he becomes aware of the facts upon which he bases his complaint. The total lack of equity in plaintiffs claim, his failure to pay anything on the mortgage debt and his laches preclude him from any relief in a court of equity.[<footnotemark>30</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">Similarly, in <em>Feldman v Equitable Trust Co, </em>the Court held that a foreclosure commenced without first recording all assignments of the mortgage is not invalid if the defect does not harm the homeowner.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> This Court, the Court of Appeals, and the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan have consistently used this interpretation.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> We continue to adhere to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">Therefore, we hold that defects or irregularities in a foreclosure proceeding result in a foreclosure that is voidable, not void <em>ab initio. </em>Because the Court of Appeals erred by holding to the contrary, we reverse that portion of its decision. We leave to the trial court the determination of whether, under the facts presented, the foreclosure sale of plaintiffs\u2019 property is voidable. In this regard, to set aside the foreclosure sale, plaintiffs must show that they were prejudiced by defendant\u2019s failure to comply with MCL 600.3204. To <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>demonstrate such prejudice, they must show that they would have been in a better position to preserve their interest in the property absent defendant\u2019s noncompliance with the statute.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">III. RESPONSE TO THE DISSENT</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">At the outset, the dissent claims that the FDIC has more familiarity with the type of transaction that occurred in this case than does this Court. We do not underestimate the FDIC\u2019s grasp of what is involved in the liquidation of failed banking institutions. However, we are more familiar with the judicial review process of interpreting statutes and applying them to a set of facts than is an executive agency.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">The dissent states that pursuant to 12 USC 1821(d)(2)(G)(i)(I) and (II), the FDIC may merge a failed bank with or transfer a failed bank\u2019s assets to a financially healthy bank. It claims that, \u201c[u]nder either provision, the statute provides for transfers by operation of law.\u201d<footnotemark>34</footnotemark> This is simply false. Neither statutory provision indicates that either a merger or a transfer takes place by operation of law. The language of 12 USC 1821(d)(2)(G) is in stark contrast with that of 12 USC 1821(d)(2)(A), which explicitly provides that the FDIC succeeds to various property interests by operation of law. The dissent compounds its error by conflating the FDIC\u2019s statutory authority to <em>engage </em>in a transaction involving a failed bank\u2019s assets and liabilities with the <em>nature </em>of the transaction itself.<footnotemark>35</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"117\">*117</page-number>More problematic, however, is the dissent\u2019s failure to analyze the issue most central to this case: what is meant by a transfer by \u201coperation of law.\u201d The dissent states as an <em>ipse dixit </em>that \u201ca transfer by operation of law need not be involuntary . .. .\u201d<footnotemark>36</footnotemark> It cites not a trac\u00e9 of authority for this fiat. The dissent would also analyze whether a transaction took place by operation of law through the lens of the subjective intent of a related party.<footnotemark>37</footnotemark> This cannot be.<footnotemark>38</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b375-4\">By contrast, in giving meaning to the phrase \u201coperation of law,\u201d we have carefully considered decades-old precedent from this Court, as well as consulted a legal dictionary. We defer to these established authorities for the proposition that a transfer that takes place by operation of law is one that occurs unintentionally, involuntarily, or through no affirmative act of the transferee.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-5\">Finally, the dissent also errs in its alternative argument that defendant is exempt from MCL 600.3204(3) even if the transfer in question did not occur by operation of law. This argument hinges on the belief that defendant did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>acquire its interest in plaintiffs\u2019 mortgage by assignment. The statute plainly indicates that \u201ca record chain of title shall exist\u201d if the party foreclosing by advertisement \u201cis not the original mortgagee.\u201d It is undisputed that defendant is not the original mortgagee. Thus, regardless of <em>why </em>no chain of title exists, defendant cannot foreclose by advertisement.<footnotemark>39</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">Defendant acquired plaintiffs\u2019 mortgage through a voluntary purchase agreement with the FDIC. It follows that it did not acquire the mortgage by operation of law. Accordingly, defendant was required to record its interest in compliance with the provisions of MCL 600.3204 before foreclosing on the property by advertisement.

The dissent must decide this issue to support its position. In doing so, it acknowledges that changes have been made to the language of the foreclosure-by-advertisement statute during the 127 years since <em>Miller </em>was decided. It mentions that both versions \u201crequired the recordation of mortgage assignments before foreclosure was permitted.\u201d But it overlooks the fact that the 1871 statute required the recordation of assignments only \u201cif [the mortgage] shall have been assigned,\u201d 1871 CL 6913, whereas the current statute, MCL 600.3204(3), requires recordation if the foreclosing party \u201cis not the original mortgagee.\u201d These are two distinct triggering mechanisms for recordation. Moreover, the fact that in the 1871 statute the recordation requirement was triggered by assignment seems particularly significant. \u201cAssignment\u201d is defined as \u201c1. The transfer of rights or property. 2. The rights or property so transferred.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (9th ed). By contrast, as noted earlier, \u201coperation of law\u201d expresses devolution of a right absent the acts of a party, such as assignment, to obtain them. Thus, the <em>Miller </em>Court correctly focused on the voluntariness of transfer and concluded that involuntary transfers by operation of law did not trigger the recording requirement because they did not constitute assignments. The same conclusion cannot be made when construing the language of MCL 600.3204(3).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"27\">\n<p id=\"b372-7\"> <em>Davenport v HSBC Bank USA, </em>275 Mich App 344; 739 NW2d 383 (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"28\">\n<p id=\"b372-8\"> <em>Id. </em>at 347-348.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"29\">\n<p id=\"b372-9\"> <em>Kuschinski v Equitable &amp; Central Trust Co, </em>277 Mich 23; 268 NW 797 (1936).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"30\">\n<p id=\"b373-7\"> <em>Id. </em>at 26-27 (emphasis added) (citations omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"31\">\n<p id=\"b373-8\"> <em>Feldman v Equitable Trust Co, </em>278 Mich 619, 624-625; 270 NW 809 (1937).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"32\">\n<p id=\"b373-9\"> See, e.g., <em>Fox v Jacobs, </em>289 Mich 619, 624; 286 NW 854 (1939) (holding that the failure of a foreclosure notice to specify an assignee of the mortgage, as required by statute, did not render the foreclosure sale absolutely void, but only voidable); <em>Sweet Air Investment, Inc v Kenney, </em>275 Mich App 492, 502; 739 NW2d 656 (2007) (holding that a defect in notice renders a foreclosure sale voidable and not void); <em>Jackson Investment Corp v Pittsfield Prod, Inc, </em>162 Mich App 750, 756; 413 NW2d 99 (1987) (\u201cWe conclude that the trial court correctly held that the notice defect rendered the [foreclosure] sale voidable and not void.\u201d); <em>Worthy v World Wide Fin Servs, Inc, </em>347 F Supp 2d 502, 511 (ED Mich, 2004) (\u201c[E]ven if Defendant failed to comply with the foreclosure notice statute, I would not have sufficient grounds to invalidate the foreclosure sale, because of a lack of prejudice.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"33\">\n<p id=\"b374-8\"> See, generally, Kuschinski, 277 Mich at 26-27; <em>Sweet Mr, </em>275 Mich App at 503; <em>Jackson, </em>162 Mich App at 756.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"34\">\n<p id=\"b374-9\"> <em>Post </em>at 125.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"35\">\n<p id=\"b374-10\"> Similarly, the dissent\u2019s focus on which of WaMu\u2019s assets the FDIC transferred to defendant is irrelevant.

However, it would be more instructive for the development of our law to know what <em>affirmative </em>meaning the dissent would ascribe to \u201coperation of law.\u201d To the extent that some definition can be inferred from the dissent, that definition is, in my judgment, plainly incorrect. As the majority points out, the dissent essentially seeks to redefine the term \u201coperation of law\u201d to mean \u201cas provided by law.\u201d That is, the dissent argues that because the FDIC acted <em>pursuant to </em>or in <em>accordance with </em>federal statutes, its actions necessarily occurred by \u201coperation of law.\u201d Under this theory, it is difficult to envision any transfer of money or property, short of the payment of a bribe or blackmail, that would not occur by \u201coperation of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b377-3\">Second, it is difficult to ignore the dissent\u2019s repeated references to the fact that the transaction at issue \u201cwas not a simple contract for the sale of assets,\u201d <em>post </em>at 121, but rather constituted a \u201cspecialized transaction,\u201d see <em>post </em>at 121. Although the dissent makes several references to the \u201cspecial\u201d nature of the transaction, it fails to explain how that nature communicates any <em>legal </em>significance. In fact, there is no obvious reason, and the dissent supplies none, for the proposition that the assertedly \u201cspecial\u201d nature of the instant transaction has any bearing on the determination of whether a transfer is or is not by \u201coperation of law.\u201d Certainly, that the transfer was \u201cspecial\u201d has nothing to do with the <em>voluntariness </em>of the transfer. The dissent\u2019s emphasis in this regard only has the effect of obscuring the legal realities of this case that <em>are </em>relevant.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>Third, I believe it deserves emphasis that the dissent\u2019s contention that the FDIC\u2019s characterization of the transfer should be accorded \u201crespectful consideration\u201d and the authorities cited in support of this contention, <em>post </em>at 124 n 10, are inapposite. To begin with, this case is concerned with <em>Michigan </em>law, not <em>federal </em>law. The critical issue is whether Chase satisfied the <em>Michigan </em>\u201cforeclosure by advertisement\u201d statute, which implicates whether the transfer from the FDIC to Chase was accomplished by \u201coperation of law,\u201d as that phrase is understood under <em>Michigan </em>caselaw. Thus, clearly only issues of <em>Michigan </em>law are involved. Furthermore, even if the issues in this case <em>did </em>implicate federal law, the FDIC\u2019s purported \u201cguidance\u201d is offered through an affidavit submitted by an individual \u201creceiver in charge\u201d for the FDIC. This affidavit is not the statement of the governing board of directors of the FDIC, it is not the statement of any single member of the governing board of directors of the FDIC, and it certainly is not the fruit of rulemaking or adjudication by the FDIC.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> As the United States Supreme Court advised in <em>United States v Mead Corp, </em>533 US 218, 229; 121 S Ct 2164; 150 L Ed 2d 292 (2001), \u201c[a] very good indicator of delegation meriting [deference] is [an] express congressional authorization[] to engage in the rulemaking or adjudication process that produces the regulations or rulings for which deference is claimed.\u201d There is an utter absence of any such \u201cindicator\u201d in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">Finally, I would offer additional guidance to the trial court concerning the nature of the \u201cprejudice\u201d that plaintiffs must demonstrate in order to set aside the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"121\">*121</page-number>foreclosure. Although a nonexhaustive listing, some of the factors that might be relevant in this demonstration would include the following: whether plaintiffs were \u201cmisled into believing that no sale had been had,\u201d <em>Kuschinski v Equitable &amp; Central Trust Co, </em>277 Mich 23, 26; 268 NW 797 (1936); whether plaintiffs \u201cact[ed] promptly after [they became] aware of the facts\u201d on which they based their complaint, <em>id.; </em>whether plaintiffs made an effort to redeem the property during the redemption period, <em>Sweet Air Investment, Inc v Kenney, </em>275 Mich App 492, 503; 739 NW2d 656 (2007); whether plaintiffs were \u201crepresented by counsel throughout the foreclosure process,\u201d <em>Jackson Investment Corp v Pittsfield Prod, Inc, </em>162 Mich App 750, 756; 413 NW2d 99 (1987); and whether defendant \u201crelied on the apparent validity of the sale by taking steps to protect its interest in the subject property,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 757.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b378-7\"> For these reasons, I would also characterize differently than does the majority opinion the \u201cFDIC\u2019s affidavit,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 112 n 25, and the \u201cFDIC\u2019s position,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 111 n 22.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b379-4\">ZAHRA, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ak\"><em>(dissenting). </em>I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s conclusion that plaintiffs\u2019 mortgage did not pass to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., by operation of law. Under federal law, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) has broad statutory powers for resolving the business of a failed bank. The FDIC\u2019s transfer of plaintiffs\u2019 mortgage to Chase was part of a larger, specialized transaction authorized under federal law that was undertaken by the FDIC to resolve the business of Washington Mutual Bank (WaMu), a failed bank. Pursuant to this federal authority, the FDIC was permitted to transfer the assets of WaMu \u201cwithout any approval, assignment, or consent. .. ,\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The particular transaction consummated here was not a simple contract for the sale of assets, as characterized by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>majority. The majority\u2019s conclusions represent a fundamental misunderstanding of the FDIC\u2019s authority to liquidate WaMu.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">Michigan law has long recognized that a mortgage obtained by operation of law need not be recorded before foreclosure is allowed because the successor mortgagee steps into the shoes of the original mortgagee.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Because Chase obtained plaintiffs\u2019 mortgage from the FDIC by operation of law, I would hold it exempt from the recordation requirement of MCL 600.3204(3). I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">I. ALL TRANSFERS OF ASSETS UNDER 12 USC 1821(d)(2)(G)(i) OCCUR BY OPERATION OF LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">The majority correctly concludes that \u201cwhen the FDIC succeeded to WaMu\u2019s assets, which included plaintiffs\u2019 mortgage, it did so by clear operation of a statutory provision \u2014 12 USC 1821(d)(2)(A). With respect to this transfer, the FDIC acquired plaintiffs\u2019 mortgage by operation of law.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> But I disagree with the majority that the subsequent transfer, from the FDIC to Chase, did not occur by operation of law. In fact, the FDIC transferred WaMu\u2019s assets to Chase by operation of another statutory provision \u2014 12 USC 1821(d) (2) (G) (i) (II). This provision empowers the FDIC to resolve the business of a failed bank by transferring any asset or liability \u201cwithout any approval, assignment, or consent with respect to such transfer.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">The majority, following the erroneous logic employed by the Court of Appeals, characterizes the transaction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>between the FDIC and Chase as a simple contractual sale.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Simply put, this characterization fundamentally misunderstands the structure of the agreement. Rather than an ordinary sale of assets, this was a specialized transaction facilitated by the FDIC in accordance with its mandate to resolve the businesses of failed banks.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The FDIC, through its statutory powers, enabled a transition in which it stepped into WaMu\u2019s shoes as receiver and took possession of WaMu\u2019s assets and liabilities without any assignment; then, almost instantaneously, the FDIC transferred substantially all of WaMu\u2019s assets and liabilities to Chase. This transfer of assets was intended to be accomplished by operation of law and again without an assignment. The FDIC confirmed as much in its October 2, 2008, affidavit, which it executed contemporaneously with the transfer. In pertinent part, the FDIC stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-4\">2. On September 25, 2008, Washington Mutual Bank, formerly known as Washington Mutual Bank, FA (\u201cWashington Mutual\u201d), was closed by the Office of Thrift Supervision and the FDIC was named receiver.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-5\">3.

Pursuant to 12 USC 1821 (d) (2) (G) (i), the FDIC as receiver may either merge a failed bank with a healthy bank<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> or transfer any asset or liability of the failed bank \u201cwithout any approval, assignment, or consent with respect to such transfer.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Under either provision, the statute provides for transfers by operation of law. If the FDIC attempted to transfer assets of a failed bank <em>without </em>relying on one of the provisions of 12 USC 1821 (d) (2) (G) (i), it would be acting outside the scope of its statutory authority.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">The majority erroneously concludes that a transfer completed by operation of law must be one that occurred involuntarily, ignoring basic business realities. For example, when two companies merge \u2014 an action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>requiring affirmative intent and, often, substantial consideration<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> \u2014 the law is settled that the assets of the merging companies vest in the resulting company <em>by operation of law.</em><footnotemark><em>15</em></footnotemark><em> </em>And even the majority admits that a merger results in the transfer of assets by operation of law.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Thus, the majority\u2019s conclusion that a transfer by operation of law can only occur involuntarily simply does not follow.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">Moreover, the majority\u2019s conclusion that operation-of-law transfers must be fully involuntary ignores the standards applicable to the most fundamental operation-of-law transactions. Surely the majority would agree that transfers accomplished by intestacy or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>a joint tenancy occur by operation of law.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Yet neither of these traditional operation-of-law transfers can be completed without the affirmative decision of the recipient to accept the property.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Michigan law allows a party to disclaim an operation-of-law conveyance.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Thus, a transfer by operation of law cannot occur unless the recipient <em>voluntarily </em>decides not to exercise his or her right to disclaim the conveyance. Our sister court in New Hampshire eloquently described the rationale behind a right of disclaimer:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b385-5\">[W]e held that a devisee has the power to renounce a testamentary gift. An intestate heir also may disclaim an intestate share under our common law. The same is true of a right of survivorship in a joint tenancy.... The motivating factor permitting renunciation of these interests is that one should not be forced to accept burdensome, unbar-gained for tenders.[<footnotemark>20</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>By similar logic, the fact that Chase could have refused, but voluntarily accepted, the transfer does not destroy its character as an operation-of-law transaction.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">Having established that a transfer by operation of law need not be involuntary, I have no trouble concluding that the instant transaction was completed by operation of law. I am also not troubled by the conclusion that the FDIC/Chase transaction was for all intents and purposes the equivalent of a merger. By this transaction, Chase absorbed substantially all of WaMu\u2019s assets and liabilities. In a September 25, 2008, press release announcing the transaction, FDIC Chairman Sheila C. Bair called the transaction \u201csimply a combination of two banks.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Chase did not sort through the various assets of WaMu and pick and choose only the most appealing items; it absorbed the entire bank except for very select assets and liabilities that remained with the receiver.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> The first page of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>purchase and assumption (P&amp;A) agreement indicates that Chase acquired much more than a loan portfolio, stating that with the FDIC acting as the conduit, it received \u201csubstantially all of the assets and assumed] all deposit and substantially all other liabilities\u201d of WaMu.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> And while the P&amp;A agreement established the framework for the transfer, the actual transaction was completed under the FDIC\u2019s statutory authority to transfer assets and liabilities \u201cwithout any approval, assignment, or consent. . . .\u201d<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Having received the assets and liabilities without any assignment, Chase stepped into WaMu\u2019s shoes and began occupying WaMu\u2019s legal status. While this conclusion is perhaps the result of a legal fiction, like a merger, this is the manner in which the law treats these transactions. Accordingly, no further formalities were necessary to vest the rights Chase acquired from WaMu because, as with a merger, they vested upon completion of the deal.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">At its heart, the majority\u2019s and the Court of Appeals\u2019 errors are in redefining this transaction, giving short shrift to the specialized context in which it occurred. The FDIC and Chase did not execute a simple contractual sale; it was a transfer of assets and liabilities consummated without any assignments that only could have been completed under the FDIC\u2019s statutory authority for resolving failed banks. Accordingly, I would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>hold that Chase acquired plaintiffs\u2019 mortgage by operation of law.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">II. THE RECORDING REQUIREMENT OF MCL 600.3204(3) DOES NOT APPLY TO TRANSACTIONS PROPERLY COMPLETED WITHOUT ASSIGNMENT, INCLUDING MORTGAGES ACQUIRED BY OPERATION OF LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">MCL 600.3204 provides the requirements for foreclosure by advertisement. MCL 600.3204(1) lists the four general requirements before a mortgagee can foreclose:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-8\">(a) A default in a condition of the mortgage has occurred, by which the power to sell became operative.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-9\">(b) An action or proceeding has not been instituted, at law, to recover the debt secured by the mortgage or any part of the mortgage; or, if an action or proceeding has been instituted, the action or proceeding has been discontinued; or an execution on a judgment rendered in an action or proceeding has been returned unsatisfied, in whole or in part.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-10\">(c) The mortgage containing the power of sale has been properly recorded.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-11\">(d) The party foreclosing the mortgage is either the owner of the indebtedness or of an interest in the indebtedness secured by the mortgage or the servicing agent of the mortgage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b388-12\">MCL 600.3204(3) states an additional requirement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b388-13\">If the party foreclosing a mortgage by advertisement is not the original mortgagee, a record chain of title shall exist prior to the date of sale under [MCL 600.3216] <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>[setting the conditions for the sheriffs sale] evidencing the assignment of the mortgage to the party foreclosing the mortgage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">Chase was exempt from the requirements of MCL 600.3204(3) because it obtained the mortgage by operation of law. The key phrase in making this determination is \u201cevidencing the assignment.\u201d If there has been no assignment \u2014 i.e., if the mortgage was transferred by operation of law \u2014 then there can be no chain of title because the party holding the mortgage is, by law, the original mortgagee. This is so even if the party holding the mortgage was not the party that actually recorded the mortgage. In other words, the statute implies that when no assignment has occurred, the party holding the mortgage has stepped into the shoes of the original mortgagee. When there has been no assignment of a mortgage, there can be no assignment to record. Accordingly, because Chase acquired the plaintiffs\u2019 mortgage by operation of law instead of by assignment, and was thus legally considered the original mortgagee, it was not required to record anything in the chain of title.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Michigan law has long recognized that only transfers completed by assignment need to be recorded before foreclosure by advertisement is permitted. In the 1885 decision of <em>Miller v Clark, </em>this Court analyzed the foreclosure-by-advertisement statute and determined that mortgages obtained by operation of law need not be recorded before foreclosure by advertisement is permitted.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> In <em>Miller, </em>the mortgagee was an individual who died with the mortgage passing as part of his estate to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"132\">*132</page-number>the guardian of his heirs.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The guardian foreclosed on the mortgage without recording it.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> This Court, in discussing whether the recording requirement applied to the peculiar way that the guardian came to possess the mortgage <em>without </em>an assignment, held that \u201c[t]he assignments which are required to be recorded are those which are executed by the voluntary act of the party, and <em>this does not apply to cases where the title is transferred by operation of law . </em>.. .\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> So if there is no assignment to record because the mortgage passed by operation of law, then the recording requirement does not apply.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark> Because Chase obtained the plaintiffs\u2019 mortgage without an assignment pursuant to the FDIC\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"133\">*133</page-number>statutory authority, MCL 600.3204(3) did not require Chase to record the mortgage before foreclosing.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-4\">Alternatively, it is not at all clear that the transfer must even be characterized as one completed by operation of law to be exempt from the recordation requirement of MCL 600.3204(3). Indeed, the statutory language itself does not explicitly exempt transfers completed by operation of law; instead, it requires recordation when there <em>is </em>an assignment.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> So in 1885, when this Court held that an operation-of-law transaction was exempt from the recordation requirement, it did so not because the transaction <em>was </em>completed by operation of law but because the transaction <em>was not </em>an assignment.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> Thus, even if the instant transaction was not by operation of law per se, it would still be exempt from the recording statute if no recordable assignment existed. And indeed, pursuant to 12 USC 1821 (d)(2)(G)(i)(II), the FDIC transferred WaMu\u2019s assets to Chase without an assignment. So even accepting the majority\u2019s conclusion that this was <em>not </em>a transfer by operation of law, MCL 600.3204(3) would still not apply because no assignment existed and none was necessary to complete the transfer.<footnotemark>33</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A-\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"134\">*134</page-number>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b392-4\">By redefining the character of the transaction between the FDIC and Chase, the majority, like the Court of Appeals before it, erroneously concludes that it was an ordinary contractual sale rather than a specialized transfer by operation of law. In reality, the transaction was possible only because of the FDIC\u2019s special statutory powers for resolving the business of a failed bank like WaMu. Moreover, Chase was not required to record the mortgage before foreclosing because it obtained the mortgage by operation of law and stepped into WaMu\u2019s shoes as the original mortgagee. Thus, the recording requirement of the foreclosure-by-advertisement statute was inapplicable. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent and would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.<footnotemark>34</footnotemark></p>\n<judges id=\"b392-5\">Young, C.

The majority instead chooses to entirely ignore the FDIC\u2019s position that it, in fact, transferred the WaMu assets to Chase by operation of law. While we are ultimately interpreting the requirements of MCL 600.3204(3), the question whether the transfer at issue occurred \u201cby operation of law\u201d truly concerns the character of the transaction as defined by federal law, which the FDIC is tasked with administering.
