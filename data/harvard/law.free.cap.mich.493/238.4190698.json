No Michigan case has ever allowed a plaintiff to recover noneconomic damages resulting solely from the negligent destruction of property, either real or personal. Rather, the common law of this state has long provided that the appropriate measure of damages in cases involving the negligent destruction of property is simply the cost of replacement or repair of the property. We are not persuaded of the need for change and therefore continue to adhere to this rule. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand this case to the trial court for entry of summary disposition in defendant\u2019s favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-10\">I. FACTS AND HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b498-11\">In 1975, plaintiff and her now ex-husband built a house in DeWitt, Michigan. The house was originally heated by an oil furnace located in the basement, but in 2006 plaintiff replaced the oil furnace with a propane furnace. Plaintiff canceled her contract with defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>oil company\u2019s predecessor when the propane furnace was installed. Although the oil furnace was removed, the oil fill pipe remained.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">Somehow, in November 2007, plaintiffs address was placed on defendant\u2019s \u201ckeep full list.\u201d True to the name of the list, while plaintiff was at work, defendant\u2019s truck driver pumped nearly 400 gallons of fuel oil into plaintiffs basement through the oil fill pipe before realizing his mistake and immediately calling 911. Plaintiffs house and many of her belongings were destroyed. Between defendant\u2019s and plaintiffs insurers, the site was remedi-ated, a new house was built on the property in a different location, plaintiffs personal property was cleaned or replaced, and plaintiff was reimbursed for all temporary-housing-related expenses. It is undisputed that plaintiff was fully compensated for her economic losses.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">Nevertheless, plaintiff filed suit in August 2008, alleging claims for negligence, gross negligence, negligent infliction of emotional distress, nuisance, trespass, and a private claim under the Natural Resources and Environmental Protection Act, MCL 324.101 <em>et seq. </em>However, plaintiffs only claim to survive to trial was for the recovery of noneconomic damages for defendant\u2019s negligent destruction of her real property. After trial and over defendant\u2019s objection, a jury found in favor of plaintiff in the amount of $100,000 for past noneco-nomic damages. Defendant moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and remittitur, arguing that plaintiff had failed to present sufficient proofs to support the verdict. The trial court denied the motion, and defendant appealed. The Court of Appeals affirmed in a published decision, explaining:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b499-7\">Noneconomic damages are generally recoverable in tort claims, and we are not convinced that noneconomic damages stemming from damage to or destruction of real property <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>must or should be excepted from that general rule. We conclude that in negligence actions, a plaintiff may recover mental anguish damages naturally flowing from the damage to or destruction of real property. <em>[Price v High Pointe Oil Co, Inc, </em>294 Mich App 42, 60; 817 NW2d 583 (2011).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">Defendant applied for leave to appeal in this Court. We granted leave and subsequently heard oral argument. <em>Price v High Pointe Oil Co, Inc, </em>491 Mich 870 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b500-7\">Whether noneconomic damages are recoverable for the negligent destruction of real property presents a question of law, which this Court reviews de novo. See <em>2000 Baum Family Trust v Babel, </em>488 Mich 136, 143; 793 NW2d 633 (2010).</p>\n<p id=\"b500-8\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b500-9\">The question in this case is whether noneconomic damages are recoverable for the negligent destruction of real property. Absent any relevant statute, the answer to that question is a matter of common law.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-10\">A. COMMON LAW</p>\n<p id=\"b500-11\">As this Court explained in <em>Bugbee v Fowle, </em>the common law \u201c \u2018is but the accumulated expressions of the various judicial tribunals in their efforts to ascertain what is right and just between individuals in respect to private disputes[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Bugbee v Fowle, </em>277 Mich 485, 492; 269 NW 570 (1936), quoting <em>Kansas v Colorado, </em>206 US 46, 97; 27 S Ct 655; 51 L Ed 956 (1907). The common law, however, is not static. By its nature, it adapts to changing circumstances. See Holmes, <em>The Common Law </em>(Mineola, New York: Dover Publications, Inc., 1991), p 1 (noting that the common <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>law is affected by \u201c[t]he felt necessities of the time, the prevalent moral and political theories, [and] intuitions of public policy\u201d and that it \u201cembodies the story of a nation\u2019s development through many centuries\u201d). And as this Court stated in <em>Beech Grove Investment Co v Civil Rights </em>Comm:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-5\">It is generally agreed that two of the most significant features of the common law are: (1) its capacity for growth and (2) its capacity to reflect the public policy of a given era....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b501-6\">\u201cThe common law does not consist of definite rules which are absolute, fixed, and immutable like the statute law, but it is a flexible body of principles which are designed to meet, and are susceptible of adaption to, among other things, new institutions, public policies, conditions, usages and practices, and changes in mores, trade, commerce, inventions, and increasing knowledge, as the progress of society may require. So, changing conditions may give rise to new rights under the law ... .\u201d <em>[Beech Grove Investment Co v Civil Rights Comm, </em>380 Mich 405, 429-430; 157 NW2d 213 (1968), quoting 15A CJS, Common Law, \u00a7 2, pp 43-44.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">The common law is always a work in progress and typically develops incrementally, i.e., gradually evolving as individual disputes are decided and existing common-law rules are considered and sometimes adapted to current needs in light of changing times and circumstances. <em>In re Arbitration Between Allstate Ins Co &amp; Stolarz, </em>81 NY2d 219, 226; 597 NYS2d 904; 613 NE2d 936 (1993) (noting that the common law evolves through the \u201cincremental process of common-law adjudication as a response to the facts presented\u201d);<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> see also <em>People v Aaron, </em>409 Mich 672, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>727; 299 NW2d 304 (1980) (\u201cAbrogation of the felony-murder rule is not a drastic move in light of the significant restrictions this Court has already imposed.

Accordingly, the long-held common-law rule in Michigan is that the measure of damages for the negligent destruction of property is the cost of replacement or repair.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because replacement and repair costs reflect <em>economic </em>damages, the logical implication of this rule is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"248\">*248</page-number>that the measure of damages excludes <em>noneconomic </em>damages and the latter are not recoverable for the negligent destruction of property.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> See also 4 Restate<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>ment Torts, 2d, \u00a7 911 comment e, p 475 (\u201cCompensatoxy damages are not given for emotional distress caused merely by the loss of... things 1 Dobbs, Law of Remedies (2d ed, 1993), Damages-Equity-Restitution, \u00a7 5.15(1), p 876 (\u201cIn general, the owner of damaged property cannot recover damages for emotional distress as an element of damage to the property.\u201d); 22 Am Jur 2d, Damages, \u00a7 255, pp 238-239; 38 Am Jur 2d, Fright, Shock, Etc, \u00a7 19, p 31 (\u201cSubject to some exceptions, generally, under ordinary circumstances, there can be no recovery for mental anguish suffered by a plaintiff in connection with an injury to his or her property\u201d); 2 Restatement Torts, 2d, \u00a7 313, pp 113-115 (implying that damages for emotional distress are not recoverable in cases concerning negligently inflicted injury to property);<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Restatement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>Torts, 2d, \u00a7 911 comment e, p 474 (\u201cEven when the subject matter has its chief value in its value for use by the injured person, if the thing is replaceable, the damages for its loss are limited to replacement value, less an amount for depreciation.\u201d); 28 ALR2d 1070, \u00a7 8, p 1093 (\u201cIn simple negligence cases involving personal property, the courts have been reluctant to authorize the allowance of damages for mental anguish or disturbance allegedly caused by the defendant\u2019s wrongful acts.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">Lending additional support to this conclusion is the simple fact that, before the Court of Appeals\u2019 opinion below, <em>no </em>case ever in the history of the Michigan common law has approvingly discussed the recovery of noneconomic damages for the negligent destruction of property. Indeed, no case has even broached this issue except through the negative implication arising from limiting damages for the negligent destruction or damage of property to replacement and repair costs. Put another way, despite the fact that throughout the course of our state\u2019s history, many thousands of houses and other real properties have doubtlessly been negligently destroyed or damaged, and despite the fact that surely in a great many, if not a majority, of those cases the residents and owners of those properties suffered considerable emotional distress, there is not a single Michigan judicial decision that expressly or impliedly supports the recovery of noneconomic damages in these circumstances.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Thus, supplementing the affirmative judicial decisions that we have cited in support of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>limiting principles of the common law for the calculation of property damages is the absence of even a single affirmative judicial decision in support of the contrary proposition, a proposition that one would expect to have become commonplace within the law if it had ever existed. However, this particular dog has been perpetually silent and has never barked.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">Moreover, the Court of Appeals has decided two relatively recent cases concerning injury to <em>personal </em>property in which noneconomic damages were disallowed. In <em>Koester v VCA Animal Hosp, </em>244 Mich App 173; 624 NW2d 209 (2000), the plaintiff dog owner sought noneconomic damages in a tort action against his veterinarian following the death of his dog resulting from the veterinarian\u2019s negligence. The trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion for summary disposition, holding that \u201cemotional damages for the loss of a dog do not exist.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 175. On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed, noting that pets are personal property under Michigan law and explaining that there \u201cis no Michigan precedent that permits the recovery of damages for emotional injuries allegedly suffered as a consequence of property damage.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 176.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-6\">Later, in <em>Bernhardt v Ingham Regional Med Ctr, </em>249 Mich App 274; 641 NW2d 868 (2002), the plaintiff visited the defendant hospital to bring home her adopted, newborn son. Before washing her hands, the plaintiff removed her jewelry, which consisted of her grandmother\u2019s 1897 wedding ring (which was also her wedding ring) and a watch purchased in 1980 around the time of her brother\u2019s murder. The plaintiff accidentally forgot the jewelry in the washbasin and left the hospital. Upon realizing her mistake, the plaintiff contacted the defendant and was advised that she could retrieve the jewelry from hospital security. However, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"252\">*252</page-number>when she tried to retrieve the jewelry, it could not be located. The plaintiff sued, and the defendant moved for summary disposition, arguing that the plaintiffs damages did not exceed the $25,000 jurisdictional limit of the trial court. The plaintiff countered that her damages exceeded that limit because the jewelry possessed great sentimental value. The trial court granted the defendant\u2019s motion. On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed, citing <em>Koester, </em>109 Mich App at 176, for the proposition that there \u201cis no Michigan precedent that permits the recovery of damages for emotional injuries allegedly suffered as a consequence of property damage,\u201d <em>Bernhardt, </em>249 Mich App at 279. <em>Bernhardt </em>concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-5\">In the present case, the two items of jewelry have a market value that can easily be ascertained. Hence, fair market value is the measure of damages. Because the items have a fair market value, there is no need to resort to an alternative measure of damages to compensate plaintiff for her loss. <em>[Id. </em>at 281.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">In support of its conclusion, <em>Bernhardt </em>quoted the following language from the Restatement Second of Torts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b510-7\">If the subject matter cannot be replaced, however, as in the case of a destroyed or lost family portrait, the owner will be compensated for its special value to him, as evidenced by the original cost, and the quality and condition at the time of the loss.... In these cases, however, damages cannot be based on sentimental value. Compensatory damages are not given for emotional distress caused merely by the loss of the things, except that in unusual circumstances damages may be awarded for humiliation caused by deprivation, as when one is deprived of essential elements of clothing. <em>[Id. </em>at 281, quoting 4 Restatement Torts, 2d, \u00a7 911, comment e, pp 474-475 (quotation marks omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b511-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"253\">*253</page-number>While <em>Koester </em>and <em>Bernhardt </em>both involved negligent injury to <em>personal </em>property, they speak of property generally.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Although the Court of Appeals in the instant case seeks to draw distinctions between personal and real property, neither that Court nor plaintiff has explained how any of those distinctions, even if they had some pertinent foundation in the law, are relevant with regard to the propriety of awarding noneconomic damages.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In short, while it is doubtlessly true that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>many people are highly emotionally attached to their houses, many people are also highly emotionally attached to their pets,<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> their heirlooms, their collections, and any number of other things. But there is no legally relevant basis that would logically justify prohibiting the recovery of noneconomic damages for the negligent killing of a pet or the negligent loss of a family heirloom but allow such a recovery for the negligent destruction of a house.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Accordingly, <em>Koester </em>and <em>Bernhardt </em>underscore <em>O\u2019Donnell\u2019s </em>exclusion of noneconomic damages for negligent injury to real and personal property.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">Finally, we would be remiss if we did not address <em>Sutter v Biggs, </em>377 Mich 80, 86; 139 NW2d 684 (1966) (concerning a medical malpractice claim in which the plaintiffs ovary and fallopian tube were removed without her consent), which the Court of Appeals cited as providing the \u201cgeneral rule\u201d for the recovery of damages in tort actions. <em>Sutter </em>stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b512-6\">The general rule, expressed in terms of damages, and long followed in this State, is that in a tort action, the tort-feasor is liable for all injuries resulting directly from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>his wrongful act, whether foreseeable or not, provided the damages are the legal and natural consequences of the wrongful act, and are such as, according to common experience and the usual course of events, might reasonably have been anticipated. Remote contingent, or speculative damages are not considered in conformity to the general rule. <em>Van Keulen &amp; Winchester Lumber Co. v. Manistee and Northeastern Railroad Co., </em>222 Mich 682 [193 NW 289 (1923)]; <em>Woodyard v. Barnett, </em>335 Mich 352 [56 NW2d 214 (1953)]; and <em>Fisk v.

With respect to this case, although <em>Sutter </em>articulated a general rule, <em>O\u2019Donnell </em>articulated a more specific \u201cgeneral rule,\u201d applicable in negligence actions in which there is only property damage. Accordingly, because this case involves only property damage, the <em>O\u2019Donnell </em>rule, not the <em>Sutter </em>rule, controls.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b515-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>B.

With that understanding, we address whether the common law <em>should </em>be altered.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">\u201cThis Court is the principal steward of Michigan\u2019s common law,\u201d <em>Henry v Dow Chem Co, </em>473 Mich 63, 83; 701 NW2d 684 (2005), and it is \u201caxiomatic that our courts have the constitutional authority to change the common law in the proper case,\u201d <em>North Ottawa Community Hosp v Kieft, </em>457 Mich 394, 403 n 9; 578 NW2d 267 (1998). This authority is traceable to Const 1963, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>art 3, \u00a7 7, which states, \u201cThe common law and the statute laws now in force, not repugnant to this constitution, shall remain in force until they expire by their own limitations, or are changed, amended or repealed.\u201d Thus, as this Court has explained, \u201cthe common-law rule remains the law until modified by this Court or by the Legislature.\u201d <em>Longstreth v Gensel, </em>423 Mich 675, 686; 377 NW2d 804 (1985). However, this Court has also explained that alteration of the common law should be approached cautiously with the fullest consideration of public policy and should not occur through sudden departure from longstanding legal rules. <em>Henry, </em>473 Mich at 83 (\u201c[O]ur common-law jurisprudence has been guided by a number of prudential principles. See Young, A <em>judicial traditionalist confronts the common law, </em>8 Texas Rev L &amp; Pol 299, 305-310 (2004). Among them has been our attempt to \u2018avoid capricious departures from bedrock legal rules as such tectonic shifts might produce unforeseen and undesirable consequences,\u2019 <em>id. </em>at 307 . . ..\u201d); see also <em>Woodman, </em>486 Mich at 231 (opinion by YOUNG, J.) (\u201c[Modifications [of the common law] should be made with the utmost caution because it is difficult for the judiciary to assess the competing interests that may be at stake and the societal trade-offs relevant to one modification of the common law versus another in relation to the existing rule.\u201d); <em>id. </em>at 268 (MARKMAN, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (explaining that the common law develops incrementally); <em>North Ottawa, </em>457 Mich at 403 n 9 (providing that common law should only be changed \u201cin the proper case\u201d).<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> As this emphasis on incrementalism suggests, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>when it comes to alteration of the common law, the traditional rule must prevail absent compelling reasons for change. This approach ensures continuity and stability in the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">With the foregoing principles in mind, we respectfully decline to alter the common-law rule that the appropriate measure of damages for negligently damaged property is the cost of replacement or repair. We are not oblivious to the reality that destruction of property or property damage will often engender considerable mental distress, and we are quite prepared to believe that the particular circumstances of the instant case were sufficient to have caused exactly such distress. However, we are persuaded that the present rule is a rational one and justifiable as a matter of reasonable public policy. We recognize that might also be true of alternative rules that could be constructed by this Court. In the final analysis, however, the venerability of the present rule and the lack of any compelling argument that would suggest its objectionableness in light of changing social and economic circumstances weigh, in our judgment, in favor of its retention. Because we believe the rule to be sound, if change is going to come, it must come by legislative alteration.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> A number of factors persuade us that the longstanding character of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>the present rule is not simply a function of serendipity or of judicial inertia, but is reflective of the fact that the rule serves legitimate purposes and values within our legal system.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">First, one of the most fundamental principles of our economic system is that the market sets the price of property. This is so even though every individual values property differently as a function of his or her own particular preferences. Inherent in this principle is that any property an individual owns is presumably <em>valued by that individual </em>at or above its market rate. Otherwise, he or she presumably would not have purchased the property or continue to own it. Just as an individual typically does not pay for this surplus value, the law does not necessarily compensate that individual where that surplus value has been lost.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">Second, economic damages, unlike noneconomic damages, are easily verifiable, quantifiable, and mea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>surable. Thus, when measured only in terms of economic damages, the value of property is easily ascertainable. Employing market prices in calculating compensation for property damage eliminates the need to engage in subjective determinations of property value and enables the legal system to undertake commonplace and precise determinations of value. This explains why, at least where the plaintiff has not sustained physical injury, the cost of the property\u2019s replacement or repair has been the traditional standard for making a plaintiff \u201cwhole\u201d under the law. See <em>Valentine v Gen American Credit, Inc, </em>420 Mich 256, 261; 362 NW2d 628 (1984); <em>Bernhardt, </em>249 Mich App at 279. This is so despite the fact that nearly every case involves <em>some </em>measure of emotional harm \u2014 if only from the stress of litigation \u2014 to victimized parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">Third, limiting damages to the economic value of the damaged or destroyed property limits disparities in damage awards from case to case. Disparities in recovery are inherent in legal matters in which the value of what is in dispute is neither tangible nor objectively determined, but rather intangible and subjectively determined. Whereas under the present rule, all plaintiffs suffering an identical harm to their properties are compensated on a uniform basis, under the Court of Appeals\u2019 rule, there would be as many levels of compensation as there are plaintiffs because no two plaintiffs would likely react to the damage or destruction of their properties in exactly the same fashion. Indeed, both objective and subjective disparities would result. Objective disparities would arise because, even if noneco-nomic harms were precisely quantifiable, identical injuries to identical properties could lead to severe mental distress for one person, while causing only minor annoyance for another. Subjective disparities would arise because noneconomic harms <em>cannot </em>be precisely quan<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>tified, so we must normally rely on juries to determine (1) whether noneconomic harms were caused, (2) the extent of such harms, and (3) the monetary value of such harms. The disparity in assessing damages by different fact-finders would presumably compound with each step in this chain of conjecture.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Fourth, the present rule affords some reasonable level of certainty to businesses regarding the potential scope of their liability for accidents caused to property resulting from their negligent conduct. As explained earlier in this opinion, under the Court of Appeals\u2019 rule, those businesses that come into regular contact with real property \u2014 contractors, repairmen, and fuel suppliers, for example \u2014 would be exposed to the uncertainty of not knowing whether their exposure to tort liability will be defined by a plaintiff who has an unusual emotional attachment to the property or by a jury that has an unusually sympathetic opinion toward those emotional attachments. Insurers would have a similarly difficult time calculating the extent of the risks against which they are insuring. Schwartz &amp; Laird, <em>Non-economic damages in pet litigation: The serious need to preserve a rational rule, </em>33 Pepp L R 227, 261 (2006) (\u201cWhen wild-card non-economic damages are added to the equation, however, actuaries cannot accurately predict the likely costs of lawsuits.\u201d), citing Huss, <em>Valuation in veterinary malpractice, </em>35 Loy U Chi L J 479, 532 (2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Once again, it is not our view that the common-law rule in Michigan cannot be improved, or that it represents the best of all possible rules, only that the rule is a reasonable one and has survived for as long as it has because there is some reasonable basis for the rule and that no compelling reasons for replacing it have been set forth by either the Court of Appeals or plaintiff. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>therefore leave it to the Legislature, if it chooses to do so at some future time, to more carefully balance the benefits of the current rule with what that body might come to view as its shortcomings.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">The issue in this case is whether noneconomic damages are recoverable for the negligent destruction of real property. No Michigan case has ever allowed a plaintiff to recover noneconomic damages resulting solely from the negligent destruction of property, either real or personal. Rather, the common law of this state has long provided that the appropriate measure of damages in cases involving the negligent destruction of property is simply the cost of replacement or repair of the negligently destroyed property. We continue today to adhere to this rule and decline to alter it. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand this case to the trial court for entry of summary disposition in defendant\u2019s favor.</p>\n<judges id=\"b522-6\">Young, C.J., and Mary Beth Kelly and Zahra, JJ., concurred with MARKMAN, J.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b522-7\">CAVANAGH, J., took no part in the decision of this case because of a familial relationship with counsel of record.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b522-8\">MCCORMACK and Viviano, JJ., took no part in the decision of this case.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b501-8\"> See also Kestin, <em>The bystander\u2019s cause of action for emotional injury: Reflections on the relational eligibility standard, </em>26 Seton Hall L R 512, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"244\">*244</page-number>512 (1996) (\u201cGrowth in the common law is incremental, often scarcely noticeable in the short run, but inexorable when viewed in the long term.\u201d); <em>Davis v Moore, </em>772 A2d 204, 238 (DC, 2001) (Ruiz, J., dissenting) (\u201cIt cannot be forgotten that the incremental pace at which common law develops, coupled with the increasing importance of statutory law, ensures that cases where truly \u2018new\u2019 rules of common law are announced ... will not frequently occur.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b502-8\"> <em>Tillson </em>quoted <em>O\u2019Donnell\u2019s </em>syllabus.

The court instructed the jury that, if it found that the injury to plaintiffs property was caused by defendant\u2019s negligence, the damages should represent the difference between the market value of the house at the date of the injury and that value it would have had if the property had remained undamaged. This is the measure of recovery only where the injury is permanent. No instruction was given as to what the measure of damages should be in case the jury found the injuries were reparable, nor did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"245\">*245</page-number>defendant make any showing as to the cost of full restoration and repair of the house. Apparently, plaintiff tried the case on the theory that the damage was permanent and irreparable. Nevertheless, if defendant shows that the property can be repaired and restored to the condition it would have been in had it not been damaged by the subsidence, and also gives proper testimony as to the cost of the repairs, the court should make it clear to the jury that the question as to the permanency of the damage, and, if reparable, the cost of repairs, is one of fact for them to decide, if they conclude that defendant was responsible for the damages.

That is the case for <em>Sutter\u2019s </em>rule; that is, while <em>Sutter </em>provided an appropriate \u201cgeneral rule\u201d for tort actions generally, <em>O\u2019Donnell </em>provided an exception to that rule that has been specifically adapted to tort actions involving only property damage.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b514-8\"> Although <em>Sutter </em>was decided some years after <em>O\u2019Donnell, </em>the \u201cgeneral rules\u201d articulated in these cases have each been restated repeatedly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>over the years without conflict (until this case). This history underscores that the two \u201cgeneral rules\u201d here operate in parallel and are complementary.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b515-7\"> The Court of Appeals did not acknowledge <em>Valentine. </em>It addressed the <em>O\u2019Donnell </em>rule \u2014 by reference to <em>Strzelecki </em>and <em>Baranowski </em>\u2014 but determined that application of that rule to the instant case would be inappropriate because the cases in which that rule has been applied \u201caddressed the measure of damages for <em>economic </em>loss suffered as a result of the destruction of real property\u201d and did not include \u201ca discussion of noneconomic damages.\u201d <em>Price, </em>294 Mich App at 53. This ignores <em>Wolverine </em>(and Strzelecki\u2019s citation of <em>Wolverine), </em>which applied the <em>O\u2019Donnell </em>rule to damages for personal property. Moreover, in our judgment, the absence of discussion regarding noneconomic damages, as explained earlier in this opinion, supports, rather than undermines, our conclusion that noneconomic damages are not recoverable. Not only did both <em>Strzelecki </em>and <em>Baranowski </em>involve damage to houses, but one would think that decades-long restatements by the judiciary of this state that tort damage to property is recompensed by x + y would at some point logically communicate that z is not also included.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b515-8\"> Contrary to the analysis of the Court of Appeals in this case, <em>Koester, </em>244 Mich App at 176, explained that it was declining to create new tort liability:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b515-9\">In essence, plaintiff requests that we create for pet owners an independent cause of action for loss of companionship when a pet is negligently injured by a veterinarian.

Indeed, with the exception of <em>Daley v LaCroix, </em>384 Mich 4; 179 NW2d 390 (1970), none of the cases cited by the Court of Appeals involved property damage at all. <em>Sutter, </em>377 Mich at 83-84, and <em>McClain v Univ of Mich Bd of Regents, </em>256 Mich App 492, 493-494; 665 NW2d 484 (2003), both involved claims for bodily injury resulting from medical malpractice. <em>Phillips v Butterball Farms Co, Inc (After Second Remand), </em>448 Mich 239, 241-242; 531 NW2d 144 (1995), involved a claim for emotional distress resulting from a retaliatory discharge, and <em>Daley, </em>384 Mich at 13, involved a claim for emotional distress resulting from fright. Moreover, <em>Stevens v City of Flint, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued December 20, 2007 (Docket No. 272329), and <em>Bielat v South Macomb Disposal Auth, </em>unpublished opinion per curiam of the Court of Appeals, issued November 9, 2004 (Docket No. 249147) \u2014 the unpublished opinions the Court of Appeals cited as persuasive authority \u2014 both involved trespass-nuisance claims.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b516-7\"> The treatise cites the Court of Appeals\u2019 decision as the only exception to the <em>O\u2019Donnell </em>rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b516-8\">Note that the Michigan Court of Appeals has held that a plaintiff may seek recovery for noneconomic damages in a negligence action for mental anguish naturally flowing from the damage to or destruction of real property.

In this case, there is no statutory, judicial, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>other persuasive authority that compels or permits this Court to take the drastic action proposed by plaintiff. Case law on this issue from sister states is not consistent, persuasive, or sufficient precedent. We refuse to create a remedy where there is no legal structure in which to give it support. However, plaintiff and others are free to urge the Legislature to visit this issue in light of public policy considerations, including societal sentiment....</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"20\">\n<p id=\"b518-7\"> Although this Court is vested with the power to alter the common law, as already explained, such alteration should not be undertaken lightly. As counseled in <em>People v </em>Kevorkian, 447 Mich 436, 482 n 60; 527 NW2d 714 (1994) (opinion by Cavanagh, C.J., and Brickley and Griffin, JJ.), quoting Justice Cardozo\u2019s <em>The Nature of the Judicial Process:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b519-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>The judge, even when he is free, is still not wholly free. He is not to innovate at pleasure. He is not a knight-errant, roaming at will in pursuit of his own ideal of beauty or of goodness. He is to draw his inspiration from consecrated principles. He is not to yield to spasmodic sentiment, to vague and unregulated benevolence. He is to exercise a discretion informed by tradition, methodized by analogy, disciplined by system, and subordinated to the primordial necessity of order in the social life. Wide enough in all conscience is the field of discretion that remains. [Quotation marks and citations omitted.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">Thus, this Court does not alter the common law at its unchecked discretion, much less at its whim. Rather, we are bound to tradition and stability and continuity. By virtue of its overtly political and representative nature, the Legislature is bound by different considerations.
