Because we agree with the Court of Appeals that defendant was not subjected to such questioning after he invoked his right to remain silent, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals, which correctly reversed the trial court\u2019s decision to suppress defendant\u2019s voluntarily given confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-4\">I. FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">Defendant allegedly turned a drug buy into an armed robbery by pulling out a gun instead of proffering cash. He and the victim allegedly struggled over the gun, the gun went off, and the victim was killed. Defendant was then taken into custody. After a police officer read defendant his <em>Miranda </em>rights, the following colloquy, which was recorded on a DVD, immediately ensued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-6\"><em>[Officer}: </em>Okay. This is what they call the acknowledgement and waiver paragraph. I\u2019m going to read this to you. If you wish to talk to me, I\u2019m going to need you to sign and date [the] form. Even though you sign and date the form, you still have your rights to stop at any time you wish. Do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-8\"><em>[Defendant}: </em>No. No thank you sir. I\u2019m not going to sign it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-9\"><em>[Officer}: </em>Okay. Okay. Sounds good.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-10\"><em>[Defendant}: </em>I don\u2019t even want to speak.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-11\"><em>[Officer}: </em>I understand. I understand Kadeem. Okay then. The only thing I can tell you Kadeem, is good luck man. Okay. Don\u2019t take this personal. It\u2019s not personal between me and you, I think I may have had one contact with you on the street. Okay. I\u2019ve got to do my job. And I understand you\u2019ve got to do what you\u2019ve got to do to protect your best interests. Okay. The only thing that I can tell you is this, and I\u2019m not asking you questions, I\u2019m just telling you. I hope that the gun is in a place where nobody can get a hold of it and nobody else can get hurt by it, okay. All right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>[Defendant]: I didn\u2019t even mean for it to happen like that. It was a complete accident.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-5\">[Officer]: I understand. I understand. But like I said, you, uhh, you get your attorney, man. Hey, look dude, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re a monster, all right. I don\u2019t think that. You could have came down to me and turned yourself in and there ain\u2019t no damn way I\u2019d beat you up. Yeah. Okay, man? You all set, you straight with me? Who knows you\u2019re here? Who knows of your family? Because I know a lot of your family in town now.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-6\"><em>[Defendant]: </em>I know that I didn\u2019t mean to do it. I guarantee that, I know I didn\u2019t mean to do it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-7\"><em>[Officer]: </em>Does your dad know you\u2019re down here?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-8\"><em>[Defendant]: </em>Yeah.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">Defendant was charged with first-degree felony murder, MCL 750.316(1)(b), armed robbery, MCL 750.529, and possession of a firearm during the commission of a felony, MCL 750.227b. Before trial, defendant moved to suppress his statement to the police officer. The trial court granted defendant\u2019s motion, finding the officer\u2019s comment \u2014 \u201cI hope that the gun is in a place where nobody can get a hold of it and nobody else can get hurt by it\u201d \u2014 to be the functional equivalent of express questioning, which is prohibited after a defendant has invoked his right to remain silent. In a published, and split, decision, the Court of Appeals reversed. <em>People v White, 294 </em>Mich App 622; 823 NW2d 118 (2011). The majority held that the officer\u2019s comment did not constitute the functional equivalent of express questioning under Innis and thus that there was no constitutional violation. The dissent would have suppressed the confession because, with the word \u201cokay\u201d appended to his expression of concern regarding the firearm, the officer\u2019s comment constituted an express question. At the very least, the dissent concluded, the officer\u2019s comment constituted the functional equivalent of a question and was thus prohibited. This Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"193\">*193</page-number>granted defendant\u2019s application for leave to appeal. <em>People v White, </em>491 Mich 890 (2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Because the pertinent facts here are undisputed, we review de novo the trial court\u2019s decision regarding whether defendant was subjected to \u201cinterrogation\u201d or, more specifically, \u201cexpress questioning or its functional equivalent.\u201d <em>Innis, </em>446 US at 300-301. We agree with the Court of Appeals dissent that the majority erred by applying the \u201cclear error\u201d standard of review in evaluating whether such questioning occurred. As the dissent explained, given that the facts are undisputed, the de novo standard of review, not review for clear error, is applicable. See <em>People v Attebury, </em>463 Mich 662, 668; 624 NW2d 912 (2001) (\u201cTo the extent that a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress involves an interpretation of the law or the application of a constitutional standard to uncontested facts, our review is de novo.\u201d). However, this error was harmless because the majority held that \u201c[e]ven under a de novo review of the evidence,... we conclude, as did the trial court, that no express questioning occurred.\u201d <em>White, </em>294 Mich App at 633.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">The Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution provides that \u201c[n]o person shall... be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself. .. .\u201d US Const, Am V See also Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 17. Notwithstanding the apparent textual focus of the Fifth Amendment on whether a defendant\u2019s confession was undertaken voluntarily and without coercion,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"194\">*194</page-number>United States Supreme Court has held since <em>Miranda </em>that in the context of a \u201ccustodial interrogation,\u201d advising a defendant of his <em>Miranda </em>rights<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> is necessary to protect his constitutional privilege against self-incrimination, and \u201c[i]f the individual indicates in any manner, at any time prior to or during questioning, that he wishes to remain silent, the interrogation must cease.\u201d <em>Miranda, </em>384 US at 444, 473-474. If the police continue to \u201cinterrogate\u201d the defendant after he has invoked his right to remain silent, and the defendant confesses as a result of that \u201cinterrogation,\u201d the confession is inadmissible. <em>Id. </em>at 444-445. However, <em>Miranda </em>also clarified that voluntarily given confessions that are not the result of impermissible custodial interrogations remain admissible:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b452-6\">In dealing with statements obtained through interrogation, we do not purport to find all confessions inadmissible. Confessions remain a proper element in law enforcement. Any statement given freely and voluntarily without any compelling influences is, of course, admissible in evidence. The fundamental import of the privilege while an individual is in custody is not whether he is allowed to talk to the police without the benefit of warnings and counsel, but whether he can be interrogated. There is no requirement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"195\">*195</page-number>that police stop a person who enters a police station and states that he wishes to confess to a crime, or a person who calls the police to offer a confession or any other statement he desires to make. Volunteered statements of any kind are not barred by the Fifth Amendment and their admissibility is not affected by our holding today. <em>[Id. </em>at 478.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">In this case, there is no question that defendant was in \u201ccustody\u201d and that after defendant was read his <em>Miranda </em>rights, he invoked his right to remain silent. Thus, the question here is whether, after defendant invoked his right to remain silent, he was then subjected to \u201cinterrogation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">In <em>Innis, </em>446 US at 300-302, the United States Supreme Court explained the circumstances under which a defendant is deemed to have been subjected to \u201cinterrogation\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-7\">[T]he <em>Miranda </em>safeguards come into play whenever a person in custody is subjected to either express questioning or its functional equivalent. That is to say, the term \u201cinterrogation\u201d under <em>Miranda </em>refers not only to express questioning, but also to any words or actions on the part of the police (other than those normally attendant to arrest and custody) that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect. The latter portion of this definition focuses primarily upon the perceptions of the suspect, rather than the intent of the police. This focus reflects the fact that the <em>Miranda </em>safeguards were designed to vest a suspect in custody with an added measure of protection against coercive police practices, without regard to objective proof of the underlying intent of the police. A practice that the police should know is reasonably likely to evoke an incriminating response from a suspect thus amounts to interrogation. But, since the police surely cannot be held accountable for the unforeseeable results of their words or actions, the definition of interrogation can extend only to words or actions on the part of police officers that they <em>should have known </em>were reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response. [Emphasis in the original.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>The Court further explained, however, that the underlying intent of the police is not irrelevant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-6\">[I]t may well have a hearing on whether the police should have known that their words or actions were reasonably likely to evoke an incriminating response. In particular, where a police practice is designed to elicit an incriminating response from the accused, it is unlikely that the practice will not also be one which the police should have known was reasonably likely to have that effect. <em>[Id. </em>at 301 n 7.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">But again, as one academic commentator explained, the focus must be on the objective manifestation of the officer\u2019s words rather than on the officer\u2019s subjective intentions in speaking the words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-8\">[T]he best reading of the <em>Innis </em>test is that it turns upon the <em>objective </em>purpose <em>manifested </em>by the police. Thus, an officer \u201cshould know\u201d that his speech or conduct will be \u201creasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response\u201d when he should realize that the speech or conduct will probably be viewed by the suspect as designed to achieve this purpose. To ensure that the inquiry is entirely <em>objective, </em>the proposed test could be framed as follows: if an objective observer (with the same knowledge of the suspect as the police officer) would, on the sole basis of hearing the officer\u2019s remarks, infer that the remarks were designed to elicit an incriminating response, then the remarks should constitute \u201cinterrogation.\u201d [2 LaFave, Criminal Procedure (3d ed), \u00a7 6.7(a), p 757, quoting White, <em>Interrogation Without Questions: Rhode Island v. Innis and United States v. Henry, </em>78 Mich L R 1209, 1231-1232 (1980) (emphasis in the original).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">On the basis of the foregoing principle, <em>Innis </em>concluded that the defendant was not \u201cinterrogated\u201d within the meaning of <em>Miranda. </em>The defendant had been suspected of robbing and killing taxicab drivers with a sawed-off shotgun. When the police arrested him, they repeatedly read him his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>the defendant invoked his right to counsel. On the way to the police station, the defendant was in the backseat of a squad car accompanied by three officers. The officers were having a conversation and one of them stated that there were \u201ca lot of handicapped children running around in this area\u201d because a school for handicapped children was located nearby, and \u201cGod forbid one of them might find a weapon with shells and they might hurt themselves.\u201d <em>Innis, </em>446 US at 294-295. In the course of this conversation, the officers were interrupted by the defendant, who directed them to turn the squad car around so that he could show them where the gun was hidden.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">The Court held that the defendant had not been \u201cinterrogated\u201d in violation of <em>Miranda </em>because he was neither subjected to \u201cexpress questioning\u201d nor its \u201cfunctional equivalent.\u201d Regarding the latter, the Court noted that (1) \u201c[t]here is nothing in the record to suggest that the officers were aware that the respondent was peculiarly susceptible to an appeal to his conscience concerning the safety of handicapped children\u201d; (2) \u201c[n]or is there anything in the record to suggest that the police knew that the respondent was unusually disoriented or upset at the time of his arrest\u201d; (3) \u201cthe entire conversation appears to have consisted of no more than a few offhand remarks\u201d; (4) \u201c[t]his is not a case where the police carried on a lengthy harangue in the presence of the suspect\u201d; (5) \u201c[n]or does the record support the respondent\u2019s contention that, under the circumstances, the officers\u2019 comments were particularly \u2018evocative.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 302-303. Finally, the Court held that the lower court had \u201cerred ... in equating \u2018subtle compulsion\u2019 with interrogation\u201d because even when there is subtle compulsion, \u201c[i]t must also be established that a suspect\u2019s incriminating response was the product of words or actions on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>the part of the police that they should have known were reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 303.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">In the instant case, we agree with the Court of Appeals that defendant was not subjected to \u201cexpress questioning\u201d after he invoked his right to remain silent. First, a \u201cquestion\u201d asks for or invites a response. <em>Id. </em>at 302 (holding that the respondent was not subjected to \u201cexpress questioning\u201d because \u201cno response from the respondent was invited\u201d); <em>Random House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary </em>(2001) (defining \u201cquestion\u201d as \u201ca sentence in an interrogative form addressed to someone in order to get information in reply\u201d or \u201cthe act of asking or inquiring\u201d). The officer\u2019s comment in this case \u2014 \u201cI hope that the gun is in a place where nobody can get a hold of it and nobody else can get hurt by it\u201d \u2014 was not a question because it did not ask for an answer or invite a response. It was a mere expression of hope and concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">Second, the officer\u2019s addition of the words \u201cokay\u201d and \u201call right\u201d at the end of his comment did not transform a non-question into a question. This is especially obvious when the conversation is considered in its entirety, as it must be, because the officer <em>repeatedly </em>used the words \u201cokay\u201d and \u201call right\u201d in a manner that failed to garner any response from defendant. See <em>Acosta v Artuz, 575 </em>F3d 177, 191 (CA 2, 2009) <em>{\u201cInnis </em>calls upon courts to consider police conduct in light of the totality of the circumstances in assessing whether the police \u2018should have known\u2019 that their actions \u2018were reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.\u2019 \u201d), quoting <em>Innis, </em>446 US at 303. We agree with Justice CAVANAGH that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-7\">it is not unusual for people to use certain words or phrases repeatedly while speaking without intending for those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>words to have significant meaning. In fact, during the approximately five-minute-long colloquy between Stiles and defendant, Stiles repeatedly used the phrases \u201cokay\u201d and \u201call right\u201d to punctuate statements, apparently without intending to extract a response from defendant. <em>[Post </em>at 212-213.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">Indeed, the officer used the word \u201cokay\u201d 17 times during the 5-minute conversation, and yet defendant only \u201cresponded\u201d 3 times, including the \u201cresponse\u201d that is at issue in this case, and the other 2 \u201cresponses\u201d \u2014 if that is even a proper characterization of what defendant\u2019s statements amounted to \u2014 were simply \u201cyeah\u201d and \u201cokay.\u201d Similarly, the officer used the phrase \u201call right\u201d 4 times during the 5-minute conversation and only in this one instance did defendant again \u201crespond,\u201d and, as discussed later in this opinion, that \u201cresponse\u201d was in no way responsive to the officer\u2019s statement because defendant said nothing about the gun \u2014 the very matter that had been the subject of the officer\u2019s statement. Moreover, from our own review of the video of the interview, the officer\u2019s comment, at least in our judgment, does not at all <em>sound </em>like a question. That is, the officer did not say the words \u201cokay\u201d and \u201call right\u201d in a manner and with an emphasis that would have made a reasonable person believe that a response was expected. Instead, the use of these words reflected essentially a verbal tic on the officer\u2019s part meaning, \u201cOkay, all right, I have finished my thought.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">Furthermore, immediately before the officer made the statement at issue, he said, \u201cI\u2019m not asking you questions, I\u2019m just telling you.\u201d Although this is certainly not dispositive of whether what follows constituted a \u201cquestion,\u201d it is nevertheless relevant with regard to whether the officer reasonably should have expected an answer. The very utterance itself made it less likely either that the officer would have reasonably <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>expected defendant to answer with an incriminating response <em>or </em>that defendant would have proffered an incriminating response.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Moreover, as previously noted, the fact that defendant\u2019s \u201cresponse\u201d to the officer\u2019s comment concerning the location of the gun did not have anything at all to do with the location of the gun also reinforces the conclusion that the officer\u2019s comment here was not a question. If it was a question, defendant certainly did not answer it. Instead, defendant said: \u201cI didn\u2019t even mean for it to happen like that. It was a complete accident.\u201d If defendant was answering the <em>officer\u2019s </em>\u201cquestion,\u201d one would think that he would have said something about the location of the gun, but he did not, and this, in our judgment, underscores that the officer\u2019s comment was not a question to begin with.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">In addition, the fact that the officer responded to defendant\u2019s incriminating statement by saying, \u201c[Y]ou, uhh, you get your attorney, man,\u201d and then asking defendant if his family knew that he was there, suggests that the officer was not expecting or trying to obtain an incriminating response from defendant. Instead, it seems that the officer was taken somewhat by surprise by defendant\u2019s incriminating statement, and he immediately sought to veer the conversation away from any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>further incriminating statements. The fact that the officer was caught off guard by defendant\u2019s incriminating statement further underscores that the officer\u2019s comment was not \u201cdesigned to elicit an incriminating response . . . .\u201d <em>Innis, </em>446 US at 302 n 7.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Finally, to the extent that the officer\u2019s statement can even be reasonably viewed as a question, this particular question does not seem intended to generate an incriminating response.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Instead, if anything, the officer was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>simply trying to ensure that defendant heard and understood him. As the Court of Appeals explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b460-5\">[W]e conclude, as did the trial court, that no express questioning occurred. After defendant invoked his right to remain silent, the detective informed defendant that he was not asking any more questions and was only going to make a statement. The brief statement was made, and though the detective stated \u201cokay\u201d and \u201calright\u201d after the statement, the video makes clear that in context the detective was seeking affirmation that defendant heard the statement, not that he was seeking a response to the statement. And the detective\u2019s response once defendant blurted out an incriminating statement shows he had not intended that there be any sort of substantive response to the statement. Consequently, there was no express questioning of defendant. <em>[White, </em>294 Mich App at 633-634.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">We further agree with the Court of Appeals that defendant was not subjected to the \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d of express questioning after he invoked his right to remain silent. Just as in <em>Innis, </em>there is nothing in the record to suggest that the officer was aware that defendant was \u201cpeculiarly susceptible to an appeal to his conscience\u201d concerning the safety of others. <em>Innis, </em>446 US at 302. Justice CAVANAGH asserts that the officer\u2019s comment about the gun \u201cplayed to the likelihood that defendant would respond to an <em>expression of concern for the safety of others.\u201d Post </em>at 225 (emphasis added). However, we have a difficult time fathoming that the officer believed that defendant was \u201cpeculiarly susceptible to an appeal to his conscience,\u201d especially where defendant had just been arrested for shooting another man to death for drugs. That is, under these circumstances, and absent any evidence of defendant\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>peculiar susceptibility, we are not persuaded that the officer here should have known that \u201cdefendant would perceive the [officer\u2019s] comments as compelling a response in order to protect others . . . <em>Post </em>at 227.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Although Justice CAVANAGH states that \u201cseveral of defendant\u2019s individual personal characteristics increased the likelihood that he would perceive Stiles\u2019s comments as requiring a response,\u201d <em>post </em>at 229, he only articulates two such characteristics: \u201cdefendant\u2019s youth and inexperience with the criminal justice system, <em>\u201d post </em>at 228-229. However, the mere fact that defendant was 17 years old and inexperienced in the criminal justice system does not mean that he was \u201cpeculiarly susceptible to an appeal to his conscience\u201d or \u201cunusual[ly] susceptible] ... to a particular form of persuasion . . . .\u201d <em>Innis, </em>446 US 302.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Indeed, not even defendant himself has argued that he possesses any personal characteristics that made it more likely that he would feel compelled to respond to the officer\u2019s comment about the gun. And indeed, as previously discussed, defendant never did truly \u201crespond\u201d to the officer\u2019s comment about the gun \u2014 he never told the officer where the gun was.

Furthermore, the officer only made a single remark about the gun. \u201cThis is not a case where the police carried on a lengthy harangue in the presence of the suspect.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Nor was the officer\u2019s remark \u201cparticularly \u2018evocative.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Indeed, the officer\u2019s comment in the instant case was far less \u201cevocative\u201d than the officer\u2019s comment in <em>Innis. </em>In <em>Innis, </em>the officer said, \u201c[Tjhere\u2019s a lot of handicapped children running around in this area, and God forbid one of them might find a weapon with shells and they might hurt themselves.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 294-295.

For example, in <em>Fleming v Metrish, </em>556 F3d 520, 523 (CA 6, 2009), when an officer told the suspect after the suspect had invoked his right to remain silent that \u201cthings did not look good for him and that \u2018maybe he needed to do the right thing\u2019 \u201d and asked the suspect if he now wanted to talk to the lead detective, the court held that this did not constitute \u201cinterrogation.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>court specifically rejected that there was a significant distinction between the officers\u2019 conversation in <em>Innis </em>and the comments directed to the defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-5\">We recognize that <em>Innis </em>is arguably distinguishable on the basis that the conversation in <em>Innis </em>occurred between two police officers, and was not directed toward the suspect himself. Officer Clayton\u2019s brief remarks were, in contrast, clearly aimed at Fleming. Such a distinction might be significant if an officer\u2019s brief remarks morphed into, for example, a \u201clengthy harangue\u201d because, other things being equal, extended comments directed toward a suspect are more likely to elicit an incriminating response. But this court has previously rejected a constitutional challenge to cursory comments aimed at a suspect in an analogous context. See <em>United States v. Hurst, </em>228 F.3d 751, 760 (6th Cir.2000) (holding that \u201cthe mere statement by [a law-enforcement official] that \u2018we\u2019ve got good information on you,\u2019 viewed in context, contains no compulsive element suggesting a Fifth Amendment violation under the circumstances.\u201d). <em>[Id. </em>at 527 (alteration in the original).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">Indeed, \u201ccourts have generally rejected claims . . . that disclosure of the results of a lineup or other inculpatory evidence possessed by the police, without more, constitutes \u2018interrogation\u2019 under <em>Innis.\u201d Acosta, </em>575 F3d at 191. See, for example, <em>Easley v Frey, </em>433 F3d 969, 974 (CA 7, 2006) (holding that informing the defendant that an eyewitness was willing to testify against him and that if convicted he could be subject to the death penalty did not constitute \u201cinterrogation\u201d); <em>United States v Payne, </em>954 F2d 199, 203 (CA 4, 1992) (holding that informing the defendant that a gun was found at his home did not constitute \u201cinterrogation\u201d); <em>Shedelbower v Estelle, </em>885 F2d 570, 572-573 (CA 9, 1989) (holding that informing the defendant that his accomplice had been arrested and that the victim had identified him as one of her assailants after being shown his photograph did not constitute \u201cinterrogation\u201d); <em>People v McCuaig, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>126 Mich App 754, 760; 338 NW2d 4 (1983) (holding that \u201cthe statements made by the police officer, which merely advised defendant of the crime with which he was charged and which described the events which led to that charge, cannot be characterized as further interrogation by the officer or its functional equivalent\u201d); <em>People v Kowalski, </em>230 Mich App 464, 467-469, 483; 584 NW2d 613 (1998) (holding that informing the defendant that his accomplice had given a statement and inquiring whether the defendant still wanted an attorney did not constitute \u201cinterrogation\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">Accordingly, direct statements to the defendant do not necessarily constitute \u201cinterrogation.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Again, the dispositive question is whether the \u201csuspect\u2019s incriminating response was the product of words or actions on the part of the police that they should have known were reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.\u201d <em>Innis, </em>446 US at 303. And for the reasons set forth, we do not believe that defendant\u2019s incriminating response in this case can be characterized as such a product. As the Court of Appeals explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b466-6\">[NJothing in the record suggests that the detective was aware of any peculiar susceptibility of defendant (or that he even had any). So, focusing on what defendant would have perceived from the statement in its context, we can only conclude that Detective Stiles should not have reasonably expected defendant to make an incriminating statement. After all, Detective Stiles had already told defendant both that he was not asking a question and that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>understood defendant\u2019s invocation of his right to remain silent. Amidst these other permissible comments \u2014 and absent any known sensitivities of defendant \u2014 it would not be reasonable to conclude that the one comment about the possibility of the gun being located and endangering others would result in a statement about the crime itself. Just as importantly, this \u201cis not a case where the police carried on a lengthy harangue in the presence of\u201d defendant, nor was Detective Stiles\u2019s comment \u201cevocative.\u201d <em>Innis, </em>446 US at 302-303. And these latter two points make any distinction between a direct remark made to defendant and a defendant overhearing remarks between police as in <em>Innis </em>insufficient to come to a different constitutional conclusion. <em>[White, </em>294 Mich App at 632.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b467-4\">IV CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">For these reasons, we agree with the Court of Appeals that defendant was not \u201cinterrogated\u201d in violation of <em>Miranda. </em>Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals, which reversed the trial court\u2019s decision to suppress defendant\u2019s voluntarily given confession.

However, perhaps the officer was simply <em>genuinely </em>concerned about somebody getting hold of the gun and injuring either themselves or somebody else. Just as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b459-8\">\u201cin <em>Innis, </em>there is a basis for concluding that the officer\u2019s remarks were made for some purpose <em>other </em>than that of obtaining evidence from the suspect\u201d because an \u201cobjective listener could plausibly conclude that the policemen\u2019s remarks in <em>Innis </em>were made solely to express their genuine concern about the danger posed by the hidden shotgun.\u201d [2 LaFave at 757 n 20, quoting White, 78 Mich L R at 1234-1235 (emphasis in the original).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">See also <em>Innis, </em>446 US at 303 n 9 (\u201c [I]t was \u2018entirely understandable that [the officers] would voice their concern [for the safety of the handicapped children] to each other.\u201d) (alterations in the original). Furthermore, given that after the officer said something about the gun, he asked defendant if his family knew where he was, perhaps the officer was hoping that defendant might tell a family member where the gun was if it was not in a safe location so that a family member could ensure that the gun was moved to a safe location. Finally, \u201cthe mere fact that a police officer may he aware that there is a \u2018possibility\u2019 that a suspect may make an incriminating statement is insufficient to establish the functional equivalent of interrogation.\u201d <em>United States v Taylor, </em>985 F2d 3, 8 (CA 1, 1993), citing <em>Arizona v Mauro, </em>481 US 520, 528-529; 107 S Ct 1931; 95 L Ed 2d 458 (1987) (\u201cOfficers do not interrogate a suspect simply by hoping that he will incriminate himself.\u201d). Contrary to Justice Cavanagh\u2019s intimation, we fully recognize that the officer\u2019s subjective intent is not dispositive. However, as <em>Innis, </em>446 US at 301 n 7, explained, such intent is not \u201cirrelevant\u201d either, and it is especially not \u201cirrelevant\u201d when a</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b461-6\"> In the case relied on heavily by Justice Mary Beth <em>Kelly </em>\u2014 JDB <em>v North Carolina, </em>564 US_; 131 S Ct 2394, 2398, 2406; 180 L Ed 2d 310 (2011), which, unlike the instant case, involved a 13-year-old boy \u2014 the United States Supreme Court held that although \u201cthe age of a child subjected to police questioning is relevant to the custody analysis of <em>Miranda,\u201d </em>\u201c[tjhis is not to say that a child\u2019s age will be a determinative, or even a significant, factor in every case.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b461-9\"> Justice Kelly contends that we focus exclusively on the officer\u2019s comment about the gun and ignore his \u201creferences to violence and attempts to earn defendant\u2019s trust through expressions of understanding and references to defendant\u2019s family.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 235 n 20.

Accordingly, the officer\u2019s statement is probably better understood as a reference to <em>nonviolence </em>than to violence. And while it is true that the officer did refer to defendant\u2019s family and did render expressions of understanding, we hardly believe that these statements transformed a non-interrogation into an interrogation. Nor do we do not believe that police officers violate the United States Constitution by rendering expressions of understanding to suspects or by inquiring as to whether their families are aware that they are in custody.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b462-7\"> Contrary to Justice Cavanagh\u2019s contention, <em>Mauro </em>did not hold that subjecting a suspect to \u201cpsychological ploys\u201d constitutes \u201cinterrogation.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 223-224. <em>Mauro </em>simply noted that the defendant in that case had <em>not </em>been subjected to \u201cpsychological ploys.\u201d <em>Mauro, </em>481 US at 529.

However, the record is equally devoid of any contrary subjective intent, and why should an officer of the law expressing concern about the risk to others being posed by an abandoned firearm be presumed to be engaged in a \u201cpsychological ploy\u201d? Why can\u2019t it be presumed, absent more, that the expression of such a concern is sincere and genuine and an altogether legitimate aspect of the officer\u2019s professional responsibilities? Indeed, it is difficult to imagine a more legitimate concern that an officer of the law might express.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b463-13\"> Justice Cavanagh relies heavily on <em>In re EG, </em>482 A2d 1243 (DC, 1984), for the proposition that whether the officer was talking directly to the defendant is a significant factor. In <em>In re EG, </em>the officer was told that a man wearing a beige hat and dark sunglasses had just committed an armed robbery. When the officer stopped the defendant and found a beige hat and dark sunglasses in the defendant\u2019s pocket, the officer said: \u201cHere is the sunglasses and the hat. I wonder where the gun and money is [sic].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1245. The defendant responded, \u201cI gave it to my partner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The District of Columbia Court of Appeals held that the officer\u2019s statement constituted \u201cinterrogation\u201d because \u201cthere was no understandable explanation for [the officer\u2019s] rhetorical question other than to elicit a response from appellant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1248. In the instant case, however, as previously discussed, there is a reasonable explanation for the officer\u2019s comment other than to elicit an incriminatory response from defendant \u2014 a genuine and legitimate concern about the danger posed by the missing gun. <em>In re EG </em>is also distinguishable from the instant case because in that case, the defendant was never told that he had a right to remain silent, while in the instant case defendant was informed that he had a right to remain silent, he invoked that right, and before the officer made the comment about the gun he specifically told defendant that it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>was a statement, not a question. Finally, in <em>In re EG, </em>the officer made the comment while his service revolver was drawn and the defendant had his hands on the roof of the officer\u2019s police cruiser, while here the officer made the comment during a completely civil conversation with defendant at the police station. Therefore, not only is <em>In re EG, </em>of course, not binding on this Court, but it is also distinguishable on significant grounds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b464-13\"> Contrary to Justice Cavanagh\u2019s contention, we do not \u201cfail[] to give proper consideration to the <em>context </em>in which the statements were made.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 218 (emphasis in the original). Instead, we <em>are </em>fully cognizant that the officer\u2019s comments at issue here were made in a distinct context from those at issue in <em>Innis, </em>because while the officer in <em>Innis </em>was speaking to another officer, the officer here was speaking to the defendant himself. However, this appears to be the only contextual difference relied on by Justice Cavanagh (other than that the defendant in <em>Innis </em>was in a police car, while the defendant here was in a police interrogation room, which we believe is a distinction without a meaningful difference), and for the reasons explained above, we do not believe that this distinction by itself, although certainly a distinction, compels a different result. And contrary to Justice Cavanagh\u2019s intimation, the fact that two of the <em>dissenting </em>justices in <em>Innis </em>opined that the officers\u2019 \u201cremarks \u2018would obviously have constituted interrogation if they had been explicitly directed to respondent\u2019 \u201d is of little relevance because they were <em>dissenting.

This case raises the issue of whether defendant, who was 17 years old at the time, was subjected to \u201cinterrogation\u201d after invoking his Fifth Amendment right against compelled self-incrimination, contrary to <em>Miranda v Arizona, </em>384 US 436; 86 S Ct 1602; 16 L Ed 2d 694 (1966). In my view, defendant was improperly subjected to the \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d of interrogation under <em>Rhode Island v Innis, </em>446 US 291; 100 S Ct 1682; 64 L Ed 2d 297 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>(1980); thus, I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals, reinstate the trial court\u2019s order suppressing defendant\u2019s incriminating statements, and remand this case to the trial court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-4\">The United States and Michigan Constitutions guarantee the right against compelled self-incrimination. US Const, Am V; Const 1963, art 1, \u00a7 17. The United States Supreme Court has explained that \u201cthe prosecution may not use statements, whether exculpatory or inculpatory, stemming from custodial interrogation of the defendant unless it demonstrates the use of procedural safeguards effective to secure the privilege against self-incrimination.\u201d <em>Miranda, </em>384 US at 444. The necessary \u201cprocedural safeguards\u201d are embodied in the now familiar <em>Miranda </em>warnings. <em>Innis, </em>446 US at 297; <em>Colorado v Spring, </em>479 US 564, 572; 107 S Ct 851; 93 L Ed 2d 954 (1987). The United States Supreme Court has \u201cconsistently . . . accorded a liberal construction\u201d to the privilege against self-incrimination, <em>Miranda, </em>384 US at 461, while still recognizing that \u201c[cjonfessions remain a proper element in law enforcement\u201d and \u201c[vjolunteered statements of any kind are not barred by the Fifth Amendment,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 478. Indeed, not all statements obtained by the police after a person has been taken into custody are automatically considered the product of interrogation. <em>Innis, </em>446 US at 299. Rather, interrogation \u201cmust reflect a measure of compulsion above and beyond that inherent in custody itself.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 300. However, if at any time \u201cthe individual indicates in any manner. . . that he wishes to remain silent, the interrogation must cease.\u201d <em>Miranda, </em>384 US at 473-474.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">In this case, it is undisputed that defendant was in custody, was given <em>Miranda </em>warnings, and had invoked <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>his right to remain silent before he made incriminating statements. Thus, the primary issue in this case is whether defendant was subjected to custodial interrogation after invoking his right to remain silent. The United States Supreme Court has explained that interrogation includes \u201cquestioning initiated by law enforcement officers after a person has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 444; see, also, <em>Yarborough v Alvarado, </em>541 US 652, 661; 124 S Ct 2140; 158 L Ed 2d 938 (2004), but, in subsequent opinions, the Court has further explained that \u201cinterrogation\u201d is not limited only to express questioning. Rather, certain \u201ctechniques of persuasion\u201d may also amount to interrogation. <em>Innis, </em>446 US at 299. Accordingly, \u201cinterrogation\u201d includes either \u201cexpress questioning or its functional equivalent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 300-301.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-4\">Although caselaw provides little guidance regarding how to determine whether specific statements by the police amount to express questioning, <em>Innis </em>explained that if a police officer\u2019s statement does not invite a response from the suspect, the statement does not amount to express questioning. <em>Id. </em>at 302. Although a communication asking someone for an answer obviously amounts to express questioning because it is a clear example of a remark that invites a response, <em>Innis </em>should not be interpreted to mean that only explicit or direct questions can amount to express questioning because other types of statements may also invite a response. Accordingly, police officers cannot remove their comments from the realm of express questioning merely by prefacing the comments with limiting phrases such as \u201cI\u2019m not asking you questions\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m just telling you,\u201d as Detective Brett Stiles did in this case. Although such qualifying statements might, in some situations, be relevant to a court\u2019s consideration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>of the totality of the circumstances, in my view merely prefacing a statement with \u201cI\u2019m not asking a question,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m just telling you,\u201d or other similar phrases should not be given significant weight because such statements do not magically transform what would otherwise be an express question into a constitutionally benign comment. For example, the statement \u201cI\u2019m not asking you a question, I\u2019m just telling you I want to know why you killed those people\u201d would clearly be an express question under <em>Miranda </em>and <em>Innis </em>because it invites a response, regardless of the interrogator\u2019s use of a lead-in statement. See <em>Innis, </em>446 US at 302.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-4\">Turning to the unique details of the statements at issue in this case, several characteristics of Stiles\u2019s statements indicate that he was asking an express question of defendant. First, defendant and Stiles were the only two people in the interrogation room when Stiles made the statements. Thus, Stiles was obviously directing his statements to defendant. Second, when considered in context, the phrases \u201cokay\u201d and \u201call right\u201d seem to invite defendant to respond by, at a minimum, acknowledging that he heard what Stiles had said. Third, after punctuating his statements with \u201cokay,\u201d Stiles paused for several seconds, as if waiting for a response from defendant. When defendant did not respond, Stiles followed up by stating, \u201cAll right?\u201d which, again, could be interpreted as inviting a response from defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">On the other hand, I agree with the majority that other characteristics of Stiles\u2019s statements weigh against the conclusion that the statements amounted to express questioning. Most notably, it is not unusual for people to use certain words or phrases repeatedly while speaking without intending for those words to have significant meaning. In fact, during the approximately <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>five-minute-long colloquy between Stiles and defendant, Stiles repeatedly used the phrases \u201cokay\u201d and \u201call right\u201d to punctuate statements, apparently without intending to extract a response from defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">As the preceding discussion reveals, the totality of the circumstances surrounding Stiles\u2019s statements allows for persuasive arguments in support of differing conclusions regarding whether Stiles subjected defendant to express questioning. However, I will assume arguendo, for purposes of this appeal only, that defendant was not subjected to express questioning because I believe that even if Stiles\u2019s comments were not \u201cexpress questions,\u201d the comments nevertheless amounted to the \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d of express questioning for the reasons discussed later in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">The \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d of express questioning encompasses \u201cany words or actions on the part of the police (other than those normally attendant to arrest and custody) that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect.\u201d <em>Innis, </em>446 US at 301. An \u201cincriminating response\u201d is \u201cany response \u2014 whether inculpatory or exculpatory \u2014 that the <em>prosecution </em>may seek to introduce at trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 301 n 5. <em>Innis </em>further explained that the requirement that the words or action be reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b471-6\">focuses primarily upon the perceptions of the suspect, rather than the intent of the police. This focus reflects the fact that the <em>Miranda </em>safeguards were designed to vest a suspect in custody with an added measure of protection against coercive police practices, without regard to objective proof of the underlying intent of the police. A practice that the police should know is reasonably likely to evoke an incriminating response from a suspect thus amounts to interrogation. <em>[Id. </em>at 301.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b472-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>However, the police \u201ccannot be held accountable for the unforeseeable results of their words or actions . ..</p>\n<p id=\"b472-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 302. Accordingly, \u201cthe definition of interrogation can extend only to words or actions on the part of police officers that they <em>should have known </em>were reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">The <em>Innis </em>Court made two additional important points regarding the definition of \u201cinterrogation.\u201d First, the Court stated that although the suspect\u2019s perception is the primary focus of the inquiry, the intent of the police is also relevant because \u201cit may well have a bearing on whether the police should have known that their words or actions were reasonably likely to evoke an incriminating response.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 301 n 7. Indeed, \u201cwhere a police practice is designed to elicit an incriminating response from the accused, it is unlikely that the practice will not also be one which the police should have known was reasonably likely to have that effect.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">Second, in determining whether the police should have known that their words or actions were reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response, \u201c[a]ny knowledge the police may have had concerning the unusual susceptibility of a defendant to a particular form of persuasion might be an important factor. . . .\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 302 n 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">Several opinions provide some examples that assist in establishing the boundaries of \u201cinterrogation\u201d under the \u201cfunctional equivalent\u201d analysis for <em>Miranda </em>purposes. For example, in <em>United States v Payne, </em>954 F2d 199, 202 (CA 4, 1992), the court concluded that \u201cmere declaratory descriptions of incriminating evidence do not invariably constitute interrogation for <em>Miranda </em>purposes.\u201d Likewise, <em>Acosta v Artuz, </em>575 F3d 177, 191-192 (CA 2, 2009), cited several cases supporting the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>premise that, generally, disclosure of the results of a lineup or other inculpatory evidence possessed by the police, without more, does not constitute interrogation under <em>Innis. </em>See, also, <em>United States v Moreno-Flores, </em>33 F3d 1164, 1169 (CA 9, 1994) (holding that the defendant was not interrogated when police informed him that drugs had been seized and that he \u201cwas in serious trouble\u201d), <em>People v McCuaig, </em>126 Mich App 754, 760; 338 NW2d 4 (1983) (finding no interrogation when an officer advised the defendant of the charges he was facing and described the events that resulted in the charge), and <em>Fleming v Metrish, </em>556 F3d 520, 533 (CA 6, 2009) (permitting comments explaining the inculpatory evidence possessed by the police so that the suspect could \u201creassess his situation\u201d and \u201cmake informed and intelligent assessments of [his] interests\u201d) (quotation marks and citation omitted) (alteration in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\">The common thread running through these cases is that the police generally do not interrogate a suspect for purposes of <em>Miranda </em>if the comments merely provide the suspect with additional information about the course of the investigation and allow the suspect to reconsider his or her decision to invoke the right to remain silent. I agree with the majority that these cases are helpful to the extent that they show that some limited communication with the suspect regarding the case after the invocation of the Fifth Amendment right to remain silent may be permissible under <em>Miranda. </em>However, the general principle established by these cases does not, alone, resolve this case because Stiles\u2019s expression of concern regarding the gun\u2019s location \u201cdid not provide defendant with information about the charges against him, about inculpatory evidence the police possessed, or about witness statements.\u201d <em>White, </em>294 Mich App at 638 n 5 (SHAPIRO, J., dissenting). Nor did his comments \u201coffer any new information that could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>provide a basis for an intelligent reassessment of the defendant\u2019s decision to remain silent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, applying this line of cases to conclude that Stiles\u2019s comments were not the functional equivalent of interrogation would erroneously expand the analysis beyond its intended scope of applicability.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">Although Stiles\u2019s comments do not fall into the categories of statements that are generally outside the scope of interrogation, I agree with the majority that this fact alone is not sufficient to label the comments \u201cinterrogation\u201d under <em>Innis. </em>Rather, it is necessary to consider the <em>Innis </em>definition of \u201cinterrogation\u201d in greater detail. Particularly important to deciding this case is (1) whether Stiles should have known that his comments were reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from defendant and (2) how defendant perceived the comments, regardless of Stiles\u2019s intent. See <em>Innis, </em>446 US at 301; see, also, <em>Stewart v United States, </em>668 A2d 857, 866 (DC, 1995) (explaining that applying <em>Innis </em>requires a court to \u201clook[] at the facts from the point of view of what the police should have known would be the impact of the statements and, most importantly, how the suspect perceived them\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">The defendant in <em>Innis </em>was suspected of a murder committed with a gun, which had not been recovered. The defendant, who was under arrest and had been given <em>Miranda </em>warnings, was riding in a police car with three officers when one officer commented to another officer that there were many handicapped children in the area where the defendant was arrested. The officer further commented that he hoped that none of the children found the gun and hurt themselves. The second officer expressed his agreement. The defendant overheard the officers\u2019 conversation and told the officers to turn the car around so that he could lead them to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>the gun. The Court concluded that the officers\u2019 conversation did not amount to the functional equivalent of interrogation, explaining that the officers\u2019 comments occurred in the context of a \u201cbrief conversation\u201d that \u201cconsisted of no more than a few offhand remarks.\u201d <em>Innis, </em>446 US at 303. The <em>Innis </em>Court also noted that the officers\u2019 comments did not constitute a \u201clengthy harangue in the presence of the suspect,\u201d nor were the comments \u201cparticularly \u2018evocative.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, <em>Innis </em>held that the suspect \u201cwas not subjected by the police to words or actions that the police should have known were reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from him.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b475-4\">In this case, the majority relies on its conclusion that the content of Stiles\u2019s comments was similar to the content of the officers\u2019 conversation in <em>Innis </em>to support reversing the trial court\u2019s suppression of defendant\u2019s incriminating statements. The majority emphasizes that, in <em>Innis </em>and in this case, the officers expressed concern regarding the whereabouts of a gun and the potential danger that it posed to others, and it notes that neither <em>Innis </em>nor this case presents a situation in which the officers engaged in a \u201clengthy harangue.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">While the majority is correct that there are some similarities between the officers\u2019 statements in <em>Innis </em>and Stiles\u2019s comments in this case, those similarities are not determinative. Rather, those similarities are only some of the facts that must be considered in order to determine how defendant perceived Stiles\u2019s statements and whether Stiles should have known that his comments were reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response. See <em>United States v Allen, </em>247 F3d 741, 765 (CA 8, 2001) (\u201cDetermining whether particular statements or practices amount to interrogation depends on the circumstances of each case, particularly <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>whether the statements are objectively and reasonably likely to result in incriminating responses by the suspect, as well as the nature of the police statements and the context in which they are given.\u201d), vacated on other grounds 536 US 953 (2002). Thus, the mere fact that the statements have some similar content is not determinative: <em>all </em>the circumstances <em>of </em>each case must be considered when applying the principles enunciated in <em>Innis.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">The majority\u2019s singular focus on the similarities in the <em>content of </em>the statements in Innis and this case fails to give proper consideration to the <em>context </em>in which the statements were made. And, in failing to consider the import of the context in which Stiles made the statements at issue, the majority all but ignores the primary considerations of the <em>Innis </em>case: the suspect\u2019s perception of the officer\u2019s statements and whether the officer should have known that his comments were reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response. Specifically, it is critical to recognize that, unlike the comments in <em>Innis, </em>Stiles\u2019s comments were made in a police interrogation room and were expressly directed to defendant, who was the only other person present when the statements were made. See <em>Allen, </em>247 F3d at 765 (emphasizing the context in which the statements are made). This factor is significant in determining whether Stiles should have reasonably expected that defendant would make an incriminating response. Indeed, in <em>In re EG, </em>482 A2d 1243, 1245 (DC, 1984), the court considered a situation in which an officer who was investigating an armed robbery arrested the defendant and, when no other officers were present, stated, \u201cI wonder where the gun and money is.\u201d <em>In re EG </em>compared the officer\u2019s statements to the officers\u2019 statements in <em>Innis </em>and concluded \u201cwithout reservation that [the officer] should have known that his statement was reasonably likely to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>elicit an incriminating response <em>. Id. </em>at 1248. <em>In re EG </em>differentiated the officer\u2019s statements from the <em>Innis </em>officers\u2019 statements by noting that \u201cno other person was present\u201d and that \u201cthere was no understandable explanation for [the officer\u2019s] rhetorical question other than to elicit a response from [the suspect].\u201d <em>Id. In re EG </em>reached this conclusion despite the officer\u2019s testimony that he did not expect a response to his statement, explaining that \u201cthe definition of interrogation \u2018focuses primarily upon the perceptions of the suspect, rather than the intent of the police.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1248 n 6, quoting <em>Innis, </em>446 US at 301. Accordingly, regardless of whether Stiles subjectively expected defendant to respond to his comments, defendant could have reasonably perceived that, given the content and context of the comments, Stiles was seeking a response.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-4\">Similarly, two of the dissenting justices in <em>Innis, </em>who were \u201csubstantially in agreement with the Court\u2019s definition of \u2018interrogation,\u2019 \u201d <em>Innis, </em>446 US at 305 (Marshall, J., dissenting), concluded that the <em>Innis </em>officers\u2019 remarks \u201cwould obviously have constituted interrogation if they had been explicitly directed to respondent,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 306.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This is true because the difference between overhearing a conversation and being the intended recipient of a comment is significant. Specifically, one who overhears a conversation in which he or she is not involved is unlikely to perceive that conversation as seeking his or her input. Conversely, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>when a comment is expressly directed at someone, the person to whom the comment is directed is reasonably likely to perceive that comment as seeking a response. Conversation does not, however, necessarily require that each participant in the conversation pose an explicit question in order for a response to be reasonably expected.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-6\">Rather than considering how the context affected defendant\u2019s perception of Stiles\u2019s statements and whether Stiles should have known that his comments were reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response, the majority prefers to speculate regarding Stiles\u2019s subjective intent in making the statements and concludes that the statements merely reflected a \u201cconcern about the danger posed by the missing gun.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 205 n 8. See, also, <em>ante </em>at 201 n 4 (speculating that Stiles intended for his comments to spur defendant to inform defendant\u2019s family of the gun\u2019s whereabouts).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The majority\u2019s analysis, however, fails to give proper weight to the primary principles of law established in <em>Innis: </em>\u201cthe <em>Miranda </em>safeguards were designed to vest a suspect in custody with an added measure of protection against coercive police practices, <em>without regard to objective proof of the underlying intent of the police.\u201d Innis, </em>446 US at 301 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b479-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>Likewise, the majority engages in a monumental effort to minimize the coercive atmosphere that defendant faced. For example, in attempting to distinguish this case from <em>In re EG, </em>the majority speculates that Stiles made the statements at issue out of \u201ca genuine and legitimate concern about the danger posed by the missing gun,\u201d whereas the officer in <em>In re EG </em>had no similar motive for his statements. <em>Ante </em>at 205 n 8. However, the officer in <em>In re EG </em>was in the process of arresting a person who was suspected of using a gun to commit a crime <em>with a partner. </em>Because the officer in <em>In re EG </em>did not immediately find a gun, it was possible that the defendant\u2019s partner had the gun and the officer\u2019s personal safety was in immediate danger. Thus, the officer arguably had an even more pressing and objectively verifiable \u201cconcern about the danger posed by the missing gun\u201d than did Stiles. Nevertheless, <em>In re EG </em>held that the officer\u2019s statements amounted to interrogation under <em>Innis. </em>Accordingly, I find unpersuasive the majority\u2019s attempt to distinguish <em>In re EG </em>on this basis.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b479-4\">More importantly, however, the majority\u2019s parsing of the factual circumstances to distinguish <em>In re EG </em>from this case is irrelevant because the court in that case did not rely on <em>any </em>of the circumstances noted by the majority here in support of its conclusion that the officer\u2019s statements amounted to the functional equiva<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>lent of interrogation. What is relevant is that the court in <em>In re EG </em>stated that the situation was \u201c[ujnlike the situation in <em>Innis\u201d </em>because \u201cno other person was present\u201d when the officer made the comments. <em>In re EG, 482 </em>A2d at 1248. <em>In re EG </em>concluded on the basis of that fact that the officer\u2019s comments were \u201cprecisely [the] type of tactic . . . [that] is prohibited by <em>Miranda\u201d </em>and, thus, the functional equivalent of interrogation under <em>Innis. Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\"><em>In re </em>EG\u2019s application of <em>Innis </em>is correct because, despite the majority\u2019s unwillingness to consider it, the primary focus of an <em>Innis </em>analysis must be \u201cupon the <em>perceptions of the suspect, </em>rather than the intent of the police.\u201d <em>Innis, </em>446 US at 301 (emphasis added). Thus, no matter how noble the officer\u2019s intent, if the officer should have known that it was reasonably likely that the suspect would perceive the statements as seeking a response that requires the suspect to divulge incriminating information, the officer\u2019s statements are the functional equivalent of interrogation.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">Similarly, the majority concludes that Stiles\u2019s comments were, at most, \u201csubtle compulsion\u201d because the comments were less \u201cevocative\u201d than the officers\u2019 comments in <em>Innis. </em>In support of this conclusion, the majority relies on the fact that Stiles made no mention of handicapped children or God. Again, this view of Stiles\u2019s statements ignores the <em>context </em>in which they were made; specifically, that the comments were unquestionably directed to defendant. As previously explained, depending on the context, a statement clearly directed to a specific person is reasonably likely to elicit a response from that person. Thus, while the <em>content </em>of Stiles\u2019s statement may not have been particularly \u201cevocative,\u201d Stiles should have known that, given the <em>context </em>in which the statement was made,, it was rea<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>sonably likely that defendant would perceive the statement as seeking to evoke a response.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-4\">Additionally, Stiles did not simply express his desire that no one else be harmed by the gun and then leave the room. Rather, Stiles pressed defendant by adding \u201cokay\u201d and, after a pause, further adding \u201call right.\u201d Although it is conceivable that these words did not amount to express questions for the reasons previously discussed, defendant could reasonably have perceived the words, along with the pause between them, as seeking a response on his part. The majority apparently rejects this possibility and instead assumes that Stiles was merely ensuring that defendant heard and understood his comments regarding the danger that the gun posed. See <em>ante </em>at 201-202. The majority fails to consider the next logical step in its analysis, however. Specifically, if Stiles was ensuring that defendant heard his statement, one must ask why Stiles made that effort. The most likely answer is that Stiles hoped that defendant would respond by divulging the gun\u2019s location. Thus, even if Stiles\u2019s motivation was purely altruistic as the majority speculates, he should have nevertheless known that his statement was reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from defendant. Accordingly, the statement satisfies the definition of the functional equivalent of interrogation from <em>Innis </em>because a suspect\u2019s constitutionally protected rights cannot be cast aside simply because the questioning officer\u2019s subjective intent may have been laudable.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-5\">The nature of Stiles\u2019s comments is also relevant to determining how defendant perceived the comments and whether Stiles should have known that his comments were reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from defendant. For example, <em>Arizona v Mauro, </em>481 US 520, 529; 107 S Ct 1931; 95 L Ed 2d 458 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>(1987), noted that <em>Miranda </em>and <em>Innis </em>held that subjecting a suspect to \u201ccompelling influences\u201d or \u201cpsychological ploys\u201d were techniques of persuasion that amount to interrogation when used in a custodial setting. <em>Mauro </em>also emphasized that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-4\">[i]n deciding whether particular police conduct is interrogation, we must remember the purpose behind our decisions in <em>Miranda </em>and <em>Edwards [v Arizona, </em>451 US 477; 101 S Ct 1880; 68 L Ed 2d 378 (1981)]: preventing government officials from using the coercive nature of confinement to extract confessions that would not be given in an unrestrained environment. <em>[Id. </em>at 529-530.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-5\">Mauro\u2019s analysis was based on <em>Innis, </em>which stated that <em>\u201cMiranda </em>also included in its survey of interrogation practices the use of <em>psychological ploys, </em>such as to \u2018posi[t]\u2019 \u2018the guilt of the subject/ to \u2018minimize the moral seriousness of the offense,\u2019 and \u2018to cast blame on the victim or on society.\u2019 \u201d <em>Innis, </em>446 US at 299, quoting <em>Miranda, </em>384 US at 450 (emphasis added) (alteration in original). Also, the <em>Mauro </em>Court explained that <em>Innis</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b482-6\">reviewed the police practices that had evoked the <em>Miranda </em>Court\u2019s concern about the coerciveness of the interrogation environment. The questioned practices included <em>... a variety of psychological ploys </em>.... None of these techniques involves express questioning, and yet the Court found that any of them, coupled with the interrogation environment, was likely to subjugate the individual to the will of his examiner and thereby undermine the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination. <em>[Mauro, </em>481 US at 526 (quotation marks and citations omitted; emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b482-7\">Thus, the majority is incorrect that <em>\u201cMauro </em>simply noted that the defendant in that case had <em>not </em>been subjected to \u2018psychological ploys.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ante </em>at 204 n 7. Rather, <em>Mauro </em>held that the defendant had not been interrogated precisely because the defendant was not subjected to psychological ploys. See <em>Mauro, </em>481 US at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>529 (stating that the defendant was not subjected to psychological ploys and concluding, \u201c[t]hus, [the defendant\u2019s] volunteered statements cannot properly be considered the result of police interrogation\u201d). Indeed, other jurisdictions have interpreted <em>Miranda, Innis, </em>and <em>Mauro </em>as holding that psychological ploys may constitute interrogation, depending on the circumstances of the case. See, e.g., <em>Commonwealth v Larkin, </em>429 Mass 426, 431 n 4; 708 NE2d 674 (1999) (noting that the functional equivalent of express questioning has been construed as \u201cincluding \u2018psychological ploys\u2019 likely to elicit [an incriminating] response\u201d), citing <em>Mauro, </em>481 US at 526.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-5\">In this case, Stiles\u2019s statements, which were expressly directed to defendant, played to the likelihood that defendant would respond to an expression of concern for the safety of others. Thus, the nature of Stiles\u2019s statements had the characteristics of a psychological ploy that exerted a compelling influence on defendant because the comments implied that defendant was the only person who knew where the gun was located and, thus, implied that defendant had a respon<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>sibility to make that information known so that others would not be harmed.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The only way that defendant could make that information known, however, was to give an incriminating statement in response to Stiles\u2019s statements. Thus, Stiles\u2019s statements used what <em>Miranda </em>identified as one of the hallmarks of interrogation: \u201c[t]he aura of confidence in [defendant\u2019s] guilt [that] undermines [defendant\u2019s] will to resist.\u201d <em>Miranda, </em>384 US at 455. Indeed, because the comments were expressly directed to defendant, Stiles placed defendant in a situation in which defendant \u201cmerely confirm[ed] the preconceived story the police [sought] to have him describe,\u201d i.e., that defendant knew the location of the gun because he had used the gun to commit the murder.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, Stiles should have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>known that his comments were reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response because it was reasonably likely that defendant would perceive the comments as compelling a response in order to protect others, particularly because Stiles expressly directed his statements to defendant.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Finally, other courts have recognized that a defendant\u2019s personal characteristics or relationship with the questioning officer might influence how that defendant perceives a police officer\u2019s statements. For example, in <em>Stewart, </em>668 A2d at 866, the defendant invoked his right to remain silent and, several hours later, a detective who had attended the same church as the defendant for many years took the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>defendant to a jail cell. The detective told the defendant not to feel bad about the situation and that the other members of the church would not judge him and would be a support group for him. Several hours after the detective made the religion-themed statements to the defendant, the detective again visited the defendant and the defendant confessed. <em>Stewart </em>held that the religion-themed statements amounted to unlawful interrogation and rejected the prosecution\u2019s argument that the detective\u2019s statements were spontaneous, casual, and purely of a personal nature. <em>Id. </em>The <em>Stewart </em>court explained that the detective was \u201can experienced homicide detective . . . capable of exploiting an opportunity.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Accordingly, \u201c[n]o conversation concerning a criminal investigation between such a detective and a suspect can be said to be \u2018purely personal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Rather, the <em>Stewart </em>court determined that the \u201cconversation can only be characterized as the first preparatory step of someone experienced in conducting interrogations.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Similarly, <em>In re EG, </em>482 A2d at 1248 n 6, noted the defendant\u2019s youthfulness as one of the circumstances supporting the conclusion that the officer should have known that his statements were reasonably likely to elicit a response, and <em>United States v Rivera-Ruiz, </em>unpublished opinion of the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota, issued May 14, 2002 (Docket No. CR 02-57 ADMRLE), held that \u201c[t]he [defendant's foreign status and likely unfamiliarity with U.S. constitutional rights\u201d were relevant to determining how the defendant perceived the officer\u2019s statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">In this case, defendant was 17 years old when he was arrested, and he had no prior criminal convictions. Although any person in police custody might view the questioning officer as an authority figure and thus feel compelled to respond to the officer\u2019s statements, defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>dant\u2019s youth and inexperience with the criminal justice system are relevant factors in determining how defendant perceived Stiles\u2019s comments. Because these factors, combined with the fact that Stiles\u2019s comments implied that defendant had a responsibility to protect others, increased the likelihood that defendant would feel compelled to respect and comply with Stiles as an authority figure, I would conclude that Stiles should have known that his comments were reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-4\">In summary, despite the similarities between the content of Stiles\u2019s comments in this case and the <em>Innis </em>officers\u2019 statements, I believe that several important factors distinguish this case from <em>Innis. </em>First, Stiles expressly directed his statements to defendant; thus, it was more likely that defendant would perceive the statements as seeking a response. Likewise, Stiles should have known that by expressly directing the comments to defendant, it was reasonably likely that defendant would respond. Second, Stiles\u2019s statements had the characteristics of a \u201cpsychological ploy\u201d that exerted a \u201ccompelling influence\u201d on defendant because the statements played to the likelihood that defendant would feel compelled to protect others. Third, several of defendant\u2019s individual personal characteristics increased the likelihood that he would perceive Stiles\u2019s comments as requiring a response.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">Accordingly, from the totality of the circumstances, I would conclude that it was not \u201cunforeseeable\u201d that Stiles\u2019s comments would result in an incriminating response from defendant. <em>Innis, </em>446 US at 302. Rather, defendant could have reasonably perceived that Stiles expected a response, and Stiles should have known that his comments were \u201creasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from [defendant].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 301. As a result, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>I believe that defendant was improperly subjected to the functional equivalent of interrogation after invoking his Fifth Amendment right against compelled self-incrimination. Accordingly, I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and reinstate the trial court\u2019s order suppressing defendant\u2019s incriminating statements.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b477-5\"> I disagree with the majority that Justice Marshall\u2019s <em>Innis </em>dissent is irrelevant.

Thus, I believe that Justice Marshall\u2019s opinion, while not binding, is relevant and worthy of some consideration as this Court weighs the totality of the circumstances in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b478-7\"> Notably, the record is devoid of any support for the majority\u2019s speculation regarding Stiles\u2019s subjective intent in making the statements at issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b478-8\"> Although <em>Innis </em>recognized that the officer\u2019s intent \u201cmay well have a bearing\u201d on the analysis, it also explained that the officer\u2019s intent is most relevant \u201cwhere a police practice <em>is designed </em>to elicit an incriminating response from the accused [because] it is unlikely that the practice will not also be one which the police should have known was reasonably likely to have that effect.\u201d <em>Innis, </em>446 US at 301 n 7 (emphasis added). Thus, the majority\u2019s speculative conclusion that Stiles <em>did not </em>intend to elicit an incriminating response is of little relevance because Stiles nevertheless should have known that his statement was reasonably likely to elicit an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>incriminating response.

For example, <em>Miranda, </em>384 US at 450, concluded that police tactics that \u201cminimize the moral seriousness of the offense\u201d or \u201ccast blame on the victim or on society\u201d are psychological ploys that may constitute interrogation practices depending on the circumstances. Surely, not all suspects would respond to such tactics, but the tactics nevertheless may constitute interrogation because they play to traits that are common to many, but not all, people. In my view, because concern for the safety of others is also a common human trait, the same is true of Stiles\u2019s comment. And when the compelling influence of Stiles\u2019s statement is combined with the custodial setting and other factors discussed throughout this opinion, I believe that defendant was subjected to the functional equivalent of questioning because the totality of the custodial circumstances caused defendant to make an incriminating statement \u201cthat would not [have been] given in an unrestrained environment.\u201d <em>Mauro, </em>481 US at 530.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b484-7\"> This aspect of Stiles\u2019s statements illustrates another significant difference between this case and <em>Innis. </em>Because the officers in <em>Innis </em>were merely conversing amongst themselves regarding their concern about the whereabouts of the gun, the <em>Innis </em>defendant was not placed in a situation in which he merely needed to confirm the officers\u2019 preconceived belief that he was guilty. Rather, as the <em>Innis </em>Court held, the officers\u2019 comments <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>did not compel <em>any </em>response from the defendant. Conversely, in this case, not only could Stiles\u2019s statement have been reasonably perceived by defendant as seeking a response given that the statement was expressly directed to him, the statement could also have exerted a compelling influence on defendant to merely confirm Stiles\u2019s preconceived conclusion that defendant had committed the crime.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b485-10\"> Contrary to the majority\u2019s interpretation of my opinion, this portion of my analysis does not conclude that defendant exhibited an \u201cunusual\u201d or \u201cpeculiar\u201d susceptibility to a certain form of persuasion. As previously explained, like many psychological interrogation techniques that rely on a human trait that is common to most people, Stiles\u2019s comments appealed to a common characteristic; concern for others. Rather than consider this possibility as part of a complete consideration of totality of the circumstances, the majority prefers to employ broad stereotypes, such as its belief that all suspects charged with homicide are cold-blooded killers. The majority\u2019s approach is erroneous because, if this were true, Stiles would not have bothered to make the statement at issue. Indeed, if Stiles had no reason to \u201cfathomQ\u201d that defendant harbored any concern for the safety of others given that \u201cdefendant had just been arrested for shooting another man to death for drugs,\u201d <em>ante </em>at 202-203, why would Stiles bother to make the statement? The majority fails to consider that, as defendant\u2019s incriminating statement suggests, he made an extremely poor decision to perpetrate a robbery, but the shooting was not the intended result. A poor decision that led to a deadly, but unintended, result does not automatically sap defendant of his humanity. Thus, the majority\u2019s analysis fails to consider the important factual intricacies of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b488-4\">MARY Beth Kelly, j.</author>\n<p id=\"ay-dedup-0\">(dissenting).

He wished defendant \u201cgood luck\u201d and told him: \u201cDon\u2019t take this personal. It\u2019s not personal between me and you . . ..\u201d He also assured defendant that \u201cI understand you\u2019ve got to [do] what you\u2019ve got to do to protect your best interests.\u201d Having presented himself as reasonable and understanding, Stiles invited defendant to make an incriminating response, telling defendant, \u201cI hope that the gun is in a place where nobody can get a hold of it and nobody else can get hurt by it, okay?\u201d Examining the remarks from the viewpoint of a teenager facing an authority figure in an interrogation room, I believe it reasonably foreseeable that the type of subtle coercive techniques Stiles used would prompt defendant to provide an incriminating response. As would be expected, defendant incriminated himself by stating, \u201cI didn\u2019t even mean for it to happen like that. It was a complete accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\">Even after defendant demonstrated his youthful vulnerability to subtle compulsion, Stiles continued the interview, again presenting himself as a reasonable individual in whom defendant could confide, telling defendant, \u201cI understand. I understand,\u201d and assuring defendant that he did not view him as \u201ca monster.\u201d The detective then interjected a reference to violence into the conversation, telling defendant: \u201cHey, look dude, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re a monster, all right? I don\u2019t think that. You could have came down to me and turned yourself in and there ain\u2019t no damn way I\u2019d beat you up.\u201d Such references to violence in the isolation of an interrogation room would reasonably increase the anxiety experienced by a youthful suspect. At the same time, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>Stiles also sought to establish ties with defendant, professing a familiarity with defendant\u2019s family members in town and asking defendant: \u201cWho knows you\u2019re here? Who knows of your family? Because I know a lot of your family in town now.\u201d Not surprisingly, the overwhelmed adolescent again responded with an incriminating statement, telling Stiles: \u201cI know that I didn\u2019t mean to do it. I guarantee that, I know I didn\u2019t mean to do it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b495-4\">When examined in their entirety, Stiles\u2019s remarks included a number of police tactics to which a vulnerable youth would be readily susceptible. The colloquy involved efforts to establish a rapport with defendant, including references to his family, while in the same conversation, Stiles also managed to heighten the inherent stress of a custodial situation by referring to violence. It was in this context that Stiles made the most obvious overture to elicit an incriminating response from defendant: the remark about the gun\u2019s location. While Stiles\u2019s remarks might not be reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from an adult, all these comments considered together, and in context, made it reasonably likely that the minor defendant in this case would respond in an incriminating manner. Consequently, because defendant\u2019s youthful susceptibility to compulsion would have been readily apparent and Stiles should have known that his remarks were reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response, I would hold that defendant was subjected to interrogation after he invoked his right to remain silent and I would suppress his statement.</p>\n<judges id=\"b495-5\">MCCORMACK, J., took no part in the decision of this case.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b488-6\"> <em>Miranda v Arizona, </em>384 US 436, 473-474; 86 S Ct 1602; 16 L Ed 2d 694 (1966).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b488-7\"> <em>Rhode Island v Innis, </em>446 US 291, 300-301; 100 S Ct 1682; 64 L Ed 2d 297 (1980).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b488-8\"> <em>Id. </em>at 300, 303 (quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b489-5\"> <em>Id. </em>at 301 (emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b489-6\"> <em>Id. </em>The intent of the police is relevant only insofar as it bears \u201con whether the police should have known that their words or actions were reasonably likely to evoke an incriminating response.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 301 n 7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b489-7\"> <em>Id. </em>at 302 n 8.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b489-8\"> <em>JDB v North Carolina, </em>564 US_,_; 131 S Ct 2394, 2403; 180 L Ed 2d 310 (2011), <em>quoting Bellotti v Baird, </em>443 US 622, 635; 99 S Ct 3035; 61 L Ed 2d 797 (1979); see also <em>Eddings v Oklahoma, </em>455 US 104, 115; 102 S Ct 869; 71 L Ed 2d 1 (1982) (recognizingyouth as a \u201ctime and condition of life when a person may be most susceptible to influence and to psychological damage\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b489-13\"> <em>JDB, </em>564 US at_; 131 S Ct at 2403; see also <em>Roper v Simmons, </em>543 US 551, 569; 125 S Ct 1183; 161 L Ed 2d 1 (2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b490-6\"> <em>Graham v Florida, </em>560 US_,_; 130 S Ct 2011, 2026; 176 L Ed 2d 825 (2010) (\u201c[Djevelopments in psychology and brain science continue to show fundamental differences between juvenile and adult minds.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b490-8\"> <em>JDB, </em>564 US at__,; 131 S Ct at 2403-2404; <em>Roper, </em>543 US at 569.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b490-9\"> <em>Haley v Ohio, </em>332 US 596, 599; 68 S Ct 302; 92 L Ed 224 (1948); see also <em>Gallegos v Colorado, </em>370 US 49, 54; 82 S Ct 1209; 8 L Ed 2d 325 (1962) (recognizing that a teenager, \u201cno matter how sophisticated,\u201d may not be \u201ccompared with an adult in full possession of his senses and knowledgeable of the consequences of his admissions\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b490-10\"> <em>JDB, </em>564 US at_; 131 S Ct at 2401, quoting <em>Miranda, </em>384 US at 467.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b490-12\"> See <em>JDB, </em>564 US at_; 131 S Ct at 2403 (\u201c[A] reasonable child subjected to police questioning will sometimes feel pressured to submit when a reasonable adult would feel free to go.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"14\">\n<p id=\"b490-14\"> <em>Haley, </em>332 US at 599 (concluding police conduct \u201cwhich would leave a man cold and unimpressed can overawe and overwhelm a lad in his early teens\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"15\">\n<p id=\"b491-5\"> <em>JDB, </em>564 US at_; 131 S Ct at 2403.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"16\">\n<p id=\"b491-6\"> <em>Innis, </em>446 US at 300-302; <em>Miranda, </em>384 US at 473-474 (\u201cIf the individual indicates in any manner, at any time prior to or during questioning, that he wishes to remain silent, the interrogation must cease.\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"17\">\n<p id=\"b491-7\"> The majority emphasizes that <em>JDB, </em>564 US at_; 131 S Ct at 2399, involved a 13-year-old defendant, suggesting that the unique attributes of adolescents recognized by the United States Supreme Court do not apply to 17-year-old minors. Contrary to the majority\u2019s suggestion, the Supreme Court also discussed many of the distinguishing characteristics of adolescents in <em>Roper, </em>543 US at 556, a case involving a defendant who committed murder when he was 17-years-old. Given the continued vulnerability of older teenagers, it can reasonably be supposed that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>protections afforded minors as a result of their unique characteristics apply to 17-year-olds such as defendant.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"18\">\n<p id=\"b492-16\"> <em>Miranda, </em>384 US at 479.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"19\">\n<p id=\"b493-17\"> The interrogation was recorded on a DVD.

Believing that the only relevant portion of the exchange involves Stiles\u2019s reference to the gun\u2019s location, the majority disputes whether a 17-year-old is more susceptible to an appeal to his or her conscience. But the colloquy must be regarded in its entirety. In its entirety, the appeal to defendant\u2019s conscience was coupled with references to violence and attempts to earn defendant\u2019s trust through expressions of understanding and references to defendant\u2019s family. It was to that <em>entire </em>exchange that the youthful defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>succumbed, not merely the isolated appeal to his conscience through the single question with regard to the location of the gun.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
