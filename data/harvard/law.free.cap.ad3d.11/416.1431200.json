Weinstein as co-counsel for the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">Ordered that the order is affirmed insofar as appealed and cross-appealed from, without costs or disbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">The Supreme Court providently exercised its discretion in disqualifying the plaintiffs\u2019 co-counsel Kenneth J. Weinstein due to his representation of the defendant Gerald M. Cotter 14 years earlier <em>(see Nationwide Assoc. v Targee St. Internal Medicine Group, </em>303 AD2d 728 [2003]). However, the plaintiffs sufficiently rebutted the presumption of shared confidences and disqualification with respect to the law firm Rosenberg Calica &amp; Birney, LLP <em>(see Kassis v Teacher\u2019s Ins. &amp; Annuity Assn., </em>93 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>NY2d 611, 617 [1999]; <em>Solow v Grace &amp; Co., </em>83 NY2d 303 [1994]).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-3\">The parties\u2019 remaining contentions are without merit. Ritter, J.P., S. Miller, Mastro and Fisher, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
