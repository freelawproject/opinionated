Couch, Jr., the petitioner, William Eugene Carter, was convicted of possession of heroin with intent to distribute in violation of Maryland Code (1957, 1971 Repl. Vol.) Art. 27, \u00a7 286 (a)(1).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Critical evidence, admitted at his trial, was 104.04 grams of heroin (34.6% pure) and 37.98 grams of starch (a cutting agent used in the distribution of heroin as a dilutent). These substances were seized on June 9, 1972, pursuant to a search and seizure warrant issued on June 8, 1972, by Judge Robert Mathias for the residence of the petitioner at apartment 926, 1836 Metzerott Road, Hyattsville, Maryland, a high rise apartment building of at least ten stories. Judge Mathias issued the warrant upon the application and affidavit of Detective Elmer L. Snow of the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department. Detective Snow, after specifying his police service, his specialized training in narcotics and his experience in investigating complaints of violations of the narcotic laws, attested to the following facts as bases for the issuance of the warrant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-7\">\u201cThat during the course of your affiant\u2019s official duties on March 3, 1972 your affiant was contacted <em>by a reliable confidential source of information. </em>That the said <em>confidential source of information is personally known to your affiant as reliable </em>in that <em>the said source </em>has furnished <em>information </em>to your affiant over a period of approximately two years which has been found to be <em>completely </em>true, and whose <em>information </em>has been the direct cause which led to the arrest and convictions of approximately ten persons who were convicted of violating the Controlled Dangerous Substance Laws of the State of Maryland. That the said <em>confidential source of information related </em>to your affiant that a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number>Negro/Male known only to the source as Chunkhead was involved in obtaining large quantities of Heroin from one William Eugene CARTER, a Negro male who resides inside apartment 926 at 1836 Metzerott Road, Hyattsville, Maryland. That the <em>source of information </em>further <em>related </em>that the said William Eugene CARTER would only sell direct in transactions of Heroin to the said Chunkhead for fear of a police agent becoming involved. That the <em>said source </em>further <em>related </em>that the said William Eugene CARTER is known throughout drug dealers in Washington, D.C. as a major supplier of Heroin, and was known to keep large quantities of Heroin inside his apartment at 1836 Metzerott Road, Apartment 926, Hyattsville, Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland. That the <em>said source </em>further <em>related </em>to your affiant that as recently as March 2, 1972 the <em>source </em>had <em>personally gone with </em>the said Chunkhead from his home at 1222 Queen St. N.E., Washington, D.C. to 1836 Metzerott Road, Hyattsville, Maryland where the said Chunkhead departed the vehicle and stated that he was going inside the premises to obtain Heroin from \u201cCarter\u201d. That after a short period of time, Chunkhead returned to the vehicle with an aluminum foil packet which the source personally used, and knew from his own drug use experience to be Heroin. That due to the evasive manner in which the said William Eugene CARTER allegedly conducts the illicit transactions of Heroin, your affiant has verified the <em>information received from the reliable confidential source of information </em>in the following manner:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-6\">On March 3, 1972 at 1900 hours your affiant, along with Lieutenant Hollis D. Jordan, Sergeant Joseph E. Thornberry, arid Detective John A. Lew of the Prince George\u2019s County Police Department Vice Control Section began a surveilance [sic] on the premises at 1222 Queen Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. That at approximately 1930 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"415\">*415</page-number>hours these Detective\u2019s, [sic] and your affiant personally observed a 1970 yellow Chevrolet, bearing Maryland Registration EA 72:56 arrive at the premise. That inside the said vehicle, your affiant personally observed, and recognized the two occupants of the vehicle. They are: Don Pedro DANIEL, and Harold James GADDY. Both of these persons are known to your affiant as violators of the Controlled Dangerous Substance Laws of the State of Maryland. That your affiant has personally arrested both of these persons for violations of the Controlled Dangerous Substance Laws of the State of Maryland. That an unknown Negro Male later identified as \u201cChunkhead\u201d was then observed leaving 1222 Queen Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. and entering the said 1970 Chevrolet operated by the said Don Pedro Daniel. That the three persons were then followed as they proceeded to 1836 Metzerott Road, Hyattsville, Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland where the vehicle parked in front of the said 1836 Metzerott Road, Hyattsville, Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland. That the Negro male known as Chunkhead then left the said vehicle at which time he was followed by Sergeant Joseph E. Thornberry, and Detective John A. Lew as he rode an apartment elevator to the ninth floor, where he knocked, and was admitted to apartment 926 at 1836 Metzerott Road, Hyattsville, Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland. That after approximately four minutes, \u201cChunkhead\u201d departed the said premises, and returned to the vehicle operated by the said Don Pedro Daniel. That the vehicle was then followed as the three occupants returned to 1222 Queen St. N.E., Washington, D.C. where the subject known as Chunkhead left the vehicle, and went into 1222 Queen St. N.E., Washington, D.C. That surveilance [sic] at that time was stopped for fear of being observed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-5\">That at 2345 hours on March 3, 1972 your affiant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>made a records check with the Criminal Records Division of the Metropolitan Police Department of Washington, D.C. That a photograph of William Eugene CARTER, D.C. Identification #105-082 was obtained. That investigation at that time did reveal that the said William Eugene CARTER has been arrested for the following offenses: 2/18/42 \u2014 Automobile Larceny in Pikesville, Maryland, 11/9/46 \u2014 Murder in Washington, D.C., 2/10/47 \u2014 Manslaughter, 2/15/51 \u2014 Operating a Lottery, 8/9/68 \u2014 Possession of Stolen Government Property, 10/14/68 \u2014 Uttering United States treasury Checks, 9/11/69 \u2014 Uttering United States Treasury Checks, 8/26/71 \u2014 Operating a Lottery.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-5\">That on March 6, 1972 your affiant contacted a Mrs. Dunn who was the resident manager of the Presidential Towers Apartments at 1836 Metzerott Road, Hyattsville, Maryland. At that time, Mrs. Dunn identified D.C.I.D. Photograph of William Eugene CARTER as the same person residing in apartment 926 at 1836 Metzerott Rd., Hyattsville, Maryland. At that time it was found by your affiant that the said William Eugene CARTER was not carried on the lease of the said apartment, but was the person who usually paid the rent for the said apartment.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-6\">That on April 11, 1972 your affiant was contacted by Special Agents of the United States Department of Justice, Bureau of Narcotics, and Dangerous Drugs. That Special Agent SANTOS of that Agency related to your affiant that the said William Eugene CARTER is known by that agency to be an associate of one Norman SMITH and Alphonso JACKSON, two major narcotic violators in the Washington, D.C. Metropolitan area.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b438-7\">That at 1230 hours on April 11, 1972, your affiant <em>was telephonically contacted by the aforementioned confidential source of information </em>who related that the said William Eugene CARTER has started delievering [sic] Heroin to 1222 Queen St. N.E. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>Washington, D.C. from his apartment at 1836 Metzerott Road, apartment 926, Hyattsville, Maryland because of fear of the said Chunkhead being followed to his residence where the drugs are maintained. That subsequent to the <em>information as received from the confidential source, </em>a surveilance [sic] was started at 1836 Metzerott Road, Hyattsville, Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland. That at 1400 hours on that date, a negro male, recognized by your affiant from M.P.D.C. Photo #105-082 departed the said premises in a 1965 Ford Station Wagon bearing D.C. registration plates 806-949. That a check with the Motor Vehicles Section of Washington, D.C. did reveal the said vehicle bearing District of Columbia Registration plates 806-949 to be listed to one William Eugene CARTER. That the said William Eugene CARTER proceeded to 1222 Queen St. N.E., Washington, D.C. where the said William Eugene CARTER went into the said premises, and the[n] departed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-5\">That subsequent to the visit by the said William Eugene CARTER, and more specifically on April 11, 1972, Special Agent Albert C. LOGAN of the United States Department of Justice, Bureau of Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs did make a Heroin buy for $80.00 from a Negro male known to Agent LOGAN as \u201cChunkhead\u201d while inside the premises at 1222 Queen St. N.E., Washington, D.C.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-6\">That on April 19, 1972 your affiant conducted a surveilance [sic] on the premises at 1836 Metzerott Road, Hyattsville, Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland. That at 2340 hours the said William Eugene CARTER departed the said premises in a black Lincoln bearing District of Columbia Registration plates 859-631. That a cheek by your affiant with the Department of Motor Vehicles of Washington, D.C. did reveal this vehicle to be listed to the said William Eugene CARTER. That the said William Eugene CARTER was followed by your affiant to 1222 Queen St. N.E., Washington, D.C. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>which time he parked the said vehicle and entered the front door of 1222 Queen St. N.E., Washington, D.C. at which time the said William Eugene CARTER remained for approximately five minutes, and departed. That the surveilance [sic] was discontinued at that time for fear that your affiant would be observed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-5\">That on May 19, 1972 your affiant conducted a surveilance [sic] on the premises at 1836 Metzerott Road, Hyattsville, Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland which began at 0920 Hours. That at 0950 hours the said William Eugene CARTER did depart the premises in his black Lincoln bearing District of Columbia Registration plates 859-631. That the said William Eugene CARTER was followed by your affiant to 1222 Queen Street, N.E., Washington, D.C. at which time he did enter the said premise, remain for approximately four minutes, and depart.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-6\">That on June 3, 1972 your affiant conducted a surveilance [sic] on the premises at 1836 Metzerott Road, Hyattsville, Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland which began at 0810 hours. That at 0840 hours, the said William Eugene CARTER did depart the premises in his black Lincoln bearing District of Columbia Registration plates 859-631. That the said William Eugene CARTER was followed by your affiant to 1222 Queen St. N.E., Washington, D.C. at which time he did enter the said premises, remain for approximately ten minutes, and departed. Your affiant stopped surveilance [sic] at this time for fear of being observed by the said William Eugene CARTER.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-7\">That on June 8, 1972 your affiant was again contacted by the <em>said confidential source of information </em>who related that the said William Eugene CARTER was schedule[d] to make a large narcotics drop on the morning of June 9, 1972 at 1222 Queen St. N.E., Washington, D.C.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-8\">That from the information as received from <em>the </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number><em>confidential source of information, </em>and which has been verified on numerous occasions by personal observations, and personal knowledge, your affiant feels that properties subject to search and seizure under the Controlled Dangerous Substance Laws of the State of Maryland are being concealed inside apartment 926 at 1836 Metzerott Road, Hyattsville, Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland, and that your affiant requests that a search warrant be issued on the aforementioned facts and affidavit.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">. Pursuant to Maryland Rule 729 b 1, counsel for the petitioner filed a motion for the suppression of the property seized pursuant to the search and seizure warrant on the basis that it had \u201cbeen obtained by an unlawful search and seizure.\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">The motion, supplemented by an attached memorandum, alleged <em>inter alia </em>that the affidavit, made in application for the warrant, on its face failed to demonstrate the existence of probable cause and that the statements therein were untrue, incomplete and constituted a material misrepresentation to, and a deliberate deception of, the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">When the motion came on for hearing before Judge Mathias \u2014 the same judge who had issued the warrant<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u2014 counsel for the petitioner explicated that the affidavit had failed to disclose to the court that information garnered during the investigation, as a basis for the affidavit, had been obtained through the employment by the police of illegal electronic surveillance and that the failure to disclose <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>such electronic surveillance in the affidavit constituted a deception upon the court which issued the warrant; secondarily, it was asserted that the affidavit did not set forth sufficient underlying circumstances that the alleged informants were credible and reliable.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">Counsel particularized his contentions by asserting that the police had commenced the illegal eavesdropping prior to March 3, <em>1972;</em><footnotemark><em>4</em></footnotemark><em> </em>that they had occupied an adjacent apartment \u201cand did use it in such a manner as to make it obvious that its [use] was for the purpose of illegal eavesdropping\u201d; that the affiant had requested, and been refused, the cooperation of the apartment engineer in installing a wire tap; that it was subsequently discovered that the room in which the building\u2019s telephone equipment was located had been forcibly entered, that a wire tap had been found upon the telephone of the building engineer and that a telephone company serviceman had found a wire tap upon a tenant\u2019s telephone.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">When Judge Mathias indicated to counsel that he would not permit him, in challenging the existence of probable cause, to go beyond the confines of the affidavit, counsel proffered to offer evidence: (a) that a Mrs. Dunn, the resident manager of the apartment building, would testify <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>that she had been contacted, prior to March 3, 1972, by Detective Snow and other officers, had been requested to give them a key to apartment 918, then vacant, which had a common wall with the apartment of Carter (apartment 926), and that with the use of such keys the police had come and gone at their leisure; (b) that the apartment switchboard operator, Mrs. Gordon, would testify that a Mr. Spaulding, a C. &amp; P. Telephone Company serviceman, in the course of his regular duties, had reported to her that he had found a \u201ctenant\u2019s phone was tapped\u201d; (c) that the building engineer, Mr. Garrett, would testify that prior to March 3, 1972, he had been contacted by Detective Snow and other officers and had been requested to assist them in installing a wire tap; that he refused without the exhibition of a court order, as a result of which he himself had become a \u201csuspect\u201d and discovered a tap on his telephone through a connection in the \u201cphone room\u201d; that additionally he had received information from the building\u2019s \u201csecurity people\u201d and had personally observed that the room for the telephone equipment had been forcibly opened shortly after his refusal of cooperation; (d) that Detective Snow [the affiant] would testify that he and other police agents had installed one or more wire taps on phones in the building, had overheard and recorded conversations therefrom and that at least one of such wire taps had been made pursuant to court order; (e) that the witnesses would testify that both prior to and after March 3rd illegal electronic surveillance had been conducted by the police, that a wire tap was placed upon the premises of one Hardy and that the defendant\u2019s apartment had been subjected to such electronic surveillance.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">Notwithstanding the proffer, no such testimony was received \u2014 or allowed; in denying the motion Judge Mathias ruled that the affidavit itself sufficiently established the existence of probable cause for the issuance of the warrant and \u201c[as] to the validity of the search warrant the court will not take any additional evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">The Court of Special Appeals, in affirming the petitioner\u2019s conviction, in an unreported <em>per curiam, Carter v. State </em>[No. 404, Sept. Term, 1973, decided March 14, 1974], had \u201cno <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>difficulty in finding that ample probable cause was established\u201d [from the affidavit]. Carter\u2019s contention that he had been denied due process of law \u201cwhen, at the hearing on his motion to suppress, the hearing judge declined to hear testimony as to possible wiretapping or eavesdropping, with the fruits of such primary illegality tainting the probable cause for the issuance of the warrant,\u201d was glossed over by simply finding \u201cit unnecessary to deal at this time with this troublesome question, because the direct police observations, which we have held sufficient to establish probable cause, are not even arguably the fruits of some poisonous tree.\u201d That court, in passing, opined that \u201c[i]t is by no means certain that, even if an unconstitutional wiretap or unconstitutional eavesdrop could be shown, that the fruits of such primary illegality could be used to diminish facially adequate probable cause.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">We granted certiorari because it appeared that if an unlawful wire tap or electronic surveillance had been used that the fruits of any such illegality could be of significance in tainting evidence which otherwise facially set forth a basis for the existence of such probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">As early as 1956 the General Assembly, in enacting the Maryland Wire Tapping Act, declared that \u201c[t]he right of the people to be secure against unreasonable interception of telephonic and telegraphic communications shall not be violated\u201d; it further declared it to be the public policy of this state \u201cthat the detection of the guilty does not justify investigative methods which infringe upon the liberties of the innocent.\u201d <em>See </em>Maryland Code (1957, 1971 Repl. Vol.) Art. 35, \u00a7 92 [now codified in Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article as \u00a7 10-401], <em>See also Robert v. State, </em>220 Md. 159, 169, 151 A. 2d 737, 742 (1959); <em>Manger v. State, </em>214 Md. 71, 75-76, 133 A. 2d 78, 80-81 (1957). That Act, providing that \u201c[o]nly evidence obtained in conformity with the provisions of this subtitle shall be admissible in evidence,\u201d (Article 35, \u00a7 97), prohibited the interception of telephonic and telegraphic communications etc., except upon an <em>ex parte </em>order issued by a judge of a court of general jurisdiction, upon a verified application of the Attorney <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>General, or any State\u2019s Attorney, upon the substantive grounds, and in accordance with the procedure specified in Art. 35, \u00a7 94 [now Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article, \u00a7 10-403]. The provisions specified in \u00a7 94 for the issuance of an <em>ex parte </em>order for the interception of a telephonic or telegraphic communication were equated, in both <em>Robert v. State, supra, </em>and <em>Manger v. State, supra, </em>with applications setting forth facts, generally similar to those required for the issuance of a search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">Complementary to the provisions of the Maryland Wire Tapping Act, the General Assembly, by Ch. 706 of the Acts of 1959, enacted Maryland Code (1957, 1971 Repl. Vol.) Art. 27, \u00a7\u00a7 125A-D, making it a misdemeanor for any person \u201cto use any electronic device or other device or equipment of any type whatsoever in such manner as to overhear or record any part of the conversation or words spoken to or by any person in private conversation without the knowledge or consent, expressed or implied, of that other person.\u201d Art. 27, \u00a7 125A (a).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> That statute, however, exempted from its applicability such acts when done pursuant to an <em>ex parte </em>court order. Art. 27, \u00a7 125A (b) and (c). See also Art. 35, \u00a7 94.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">In enacting Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510-2520, Congress \u201cunquestionably intended it as an offspring\u201d of the trilogy of eavesdropping cases decided during 1966 and 1967 by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Osborn v. United States, </em>385 U. S. 323 (1966) (upholding the use of a court authorized recording device and the admissibility of a recording of a conversation between an investigator, who had a relative on a jury panel, and the petitioner, a lawyer, who expressed an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>interest in approaching the juror);<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>Berger v. New York, </em>388 U. S. 41 (1967) (striking down New York\u2019s permissive eavesdropping statute, New York Code Crim. Proc. \u00a7 318-a, under which a court order permitted the installation of a recording device in an attorney\u2019s office for a period of 60 days, because the statute was \u201ctoo broad in its sweep resulting in a trespassory intrusion into a constitutionally protected area and ... violative of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments\u201d); and in <em>Katz v. United States, </em>389 U. S. 347 (1967) (holding the unlawful use of an electronic listening and recording device attached to the outside of a telephone booth without any prior judicial sanction as being in violation of the Fourth Amendment). <em>See State v. Siegel, </em>266 Md. 256, 264, 292 A. 2d 86, 90 (1972). The Act represents a comprehensive attempt by Congress to promote more effective control of crime while protecting the privacy of individual thought and expression; much of Title III was drawn to meet the constitutional requirements for electronic surveillance enunciated by the Supreme Court in <em>Berger </em>and in <em>Katz. United States v. United States District Court, </em>407 U. S. 297, 302 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510-2520 comprehensively provides for the authorization of electronic surveillance but only when conducted in accord with its standards. The classes of crimes within its scope are specified in \u00a7 2516; such surveillance is subject to prior court order; both wire and oral communications are within its protection. Section 2518 sets forth the detailed and particularized application necessary to obtain such an order, as well as carefully circumscribed conditions for its use. Among other things, \u00a7 2518 (10)(a) permits any aggrieved person, in any trial or proceeding, in or before any court, to move to suppress the contents of any intercepted wire or oral communication, or <em>evidence derived therefrom, </em>on the ground that its interception was unlawful, or that the order of authorization was insufficient on its face, or that the interception was not made in conformity with the order of authorization or approval. Section 2518 (9) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"425\">*425</page-number>requires that the defendant be furnished the contents of any such interception, or <em>evidence derived therefrom </em>not less than ten days before the trial, etc., else the contents of such intercepted communication, or <em>evidence derived therefrom, </em>\u201cshall not be received in evidence or otherwise disclosed in any trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2515 provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b447-6\">\u201cWhenever any wire or oral communication has been intercepted, no part of the contents of such communication and <em>no evidence derived therefrom </em>may be received in evidence in any trial, ... in or before any court, grand jury,... or other authority' of the United States, a State, or a political subdivision thereof if the disclosure of that information would be in violation of this chapter.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">In <em>State v. Siegel, supra, </em>Judge Digges, who wrote the opinion for the Court, after a thorough examination of the holdings in <em>Osborn, Berger </em>and <em>Katz, </em>and a complete analysis of the provisions In 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518, found that the statute was in conformity with the holdings in <em>Osborn, </em>provided for judicial intervention, the chief failing found in <em>Katz, </em>and responded to the \u201cfour basic problem areas\u201d involving the scope of the New York statute, enumerated in <em>Berger. </em>Thus, satisfied that the statute gratified the shortcomings found in <em>Katz </em>and <em>Berger, </em>the court concluded that \u201cTitle III is not violative of the Fourth Amendment.\u201d 266 Md. at 268-71, 292 A. 2d at 93-94.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">We further noted in <em>Siegel </em>that the federal act is \u201cnot self-executing as applied to the states\u201d; that \u00a7 2516 (2) provided for an application to be made by the prosecuting attorney of any state or political subdivision, in conformity with \u00a7 2518 if <em>\u201cauthorized by a statute of that state.\u201d </em>Holding that although a state act which is more closely circumscribed than the federal law is certainly permissible, under the holdings in <em>Robert v. State, supra, </em>any such state statute cannot be less restrictive than the federal statute, and finding the provisions of Art. 35, \u00a7\u00a7 92-99 and Art. 27, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 125A-D, to be such \u201capplicable state statutes\u201d as envisioned under \u00a7 2516 (2), the Court concluded that \u201ccompliance must be had with whichever law is more constricting, be it federal or state,\u201d and that the provisions of Title III, found to be constitutional, \u201cmay be properly implemented\u201d by state statute. 266 Md. at 272, 292 A. 2d at 95.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">In holding that the surveillance in <em>Siegel </em>\u201cfailed to meet certain preconditions designed to protect appellee\u2019s constitutional rights, the evidence that arose from it must be suppressed,\u201d the Court rejected a rationalization of \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d with the provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2518 by stating that \u201c[t]he statute sets up a strict procedure that <em>must </em>be followed and we will not abide any deviation, no matter how slight, from the prescribed path.\u201d 266 Md. at 274, 292 A. 2d at 95.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">In <em>United States v. United States District Court, supra, </em>although the Court held that the provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511 (3)(c) did not constitute a grant of authority upon the authorization of the Attorney General to conduct a warrantless surveillance in a <em>domestic </em>security case, it pointed out that there was no question of doubt \u201cas to the necessity of obtaining a warrant in the surveillance of crimes unrelated to the national security interest,\u201d citing both <em>Katz v. United States, supra, </em>and <em>Berger v. New York, supra. </em>407 U. S. at 308.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">In <em>United States v. Giordano, </em>416 U. S. 505 (1974), the Court construed 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2516 (1) to limit the power to authorize wire tap applications to the Attorney General and to any Assistant Attorney General he might designate, but not to include the Executive Assistant to the Attorney General. In pointing out that that interpretation of \u00a7 2516 (1) was supported by the purpose of the Act, effectively to prohibit all interceptions of oral or wire communications except those specifically provided for, Mr. Justice White, who delivered the majority opinion for the Court, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b448-8\">\u201cThe purpose of the legislation, which was passed in 1968, was effectively to prohibit, on the pain of criminal and civil penalties, all interceptions of oral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>and wire communications, except those specifically provided for in the Act, most notably those interceptions permitted to law enforcement officers when authorized by court order in connection with the investigation of the serious crimes listed in \u00a7 2516. Judicial wiretap orders must be preceded by applications containing prescribed information,. \u00a7 2518 (1). The judge must make certain findings before authorizing interceptions, including the existence of probable cause, \u00a7 2518 (3). The orders themselves must particularize the extent and nature of the interceptions that they authorize, \u00a7 2518 (4), and they expire within a specified time unless expressly extended by a judge based on further application by enforcement officials, \u00a7 2518 (5). Judicial supervision of the progress of the interception is provided for, \u00a7 2518 (6), as is official control of the custody of any recordings or tapes produced by the interceptions carried out pursuant to the order, \u00a7 2518 (8). The Act also contains provisions specifying the circumstances and procedures under and by which aggrieved persons may seek and obtain orders for the suppression of intercepted wire or oral communications sought to be used in evidence by the Government. \u00a7 2518 (10)(a).\u201d 416 U. S. at 514-15. (Footnote omitted.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">The Court concluded \u201cthat the provision for pre-application approval was intended to play a central role in the statutory scheme and that suppression must follow when it is shown that this statutory requirement has been ignored.\u201d 416 U. S. at 528. <em>Compare United States v. Chavez, </em>416 U. S. 562 (1974).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">In applying the provisions of \u00a7 2518 (10)(a)(i), providing for the suppression of evidence on the ground the communication was \u201cunlawfully intercepted,\u201d it was stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-10\">\u201cThe words \u2018unlawfully intercepted\u2019 are themselves not limited to constitutional violations, and we think Congress intended to require suppression <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>where there is failure to satisfy any of those statutory requirements that directly and substantially implement the congressional intention to limit the use of intercept procedures to those situations clearly calling for the employment of this extraordinary investigative device.\u201d 416 U. S. at 527.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">In holding that not only the primary but derivative evidence as well secured by the interceptions under the court orders must be suppressed under \u00a7 2518, upon a motion made under \u00a7 2518 (10)(a), Mr. Justice White, after pointing out that in the Government\u2019s application for an extension of the interception order it was sought not only to intercept the conversations of Giordano, who alone was expressly named in the initial application and order, but of nine other named persons who were alleged to be involved with Giordano, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-7\">\u201cIt is apparent from the foregoing that the communications intercepted pursuant to the extension order were evidence derived from the communications invalidly intercepted pursuant to the initial order. In the first place, the application sought and the order granted authority to intercept the communications of various named individuals not mentioned in the initial order. It is plain from the affidavit submitted that information about most of these persons was obtained through the initial illegal interceptions.\u201d 416 U. S. at 531-32.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">Finding that the results of the conversations overheard under the initial order were essential, both in fact and in law, to any extension of the intercept authority, the Court concluded that the \u201ccommunications intercepted under the extension order are derivative evidence and must be suppressed.\u201d 416 U. S. at 533.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-9\"><em>See also United States v. Bernstein, </em>509 F. 2d 996 (4th Cir. 1975) [The Daily Record, February 10, 1975], holding that Title III provides not only a right not to have unlawful intercepts used in court, but does more: it creates a right not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number>to be overheard except in conformity with its provisions, citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2511 (1). That Court concluded \u201cfrom the unequivocal language of Title III that Congress intended any unlawful invasion of an aggrieved person\u2019s privacy to be sufficient harm in itself to require suppression. <em>Cf. </em>United States v. Giordano, 416 U. S. 505, 524-29 (1974).\u201d 509 F. 2d at 1004.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">Under our holdings in <em>Siegel </em>and the holdings in <em>Giordano, </em>any electronic surveillance may be conducted only when done in accord with the rigid constraints imposed by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510-2520.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Thus, if Carter \u201cwas a party to any intercepted wire or oral communication, or a person against whom the interception was directed\u201d he, as an \u201caggrieved person\u201d (\u00a7 2510 (11)), would be entitled under \u00a7 2518 (10)(a)(i) to move \u201cto suppress the contents of any intercepted wire or oral communication, or <em>evidence derived therefrom,\u201d </em>if such communication was \u201cunlawfully intercepted,\u201d in violation of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">A \u201cconversation\u201d is within the Fourth Amendment\u2019s protection and the use of electronic devices to capture it is a \u201csearch\u201d within the meaning of that amendment. <em>See Berger v. New York, </em>388 U. S. at 51, citing <em>Olmstead v. United States, </em>277 U. S. 438 (1928).</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">In <em>Katz v. United States, supra, </em>the Court, finding that \u201cthe Fourth Amendment protects people, not places\u201d (389 U.

S. 129 (1942), as no longer controlling; and in finding that the recordation of the petitioner\u2019s words while using the telephone booth to which the device had been attached constituted a \u201c \u2018search and seizure\u2019 within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment,\u201d expressly held, citing <em>Silverman v. United States, </em>365 U. S. 505, 511 (1961), \u201cthat the Fourth Amendment governs not only the seizure of tangible items, but extends as well to the recording of oral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>statements, overheard without any \u2018technical trespass under . . . local property laws\u2019 \u201d and \u201cthat the reach of that [Fourth] Amendment cannot turn upon the presence or absence of a physical intrusion into any given enclosure.\u201d 389 U.

S. 385, the Supreme Court held that records initially seized \u201cwithout a shadow of authority,\u201d which had been inspected and copied by the District Attorney, could not supply a valid basis for a subpoena to produce the original of the documents \u2014 which had been ordered returned. Mr. Justice Holmes, who delivered the majority opinion of the Court, stated that \u201cthe knowledge gained by the Government\u2019s own wrong cannot be used by it in the way proposed,\u201d and concluding that to hold otherwise would reduce \u201cthe Fourth Amendment to a form of words,\u201d stated that \u201c[t]he essence of a provision forbidding the acquisition of evidence in a certain way is that not merely evidence so acquired shall not be used before the court but that it shall not be used at all\u201d \u2014 recognizing, of course, an exception when such knowledge \u201cis gained from an independent source.\u201d 251 U. S. at 392.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">In <em>Nardone v. United States, </em>302 U. S. 379 (1937), the Court reversed the petitioner\u2019s convictions on their first trial because they were procured by wire tap evidence in violation of \u00a7 605 of the Communications Act of 1934. Upon conviction, following a new trial, the case revisited the Court in <em>Nardone v. United States, </em>308 U. S. 338 (1939), presenting as its only question: \u201c \u2018whether the [trial] judge improperly refused to allow the accused to examine the prosecution as to the uses to which it had put the information,\u2019 \u201d \u2014 which had vitiated the original conviction. In reversing the convictions and remanding the case to the District Court for further proceedings the Court held that a violation of \u00a7 605 not only rendered the intercepted conversations themselves inadmissible, but rendered inadmissible as well evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>procured through the use of knowledge gained from such conversations.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Mr. Justice Frankfurter, who delivered the majority opinion for the Court, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b453-6\">\u201cThis Court found that the logically relevant proof which Congress had outlawed, it outlawed because \u2018inconsistent with ethical standards and destructive of personal liberty.\u2019 302 U.

To forbid the direct use of methods thus characterized but to put no curb on their full indirect use would only invite the very methods deemed \u2018inconsistent with ethical standards and destructive of personal liberty.\u2019 \u201d 308 U.S. at 340.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">Finding the holdings in <em>Silverthorne Lumber Co. v.

United States, supra, </em>stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-5\">\u201cThe exclusionary rule has traditionally barred from trial physical, tangible materials obtained either during or as a direct result of an unlawful invasion. It follows from our holding in <em>Silverman v. United States, </em>365 U. S. 505, that the Fourth Amendment may protect against the overhearing of verbal statements as well as against the more traditional seizure of \u2018papers and effects.\u2019 Similarly, testimony as to matters observed during an unlawful invasion has been excluded in order to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>enforce the basic constitutional policies. <em>McGinnis v. United States, </em>227 F. 2d 598. Thus, verbal evidence whieh derives so immediately from an unlawful entry and an unauthorized arrest as the officers\u2019 action in the present case is no less the \u2018fruit\u2019 of official illegality than the more common tangible fruits of the unwarranted intrusion. <em>See Nueslein v. District of Columbia, </em>115 F. 2d 690. Nor do the policies underlying the exclusionary rule invite any logical distinction between physical and verbal evidence....\u201d (Footnote omitted.) 371 U. S. at 485-86.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">In holding that the exclusion of Toy\u2019s declarations which led the police to the recovery of narcotics required the exclusion of the narcotics seized, the opinion stated further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b455-7\">\u201c[T]he more apt question in such a case is \u2018whether, granting establishment of the primary illegality, the evidence to which instant objection is made has been come at by exploitation of that illegality or instead by means sufficiently distinguishable to be purged of the primary taint.\u2019 Maguire, Evidence of Guilt, 221 (1959). We think it clear that the narcotics were \u2018come at <em>by the exploitation of that illegality\u2019 </em>and hence that they may not be used against Toy.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) 371 U.

Cephas, </em>447 Pa. 500, 291 A. 2d 106 (1972), held that the defendant\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights were violated by the evidentiary use at his trial \u2014 over objection and after a motion to suppress \u2014 of the testimony of a witness who was found in the defendant\u2019s apartment during the course of an admittedly illegal search.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-11\">Pointing out that the police had \u201cno independent source\u201d of information as to the existence of the witness, or the information which she gave them, the court found the verbal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>evidence offered through her came within the protection of the exclusionary rule if such evidence was a \u201cfruit\u201d of the illegality. Applying the reasoning and holdings in <em>Wong Sun, Nardone </em>and <em>Silverthome Lumber Company, </em>that court concluded that the inculpatory statement obtained by th\u00e9 police from the witness during the course of the unlawful search and seizure constituted an \u201cexploitation\u201d of the illegality and not by a means sufficiently distinguishable to be purged of the primary taint. In holding that the witness\u2019s testimony should have been suppressed, the court stated: \u201c[t]o permit the prosecution to use a witness obtained as a direct result of an illegal search will frustrate the objectives of the Fourth Amendment just as much as would use of a tangible article found during the same search, thus, the Fourth Amendment would be turned into a mere \u2018form of words\u2019.\u201d 447 Pa. at 511, 291 A. 2d at 112.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">In <em>Alderman v.

Fruits of such evidence are excluded as well. <em>Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States, </em>251 U. S. 385, 391-92 (1920).

Nothing seen or found on the premises may legally form the basis for an arrest or search warrant or for testimony at the homeowner\u2019s trial, since the prosecution would be using the fruits of a Fourth Amendment violation. <em>Silverthorne Lumber Co. v.

The rights of the owner of the premises are as clearly invaded when the police enter and install a listening device in his house as they are when the entry is made to undertake a warrantless search for tangible property; and the prosecution as surely employs the fruits of an illegal search of the home when it offers overheard third-party conversations as it does when it introduces tangible evidence belonging not to the homeowner, but to others....\u201d (Citing <em>Silverman v.

State, supra, </em>and the cases in which it has been consistently applied. Although the petitioner in his motion to suppress asserted that a \u201cdeception\u201d had been practiced upon the issuing court \u2014 in the failure to disclose the use of electronic surveillance \u2014 his principal thrust was that an illegal electronic surveillance by the police was the derivative source of the facts set forth in the affidavit and that such illegal conduct tainted the facts so discovered and resulted from exploitation of such surveillance. The petitioner\u2019s attack was thus not directed in challenging the truth of the grounds set forth in the affidavit nor an attempt to controvert them, but rather challenged the legality of the source by which such facts, assuming them to be true, had been acquired.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">Without diminishing the viability of our rule proscribing any controversion of the truth of the grounds stated in an affidavit in application for a search and seizure warrant, we find that the proffer made by counsel in support of his motion to suppress challenging the source of those facts, in view of the clear statutory language in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2515 and \u00a7 2518 (10)(a) \u2014 authorizing a suppression upon such grounds \u2014 and the holdings by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Alderman v. United States, supra, </em>and in <em>United States v. United States District Court, supra, </em>required an evidentiary hearing. <em>See Gelbard v. United States, </em>408 U. S. 41, 50-51 (1972), holding that \u00a7 2515 is \u201ccentral to the legislative scheme,\u201d that \u201cits importance as a protection for the \u2018victim of an unlawful invasion of privacy\u2019 could not be more clear\u201d ; and that \u201c\u00a7 2515 serves not only to protect the privacy of communications, but also to ensure that the courts do not become partners to illegal conduct: the evidentiary prohibition was enacted also \u2018to protect the integrity of court and administrative proceedings.\u2019 \u201d The Court there held that \u201cto order a grand jury witness, on pain of imprisonment [for contempt], to disclose evidence that \u00a7 2515 bars in unequivocal terms is both to thwart the congressional objective of protecting individual privacy by excluding such evidence and to entangle the courts in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>illegal acts of Government agents.\u201d 408 U. S. at 51.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> (Footnote omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">We think the Court of Appeals of Kentucky stated the rule well in <em>White v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Ky. 535, 299 S. W. 168 (1927), cited with approval in <em>Clark v. Commonwealth, </em>288 Ky. 845, 157 S.W.2d 485 (1941), when it said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-6\">\u201cWhile it is the rule in this state that, where the affidavit and search warrant are regular and sufficient on their face, the defendant cannot go behind the search warrant for the purpose of showing that the facts stated in the affidavit are not true, the case under consideration is not of that kind. Here the attack is not on the truth of the facts stated in the affidavit, but on the method by which the affiant obtained the information of the facts. If it were the rule that an officer could make an illegal search of one\u2019s premises and then use the information thus obtained as the basis for a search warrant authorizing him to search the premises, then the whole purpose of the constitutional provision against unreasonable search and seizure would be defeated. Manifestly, it is just as unlawful for an officer to make an illegal search of one\u2019s premises for the purpose of acquiring information of facts on which to base an affidavit as it is to make an illegal search for the purpose of obtaining evidence on which to base a conviction. We are therefore of the opinion that the defendant .. . may go behind the search warrant and affidavit for the purpose of showing that knowledge of the facts stated in the affidavit was obtained by an illegal search made by the affiant.\u201d 221 Ky. at 537, 299 S.

State, supra; Shrout v. State, </em>238 Md. 170, 175, 208 A. 2d 585, 588 (1965); <em>Kapler v. State, </em>194 Md. 580, 587-88, 71 A. 2d 860, 863 (1950); and <em>Bratburd v.

State, </em>200 Md. 133, 139, 88 A. 2d 556, 559 (1952), where it similarly had been proffered that <em>some </em>of the evidence on which the affidavit was based had been obtained by \u201cwire-tapping\u201d in violation of the Maryland Wire Tapping Act. Although fully cognizant of this precept, in view of the repetitive use of the ambiguous phrase, \u201cconfidential reliable source of information,\u201d as the possible origin of facts set forth in the affidavit, and in view of the totality of evidence proffered by the petitioner \u2014 particularly his proffer concerning the use of the adjacent apartment and that his phone had been tapped \u2014 in his assertion that the facts set forth in the affidavit originated with and became tainted as a result of an alleged illegal electronic surveillance, we cannot here apply the principle. In view of the possible taint of the facts set forth in the affidavit, which otherwise facially appears to provide a basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>for probable cause, we are unable to conclude, as did the Court of Special Appeals, that there is \u201cno difficulty in finding that ample probable cause was established.\u201d Contrariwise, we believe that the evidence proffered prima facie mandated an evidentiary hearing on the motion to suppress in order to determine whether or not the facts to which affidavit was made were tainted. Because of the error on the part of the trial judge in applying the rationale in <em>Smith v. State, supra, </em>restricting the attack to the \u201cfour corners\u201d of the affidavit and in not affording the petitioner an opportunity to produce evidence as to whether or not any of the data had been \u201ccome upon\u201d by an exploitation of an asserted electronic surveillance, we are precluded, under our holdings in <em>Gill v. State, </em>265 Md. 350, 289 A. 2d 575 (1972), from making a \u201crestricted remand\u201d for such a hearing limited to this issue, but are, instead, required to set aside and reverse the judgment and order a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">Upon remand the trial court shall conduct an evidentiary hearing to determine in the first instance whether or not any wire tapping or electronic eavesdropping was conducted in violation of Carter\u2019s rights under the Fourth Amendment, or under the provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510-2520. In such proceedings Carter must be given the opportunity to show that the facts sworn to in the affidavit as a basis for \u201cprobable cause\u201d were obtained either directly or derivatively as an exploitation of any such illegal \u201csearch.\u201d <em>See United States v. United States District Court, supra; Alderman v. United States, supra; Nardone v. United States, supra; People v. Mendez, supra. See also United States v. Giordano, supra; State v.

United States District Court, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number><em>supra; Alderman v. United States, supra; Nardone v. United States, supra; United States v.

State, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">In the context of an adversary proceeding, in order to be able to rebut any evidence by the prosecution that the facts set forth in the affidavit were untainted, and to gratify the standard of \u201carguable relevance,\u201d the prosecution is required to disclose to the petitioner the intercept logs and all materials and records of \u201cthose overheard conversations which the government was not entitled to use in building its case against\u201d him; Carter possesses as well the right \u201cto cross-examine the appropriate officials in regard to the connection between those records and the case made against him\u201d in application for the warrant. <em>Alderman v. United States, supra. In accord, United States v. United States District Court, supra; United States v. Fox, supra. </em>This disclosure, however, is limited to those records concerning Carter\u2019s own conversations or those taking place upon his premises or those conversations in connection with which he is an \u201caggrieved person.\u201d <em>See Alderman v. United States, supra; </em>and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2510 (11).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">In such an evidentiary hearing the trial judge \u201cshould confine the evidence presented by both sides to that which is material to the question of possible violation of the petitioner\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights, to the content of conversations illegally overheard by surveillance which violated those rights \u2014 [both constitutional and under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510-2520] and to the relevance of such conversations to the petitioner\u2019s\u201d subsequent subjection to search and seizure under the warrant. <em>See Alderman v.
