(St. Luke\u2019s), aggrieved at the entry of a judgment in the amount of $1,850 in favor of the appellee, Rita E. DiGiulian (on her counter-claim), for breach of a written lease, following a nonjury trial in the Circuit Court for Montgomery County (John J. Mitchell, J.), urges us to reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b340-11\">In January 1971 Mrs. DiGiulian purchased the property known as 3910 East-West Highway located in Section 4 of the Town of Chevy Chase, intending to use it as a residence for herself and her family. After the completion of extensive remodeling and restoration the idea of occupying it as a residence was abandoned and a \u201cFor Rent By Owner\u201d sign was posted on the property. Mrs. Audrey M. Henrickson,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a licensed realtor with the Routh Robbins Real Estate Company induced Mrs. DiGiulian to give her a listing on the property, stating that she had a South American diplomat as a prospective tenant. When that tenancy did not materialize, Mrs. Henrickson, a member of the Board of Directors of St. Luke\u2019s and, together with the president of the Board, a member of its Site Procurement Committee, succeeded in having a lease executed between St. Luke\u2019s and Mrs. DiGiulian. St. Luke\u2019s, a private, nonprofit organization, operating \u201chalfway houses\u201d designed to provide a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>transitional step for those recuperating from mental illnesses who had been released from institutional care and were being returned to community life, had been searching for a home like the DiGiulian premises for use as such a \u201chalfway house.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b341-5\">The lease, on a standard form of the Routh Robbins Real Estate Company, was in pertinent parts prepared by Mrs. Henrickson in collaboration with Frank H. Dearden, Jr., president of St. Luke\u2019s Board and also a professor at the University of Maryland School of Social Work and Community Planning. The lease, for a two-year term, effective July 1, 1971, was for a total rental of $19,200 \u201cpayable in monthly installments of $800.\u201d Standard printed clauses therein provided that it \u201ccontains the entire agreement between the parties hereto and shall not be changed or modified in any manner except by an instrument in writing executed by the parties hereto\u201d; and that the tenant \u201cwill not use and will not permit the property or any part thereof to be used for any . . . unlawful purpose.\u201d Provision was also made in the lease for the payment of a commission of $400 to Mrs. Henrickson.</p>\n<p id=\"b341-6\">Paragraph 3 of the lease, as modified by an addendum, provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-7\">\u201cTenant will use said property as a residence for five (5) persons and for no other purpose or additional number of persons whatever, subject to modifications noted in Addendum Clause <em>#1.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b341-8\">Addendum #1 \u2014 It is understood and agreed that Tenant intends to apply for and to obtain a permit and/or variance and license to operate a boarding house from the proper Montgomery County or Chevy Chase authorities which would allow Tenant to have up to nine residents and two employees living on the premises. Should the Tenant be unable to secure the necessary permits by April 1, 1972, then Tenant may give Landlord thirty (30) days\u2019 notice of intent to vacate. If such notice is not forthcoming by July 1, 1972, then this provision will be deemed waived.. ..\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b342-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"320\">*320</page-number>Another addendum provided that the tenant in each quarter would deposit with an escrow agent a sum equal to one-quarter\u2019s rent ($2,400) for disbursement to the landlord.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Two restrictions on the use of the property were the catalysts which gave rise to the litigation; one, the Montgomery County zoning ordinance which restricted occupancy in a single family dwelling, in an R-60 zone, to not more than five unrelated adults, but subject under the zoning ordinance to \u201ca special exception\u201d;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the other, a restriction contained in a covenant running with the land under a deed dated 1910 from the Chevy Chase Land Company of Montgomery County, Maryland, to which Mrs. DiGiulian\u2019s property \u2014 and the other lots in Section 4 \u2014 was subject, and which provided that \u201call houses upon the premises hereby conveyed shall be built and used for residence purposes exclusively . . . and that no trade, business, manufacture or sales, or nuisance of any kind, shall be carried on or permitted upon said premises.\u201d The restrictions in the deed further provided that any house erected upon the land \u201cshall be designed for the occupancy of a single family\u201d and that any violation of such covenants and agreements might be enjoined by the Chevy Chase Land Company, including those who derive title from said company.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">Prior to August 16, 1971 it appears that there had been extensive newspaper publicity concerning the nature of the occupancy of the premises by St. Luke\u2019s; there had been several meetings between the Board of Directors of St. Luke\u2019s and the \u201cCouncil\u201d of Section 4 of Chevy Chase, as well as a \u201ccitizens\u2019 meeting,\u201d as a result of all of which the neighbors, residents in Section 4, had given notice of their intention to seek injunctive relief against the operation of the \u201chalfway house.\u201d Although furniture had been moved into the premises in early July, it had not yet become occupied when, on August 16th, the Board authorized its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>attorney to file the necessary petition for special exemption under the zoning law, as contemplated in Addendum #1.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">Before the petition could be filed the Circuit Court for Montgomery County (Shure, J.), following a bill of complaint filed by 13 neighbors and the Town Council of Chevy Chase, on August 17th, pursuant to Maryland Rule BB72, issued an <em>ex parte </em>injunction restraining both the appellant and appellee \u201cfrom operating a Halfway House on the leased premises known as 3910 East-West Highway.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">Counsel for the Board upon ascertaining that the restrictive covenant appeared to be identical to that applied by this Court in <em>Chevy Chase Village v. Jaggers, </em>261 Md. 309, 275 A. 2d 167 (1971), wrote an opinion for the Board in which he concluded that the filing of a petition for special exception, even if allowed, would not grant relief from the restriction in the deed and that St. Luke\u2019s could not successfully defend its postition against the restriction. He advised St. Luke\u2019s \u201cto immediately seek another location,\u201d to remove all equipment from the premises and to treat the lease as null and void.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">Although St. Luke\u2019s filed an answer in the injunction proceedings in which it disclaimed knowledge of the existence of the \u201ccovenants\u201d in the deed, and contended, <em>inter alia, </em>that its use of the premises would constitute a use under the zoning ordinance by a \u201cfamily,\u201d it did not otherwise contest the injunction granted, but vacated the premises. When the injunction proceedings came on for hearing on September 24, 1971, the complainants\u2019 motion for dismissal on the grounds of mootness was granted since St. Luke\u2019s had discontinued the use of the premises and they had been re-leased.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">When St. Luke\u2019s abandoned the building Mrs. Henrickson still acting as the agent for Mrs. DiGiulian, secured another tenant for a lease commencing September 15, 1971 and ending April 30, 1972, at a monthly rental of $500.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">St. Luke\u2019s sued Mrs. DiGiulian when she refused to refund $1,600 of the deposited rent; under her counter-claim she was awarded damages computed at $800 per month for the period July 1 to September 15, 1971 ($2,000), plus $300 per <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>month from September 15, 1971 to April 15, 1972, and $150 for the period April 15 to April 30, 1972 (totalling $4,250), less credit for the $2,400 deposit.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-5\">In urging a reversal St. Luke\u2019s contends (a) that the trial court erroneously excluded parol evidence which, if admitted, would have established \u201cmutual mistake\u201d as to the restrictive covenant; (b) that the restrictive covenant, running with the land, created a \u201cfrustration of use\u201d and/or an \u201cimpossibility of performance\u201d which granted the lessee the right to rescind the lease and (c) that the lease was breached by the appellee since she leased the premises for a purpose not allowed by the restrictive covenant and she failed in her duty, upon the institution of the injunction proceedings, to defend the tenant\u2019s \u201cimplied warranty of quiet enjoyment.\u201d <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">At the trial counsel for St. Luke\u2019s, upon direct examination of Dearden, asked: \u201cWhat was the purpose of that lease to be in terms of St. Luke\u2019s House?\u201d Appellee\u2019s objection, on the ground that \u201cthe lease will speak for itself,\u201d was sustained, counsel conceding, however, \u201c[tjheir understanding or attempts to negotiate will be something else.\u201d Notwithstanding the sustaining of the objection to that question, Dearden did testify, without objection, that there had been extensive discussions with Mrs. DiGiulian concerning the purpose for which her house would be used, that she was informed that it was to be \u201cused as a halfway house for people recovering from mental illness,\u201d and that she did not indicate any constraint upon such use other than under the zoning laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-7\">Mrs. Henrickson similarly testified, without objection, that she had explained to the appellee the purpose for which the house was needed. Although an objection was sustained to a question addressed to her as to whether she was given any indication \u201cthat the purpose which you had discussed with Mrs. DiGiulian could not come to pass as a result of any restriction,\u201d she testified, without objection, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>Mrs. DiGiulian had not indicated to her any \u201crestriction\u201d other than zoning upon the use of the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">The attorney who was commissioned to prepare the petition for special exception and who prepared the opinion for the Board testified that he was \u201creasonably certain\u201d that he was a member of St. Luke\u2019s Board at this time, and although he was familiar with the restrictions in Section 4 of Chevy Chase, he was apparently not consulted when the lease was executed.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">Also without objection, Mrs. DiGiulian testified that when both Mrs. Henrickson and Dearden explained to her that they wanted to use her property as a \u201chalfway house\u201d she told Mrs. Henrickson, whom she did not know, at that time, to have been a member of St. Luke\u2019s Board, that the property could only be used as a residence and that \u201cif she had anything else [contemplated] that she must check thoroughly with the \u2018state\u2019 [zoning], as well as [under] \u2018Section 4\u2019 [Chevy Chase] . . . and that is written on my deed,\u201d to which Mrs. Henrickson replied: \u201cDon\u2019t worry about it because she [Mrs. Henrickson] had been renting and selling within this area for a long time.\u201d The appellee further, without objection, testified that when Dearden explained the purpose for which the house would be used she replied: \u201cRemember, this is only, could be used as far as I am concerned, it is always used as a residence, but if you check with the state and with Section 4 and you get the permission, only if you get the permission, but don\u2019t ever say that I gave you this home as anything but a residence.\u201d She also testified that in her dialogue with Dearden he represented to her that St. Luke\u2019s had \u201cother uses for the property, other than as a halfway house.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-7\">There was additional testimony from Mrs. DiGiulian that she \u201cwould have no parts of anything, but as a \u2018residence\u2019 \u201d and that although she was aware of a restriction in her deed she did not check it because Mrs. Henrickson \u201cwas working for me\u201d and was being paid for representing her in renting her property.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">Although it is true that \u201c \u2018while parol evidence is not admissible to alter or vary a written instrument expressing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>an agreement, it may be admitted to show that, because of a mutual mistake of the parties, their minds never met as to its subject-matter, and that consequently there never was an agreement. Where that fact is clearly shown, it is generally but not uniformly held that the instrument may be cancelled.\u2019 \u201d <em>Smith v. Bounds Package Corp., </em>206 Md. 74, 79, 110 A. 2d 71, 73 (1954), quoting from <em>Gross v. Stone, </em>173 Md. 653, 665, 197 A. 137, 142 (1938). <em>See also 4500 Suitland Rd. Corp. v. Ciccarello, </em>269 Md. 444, 451-52, 306 A. 2d 512, 516 (1973). In view of the length and breadth of the parol evidence received without objection from Mrs. Henrickson, Dearden and Mrs. DiGiulian, the principals in the negotiations of the lease, it is clear to us that the trial judge did not exclude parol evidence which might have established \u201cmutual mistake.\u201d Although it is true that objections were sustained in two instances to questions addressed to the appellant\u2019s witnesses, it is patent that such objections were sustained as to the form of the questions propounded rather than to an exclusion of parcl evidence. In any event, assuming <em>arguendo </em>that there may have been error in sustaining the objections in those two instances, such error must be considered harmless since the witnesses were otherwise permitted to give the same testimony, under questions in different form, and did, in fact, testify to each aspect of the pre-execution negotiations between the parties. <em>See Riley v. Naylor, </em>179 Md. 1, 16 A. 2d 857 (1940); <em>Snyder &amp; Blankfard, Co. v. Farmers</em>\u2019 <em>Bank of Tifton, </em>178 Md. 601, 16 A. 2d 837 (1940); <em>Berg v. Plitt, </em>178 Md. 155, 12 A. 2d 609, <em>reargument denied, </em>13 A. 2d 364 (1940).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-5\">In rejecting the contention that St. Luke\u2019s had no knowledge of the covenant and that thus there had been no \u201cmeeting of the minds,\u201d the trial court found that the negotiations leading up to the lease were conducted by Mrs. Henrickson who had assumed \u201ca dual role, that of rental agent for Mrs. DiGiulian and that of [a] representative of St. Luke\u2019s,\u201d and that even though it was her testimony \u201cthat she considered herself to be representing St. Luke\u2019s and not Mrs. DiGiulian at the time St. Luke\u2019s entered the negotiations, this belief was never actually communicated to Mrs. DiGiulian.\u201d The trial court further found that \u201c[i]n either <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>capacity, Mrs. Goss [Henrickson] should have been aware of any covenants running with the land and certainly as a representative of St. Luke\u2019s should have known those facts, unless she believed them not to be an impediment to the prospective use of the property.\u201d The trial court also pointed out that both the lease and the addenda, prepared by Mrs. Henrickson and Dearden, were \u201cin terms most favorable to St. Luke\u2019s.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">We cannot say that these conclusions by the trial court, which had the opportunity to pass upon the credibility and the weight to be given the evidence, were clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-6\">Finding that the holdings in <em>Chevy Chase Village v. Jaggers, supra,</em><footnotemark><em>5</em></footnotemark><em> </em>were not dispositive of the issue of an \u201cimpossibility of performance\u201d on the part of St. Luke\u2019s and were, on the facts, distinguishable, since <em>Jaggers </em>involved the use of a residence for a purely business purpose, the trial court concluded that St. Luke\u2019s before terminating the lease had a \u201cminimal obligation\u201d to contest in court the issuance of the injunction. Pointing out that the questions of law involved in the injunction were different than those then before the trial court and that it would be \u201csenseless to speculate as to the ultimate outcome of the injunction\u201d proceedings, the trial court nonetheless observed that \u201cthere were already in existence certain exceptions to the covenants which had been permitted,\u201d that it was by no means certain that the contemplated use of the premises by St. Luke\u2019s was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>not primarily \u201cfor residential purposes\u201d and therefore not in violation of the restrictive covenant, but that \u201cat no time did St. Luke\u2019s do anything to challenge the injunction\u201d and thus could not justify its termination of the lease on the existence of the restrictive covenant or upon the issuance of the <em>ex parte </em>injunction, purportedly undertaken to enforce the covenant, which went uncontested by St. Luke\u2019s.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b348-5\">The result reached by the trial court is in accord with the rationale of our holdings in <em>McNally v. Moser, </em>210 Md. 127, 122 A. 2d 555 (1956), which we find to be determinative of the principal contention raised by the appellant, that the restrictive covenant \u2014 and the <em>ex parte </em>injunction \u2014 created a \u201cfrustration of use\u201d and/or an \u201cimpossibility of performance.\u201d In <em>McNally </em>a chiropractor, who had been an assistant to Dr. Moser, purchased his practice and equipment and rented the office space from the appellee in 1951 for a ten-year term. Prior to an incapacitating illness Dr. Moser had maintained the office space on the ground floor of the building in which he resided. McNally, a nonresident of the building, notified the appellee in 1954 that it was his understanding the lease terminated in 1955. When counsel for Dr. Moser advised McNally that the lease ran until 1961, the appellant solicited an opinion from the Building Inspector that \u201cthis property may not be used for a doctor\u2019s office unless the doctor resides on the premises,\u201d but McNally took no action to officially discover whether his use did violate the zoning laws. The lessors, after an evidentiary hearing, obtained a declaratory judgment in 1955 that the lease continued and was valid until 1961. In affirming that decision this Court held that a tenant who relies on the illegality or invalidity of a lease has the burden of establishing the illegality or invalidity and may not rely upon such a contention where the doing of that, said to be forbidden, may reasonably be made legal and possible through either administrative or judicial action; that the receipt of the notice by McNally from the zoning authorities <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number>in response to his inquiry did not constitute a \u201cconstructive eviction\u201d and did not justify him in accepting the fact that such use was illegal, but that he was under an obligation to contest the right to continue his use of the office; and that he could not rely on merely a possibility of the illegality of the use, but was required to show that the impossibility of the use was a fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-5\">Judge Hammond (later Chief Judge), for this Court, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b349-6\">\u201cThe defense of the appellants, based on illegality, has two prongs. The first is that the lease was an illegal bargain when it was made because the zoning ordinances then in effect made illegal the use of the leased premises for non-resident professional offices, and second, that Zoning Ordinance No. 711, adopted in May, 1953, made the previous use illegal. There was not at the trial, and is not here, any contention that the lease does not continue until 1961 unless the appellants are right in their contention as to illegality. <em>It was they who pleaded illegality, it is they who had the duty of producing evidence to show it, and finally, it is they who had the burden of persuading the court that they had established the illegality. </em>One who relies on illegality, failure of consideration or other affirmative defenses, has imposed on him the burden of persuasion. <em>Borchard, Declaratory Judgments, </em>2nd Ed., p. 405-9. <em>Shedlinsky v.

This is so because, as we have noted, it was not contemplated by the parties that there would be any impossibility or frustration and the tenants did not bind themselves to pay rent regardless of any such happening, although they could bindingly have done so, since the bargain would not have been against public policy or public morals. <em>Restatement, Contracts, </em>Sec. 458, and see also, Sec. 456, Comment (c), Ullus. 2, and Sec. 457. The principles of the Restatement have been variously applied in the following cases: <em>Wischhusen v. Spirits Co., </em>163 Md. 565, 572 <em>et seq.; Fast Bearing Co. v. Precision Development Co., </em>185 Md. 288, 307 <em>et seq.; State v. Dashiell, </em>195 Md. 677, 689 <em>et seq.; Baltimore Luggage Co. v. Ligon, </em>208 Md. 406, 417 <em>et seq.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-9\">It was the appellants who asserted that they had been relieved of their liability under the lease and who had the burden of persuading the court that Ordinance No. 711 of 1953 produced the result that they claim \u2014 that the use of the leased premises for a professional office was impossible in fact. The appellants offered neither witnesses nor other evidence requiring such a finding. . . .\u201d 210 Md. at 135-36, 122 A. 2d at 559-60.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b350-10\">After pointing out that \u201cIt could not be said in any case, until the [zoning] board had acted, and then the courts, on appeal had acted, whether or not a particular residential premise could or could not be used . . . .\u201d the Court stated further:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b350-11\">\u201cWe think that Dr. McNally, . . . could not stand idly by and, because of a notice to that effect from an administrative official, gladly accept as a fact that his use of the office was illegal. Before he can say that the use of the premises as professional <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>offices by him was impossible, he was under an obligation, ... to establish a right to continue that use, or at least to wait until impossibility became a fact, not a mere possibility.\u201d 210 Md. at 137, 122 A. 2d at 561.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">Citing with approval the holdings in <em>Shedlinsky v. Budweiser Brewing Co., </em>163 N. Y. 437, 57 N. E. 620 (1900), the Court concluded that one may not rely on invalidity where the doing of that which is said to be forbidden may reasonably be made legal and possible through either administrative or judicial action.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">Although in <em>McNally </em>the appellant \u201cstood idly by\u201d and accepted a notice from the Building Inspector as a fact that his use of the office was illegal in support of his position of \u201cimpossibility of performance,\u201d we see no valid reason why those same legal principles are not here applicable to St. Luke\u2019s since it equally \u201cstood idly by\u201d upon the opinion of its attorney that its contemplated use of the premises would be in contravention of the restrictive covenant. Thus, St. Luke\u2019s, like McNally, not having challenged the <em>ex parte </em>injunction, relied upon a \u201cmere possibility\u201d of the illegality of its use and did not fulfill its obligation in establishing, by litigation, the fact of the impossibility of its contemplated use.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">In accord with the view that prevention of the use of the premises for the purpose contemplated by the lease may serve to excuse performance, but that the one asserting the defense must prove the existence of that prohibition, <em>see </em>49 Am.Jur.2d <em>Landlord and Tenant </em>\u00a7 269 (1970). <em>See </em>generally Annot., <em>Contract-Performance-Impossibility, </em>84 A.L.R.2d 12 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">The appellant\u2019s citation of <em>Perry v. County Board of Appeals, </em>211 Md. 294, 127 A. 2d 507 (1956), for the proposition that the lease became \u201cvoidable\u201d upon service of the \u201cinjunctive order\u201d seems to be misplaced. In <em>Perry </em>this Court, in affirming the action of the Board of Appeals for Montgomery County when it granted a special exception for the operation of a \u201ccare home\u201d on property zoned residential <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>and located in Section 3 of the Village of Chevy Chase, held that the Board had properly made its determination under the zoning ordinance without reference to restrictive covenants binding the land. Rejecting the contention that the Board had no authority to grant a use of land that would violate restrictive covenants binding the land, Judge Hammond, who delivered the opinion for the Court, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-5\">\u201cMontgomery County Code, 1955, Chap. 107, Sec. 4, provides that the zoning ordinance shall not be deemed to interfere with or abrogate or annul, or otherwise affect, any covenants or other agreements between parties. This part of the zoning ordinance does not say, nor should it be taken to mean, that the rest of the ordinance must not be administered and decisions made under it, solely on the basis of its own provisions. The ordinance does not override or defeat whatever private rights exist and are legally enforceable, but neither is it controlled in its workings or effects by such rights. The enforcement of restrictive covenants is a matter for the exercise of the discretion of an equity court in the light of attendant circumstances. Many times the covenant relied on may not have been originally effective or for many reasons, may have ceased to be effective at the time relief is sought.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-7\">'Such private restrictions controlled by contract and real estate law are entirely independent of zoning and have no proper place in proceedings of this character, notwithstanding if in a proper proceeding the restrictions contended for are shown to be binding upon the properties mentioned, zoning cannot nullify them.\u2019 We hold that the Board of Appeals was right in making its determination without reference to the restrictive covenants. Neither its action nor our approval of that action would have any effect on the decision in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>a proceeding in equity to enforce the covenant.\u201d 211 Md. at 299-300, 127 A. 2d at 509.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">Although the holdings in <em>Perry, supra, </em>might be considered as authority for the proposition that had a \u201cspecial exception\u201d been granted to St. Luke\u2019s such zoning action would have no effect upon the enforcement of the restrictive covenant, we do not read it, as has the appellant, as holding that the issuance of the <em>ex parte </em>injunction rendered the lease \u201cvoidable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">Nor does appellant\u2019s reliance upon <em>Schwartz v. Westbrook, </em>154 F. 2d 854 (D.C. Cir. 1946) and <em>Lalekos v. Manset, </em>47 A. 2d 617 (D.C. Mun. Ct. App. 1946) change the result we reach. Both cases are cited as authority for the contention that Mrs. DiGiulian\u2019s alleged failure to inform Mrs. Henrickson and Dearden of the existence of the restrictive covenant and her failure to defend the <em>ex parte </em>injunction constituted a breach of her implied warranty of quiet enjoyment. Our reading of <em>Lalekos </em>does not establish it as authority for the proposition the appellant urges; it held that in the District of Columbia there is in every lease an implied warranty of quiet enjoyment and there may be a breach of the lease by the lessor\u2019s agreement to rent the entire premises to a tenant but only put the lessee in possession of part of the premises because the remainder was occupied by a sub-tenant under a prior lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">In <em>Schwartz </em>the defendant, as lessor, had entered into a contract with the plaintiff to construct for the plaintiff a restaurant building and to lease it to him for a ten-year period. In reliance thereon the plaintiff had spent substantial funds in the purchase of equipment and fixtures to be used in the contemplated restaurant. Because of a restrictive covenant in his deed prohibiting the use of the property for any commercial purposes the defendant was unable to construct the building and deliver it to the plaintiff. In reversing the case, for a proper award of damages, the United States Court of Appeals recognized that when the defendant entered into the contract \u201che impliedly warranted his title to the property and that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>lessee would have quiet possession,\u201d and that it was not incumbent upon the plaintiff to search his lessor\u2019s title.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">Assuming, without here deciding, that the holdings in <em>Schwartz </em>would be followed by this Court in an action between lessor and lessee \u2014 although our research has disclosed no such prior decision by this Court \u2014 its holdings are factually here inapplicable since the lessee there proved \u2014 a fact which St. Luke\u2019s has not here proved \u2014 that the proposed use of the leased premises was actually factually impossible.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">Although, like the trial eourt, we may not here speculate on what the result may have been had St. Luke\u2019s undertaken to contest the issuance of the injunction, we agree, upon the record before us, that St. Luke\u2019s has failed to establish, as a matter of law, a factual \u201cimpossibility of performance\u201d under the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-7\">\n<em>Judgment of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County affirmed; appellant to pay costs.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b340-12\">.

It does not appear that Mrs. DiGiulian, a resident of the District of Columbia, was ever served with the injunction; she first was aware of it when she received the letter from St. Luke\u2019s attorney demanding the return of $1,600.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b347-7\">. In Chevy Chase Village v. Jaggers, 261 Md. 309, 275 A. 2d 167 (1971), Jaggers, a physician, in 1954 without any objections being raised by the residents of Chevy Chase Village, obtained a special zoning exception to operate a physician\u2019s office in his residence in that Village. When the Jaggers moved to Potomac in 1967 they rented their home as a residence but Dr. Jaggers continued to maintain a medical office in the home. Chevy Chase Village instituted injunction proceedings to enforce a covenant running with the land, which prohibited the conduct of a trade or business in \u201cSection 1-A, Chevy Chase.\u201d This Court, holding that the restrictive covenants ran with the land and could be neither abrogated nor enlarged by zoning regulations, found that there had not been a waiver of the restrictions by a failure to object when the \u201cspecial exception\u201d had been granted Jaggers; and, contrary to the findings of the trial court, concluded that there had been no abandonment or failure of the original plan of development by substantial changes in the neighborhood so as to vitiate the covenant and render it unenforceable. Reversing the lower court Jaggers was enjoined from using the property for the practice of medicine unless he actually was a resident upon the premises.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b348-6\">. The trial court also found that St. Luke\u2019s had failed to file the petition for special exception, <em>see </em>Barnes v. Euster, 240 Md. 603, 214 A. 2d 807 (1965), but we do not see that issue as critical since under Addendum #1 the tenant had until April 1, 1972 to secure such a permit.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
