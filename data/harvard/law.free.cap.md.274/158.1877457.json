(Giant) and comes as a sequel to <em>Giant of Maryland, Inc. v. State\u2019s Attorney for Prince George\u2019s County, </em>267 Md. 501, 298 A. 2d 427, <em>appeal dismissed, </em>412 U. S. 915 (1973). On Giant\u2019s first visit to this Court we sustained the constitutionality of Maryland Code (1957, 1971 Repl. Vol.) Art. 27, \u00a7 534H, found that Giant was not within the \u201csmall business\u201d exemption provided in \u00a7 534H (c) 3, nor did it come within the exemptions provided for \u201cdrug stores,\u201d \u201cdelicatessens\u201d or \u201cbakeries and bake shops,\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 534H (b). In vacating an order which enjoined Giant \u201cfrom conducting business on Sunday with more than six employees at any given time in any one store in Prince George\u2019s County\u201d we remanded the case for the entry of a decree enjoining Giant from violating the provisions of Art. 27, \u00a7 534H, and such a decree was entered on February 20, 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-8\">On Sunday, December 16, 1973, Giant conducted an \u201cAssociates Day\u201d in the department store portion of its large <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>supermarket located in the Free State Mall in Bowie, Maryland, where it permitted its employees and members of their families to purchase merchandise at discount. The State\u2019s Attorney petitioned the court to hold Giant in contempt for violating the decree. After a hearing, the Chancellor (Taylor, J.) found that Giant had operated the department store \u201cin their usual manner\u201d and that the extension of shopping privileges to the families of Giant employees, including sisters-in-law, brothers-in-law and mothers-in-law, was tantamount to an operation of the establishment \u201cfor the general public.\u201d In its oral opinion the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-5\">\u201cI can appreciate that people working in commercial establishments such as Giant would seldom have an opportunity during Christmas and Easter seasons to shop with his or her family, but I do believe that there is a violation of the statute.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-6\">They were doing business for labor or profit in the usual manner and location. The scale was not as great as that of other days and there were some areas of the store not operating, but certainly the department store was operating in \u2018their usual manner\u2019; but it certainly does not seem to have been a flagrant violation of the statute. As a matter of fact, efforts were made to restrict participation in Associates Day to Giant employees or their families, and were it limited to Giant employees only I might be compelled to take a different view of the case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-7\">When the privilege to shop on Associates Day was extended to sisters-in-law, brothers-in-law, mothers-in-law, as testified by Mr. Sisson, then Giant offered to operate and operated its establishment for the general public.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-8\">From an adjudication that Giant was guilty of contempt and a fine of $100, an appeal was seasonably filed to the Court of Special Appeals. <em>See </em>Code (1974), Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article \u00a7 12-304. While the case was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>pending in the Court of Special Appeals we issued a writ of certiorari to that court. <em>See </em>Code (1974), Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article \u00a7 12-203.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">In its appeal Giant contends that the evidence offered in the trial court failed to establish that it conducted business on December 16, 1973, \u201cin the usual manner,\u201d nor did it operate its establishment \u201cin any manner for the general public,\u201d in violation of Art. 27, \u00a7 534H and that the evidence additionally failed to establish any intent on its part to violate the injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">In the trial court evidence was offered, in support of the petition for contempt, that an employee of Peebles Department Store, a competitor of the appellant in Bowie, at about 11 A.M. on December 16th was able to gain entrance to the store and made a single purchase of a pair of socks for seventy-nine cents. The witness acknowledged that two persons who had approached the entrance to the store in front of him were there confronted by a uniformed guard and upon acknowledgment that they were not employees of Giant were turned away by the guard, who told them that \u201cthis is for employees only shopping.\u201d Notwithstanding the witness\u2019s awareness of the restriction to employees for admission, he was able to evade the guard and gain entrance without being questioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">A special investigator in the employ of the State\u2019s Attorney, upon the receipt of a complaint from an anonymous clergyman, visited the mall at about 2:50 P.M. that Sunday to verify the pastor\u2019s complaint, ks he approached the entrance to the store from the mall he noticed six cashiers operating the cash registers. Entering, without confrontation \u2014 although he acknowledged that he was \u201cwell known\u201d in the area \u2014 he sought out the store manager. During his visit to the premises \u2014 not lasting more than five minutes \u2014\u2022 and in a dialogue with the manager, he made inquiry concerning the manager\u2019s awareness of the existence of the injunction, obtained a roster of the employees there on duty and observed what appeared to him to be the conduct of business by the cashiers in a normal manner. Although the witness did not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>recall seeing any posted signs restricting the patronage, he acknowledged that he was \u201cnot looking for any particular signs.\u201d The witness conceded that it was \u201cpossible\u201d that the manager told him that \u201cthe store was open for employees only,\u201d and disclosed that he had also received a complaint that the store was open on Sunday, December 2nd, but did not pursue it because it was open \u201cfor employees only\u201d on that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">Uncontradicted testimony was offered by a vice-president and counsel for the appellant that beginning in 1964 Giant instituted an \u201cAssociates Day\u201d in order to give its employees \u2014 both before Easter and before Christmas \u2014 an opportunity on a special day to do their holiday shopping with members of their families and to purchase, at discount, department store type goods sold by their employer. Employees of its various stores in the metropolitan area were given notice of such private shopping days by letters addressed to them, as well as by bulletins posted in the \u201cemployees only\u201d area of the respective stores. When such an \u201cAssociates Day\u201d was first scheduled in Prince George\u2019s County, after the opening of that store in the Free State Mall in 1968, the witness consulted the State\u2019s Attorney seeking assurance that such an operation would not be in violation of the statute. Although the State\u2019s Attorney advised him that \u201cif it was an employees\u2019 or Associates Day, not open to the public that they would not take any action,\u201d he further advised that if complaints were received they would be required to \u201clook into the situation with a closer analysis,\u201d and Giant would be advised of any such complaint. No complaint concerning the conduct of \u201cAssociates Day\u201d was received from the State\u2019s Attorney in the intervening five year period. There was also testimony that the appellant regularly ran advertisements in the District of Columbia newspapers, soliciting the general public to purchase food and appliances on sale during the week and on which there was a legend announcing that the stores were \u201cOpen Monday through Friday from 9 A.M. to Midnight.\u201d The only announcement for Sunday, December 16th, was that promulgated directly to Giant employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>The testimony of the general manager of the department store unit was similarly uncontradicted. Through his testimony it was elicited that Sunday, December 16th, was chosen \u2014 nine days before Christmas \u2014 to permit the employees and members of their families \u2014 which included \u201cbrothers, sisters, grandparents, brothers-in-law, sisters-in-law\u201d <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u2014 to be able to shop at a discount in an atmosphere devoid of crowding by the general public; that on the date in question, to give notice to the public, printed posters stating: \u201cSORRY! THIS IS A GIANT FAMILY PRIVATE PARTY. THANK YOU\u201d were affixed on the only unlocked door into the mall in use that day, on both the right and left of the entrance to the store from the mall and on the exterior of an emergency exit facing High\u2019s Dairy Store, which is open on Sunday, to so inform the patrons of High\u2019s. Special guards were stationed at the entrance to the store and at the \u201ccustomer pickup\u201d area in the rear, to turn away any members of the general public seeking to enter. Just for the occasion Giant hired a costumed Santa Claus with whom the invitees might have their photograph taken; a portable television set was awarded an employee as a result of a drawing held for those in attendance.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Both the manager and assistant manager served that Sunday without compensation; their duties were \u201cto1 socialize\u201d with the employees, many of whom, personally known to the general manager, were greeted at the door; many who shopped were recognized by him. In addition to the special guards, he turned away members of the general public undertaking to enter the store by advising them that a \u201cprivate party\u201d was in progress and asked them to \u201cplease come back on Monday.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">The general manager was explicit in his testimony that in his dialogue with the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s investigator he told him he was familiar with the statute and advised him that \u201cthis is a private party for Giant associates only.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>By way of comparison with the usual conduct of business the general manager explained that on a normal business day the department store sector is manned by a staff of approximately 170 employees, whereas, on the date in question, 42 employees were assigned to duty during the interval the department was open, with no more than 30 employees at any one time actually working. On the date in question 687 transactions were reflected through the cash registers, whereas, on the preceding Saturday over 4,000 such transactions were recorded, and that the total sales on that Sunday were computed to amount to approximately twenty-five percent of the usual Saturday receipts. Although the supermarket from Monday through Saturday is open from 9 A.M. until midnight, the limited hours for \u201cAssociates Day\u201d were 10 A.M. to 6 P.M. Testimony was further elicited that the food center portion of the store, usually also open during the business week, was closed; that no merchandise was received at the premises, nor were any items stocked upon the shelves, as customarily occurs from Monday through Saturday. In possible explanation of the ability of the witness to have made a seventy-nine cent purchase without his identity being learned by the cashier who \u201crung up\u201d his sale, the manager testified that for the purchasers to avail themselves of the ten percent discount it was necessary to fill out a card listing name, address, Social Security number and place of employment, which was then \u201cvalidated\u201d and ten percent deducted from the total sale; that the discount was not offered to persons making a purchase of less than two dollars unless it was specifically requested, and in such an event the employee was required to specifically request the form from the cashier and complete it.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">The pertinent portion of Art. 27, \u00a7 534H here in issue reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>\u201c(a) In Prince George\u2019s County, except as specifically in this section otherwise provided, it is unlawful on Sunday for any wholesale or retail establishment to conduct business for labor or profit <em>in the usual manner and location or </em>to operate its establishment <em>in any manner for the general public. </em>It shall not cause, direct, permit, or authorize any employee or agent to engage in or conduct business on its behalf on Sunday.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-6\">In addition to the right of the State\u2019s Attorney to petition for injunctive relief, as provided in subsection (i), subsection (j) makes any violation of the section a misdemeanor subject to punishment by a fine not exceeding $1,000 \u201cfor each employee caused, directed, permitted or authorized to work\u201d in violat\u2019^n of the section.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">In com \u00bfruing \u00a7 534H Chief Judge Murphy, for the Court, in <em>Giant of Maryland, Inc. v. State\u2019s Attorney for Prince George\u2019s County, supra, </em>stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-8\">\u201cWe must, of course, construe the statute according to the ordinary and natural import of its language; it is the language used in the statute which constitutes the primary source for determining the legislative intent. <em>Atlantic, Gulf v. Dep\u2019t of Assess. </em>&amp; <em>T., </em>252 Md. 173, 249 A. 2d 180 (1969); <em>Maryland Medical Service v. Carver, </em>238 Md. 466, 209 A. 2d 582 (1965); <em>Height v. State, </em>225 Md. 251, 170 A. 2d 212 (1961). Consequently, we cannot disregard the natural import of statutory language unless some imperative reason is found in the statute for enlarging or restricting its meaning. <em>Hunt v. Montgomery County, </em>248 Md. 403, 237 A. 2d 35 (1968); <em>Celanese Corporation v. Davis, </em>186 Md. 463, 47 A. 2d 379 (1946). We thus confine ourselves to the construction of the language of \u00a7 534H as written and we will not supply omissions or insert exemptions not made by the Legislature. <em>Birmingham v. Board of Public Works, </em>249 Md. 443, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>239 A. 2d 923 (1968); <em>Amalgamated Ins. v. Helms, </em>239 Md. 529, 212 A. 2d 311 (1965). In other words, where statutory language is plain and free from ambiguity, and expresses a definite and sensible meaning, courts are not at liberty to insert or delete words with a view toward making the statute express an intention which is different from its plain meaning. <em>Gatewood v. State, </em>244 Md. 609, 224 A. 2d 677 (1966); <em>Fowel v. State, </em>206 Md. 101, 110 A. 2d 524 (1955); <em>Pressman v. State Tax Commission, </em>204 Md. 78, 102 A. 2d 821 (1954).\u201d 267 Md. at 511-12, 298 A. 2d at 433.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b189-10\">\u201cUsual\u201d is defined in Webster\u2019s New International Dictionary of the English Language, at 2807 (2d ed. 1944) as \u201c[s]uch as in common use; such as occurs in ordinary practice, or in the ordinary course of events; customary; ordinary; habitual, common. . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b189-11\">As we read the first sentence in Art. 27, \u00a7 534H (a), the Legislature intended to prohibit, in Prince George\u2019s County, on Sundays, the conduct of business, by labor or profit, of any wholesale or retail establishment at the location and in the manner in which it was customarily, normally and commonly conducted on days other than Sunday, and proscribed as well its operation in any manner on a Sunday by which it was available for patronage by the public at large.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-12\">Nor do we read the second sentence in the section as prohibiting separate and distinct conduct from that proscribed in the first sentence, since when general words in a statute follow the designation of particular things or classes of subjects or persons, the general words will usually be construed to include only those things or persons of the same class or general nature as those specifically mentioned. <em>See Culotta v. Raimondi, </em>251 Md. 384, 387, 247 A. 2d 519, 521 (1968); <em>State Ins. Comm\u2019r v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., </em>241 Md. 108, 115, 215 A. 2d 749, 753 (1966); <em>Smith v. Higinbothom, </em>187 Md. 115, 130, 48 A. 2d 754, 761-62 (1946). This rule is applied more strictly in the construction of penal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>statutes \u2014 as is Art. 27, \u00a7 534H \u2014 since penal statutes shall be narrowly construed. <em>Smith v. Higinbothom, supra; State v. Fleming, </em>173 Md. 192, 196, 195 A. 392, 393 (1937). As we read it, the second sentence relates to and qualifies the conduct proscribed in the first sentence and cannot be construed as extending or including other conduct. <em>See Webb v. City of Baltimore, </em>179 Md. 407, 409, 19 A. 2d 704, 705 (1941); <em>Continental Oil Co. v. Horsey, </em>175 Md. 609, 612-13, 3 A. 2d 476, 477-78 (1939). <em>See also Larkins v. State, </em>163 Md. 372, 376-77, 163 A. 195, 197 (1932). <em>Compare, Blake v. State, </em>210 Md. 459, 462-63, 124 A. 2d 273, 274 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">As we interpret it, the second sentence is a corollary to the penalty provision set forth in subsection (j) of the statute and is intended to mean that no wholesale or retail establishment shall cause, direct or permit [its] employee or agent to engage in or conduct business on its behalf on Sunday \u2014 \u201cin the usual manner and location\u201d or \u201cin any manner for the general public.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">In <em>State v. Roll, </em>267 Md. 714, 298 A. 2d 867 (1973), Judge Digges, for the Court, in pointing out the distinction between civil and criminal contempts, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b190-7\">\u201c[I]n this State, the distinction between the two types of contempt has been preserved and is important. A civil contempt proceeding is intended to preserve and enforce the rights of private parties to a suit and to compel obedience to orders and decrees primarily made to benefit such parties. These proceedings are generally remedial in nature and are intended to coerce future compliance. Thus, a penalty in a civil contempt must provide for purging. On the other hand, the penalty imposed in a criminal contempt is punishment for past misconduct which may not necessarily be capable of remedy. Therefore, such a penalty does not require a purging provision but may be purely punitive. In this State, to these factors must be added the degree of proof required to establish a contempt \u2014 a civil contempt need be proved only by a preponderance of the evidence, while a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>criminal contempt must be shown beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>Winter v. Crowley, </em>245 Md. 313, 226 A. 2d 304 (1967); <em>Donner v. Calvert Distillers Corp., </em>196 Md. 475, 77 A. 2d 305 (1950).\" 267 Md. at 728, 298 A. 2d at 876.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-7\">Judge Barnes, who delivered the opinion for this Court in <em>Winter v. </em>Crowley, 245 Md. 313, 226 A. 2d 304 (1967), delineated the five factors which generally point to a civil contempt as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b191-8\">\u201c(1) the complainant is usually a private person as opposed to the State; (2) the contempt proceeding is entitled in the original action and filed as a continuation thereof as opposed to- a separate and independent action; (3) holding the defendant in contempt affords relief to a private party; (4) the relief requested is primarily for the benefit of the complainant; (5) the acts complained of do. not of themselves constitute crimes or conduct by the defendant so wilful or contumelious that the court is impelled to act on its own motion. . . .\u2019\u2019 245 Md. at 317, 226 A. 2d at 307.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b191-9\">Pursuant to Maryland Rule P4 the State\u2019s. Attorney instituted the proceedings against Giant to- have it adjudged guilty of violating, the injunction entered on February 20, 1973, and for a punitive punishment. <em>See\u2022 </em>Maryland RuleRB80 a. The proceedings were thus for an adjudication, of constructive criminal contempt, and required a proof' beyond a reasonable doubt. The Appellee so concedes..</p>\n<p id=\"b191-10\">This Court, in <em>Ex Parte Bowles, </em>164 Md. 318, 165 A. 169 (1933), held that one who has been shown guilty of contempt cannot relieve himself from liability therefor by denying an intention to commit contempt. Bowles,, the plaintiff in a slander suit, filed a motion for its removal or for the disqualification of the trial judge; asserting: in an accompanying, affidavit that the. judge\u2019s, son was. opposing counsel, that the defendant was the father-in-law of the judge\u2019s son, that the judge had aided the son \u201cin contesting <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>the plaintiffs right to intervene [in the case]\u201d and that it was his belief, confirmed by many members of the local Bar, that he could not receive \u201ca fair and impartial trial in any matter in which\u201d the judge\u2019s son and the son\u2019s father-in-law were involved before the trial judge. When the matter was heard, before another judge in the Circuit, upon a citation for contempt of court, Bowles, by answer and in testimony, disclaimed any contemptuous intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">Without discussing whether the nature of the contempt was direct or constructive, civil or criminal, our predecessors, speaking through Judge W. Mitchell Digges, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APX\">\u201cThe appellant contends that he had no intention of committing contempt, and that his denial of that intention in the answer frees him from the responsibility for his act. In such cases one must be held to intend what he does, and the language indicating that intention be construed according to its usual ordinary import. It can never be that one could be guilty of acts which constitute contempt, and subsequently relieve himself by saying that, \u2018although it was contempt, I did not intend it.,\u2019 The only legitimate effect of a subsequent denial of intention, if such denial be sincere and <em>bona fide, </em>is to mitigate the punishment.\u201d (Citations omitted.) 164 Md. at 333, 165 A. at 175.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b192-9\"><em>See Freedman v. State, </em>176 Md. 511, 515, 6 A. 2d 249, 251 (1939), quoting from <em>Ex Parte Bowles, supra, </em>but holding that denying an intention .improperly to influence the court [by a letter written about a pending case] does not have the effect of purging the contempt if the letter, on its face, by fair and ordinary import, is contemptuous.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-10\"><em>Donner v. Calvert Distillers Corp., </em>196 Md. 475, 77 A. 2d 305 (1950), involved an appeal by two brothers who operated a cut rate liquor store from an adjudication of criminal contempt for violating the terms of a decree which enjoined them from selling the products of Calvert Distillers at prices lower than those established under the Fair Trade Act. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>evidence disclosed that Joseph Donner had on two occasions sold \u201cCalvert Reserve\u201d for $3.95 per fifth, including sales tax, although the minimum price list supplied by the appellees stated that the prices listed were exclusive of taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-5\">Although the Court in its opinion did not discuss the element of intent, indirectly it seemed to apply a need for its existence for it was concluded that: \u201c[u]nder these circumstances, since Joseph Donner sold only at the price listed including the tax, and since this is a semi-criminal proceeding, we are unwilling to hold him guilty.\u201d 196 Md. at 493, 77 A. 2d at 313.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-6\">Again, in <em>Sheets v. City of Hagerstown, </em>204 Md. 113, 102 A. 2d 734 (1954), the Court, although refusing to label the contempt of which Sheets was found guilty as either civil or criminal, found the existence of intent. Sheets had been enjoined from constructing and operating a parking lot in an area zoned against such use. Thereafter Sheets obtained a permit to erect an office and service building with a driveway upon the property where he had originally contemplated a parking lot. The driveway was across the street from an A &amp; P supermarket and was being extensively used by its employees and patrons for parking. Cited for contempt for violating the injunction, Sheets undertook to show that the supermarket patrens who used the lot were trespassers, that the lot was indeed only a \u201cdriveway\u201d for which he had a permit and that signs conspicuously posted described it as being for the use of tenants. Finding that this was a \u201csmoke screen\u201d for Sheets\u2019 purpose of maintaining a parking lot despite the injunction, his conviction was sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b193-7\">Although the lower court had treated the contempt proceedings to be civil in nature, our predecessors \u201cdeem[ed] it unnecessary to label the contempt of which Sheets was found guilty, because we think that the evidence before the lower court was clear, convincing and satisfying beyond doubt that he used and maintained the lot as a parking area in <em>deliberate </em>and <em>intentional </em>defiance of the court\u2019s injunction not to do so.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) 204 Md. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>120, 102 A. 2d at 736. <em>See also Kelly v.

App. 625, 292 A. 2d 749 (1972), the Circuit Court for Howard County, prior to the scheduled trial of a celebrated arson case, issued an order prohibiting counsel in the case from making any extrajudicial statements which were, or tended to be, prejudicial to a fair trial. Thereafter the State\u2019s Attorney for Howard County made statements quoted in the press that the arson charges drawn by the State\u2019s Attorney for Dorchester County were fabricated, that the charge of inciting to riot was part of the \u201cphony indictment,\u201d which was in material part false and that he would rather be defending the case than prosecuting it. The two-judge court in adjudging Kinlein guilty of criminal contempt found \u201c \u2018beyond a reasonable doubt, and to a moral certainty, that the words that were uttered, by their common meaning, inherently and <em>on their face, </em>* * * at least tend to prejudice a fair trial in this case.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</p>\n<p id=\"b195-7\">Kinlein, not disputing the making of the statements ascribed to him, nor his knowledge of the order he was found to have violated, argued that the evidence was deficient because it did not establish an intention on his part to prejudice a fair trial. The Court of Special Appeals, in an opinion by Judge Orth (now Chief Judge of that court), concerning the issue of intent, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>\u201cWe see no merit whatsoever in the claim that the judgment must be reversed because \u2018the element of willfulness was neither alleged nor proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 Kinlein argues that the evidence had to show that he willfully attempted to prejudice a fair trial. But all that was required here was that the statements which had a reasonable likelihood of preventing a fair trial were willfully made in violation of the court\u2019s order. And this Kinlein does not dispute. Lack of intent to prejudice the fairness of the trial may go to mitigation of punishment but not to the commission of the act of contempt. See <em>Ex Parte Bowles, </em>164 Md. 318. Good faith is not determinative where, as here, the <em>act comprising the alleged contempt is plainly contemptuous on its face. Goldsborough v.

United States, </em>444 F. 2d 928 (D.C. Cir. 1971), for want of evidence of intent. The evidence established that the failure of the appellant to appear \u201cwas not by design but resulted from a lapse of memory, preoccupation with another case and confusion as to dates\u201d; he had failed to look at his-day book and was under an honest impression that he was not scheduled to appear until the following week since he had an appellate case to argue on the same date.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-6\">In a per curiam that Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b196-7\">\u201c[T]he offense of which the appellant was convicted was a criminal contempt.

The attorney, in response to a letter of inquiry from the clerk of the court, expressed a willingness to represent indigent defendants, pointed out his membership in the Bar of other jurisdictions, but advised that he was not a member of the Bar of the District Court. An employee of the clerk\u2019s office failed to note this disqualification and the attorney was appointed to represent the indigent defendant. The United States Court of Appeals, in setting aside his conviction for contempt for want of evidence of \u201ccontumacious intent,\u201d stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b197-7\">\u201c[A] degree of intentional wrongdoing is an ingredient of the offense of criminal contempt.

We think such conclusion is buttressed when, as under facts like those here, the conduct alleged to be contemptuous at the same time would constitute a misdemeanor in violation of Art 27, \u00a7 534H (j), and the penalty therein provided. <em>See Hitzelberger v. State, </em>173 Md. 435, 444, 196 A. 288, 292 (1938).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">We think the holdings in <em>United States ex rel. Porter v. Kroger Grocery </em>&amp; <em>Baking Co., </em>163 F. 2d 168 (7th Cir. 1947), are here particularly apposite. <em>Kroger, </em>by making sales of meat at a number of stores in the Chicago area in excess of the ceiling price, was adjudged in contempt of court for violating an injunction which restrained it from selling or offering to sell at prices in excess of the maximum prices established by OPA regulations. <em>Kroger, </em>by answer and at trial, did not dispute that the alleged sales had been made, but contended that they \u201cdid not intend to defy the authority of the court and did not intentionally commit the acts relied upon to prove such defiance of the injunction,\u201d and that such sales were attributable to conditions encountered in the sale of meat and meat products, as well as unintentional errors by those employees who were charged with the responsibility of determining and affixing the maximum ceiling prices. In reversing the conviction the court pointed out that the uncontradicted proof offered by <em>Kroger </em>showed, or tended to show, the good faith effort which it made to comply with the ceiling price regulations, as well as the injunction, in that store managers and meat cutters had been informed of the injunction, bulletins were from time to time issued urging employees to comply with the ceiling prices, and that it had used a shopping service to \u201cshop\u201d its stores to see if its instructions were being followed by its personnel. Noting that the principal issue was whether a denial of intent to commit contempt is a defense and that the injunction \u201cdid not enjoin the making of sales but was only directed at sales made in a certain manner, that is, at a price above the ceiling,\u201d the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-6\">\"In Wilson v. State of North Carolina, 169 U.S. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>586, 600, 18 S.Ct. 435, 42 L.Ed. 865, the court in a contempt proceeding ordered the rule discharged because the evidence failed to disclose an intentional contempt on the part of the relator. In In re Rice, C.C., 181 F. 217, 228, the court discharged a defendant charged with contempt of a court order and in doing so stated: \u2018No one can be punished for a criminal contempt unless the evidence makes it clear that he intended to commit it. To [the] doubt is to be resolved in favor of respondent.\u2019 \u201d 163 F. 2d at 173.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">After concluding that: \u201cWe are of the view that the intent with which the overcharges were made is an essential element of the contempt charged and that the burden was upon the plaintiff to establish such element beyond all reasonable doubt,\u201d the court found that there was no substantial evidence to support the finding that Kroger\u2019s conduct had been deliberate, knowing and willful.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-7\">In opposition to the testimony of the State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s investigator concerning what appeared to him to be the conduct of business \u201cin a normal manner,\u201d the evidence presented by Giant\u2019s witnesses was massive and uncontradicted as to the differences between how Giant conducted its supermarket for \u201cAssociates Day\u201d on Sunday, December 16, 1973, in contrast with the manner in which it customarily, normally and commonly conducted its business at the same location on days other than Sunday.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-8\">The fact that that portion of the store devoted to the sale of foods was closed, that announcements of the opening were limited to letters and bulletins promulgated to the employees, that the premises were open from 10 A.M. to 6 P.M., and only for Giant employees and members of their immediate families, the limited number of personnel on duty, the volunteered services of the manager and assistant manager, the employment of a costumed Santa Claus and a drawing giving away a portable television set, all compel the conclusion that the appellant was not conducting business \u201cin the usual manner and location\u201d as proscribed by the statute when it held \u201cAssociates Day\u201d on December 16,1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>Nor does the surreptitious entry by the employee of a competitor, who purchased a pair of socks without identification give rise to even an inference of evidence that the appellant \u201coperated its establishment in any manner for the general public,\u201d equally prohibited by the statute, in view of the uncontradicted evidence concerning the signs affixed, as well as the guards posted at the entrances to turn away members of the general public and the admitted evidence that such patrons were denied entry. We think the finding by the Chancellor was overstrained when he found that the privilege extended to \u201csisters-in-law, brothers-in-law and mothers-in-law\u201d constituted an operation \u201cfor the general public.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b201-5\">As pointed out in <em>Kroger, supra, </em>the appellant was not under an injunction prohibiting it from operating its store on Sunday for a private sale for its employees and members of their families \u2014 the injunction was \u201cfrom <em>violating </em>the provisions of Art. 27, \u00a7 534IT.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b201-6\">These reasons alone compel a reversal, without a new trial, of the finding that the appellant violated the terms of the injunction.</p>\n<p id=\"b201-7\">Finding as we do, that the conduct of the appellant was not contemptuous on its face, we further conclude that proof of its contumacious intent, beyond a reasonable doubt, was a necessary ingredient to sustain the offense charged, since an adjudication of its guilt for criminal contempt was tantamount to a finding of its guilt of a misdemeanor under \u00a7 534H (j).</p>\n<p id=\"b201-8\">Although \u201cthe fact that failure to comply with the judicial command was based on the advice of counsel is generally held to be no justification,\u201d <em>Weaver v. State, </em>244 Md. 640, 644, 224 A. 2d 684, 687 (1966), <em>Tyler v. Baltimore County, </em>256 Md. 64, 67, 259 A. 2d 307, 309 (1969), and although advice given by a State\u2019s Attorney that a contemplated act would not be criminal has been held not to excuse an offender if, as a matter of law, the act performed would amount to a violation of the law, <em>Hopkins v. State, </em>193 Md. 489, 498, 69 A. 2d 456, 460, <em>appeal dismissed, </em>339 U. S. 940 (1950), we think that the consultation by the vice-president and counsel for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>Giant in 1968, before it commenced holding \u201cAssociates Day\u201d at its store in the Free State Mall, while not constituting a defense to a charge for criminal contempt, was evidence of a lack of contumacious intent on its part to violate the provisions of Art. 27, \u00a7 534H, when it thereafter periodically conducted \u201cAssociates Day\u201d including the one held on Sunday, December 16, 1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-4\">When the Chancellor stated that he \u201cmight be compelled to take a different view of the case\u201d if \u201cefforts were [had been] made to restrict participation in Associates Day to Giant employees or their families,\u201d we think he overlooked the uncontradicted evidence concerning the genuine and bona fide efforts made by Giant through its personnel to exclude members of the general public and to restrict participation in \u201cAssociates Day\u201d \u2014 as it did \u2014 to its employees and a limited class of their relatives.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-5\">Upon our review of both the facts and the law we additionally find that no evidence was offered from which it could be found that the appellant possessed the requisite intent to violate the injunctive decree of February 20,1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-6\">We conclude, upon the uncontradicted evidence offered in the trial court that its decision was clearly erroneous and the judgment imposed must be set aside.
