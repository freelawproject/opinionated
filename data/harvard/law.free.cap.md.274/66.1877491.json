This suspension, however, is subject specifically to the right of the respondent under Rule BV9 to seek a modification or termination of the suspension upon his being able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of this Court that he has been sufficiently rehabilitated to again be permitted to resume the practice of law in this State; and it is further</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">ORDERED, that in view of the fact that counsel for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>respondent has informed this Court that an agreement has been consummated between the respondent and Charles P. Howard, Jr., Esquire, an attorney authorized to practice law in this State, by which that attorney \u201cwill take such steps as are necessary to assure that legal matters previously entrusted to Tucker R. Dearing by his clients are properly handled so that the clients will suffer no detriment during the period when Mr. Dearing is incapacitated or may not practice law,\u201d the appointment of a conservator or rec\u00e9iver to take charge of the respondent\u2019s professional files and records for the purpose of protecting the interest of respondent\u2019s clients, will be unnecessary at this time; instead it is</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">ORDERED, that Walter E. Black, Jr., Esquire, be designated as a Special Master of this Court (with such assistance as in his judgment he may require from other members of the bar selected by him) to make inquiry as to whether the clients of the said respondent have been properly notified of the inability of the said respondent to further represent them at this time, as well as whether, with the consent of each client, proper arrangements for adequate legal representation by an attorney authorized to practice law in this State have been made, and to report to this Court his findings and conclusions as soon as he reasonably can, but, in any event, no later than thirty days from the date of this Order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
