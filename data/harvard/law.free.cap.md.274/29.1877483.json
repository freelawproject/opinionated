Upon his arraignment in that court he elected trial by jury and his case was transferred to the Criminal Court of Baltimore. <em>See </em>Maryland Code (1974), Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article \u00a7 4-302 d.</p>\n<p id=\"b52-12\">When his case came before the Criminal Court on October 18, 1973, he waived a jury trial and was tried upon the warrant<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> by Judge Robert J. Gerstung.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b52-13\">After adjudging the appellant to be guilty Judge Gerstung inquired of co.unsel as to whether or not Johnson had \u201can <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>outstanding conviction.\u201d Although the Assistant State\u2019s Attorney responded in the affirmative, the particulars thereof were not disclosed. Johnson\u2019s counsel responded that \u201capparently [there was] not.\u201d Judge Gerstung then imposed a sentence of five years, stated that he would request \u201ca post sentence report for the specific purpose of determining prior record, work habits, and drug habits,\u201d and directed counsel to file a motion for reduction of sentence. He then informed the defendant that he had the right to file a motion for a new trial within three days and that he had \u201cthirty days in which to file an appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b53-5\">When the Probation Department of the Supreme Bench of Baltimore filed the report of its post-sentence investigation on November 12th it was disclosed that the appellant had been placed on \u201cprobation without verdict\u201d in 1969 for attempted burglary, had served a three-year sentence in 1970 for assault with intent to murder \u2014 confirmed by the arrest records and fingerprints, but denied by the appellant \u2014 and had three cases charging him with gambling in 1972, on one of which he had been fined and on the other two he had been given \u201cprobation without verdict.\u201d Upon this data Judge Gerstung was apparently persuaded to reduce the sentence imposed on October 18, 1973,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and on December 28, 1973, pursuant to the provisions of Maryland Rule 764 b 1, resentenced the appellant to a four-year term which modification was entered of record upon the docket.</p>\n<p id=\"b53-6\">On January 25, 1974, an appeal was docketed to the Court of Special Appeals, and on February 22nd the Criminal Court of Baltimore (Perrott, J.), upon a petition, signed an order extending the time for the transmittal of the record until April 25, 1974. <em>See </em>Maryland Rule 1025 b. When, apparently, the record could not be transmitted within 90 days \u201cfrom the date after the first order for appeal,\u201d a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>petition filed on April 19, 1974, for a further extension of time was addressed, pursuant to Maryland Rule 1025 c, to the Court of Special Appeals. Chief Judge Orth denied the petition on April 22, 1974, marginally noting that the \u201cappeal [was] untimely filed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b54-5\">Counsel for the appellant asserting that the appeal was entered from the modified sentence and judgment imposed on December 28, 1973, petitioned the Court of Special Appeals to reconsider the order dismissing the appeal. That court on April 30,1974, noting that the motion was, in effect, to have the court rescind its prior order, denied it. The Clerk of the Court of Special Appeals by letter advised the Clerk of the Criminal Court of Baltimore, as well as the State\u2019s Attorney for Baltimore City and the Attorney General, of the action taken by the court and directed the addressees\u2019 attention to Maryland Rule 1013. On April 26, 1974, Judge Perrott, in the Criminal Court of Baltimore, noting that the appellant\u2019s attempted appeal was from the action taken on December 28,1973, reducing his sentence and was not taken within 30 days from the date of the imposition of his original sentence on October 18, 1973, dismissed the appeal pursuant to Maryland Rule 1013 \u2014 which authorizes the lower court, sua sponte, or upon motion, to strike an order for appeal where the appe'al has not been timely filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-6\">The appellant seasonably noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals from Judge Perrott\u2019s final order. <em>See </em>Code (1974), Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article \u00a7 12-301. While the case was pending in the Court of Special Appeals we granted the petition of the appellant for the issuance of a writ of certiorari. <em>See </em>Code (1974), Courts and Judicial Proceedings Article \u00a7 12-203.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-7\">Maryland Rule 1012, relating to appeals to the Court of Special Appeals, provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-8\">\u201cWhenever an appeal to this Court or an application to this Court for a writ of certiorari is permitted by law, the order for appeal or the application for a writ of certiorari shall be filed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number><em>within thirty days from the date of the judgment appealed from,. </em>\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-6\">It is substantially the same as Maryland Rule 812 a, which governed appeals to this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-7\">In <em>Colter v. State, </em>219 Md. 190, 148 A. 2d 561 (1959), it was held that the appellant\u2019s appeal must be dimissed where it was not taken, as required by Maryland Rule 812 a, within 30 days from the judgment of conviction appealed from, and that the filing of a motion for a new trial, after the entry of a judgment and the imposition of sentence did not extend the time for filing such appeal under the holdings in <em>Hayes v. State, </em>141 Md. 280, 282, 118 A. 652 (1922).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b55-8\">In <em>Coleman v. State, </em>231 Md. 220, 189 A. 2d 616 (1963), the appellant was sentenced on February 15, 1961, to a term of two years which was suspended and he was placed on probation for that same period, under specified conditions. His probation was revoked on July 11, 1962 for failure to comply with the conditions. When the trial court revoked the probation the clerk, in error, made a docket entry which read: \u201cProbation stricken out and sentenced to two (2) years in the Maryland House of Correction from July 6, 1962, Foster, Judge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b55-9\">This Court, in remanding the case for a correction of the docket entry, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-10\">\u201cWhen the sentence in a criminal case is imposed and execution of the imposed sentence is conditionally suspended, as distinguished from the suspension of the imposition of sentence, and the defendant placed on probation, and thereafter the probation is stricken out, the defendant should not be re-sentenced. His original sentence is effective with the probationary provisions stricken out. Cf. <em>Swan v. State, supra, </em>200 Md. at page 424 [90 A. 2d at 692 (1952)].\u201d 231 Md. at 222, 189 A. 2d at 618.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>Judge Prescott (later Chief Judge), who delivered the opinion concerning Coleman\u2019s appeal, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-5\">\u201c[I]t is apparent from the appellant\u2019s brief that he is not entitled to the relief he has requested. He, of course, could not appeal from the original sentence in February, 1961, as the time limited for such an appeal had long since expired. Maryland Rule 812 a. If we consider his present appeal as one from the order striking out his probation, he conceded that he had violated the conditions of his probation; hence he could obtain no assistance from this quarter. And if we consider his appeal as from the \u2018sentence\u2019 of July 11, 1962, (as he claims it is), and that \u2018sentence\u2019 is stricken out (as we have indicated above it should be by a correction of the docket entry), the original sentence is in full force and effect, which means, of course, the appellant, likewise, is entitled to no relief here.\u201d 231 Md. at 223, 189 A. 2d at 618.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-7\">In <em>Wampler v. Warden, </em>231 Md. 639, 191 A. 2d 594 (1963), in denying application to appeal under the Post Conviction Procedure Act, this Court rejected the contention that the applicant\u2019s petition for a reduction of the sentence operated as an extension of time within which an appeal might be entered. Chief Judge Bru\u00f1e, who delivered the opinion of the Court, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-8\">\u201cTo avoid possible misconception in the future, we think it advisable, however, to note our disagreement with the view of the trial court as to the time allowed for an appeal. The time is within thirty days from the judgment appealed from. Md. Rule 812. The applicant\u2019s petition for a reduction of sentence did not operate to extend the time within which an appeal might be entered. Cf. <em>Colter v. State, </em>219 Md. 190, 148 A. 2d 561, and <em>Hayes v. State, </em>141 Md. 280, 118 A. 652, holding that the filing of a motion for a new trial after judgment has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>been entered does not stop the running of the time for appeal. Similar rules apply in civil cases. We think it unnecessary to prolong this opinion further by citing authorities in such matters.\u201d 231 Md. at 652, 191 A. 2d at 602.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-6\">In <em>Blackstone v. State, </em>6 Md. App. 404, 251 A. 2d 255 (1969), the appellant filed a timely appeal to the Court of Special Appeals after the imposition of sentence. About 70 days later, in a document signed by him and his counsel, and filed with the clerk, he dismissed the appeal. Several days thereafter, pursuant to Maryland Rule 764 b 2, he filed a \u201cMotion for New Trial Based on Newly Discovered Evidence.\u201d When that motion was heard and denied and he was committed to the custody of the sheriff, he again filed in proper person a \u201cMotion for Appeal.\u201d Judge Orth (now Chief Judge), for the Court of Special Appeals, in dismissing that appeal, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-7\">\u201cIf the appellant seeks an appeal from the judgment of his convictions and sentences, Md. Rule 1012 requires that the order of appeal be filed within thirty days from the date of the judgment appealed from. Although the appellant filed a timely appeal he dismissed it and the subsequent \u2018Motion for Appeal\u2019 of 8 July was filed too late. There is no provision in the Maryland Rules or elsewhere authorizing the lower court to extend the time within which an order of appeal to this Court shall be filed. <em>Cornwell v. State, </em>1 Md. App. 576. Nor did the filing of a motion for a new trial after conviction and sentence extend the time for filing an appeal. <em>McCoy v. Warden, </em>1 Md. App. 108, quoting <em>Colter v. State, supra, </em>at 191-192 citing <em>Hayes v. State, </em>141 Md. 280, 282. See <em>Brown v. State, </em>237 Md. 492. As the appeal here was not filed within the time required, it is dismissed. [Footnote omitted.] Md. Rule 1035 \u00a7\u00a7 a 2 and b (2).\u201d 6 Md. App. at 406-07, 251 A. 2d at 256.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>Maryland Rule 764 b 1, under which Judge Gerstung acted on December 28, 1973, in revising and modifying the appellant\u2019s prior sentence, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-5\">\u201cFor a period of ninety (90) days after the imposition of a sentence, or within ninety (90) days after receipt by the court of a mandate issued by the Court of Appeals or the Court of Special Appeals upon affirmance of the judgment or dismissal of appeal, or thereafter, pursuant to motion filed within such period, the court shall have <em>revisory power and control </em>over the judgment or other judicial act forming a part of the proceedings. The court may, pursuant to this section, <em>modify or reduce, </em>but shall not increase the length of a sentence. After the expiration of such period, the court shall have such revisory power and control only in case of fraud, mistake or irregularity.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">The appellant does not here seek a review of the new judgment imposed but contends that since Maryland Rule 764 b 2, provides that upon a modification or reduction of sentence a \u201cnew judgment of conviction\u201d is entered he is now entitled to a full appellate review of the proceedings leading to his conviction. As authority for his contention he relies upon <em>Corey v. United States, </em>375 U. S. 169 (1963), where the majority held that in cases where a defendant has been sentenced under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208 (b) <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and resentenced, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>he has the option to appeal his conviction either after the entry of his original commitment under \u00a7 4208 (b), or after the second sentence imposed under that section. Mr. Justice Stewart, who delivered the opinion for the majority, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-5\">\u201c[U]nder the provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208 (b) the trial judge sentences a convicted defendant not once, but twice. The judge first imposes a sentence of imprisonment \u2018deemed to be\u2019 the <em>maximum </em>prescribed by the law, and then, after the defendant has been imprisoned for three or six months, the judge fixes a new sentence which may be quite different from the one originally imposed. The present case illustrates the problem which then arises. That problem, simply stated, is how, in cases where trial judges have utilized the sentencing provisions authorized by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208 (b), the rules governing criminal appeals are to be applied so as neither to frustrate their purpose nor to impair the efficacy of the flexible sentencing procedure which Congress devised in enacting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208 (b). We have concluded that in such cases an appeal may be taken within the time provided by Rule 37 (a)(2), Fed. Rules Crim. Proc., <em>after either the first or the second sentence under </em>\u00a7 <em>J/208 (b), at the option of the convicted defendant.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b59-8\">It would obviously contravene the basic policies of the criminal appellate rules to require a defendant sentenced under \u00a7 4208 (b) to defer his appeal until after he had submitted to the three or six months of incarceration and diagnostic study prescribed by the statute. Such a requirement would not only forestall any opportunity of a prompt appeal from an underlying criminal conviction, but would deprive a convicted defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>of the substantial right to be enlarged on bail while his appeal was pending. Indeed, the imposition of such a mandatory three- or six-month term of imprisonment before the defendant could file an appeal might raise constitutional problems of significant proportions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-5\">But we need not consider such problems, because a \u00a7 4208 (b) commitment is clearly not lacking in sufficient \u2018finality\u2019 to support an immediate appeal, and there is <em>nothing to indicate that Congress intended that the right of appeal be mandatorily suspended in cases where the provisions of </em>\u00a7 <em>4208 (b) are utilized. . . </em>.\u201d (Footnotes omitted.) (Emphasis supplied.) 375 U. S. at 172-73.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-6\">Subsection 2 of Maryland Rule 764 b, adopted by this Court on January 18, 1972, effective January 24, 1972, reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-7\">\u201c2. <em>In Open Court.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b60-8\">A modification or reduction of sentence shall be made in open court and only after notice to the defendant and the State\u2019s Attorney. <em>A new judgment of conviction, </em>setting forth the <em>revised </em>sentence and specifying the <em>modification or reduction </em>made, shall be entered of record so that the docket entries reflect the action taken.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b60-9\">In <em>Wilson v. State, </em>227 Md. 99, 175 A. 2d 775 (1961), Maryland Rule 744 a \u2014 now Rule 764 a \u2014 providing that a court may, at any time, correct an illegal sentence, was construed to be a \u201cstatutory remedy,\u201d within the meaning of what is now Maryland Code (1957, 1971 Repl. Vol.) Art. 27, \u00a7 645A (Post Conviction Procedure Act), and held that there was no direct appeal from a refusal to modify a sentence. <em>See also Harris v. State, </em>241 Md. 596, 217 A. 2d 307 (1966), where this Court dismissed an attempted direct appeal from a denial of a motion by the lower court to strike out a judgment and sentence. The dismissal was there held to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>without prejudice to the appellant for relief under the Post Conviction Procedure Act, under which \u201che might attempt to establish an evidentiary basis for the contentions made\u201d in his aborted appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">In <em>Dawson v. State, </em>17 Md. App. 316, 301 A. 2d 214 (1973), the appellant undertook to appeal from the modified sentence imposed pursuant to Maryland Rule 764 b 1 \u2014 alleging that it was an illegally increased sentence. The Court of Special Appeals, under the authority of <em>Wilson v. State, supra, </em>and <em>Harris v. State, supra, </em>held that \u201c[t]he difference [between Rule 764 a and b] is immaterial since both aspects of Maryland Rule 764 represent a \u2018statutory remedy\u2019 \u201d and dismissed the appeal, without prejudice, however, to the appellant to apply for relief under the Post Conviction Procedure Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">We find the holdings in <em>Corey v. United States, supra, </em>to be clearly distinguishable and here inapposite. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4208 is entitled \u201cFixing eligibility for parole at time of sentencing,\u201d and creates a complete statutory scheme dissimilar to our practice; we have no sentencing procedure such as that provided for by that statute. Moreover, the provisions of \u00a7 4208 (b) are peculiarly here inapplicable since a sentence initially imposed thereunder is \u201cfor the maximum sentence of imprisonment prescribed by law\u201d and Judge Gerstung, when he sentenced the appellant on October 18, 1973, did not impose the maximum sentence authorized for the offense committed by the appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-7\">Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure providing for the \u201cCorrection or Reduction of Sentence\u201d is virtually identical to the provisions of Maryland Rule 764 a and 764 b 1 (except thereunder the court has a 60 day period within which to act rather than 90 days as under our Rule), but when one undertakes to appeal, after a correction or reduction of his sentence pursuant to that Rule it has been held that such an appeal cannot be used as a vehicle to redetermine issues arising during the trial and cannot be invoked as a substitute for an appeal pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 37 a (2) (providing for the entry of an appeal within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>ten days after the entry of judgment); such appeals are limited to whether or not the District judge had abused his discretion in imposing the corrected sentence or in denying a motion to reduce the sentence. <em>See United States v. Sternman, </em>433 F. 2d 913 (6th Cir. 1970); <em>Funkhouser v. United States, </em>260 F. 2d 86 (4th Cir. 1958), <em>cert. denied, </em>358 U. S. 940 (1959). <em>See also Poole v. United States, </em>250 F.2d 396 (D.C. Cir. 1957). <em>Compare Wilson v. State, supra; Harris v. State, supra; </em>and <em>Dawson v. State, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">The history of Maryland Rule 764 b and its predecessors (Maryland Rule 744 b and Rule 10 c Pt. 4 of the General Rules of Practice and Procedure) does not support the interpretation sought by the appellant. As observed in <em>Pearlman v. State, </em>226 Md. 67, 71, 172 A. 2d 395, 397 (1961), before the enactment of Chapter 506 of the Acts of 1892 appeals in criminal cases were entered before the imposition of sentence. <em>Pearlman, </em>notwithstanding the provisions then in Maryland Code (1957) Art. 5, \u00a7 12 (Ch. 399 of the Acts of 1957), undertaking to grant a right of appeal \u201cfrom any conviction or sentence,\u201d adhered to the tradition of appealability when a judgment has been entered \u2014 or from any conviction where sentence has been suspended. Former Rule 10 e Pt. 4 G.R.P.P. provided for the modification of a sentence, within a 90 day period, to ameliorate the harshness of the former practice which held that the jurisdiction of the trial court to modify a sentence expired after the Term in which the judgment had been entered. <em>See Madison v. State, </em>205 Md. 425, 434, 109 A. 2d 96, 100 (1954).</p>\n<p id=\"b62-6\">When this Court on January 18, 1972, adopted subsection 2 of Maryland Rule 764 b, it readopted the other sections of the Rule then in effect.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This revision was in direct response to a practice which had arisen from time to time on the part of some of the trial judges in the state whereby sentences earlier imposed were being modified at the behest of counsel for the defendant in <em>ex parte </em>proceedings conducted in chambers which resulted in merely a direction to the clerks <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>to issue new commitments under Maryland Rule 763, or orders of suspension of sentence. It was the clear intention of the new subsection that all proceedings leading to a modification or a reduction of sentence be conducted \u201cin open court\u201d and \u201cafter notice to the defendant and the State\u2019s Attorney.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Although the phrase \u201ca <em>new </em>judgment of conviction\u201d may have been imprecise, it is clear from a reading of the section, and its interrelation to Maryland Rule 764 b 1, that it pertains merely to the entry of a \u201cmodified\u201d or \u201creduced\u201d revised judgment and not to the entry of a wholly new judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">The meaning of a Rule \u201cdoes not depend upon the niceties of definition but upon the reasonable intendment of the language used in the light of the purpose to be effectuated,\u201d <em>Brown v. State, </em>237 Md. 492, 504, 207 A. 2d 103, 111 (1965), citing <em>Shub v. Simpson, </em>196 Md. 177, 191, 76 A. 2d 332, 337-38 (1950), and <em>Darnall v. Connor, </em>161 Md. 210, 214-16, 155 A. 894, 896-97 (1931); and the Maryland Rules, like statutes, when dealing with the same subject matter will be construed so as to harmonize with each other and not produce an unreasonable result. <em>See Baltimore Transit Co. v. Mezzanotti, </em>227 Md. 8, 19-20, 174 A. 2d 768, 774 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-7\">Contrary to the holdings in <em>Corey, </em>that there was \u201cnothing to indicate that Congress intended that the right of appeal be mandatorily suspended in cases where the provisions of \u00a7 4208 (b) are utilized,\u201d we find from the history of Maryland Rule 764 and its predecessors, from the object sought to be obtained by the adoption of Maryland Rule 764 b 2, and its harmonization with Maryland Rule 1012, that there was no intent to engraft upon the provisions of Rule 1012, requiring the entry of an appeal \u201cwithin 30 days from the date of the judgment,\u201d an additional period of 90 days within which a defendant has the right to file with the trial court for a modification or reduction of the sentence imposed. To hold otherwise would permit such an appeal even upon the denial of such modification or reduction and would be completely contrary to our holdings in <em>Wampler v. Warden, supra, </em>and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>the rationale of the holdings in <em>Colter v. State, supra; Coleman v. State, supra; </em>and <em>Harris v. State, supra. </em>This view is buttressed by the provisions in Maryland Code (1957, 1974 Cum. Supp.) Art. 27, \u00a7 645JD, which provides that where an application for review of sentence is made, before a panel of three judges under the Review of Criminal Sentences Act, the application for review of a sentence \u201cshall not in any way affect the time allowed for filing an appeal on the merits of the case. ...\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b64-5\">As the Supreme Court in <em>Corey </em>recognized:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b64-6\">\u201cIn the ordinary criminal case, where the imposition of a sentence follows promptly upon a determination of guilt, no problem arises in the application of these appellate rules or in the effectuation of the policies which they reflect. An appeal may not be taken until after the pronouncement of sentence, and <em>must be taken promptly after sentence is imposed. </em>\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) 375 U. S. at 172.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b64-7\">For these reasons we shall affirm the order of the Criminal Court of Baltimore under Maryland Rule 1013 which dismissed the appellant\u2019s appeal as not having been timely filed, under Maryland Rule 1012, from the judgment imposed on October 18,1973.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-8\">Collaterally, the appellant, \u201c[ajssuming, without conceding, that the \u2018new judgment\u2019 language of Rule 764 b 2, has no implications for appeal deadlines,\u201d nonetheless contends that to now deny him appellate review would amount to a denial of procedural \u201cdue process\u201d since he \u201creasonably relied upon an ambiguous court rule.\u201d His reliance upon <em>Schaedler v. Warden, </em>1 Md. App. 25, 226 A. 2d 684 (1967) and <em>Lloyd v. Warden, </em>229 F. Supp. 364 (D. Md. 1964), in support of this contention is misplaced. <em>Schaedler </em>and <em>Lloyd </em>respectively involved a clerical error by the clerk in filing an appeal in the wrong case, and in a failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>seasonably docket an appeal upon a letter from the court clerk which was both erroneous and ambiguous, entitling the petitioners to a belated appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">The simple and concise answer to this contention is that this Court \u201cwill not ordinarily decide any point or question which does not plainly appear by the record to have been tried and decided by the lower court\u201d; Maryland Rule 885; see <em>Brice v. State, </em>254 Md. 655, 255 A. 2d 28 (1969); <em>Rose v. State, </em>240 Md. 65, 212 A. 2d 742 (1965); <em>Kares v. State, </em>215 Md. 396, 137 A. 2d 712 (1958); nor can we invade the province of the trial court by making an original factual finding. <em>See Hartley v. State, </em>238 Md. 165, 208 A. 2d 72 (1965). <em>See also Martin v. State, </em>203 Md. 66, 98 A. 2d 8 (1953), where this Court would not pass upon the question concerning the validity of a statute which was not raised in the lower court.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-6\">Although we have held that the erroneous advice given by counsel, or any misunderstanding between the defendant and his trial counsel with regard to the entry of an appeal are not in themselves sufficient to order a belated appeal by granting relief under the Post Conviction Procedure Act; <em>see Lipscomb v. Warden, </em>223 Md. 640, 162 A. 2d 447 (1960); <em>McCoy v. Warden, </em>1 Md. App. 108, 227 A. 2d 375 (1967); we have recognized that a petitioner might be entitled to a belated appeal, under some circumstances, as a remedy to insure unto him as full a review as if he had entered an appeal. <em>See State v. Brown, </em>235 Md. 401, 407, 201 A. 2d 852, 855 (1964), <em>cert. denied, </em>379 U. S. 978 (1965). Here the appellant baldly asserts that he \u201creasonably relied upon an ambiguous court rule\u201d without any record to support the basis for such assertion. In order to properly pass upon such contention there should be evidence concerning what the petitioner may have been told concerning his appeal rights by his trial counsel, or whether he personally intended to, or wished to, enter an appeal, or if he was even aware of the provisions of Maryland Rule 764 b 2. Significantly, it must be noted that at the time of the imposition of sentence on October 18, 1973, he was unmistakably advised by Judge Gerstung that \u201che has thirty days in which to file an appeal.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>Since we have held, in <em>Wilson v. State, supra, </em>and in <em>Harris v. State, supra, </em>and the Court of Special Appeals has held, in <em>Dawson v. State, supra, </em>that the provisions of Maryland Rule 764 a and b 1, are each construed to be a \u201cstatutory remedy\u201d within the meaning of the Post Conviction Procedure Act, our decision here, affirming the dismissal of his appeal, is without prejudice to the appellant to seek a belated appeal under the Post Conviction Procedure Act in proceedings under which \u201che might attempt to establish an evidentiary basis for the [secondary] contention made.\u201d <em>See Harris v.
