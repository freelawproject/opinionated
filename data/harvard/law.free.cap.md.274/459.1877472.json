Barrick presiding) of \u201cmaintaining a common nuisance\u201d in violation of Maryland Code (1957, 1971 Repl. Vol.) Art. 27, \u00a7 286 (a)(5).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> He also was convicted of possession of a controlled dangerous substance \u2014 marijuana \u2014 in violation of Art. 27, \u00a7 287 (a).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b483-10\">Admitted into evidence at his trial were approximately 200 items, including various types of pipes for smoking marijuana, numerous scales, weights, eyedroppers, gelatin capsules and \u201cBaggies,\u201d measuring spoons and syringes, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>hypodermic needles, wire screens, homemade cookers, a quantity of marijuana, 78 growing marijuana plants, an assortment of colored pills, cigarette papers and two twenty dollar bills in an envelope, as well as cherry incense and incense candles. These items were seized on May 19, 1972, from the various bedrooms occupied by subtenants of Everhart, as well as from his quarters and the attic of the farmhouse, pursuant to a search and seizure warrant issued on May 11, 1972, by Judge Byron Thompson of the District Court. That warrant authorized the search of a 1966 Lincoln Continental automobile bearing Maryland registration KJ4872, registered to Jerry Wayne Lawson, Route 6, Frederick, Maryland, as well as a two-story gray dwelling with gray metal brick-type siding located approximately two-tenths miles south of State Route 26, approximately one mile east of State Route 194, on the property known as the Nathan Doody farm, Route 1, Frederick, Maryland.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-5\">The affidavit for the issuance of the warrant made by Sgt. Carl R. Harbaugh of the Maryland State Police set forth an abundance of probable cause as to the person of Jerry Wayne Lawson (a codefendant) and his 1966 Lincoln Continental. We are here concerned only with so much of the affidavit as relates to the establishment of probable cause for the search of the farmhouse. The only allegations in the affidavit purporting to relate thereto are as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-6\">\u201cThat on May 2, 1972 Joe Lewis Petty, a known heroin addict, and distributor, was arrested and charged with several Breaking, Entering, and Larcenies; And</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-7\">During the course of the investigation, while conversing with your Affiant and other State Police Officers the said Joe Lewis Petty stated he visited the aforesaid Jerry Wayne Lawson on May 1, 1972 <em>at the previously described two story dwelling, located on the Nathan Doody farm, </em>south of State Route 26, <em>in an effort to \u2018make a deal\u2019 concerning purchases of heroin; </em>And</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-8\">That on May 4, 1972, Tfc. John W. Reburn, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>Maryland State Police, and Detective Lieutenant Paul W. Mossburg, Frederick City Police Department, went to the aforesaid two story dwelling located on the Nathan Doody farm south of State Route 26 <em>and obtained a large amount of narcotic and restricted drugs that had been reported stolen from the Parkview Medical Center on May 3. 1972; </em>And</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-6\">That the aforesaid Jerry Wayne Lawson was present at the aforementioned two story dwelling at the time officers obtained the stolen drugs; And That on May 6, 1972 the previously mentioned past proven, confidential and reliable informant advised your Affiant that <em>prior to the arrival of the aforementioned </em>Tfc. John W. Reburn and Det. Lt. Paul W. Mossburg, the said Jerry Wayne <em>Lawson had sold heroin to a known drug user; </em>. . . .\u201d (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">Prior to the petitioner\u2019s trial he filed in the Circuit Court, pursuant to Maryland Rule 729 b 1 \u2014 after his indictment \u2014 a motion for suppression of the property seized under the warrant asserting, <em>inter alia, </em>(1) that there was no probable cause for its issuance, (2) that \u201cthe major factor in the application was the illegal search and seizure at the same residence on May 4, 1972,\u201d (3) that the defendant is not mentioned or named or incriminated in any manner by the application and (4) that the application failed \u201cto satisfy the requirements of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">In his attack upon the validity of the affidavit made in application for the search and seizure warrant counsel pointed out that so much of it as pertained to a visit unto the Nathan Doody farm on May 1st by Petty in an effort to purchase heroin from Lawson was a \u201cbare allegation that he made an effort to make a deal\u201d in that there was no showing that any such narcotics transaction ever took place at the farm; that so much of the affidavit as pertained to the purchase of heroin by a known informant from Lawson on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>May 6, 1972, did not provide a sufficient basis for probable cause since it failed to set forth that such transaction had occurred at the farm. The principal thrust of the motion to suppress was addressed to the contention that an illegal warrantless search and seizure of the farmhouse had been conducted by the police on May 4, 1972, \u201cin violation of the constitution\u201d; that on that date, according to the police report, \u201cthey saw bags outside the house that indicated that they were similar bags to those stolen in a recent robbery of a clinic that contained drugs\u201d; that the police entered the house and told Mr. Lawson, the only one present, that they \u201cwanted to see Mr. Everhart,\u201d that they were \u201cgoing to search the place whether you like it or not,\u201d asked direction to Everhart\u2019s room and had Lawson take them up to Everhart\u2019s room. He proffered the testimony of Lawson in support of these allegations and, citing <em>Wong Sun v. United States, </em>371 U. S. 471 (1963), asserted that the police \u201ccannot use the tainted evidence, the results of an illegal search and seizure to form probable cause for the new application for a warrant.\u201d He cited as well <em>Brown v. State, </em>15 Md. App. 584, 292 A. 2d 762 (1972), as authority for his contention that Lawson was without authority to permit an inspection of Everhart\u2019s quarters, and <em>Coolidge v. New Hampshire, </em>403 U. S. 443 (1971), concerning the need for a search warrant for the May 4th intrusion into the farmhouse.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">Counsel for the petitioner repeatedly emphasized that the \u201csearch and seizure [of May 4th] represented the facts upon which the search warrant [of May 11th] was granted,\u201d that the evidence obtained from that illegal search and seizure cannot be used \u201cto form the probable cause for this application for a warrant\u201d; that the \u201cillegal seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment does not represent probable cause, it clearly taints everything . . . .\u201d After again proffering the testimony of Lawson, the trial judge opined that it was not permissible to go beyond the \u201cfour corners\u201d of the application for the search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-6\">Countering these contentions the State\u2019s Attorney, in his dialogue with the court, stressed the impermissibility of the court going outside the \u201cfour corners\u201d of the application and, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>in arguing that no testimony could be taken on the motion, contended that the court \u201chas to assume the validity and trustworthiness of the statements made under affidavit by the officer who secured this warrant.\u201d Conceding that the farmhouse had been \u201csearched\u201d by the officers on May 4th, he argued that \u201cwhat the officers saw from hallway looking into the room\u201d \u2014 when they had seen a green bag in Everhart\u2019s room, and through that green bag could see a box of hypodermic needles, as well as having observed on the floor of his room a hypodermic syringe, a needle and a bloody piece of cotton \u2014 even though such evidence might be physically inadmissible, the officers\u2019 observations, as being within their plain and open view, were admissible. The State\u2019s Attorney additionally pointed out to the court that upon their visit to the premises on May 4th the officers had seized, outside the building, a quantity of drugs contained in the same type (green) bag which was \u201cpart of the garbage\u201d; that the officers, having seen these items outside the building, \u201cwent inside\u201d and that even though the trial court might strike down as not admissible in evidence some of the items seized on May 4th the court should not strike down that which was found outside the building \u201cin the garbage [as] abandoned property\u201d \u2014 which would be admissible in evidence. The State\u2019s Attorney conceded that if the seizure on May 4th had been pursuant to a search and seizure warrant which was subsequently shown to have been invalid a subsequent search warrant as the basis for the May 19th search and seizure might be tainted by a search under such an invalid warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-5\">When, in rebuttal, counsel for the appellant contended that the \u201cabandoned property\u201d outside the premises did not contain drugs but referred to bags that had allegedly carried drugs, Judge Barrick again hypothetically asked whether or not he could take testimony as to facts outside the \u201cfour corners\u201d of the application \u201cif the judge who issued the search warrant is satisfied that [such facts] are true.\u201d In urging that he could, petitioner\u2019s counsel submitted that if in fact there \u201cwas a tainted search and seizure that that taint carries over to the application\u201d for the search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>By way of surrebuttal the State\u2019s Attorney vigorously urged that the determination of probable cause, under the holdings in <em>Henson v. State, </em>236 Md. 518, 521, 204 A. 2d 516, 518 (1964), must be \u201cdetermined by the judge or justice who issues the warrant, and if a prudent and cautious man would be justified from the facts presented to show its existence in believing that the offense had been or was being committed, the warrant properly may be issued,\u201d that the existence of \u201cprobable cause\u201d cannot be controverted by testimony outside the \u201cfour corners\u201d of the application for the search warrant and that upon the facts set forth there was sufficient probable cause for Judge Thompson to issue the search warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">Judge Barrick, satisfied that he \u201cshould not take any testimony and that [he] should review the application for the search warrant and make a decision of what appears in the four corners of the application,\u201d took the matter under advisement.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">In a memorandum opinion denying the motion to suppress filed on September 29, 1972, the trial court recognized that \u201c[t]he main thrust of the defendant\u2019s argument is that part of the narcotics and restricted drugs obtained on May 4, 1972, was the result of an illegal search and seizure and therefore, should not be used as a factor in the application and affidavit for the search warrant which was subsequently issued on May 11, 1972.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">After pointing out the elements within the equation of \u201cprobable cause\u201d and that in searching for its existence the lower court must look \u201conly in the affidavit itself and may not go outside it,\u201d Judge Barrick concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-9\">\u201cAssuming without deciding that part of the drugs seized on May 4, 1972, are not admissible in evidence, that alone will not suffice in determining probable cause in the issuance of the search warrant. The inadmissibility of that part of the evidence at trial would not warrant the suppression of all the evidence on the theory that there was not probable cause for the issuance of the search <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number>warrant. If we were to exclude that part of the evidence allegedly illegally seized, there is still more than ample facts in the application to establish probable cause for the issuance of the search warrant. The application and affidavit outlined numerous facts on which Judge Thompson had probable cause for affecting a search warrant for the 1966 Lincoln Continental and the dwelling located on the Nathan Doody farm.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">In affirming the petitioner\u2019s conviction the Court of Special Appeals, in <em>Everhart v. State, </em>20 Md. App. 71, 315 A. 2d 80 (1974), held that it was not \u201cdealing with a proper invocation by the appellant of \u2018the fruit of the poisonous tree\u2019 doctrine,\u201d since \u201cthe very tentative effort to establish a primary taint was in no way preserved for appellate review.\u201d Quoting from an argumentative section of the petitioner\u2019s brief the court converted his contention to the question of the applicability of the exclusionary rule to an <em>ex parte, in camera </em>proceeding wherein a magistrate determines whether probable cause exists for the issuance of a search and seizure warrant. That court concluded that \u201cthe attack upon the warrant at the suppression hearing was confined to a review of its surface sufficiency and thus limited the issue before it to the precise question as to \u2018whether there was probable cause for the search of the \u201cNathan Doody farm\u201d \u2019 \u201d \u2014 when the affidavit was submitted to Judge Thompson in the District Court on May 11th.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">In its analysis of what it termed \u201cthree references\u201d to the farm, the Court of Special Appeals \u2014 concerning the first reference \u2014 Petty\u2019s visit to Lawson on May 1, 1972 at the farm \u201cin an effort to \u2018make a deal\u2019 concerning purchases of heroin\u201d \u2014 found that the \u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d prong and the \u201cveracity\u201d prong, under the holdings in <em>Aguilar v. Texas, </em>378 U. S. 108 (1964), were satisfied; that Petty\u2019s statement appeared to be a genuine \u201cdeclaration against penal interest\u201d in satisfaction of the holdings in <em>United States v. Harris, </em>403 U. S. 573 (1971), and that although the information set forth did not necessarily point to the farm as the hiding place of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>the drugs which Lawson was purportedly selling, established \u201csome nexus between Lawson himself and the farm.\u201d The court rejected the second reference to the farm \u2014 the report from a confidential and reliable informant made on June 6, 1972, that prior to the arrival of the officers \u201cLawson had sold heroin to a known drug user\u201d \u2014 as not providing any basis for probable cause since no \u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d for the reference to the farm was in any event set forth either explicitly or implicitly.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Concerning the third reference to the farm \u2014 the obtention by the police on May 4, 1972 of a large amount of narcotic and restricted drugs that had been stolen from the Parkview Medical Center on May 3, 1972 and the allegation that Lawson was present at the time of the recovery of those drugs \u2014 the Court of Special Appeals disagreed with Judge Barrick\u2019s conclusion that that evidence was \u201csuperfluous\u201d and found that it was \u201clegitimately in the probable cause equation\u201d and within the \u201csurface sufficiency of the existence of probable cause when the affidavit in application for the search and seizure warrant was submitted to the District Court judge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">After a discussion on the exclusionary rule and premising that the rule was neither \u201cmandated,\u201d nor \u201cdesired\u201d and its invocation was indeed inappropriate in that it had no place \u201cwhen a magistrate makes his <em>ex parte, </em>in camera determination that the police application for a search warrant contains adequate probable cause,\u201d the court reached this conclusion. That although its holding was \u201crestricted to a constitutional finding that the probable cause affidavit was not facially insufficient, and that the warrant-issuing magistrate is not required to raise <em>sua sponte </em>possible constitutional problems\u201d intimated that the result may have been different \u201chad the appellant adequately raised at the suppression hearing, and adequately preserved for appellate review, an effort to look behind \u2018the four corners of the affidavit\u2019 in order to establish some primary taint, and then to apply the exclusionary rule to the ostensible fruits of that ostensible taint.\u201d As an aside the court recognized that the doctrine of the \u201cfruits of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>poisonous tree\u201d on the one hand and what it sensed to be a \u201cdiscernible and almost tidal retreat from the exclusionary rule by the Supreme Court\u201d on the other hand \u2014 were in essential collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">Parenthetically it must here be observed that the very same evidence which the petitioner contended tainted the affidavit for the search and seizure warrant and which was alluded to by both his counsel and the State\u2019s Attorney, in the suppression hearing before Judge Barrick, was passed upon by the Court of Special Appeals since that evidence was admitted in the trial of the case upon the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">Lt. Mossburg of the Frederick City Police Department in company with Trooper Reburn, went to the petitioner\u2019s tenant house on the evening of May 4, 1972; as they drove their car up to the side of the house they noticed an area where \u201ctrash bags were all piled in a heap.\u201d Noticing that one of the bags was \u201ca light color bluish green plastic bag commonly used by medical people\u201d the lieutenant opened it, inspected it and removed from it three separate boxes addressed to different physicians; one contained Dexamyl, another Phenergran Expectorant with Codeine and the third Doriden, a tranquilizer \u2014 all \u201ccontrolled dangerous substances.\u201d He also recovered a needle, a syringe and three pieces of raw cotton with dark blood-like stains upon them.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">After recovering these items from the plastic bag outside the house the officers entered and had Lawson, who lived in one of the rooms with his girlfriend, take them to the second floor and point out the room belonging to the petitioner. Although the prosecution did not undertake to introduce any physical evidence seized from the petitioner\u2019s room and did not offer into evidence any observations made by the lieutenant within the room, it elicited testimony that while standing in the hallway, looking into Everhart\u2019s room, the lieutenant saw a hypodermic needle, another piece of cotton with a red substance on it, some nondescript capsules lying on the floor, a green plastic bag similar to the one found in the trash area outside the house and boxes similar to those recovered from the trash bag outside which appeared to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>have been the types of boxes which package medications and hypodermic needles.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">With respect to the search of the plastic bag in an area \u201cwhere trash bags were piled in a heap\u201d and the seizure therefrom the Court of Special Appeals found that it was abandoned property, with no continuing property interest and no reasonable expectation of privacy in connection therewith and was thus outside the protection of the Fourth Amendment \u2014 and its admissibility was thus proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">As to the second category of evidence obtained by the police on May 4th, the Court of Special Appeals found that the state had not met its burden to \u201cdemonstrate that the consent [by Lawson] was in fact voluntarily given, not the result of duress or coercion, express or implied,\u201d under the holdings in <em>Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, </em>412 U. S. 218 (1973), and distinguishing the holdings in <em>Brown v. State, </em>15 Md. App. 584, 292 A. 2d 762 (1972), concerning the \u201cplain view\u201d doctrine; that court concluded that although what Lt. Mossburg observed by his visual search from the portal of the petitioner\u2019s room was not properly admissible,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the court was convinced, beyond a reasonable doubt, that since such evidence was \u201cmerely cumulative\u201d its admissibility had not contributed to the verdict of guilty and, under the holdings in <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 U. S. 18 (1967), held that its admission was \u201charmless error.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">Upon this posture of the case we granted certiorari limited solely to the question: whether the petitioner was indicted, arrested and convicted on the basis of a search and seizure warrant issued without probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">As a threshhold issue to our review of the case we reject the conclusion reached by the Court of Special Appeals that the petitioner\u2019s contention \u2014 that the search warrant was \u201ctainted\u201d by an unlawful search and seizure at the Nathan Doody farm \u2014 was not procedurally preserved for appellate review. In quoting a portion of the dialogue between <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>petitioner\u2019s counsel and the hearing judge, as a basis for concluding that the petitioner had \u201cacquiesced\u201d in the refusal of the trial court to receive from Lawson the proffered testimony the Court of Special Appeals, by ellipsis, omitted from the quoted dialogue the prefatory remarks of counsel that he did not want \u201cto drive this point into the ground,\u201d but that \u201cthe only other thing they have is this large seizure of drugs on May 4th, which once again we feel is certainly in violation of the Constitution and clearly contravenes the philosophy and principles espoused by the Court of Special Appeals in the <em>Brown </em>case <em>[Brown v. State, </em>15 Md. App. 584, 292 A. 2d 762 (1972)].\u201d It was this statement by counsel which immediately preceded his quoted comment that \u201cit would be helpful if the court wishes to hear from Mr. Lawson as to what happened on the May 4th date that we should put it in the record.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">Nor do we agree that the quoted portion of counsel\u2019s dialogue with the trial court, at the very end of the hearing on the motion \u2014 after 30 pages of argument and proffer \u2014 constitutes an \u201ceven more diffident\u201d surrender, or waiver, of the thrust of the objection made by the petitioner. Judge Barrick in his memorandum denying the motion specifically recognized that: \u201cThe \u2018main thrust\u2019 of the defendant\u2019s argument is that part of the narcotics and restricted drugs obtained on May 4, 1972, was the result of an illegal search and seizure and therefore, should not be used as a factor in the application and affidavit for the issuance of the search warrant which was subsequently issued on May 11, 1972.\u201d In no wise did Judge Barrick consider that this \u201cmain thrust\u201d had been either abandoned or waived.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">We do not believe that the quoted portion of the dialogue between counsel and the trial court can be equated with an acquiescence in the ruling, since the court had repeatedly pointed out that it could not take evidence which went beyond the \u201cfour corners\u201d of the application for the warrant; it seems to us that counsel\u2019s comments evidenced only a deferential respect and an acknowledgment that he understood the court\u2019s ruling and the court\u2019s concept of the law. To belabor his point might have shown conduct which could be considered contumacious.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>Our independent review of the entire proceedings on the motion \u2014 set forth at some length, <em>supra </em>\u2014 convinces us that the \u201ctaint\u201d issue raised by petitioner was properly preserved. Maryland Rule 729 g 2 provides that a \u201cpre-trial ruling, denying a motion or petition to suppress, exclude or return property seized, shall in any event be reviewable on appeal to the appropriate appellate court . . . .\u201d <em>See Mace Produce Co. v. State\u2019s Attorney, </em>251 Md. 503, 509, 248 A. 2d 346, 350 (1968); <em>Cleveland v. State, </em>8 Md. App. 204, 259 A. 2d 73 (1969), <em>cert. denied, </em>257 Md. 732 (1970). Additionally petitioner clearly made known to the hearing judge the action which he desired the court to take and the reasons therefor. <em>See Brice v. State, </em>254 Md. 655, 255 A. 2d 28 (1969); <em>Caviness v. State, </em>244 Md. 575, 224 A. 2d 417 (1966); he also made a proffer upon the record concerning the nature of the testimony to be submitted by Lawson and the hearing judge rejected its admissibility. <em>See Leitch v. Board of Education, </em>248 Md. 611, 616, n. 1, 237 A. 2d 748, 751, n. 1 (1968); <em>Fowler v. Benton, </em>229 Md. 571, 575, 185 A. 2d 344, 347 (1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b494-5\">We postulate our review of so much of the affidavit as may relate to the existence of probable cause for the search of the Nathan Doody farm upon the premise that if an affidavit for a search and seizure warrant contains improper information which should not be considered by the court, the court is nonetheless justified in issuing the warrant if additionally the affidavit contains within it sufficient proper information to show the existence of probable cause. <em>Tucker v. State, </em>244 Md. 488, 498, 224 A. 2d 111, 116-17 (1966), <em>cert. denied, </em>386 U. S. 1024 (1967); <em>Shrout v. State, </em>238 Md. 170, 175, 208 A. 2d 585, 588 (1965); <em>Adams v.

Edwards, </em>266 Md. 515, 519, 295 A. 2d 465, 467 (1972), quoting with approval from <em>Dumbra v. United States, </em>268 U. S. 435 (1925). <em>See also Henderson v. State, </em>243 Md. 342, 344, 221 A. 2d 76, 77 (1966); <em>Henson v. State, </em>236 Md. 518, 521, 204 A. 2d 516, 518 (1964).</p>\n<p id=\"b495-5\">We disagree with the resolution by the Court of Special Appeals in its analysis concerning the \u201cfirst reference\u201d to the farm \u2014 the recitation that Petty, on May 1st, had visited the farm <em>\u201cin an effort to \u2018make a deal\u2019 </em>concerning purchases of heroin.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) Other allegations in the affidavit which independently set forth an abundance of probable cause concerning Lawson and his 1966 Lincoln Continental established that he was selling heroin from that vehicle and had made sales from it while parked on the parking lot of a Frederick bowling alley. Lawson\u2019s address was listed as on Route 6, Frederick County, Maryland. Although the lower court found that this \u201creference\u201d established \u201csome nexus between Lawson himself and the farm,\u201d the court also found that this information did not point to the farm \u201cas the hiding place or \u2018stash\u2019 of the contraband drugs.\u201d No other allegation in any way connects Lawson or his vehicle with the farm. This \u201creference\u201d appears to us to be per se factually innocuous; if anything, it might persuade a reasonably prudent and cautious person to conclude \u2014 since Petty was unable to \u201cmake a deal\u201d \u2014 that no heroin was being stored, or sold, or had ever been sold at the Nathan Doody farm. Giving rise to no more than a suspicion or possibility, such \u201creference\u201d cannot provide any basis to believe that the law was being violated on those premises. <em>See Davids v. State, </em>208 Md. 377, 118 A. 2d 636 (1955); <em>DeAngelo v. State, </em>199 Md. 48, 85 A. 2d 468 (1952); <em>Gorman v. State, </em>161 Md. 700, 158 A. 903 (1932). <em>See also United States v. Bailey, </em>458 F. 2d 408 (9th Cir. 1972). <em>Compare State v. Kraft, </em>269 Md. 583, 614-16, 307 A. 2d 683, 698-99 (1973), where, in addition to an allegation that \u201ca known and convicted heroin user was seen at this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>apartment,\u201d the affidavit was fortified by the observations of two informants who had seen large quantities of LSD in the apartment, and yet a third informant had purchased LSD and other narcotics from the lessee of the apartment; and <em>State v. Edwards, supra, </em>where an informant, visiting Edwards\u2019 premises had been told that \u201csome good stuff\u201d had arrived but that \u201cit would be a while before [Edwards] could do anything for the [informant],\u201d and where additionally the informant, while upon Edwards\u2019 premises, observed in detail paraphernalia customarily used in the measuring and packaging of heroin. 266 Md. at 524-25, 295 A. 2d at 469-70.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-5\">We agree with the analysis and conclusion reached by the Court of Special Appeals concerning what it termed the \u201csecond reference to the farm\u201d \u2014 the recitation that on May 6, 1972, an informant had advised the affiant that prior to the arrival of Trooper Reburn and Lt. Mossburg Lawson had sold heroin to a known drug user. We agree that the informant\u2019s \u201cbasis of knowledge\u201d under <em>Aguilar v. Texas, supra, \u201cfor the </em>reference to the farm was in no event set forth either explicitly or implicitly\u201d and thus cannot be considered as being within the probable cause determination. Indeed, it might be additionally observed that the reference is semantical in that, although it relates to an incident, apparently prior to the arrival of the officers on May 4th, at the farm, it nowhere states therein that Lawson had sold heroin \u201cto a known drug user\u201d in, upon or at the farm.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-6\">With both these references removed as bases for establishing probable cause we are thus confronted solely with the third reference in the affidavit for the warrant which recites the seizure by the police of narcotic and restricted drugs at the Nathan Doody farm on May 4, 1972 \u2014 concededly in a warrantless search.</p>\n<p id=\"b496-7\">In <em>Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, supra, </em>cited by the Court of Special Appeals in connection with Lawson\u2019s purported consent for the police to search the farmhouse, Mr. Justice Stewart, who delivered the opinion for the Court, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b496-8\">\u201cIt is well settled under the Fourth and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>Fourteenth Amendments that a search conducted without a warrant issued upon probable cause is <em>\u2018per se </em>unreasonable . . . subject only to a few specifically established and well-delineated exceptions.\u2019 <em>Katz v. United States, </em>389 U. S. 347, 357; <em>Coolidge v. New Hampshire, </em>403 U. S. 443, 454-455; <em>Chambers v. Maroney, </em>399 U. S. 42, 51. It is equally well settled that one of the specifically established exceptions to the requirements of both a warrant and probable cause is a search that is conducted pursuant to consent. <em>Davis v.

S. at 219.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">\u201c \u2018Belief, however well founded, that an article sought is concealed in a dwelling house furnishes no justification for a search of that place without a warrant. And such searches are held unlawful notwithstanding facts unquestionably showing probable cause.\u2019 \u201d <em>Coolidge v. New Hampshire, </em>403 U.

S. 493, 497-98 (1958); <em>Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States, </em>251 U. S. 385, 392 (1920). This same principle was enunciated by this Court as early as 1952 in <em>Griffin v. State, </em>200 Md. 569, 573, 92 A. 2d 743, 745, <em>cert. denied, </em>345 U. S. 907 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">In <em>Beale v. State, </em>230 Md. 182, 186 A. 2d 213 (1962), when a police' officer at the appellant\u2019s front door demanded admittance to her apartment she threw narcotics paraphernalia out her back window into the rear yard where a second policeman was standing within that hedge-enclosed portion of the premises. Picking up the thrown objects and identifying one of them as a hypodermic needle he yelled this fact to his partner still awaiting entrance at the front door. That officer then \u201ckicked the door open\u201d and went into the apartment where he found the appellant in possession of a marijuana cigarette.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-9\">This Court, in finding that the officer who had stationed himself in the back yard was a trespasser and that his partner who had entered the front door had become a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>trespasser, reversed the appellant\u2019s conviction upon a finding that the seizure of the jettisoned materials was clearly illegal and its admissibility into evidence was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">Judge Horney, who delivered the opinion of the Court, stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-6\">\u201cIn <em>Gorman v. State, </em>161 Md. 700, 158 Atl. 903 (1932), where the facts and circumstances were similar to those in the case at bar, a police officer, having seen a number of persons entering and leaving the house of the defendant, suspected a violation of the lottery laws and entered the house through an open door, without either a warrant to search the premises or to arrest the defendant, and took possession of the gambling paraphernalia he found there. In holding that such evidence was procured by an illegal search and seizure, even though the officer had not found it necessary to break open the door, it was said (at p. 704) that \u2018the bursting open of the door was not the essence of the offense; it was the invasion of the privacy of the defendant\u2019s home, [for] under the facts and circumstances stated, the officer was * * * a trespasser in entering the house of the defendant.\u2019 See also <em>McDonald v. United States, </em>335 U. S. 451 (1948), where it was held that evidence obtained by trespassing officers should have been excluded. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b498-7\">The case of <em>Mattingly v. Commonwealth, </em>247 S. W. 938 (Ky. 1923), though not directly in point, is likewise authority for the proposition that officers wrongfully on the premises of a suspect may not lawfully search his premises and seize such illegal possessions as they may find there. In that case, where officers, who were in an enclosure near a house with a warrant that was ineffective because it was\u2019 based on insufficient affidavits, looked through a window and obtained certain information before forcibly entering the house, the Court of Appeals of Kentucky held that the information <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>thus received, as well as that obtained after entering the house, was inadmissible in evidence.\u201d 230 Md. at 185-86, 186 A. 2d at 215.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">In concluding that the seizure of the contraband in the back yard by the intruding police officer was illegal this Court, quoting with approval from <em>Hobson v. United States, </em>226 F. 2d 890 (8th Cir. 1955), held that \u201cthe back yard was part of the curtilage surrounding the dwelling.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">In <em>Wanzer v. State, </em>202 Md. 601, 97 A. 2d 914 (1953), a State Trooper, from a nearby road, looking through a picket fence, about 100 yards from the defendant\u2019s residence, saw about 40 or 50 people, many holding cans of beer, \u201cmilling around\u201d on the defendant\u2019s lawn. He also heard \u201cloud dance music and laughter.\u201d Accompanied by a neighbor, a local police officer and a Justice of the Peace (who accompanied the Trooper to sign arrest warrants) he entered the property through the front gate; some of the \u201cguests\u201d were arrested for \u201calleged disturbance of the peace.\u201d On the lawn the Trooper saw a roulette wheel lying near an improvised gambling table. The \u201craiding party\u201d then entered and searched the out buildings, as well as the dwelling, finding evidence which was sufficient to show violations of both the gambling and liquor laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-9\">In an opinion written by Chief Judge Sobeloff this Court, after finding that when the police went upon the property there was no probable cause to believe that the common law misdemeanor of \u201cbreach of the peace\u201d was being committed, held that the entrance of the police on the appellant\u2019s lawn \u2014 upon the \u201ccurtilage\u201d surrounding the dwelling house \u2014 and then into the house was unlawful and that the seizures made by them while so trespassing were illegal.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-10\"><em>Compare Harris v. State, </em>203 Md. 165, 99 A. 2d 725 (1953), where the Court, observing that \u201cthe mere absence of a physical barrier, such as a fence or door or gate is not conclusive of the question of whether an alley or passageway is part of the curtilage,\u201d found that the police officer, in making observations, upon which he applied for a search and seizure warrant, was upon a passageway which had a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>common use. <em>Compare also Davis v. State, </em>236 Md. 389, 204 A. 2d 76 (1964), <em>cert. denied, </em>380 U. S. 966 (1965), in which this Court held that there was no illegality compelling the suppression of evidence from within a house, where the police found a body lying in debris in the yard, a trail of blood and scuffed grass led to the rear door of the premises, and a policeman, after receiving no response to a knock upon the door, noticed through a window a \u201cpair of human feet\u201d (belonging to the defendant) then lying on a couch. Because their duties mandated an investigation to determine whether or not more than one had been victimized in the carnage, as well as the possibility that the person observed might need immediate aid, such exigent circumstances were held to preclude the police from being \u201ctrespassers upon the curtilage\u201d and were considered \u201cparamount to the constitutional demand of a search warrant as a condition precedent to the invasion of the privacy of a dwelling house.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">In a companion case, decided herewith, <em>Carter v. State, </em>274 Md. 411, 337 A. 2d 415 (1975), we held that Carter, who, upon a motion to suppress evidence obtained pursuant to a search and seizure warrant for his apartment, asserted that the allegations set forth in the affidavit for the warrant had been obtained through the employment by the police of illegal electronic surveillance, and proffered evidence in support of that contention, was entitled to an evidentiary hearing for the purpose of determining whether or not the allegations set forth in the affidavit were \u201ctainted\u201d and had been derived from and through an illegal electronic surveillance.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-6\">In doing so, we did not diminish the viability of our rule proscribing any controversion of the <em>truth </em>of the grounds stated in an affidavit in application for a search and seizure warrant, as originally announced in <em>Smith v. State, </em>191 Md. 329, 335-36, 62 A. 2d 287, 289-90 (1948), <em>cert. denied, </em>336 U. S. 925 (1949), and followed in a long series of cases, set forth in <em>Carter, </em>including <em>Tucker v. State, 244 </em>Md. 488, 499-500, 224 A. 2d 111, 117-18 (1966), <em>cert. denied, </em>386 U. S. 1024 (1967). It was this rule which Judge Barrick applied when, in not accepting the proffered testimony, he held that the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>must confine itself to the affidavit itself and may not go outside its \u201cfour corners\u201d in determining the existence of probable cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-5\">By our holdings in <em>Carter </em>we have engrafted an exception upon the rule so as to permit, in a proper case, an inquiry as to the legality of the <em>source </em>of the data set forth in an affidavit in application for a search warrant. Thus, in such a case, inquiry may be made beyond the \u201cfour corners\u201d of the affidavit. <em>See Clark v. Commonwealth, </em>288 Ky. 845, 157 S.W.2d 485 (1941), citing <em>White v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Ky. 535, 299 S. W. 168 (1927), which we quoted with approval in <em>Carter, supra. See also Brooks v. State, </em>13 Md.

App. 534, 275 A. 2d 532 (1971) (search warrants dependent upon validity of prior warrants).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-6\">Although our holdings in <em>Carter v. State, supra, </em>were predicated upon his contention \u2014 and proffer \u2014 that the information set forth in the application for the search warrant was obtained in violation of the provisions of Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, as codified in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2510-2520, as well as through an illegal \u201cinvasion of his privacy\u201d within the protection of the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, we do not think that Everhart\u2019s contention \u2014 and proffer \u2014 directed only to an unlawful search and seizure at the farmhouse on May 4, 1972 requires any different result.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">In applying the criteria laid down by the Fourth Amendment and as established by the opinions of the United States Supreme Court applying that Amendment, as prescribed in <em>Ker v. California, </em>374 U. S. 23, 33-34 (1963), we find that the holdings in <em>Silverthorne Lumber Co. v. United States, supra, </em>in <em>Nardone v. United States, </em>308 U. S. 338 (1939), in <em>Wong Sun v. United States, </em>371 U. S. 471 (1963),<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"480\">*480</page-number>and in <em>Alderman v. United States, </em>394 U. S. 165 (1969), as explicated in <em>Carter v. State, supra, </em>compel the conclusion that if data set forth as a basis for the existence of probable cause in an application for a search warrant, was come upon or derived as a result of an illegal search and seizure, such primary illegality \u2014 in the absence of evidence of attenuation or a source independent of such \u201ctaint\u201d \u2014 precludes the use of such derivative evidence from being a valid basis for establishing the existence of probable cause, under the doctrine of the \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b502-5\">As was stated by Mr. Justice White in writing for the majority in <em>Alderman v. United States, supra, </em>quoted with approval in <em>Carter v. State, supra:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b502-6\">\u201cIf the police make an unwarranted search of a house and seize tangible property belonging to third parties \u2014 even a transcript of a third-party conversation \u2014 the homeowner may object to its use against him, not because he had any interest in the seized items as \u2018effects\u2019 protected by the Fourth Amendment, but because they were the fruits of an unauthorized search of his house, which is itself expressly protected by the Fourth Amendment. <em>Nothing seen or found on the premises may legally form the basis </em>for an arrest or <em>search warrant </em>or for testimony at the homeowner\u2019s trial, since the prosecution would be using the fruits of a Fourth Amendment violation. <em>Silverthorne Lumber Co. v.

Once a defendant, with requisite standing, has timely and factually asserted that the challenged evidence was derived from information obtained in an unlawful search and seizure, the court must afford him an opportunity to explore in detail the circumstances under which the evidence was acquired; if the defendant establishes that the evidence resulted from an unlawful search and seizure such evidence cannot be used at all unless the prosecution can convince the trial court that it had an independent origin or that the information gained in the unlawful search did not lead directly or indirectly to the discovery of the challenged evidence. <em>See </em>Annot., <em>Evidence </em>\u2014 <em>\u201cFruit of the Poisonous Tree, \u201d </em>43 A.L.R.3d 385, 389, 393, 396-407 (1972). <em>See also </em>R.

We thus find that it was error, under the facts in this case, for Judge Barrick to have limited his review to the \u201cfour corners\u201d of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"483\">*483</page-number>the affidavit, we must, under our holdings in <em>Gill v.

This is so because upon our examination of the record we cannot conclude as a matter of law that these items were in fact \u201cabandoned property,\u201d nor are we able to conclude whether or not at the time of such search and seizure the officers were upon the curtilage or were invading an area in which the petitioner had a legitimate expectation of privacy. Without question, abandoned property does not fall within that category in which one has a legitimate expectation of privacy to bring it within the protection of the Fourth Amendment,<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> but whether property is abandoned is generally a question of fact based upon evidence of a combination of act and intent. <em>See Parman v.

Warden, </em>237 Md. 519, 206 A. 2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"484\">*484</page-number>793 (1965) (where the defendant, while being chased by the police, threw a packet of narcotics into a churchyard), and in <em>Matthews v. State, </em>237 Md. 384, 206 A. 2d 714 (1965) (where the defendant, again while being chased by the police, threw three brown envelopes which contained incriminating evidence under an automobile parked on a public street), the jettisoned materials were in each case held to have been \u201cabandoned.\u201d <em>See also Hester v. United States, </em>265 U. S. 57 (1924) (where the defendant, being pursued by revenue officers, in an open field, dropped the jug of whiskey which he was \u201ctoting\u201d). However, in <em>Work v. United States, </em>243 F. 2d 660 (D.C. Cir. 1957), the placing of a phial under the porch of a house was held to have been a concealment upon protected premises and not an abandonment, and in <em>Hobson v. United States, </em>226 F. 2d 890 (8th Cir. 1955), cited with approval and followed by this Court in <em>Beale v. State, supra, </em>the discard of a package of narcotics into the backyard (a part of the curtilage) of a dwelling house was held not to be an abandonment. The holdings of the Supreme Court of California in <em>People v. Edwards, </em>71 Cal. 2d 1096, 80 Cal. Rptr. 633, 458 P. 2d 713 (1969), seem to be particularly applicable since they involve facts virtually identical with those here. In that case police, with information from a neighbor that he had seen marijuana in a bag in the back of the house, entered the \u201copen backyard area\u201d of the defendant\u2019s residence and searched the contents of a trash can situate two to three feet from the door of the rear porch of the dwelling. The California Court, after an extensive review of the authorities, both federal and state, and concluding that the \u201cdefendants\u2019 reasonable expectation of privacy was violated by unreasonable governmental intrusion,\u201d held such search and seizure unlawful and found that the marijuana in the trash can had not been abandoned.</p>\n<p id=\"b506-5\">The curtilage is as much to be protected against unlawful searches and seizures without a warrant as the dwelling itself. <em>See Hobson v. United States, supra. </em>\u201cHouses,\u201d as within the protection of the Fourth Amendment, include the curtilage. <em>Rosencranz v. United States, </em>356 F. 2d 310 (1st <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"485\">*485</page-number>Cir. 1966). <em>In accord Roberson v. United States, </em>165 F. 2d 752 (6th Cir. 1948). The curtilage includes the yard around a farmhouse. <em>Kroska v. United States, </em>51 F. 2d 330 (8th Cir. 1931). A yard or lawn is considered within the protection of the curtilage and the mere absence of a physical barrier such as a fence, gate or hedge is not conclusive. <em>See Beale v. State, supra; Wanzer v. State, supra; </em>and <em>Harris v. State, supra. </em>An area searched near a pond on a farm which was several hundred yards away from the curtilage, although searched by a trespass, was held not to be within a protected area. <em>See United States v. Swann, </em>377 F. Supp. 1305 (D. Md. 1974). <em>In accord United States v. Minton, </em>488 F. 2d 37 (4th Cir. 1973), <em>cert. denied, </em>416 U. S. 936 (1974). In <em>United States v. Wolfe, </em>375 F. Supp. 949 (E.D. Pa. 1974), police removed trash from a pile on defendants\u2019 backyard along an areaway; citing <em>Fulbright v. United States, </em>392 F. 2d 432 (10th Cir. 1968), that court, recognizing that the Fourth Amendment reference to \u201chouses\u201d included as well their curtilage, nonetheless found that the area in question belonging to business premises could not be considered as within the curtilage.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-5\">In <em>Fixel v. Wainwright, </em>492 F. 2d 480 (5th Cir. 1974), the \u201cplain view\u201d doctrine was held insufficient to justify a warrantless search upon the curtilage when the officers entered the backyard of an apartment building, and such search was held to be in violation of the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b507-6\">The Supreme Court, however, no longer seems to speak concerning the \u201ccurtilage\u201d as opposed to \u201can open field\u201d and in <em>Katz v. United States, </em>389 U. S. 347 (1967), cited with approval in <em>Carter v. State, supra, </em>rejected the \u201ctrespass doctrine\u201d as being necessary for an invocation of the Fourth Amendment. There, pointing out that that amendment \u201cprotects people, not places,\u201d the Court stated \u201cwhat [one] seeks to preserve as private, even in an area accessible to the public, may be constitutionally protected\u201d (389 U. S. at 351-52); and made \u201cclear that the reach of that [Fourth] Amendment cannot turn upon the presence or absence of a physical intrusion into any given enclosure.\u201d 389 U. S. at 353. Evolving from the holdings in <em>Katz </em>is a protection within the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>Fourth Amendment of an area within which \u201cone has a legitimate expectation of privacy,\u201d as we pointed out in <em>Carter v. State, supra. See United States v. United States District Court, </em>407 U. S. 297 (1972); <em>Alderman v. United States, supra. See also Recznik v. City of Lorain, </em>393 U. S. 166 (1968); <em>Mancusi v. DeForte, </em>392 U. S. 364 (1968). Thus, although it might seem more nearly constitutionally accurate that inquiry be made as to whether the place, adjacent to the farmhouse, where the search and seizure was made from the plastic bag, was within an area where Everhart had a reasonably \u201clegitimate expectation of privacy,\u201d it would seem, a fortiori, that if there was an intrusion geographically within the curtilage it would be within such a protected area, notwithstanding that such plastic bag may have been within the officers\u2019 plain view.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-5\">Upon remand it will \u2018be necessary for the trial court to make a finding, in accordance with these principles, as to whether or not the search and seizure of the plastic bag was within the protection of the petitioner\u2019s rights under the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b508-6\">Although no motion to dismiss the indictment was made, we included, within the scope of our writ of certiorari, the question as well of whether the petitioner was indicted and arrested on the basis of a search and seizure warrant without probable cause. The evidence disclosed that Everhart was not at the Nathan Doody farmhouse when, on May 19, 1972, the search and seizure warrant issued on May 11, 1972 was executed. The docket entries disclose that he was both presented and indicted by the grand jury on June 22, 1972, and upon a capias issued pursuant to that presentment was arrested on June 29, 1972. Although in <em>State v. Siegel, </em>266 Md. 256, 292 A. 2d 86 (1972), <em>aff'g State v. Siegel, </em>13 Md. App. 444, 285 A. 2d 671 (1971), this Court sustained the dismissal of an indictment because of an invalid order authorizing an electronic surveillance, it seems clear under the decisions of the United States Supreme Court that \u201ca defendant is not entitled to have his indictment dismissed before trial simply because the government \u2018acquire[d] incriminating evidence in violation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>of the [law]/ even if the \u2018tainted evidence was presented to the grand jury.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gelbard v. United States, </em>408 U. S. 41, 60 (1972), citing <em>United States v. Blue, </em>384 U. S. 251, 255 (1966). <em>See also Lawn v. United States, </em>355 U. S. 339 (1958); <em>Costello v. United States, </em>350 U. S. 359 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b509-5\">More recently the United States Supreme Court in <em>United States v. Calandra, </em>414 U. S. 338 (1974), in a majority opinion by Mr. Justice Powell stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b509-6\">\u201cThe grand jury\u2019s sources of information are widely drawn, and the validity of an indictment is not affected by the character of the evidence considered. Thus, an indictment valid on its face is not subject to challenge on the ground that the grand jury acted on the basis of inadequate or incompetent evidence, <em>Costello v. United States, supra; Holt v. United States, </em>218 U. S. 245 (1910); or even on the basis of information obtained in violation of a defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, <em>Lawn v. United States, </em>355 U. S. 339 (1958).\u201d 414 U. S. at 344-45.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b509-7\">Although in <em>Calandra </em>the respondent had been subjected to an unconstitutional search and seizure, he was before a grand jury as a witness, under an offer of a grant of immunity, and even though the Court held that as such a witness he could not refuse to answer questions before the jury on the ground that they were based on evidence obtained from him as a result of an unlawful search and seizure, recognized nonetheless that \u201c[i]n the usual context of a <em>criminal trial, </em>the <em>defendant </em>is entitled to the suppression of, not only the evidence obtained through an unlawful search and seizure, but also any derivative use of that evidence. The prohibition of the exclusionary rule must reach such derivative use if it is to fulfill its function of deterring police misconduct.\u201d (Emphasis supplied.) 414 U. S. at 354.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-8\">Since the petitioner\u2019s arrest was based only upon his presentment and indictment by the grand jury and even the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"488\">*488</page-number>submission unto the grand jury of evidence obtained in violation of his constitutional rights would not impair the validity of his indictment, we must equally conclude that the alleged taint of the evidence set forth in the application for the search warrant had no bearing upon the legality of his arrest. As we see it, the only proper manner in which to present the issue raised by the petitioner was \u2014 as he did \u2014 through a motion to suppress filed in the court which had \u201ccriminal trial jurisdiction\u201d over the indictments returned against him. .</p>\n<p id=\"b510-5\">In view of the impact of our decision upon the well emplanted prior practice, which has heretofore limited the scope of judicial inquiry in motions attacking search and seizure warrants; and in order to avoid what might otherwise become \u201cfishing expeditions\u201d in delay of the orderly administration of criminal justice, we here construe Maryland Rule 729 to require that all such motions to suppress, or petitions when asserting an alleged illegal source of the information set forth as the basis for probable cause, be supported by precise and specific factual averments and not conclusionary allegations.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-6\">\n<em>Judgment of the Court of Special Appeals reversed; case remanded to that court with directions to reverse the judgments of the Circuit Court for Frederick County and remand the case for a new trial; costs to be paid by Frederick County, Maryland.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b483-11\">. The statute makes it unlawful \u201cto keep or maintain any common nuisance which 4 shall mean any dwelling house, apartment, building, vehicle, vessel, aircraft, or any place whatever which is resorted to by drug abusers for purposes of illegally administering controlled dangerous substances or . . . storage or concealment of controlled dangerous substances or controlled paraphernalia, as defined in subsection (d) of \u00a7 287 . . . .\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b483-12\">.

The conclusion reached by the Court of Special Appeals as to this \u201ccategory\u201d of evidence obtained from the Nathan Doody farmhouse on May 4th confirms the contention made by petitioner\u2019s counsel when, at the hearing, he proffered the testimony of Lawson.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b501-8\">.

State, 235 Md. 497, 201 A. 2d 824 (1964) (Brune, C. J. and Prescott, J., dissenting), <em>cert. denied, </em>380 U.
