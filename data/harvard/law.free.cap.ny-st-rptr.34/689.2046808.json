The proofs are insufficient. The fact that one of the defendants said the defendants <em>thought </em>they would have to turn over their business, that creditors might be left, and that they would have to protect themselves, does not prove that the defendants intended to transfer their property to cheat and defraud creditors. <em>Skiff </em>v. Stewart, 39 How. Pr., 385. It miay lead to the inference that the defendants intended something wrong, but this does not affirmatively prove fraud, which must be proved and cannot be presumed. See <em>Stringfield </em>v. Fields, 13 Daly, 171. It does not appear what the defendants\u2019 property consisted of, nor what it was worth, nor that anything was done to the injury of the plain tiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-3\">It follows that the order appealed from must be reversed, with costs to abide the event of the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b734-4\">McAdam, Oh.
