The defendant denied the employment, and claims that on the same day he sold the property to Annie E. Crooker for $13,150. See contract at fol. 66. The evidence was conflicting and the case had to go to the jury. The fact that the defendant employed and paid another broker, who effected a sale to another person, was not a defense, and the evidence respecting it was incompetent and therefore properly excluded. <em>Jarvis </em>v. <em>Schaefer, 105 N. </em>Y., 289; 7 N. Y. State Rep., 502. It is settled that when one of the contracting parties either prevents or waives .the literal performance of a condition precedent, which the other is ready and offers to fulfill, he cannot avail himself of such non-performance to relieve him from his own obligation. <em>Moses </em>v. <em>Bierling, </em>31 N. Y., 463 ; <em>Risley </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>64 id., 576 ; <em>Home Bank </em>v. <em>Drumgoole, </em>109 id., 63; 14 N. Y. State Rep., 40. The evidence sufficiently sustains the verdict, and we find no error requiring a new trial. Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-13\">Mo Ad AM, Ch.
