Second, because relator has not proved that it is its intention, in good faith, to construct, maintain and operate the railroad on the line proposed, and that it has or controls sufficient pecuniary means to perform the work; that the route is not defined with sufficient precision, and that the relator should have filed a map by which its route is more particularly defined, and' by which it is determined and fixed whether it is so located as to be within the streets named, or east or west thereof, and at what points its route is to intersect the streets.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b629-4\"><em>Henry D. </em>Sedgwick, for app\u2019lt; <em>William H Glar/c, </em>for resp\u2019ts.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b629-5\">O\u2019GrOKKAN, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ag8\">At the close of the trial of this case the relator applied to the trial judge for judgment in its favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">This motion was founded on the alternative writ of <em>mandamus </em>theretofore granted, on the return and supplemental return thereto and on the findings of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">The trial judge denied the application of the relator and closed his opinion thus:</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">\u201c Upon the whole case the conclusi\u00f3n is inevitable that the right of the relator to the relief demanded is so doubtful that the application for a writ should be denied. The defendants are therefore entitled to a final order or judgment denying the application and dismissing the alternative writ, with costs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b629-9\">After a careful examination of the findings, together with the briefs of the respective counsel on this appeal and of the authorities cited by them, I am convinced that the conclusion arrived at by the learned trial judge is in all respects correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-10\">It is the indisputable rule of law that a peremptory writ of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number><em>mandamus </em>should never be granted unless in a case where its purpose is to give effect to a clear legal right. <em>People ex rel. Mygatt </em>v. <em>Supervisors, etc., </em>11 N. Y., 563; <em>People ex rel. Perkins </em>v. <em>Hawkins, </em>46 id., 9; <em>People ex rel. Martin </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>55 id., 191.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-2\">In the case at bar the right which the relator seeks to enforce is not only not free from doubt, but the weight of reason and authority is against it.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-3\">The project which the relator in this case seeks to promote by the aid of a writ of <em>mandamus </em>is one which threatens the city of Rew York with serious disturbance and widespread inconvenience, with results of doubtful advantage.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-4\">The occasion demands on the part of the court great circumspection and caution, and thus the dictates of a wise forbearance unite with the principles of law in opposition to the relator\u2019s demand.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">Ro reason is apparent why the rights of the relator should not be ascertained and asserted by regular action at law and no urgent necessity is shown for a resort to the sudden and peremptory interposition by <em>mandamus.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">The order and adjudication of the trial judge are in all things affirmed for the reasons set forth in his written opinion, the relator to pay the respondent\u2019s costs of this appeal</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">Sedgwick, Gh.
