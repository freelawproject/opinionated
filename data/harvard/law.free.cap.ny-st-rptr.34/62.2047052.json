The risk of transportation was therefore upon him, and he in turn had his remedy for injuries to the goods against his carriel\u2019. Breakage was one of the incidents of the carriage not assumed by the defendant. Putting the words \u201cno allowance for breakage \u201d on the invoices can hardly be extended so as to make the defendant pay for valueless broken glass ware, neither ordered nor .desired, where, as in this case, the damage was done before the goods reached the defendant or its agents. The counterclaim for goods sold to Michols individually was carefully excluded from the consideration of the jury by the trial judge, so that the question whether a manufacturing corporation can purchase a claim for unliquidated damages is not before us for decision. The case was carefully tried, the verdict is sustained by the evidence, and the judgment appealed from must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"A6J\">McAdam, Ch.
