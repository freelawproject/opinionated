The action is upon an account stated for goods sold and delivered. The answer is a general denial. Thatthe goods were sold and delivered, and that the balance claimed has not been paid, were conceded facts on the trial. The only issues litigated were the statement of account and the liability of defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"Aoqz\">Upon the appeal from the order, defendant\u2019s contention is that the verdict is against the weight of evidence; but the rule is settled beyond controversy that, upon appeal from an order of the general term of the city court affirming an order denying a new trial, this court cannot reverse the order on the ground that the verdict is against the weight of evidence. <em>Rowe </em>v. <em>Comley, </em>11 Daly, 317; <em>Farley </em>v. Lyddy, 8 id., 515; <em>Tinsdale </em>v. Murray, 9 id., 446; <em>McEnteere </em>v. Little, 8 id., 167; <em>Bell </em>v. <em>Bartholomew, </em>11 Reporter, 510; 12 W. Dig., 33; <em>Duryea </em>v. Vosburgh, 121 N. Y., 57; 30 N. Y. State Rep., 683. But even had this court jurisdiction to review the order, it must be affirmed; because the case does not purport to contain all the evidence bearing on the questions in controversy. <em>Aldridge </em>v. Aldridge, 120 N. Y., 614; 31 N. Y. State Rep., 948 ; <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>107 N. Y., 531; 12 N. Y. State Rep., 479; <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Best, 50 </em>Hun, 76; 23 N. Y. State Rep., 876; <em>Wellington </em>v. <em>The Company, </em>52 Hun, 409; 24 N. Y. State Rep., 678 ; <em>Murphy </em>v. <em>The Board, </em>53 Hun, 171; 25 N. Y. State Rep., 154; <em>Cheney </em>v. <em>R. R. Co\u201e </em>16 Hun, 415 ; <em>Cornish </em>v. <em>Graff, </em>36 id., 160.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-15\">It is sufficient for the respondent that the case exhibits some evidence to support the verdict. <em>Aldridge </em>v. <em>Aldridge, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b342-16\">In the interest of substantial justice it should be said, that on a careful examination of the evidence we do not observe such a preponderance of proof for the appellant as would warrant a reversal of the verdict. <em>Baird </em>v. <em>The Mayor, </em>96 N. Y., 567. Upon the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>issues litigated, the case shows a direct conflict of evidence between the two witnesses of the respondent and the two witnesses of the appellant, and the rule is fundamental and familiar that the credibility of testimony is exclusively for the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-3\">The exceptions to the rulings and charge of the court are obviously untenable.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-4\">. <em>First. </em>The exclusion of the question, \u201cLook at this pass-book and say whether that was not ordered in the name of P. Haulenbeek? \u201d if erroneous, was corrected by the subsequent admission of the book itself, which exhibited the endorsement to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\"><em>Second. </em>As the answer alleged no defect of parties, the testimony stricken out and the testimony excluded, as to Berg being a partner of plaintiff, were irrelevant to any issue in the action. A defect of parties plaintiff is waived if not taken either by demurrer or answer. Code Civ. Pro., \u00a7 499; <em>Zabriskie </em>v. <em>Smith, </em>13 N. Y., 322; <em>Palmer </em>v. Davis, 28 id., 242.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\"><em>Third. </em>In the absence of a plea of payment, there was no error in excluding evidence that Mrs. Haulenbeek had settled the account sued for, <em>McKyring </em>v. <em>Bull, </em>16 N. Y., 297, and the fact that Mr. Haulenbeek paid some bills by his check as <em>agent, </em>authorized no inference that he was discharging his own obligation, but the reverse rather. But the error, if any, was corrected by subsequent proof of the fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\"><em>Fourth. </em>Appellant\u2019s final exception is to the charge of the court that \u201cunless you believe the plaintiff on that point, he must fail, unless you believe the <em>evidence of the. plaintiff and his bookkeeper to the effect that Mrs. Haulenbeek promised to pay this bill on several occasions.\u201d </em>The ground of objection was, as stated by counsel, \u201cmy remembrance that they testified that she.would see Mr. Haulenbeek and have him see to it.\u201d But counsel\u2019s memory was at fault. Plaintiff testified that defendant said <em>\u201c </em>she would see that I got my money,\u201d and the bookkeeper testified that when he presented the bill to defendant she said \u201c she didn\u2019t \u25a0have the money then but would have it by the next day,\u201d and that \u201cshe had got the bill and would pay it.\u201d The court, therefore, did not misstate the evidence in saying that, <em>in effect, </em>plaintiff and his bookkeeper testified that defendant promised to pay the bill If it were otherwise, however, appellant should have requested the court to correct its charge so as to conform it to the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-8\">The judgment and order must be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">Daly, Oh.
