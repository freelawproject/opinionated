Curtin, Resp\u2019t, <em>v. </em>Edward J. Curtin, App\u2019lt.</parties>\n<court data-order=\"1\" data-type=\"court\" id=\"b840-6\">\n<em>(City Court of Brooklyn,</em>\n</court>\n<p data-order=\"2\" data-type=\"misc\" id=\"A6n1\">\n<em>General Term,</em>\n</p>\n<decisiondate data-order=\"3\" data-type=\"decisiondate\" id=\"AacL\">\n<em>Filed December 22, 1890.)</em>\n</decisiondate>\n<headnotes data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"AmW\">Evidence\u2014Cboss-examination.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b840-7\">In an action for moneys loaned and disbursed for defendant and upon assigned claims against him, it is error to disallow questions on cross-examination of plaintiff touching the circumstances .attending such assignments and which if allowed might bring out matters material to the defense or which tend to weaken the force of plaintiff\u2019s direct testimony.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b840-8\">Appeal from judgment in favor of plaintiff entered on the report of a referee.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b840-9\"><em>Horace Craves, </em>for resp\u2019t; <em>A. J. Spences', </em>for app\u2019lt.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b840-10\">Osborne, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AQp\">Plaintiff brought this action against the defendant, his brother, to recover, <em>firstly, </em>for a balance of moneys alleged to have been loaned and disbursed by him for the defendant ; <em>secondly, </em>for a balance of moneys alleged to have been loaned by Margaret. Curtin, the mother of the parties, to defendant, and alleged to have been assigned by her to plaintiff, and, <em>thirdly, </em>for a balance for goods sold by one Birkett to defendant, and alleged to have been assigned by Birkett to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-11\">Defendant, by his answer, denied said indebtedness and the alleged assignments thereof by Mrs. Curtin and Birkett to plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-12\">The issues were tried before a referee who has found for the plaintiff for the full amount of his claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-13\">We think this judgment should be reversed, for the reason that, by the rulings of the referee, to which exceptions were taken, the defendant was substantially deprived of his right to cross-examine the plaintiff on material points.1</p>\n<p id=\"b840-14\">Defendant sought to show, while cross-examining plaintiff, that Margaret Curtin, the assignor to plaintiff of one of the claims in suit, was so old, feeble and infirm that she did not understand what was the import or effect of her alleged assignment to plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"797\">*797</page-number>tiff. The following questions were put to plaintiff, objected to, ruled out, and exception taken:</p>\n<p id=\"b841-4\">Q. \u201c Has your mother been able to walk any considerable distance in the past two years without assistance ?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b841-5\">Q. \u201cHas she been able to come out of the house, to your knowledge, during the last week ?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b841-6\">The assignment from Mrs. Curtin having been introduced in evidence, plaintiff was asked:</p>\n<p id=\"b841-7\">Q. \u201c Did you ask your brother, C. J. Curtin, before you went into the house, to be there that evening for the purpose of witnessing this assignment ?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b841-8\">Q. \u201c Same question asked as to Jennie Curtin ?\u201d (the other subscribing witness.)</p>\n<p id=\"b841-9\">Q. \u201c Did your mother tell you, at the time of the execution of this assignment, or at any time before that, that the defendant had some account against her, or to that effect?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b841-10\">Plaintiff having testified that he had conversations with his mother prior to the execution of the assignment, he was asked:</p>\n<p id=\"b841-11\">Q. \u201c Did they relate to anything more ? \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"APJ\">Plaintiff was also asked if he was present when his mother acknowledged the assignment; whether he was present at the time his brother signed the acknowledgment; whether he saw his brother write his name to the acknowledgment. All these inquiries were ruled out and exceptions taken to the rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-13\">Plaintiff and defendant were co-executors of their father\u2019s estate. While plaintiff was testifying to the items of his mother\u2019s alleged account, he testified in reference to an item of ten dollars, \u201c I considered it as money loaned to my brother.\u201d This question was then put: \u201c Q. It was money advanced by you as executor, as much your brother\u2019s as yours? Objected to. Objection sustained. Exception.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b841-14\">With reference to an item of forty-four dollars cash loaned November 11, 1885, the plaintiff was asked: \u201c Does your check-book show that you drew any money out of bank November 11, 1885 ? Objected to. Objection sustained. Exception.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b841-15\">A paper was shown to witness which he testified was in his handwriting. He was asked: Q. \u201cIs this a statement of the money that you acknowledged that you paid out on your father\u2019s estate ? \u201d \u201c Q. For what purpose did you make out this statement? \u201d \u201c Q. Did you pay your brother on the 4th of February, 1886, the sum of $29.89 ? \u201d \u201c Q. I call your attention to the item in this statement, 1 G\\ Mohr, driver, fifty dollars,\u2019 is that the amount that was paid the driver? \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b841-18\">All those questions were ruled out and exception taken to the rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"AqWF\">We think we have cited exceptions enough to the rulings of the referee that should be sustained to entitle defendant to a new trial, and the above form only a small portion of the questions that were erroneously excluded. We cannot assume that defendant was not injuriously affected by these rulings. All of the questians cited above were pertinent and material on the cross-cxami- ~ \" <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>might have brought out matters material to the defense, or tending to weaken the force of plaintiff\u2019s direct testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-2\">We are accordingly of the opinion that the judgment should be reversed and the order of reference vacated, with costs of this appeal to defendant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-3\">Clement, Ch. J., and Van Wyok, J,, concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
