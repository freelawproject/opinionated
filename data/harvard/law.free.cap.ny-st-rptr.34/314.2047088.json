Plaintiff brought a purchaser able and ready to pay the price demanded, the terms of sale were agreed upon and reduced to writing and signed by defendant, and part of the purchase-price paid. <em>Held, </em>that this was sufficient to entitle plaintiff to his compensation, and that his right thereto was not affected' by the fact that the consent of defendant\u2019s landlord was necessary to carry out the contract, or that the buyer afterward refused to carry it out.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b358-5\">Appeal from judgment of eighth district court in favor of plaintiff.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b358-6\"><em>James F. </em>Higgins, for resp\u2019t; <em>Michael J.

And by conclusive evidence it was established that plaintiff brought to defendant a purchaser who was able and ready to pay the price demanded by the seller; that the buyer and seller agreed upon terms; that a contract of sale was reduced to writing and signed by defendant, the seller; and that $100, part payment of the purchase price, was received and retained by the seller.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-10\">By all authorities this was sufficient to entitle plaintiff to compensation. <em>Sibbald </em>v. <em>The </em>Company, 83 N. Y., 378, 382; <em>Smith </em>v. McGovern, 65 id., 575; <em>Moses </em>v. Bierling, 31 id., 462; <em>Wall </em>v. <em>Co., </em>21 N. Y. State Rep., 105.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-11\">The fact that the carrying out of the contract was conditioned on the consent of the landlord and mortgagee, did not affect the completeness or validity of the agreement, but related only to the fulfillment of the contract; and that consent was duly obtained, so that no obstacle existed to the execution of the contract</p>\n<p id=\"b358-12\">True it is, that subsequently to the part payment, the buyer refused to carry out the agreement, but that was no fault of plaintiff. The inadvertent error in the notes was promptly corrected. Defendant has his redress against the buyer on the contract; and if more were needed to perfect plaintiff\u2019s right of action, that supplies it. <em>Barnes </em>v. Roberts, 5 Bosw., 73 ; <em>Glentworth </em>v. Luther, 21 Barb., 147; <em>Tombs </em>v. <em>Alexander, </em>101 Mass., 255 ; <em>Hunter </em>v. <em>Wetsell, </em>84 N. Y., 549 ; <em>Jackson </em>v. Tupper, 101 id., 515; <em>Mason </em>v. <em>Decker, </em>72 id., 595.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-13\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-14\">Daly, Oh.
