The objection was overruled. Thereafter the question was answered, but no exception was taken thereto. <em>Held, </em>that the error in the ruling was harmless.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b627-16\">Appeal' by plaintiff from a judgment in favor of defendant, entered on the verdict of a jury, and from orders denying plaintiff\u2019s motions <em>iov </em>a new trial on the judge\u2019s minutes and on the case.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b627-17\"><em>Fredlc. </em>(?. <em>Herter (A.

R. Co. </em>v. Ebling, 100 N.

Hurd, 86 N. Y., 547. The case does not disclose that the verdict was contrary to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">The later order appealed from denied a- motion for a new trial made upon the ground that a communication sent by the judge to the jury was erroneous, and in violation of the rights of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">It seems the jury while deliberating sent an inquiry to the court in the presence, of all counsel; the plaintiff\u2019s counsel thereupon objected to <em>any communication </em>between the court and the jury except by the recalling of the jury into open court; this objection, as calculated to preserve the conduct of the trial from irregularity, was doubtless proper, but it was overruled; no harm, however, came to the plaintiff by this ruling, for the question had not been answered. -</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">Thereafter the question was answered, no exception was taken to the answer, and no indication of dissatisfaction with respect to it appears upon the record; it is, therefore, fair to assume that, at the time it was given, the plaintiff was not averse to it because of incorrectness. If it was otherwise, he should in fairness have called the attention of the trial judge to his complaint, so that the answer could have been corrected, if cause therefor existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">The fact that the answer was not literally correct does not satisfy me that the plaintiff was prejudiced by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">A just inference from the question is that the jury desired to know whether the defendant had been paid by the plaintiff an amount equal to his wages up to the time of the formation of the corporation. If this was the information desired, the answer con-, veyed it.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">Upon the whole case, I think the judgment and orders should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-10\">Sedgwick, Oh.
