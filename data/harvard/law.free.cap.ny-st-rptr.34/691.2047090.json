Sec. 1709. Neither of these methods were resorted to in the present instance, and the plaintiff became entitled to receive and hold possession of the property until the final determination of the action. The defendant was not entitled to an order of interpleader under \u00a7 820 of the Code, because he did not tender into court the property claimed. Indeed, he had lost the right of possession, and could not deliver the property.- The plaintiff became <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"692\">*692</page-number>entitled to possession under the provisions of the Code, and the court could make no different direction concerning it. This view is in accord with the authorities. <em>Edgerton </em>v. Ross, 6 Abb. Pr., 189 ; <em>Vosburg </em>v. Huntington, 15 id., 254; <em>Lynch </em>v. <em>St. </em>John, 56 How. Pr., 144.
