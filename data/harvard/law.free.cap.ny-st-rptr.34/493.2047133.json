Proceeding to acquire title to lands for school purposes. The petitioner afterwards consented to discontinue but dispute arose as to costs. An order was made discontinuing the proceedings and dismissing the petition with fifty-five dollars costs, which order was affirmed by the general term and judgment entered upon \u25a0such affirmance.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b537-7\"><em>A.

Code \u2022Civ. Pro., \u00a7\u00a7 3343, subd. 20, 3333, 3334; <em>Libbey </em>v. <em>Mason, </em>112 N. Y., 525 ; 21 N. Y. State Rep., 914.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">Therefore we think the order of general term affirming the special term order in this proceeding was final, and that it was irregular to enter judgment upon such order. The costs should have been taxed by the clerk, and then inserted in the general term order. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 3262, 3266. We think the motion to vacate such judgment should have been granted; therefore the order denying the motion should be reversed, with ten dollars costs of appeal and disbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-10\">Clement, Ch.
