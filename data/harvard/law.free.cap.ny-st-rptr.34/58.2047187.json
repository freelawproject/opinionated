Wolf &amp; Son on a guaranty of payment, executed in the name of the defendant as guarantor. The guaranty so executed was signed by the wife of the defendant. The trial judge dismissed the complaint on the ground that no authority to bind the defendant was shown.

R. Co., </em>119 N. Y., 152; 28 N. Y. State Rep.; 944. Although the statute requires the guaranty to be in writing, it was not necessary that Mrs. Levy\u2019s authority to execute it as defendant\u2019s agent should also be in writing. Parol authority is sufficient, and it may be ?roved by oral testimony. <em>Worrall </em>v. <em>Munn, </em>5 N. Y., 229; <em>Dykers </em>v. <em>Townsend, </em>24 id., 57 ; <em>First National Bank </em>v. <em>Ballou, </em>49 id., 155.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-13\">The defendant told the plaintiffs that his wife would have charge of his business, that they could do business with her as they had with him, and that they could let her have whatever she wanted, and it would be all right On the defendant\u2019s return from Europe plaintiffs demanded payment from him, and he said if his wife would tell him that she had guaranteed the purchase, he would pay the bill. He asked for and was allowed to take the guaranty to show to his wife, presumably to ask her whether she did make it, and in a few days returned it with a letter, neither denying nor admitting his liability. The defendant offered to pay half of the claim before suit brought Taking this evidence as true, as we must on this appeal, it is clear that the jury would have been warranted in drawing the inference that Mrs; Levy had authority from the defendant to sign his name to the guaranty.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-14\">It is impossible to lay down any inflexible rule by which it can be determined what evidence shall be sufficient to establish an agency in any given case, but it may be said, in general terms, that whatever evidence has the tendency to prove the agency is admissible, even though not full and satisfactory, as it is the province of the jury to pass upon it. <em>Bickford </em>v. <em>Menier, </em>36 Hun, 446; <em>Heywood Co. </em>v. <em>Burns, </em>15 N. Y. State Rep. 570; <em>Leslie </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"59\">*59</page-number><em>Knickerbocker L. I. Co. </em>63 N. Y., 27, and see 52 Alabama, 606; 17 Maryland, 452. Apart from the question of original authority there was sufficient evidence of ratification to go to the jury. 1 Lawson\u2019s Eights and Eemedies, \u00a7 41; <em>Harrod </em>v. <em>McDaniels, </em>126 Mass., 415; <em>Cairnes </em>v. <em>Bleecker, </em>12 Johns., 300; <em>Jervis </em>v. <em>Hoyt, </em>2 Hun, 637; <em>Johnson </em>v. <em>Jones, </em>4 Barb., 369; <em>Stilwell </em>v. <em>Mutual Life Ins. Co., </em>72 N. Y., 392. The case ought to have gone to the jury, it was error to dismiss the complaint, and the judgment entered on such dismissal must be reversed and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-3\">McAdam, Gh.
