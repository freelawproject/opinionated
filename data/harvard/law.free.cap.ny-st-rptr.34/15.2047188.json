Y. State Rep., 212; and it was there held, that in the case mentioned the employee of the sub-contractor could not recover from the owner. The appellant in the present case, referring to <em>Hagan </em>v. <em>The American Baptist Home, etc., </em>urges as one of the reasons why his present application should be granted, that the decision in that case was by a divided court, the prevailing opinion being by Bookstaver, j. concurred in by Allen J. and dissented from by Larremore, Ch. J. It appears however that the opinion in the present case, also by Bookstaver, J., was concurred in by Larremore, Ch. J. <em>Hagan </em>v. <em>The American Baptist Home, etc., </em>is cited with approval by the general term of the supreme court, fifth department, in <em>Weisemair </em>v. <em>The City of Buffalo, </em>32 N. Y. State Rep., 755, the opinion being by Dwight, P. J., and concurred in by Macomber and Corlett, JJ., although the general term in the same department were unanimous in their opinion in <em>Vogel </em>v. <em>Luitwieler, Impleaded, etc., </em>23 N. Y. State Rep., 313, relied upon by appellants as containing a view contrary to that expressed by the general term of this court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>upon the appeal herein. While I do not agree with the appellants that the question in this case, and in <em>Hagan </em>v. <em>The American Baptist </em>Home, <em>etc., </em>was similar to that litigated in <em>Vogel </em>v. <em>Luitwieler, </em>it not appearing in the last-mentioned case that the contractor or sub-contractor had been fully paid upon the completion of their contracts, before the filing of the defendant Luitweiler\u2019s notice of lien for material supplied to the sub-contractor and at his request, I do believe that the question presented, in view of the many persons who may be affected by the vast and constantly occurring building enterprises in this city and elsewhere, is of sufficient importance to entitle it to be determined by the court of last resort.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-3\">The appellants should have leave to appeal to the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-4\">Daly, Oh. J., and Pryor, J., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
