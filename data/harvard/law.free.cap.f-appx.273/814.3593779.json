Stat. \u00a7 760.11. For the following reasons, we vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-19\">Bettis filed a six count complaint against Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, alleging gender discrimination under Title VII and the FCRA and violations of the PDA in connection with changes to the terms of her employment and her ultimate discharge. The court later granted Bettis\u2019s motion to amend her complaint to add one count under the FMLA.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-20\">On July 16, 2006, the court issued its order setting the pre-trial conference date for June 29, 2007, and advising the parties, <em>inter alia, </em>to be ready for trial any time after that date and that pre-trial stipulations were due by June 15, 2007. Dispositive motions were due April 30, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b841-21\">Toys \u201cR\u201d Us began its deposition of Bettis on February 6, 2007. Because Bettis had not submitted all the documents requested, the parties agreed to continue the deposition at a later date. When Bettis amended her complaint to include the FMLA claim, the parties agreed that this issue would be addressed at a subsequent deposition in March 2007. Bettis, howev<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"816\">*816</page-number>er, canceled the deposition a week before it was scheduled to occur.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-4\">During discovery, Toys \u201cR\u201d Us filed a motion to compel discovery requests, asserting that Bettis\u2019s responses to discovery requests had been inadequate, evasive, incomplete, and unresponsive.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Prior to filing the motion to compel, defense counsel attempted to resolve the discovery disputes with Bettis\u2019s counsel, and Bettis\u2019s counsel expressed an intent to supplement the responses. However, counsel failed to follow through. The district court ordered Bettis to respond to the motion to compel within ten days or the court would grant the motion. After receiving Bettis\u2019s response, the court then granted the motion to compel in part, ordering Bettis to file proper responses to two interrogatories by April 4, 2007. Per the court\u2019s order, Bettis submitted \u201cplaintiffs better answers to defendant\u2019s first set of interrogatories.\u201d Toys \u201cR\u201d Us did not consider the answers acceptable and filed a motion for sanctions for the failure to comply with the court\u2019s order. The court granted the motion for sanctions because Bettis failed to comply with the court\u2019s order to answer the interrogatories, and instructed Bettis to answer by May 1 or face contempt or dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-5\">Toys \u201cR\u201d Us moved (1) to compel Bettis\u2019s deposition, (2) for sanctions due to discovery violations, and (3) for an extension of time to file dispositive motions. The court granted the motion to compel the deposition, but denied the motion for sanctions and for an extension of time. The deposition was rescheduled for April 11, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-8\">Toys \u201cR\u201d Us then filed a motion for a protective order with respect to Bettis\u2019s fourth set of requests to admit, which included 399 requests, and the subsequent corrected version, which listed 375 requests. Toys \u201cR\u201d Us noted that the case was a single issue, \u201cgarden variety\u201d employment action, and that the requests were duplicative, overbroad, repetitive, and irrelevant. On April 30, 2007, the court granted a protective order with respect to the fourth corrected set of requests to admit, but otherwise denied the motion. That same day, Bettis filed her opposition to the protective order.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-9\">Toys \u201cR\u201d Us moved for summary judgment on April 30, 2007, and later amended the motion after it learned that Bettis had not disclosed her bankruptcy filing during her depositions. On May 2, 2007, the day after Bettis\u2019s responses were due, Toys \u201cR\u201d Us moved for relief due to Bettis\u2019s failure to respond to the court\u2019s order to answer the interrogatories, asserting that the response, which was received a day late, was still deficient. Bettis requested an extension to respond to the summary judgment motion, and the court granted the request, ordering Bettis to respond to the amended summary judgment motion by noon on June 11, 2007. On June 11, at 12:53 pm, Bettis filed her response.</p>\n<p id=\"b842-10\">Per the court\u2019s order at the beginning of the case, the pre-trial stipulations were due June 15, 2007. On June 14, Bettis filed a motion for extension of time.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Toys \u201cR\u201d Us responded that it had made several attempts to coordinate the pre-trial statement with Bettis\u2019s counsel, but that counsel had refused to respond and had waited <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"817\">*817</page-number>until the day before the statement was due to seek the extension. The court denied Bettis motion for an extension of time. The court then <em>sua sponte </em>issued a \u201cfinal order of dismissal,\u201d dismissing the complaint without prejudice for failure to comply with the court\u2019s order to set a pre-trial conference and to comply with Local Rule 16.1.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The court denied all pending motions as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-5\">Bettis now appeals, challenging the court\u2019s dismissal without prejudice, the decision granting a protective order on discovery requests, and arguing that the district court judge should have recused himself due to bias. She further asserts that, on remand, the case should be reassigned to a different judge. Toys \u201cR\u201d Us also challenges whether we have jurisdiction over the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-7\">A. Jurisdiction</p>\n<p id=\"b843-8\">Toys \u201cR\u201d Us argues that there is no final order disposing of all claims because the FCRA and FMLA claims can be refiled within the limitations period. According to Toys \u201cR\u201d Us, where a party seeks to appeal fewer than all claims, the district court must certify the appeal under Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b843-12\">We review <em>de novo </em>questions concerning jurisdiction. <em>Williams v. Chatman, </em>510 F.3d 1290, 1293 (11th Cir.2007). Where there is a question as to the court\u2019s appellate jurisdiction, we must address it before turning to the merits of the appeal. <em>Main Drug, Inc. v. Aetna U.S. Healthcare, Inc., </em>475 F.3d 1228, 1229 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-13\">Section 1291 provides the general rule that this court has \u201cjurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district courts of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Because the district court\u2019s order in the instant case disposed of all claims, we have jurisdiction. <em>Robinson v. Federal Nat. Mortg. Ass\u2019n, </em>673 F.2d 1247, 1249 (11th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b843-14\">B. Dismissal without prejudice</p>\n<p id=\"b843-15\">Bettis argues that although the court dismissed without prejudice, the fact that the limitations period has run on some of her claims makes the dismissal the equivalent of a dismissal with prejudice. She contends that the court failed to determine if lesser sanctions would suffice, and failed to consider whether there was a clear- record of willful conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b843-16\">We review dismissals under Fed. R.Civ.P. 41 for abuse of discretion.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> <em>Grat</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"818\">*818</page-number><em>ton v. Great American Communications, </em>178 F.3d 1373, 1374 (11th Cir.1999); <em>Go-forth v. Owens, </em>766 F.2d 1533, 1535 (11th Cir.1985). \u201cDiscretion means the district court has a \u2018range of choice, and that its decision will not be disturbed as long as it stays within that range and is not influenced by any mistake of law.\u2019 \u201d <em>Betty K Agencies, Ltd. v. M/V Monada, </em>432 F.3d 1333, 1337 (11th Cir.2005) (quoting <em>Guideone Elite Ins. Co. v. Old Cutler Presbyterian Church, Inc., </em>420 F.3d 1317, 1324 (11th Cir.2005)).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-4\">The district court possesses the inherent power to police its docket. <em>Link v. Wabash R.R. Co., </em>370 U.S. 626, 629-30, 82 S. Ct. 1386, 1388, 8 L.Ed.2d 734 (1962). Rule 41(b) authorizes a district court to dismiss a complaint for failure to comply with a court order or the federal rules. Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(b); <em>Goforth, </em>766 F.2d at 1535. As this court has explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b844-6\">[A] dismissal with prejudice, whether on motion or sua sponte, is an extreme sanction that may be properly imposed only when: (1) a party engages in a clear pattern of delay or willful contempt (contumacious conduct); and (2) the district court specifically finds that lesser sanctions would not suffice.... Moreover, the harsh sanction of dismissal with prejudice is thought to be more appropriate in a case where a party, as distinct from counsel, is culpable.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b844-9\"><em>Betty K Agencies Ltd., </em>432 F.3d at 1339; <em>Gratton, </em>178 F.3d at 1374; <em>Goforth, </em>766 F.2d at 1535.</p>\n<p id=\"b844-10\">Thus, dismissal under Rule 41(b) is appropriate where there is a clear record of \u201cwillful\u201d contempt and an implicit or explicit finding that lesser sanctions would not suffice. <em>Gratton, </em>178 F.3d at 1374; <em>see also Zocaras v. Castro, </em>465 F.3d 479, 484 (11th Cir.2006); <em>Goforth, </em>766 F.2d at 1535. Mere negligence or confusion is not sufficient to justify a finding of delay or willful misconduct. <em>McKelvey v. AT &amp; T Techs., Inc., </em>789 F.2d 1518, 1520 (11th Cir.1986). In general, where the plaintiff has been forewarned, dismissal following the plaintiffs disregard of an order is not an abuse of discretion. <em>Moon v. Newsome, </em>863 F.2d 835, 837 (11th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b844-11\">Here, although the court dismissed the complaint without prejudice, some of Bettis\u2019s claims would now be time barred;<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> thus the dismissal was in effect a dismissal with prejudice. When an order \u201chas the effect of precluding [plaintiff] from refiling [her] claim due to the running of the statute of limitations ... [t]he dismissal [is] tantamount to a dismissal with prejudice.\u201d <em>Burden v. Yates, </em>644 F.2d 503, 505 (5th Cir. Unit B 1981).<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b844-12\">After a thorough review of the record, we conclude that the district court abused its discretion by dismissing the complaint. Although the record is replete with instances in which Bettis\u2019s counsel failed to comply with court orders, and the court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>warned Bettis that the failure to comply could result in dismissal, there is no explicit finding that the conduct was willful and not mere negligence. And, based on the record before us, we cannot infer such a finding. Moreover, although the court imposed other sanctions, those sanctions were to compel discovery and did not include fines, contempt, or disciplinary actions against the attorney. Because the dismissal is, in effect, with prejudice, the district court abused its discretion, and we vacate and remand with instructions for the court to consider other sanctions.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-5\">C. Protective Order</p>\n<p id=\"b845-6\">Bettis next argues that the court abused its discretion by granting the motion for a protective order without waiting for her to file her response.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-7\">We review the district court\u2019s efforts to manage discovery for abuse of discretion. <em>Adkins v. Christie, </em>488 F.3d 1324, 1330 (11th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 903, 169 L.Ed.2d 785 (2008); <em>Burger King Corp. v. Weaver, </em>169 F.3d 1310, 1315 (11th Cir.1999). This court will reverse if it concludes that in limiting discovery, the district court \u201cmade a clear error of judgment ... or ... applied an incorrect legal standard.\u201d <em>Peat, Inc. v. Vanguard Research, Inc., </em>378 F.3d 1154, 1159 (11th Cir.2004) (citing <em>Alexander v. Fulton County, </em>207 F.3d 1303, 1326 (11th Cir.2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-10\">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(c) specifically provides that a party may file a motion for a protective order to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ajeb\">protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense, including ... including one or more of the following: (A) forbidding the disclosure or discovery; (B) specifying terms, including time and place, for the disclosure or discovery; (C) prescribing a discovery method other than the one selected by the party seeking discovery; (D) forbidding inquiry into certain matters, or limiting the scope of disclosure or discovery to certain matters.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b845-13\">Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(c)(1)(A)-(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-14\">Considering the court\u2019s inherent power to manage its docket, <em>Link, </em>370 U.S. at 629-630, 82 S.Ct. 1386, we conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion. Bettis submitted her fourth request for admissions, which contained 399 requests. She then submitted a corrected version, which contained 375 requests. The case involved a single issue employment claim and the requests were repetitive and sought irrelevant information.</p>\n<p id=\"b845-15\">With respect to whether there was an abuse stemming from the court\u2019s granting of the motion prior to receiving Bettis\u2019s response, there was no error. Neither the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure nor the Local Rules require the court to obtain a response from the non-moving party before ruling on a motion for a protective order. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 26; S.D. Fla. L.R. 26.1(H)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b845-16\">D. Recusal and Reassignment</p>\n<p id=\"b845-17\">Finally, Bettis argues that this court should assign the case to a different judge on remand because the district judge should have recused himself due on bias or the mere appearance of bias against working mothers in light of his connections to a conservative, Christian law school and other conservative organizations.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b846-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"820\">*820</page-number>1. Recusal</p>\n<p id=\"b846-4\">Because Bettis failed to seek recusal of the district court judge in the proceedings below by filing an affidavit pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 144, we review the judge\u2019s decision not to recuse himself <em>sua sponte </em>under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455 for plain error. <em>Hamm v. Members of Bd. of Regents of State of Fla., </em>708 F.2d 647, 651 (11th Cir.1988). \u201cTo disqualify a judge under \u00a7 455(a), the bias \u2018must stem from extrajudicial sources, unless the judge\u2019s acts demonstrate such pervasive bias and prejudice that it unfairly prejudices one of the parties.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>United States v. Bailey, </em>175 F.3d 966, 968 (11th Cir.1999). An adverse ruling does \u201c \u2018not provide a party with a basis for holding that the court\u2019s impartiality is in doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Byrne v. Nezhat, </em>261 F.3d 1075, 1103 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-5\">Here, there was no plain error in the judge\u2019s failure to <em>sua sponte </em>recuse. Bettis has established no bias \u2014 or even an appearance of bias. Moreover, a review of the record establishes that the court was even-handed in resolving the motions before it.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-6\">2. Reassignment on remand</p>\n<p id=\"b846-7\">This court has authority to reassign a case on remand. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2106 (1994); <em>United States v. Remillong, </em>55 F.3d 572, 577-78 n. 12 (11th Cir.1995). Three factors inform the decision to reassign a case on remand: \u201c(1) whether the original judge would have difficulty putting his previous views and findings aside; (2) whether reassignment is appropriate to preserve the appearance of justice; (3) whether reassignment would entail waste and duplication out of proportion to the gains realized from reassignment.\u201d <em>Chudasama v. Mazda Motor Corp., </em>123 F.3d 1353, 1373 (11th Cir.1997) (citation omitted); <em>see also CSX Transp., Inc. v. State Bd. of Equalization, </em>521 F.3d 1300, 1301 (11th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b846-10\">Considering these factors, we conclude reassignment is unnecessary. Notably, the facts Bettis relies upon to argue an appearance of impropriety were not before the district court. Rather, it seems that she is attempting to create an appearance of impropriety to further her request for recusal and reassignment. There is no appearance of impropriety. Moreover, this case has been pending for a significant length of time, and although the case is not complex, it would be a waste of judicial resources to reassign the case. Accordingly, we decline to order the case reassigned on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b846-11\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b842-6\">. We note that the record reflects that throughout the litigation, Bettis\u2019s counsel was uncooperative, failed to correspond with defense counsel or to respond to defense counsel\u2019s communications, and failed to comply with the court's orders. In addition, during depositions, Bettis\u2019s attorney repeatedly instructed Bettis not to answer questions, interrupted defense counsel, and coached the witness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b842-12\">. Bettis filed the motion after 5 p.m. on June 14.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b843-9\">. Rule 16.1 governs pre-trial procedure in civil actions. S.D. Fla. L.R. 16.1. This rule also requires the parties to file pre-trial stipulations. Rule 16.1 (E). The penalty for failure to comply includes dismissal. Rule 16.1(M).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b843-10\">. Rule 54(b) is inapplicable here. Under Fed. R.Civ.P. 54(b), \u201c[w]hen an action presents more than one claim for relief ... the court may direct entry of a final judgment as to one or more, but fewer than all, claims or parties only if the court expressly determines that there is no just reason for delay. Otherwise, any order or other decision, however designated, that adjudicates fewer than all the claims ... does not end the action as to any of the claims or parties and may be revised at any time before the entry of a judgment adjudicating all the claims....\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b). Here, the court adjudicated all the claims by dismissing the amended complaint without prejudice.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b843-18\">. The district court also has broad authority under Rule 37 to control discovery, including dismissal as the most severe sanction. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 37(b)(2)(C); <em>Phipps v. Blakeney, </em>8 F.3d 788, 790 (11th Cir.1993) (reviewing dismissal under Rule 37 for abuse of discretion). Rule 37 sanctions are intended to prevent unfair prejudice to the litigants and insure the integrity of the discovery process. <em>See Aztec Steel Co. v. Florida Steel Corp., </em>691 F.2d 480, 482 (11th Cir.1982).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b844-7\">. As the parties concede, the Title VII and PDA claims are time-barred. The FMLA claims either expired in 2007 or are still viable until August of 2008, depending on whether the two or three-year limitations period applies. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 2917(c). The only remaining claims are the FCRA issues, which enjoy a four-year limitations period. Fla. Stat. \u00a7 760.11(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b844-8\">.

After that date, however, only the decisions of the continuing Fifth Circuit's Administrative Unit B are binding on this circuit, while Unit A decisions are merely persuasive. <em>Dresdner Bank AG v. M/V OLYMPIA VOYAGER, </em>446 F.3d 1377, 1381 n. 1 (11th Cir.2006); <em>Stein v.
