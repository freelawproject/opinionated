Horn, which denied his applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Liu, You Zhong, </em>No. A97 957 381 (B.I.A. July 16, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A97 57 381 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Nov. 9, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">When the BIA does not expressly \u201cadopt\u201d the IJ\u2019s decision, but its brief opinion closely tracks the IJ\u2019s reasoning, this Court, for the sake of completeness, may consider the IJ\u2019s decision in reviewing the BIA\u2019s if doing so does not affect its ultimate conclusion. <em>Jigme Wangchuck v. Dep\u2019t Homeland See., </em>448 F.3d 524, 528 (2d Cir.2006). Here, the BIA \u201cagree[d]\u201d with the IJ\u2019s burden of proof findings and supplemented the IJ\u2019s reasoning by briefly discussing Liu\u2019s arguments on appeal. Accordingly, we consider the IJ\u2019s decision in reviewing that of the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>Manzur v. Dep\u2019t Homeland Sec., </em>494 F.3d 281, 288-89 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">As an initial matter, we decline to address the agency\u2019s denial of Liu\u2019s claims based on his illegal departure from China because he did not challenge that denial in his brief to this Court. In such circumstances, we deem the claim abandoned. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-10\">We find that the agency did not err in determining that Liu failed to establish eligibility for relief based on his alleged fear that the smugglers who financed his travel to the United States would harm him if he returned to China. The agency appropriately denied Liu\u2019s asylum and withholding of removal claims based upon this fear where he failed to establish a nexus between his fear and a protected ground. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1101(a)(42), 1158(b)(l)(B)(i). Likewise, the agency\u2019s dismissal of Liu\u2019s CAT claim was reasonable. The background evidence Liu submitted contained no specific information on torture inflicted by smugglers seeking repayment of debts. Moreover, the record supports the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Liu failed to demonstrate that the Chinese government was unable or unwilling to protect him from harm. Accordingly, Liu did not demonstrate his eligibility for CAT relief. See 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.18(a)(7); <em>Khouzam v. Ashcroft, </em>361 F.3d 161, 171 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-11\">As to Liu\u2019s claimed fear of persecution and torture based on enforcement of China\u2019s family planning policy, the record supports the agency\u2019s determination that he failed to establish his eligibility for relief where it establishes that Liu has only one child, his wife in China is not pregnant, and Liu does not even allege that his wife is attempting to conceive. The agency reasonably concluded in these circumstances that Liu\u2019s claimed fear \u2014 conditioned on his desire to have an additional child at some point in the indefinite future \u2014 was entirely speculative and provided no basis for relief. <em>See Jian Xing Huang v. INS, </em>421 F.3d 125, 129 (2d Cir. 2005) (per curiam) (purely speculative fear <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"112\">*112</page-number>of future harm cannot support right to relief). Accordingly, the agency\u2019s denial of Liu\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief was supported by the record.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">Por the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b138-15\">. Liu argues that we should remand this case because the BIA erroneously stated that his one child was bom in the United States rather than China. We decline to do so. The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s reasoning, which did not turn on where Liu\u2019s child was born, but on the speculative nature of Liu\u2019s claimed fear of future persecution due to his desire to have additional children. Moreover, the BIA did not make legal findings based on its misperception of the record. Accordingly, its decision did not contain a \"fundamental flaw\u201d warranting remand. <em>See Tian-Yong Chen v. INS, </em>359 F.3d 121, 127 (2d Cir.2004). Even if it did, remand in this case would be futile. <em>See also Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep't of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 339-40 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
