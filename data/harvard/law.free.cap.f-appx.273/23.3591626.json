Massaquoi, a native and citizen of Liberia, seeks review of a final order of removal entered by the BIA on August 21, 2006. <em>In </em>re <em>Massaquoi, </em>No. A79 720 831 (B.I.A. Aug. 21, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 full familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-9\">A petition for review of a final order of removal \u201cmust be filed not later than 30 days after the date of the final order of removal.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1). The BIA\u2019s decision in this case was issued on August 21, 2006, and Massaquoi\u2019s petition for review was thus due to this Court on September 20, 2006. By his own admission, Massaquoi did not file a petition for review in any court until March 22, 2007. The petition was thus filed well beyond the 30-day deadline.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-10\">We have held that compliance with the 30-day time limit for filing a petition for review of the BIA\u2019s final order is a jurisdictional prerequisite. <em>Ruiz-Martinez v. Mukasey, </em>516 F.3d 102, 118-19 (2d Cir. 2008); <em>Malvoisin v. INS, </em>268 F.3d 74, 75 (2d Cir.2001). Because Massaquoi\u2019s petition was filed out of time, we lack jurisdiction to consider it.</p>\n<p id=\"b50-11\">Accordingly, the petition for review is DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
