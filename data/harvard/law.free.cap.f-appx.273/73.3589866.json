Horn\u2019s September 12, 2006 decision denying her August 2006 motion to reopen her removal proceedings. <em>In re Tunkara, </em>No. A72 797 858 (B.I.A. July 11, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A72 797 858 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Sept. 12, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">When the BIA affirms the IJ\u2019s decision in all respects but one and supplements the IJ\u2019s decision, this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision as modified by the BIA decision, i.e., \u201cminus the single argument for denying relief that was rejected by the BIA,\u201d and as supplemented by the BIA. <em>See Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 522 (2d Cir.2005). We review the denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>See Kaur v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam). An abuse of discretion may be found where the decision \u201cprovides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or eonclusory statements; that is to say, where the Board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 93 (2d Cir. 2001) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">The agency properly denied Tunkara\u2019s August 2006 motion to reopen as untimely and number barred where it was filed a decade after the final order of removal was issued in her case and was her third motion to reopen. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(iii); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.23(b)(4)(ii) (an alien ordered removed <em>in absentia </em>may only file one motion to reopen and it must be within 180 days of the final administrative decision). Moreover, the agency did not abuse its discretion in finding that Tunkara failed to present material evidence of \u201cchanged circumstances arising in the country of nationality\u201d in order to satisfy the exception to this bar. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(ii). The BIA appropriately noted that nothing in the record indicated that conditions have changed in Gambia. Additionally, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in finding that the birth of Tunkara\u2019s children did not excuse the untimely and number barred filing where this Court has explicitly rejected the argument that changed personal circumstances in the United States constitute \u201cchanged circumstances arising in the country of nationality.\u201d <em>See Li Yong Zheng v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>416 F.3d 129, 130-31 (2d Cir.2005) (finding that the arrival of petitioner\u2019s wife in the United States and her pregnancy did not constitute changed country conditions in the petitioner\u2019s country of nationality).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">Additionally, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in finding that, even assuming personal circumstances were a basis for a motion to reopen, Tunkara failed to establish a significant change in personal circumstances based on the births of her daughters where she already had two daughters at the time she filed her asylum application. Tunkara has never argued or demonstrated how the birth of additional daughters would alter her eligibility for asylum where she claims to fear that all of her daughters would be subject to female genital mutilation if they were to return to Gambia.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-10\">This Court lacks jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision not to reopen Tunkara\u2019s case <em>sua sponte, </em>because such a decision is \u201centirely discretionary.\u201d <em>See Ali v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 518 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b101-11\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
