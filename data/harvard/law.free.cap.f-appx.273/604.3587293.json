Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-25\">Relying on <em>United States v. Medina Casteneda, </em>511 F.3d 1246, 1248-49 (9th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>Cir.2008), Johnson argues that the district court did not recognize its discretion to consider the disparity between crack and powder cocaine under the Sentencing Guidelines. However, the facts of this case distinguish it from <em>Medina Casteneda, </em>in which the district court stated: \u201c T don\u2019t believe it\u2019s appropriate for the Court to specifically reduce a sentence under 18 U.S.C. [\u00a7 ]3553(a) on the basis that the Congress and the U.S. Sentencing Commission are wrong in establishing different penalties for different types of controlled substances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">In this case, the government conceded at sentencing that the district court had discretion to consider the disparity between crack and powder cocaine under the Sentencing Guidelines. Nowhere did the court indicate that it lacked discretion to consider the disparity. The court\u2019s comment about Congress concerned minimum sentences, not the disparity between crack and powder cocaine. Further, the court properly considered evidence of Johnson\u2019s involvement with greater quantities of drugs and specifically referenced the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. During sentencing, the court stated: \u201cThe Court has considered the provisions of Title 18 United States Code Section 3553(a), that while [Johnson] was dealing narcotics it was at least shown to me based upon questions that they determined from phone taps that he was involved in much greater quantities than that which he was found.\u201d The court reasonably found that Johnson did not deserve a downward departure from the Sentencing Guidelines, and the court correctly recognized the advisory nature of the Sentencing Guidelines and that it had sentencing discretion. <em>See United States v. Kim-brew, </em>406 F.3d 1149, 1152 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">Although we find no error in the district court\u2019s actions, Johnson may still move the district court to modify his sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) based on the retroactive amendment to the Sentencing Guidelines that reduces penalties for crack cocaine offenses. <em>See </em>USSG \u00a7 1B1.10 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b630-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b631-9\">TASHIMA, Circuit Judge, dissenting:</author>\n<p id=\"b631-10\">I respectfully dissent because this disposition is contrary to binding circuit precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-11\">Johnson was sentenced to a 120-month term of imprisonment for possession of crack cocaine with intent to distribute. At the sentencing hearing, this exchange occurred between counsel for defendant and the court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-12\">[MR. SALSEDA:] Finally, Your Honor, we\u2019ve argued that the crack cocaine guidelines are overstated. One, they overstate this particular man\u2019s maliciousness. Two, they create unwarranted disparity. There\u2019s an unwarranted disparity between crack and pot or cocaine, and it\u2019s been shown this has a disproportionate impact on African-Americans. Specifically, if the same amount of cocaine base or cocaine powder and all things were the same, Mr. Johnson would be in a guideline range of 27 to 33 months.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-13\">THE COURT: Statistics don\u2019t show any difference really in terms of those matters which are when you compare what happens to Hispanics in terms of methamphetamine and cocaine, it just doesn\u2019t make any difference, or heroin, they\u2019re all the same. And the problem is that\u2019s a question for Congress to decide.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-14\">In <em>United States v. Casteneda, </em>511 F.3d 1246 (9th Cir.2008), the sentencing court similarly stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-15\">I don\u2019t believe it\u2019s appropriate for the Court to specifically reduce a sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>under 18 U.S.C. 3553(a) on the basis that the Congress and the U.S. Sentencing Commission are wrong in establishing different penalties for different types of controlled substances.... To the extent the difference in penalties are out of whack, it\u2019s for the Congress to change them, not this trial court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-4\"><em>Id. </em>at 1248-49 (alteration in the original). Based on the foregoing colloquy, because the sentencing court\u2019s \u201cstatements demonstrate^] that the district court did not foresee the extension of its <em>Booker </em>discretion that would be announced ... in Kimbrough,\u201d we vacated the sentence and remanded for the district court \u201cto reconsider the sentence in light of the Kimbrough decision and to determine whether the disparity between crack and powder cocaine produced a sentence \u2018greater than necessary\u2019 under \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1249.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">Given the similarity in circumstances, <em>Casteneda </em>controls this case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because I would vacate the sentence and remand for resentencing in light of <em>Casteneda, </em>I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b632-7\">. The majority attempts to distinguish this case from <em>Casteneda </em>by concluding that \"[t]he court\u2019s comment about Congress concerned minimum sentences, not the disparity between crack and powder cocaine.\u201d While it is true that some of the court\u2019s comments concerned statutory minimum sentences, immediately after those comments defense counsel correctly stated that \u2018\u2018in this case ... there\u2019s no mandatory minimum,\u201d to which the court replied: \"Well, I understand that,\u201d and moved on to other matters.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
