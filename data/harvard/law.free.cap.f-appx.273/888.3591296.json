Principi, </em>02-1661 (July 22, 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b915-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>The Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals denied an increased disability rating for Wesley R. Nesselrotte\u2019s service-connected post-traumatic stress disorder. The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims vacated the Board\u2019s decision and remanded the case to the Board, and the Secretary appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-5\">This case was stayed pending the court\u2019s disposition in <em>Roan v. Principi </em>2004-7093, which was stayed pending the court\u2019s disposition in <em>Sanders v. Nicholson, </em>487 F.3d 881 (Fed.Cir.2007), and its companion case <em>Simmons v. Nicholson, </em>487 F.3d 892 (Fed. Cir.2007). In <em>Sanders, </em>this court held that any 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5103(a) error should be pi\u2019esumed prejudicial and the Secretary has the burden of rebutting this presumption. <em>Id. </em>at 891.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-6\">The court agrees that summary affirmance of the judgment vacating and remanding to the Board is appropriate in light of our decisions in <em>Simmons </em>and <em>Sanders.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b915-7\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b915-8\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b915-9\">(1) The stay of proceedings is lifted.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-10\">(2) The judgment of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims is summarily affirmed. The case is remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b915-11\">(3) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
