TYMKOVICH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b775-7\">Petitioner Steffey asks this court for a Certificate of Appealability (COA) to appeal the district court\u2019s order dismissing his petition for a writ of habeas corpus filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. The district court denied Steffey\u2019s habeas petition as time-barred by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D). Steffey has not addressed the district court\u2019s decision on the time-bar, but rather reasserts his claims on the merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">We agree with the district court\u2019s holding that Steffey\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus is time-barred under \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D). Accordingly, his request for a COA is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-9\">I. Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b775-10\">In September 1996, Steffey escaped from an Oklahoma community work center where he was incarcerated. After his capture and return to custody, he received an additional sentence of four years for the escape. Under Oklahoma law, this conviction made Steffey ineligible for Level 8 or 4 earned credit status, designations which afford greater rights to inmates. In the years since the escape conviction, Steffey has committed a number of acts causing the assessment of additional misconduct points, including his participation in a prison riot on July 10, 2005 which resulted in the death of an inmate, further restricting his eligibility for more favorable earned credit status.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-14\">Proceeding pro se,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Steffey filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus on August 3, 2006, alleging, in the words of the district court, that \u201chis security points ... are being applied inconsistently and in violation of the prohibition against ex post facto laws ... [and that] his jail time in Mayes County should be applied toward his sentence.\u201d R., Doc. 46 at l.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Steffey claims these actions denied him eligibility for sentence reductions afforded by a higher earned credit status.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-15\">The district court found Steffey\u2019s claims to be time-barred under \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D), which provides for a one-year statute of limitations on habeas petitions. The district court took July 10, 2005, the date of Steffey\u2019s most recent reported misconduct, as the latest possible date to toll the one-year statute of limitations, rendering Steffey\u2019s claim time-barred as of July 10, 2006. Accordingly, Steffey\u2019s habeas petition filed on August 3, 2006 was untimely. The district court noted that Steffey subsequently filed a grievance on October 10, 2006 but the statute of limitations had already run, so it was not tolled by the late filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-16\">II. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b775-17\">The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA) conditions a peti<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>tioner\u2019s right to appeal a denial of habeas relief under \u00a7 2241 upon a grant of a COA. <em>Montez v. McKinna, </em>208 F.3d 862, 868-69 (10th Cir.2000). A COA requires the applicant to demonstrate a \u201csubstantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253. When the district court denies a habeas petition on procedural grounds, a COA should issue only when the prisoner shows that \u201cjurists of reason would find it debatable whether the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a constitutional right and that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595, 146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">Section 2244(d)(1) establishes a one-year statute of limitations for the filing of a habeas petition. Relevant here is subsection (D), which refers to \u201cthe date on which the factual predicate of the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D). The application of this clause depends on the factual circumstances of the underlying allegations. Based on the facts alleged here, we conclude Steffey\u2019s claim is time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">First, although the district court used July 10, 2005, the date of Steffey\u2019s most recent misconduct, the record discloses that the \u201cfactual predicate of the claim\u201d arose, at best, at a much earlier date. <em>Id. </em>Steffey\u2019s only contentions in his petition arise from the reduction of earned credits from the 1996 escape and his county court time prior to that.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The record shows no timely effort to administratively contest his classification status as a result of these incidents. In fact, the first recorded grievance arising from the 1996 incident was not filed until July 1, 2005. This cannot be considered timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-10\">Nor does Steffey contend he was unaware of the reduction in points or the adjustments to his earned credit level. To the contrary, the record shows a series of misconducts stretching back to 1998 where Steffey\u2019s earned credits were periodically adjusted pursuant to the prison\u2019s classification system. Given the nearly ten-year window between the escape incident and the filing of Steffey\u2019s habeas claim in the district court on August 3, 2006, his claim is barred by the one-year statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-11\">Second, we conclude Steffey did not take advantage of the administrative review process to toll the statute of limitations. In some situations, the \u201ctimely and diligent exhaustion of administrative remedies\u201d can provide a later date for tolling the statute of limitations. <em>Dulworth v. Evans, </em>442 F.3d 1265,1268 (10th Cir.2006). Where a prisoner \u201ctimely and diligently exhausts his administrative remedies,\u201d the effective date under \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(D) \u201cis the date that the denial of [the complainant\u2019s] administrative appeal becomes final.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1268-69. Nothing in the record indicates Steffey <em>timely </em>pursued and exhausted his administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-12\">Finally, Steffey does not qualify for equitable tolling. The one-year time-bar under \u00a7 2241(d)(1) may be subject to equitable tolling only in extraordinary circumstances. <em>Miller v. Marr, </em>141 F.3d 976, 978 (10th Cir.1998). Equitable tolling is appropriate where the time-bar \u201craises serious constitutional questions and possibly renders the habeas remedy inadequate and ineffective.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Here, however, Steffey <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>did not address equitable tolling in his brief, and the record shows his petition does not qualify. We see no reason why applying the one-year statute of limitations would raise \u201cserious constitutional questions\u201d or render the habeas remedy \u201cinadequate and ineffective.\u201d <em>See Slack, </em>529 U.S. at 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595 (\u201c[w]here a plain procedural bar is present and the district court is correct to invoke it to dispose of the case ... no appeal [is] warranted.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">For the reasons set forth above, Steffey\u2019s request for a COA is DENIED. Steffey\u2019s motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>is also DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b775-12\"> This order is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b775-19\">. Because Steffey proceeds <em>pro se, </em>we review his pleadings and filings liberally. <em>See Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520-21, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972); <em>Hall v. Bellmon, </em>935 F.2d 1106, 1110 (10th Cir.1991).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b775-20\">. Steffey complains that jail time in county jail prior to his state penitentiary incarceration should be applied towards his sentence.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b776-6\">. The district court looked to later incidents of misconduct, including the July 10, 2005 riot, none of which were raised by Steffey in the district court, nor in his briefs on appeal. These later incidents are not before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
