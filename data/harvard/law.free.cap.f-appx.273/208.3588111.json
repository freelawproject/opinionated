California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and a motion to withdraw as counsel. Because we agree that there are no non-frivolous issues in this appeal, we will affirm the conviction and sentence and grant counsel\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b235-23\">I. <em>Background and Procedural History</em></p>\n<p id=\"b235-24\">In connection with the armed robberies of four small businesses in West Philadelphia in October and December 2004, Skeeters was charged with one count of conspiracy to interfere with interstate commerce by robbery, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951(a) (Count One); four counts of interference with interstate commerce by robbery, and aiding and abetting, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1951 and 2 (Counts Two, Four, Six, and Eight); and four counts of possession of a firearm in furtherance of a violent offense, and aiding and abetting, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 924(c) and 2 (Counts Three, Five, Seven, and Nine). A jury found Skeeters guilty of all charges. The District Court sentenced Skeeters to concurrent terms of one month imprisonment on each of Counts One, Two, Four, Six, and Eight; a consecutive eighty-four month term of imprisonment on Count Three; and consecutive terms of 300 months imprisonment for each of Counts Five, Seven, and Nine, resulting in an aggregate prison term of 985 months. The District Court also imposed a five-year term of supervised release, $1,615 restitution, and a $900 special assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-4\">Skeeters timely appealed and was appointed counsel. His appointed counsel filed an <em>Anders </em>brief <em>(see Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967)) and a motion to withdraw on the grounds that there are no non-frivolous issues for appeal. In her twenty-four page brief, counsel identifies six issues that might arguably support Skeeters\u2019 appeal and discusses the relevant law: (1) denial of Skeeters\u2019 motion to suppress his statements; (2) denial of Skeeters\u2019 motion to suppress evidence seized pursuant to the search warrant; (3) fairness of the jury selection process; (4) conduct of the trial in a fair and impartial manner; (5) substantial evidence supporting the jury verdict; and (6) reasonableness of Skeeters\u2019 sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-5\">This Court then invited Skeeters to provide a brief addressing any reasons why his conviction and sentence should be overturned. Skeeters submitted an informal brief in which he raised an additional argument, that the government failed to prove the requisite \u201cinterstate commerce\u201d element in Counts One, Two, Four, Six, and Eight. We have jurisdiction over Skeeters\u2019 appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-7\">II. <em>Analysis</em></p>\n<p id=\"b236-8\">Under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), if counsel \u201cfinds [a] case to be wholly frivolous, after a conscientious examination\u201d of the potential issues for appeal, she should \u201cadvise the court and request permission to withdraw.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396. Such a request must be accompanied by a brief that \u201csatisfies] the court that counsel has thoroughly examined the record in search of appealable issues\u201d and \u201cexplain[s] why the issues are frivolous.\u201d <em>United States v. Youla, </em>241 F.3d 296, 300 (3d Cir.2001). On review, \u201cwe confine our scrutiny to those portions of the record identified by an adequate <em>Anders </em>brief\u2019 and \u201cthose issues raised in [the] Appellant\u2019s <em>pro se </em>brief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 301. We will grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw if counsel has met its obligation to examine the record for any arguable claim, <em>see McCoy v. Court of Appeals of Wisconsin, </em>486 U.S. 429, 442, 108 S.Ct. 1895, 100 L.Ed.2d 440 (1988), and we agree \u201cthat the appeal lacks any basis in law or fact.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 438 n. 10, 108 S.Ct. 1895.</p>\n<p id=\"b236-9\"> \u201cAn appeal on a matter of law is frivolous where [none] of the legal points [are] arguable on their merits.\u201d <em>Youla, </em>241 F.3d at 301 (internal quotations omitted). Our review of the record in this case confirms counsel\u2019s assessment that there are no non-frivolous issues for appeal. The denial of Skeeters\u2019 motions to suppress his statement and the evidence seized pursuant to the warrant were supported by the evidence. The record likewise does not support a claim that the jury selection process was not fair, or that the trial was conducted in other than a fair <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>and impartial manner. Furthermore, substantial evidence \u2014 including Skeeters\u2019 own admissions, as well as the testimony of his accomplice Angelika Jones and other witnesses \u2014 amply supports the jury\u2019s guilty verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-5\">With respect to Skeeters\u2019 sentencing, the District Court was required to impose twenty-five year minimum sentences, to run consecutively, on three of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924 counts. <em>See United States v. Walker, </em>473 F.3d 71, 75 n. 1 (3d Cir.2007). The District Court only imposed a one-month sentence on the predicate conspiracy and robbery offenses, such that the aggregate sentence was actually below the advisory guideline range. The record indicates that the District Court considered the issues raised in the presentence investigation report and by the defense. We find that the sentence imposed is reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-6\">Skeeters raises an additional issue in his brief, arguing that the government failed to establish that he interfered with \u201cinterstate commerce\u201d in committing the robberies. This argument is likewise frivolous. \u201c[A]ny interference with or effect upon interstate commerce, whether slight, subtle, or even potential, ... is sufficient to uphold a prosecution under [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951]----[A] jury may infer that interstate commerce was affected to some minimal degree from a showing that the business assets were depleted.\u201d <em>United States v. Haywood, </em>363 F.3d 200, 210 (3d Cir. 2004) (internal quotations omitted). The record includes testimony that each of the businesses robbed was involved in interstate commerce and that the assets of each business were depleted. Accordingly, the government established the requisite \u201cinterstate commerce\u201d element for the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951 convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b237-9\">III. <em>Conclusion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b237-10\">Because there are no non-frivolous issues for appeal, we will affirm the conviction and sentence and grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
