For the reasons below, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-12\">In 1994, Queen pleaded guilty to possession and distribution of heroin in the District Court for the District of Maryland. The District Court sentenced him to 360 months in prison. On Februaiy 1, 2008, 2008 WL 376299, Queen filed a \u00a7 2241 petition in the District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania. He alleged that his incarceration is unlawful because his criminal judgment was not executed. The District Court dismissed the petition, and Queen filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-13\">We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and exercise plenary review over the District Court\u2019s legal conclusions. <em>Cradle v. U.S. ex rel. Miner, </em>290 F.3d 536, 538 (3d Cir.2002). Under the explicit terms of \u00a7 2255, a \u00a7 2241 petition cannot be entertained by a court unless a \u00a7 2255 motion would be \u201cinadequate or ineffective.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In <em>Cradle, </em>we explained that a \u00a7 2255 motion is inadequate or ineffective only where the petitioner demonstrates that some limitation of scope or procedure would prevent a \u00a7 2255 proceeding from affording him a full hearing and adjudication of his wrongful detention claim. It is the inefficacy of the remedy, not the personal inability to use it, that is determinative. Section 2255 is not inadequate or ineffective merely because the sentencing court does not grant relief, the one-year statute of limitations has expired, or the petitioner is unable to meet the stringent gatekeeping requirements of the amended \u00a7 2255.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-15\"><em>Id. </em>at 538-39 (citations omitted). Queen has not shown that a \u00a7 2255 motion would be inadequate or ineffective. The District Court did not err in dismissing Queen\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-16\">Moreover, Queen\u2019s claims are without merit. Queen argues that his judgment and commitment order was not executed because \u201creturn portion,\u201d where the United States Marshal states that the defendant was delivered to the Bureau of Prisons (\u201cBOP\u201d), was not filled in. He claims that a BOP official later added a notation as to the day Queen arrived at the prison. Queen cites to no precedent and provides no explanation as to how the allegedly absent statement of his delivery to the BOP has affected his rights. He does not dispute that he arrived into BOP custody on February 27, 1995, or that he has been sentenced to 360 months in prison. Queen\u2019s arguments that he is a \u201csurety\u201d for the \u201cdebtor\u201d in his criminal case are frivolous and not deserving of further discussion.</p>\n<p id=\"b207-17\">Summary action is appropriate if there is no substantial question presented in the appeal. <em>See </em>Third Circuit LAR 27.4. For the above reasons, as well as those set forth by the District Court, we will sum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>marily affirm the District Court\u2019s order. <em>See </em>Third Circuit I.O.P. 10.6.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
