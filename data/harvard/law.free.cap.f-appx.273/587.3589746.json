We affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">First, Hughes argues that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence obtained pursuant to a warrant that was issued based on observations during a search of his car on July 7, 2005. Hughes contends that he did not freely and voluntarily give consent for the search, relying on <em>United, States v. Chan-Jimenez, </em>125 F.3d 1324, 1326-28 (9th Cir.1997). In considering the five voluntariness factors set forth in <em>Chan-Jimenez, </em>125 F.3d at 1327, we conclude that the district court did not clearly err when it found that, at the time Hughes gave consent, the encounter was consensual and Hughes was not in custody. <em>See United States v. Washington, </em>490 F.3d 765, 771-72 (9th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Mendez, </em>476 F.3d 1077, 1080 (9th Cir.2007); <em>United States v. Cormier, </em>220 F.3d 1103, 1110-11 (9th Cir. 2000); <em>United States v. Del Vizo, </em>918 F.2d 821, 824-25 (9th Cir.1990). We further conclude that the district court did not clearly err when it determined that, viewing the voluntariness factors under the totality of the circumstances, Hughes\u2019s consent was free and voluntary. <em>See Washington, </em>490 F.3d at 775-76; <em>United States v. Rodriquez, </em>464 F.3d 1072, 1077-78 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">Second, Hughes contends that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress the evidence from the initial entry into his Phoenix apartment on July 13, 2005. He argues that he withdrew his consent prior to the initial search. We conclude that the district court did not clearly err when it found that his intent to withdraw consent to search the apartment was not objectively clear and unequivocal when it was communicated to officers who had no reason to know that he had granted such consent. <em>See Florida v. Jimeno, </em>500 U.S. 248, 250-51, 111 S.Ct. 1801, 114 L.Ed.2d 297 (1991); <em>United States v. Gutierrez-Mederos, </em>965 F.2d 800, 803-04 (9th Cir.1992); <em>United States v. Brown, </em>884 F.2d 1309, 1311-12 (9th Cir.1989); <em>see also United States v. Sanders, </em>424 F.3d 768, 774-75 (8th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b615-8\">Third, Hughes challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support his convictions. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, we conclude that the trial record contains sufficient evidence to permit a rational trier of fact to find the essential elements of each crime beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See United States v. Naghani, </em>361 F.3d 1255, 1261 (9th Cir.2004); <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>229 F.3d 891, 894-95 (9th Cir.2000). The prosecution presented evidence that Hughes brought the silencer devices into his home, and that Hughes was familiar with silencers and their components. This evidence would allow a rational juror to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Hughes knowingly possessed unregistered silencers. The prosecution presented evidence that all of the components necessary to assemble a pipe bomb were in Hughes\u2019s apartment, with the exception of a fuse. The prosecution also presented evidence that Hughes knew how to use paper as a substitute for a traditional fuse. Therefore, a rational juror could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that Hughes knowingly possessed an unregistered destructive device in the form of components that could readily be assembled into a pipe bomb.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-9\">With respect to the third count, attempted production of a biological toxin for use as a weapon, the prosecution presented evidence that Hughes possessed instructions for the manufacture of ricin and all of the necessary equipment and materials to follow those instructions. The pros<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"590\">*590</page-number>ecution presented further evidence that Hughes\u2019s mortar and pestle and food dehydrator tested positive for castor bean DNA. Based on this evidence, a rational juror could find beyond a reasonable doubt that Hughes had taken a substantial step toward the production of ricin. The prosecution also presented evidence of books in Hughes\u2019s possession as well as internet searches on Hughes\u2019s computer which, combined with Hughes\u2019s own statements and other physical evidence, would permit a rational juror to find beyond a reasonable doubt that Hughes intended to use the ricin as a weapon. <em>Naghani, </em>361 F.3d at 1261; <em>cf. United States v. Baker, </em>98 F.3d 330, 337-38 (8th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-4\">Fourth, Hughes claims that the district court erred in denying his request for a special verdict on the count of attempted production of a biological toxin. Considering the instructions as a whole, we note that the court mitigated any risk of juror confusion by providing an explicit unanimity instruction for the substantial step element of the third count. We conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in denying the request for a special verdict on that count. <em>See United States v. Reed, </em>147 F.3d 1178, 1180-81 (9th Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Jessee, </em>605 F.2d 430, 431 (9th Cir.1979) (per curiam) (as amended).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-5\">Fifth, Hughes argues that the district court erred in its response to a jury inquiry. \u201cThe necessity, extent and character of additional [jury] instructions are matters within the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>United States v. Southwell, </em>432 F.3d 1050,1052 (9th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted; alteration in <em>Southwell) </em>(quoting <em>Wilson v. United States, </em>422 F.2d 1303, 1304 (9th Cir.1970) (per curiam)).</p>\n<p id=\"b616-6\">The question posed by the jury was expressly answered in the jury instructions. The jury asked: \u201cWhat is the definition of a weapon under law?\u201d The district court responded to the jury inquiry: \u201cThis definition is not an issue in the case. Please refer to the Court\u2019s instructions.\u201d The jury instructions spoke directly to the issue that the jury had to decide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b616-8\">To attempt to produce a toxin with the intent to \u201cuse as a weapon\u201d means to attempt to produce a toxin with the intent to use it to injure or harm another person or persons. The government does not have to prove an intent to kill another person or persons. Furthermore, intent to use as a weapon does not require the government to prove actual or attempted use of ricin.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b616-9\">The term \u201cuse as a weapon\u201d does not include the attempted production of toxin for a peaceful purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b616-10\">Hughes does not contend that this instruction was an improper statement of the law. At trial, defense counsel agreed that the inquiry should be answered by referring the jury back to the instruction already given. The disagreement as to the response was limited to the court\u2019s additional statement that \u201c[t]his definition is not an issue in the case.\u201d It appears that the district court may have understood the jury\u2019s question to concern the phrase \u201cweapon under law,\u201d rather than the single word \u201cweapon.\u201d The district court may have been mistaken in that understanding, but even if so, the court\u2019s response was not misleading. The charge against Hughes was attempted production of a toxin \u201cfor use as a weapon\u201d under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 175(a). The jury did not have to find that the ricin was a weapon, but rather whether the intent was to use it as a weapon. It was the phrase \u201cfor use as a weapon\u201d that was at issue, and the jury instruction provided all the information necessary to fully understand that phrase, so the court\u2019s response, which explicitly referred the jury back to the instructions, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>was not erroneous. The charge, taken as a whole, was not \u201csuch as to confuse or leave an erroneous impression in the minds of the jurors.\u201d <em>United States v. Petersen, </em>513 F.2d 1133, 1136 (9th Cir. 1975) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>Powell v. United States, </em>347 F.2d 156, 158 (9th Cir.1965)); <em>cf. Southwell, </em>432 F.3d at 1053. The district court did not abuse its discretion in responding to the jury inquiry.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-5\">Sixth, Hughes contends that his sentence was excessive. We conclude that the sentence was reasonable and that the sentencing judge sufficiently considered the factors listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) in applying the Sentencing Guidelines to Hughes\u2019s case. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>United States v. Mix, </em>457 F.3d 906, 912-13 (9th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Cantrell, </em>433 F.3d 1269, 1280 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b617-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b614-14\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b617-9\">WILLIAM A. FLETCHER, Circuit Judge, dissenting in part:</author>\n<p id=\"b617-10\">I dissent from the panel\u2019s memorandum disposition solely on the issue of the district court\u2019s response to the jury inquiry. I would reverse Hughes\u2019s conviction on Count Three.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-11\">The verdict form for Count Three asked the jury to determine whether Hughes was guilty of \u201cattempted production of a biological toxin (ricin) for use as a weapon.\u201d <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 175(a). Jury Instruction 16 listed the elements for Count Three. The instruction stated, in relevant part: \u201cTo attempt to produce a toxin with the intent to \u2018use as a weapon\u2019 means to attempt to produce a toxin with the intent to use it to injure or harm another person or persons.... The term \u2018use as a weapon\u2019 does not include the attempted production of toxin for a peaceful purpose.\u201d The parties do not dispute the correctness of this instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b617-13\">Less than two hours after the jury began its deliberations, the jury submitted a note to the court asking, \u201cWhat is the DEFINITION OF A WEAPON UNDER LAW?\u201d Meeting outside of the presence of the jury to discuss the note, counsel for both sides suggested that the court refer the jury back to the instructions. Then, the court on its own initiative suggested providing a more detailed response: \u201cI would suggest that, the definition requested is not a consideration in this case. Please refer to the instructions for \u2014 instructions regarding this case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b617-14\">The prosecution voiced no objection, but Hughes\u2019s attorney responded, \u2018Well, actually the definition requested is an issue in this case.\u201d The court disagreed: \u201cIt is not one of the issues in any of those instructions, what a weapon is under law. That\u2019s not a definition that they have to consider. They\u2019ve got what they have to consider.\u201d Hughes\u2019s attorney repeated her concern: \u201cJudge, I agree they have it in them instructions. However, it is an issue, specifically in Count 3.\u201d The court responded that \u201ca weapon under law is not a definition which is at issue.\u201d Hughes\u2019s attorney renewed her request that the court limit its response to \u201cplease refer to your instructions.\u201d The court responded by saying, \u201cI\u2019m going to give what I give. Again, you know, jurors that want to become lawyers are not \u2014 and it\u2019s not relevant. The instructions tell them what the law is.... As a matter of fact, I went back and cautiously looked at the instructions, and I didn\u2019t see any reference to, quote, weapons under law, unquote.\u201d The court then wrote its response on the jury note as follows: \u201cThis definition is not an issue in this case. Please refer to the Court\u2019s instructions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b618-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>\u201cWe generally review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s response to a juror inquiry. However, we review de novo whether a jury instruction correctly states the law, and whether an instruction violates due process.\u201d <em>United States v. Verduzco, </em>373 F.3d 1022, 1030 n. 3 (9th Cir.2004) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-4\">In reviewing a court\u2019s response to a jury inquiry, \u201cwe may infer from questions asked by the jury that it was confused about a controlling legal principle. If that is the case, we inquire into whether the trial court, by its responses or supplemental instructions, eliminated that confusion.\u201d <em>United States v. Walker, </em>575 F.2d 209, 213 (9th Cir.1978). \u201c[T]he district court has the responsibility to eliminate confusion when a jury asks for clarification of a particular issue.\u201d <em>United States v. Hayes, </em>794 F.2d 1348,1352-(9th Cir.1986). \u201cWhen a jury makes explicit its difficulties a trial judge should clear them away with concrete accuracy.\u201d <em>Bollenbach v. United States, </em>326 U.S. 607, 612-13, 66 S.Ct. 402, 90 L.Ed. 350 (1946); <em>see also United States v. Martin, </em>274 F.3d 1208, 1210 (8th Cir.2001) (\u2018When a jury explicitly requests supplemental instruction, a trial court must take great care to insure that any supplemental instructions are accurate, clear, neutral, and non-prejudicial.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>United States v. Beckman, </em>222 F.3d 512, 521 (8th Cir.2000))). In fulfilling this obligation, trial courts must use \u201cparticular care and acumen.\u201d <em>Verduzco, </em>373 F.3d at 1031. Courts have recognized the propriety of providing supplemental instructions \u201cin response to the jury\u2019s specific inquiry and for the purpose of clarifying legalistic terms to a lay jury.\u201d <em>Burrup v. United States, </em>371 F.2d 556, 559 (10th Cir.1967). A court may abuse its discretion where it \u201cmay have misunderstood the jury\u2019s question and therefore responded too narrowly,\u201d rather than \u201csimply direct[ing] the jury\u2019s attention to the totality of the instructions.\u201d <em>Arizona v. Johnson, </em>351 F.3d 988, 996 (9th Cir.2003) (discussing <em>Powell v. United States, </em>347 F.2d 156 (9th Cir. 1965)). \u201cThe ultimate question is whether the charge taken as a whole was such as to confuse or leave an erroneous impression in the minds of the jurors.\u201d <em>Walker, </em>575 F.2d at 213 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>Powell, </em>347 F.2d at 158).</p>\n<p id=\"b618-6\">I would hold that the court\u2019s statement that \u201c[t]his definition is not an issue in this case\u201d was sufficiently misleading as to require reversal of the jury\u2019s guilty verdict on Count Three. The jury\u2019s question strongly suggests that the jury was confused by a controlling legal principle\u2014 namely, whether and how a biological toxin might be created \u201cfor use as a weapon.\u201d <em>See Walker, </em>575 F.2d at 213; <em>cf. United States v. Riggins, </em>40 F.3d 1055, 1057 (9th Cir.1994) (noting that an object may be a dangerous weapon per se, based solely on the object\u2019s latent capabilities, or it may be a dangerous weapon based on the manner of its use). Count Three of the Verdict Form required the jury to determine whether the prosecution had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that Hughes had attempted to produce \u201ca biological toxin (ricin) for use as a weapon.\u201d Jury Instruction 16, which does not define \u201cweapon,\u201d but does define \u201cuse as a weapon,\u201d should have resolved that confusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b618-7\">The jurors undoubtedly were familiar with the ordinary definition of weapon. <em>See, e.g., </em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary 2589 (1993) (defining weapon as \u201can instrument of offensive or defensive combat\u201d). The verdict form, however, used the word in an unfamiliar context. The jurors\u2019 question indicated that they understood that ricin could not be used as a weapon in the ordinary sense of a knife, gun or club, and that they wanted to know the legal definition of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>term applicable in the case against Hughes. That is, their inquiry about the \u201cdefinition of a weapon under law\u201d was a request to the court to provide the legal definition relevant to this case. <em>Cf United States v. Rios-Calderon, </em>80 F.Sd 194, 196 (7th Cir.1996) (discussing a jury note requesting \u201ca definition of the words \u2018entrapment\u2019 and \u2018ensnarement\u2019 as it pertains to the law\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-5\">If a jury indicates that it is confused by an instruction, we must determine \u201cwhether the trial court, by its responses or supplemental instructions, eliminated that confusion.\u201d <em>Walker, </em>575 F.2d at 213. A trial judge responding to a jury inquiry must take into account the context from which the inquiry has arisen. <em>See, e.g., Bollenbach, </em>326 U.S. at 612, 66 S.Ct. 402; <em>Powell, </em>347 F.2d at 157-58; <em>see also Glaros v. H.H. Robertson Co., </em>797 F.2d 1564, 1571 (Fed.Cir.1986) (noting that the trial court must consider a jury\u2019s query \u201cin context,\u201d recognizing that the question may be \u201ca reasonable shorthand or lay manner of asking\u201d a relevant question). The district court disregarded the context in which the question was posed and failed to recognize the likelihood that the jurors were asking for a legal definition of the term \u201cweapon\u201d applicable to Count Three. Rather than eliminating the jury\u2019s confusion about the proper definition of \u201cweapon,\u201d the district court\u2019s response, at the very least, failed to clear up the confusion. In fact, it did something worse: it improperly directed the jury to ignore a critical and disputed element of Count Three. The jury instructions, as supplemented by the court\u2019s response to the jury\u2019s question, were \u201csuch as to confuse or leave an erroneous impression in the minds of the jurors.\u201d <em>United States v. Petersen, </em>513 F.2d 1133, 1136 (9th Cir.1975) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <em>Powell, </em>347 F.2d at 158).</p>\n<p id=\"b619-6\">The district court\u2019s error was not harmless. The court\u2019s answer \u2014 that the requested definition of \u201cweapon under law\u201d \u201cis not an issue in this case\u201d \u2014 in effect directed the jury to strike the last five words from Count Three and to relieve the prosecution of the burden of proving that Hughes had intended to produce the ricin for the purpose of harming others. This element of Count Three was the weakest aspect of the government\u2019s case. The government had presented no evidence that Hughes had ever harmed anyone in the past or that he had ever even expressed any motive or desire to harm anyone. Indeed, the government\u2019s expert testified that ricin has legitimate, non-criminal uses. The jury, lacking the requisite legal training to parse its own question and the court\u2019s response, most likely interpreted the court\u2019s statement to mean that there was no issue in the case regarding whether Hughes, if he did in fact attempt to produce ricin, actually intended to use it as a weapon. <em>See Bollenbach, </em>326 U.S. at 612, 66 S.Ct. 402 (\u201cThe influence of the trial judge on the jury is necessarily and properly of great weight, and jurors are ever watchful of the words that fall from him. Particularly in a criminal trial, the judge\u2019s last word is apt to be the decisive word.\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) (quoting <em>Starr v. United States, </em>153 U.S. 614, 626, 14 S.Ct. 919, 38 L.Ed. 841 (1894))). The answer therefore prejudiced Hughes. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cIf it is a specific ruling on a vital issue and misleading, the error is not cured by a prior unexceptional and unilluminating abstract charge.\u201d); <em>United States v. Southwell, </em>432 F.3d 1050, 1053 (9th Cir.2005); <em>cf. Walker, </em>575 F.2d at 214.</p>\n<p id=\"b619-7\">The conclusion that the trial court abused its discretion follows from our decision in <em>United States v. Petersen, </em>513 F.2d 1133. There, the defendant was charged with embezzlement of property of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>United States and conspiracy to defraud. <em>Id. </em>at 1134. The judge had instructed the jury at least twice regarding the meaning of the word intent, and in response to a note from the jury asking whether \u201cignorance of the law [is] any excuse,\u201d the judge responded in writing that \u201cignorance of the law is not an excuse.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1135. We held that the response to the jury inquiry was \u201cerroneous, misleading and contradictory,\u201d because ignorance of the law was relevant \u201cin determining whether there existed the specific intent necessary for a violation of the law charged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court found that \u201c[w]hile the principle has often been stated by the courts that ignorance of the law is no excuse, its use in the circumstances of this case was at least misleading to the jury\u201d and \u201cmay have caused the jury to eliminate it as a factor affecting specific intent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The court found that even if the instruction was not \u201cclearly incorrect,\u201d it was \u201cat least misleading on a vital issue in the case.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b620-4\">We have previously recognized that \u201c[fjailure to provide the jury with a clarifying instruction when it has identified a legitimate ambiguity in the original instructions is an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>See Southwell, </em>432 F.3d at 1053. Our conclusion should be no different when the jury instructions are clear, but a jury\u2019s inquiry demonstrates juror confusion and the court\u2019s response creates a palpable risk that the jury will disregard those instructions and mis-apply the law.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">I would therefore reverse Hughes\u2019s conviction on Count Three.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
