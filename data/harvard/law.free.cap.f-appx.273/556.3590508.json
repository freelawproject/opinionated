The petition for rehearing is therefore granted, and Pacheco-Gonzales\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 924(c)(1) is reversed. Because this means that all convictions of both defendants have been reversed, there is no longer any occasion for a remand to the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
