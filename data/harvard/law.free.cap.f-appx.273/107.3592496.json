Videla, denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Emad Nabil Locka, </em>No. A97 152 956 (B.I.A. Mar. 20, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A97 152 956 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Aug. 24, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-13\">When the BIA issues an opinion that fully adopts the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See Chun Gao v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 122, 124 (2d Cir.2005). Moreover, when the BIA agrees with the IJ\u2019s conclusion that a petitioner is not credible and, without rejecting any of the IJ\u2019s grounds for decision, emphasizes particular aspects of that decision, we review both the BIA\u2019s and IJ\u2019s opinions. <em>Yun-Zui Guan v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 391, 394 (2d Cir.2005). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004), overruled in part on other grounds by <em>Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 305 (2d Cir.2007) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-14\">As a preliminary matter, because Locka\u2019s brief to this Court failed to challenge the agency\u2019s pretermission of his asylum application and its denial of his CAT claim, we deem any such arguments waived. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b134-15\">Regarding Locka\u2019s withholding of removal claim based on his past experi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>enees, we find that substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination. For example, the omission from his written statement of the Egyptian state security officer\u2019s threat of detention was \u201cmaterial\u201d to his claim of religious persecution because it related to the government\u2019s alleged unwillingness to protect him from Islamic extremists. <em>See Zhou Yun Zhang, </em>386 F.3d at 74; <em>Ivanishvili v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>433 F.3d 332, 342 (2d Cir.2006) (\u201c[I]t is well established that private acts may be persecution if the government has proved unwilling to control such actions.\u201d). Similarly, based on the fact that Locka testified that the threat of detention dissuaded him from filing an official report of the June 1997 incident, this omission was \u201csubstantial\u201d when measured against the record as a whole. <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 308-09 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">In addition, while Locka testified that he stayed in the homes of various friends and relatives because he was in danger after the June 1997 incident, the omission of this detail from his written statement was material to his alleged fear of harm on account of his religious beliefs. <em>See Zhou Yun Zhang, </em>386 F.3d at 74. Furthermore, given Locka\u2019s own admission that this was a significant detail, the omission was \u201csubstantial\u201d when measured against the record as a whole. <em>Secaida-Rosales, </em>331 F.3d at 308-09.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">Although Locka offered explanations for these omissions, no reasonable adjudicator would have been compelled to accept them. <em>Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 80-81 (2d Cir.2005). As to the agency\u2019s other credibility findings, no error alleged by Locka would (even if found) induce us to disturb the adverse credibility determination, as it can be confidently predicted that the agency would reach the same conclusion on remand. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 335 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b135-9\">A withholding of removal claim premised on objective evidence of future persecution \u201cmay, in appropriate instances, be sustained even though an IJ ... has found not credible the applicant\u2019s testimony alleging past persecution.\u201d <em>Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006). Here, however, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s conclusion that the record evidence did not establish that it was more likely than not that Locka would be harmed in Egypt on account of his religious beliefs. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.16(b)(1) (withholding of removal). The IJ noted that while the U.S. State Department\u2019s 2004 Report on Human Rights Practices in Egypt stated that there were tensions between the Coptic Christian minority and the Muslim majority, there were no recent reports of violent attacks against Christians in Egypt. While Locka points to record evidence suggesting that such attacks have occurred in the past, this evidence does not compel a finding contrary to the IJ\u2019s.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B). Accordingly, the agency\u2019s denial of his withholding claim was not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b135-7\">. In addition, it was not improper for the IJ to note that Locka\u2019s fear of future harm was undermined by the fact that his father remained in Egypt without apparent incident and, according to Locka, attended church each week. <em>See Melgar de Torres v. Reno, </em>191 F.3d 307, 313 (2d Cir.1999). <em>But see Uwais v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>478 F.3d 513, 519 (2d Cir. 2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
