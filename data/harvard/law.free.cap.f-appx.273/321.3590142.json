We AFFIRM the sentence as reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b348-14\">L FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b348-15\">On June 15, 2006, Carlos Wilmer Palacios was indicted in the Eastern District of Louisiana on a charge of reentering the United States illegally following deportation, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(2).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Palacios had been deported on five prior occasions, two of which followed convictions for criminal offenses.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In particular, on September 24, 1997, he was deported after pleading guilty to a Utah drug offense and serving a forty-four-day sentence (the \u201cUtah drug conviction\u201d). In 2003, he was discovered in the United States, and he pleaded guilty in the Southern District of Mississippi to illegally reentering the United States after deportation (the \u201cMississippi reentry conviction\u201d). He was sentenced to twenty-eight months in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>prison and a three-year term of supervised release based on a \u00a7 1326(b)(2) enhancement for being an alien with a prior aggravated felony conviction. Palacios was again deported on May 28,2005.</p>\n<p id=\"Acc\">On August 9, 2006, Palacios pleaded guilty to the illegal reentry charge in this case without the benefit of a plea agreement. Before the district court accepted Palacios\u2019s plea, it instructed him that he was pleading guilty to illegal reentry in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(2) and listed the elements of the offense, The elements did not include a previous conviction for an aggravated felony; however, the district court informed Palacios that for the maximum prison term of twenty years to apply, the Government <em>must show </em>a prior aggravated felony conviction, The district court informed Palacios that in the absence of such a showing, the maximum term of imprisonment would be two years. Thereafter, Palacios entered his guilty plea. Palacios and his attorney also signed a Factual Basis that stated, in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Aav\">Palacios was deported following a 2003 conviction in the Southern District of Mississippi ... for a violation of Title 8, United States Code, Section 1326(a)(2) and (b)(2) to wit: being an <em>aggravated fehu </em>who having been previously deported reentered the United States without consent of the Attorney General.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Afum\">(Emphasis added). Palacios confirmed at his rearraignment that he had read, understood, and agreed with the contents of the Factual Basis.</p>\n<p id=\"AqV4\">A Presentence Investigation Report (the \u201cPSR\u201d) was subsequently prepared. The PSR described the Utah drug conviction as \u201cattempted distribution of a controlled substance,\u201d a felony drug trafficking offense, permitting a twelve-level sentence enhancement under the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>See </em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual (\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d) \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(B) (2006). This twelve-level enhancement was added to the base offense level of eight already assigned to Palacios. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2L1.2(a). After a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, <em>see </em>\u00a7 3E1.1(b), Palacios received a total offense level of seventeen and a resulting recommended Guidelines range of thirty-seven to forty-six months of imprisonment. <em>&amp;ee </em>\u00a7 5A, Sentencing Table. At the sentencing hearing, the district court first asked Palacios whether he had read and understood the PSR, and Palacios confirmed that he had. The district court then asked whether Palacios had any questions regarding the contents of the PSR, to which Palacios responded, \u201cNo, sir, I don\u2019t, sir.\u201d After overruling an objection by Palacios that is unrelated to this appeal, the district court asked one final time: \u201cDoes any party wish to make any other corrections, alterations, additions or objections to the PS[R]?\u201d Counsel for Palacios and the Government both responded in the negative. The district court adopted the find-in\u00a3s \u00b0t the PSR and sentenced Palacios to forty-four months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"Aj7-\">PaladoB thereafter appealed this sentencej arguing that the disfcrict court erred in relying on the PgR&gt;s characterization of the utah drug conviction as a drug traf_ fiddng offense to enhance the Guidelines range He asserted that the utah drug conviction was for simple possession of a controlled substance, not attempted distributton of a controlled substance. Because simple possession is not considered a drag trafficking offense under \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(B), <em>see United States v. Caicedo-Cuero, </em>312 F.3d 697, 707 (5th Cir.2002), Palacios urged that the enhancement was unwarranted. Palacios supplemented the record on appeal with three documents related to the Utah conviction: (1) the bill of information, which charged Palacios under Utah Code Ann. \u00a7 58-37-8(1)(a)(ii) with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"324\">*324</page-number>\u201cunlawful distribution, offering, agreeing, consenting or arranging to distribute a controlled or counterfeit substance\u201d; (2) the judgment of conviction for \u201cattempted possession\u201d; and (3) the docket sheet, which stated that Palacios had pleaded guilty to attempted distribution. The Government correspondingly supplemented the record with three documents from the Mississippi reentry conviction: (1) an indictment charging Palacios with illegal reentry and stating that Palacios had \u201cpreviously been convicted ... of Attempted Distribution of a Controlled Substance\u201d; (2) a judgment indicating that Palacios pleaded guilty to the Mississippi indictment, and (3) a memorandum of understanding Palacios signed acknowledging that the maximum penalty for the Mississippi reentry violation was a prison term or twenty years (the statutory maximum for someone who has previously committed an aggravated felony).</p>\n<p id=\"AmmU\">Applying a plain error r<em>evi</em>ew, this court held that the district court committed clear and obvious error when it relied on the PSR\u2019s characterization of the Utah drug conviction. <em>United States v. Palacios, </em>239 FedAppx. 57, 59 (5th Cir. 2007). We noted that to determine whether a prior conviction is a drug trafficking offense, the district court may consider \u201c \u2018the statutory definition, charging document, written plea agreement, transcript of plea colloquy, and any explicit factual finding by the trial judge to which the defendant assented.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Shep</em>ard <em>v. United States, </em>544 U.S. 13, 16, 125 S.Ct. 1254, 161 L.Ed.2d 205 (2005)). Because we found that \u201cthe state court judgment and information are too ambiguous to show whether Palacios was convicted of a drug trafficking offense,\u201d we vacated the sentence and remanded for development of the record and resentencing. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AXG\">On remand, the documents added to the record on appeal were specifically introduced. The district court held a resentencing hearing at which Palacios admitted that the Utah drug conviction stemmed from an incident in which he obtained cocaine from a friend for a female undercover agent he met at a bar; however, he stated that he was allowed to plead to possession. Palacios claimed that he had no^ objected to the characterization of his conviction during his prior sentencing hearinS or his meSal reentry Proceedings because no one had explained to him the leSal distinction between a conviction for tempted possession and a conviction for tempted distribution for the purpose of sentence enhancements. Palacios also urged the district court to consider, when imposing the sentence, his need to return to El Salvador to support his family and , his exemplary conduct m building and repairing homes in New Orleans,</p>\n<p id=\"A-4V\">In a ruling issued from the bench, the district court found that the twelve-level sentence enhancement initially given to Palacios was supported by the evidence. Citing <em>United </em>States v. <em>Martinez-Vega, 471 </em>F. 3d 559 <em>(5th </em>Cir.2006), and <em>Kemph v. Estelle, </em>621 F 2d 162 (5th cir.1980), the district court emphasized that it could use all the facts admitted by a defendant, and that a defendant could not stipulate to certain facts before the court and then attempt to deny or evade those stipulations. Although the district court stated that it had considered \u201cthe various <em>Shepard </em>approved documents,\u201d it did not discuss them. It concluded that the twelve-level sentence enhancement was proper \u201cconsidering [Palacios\u2019s] guilty plea, his prior federal conviction for the same aggravated felony, and his admission to the facts in the PSR.\u201d The district court re-sentenced Palacios to forty-four months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"AJq\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>The district court also gave an alternative basis for its sentence. Taking note of Palacios\u2019s contention that the proper Guidelines range should have been fifteen to twenty-one months,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> the district court stated that even under this lower Guidelines range, it would impose a forty-four-month sentence as an upward departure, It cited the likelihood of recidivism, given Palacios\u2019s previous deportations and illegal reentries. The court also noted that the longer sentence would reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, provide just punishment, afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct, and protect the public. Judgment was entered on September 14, 2007, and Palacios filed a notice of appeal the same day.</p>\n<p id=\"Aok\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"AMyR\">Palacios challenges the district court\u2019s decision to apply a twelve-level sentence enhancement to calculate the Guidelines range, arguing that the Government failed to establish that he had a prior conviction for an aggravated felony. Palacios maintains that he neither admitted nor waived his objection to the characterization of the Utah drug conviction as attempted distributton, a drug trafficking offense and an aggravated felony under the Guidelines, by pleading guilty to illegal reentry in this case or earlier in the Mississippi reentry case. Specifically, Palacios submits that: (1) at the rearraignment in this case, the district court did not include a prior conviction for an aggravated felony as an element of the offense but rather stated the government would have to prove it at sen-fencing; (2) at the time of the Mississippi rearraignment in 2003, the Supreme Court had not yet decided <em>Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>549 U.S. 47, 127 S.Ct. 625, 166 L.Ed.2d 462 (2006), which clarifies the distinction between distribution and possession for purposes of the \u201caggravated felony\u201d classification; and (3) his failure to object to the PSR did not constitute an affirmative assent to its contents. In addition, Palacios challenges the district court\u2019s alternative grounds for the forty-four-month sentence, arguing that the district court gave too much weight to his criminal history and disregarded several mitigating factors without explanation.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AfP\">Our review of sentencing decisions is limited to determining whether they are \u2018reasonable.\u2019 \u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>- U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). \u201cRegardless of whether the sentence imposed is inside or outside the Guidelines range,\u201d the sentence is reviewed under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>Id. </em>at 597. Because we conclude that the district court\u2019s alternative sentence for Palacios constituted a reasonable departure from the Guidelines, we do not need to reach Palacios\u2019s first point of error \u2014 the issue of waiver. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Klups, </em>514 F.3d 532, 536 (6th Cir.2008) (post-Gall) (concluding that the district court\u2019s alternative sentence based on the factors outlined in \u00a7 3553(a) eonstituted a reasonable variance from the Guidelines and thus not reaching the issue of upward departure).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"326\">*326</page-number>Initially, we examine whether the district court committed any significant procedural error, \u201csuch as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the [18 U.S.C.] \u00a7 3553(a) factors,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence\u2014including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597. In surveying for procedural error, we still review the \u201c \u2018district court\u2019s interpretation or application of the Sentencing Guidelines ... de novo, and its factual findings ... [ ] for clear error. There is no clear error if the district court\u2019s finding is plausible in light of the record as a whole.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751 (5th Cir. 2008) (post-Gall) (quoting <em>United States v. Juarez-Duarte, </em>513 F.3d 204, 208 (5th Cir. 2008)). Then, \u201c[assuming that the district court\u2019s sentencing decision is procedurally sound, [we] consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-4\">Further, even if the district court imposed a sentence outside the Guidelines range, we may not apply a presumption of unreasonableness. <em>Id. </em>The extent of the deviation may be considered, but we \u201cmust give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>That we \u201cmight reasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate\u201d is an insufficient justification for reversal of the district court. <em>Id. </em>This is because the sentencing judge is in a superior position to evaluate the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, given that \u201c[t]he judge sees and hears the evidence, makes credibility determinations, has full knowledge of the facts and gains insights not conveyed by the record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 597 (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-12\">Here, in imposing the alternative sentence, the district court committed no significant procedural error. According to the district court, the forty-four-month prison term represented a warranted upward departure from the lower Guidelines range of fifteen to twenty-one months urged by Palacios. This lower Guidelines range is calculated by assuming that Palacios\u2019s Utah drug conviction was for mere possession, a fact that Palacios clearly admits and the judgment of conviction explicitly states. Finding no errors in this calculation,<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"327\">*327</page-number><footnotemark>6</footnotemark> we further note that the district court allowed both parties to present arguments as to what they believed the appropriate sentence should be, considered several of the relevant \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and sufficiently documented its reasoning. Specifically, the district court discussed Palacios\u2019s history and characteristics, as directed by \u00a7 3553(a)(1), at some length. The court also mentioned that its upward departure was supported under \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A), stating that \u201cthe sentence reflects the seriousness of the offense, [ ] promotes respect for the law, [and] provides just punishment.\u201d The court addressed other factors as well. After considering \u201cthe likelihood that [Palacios] would commit other crimes,\u201d given that Palacios \u201chas previous convictions for illegal reentry after deportation and has been deported on at least three separate occasions,\u201d the district court noted that the sentence \u201caffords adequate deterrence\u201d and \u201cprotects the public.\u201d <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B)-(C).</p>\n<p id=\"AZJ\">However, Palacios claims that the district court\u2019s examination of his proffered mitigating factors was unsatisfactory. Palacios maintains that the following should have weighed in favor of a lighter sentence: his need to return to El Salvador to support his family; his exemplary conduct while in the United States, as evidenced by letters from homeowners praising his work in rebuilding after Hurricane Katrina; his long-term connection to the United States, including that he grew up here and has two adult children attending school in California; and his vow not to return to the United States. We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"AhK5\">The district court need only \u201cset forth enough [reasons] to satisfy the appellate court that [it] has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising [its] own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Contrary to Palacios\u2019s assertions, the district court adequately addressed his mitigating factors. In particular, the district court discussed Palacios\u2019s claim that he needed to return to his wife and three children in El Salvador, stating, \u201cThe fact that [Palacios] has been deported at least once already tends to undercut the argument that he cannot be incarcerated here because he would so desire to return to his family.\u201d The court further noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AzS\">the problem in this particular case is that [Palacios] does have some history of disregarding the laws of the country. In addition to the reentry issue.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This is not the first time he has been here and the subject of deportation proceedings. So, you know, this is not your usual case of someone who entered the country in order to make a living and send money back home in order to feed his family.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AJG\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"328\">*328</page-number>The district court also took into account Palacios\u2019s positive characteristics, mentioning that it had received and reviewed the letters submitted on his behalf.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> And although Palacios\u2019s assertion that he returned to the United States because he was reared here and has adult children here provides a fairly innocuous explanation for his repeated illegal reentries, his close connections to the United States also make it more likely he would desire to reenter in the future, despite his vow never to return, thereby increasing the need for specific deterrence in this case.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">Given the deferential abuse of discretion standard of review, we conclude that the forty-four-month alternative sentence was reasonable. The district court committed no significant procedural error and sufficiently explained that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on the whole, justified the sentence. <em>See Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 602 (\u201cOn abuse-of-discretion review, the Court of Appeals should [ ] give[ ] due deference to the District Court\u2019s reasoned and reasonable decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on the whole, justified the sentence.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of conviction and sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b348-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b348-9\">. Specifically, Count One charged that \u201c[o]n or about May 31, 2006, [Palacios] ..., an alien who had previously been removed and deported from the United States, was knowingly and unlawfully found in the United States in Orleans Parish, Louisiana, without the Attorney General of the United States or his designated successor, the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security .... having expressly consented to [Palacios\u2019s] reapplication for admission into the United States.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b348-17\">. The dates of Palacios\u2019s prior deportations are as follows: January 4, 1979; August 26, 1980; April 12, 1995; September 24, 1997; July 12, 1999; and May 28, 2005.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"A0F\">. This would have been the Guidelines range if the Utah drug conviction was considered a mere possession offense. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(D). The statutory maximum would have been ten years. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"AxZC\">. Palacios also argues that the district court erred by imposing an upward departure without providing advance notice, but he acknowledges that this argument is foreclosed by this circuit's precedent. <em>See United States v. Mejia-Huerta, </em>480 F.3d 713, 723 (5th Cir.2007) (\"[W]e conclude that sentencing courts are not required to give pre-sentencing notice of their <em>sua </em>sponte intention to impose a non-Guidelines sentence. ).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b352-5\">. Section 3553(a) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b352-6\">(a) Factors to be considered in imposing a sentence.\u2014The court shall impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes set forth in paragraph (2) of this subsection.

As earlier noted, the base offense level for Palacios is eight. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(a). Assuming the Utah drug conviction was for possession, the appropriate enhancement to the base offense level would be four. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(1)(D). After deduction of two levels for acceptance of responsibility, \u00a7 3E1.1(a), the total offense level would be ten. Combined with a criminal history category of IV, as stated in the PSR, an offense level of ten yields a Guidelines range of fifteen to twenty-one months. <em>See </em>\u00a7 5A, Sentencing Table.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"AZVfG\">. The district court was apparently referring to Palacios\u2019s Utah drug conviction and a 2002 conviction for false pretenses arising out of an incident in which Palacios obtained a $1,000 refund by cancelling a money wire without the authorization of the victim. The money wire conviction led to the discovery that Palacios was in the United States illegally, prompting his Mississippi reentry conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b354-8\">. Specifically addressing Palacios, the district court stated, \"I would like to acknowledge that I have received several letters submitted on your behalf from persons. Most recently the court received a letter from [a homeowner]. Apparently, you have done some work for her. I do appreciate those letters <em>and I have personally reviewed those letters in connection with your sentence.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b354-24\">. After all, a review of the PSR reveals that Palacios was last deported on May 28, 2005, after serving twenty-eight months in federal prison for the Mississippi reentry violation, and illegally reentered a mere 20 days later on June 17, 2005, near Laredo, Texas.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
