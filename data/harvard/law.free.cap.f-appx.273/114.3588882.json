May 18, 2007), <em>affg </em>No. A96 208 707 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City June 20, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-15\">When the BIA upholds the IJ\u2019s denial of relief but affirms only certain portions of the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the IJ\u2019s decision \u201cminus the ... arguments] for denying relief that [were] rejected by the BIA.\u201d <em>Dong Gao v. BIA, </em>482 F.3d 122, 125 (2d Cir.2007). We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see also Dong Gao, </em>482 F.3d at 126.</p>\n<p id=\"b141-16\">We find that substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination because the IJ\u2019s implausibility findings were \u201ctethered to record evidence\u201d \u2014 i.e., Dong\u2019s own actions and testimony \u2014 and \u201cthere is nothing else in the record from which a firm conviction of error could properly be derived.\u201d <em>Wensheng Yan v. Mukasey, </em>509 F.3d 63, 67 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b141-17\">Although Dong\u2019s arrest in the United States was not material to her asylum claim, the agency properly took into ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>count the fact that Dong was not forthcoming in her testimony about the circumstances of that arrest. <em>Cf. Shu Wen Sun v. BIA, </em>510 F.Sd 377, 381 (2d Cir.2007) (noting that this Court gives \u201cparticular deference\u201d to an IJ\u2019s assessment of an applicant\u2019s demeanor, which includes findings that an applicant \u201cwas evasive and non-responsive in a manner that suggested untruthfulness, rather than nervousness or difficulty comprehending the proceedings\u201d (internal quotation marks and citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-4\">Furthermore, the IJ properly noted inconsistencies in the record regarding whether Dong had worked as a prostitute in the United States and whether she discussed this with immigration officials. <em>See Liang Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>454 F.3d 103, 106-107 (2d Cir.2006) (noting that when examining an applicant\u2019s testimony, \u201can IJ need not consider the centrality <em>vel non </em>of each individual discrepancy or omission ... and may conduct an overall evaluation of testimony in light of its rationality or internal consistency and the manner in which it hangs together with other evidence\u201d). Because the IJ\u2019s credibility findings with regard to Dong\u2019s arrest were \u201cbased upon neither a misstatement of the facts in the record nor bald speculation or caprice,\u201d we will not disturb them. <em>Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 74 (2d Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks omitted), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 305 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b142-5\">Additionally, the IJ found unreliable a certificate from the hospital where Dong was allegedly forced to have an abortion. That finding was supported by specific, cogent findings \u2014 i.e., the absence of the precise date of the abortion despite Dong\u2019s assertion that the hospital maintained records reflecting the precise date of the abortion \u2014 and, therefore, is entitled to deference. <em>See Niang v. Mukasey, </em>511 F.3d 138, 146 (2d Cir.2007); <em>see also Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 342 (2d Cir.2006) (noting that the weight afforded to the applicant\u2019s evidence lies largely within the discretion of the IJ). Because the IJ already reasonably believed that Dong was not credible, it was not improper for the IJ to base her adverse credibility determination in part on the fact that Dong failed to submit evidence (other than the hospital certificate) of her month-long hospitalization following the alleged abortion, a statement from her husband or sister, and photos of her husband and son. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen, </em>471 F.3d at 341.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-7\">The foregoing findings demonstrate that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination was supported by substantial evidence. <em>See Zhou Yun Zhang, </em>386 F.3d at 74. Accordingly, the Agency\u2019s denial of Dong\u2019s application for withholding of removal was not improper.</p>\n<p id=\"b142-8\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, Dong\u2019s pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
