Belin appeals the judgment of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (\u201cVeterans Court\u201d), which affirmed the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals decision denying entitlement of service connection for: (1) residuals of wrist injuries, (2) residuals of exposures to herbicides, and (3) \u201cconstant otic development.\u201d <em>Ronald J. Belin v. Gordon H. Mansfield, </em>No. 05-2268, 2007 WL 3101853 (Vet.App. Oct. 22, 2007). Because we lack jurisdiction, we <em>dismiss </em>his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-8\">Our authority to review a decision of the Veterans Court is extremely limited. We may review such a decision only to the extent that it pertains to the validity of \u201ca rule of law or of any statute or regulation ... or any interpretation thereof (other than a determination as to a factual matter),\u201d or \u201cto interpret constitutional and statutory provisions, to the extent presented and necessary to a decision.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7292(a), 7292(c). Unless an appeal from the Veterans Court presents a constitutional issue, we do not otherwise have jurisdiction to review either \u201ca challenge to a factual determination\u201d or \u201ca challenge to a law or regulation as applied to the facts of a particular case.\u201d 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b967-9\">Belin sets forth many reasons why he believes the Veterans Court decision was erroneous. He does not, however, identify any error or issues pertaining to the validity or the interpretation of a rule, statute or regulation. Moreover, after an independent review of the record, we see no constitutional issues upon which jurisdiction could be predicated.</p>\n<p id=\"b967-10\">Since Belin\u2019s appeal challenges only the Veterans Court\u2019s application of established law concerning service connection to the facts and circumstances of his case, we have no jurisdiction to review it.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
