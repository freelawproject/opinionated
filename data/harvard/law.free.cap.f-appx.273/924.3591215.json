Nicholson, </em>04-2397, 2006 WL 4029680 (Dec. 29, 2006). William B. Merritt has not responded.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-17\">This case was stayed pending the court\u2019s disposition in <em>Sanders v. Nicholson, </em>487 F.3d 881 (Fed.Cir.2007) and its companion case <em>Simmons v. Nicholson, </em>487 F.3d 892 (Fed.Cir.2007). In <em>Sanders, </em>this court held that any 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5103(a) error should be presumed prejudicial and the Secretary has the burden of rebutting this presumption. <em>Id. </em>at 891.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-18\">The Secretary concedes that in light of this court\u2019s holding in <em>Sanders, </em>the CAVC erroneously placed the burden on Merritt to demonstrate that the section 5103(a) notice error was prejudicial. Under these circumstances, the court agrees with the Secretary that vacating the CAVC\u2019s judgment and remanding the matter to apply the prejudicial error framework set forth in <em>Sanders </em>is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-19\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b950-20\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b950-21\">(1) The judgment of the CAVC is vacated and the matter is remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-22\">(2) The Secretary\u2019s motion to file his response out-of-time is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-23\">(3) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
