We will deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b217-21\">Zheng arrived in the United States without valid entry documents; he conceded removability but sought asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d) in an initial application for relief. After the Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) warned him about the consequences of filing a frivolous application, Zheng withdrew his request for asylum and withholding of removal and instead sought relief only under the CAT.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Zheng alleged that Chinese officials, upon his repatriation to China, would detain him for leaving without permission and that the conditions of his detention would amount to torture. Zheng also claimed to owe $20,000 to the snakeheads who assisted him in coming to the United States. Zheng testified that if he does not pay his debt, the smugglers\u2014who Zheng claimed are connected to corrupt local government officials\u2014would torture him. The IJ denied Zheng\u2019s application, and the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d) affirmed. Zheng filed a timely petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"A7v\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"192\">*192</page-number>The primary issue Zheng raises on appeal is whether the IJ applied an erroneous legal standard in light of our decision in <em>Silva-Rengifo v. Attorney General of the United States, </em>473 F.3d 58, 70 (3d Cir.2007). CAT requires that torturous conduct be inflicted \u201cby or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.18(a)(1). In <em>Silva-Rengifo, </em>we held: \u201cacquiescence to torture requires only that government officials remain willfully blind to torturous conduct and breach their legal responsibility to prevent it.\u201d <em>Silva-Rengifo, </em>473 F.3d at 70. Zheng argues that, even though snakeheads are not government officials, it is enough that the government is willfully blind to the snakeheads\u2019 torturous conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"AGQ\">We may review Zheng\u2019s claim only if he has exhausted all administrative remedies available to him as of right. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1). Because Zheng did not properly present the willful blindness claim to the BIA, we lack jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s ruling. <em>See Bejar v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 127,132 (3d Cir.2003). The only mention of \u201cwillful blindness\u201d in Zheng\u2019s BIA brief relates to his fear of torture at the hands of Chinese officials, The brief did not reference snakeheads or private parties acting in collusion with government officials. While Zheng\u2019s BIA brief preceded our ruling in <em>Silva-Rengifo </em>the factual basis for the claim was clearly addressed in the IJ\u2019s decision. Furthermore, several other circuits had adopted the \u201cwillful blindness\u201d standard at the time Zheng filed his BIA brief. <em>Silva-Rengifo, </em>473 F.3d at 70. Therefore, Zheng cannot be excused from arguing either the legal or factual basis for the \u201cwillful blindness\u201d standard before the BIA; thus, the claim is waived. <em>See Steevenez v. Gonzales, </em>476 F.3d 114, 117 (2d Cir.2007) (per curiam) (in order to properly exhaust a claim, the issue raised on appeal must be either a specific subsidiary legal argument or an extension of an argument raised directly before the BIA).</p>\n<p id=\"A4N\">Zheng also alludes to the BIA\u2019s decision determining that he did not meet his burden of proof under CAT. To qualify for CAT protection an applicant bears the burden of proving, through objective evidence, that it is more likely than not that he would be tortured in the country to which he will be removed. <em>Lavira v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>478 F.3d 158, 166 (3d Cir.2007). The BIA\u2019s decision that Zheng failed to meet the burden of proof is supported by substantial evidence; therefore, we will affirm_ <em>See Guo v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 556, 561 (3d Cir.2004). Specifically, Zheng failed to present evidence that, because he illegally immigrated from China, he would likely be tortured upon his return. The IJ found, and the BIA agreed, that even if there was evidence that an immigrant returning to China would be detained, there was insufficient evidence presented to show that detainees would likely be subjected to torture. Further, the BIA, citing material inconsistencies in the record and Zheng\u2019s lack of credibility, plausibly found unpersuasive evidence that Zheng\u2019s brother was tortured when he attempted to ieave China,</p>\n<p id=\"ABn\">For the above-stated reasons, we will deny the petition for review,</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b217-14\">. The BIA noted that Zheng's timely recantation of his initial application precluded a finding of a frivolous filing. <em>See Mihanna v. Gonzales, </em>399 F.3d 582, 588-89 (3d Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
