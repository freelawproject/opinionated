Carty </em>and <em>Zavala, </em>520 F.3d 984 (9th Cir.2008). This panel unanimously finds this case suitable for decision without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-2\" label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b672-23\"> The Honorable Leonard B. Sand, United States District Judge for the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b672-19\">\n<em>MEMORANDUM </em>\n<footnotemark>***</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b672-20\">Defendant-Appellant Claudio Ornelas-Banuelos appeals the imposition of a 77 month sentence by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California after pleading guilty to being a deported alien found in the United States. Appellant alleges that the district court imposed an unreasonable sentence (1) by adopting language of the Presentence Investigation Report (\u201cP.S.R.\u201d) without considering the factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and (2) failing to consider defendant\u2019s arguments about over-representation of his criminal history and a perceived sentencing disparity between defendant and others convicted of the same crime. Finding no reversible error and the sentence to be reasonable, we affirm the district court\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b672-21\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b672-22\">No longer mandatory after <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the Federal Sentencing Guidelines now grant district courts discretion to determine sentences according to the provisions of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) after first determining the correct advisory guideline range. <em>United States v. Mix, </em>457 F.3d 906, 911 (9th Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>2006). This Court has jurisdiction to review for reasonableness sentences imposed within the guideline range by the district court. <em>United States v. Plouffe, </em>445 F.3d 1126, 1130 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-5\">Section 3553(a)(2) states that a district court shall impose a sentence</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATV8\">sufficient, but not greater than necessary ... (A) to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (B) to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct; (C) to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; and (D) to provide the defendant with needed ... training, medical care, or other correctional treatment. ...</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b673-6\">The district court should weigh factors such as \u201cthe nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant;\u201d \u201cthe kinds of sentences available;\u201d \u201cthe [applicable] sentencing range[;]\u201d and \u201cthe need to avoid unwai\u2019ranted sentence disparities\u201d among similar defendants. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), (3)-(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-7\">The factors need not be considered individually but some minimal level of consideration of the factors as a whole is needed. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Catty, </em>520 F.3d 984, 992-94 (9th Cir.2008), <em>United States v. Knows His Gun, </em>438 F.3d 913, 918 (9th Cir.2006) (\u201cThis requirement does not necessitate a specific articulation of each factor separately, but rather a showing that the district court considered the statutorily-designated factors in imposing a sentence.\u201d). The sentence must be \u201cnot greater than necessary\u201d to accomplish the sentencing objectives of \u00a7 3553. <em>Booker, </em>543 U.S. at 261, 125 S.Ct. 738, <em>Carty, </em>520 F.3d at 990-91.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-8\">Appellant agrees that the P.S.R. (later adopted by the district court) properly calculated the advisory sentencing guidelines range (77 to 96 months) but argues that the district court should have considered the \u00a7 3553 factors, and that if it had done so it would have sentenced appellant to a lesser term. (Appellant\u2019s Br. at 10.)</p>\n<p id=\"b673-10\">Review of the record leads us to the opinion that the district court did in fact analyze the \u00a7 3553 factors and defendant\u2019s disparity and over-representation arguments. This analysis led the district court to conclude that its 77 month sentence was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b673-11\">At sentencing the district court informed the parties that it had \u201cread and considered\u201d the P.S.R. and both the government\u2019s and defendant\u2019s sentencing memoranda. (E.R. 45:23-46:4.) The P.S.R. contains a comprehensive account of the offense, appellant\u2019s prior criminal history, computation of his criminal history, sentencing options, factors that might warrant departure under the guidelines, and other factors to be considered. (P.S.R. 1-11.) The other factors to be considered included the Supreme Court\u2019s mandate in <em>Booker </em>and a list of the factors to be considered by the district court under \u00a7 3553. (P.S.R. 11.) Neither party objected to the court\u2019s adoption of the P.S.R. (E.R. 47:4-7).</p>\n<p id=\"b673-12\">Defendant\u2019s sentencing memorandum, which the court acknowledged reading, argued for a sentence of 51 months, as appellant does now, and made the same arguments concerning the alleged disparity between defendant and other criminals and the over-representation of defendant\u2019s criminal history. (E.R. 6-11.) The memorandum addressed specific \u00a7 3553 points of consideration, including the nature of the offense, respect for the law, adequate punishment for the offense, protection of the community, and deterrent value. (E.R. 10.)</p>\n<p id=\"b673-13\">The government\u2019s memorandum, which the court acknowledged reading at sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"648\">*648</page-number>tencing, further addressed \u00a7 3553. The government explained that defendant\u2019s pri- or child-sex offense (which resulted in a six-year prison term and defendant\u2019s prior removal from the United States) precluded his eligibility from the \u201cFast-Track\u201d program and his past criminal history was not over-represented. (E.R. 41.) Further, the government explained that a 77 month sentence: would protect the public, would have strong deterrent value, and adequately took into consideration the personal history and characteristics of the defendant. (E.R. 42.)</p>\n<p id=\"b674-4\">Finally, while meting out defendant\u2019s sentence, the district court discussed application of the \u00a7 3553 factors in conjunction with its adoption of the P.S.R., in particular defendant\u2019s age, prior criminal history including the child-sex charges, and respect for the law. (E.R. 49:18-50:9.)</p>\n<p id=\"b674-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b674-6\">With the benefit of the en banc decision of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in <em>Carty </em>we have reexamined the sentencing imposed herein. We conclude that the district court\u2019s reasoning and determination was fully compliant with existing law. <em>See Carty, </em>520 F.3d at 991-93, 995-96.</p>\n<p id=\"b674-7\">The district court\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b672-24\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and may not be cited to or by the courts of this circuit except as provided by 9th Cir.
