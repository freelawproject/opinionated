Gonzales, </em>499 F.3d 329, 334 (4th Cir.2007). We further find that we lack jurisdiction to review Nken\u2019s claim that the Board should have exercised its sua sponte power to reopen his proceedings. <em>See Ali v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 518 (2d Cir.2006) (collecting cases). Accordingly, we deny the petition for review. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-23\">\n<em>PETITION DENIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
