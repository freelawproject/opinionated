Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b695-25\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b695-26\">Arthur Ellerd and Tammy Le appeal the district court\u2019s orders enforcing a settlement agreement between Ellerd, Le and the County of Los Angeles.</p>\n<p id=\"b695-27\">We have jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s final orders enforcing the settlement agreement under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. <em>See Adams v. Johns-Manville Corp., </em>876 F.2d 702, 704 (9th Cir.1989). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"670\">*670</page-number>We review enforcement of a settlement agreement for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Doi v. Halekulani Corp., </em>276 F.3d 1131, 1136 (9th Cir.2002). \u201cReversal is appropriate only if the court based its decision on an error of law or clearly erroneous findings of fact.\u201d <em>Maynard v. City of San Jose, </em>37 F.3d 1396, 1401 (9th Cir.1994) (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-4\">The parties dispute whether federal or state law governs the determination that the parties reached an enforceable settlement. It is unnecessary for us to decide this issue because to the extent that federal and California law differ, the result is the same even under the law most favorable to Ellerd and Le.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-5\">Under both California and federal law, settlement agreements are unenforceable when an essential term is uncertain or undefined. <em>See Transamerica Equip. Leasing Corp. v. Union Bank, </em>426 F.2d 273, 274 (9th Cir.1970); <em>Lindsay v. Lewandowski, </em>139 Cal.App.4th 1618, 43 Cal. Rptr.3d 846, 849 (2006). Here, all of the material terms \u2014 such as the amount of the settlement \u2014 are sufficiently definite. The payout formula is a logistical detail on which there is no genuine disagreement in light of the County\u2019s willingness to abide by any formula proposed by Ellerd and Le not inconsistent with the Terms of Settlement. No evidentiary hearing is required because there is no dispute over material terms. <em>See Callie v. Near, </em>829 F.2d 888, 890 (9th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-6\">Le argues that she is not bound by the Terms of Settlement because she did not personally sign it, only her attorney did. Under California law, the most favorable to Le\u2019s position, the County has the burden to show that Le gave express authority to her lawyer, ratified the settlement, or executed the settlement herself. <em>See Blanton v. Womancare, Inc., </em>38 Cal.3d 396, 212 Cal.Rptr. 151, 696 P.2d 645, 652 (1985); <em>Jones v. Noble, </em>3 Cal.App.2d 316, 39 P.2d 486, 489 (1934). The County came forward with evidence from which an inference can be drawn that Le\u2019s lawyer had the express authority to settle the case on her behalf. In response, Le presented a declaration stating that <em>she </em>did not agree to the settlement. Conspicuously missing is any statement to the effect that her lawyer was not authorized to act on her behalf.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b695-29\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
