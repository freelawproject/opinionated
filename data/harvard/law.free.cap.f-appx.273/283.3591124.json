Parker argues that his sentence is unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to accomplish the goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b310-14\">We review the sentence to determine whether it is reasonable, applying an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). We presume that a sentence imposed within the properly calculated sentencing guidelines range is reasonable. <em>United States v. Go, </em>517 F.3d 216,-(4th Cir.2008); <em>see Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-68, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). A district court must explain the sentence it imposes sufficiently for us to effectively review its reasonableness, but need not mechanically discuss all the factors listed in \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Montes-Pineda, </em>445 F.3d 375, 380 (4th Cir.2006). The court\u2019s explanation should indicate that it considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the arguments raised by the parties. <em>Id. </em>We do not evaluate the adequacy of the district court\u2019s explanation \u201cin a vacuum,\u201d but also consider \u201c[t] he context surrounding a district court\u2019s explanation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 381.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-18\">The district court imposed a sentence of 100 months\u2019 imprisonment, within the advisory guidelines range of 84 to 105 months\u2019 imprisonment. Parker contends that a sentence of 84 months\u2019 imprisonment, at the low end of the guidelines range, would have adequately deterred him from future criminal activity and allowed him to effectively take part in a substance abuse treatment program. Parker argues that the district court overemphasized his criminal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>history and did not adequately consider his cooperation with authorities or his family background.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">Parker has not overcome the presumptive reasonableness of his sentence within the guidelines range, and the district court did not abuse its discretion. Although the district court did not discuss the \u00a7 3558(a) factors individually, it stated that it considered the factors and the arguments raised by the parties in determining Parker\u2019s sentence. The district court expressly considered Parker\u2019s argument that a sentence at the high end of the guidelines range was greater than necessary to have a deterrent effect, and implicitly considered his arguments for leniency based upon his timely acceptance of responsibility and his family background. The court also considered the evidence in the Presentence Investigation Report, which noted that Parker has several prior convictions for drug offenses that occurred while he was on probation, indicating that his previous sentences have not had a deterrent effect. Accordingly, the district court reasonably determined within its discretion that Parker\u2019s criminal history and the nature of the charged offense justified imposing a sentence of 100 months\u2019 imprisonment, slightly below the high end of the guidelines imprisonment range. Accordingly, we affirm the sentence imposed by the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
