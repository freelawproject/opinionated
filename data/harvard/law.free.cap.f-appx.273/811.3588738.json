Darville had pled guilty and been sentenced for a substantive cocaine charge arising out of an offense involving the importation of cocaine in March 2006. The instant conspiracy and attempt charges arose out of a prior offense, committed in January 2006. Citing <em>United States v. Reed, </em>980 F.2d 1568 (11th Cir. 1993), and <em>United States v. Boldin, </em>772 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"812\">*812</page-number>F.2d 719 (llth Cir.1985), Darville argues on appeal that, because the government allegedly was aware of the facts behind the January offense forming the basis of the instant indictment when it charged him for the March offense, it was now barred from prosecuting the instant indictment \u201cbecause of the due diligence requirement established as an outgrowth of double jeopardy litigation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b838-4\">Darville\u2019s claim involves a pure question of law, and thus, is reviewed <em>de novo. Cf. United States v. Duarte-Acero, </em>208 F.3d 1282, 1284 (llth Cir.2000). \u201cThe due diligence exception was created to permit a second prosecution in those cases in which the Double Jeopardy Clause would otherwise bar it.\u201d <em>United States v. Maza, </em>983 F.2d 1004, 1008 (llth Cir.1993). In <em>Boldin, </em>we stated that our holding that the prosecution was not barred by double jeopardy from bringing a 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 848 Continuing Criminal Enterprise (\u201cCCE\u201d) charge \u201cd[id] not preempt the appellants\u2019 other argument that the government subjected] them to multiple prosecutions because, in the exercise of due diligence, it knew or should have known of the appellants\u2019 participation in a continuing series of violations of section 848.\u201d <em>Boldin, </em>772 F.2d at 732. However, in <em>Maza, </em>a case decided later that also involved a \u00a7 848 charge subsequent to a conspiracy conviction, we noted that Boldin\u2019s discussion of a due diligence requirement was dicta. 983 F.2d at 1008 n. 8. In <em>Maza, </em>we held that the district court\u2019s finding that the prosecution was not double-jeopardy barred, but was barred for lack of due diligence in bringing charges, was erroneous. <em>See id. </em>at 1008. Further, we noted that the district court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b838-5\">applied the due diligence concept to preclude a second prosecution which he had already decided was <em>not </em>barred by double jeopardy. This is precisely the reverse order of the correct application of the doctrine. The Double Jeopardy Clause does not preclude bringing in a second action any charge which <em>might </em>have been brought in the first action. Rather, it only precludes those which <em>must </em>have been brought in the first or be forever lost. The due diligence doctrine provides an exception in this latter situation. Thus, it follows, that if the government need not have brought all of its charges in the first action, there was nothing for it to be diligent about.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b838-7\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b838-8\">Because Darville does not argue that the instant charges violate the Due Process Clause, we conclude that the due diligence exception is inapplicable. By conceding that there was no double-jeopardy bar applicable to either indictment, he cannot now argue that there was anything for the government \u201cto be diligent about,\u201d and, thus, the due diligence exception to a double jeopardy bar is inapplicable and his due diligence challenge is baseless. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s order denying Darville\u2019s motion to dismiss the indictment and thus affirm Darville\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b838-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
