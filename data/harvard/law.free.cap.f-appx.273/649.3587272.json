We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1), and deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b676-7\">Because the BIA expressly adopted and affirmed the immigration judge\u2019s (IJ) entire decision, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as if it were that of the BIA. <em>Abebe v. Gonzales, </em>432 F.3d 1037, 1040-41 (9th Cir. 2005) (en banc). The IJ\u2019s determinations that a petitioner is not eligible for asylum, withholding of removal and CAT relief are reviewed under the substantial evidence standard, and reversal is proper only if the evidence compels a contrary result. <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992); <em>Ali v. Ashcroft, </em>394 F.3d 780, 784 (9th Cir.2005). Adverse credibility findings are also reviewed for substantial evidence, though a credibility determination must be supported by \u201cspecific and cogent\u201d reasons, and the inconsistencies in the petitioner\u2019s testimony must <em>\u201cgo </em>to the heart of the asylum claim.\u201d <em>Kaur v. Ashcroft, </em>379 F.3d 876, 884 (9th Cir.2004) (citation and quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-9\">Gbreslassie argues that the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding is unsupported by substantial evidence, and therefore she is entitled to asylum and withholding of removal. We disagree. The immigration judge gave \u201cspecific and cogent\u201d reasons for her adverse credibility finding based on numerous inconsistencies between Gbreslassie\u2019s two written asylum applications and her oral testimony before the asylum officer and the immigration judge. The inconsistencies in Gbreslassie\u2019s testimony were not minor, but rather went \u201cto the heart\u201d of her asylum claim. The conflicts revolved around Gbreslassie\u2019s alleged incarceration (her only incident of persecution), her husband\u2019s alleged incarceration, her membership in political groups, and her reasons for leaving Ethiopia and coming to the United States. <em>See, e.g., Li v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 959, 962 (9th Cir.2004); <em>Valderrama v. INS, </em>260 F.3d 1083, 1085 (9th Cir. 2001); <em>Pal v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 935, 938 (9th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-10\">Because Gbreslassie\u2019s testimony was properly discredited, and because she offered no other evidence in support of her application, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s finding that she was ineligible for asylum and withholding of removal. <em>Alvarez-Santos v. INS, </em>332 F.3d 1245, 1254-55 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b676-11\">Gbreslassie also appeals the IJ\u2019s denial of her CAT claim, and couches this argument in terms of the IJ\u2019s failure to make a \u201cde novo\u201d determination of her CAT claim. This contention fails because the IJ need not make a \u201cde novo\u201d CAT determination when it has found the petitioner not credible in the asylum context. <em>Almaghzar v. Gonzales, </em>457 F.3d 915, 921-23 (9th Cir. 2006), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 1839, 167 L.Ed.2d 323 (2007). To the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>extent that Gbreslassie\u2019s brief can be read as arguing that the IJ\u2019s CAT finding is unsupported by substantial evidence, that claim fails as well. The only evidence supporting Gbreslassie\u2019s CAT claim is her testimony and country conditions reports from Ethiopia. Gbreslassie\u2019s testimony has been discredited, and the country conditions reports do not compel the conclusion that Gbreslassie would be tortured upon her return to Ethiopia. <em>Id. </em>at 928.</p>\n<p id=\"b677-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b676-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
