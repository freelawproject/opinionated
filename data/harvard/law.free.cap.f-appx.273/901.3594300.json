Principi, </em>01-2148 (June 1, 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b928-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"902\">*902</page-number>The Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals denied an increased rating for service-connected cephalagia, currently rated as 30% disabling. The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims vacated the Board\u2019s decision to the extent that it denied a rating in excess of 30% for cephalagia and remanded the case to the Board, and the Secretary appealed.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b928-4\">This case was stayed pending the court\u2019s disposition in <em>Roan v. Principi, </em>2004-7093, which was stayed pending the court\u2019s disposition in <em>Sanders v. Nicholson, </em>487 F.3d 881 (Fed.Cir.2007), and its companion case <em>Simmons v. Nicholson, </em>487 F.3d 892 (Fed. Cir.2007). In <em>Sanders, </em>this court held that any 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5103(a) error should be presumed prejudicial and the Secretary has the burden of rebutting this presumption. <em>Id. </em>at 891.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-5\">The court agrees that summary affirmance of the judgment vacating in part and remanding to the Board is appropriate in light of our decisions in <em>Simmons </em>and <em>Sanders.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b928-6\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b928-7\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b928-8\">(1) The stay of proceedings is lifted.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-9\">(2) The judgment of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims is summarily affirmed. The case is remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b928-10\">(3) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b928-12\"> The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims stated that the Board\u2019s denial of Bobby P. Herring, Jr.'s claim for a temporary total disability rating was not before the court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
