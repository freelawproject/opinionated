The applicable Guidelines range was 33 to 41 months\u2019 imprisonment, but the district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"841\">*841</page-number>court sentenced Valenzuela to the statutory maximum of 60 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">On appeal, Valenzuela argues that the sentence was not reasonable in light of the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors. In addition to his arguments concerning the substantive reasonableness of the sentence, Valenzuela more specifically asserts that, under \u00a7 3553(a)(6), the district court created an unwarranted sentencing disparity between himself and his co-defendant, who received a 33-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-6\">After a careful consideration of the briefs, review of the record on appeal, and having heard oral argument in the matter, we are unable to conclude that the district court misapplied \u00a7 3553(a)(6). Nor are we able to conclude that the sentence Valenzuela received was otherwise unreasonable. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b867-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
