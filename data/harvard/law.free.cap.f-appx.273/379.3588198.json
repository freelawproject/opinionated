Castro appeals his conviction and sentence. He first argues that his sentence, which exceeds the advisory guidelines range, is improper because the district court committed procedural errors at sentencing and because the sentence imposed is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Under the discretionary sentencing system established by <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), district courts retain the duty to properly calculate and consider the Guidelines, along with the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), when fashioning a sentence. <em>United States v. Mares, </em>402 F.3d 511, 518-19 (5th Cir.2005). When reviewing a sentence, we typically consider whether the district court committed procedural error at sentencing and whether the sentence imposed is substantively reasonable. <em>See Gall v. United States</em>, \u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). However, because Castro did not raise these specific claims of error in the district court, review is for plain error only. <em>See United States v. Hernandez-Martinez, </em>485 F.3d 270, 273 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 325, 169 L.Ed.2d 229 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-10\">Castro first contends that the district court erred and improperly calculated the pertinent guidelines range by denying him an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. A review of the entire record shows that the district court\u2019s denial of the sentencing adjustment for acceptance of responsibility was firmly grounded in its credibility determination and is \u201cplausible in light of the record taken as a whole.\u201d <em>See United States v. Spires, </em>79 F.3d 464, 467 (5th Cir.1996); <em>United States v. Alaniz-Alaniz, </em>38 F.3d 788, 790 n. 3 (5th Cir. 1994). Consequently, this decision was not erroneous. <em>See United States v. Solis, </em>299 F.3d 420, 458 (5th Cir.2002); <em>see also Hernandez-Martinez, </em>485 F.3d at 273.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-15\">Castro also argues that the district court\u2019s decision to impose a sentence greater than that recommended by the Guidelines was erroneously based on his prior arrest. Our review of the record shows refutes this argument. The district court\u2019s extensive reasons for judgment show that its choice of sentence was based on Castro\u2019s history and characteristics, the nature and circumstances of his offense, the need to promote respect for the law, and the need to protect the public. These are proper factors for a court to consider when imposing sentence. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Further, there is no indication that the district court\u2019s decision to depart was based on Castro\u2019s \u201cprior arrest record itself.\u201d <em>See United States v. Cantu-Dominguez, </em>898 F.2d 968, 970 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b406-16\">Castro\u2019s contention that the district court failed to properly consider the guidelines is refuted by the record. Castro has shown no error, plain or otherwise, in connection with his sentence. To the contrary, the district court committed no procedural error at sentencing, and the sentence imposed is substantively reasonable. <em>See Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 594.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-17\">Castro\u2019s remaining claims similarly lack merit. Castro\u2019s argument that the district court erred by not providing him with advance notice of its intent to impose a nonguidelines sentence is, as he concedes, foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Mejia-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number><em>Huerta, </em>480 F.3d 713, 722-23 (5th Cir. 2007), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(April 18, 2007) (No. 06-1381). Castro\u2019s constitutional challenge to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g) is likewise foreclosed. <em>See United States v. Daugherty, </em>264 F.3d 513, 518 (5th Cir. 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b407-5\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b406-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
