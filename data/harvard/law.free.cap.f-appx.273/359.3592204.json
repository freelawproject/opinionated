They argue that procedural reasonableness required the district court to consider upward departures to their sentences under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3 for their under-represented criminal histories before it imposed their non-guidelines sentences and that their sentences were substantively unreasonable because the district court failed to apply \u00a7 4A1.3, because it put too much weight on the fact that the defendants had prior DUIs and received light sentences for those DUIs, and because it clearly erred in balancing the sentencing factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">We review sentences for reasonableness in light of the sentencing considerations set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Sanchez-Ramirez, </em>497 F.3d 531, 534 (5th Cir.2007). The Guidelines provide but a \u201crough approximation\u201d of a sentence that will meet all objectives of \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2464-65, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">The defendants\u2019 argument that the district court had to consider \u00a7 4A1.3 before imposing their non-guidelines sentences has previously been rejected by this court. <em>See United States v. Mejia-Huerta, </em>480 F.3d 713, 723 &amp; n. 43 (5th Cir.2007), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(April 18, 2007) (No. 06-1381). The defendants\u2019 argument of substantive unreasonableness is also without merit. The district court gave extensive reasons for imposing their non-guidelines sentences, including such \u00a7 3553(a) factors as the defendants\u2019 personal history and characteristics, the defendants\u2019 criminal histories, the need to promote respect for the law, the need to deter future criminal conduct, and the need to protect the public. <em>See </em>\u00a7 3553(a); <em>United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 709 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-12\">The defendants argue that the district court was required to provide them with notice before imposing an above-guidelines sentence. This argument is foreclosed by circuit precedent. <em>See Mejia-Huerta, </em>480 F.3d at 722-23; <em>Ketchum v. Gulf Oil Corp., </em>798 F.2d 159, 162 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-13\">In light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), the defendants also challenge the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. This argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>United States v. Pineda-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 872, 169 L.Ed.2d 737 (2008). The defendants\u2019 sentences are AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b386-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
