In that order, the BIA declined to reconsider its earlier denial of Basbous\u2019s \u201crequest for reinstatement of his 30 day period of voluntary departure.\u201d While the BIA misinterpreted Basbous\u2019s request as seeking an extension rather than a toll of his voluntary departure period, Basbous\u2019s voluntary departure period had nonetheless elapsed prior to the filing of his motion to reconsider. Accordingly, the BIA properly denied the motion, and we will deny Basbous\u2019s petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-22\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-23\">As we write mainly for the parties, we only briefly recite the facts. On August 5, 2004, an Immigration Judge (IJ) rejected Basbous\u2019s claims for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT), but granted Basbous until September 7, 2004 to depart the country voluntarily. Basbous then filed a timely appeal to the BIA, which affirmed the IJ\u2019s order on December 7, 2005, but permitted Basbous an additional 30 days to depart voluntarily. On January 6, 2006, the last day of his voluntary departure period, Basbous filed a timely motion to reopen. The motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>sought asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the CAT. In the alternative, the motion asked that the BIA \u201creinstate its 80-day grant of voluntary departure in accordance with <em>Kanivets v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 330 (3d Cir.2005)....\u201d Appendix (App.) 38. The BIA subsequently denied the motion, finding in particular \u201cthat such reinstatement would not be in accordance with 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.26(f) (providing the circumstances in which the Board or an immigration judge may extend or reinstate period of voluntary departure).\u201d App. 38. Basbous next filed a motion to reconsider with the BIA on March 31, 2006, requesting only reconsideration of the BIA\u2019s decision to deny his \u201crequest for reinstatement of his 30 day period of voluntary departure.\u201d App. 12. On June 22, 2006, the BIA denied the motion, finding that unlike Kanivets, Basbous \u201csought more than mere tolling of his 30-day period of voluntary departure ... [but instead sought] to begin a new 30-day voluntary departure period.\u201d App. 3. Basbous seeks review of this decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">We review denials of motions to reopen and to reconsider under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>See Borges v. Gonzales, </em>402 F.3d 398, 404 (3d Cir.2005) <em>(citing Shardar v. Ashcroft, </em>382 F.3d 318, 324 (3d Cir.2004)). Accordingly, we will disturb the BIA\u2019s denial of such motions only if the denial is arbitrary, irrational, or contrary to law. <em>Guo v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 556, 562 (3d Cir.2004). Moreover, as Basbous did not seek judicial review of the denial of his motion to reopen within the 30 day period provided by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1), only the June 22, 2006 denial of Basbous\u2019s motion to reconsider is before us.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">In his motion to reconsider, Basbous sought permission to leave the country during what he claimed was his one remaining day for voluntary departure. Basbous correctly asserts that one day remained on his voluntary departure period when he filed his motion to reopen. He also correctly asserts that pursuant to <em>Kanivets, </em>a voluntary departure period is tolled while the BIA deliberates on that motion. However, even under Basbous\u2019s theory of the case \u2014 with his voluntary departure period tolled during the pendency of his motion to reopen \u2014 that period began to run again when the BIA denied his motion to reopen on March 2, 2006. As such, even with the benefit of tolling, Basbous\u2019s voluntary departure period ended the following day, March 3, 2006. Basbous failed to depart the country before that time, and so, the one day Basbous claims remained was indeed \u201ca day long past.\u201d Resp\u2019t Br. at 12. Accordingly, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to reconsider, and we will deny the petition for review.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
