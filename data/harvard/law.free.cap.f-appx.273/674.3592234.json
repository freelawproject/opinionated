Reddy also appeals the IJ\u2019s denial of voluntary departure, and seeks a motion to reopen or remand based on his recent marriage to a U.S. citizen.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-21\">1. Based on the material inconsistencies between Reddy\u2019s asylum application and his testimony, his failure to produce corroborating evidence, his non-responsiveness, and his testimony concerning events not included in his asylum application, there was substantial evidence supporting the adverse credibility determination. <em>See Chebchoub v. I.N.S., </em>257 F.3d 1038, 1045 (9th Cir.2001) (\u201cThe Board had reason to question [Reddy\u2019s] credibility, it supplied specific reasons that related to the basis for his claim, and he failed to produce non-duplicative, material, easily available corroborating evidence and gave no explanation for such failure.\u201d) (citations omitted); <em>see also Alvarez-Santos v. I.N.S., </em>332 F.3d 1245, 1254 (9th Cir.2003) (concluding that adverse credibility determination was supported by substantial evidence because of a \u201cmajor inconsistency.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-22\">2. Reddy\u2019s due process claim based on the IJ\u2019s alleged bias fails because \u201cthe factual record adequately supports the denial of [his] application for relief ...\u201d <em>Rivera v. Mukasey, </em>508 F.3d 1271, 1276 (9th Cir.2007) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-23\">3. Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)\u00ae and 1229c(f), we lack jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s denial of voluntary departure. <em>See Tovar-Landin v. Ashcroft, </em>361 F.3d 1164, 1166 (9th Cir. 2004); <em>see also Mansour v. Ashcroft, </em>390 F.3d 667, 673 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-24\">4. We lack jurisdiction over Reddy\u2019s unexhausted adjustment of status claim. <em>See Rojas-Garcia v. Ashcroft, </em>339 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>814, 819 (9th Cir.2003) (\u201cBefore a petitioner can raise an argument on appeal, the petitioner must first raise the issue before the BIA or IJ.\u201d) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">Petition DENIED in part and DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b700-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
