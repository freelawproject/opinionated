Ferris, denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Yong Zhuang Pan, </em>No. A77 998 445 (B.I.A. June 4, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A77 998 445 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Apr. 11, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-10\">When the BIA affirms the IJ\u2019s decision in all respects but one, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as modified by the BIA decision, that is, \u201cminus the single argument for denying relief that was rejected by the BIA.\u201d <em>Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 522 (2d Cir.2005). We review <em>de novo </em>questions of law and file application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>Dong Gao v. BIA, </em>482 F.3d 122,126 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-13\">As a preliminary matter, because Pan failed to sufficiently challenge the agency\u2019s denial of his CAT claim before this Court, we deem any such argument waived. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b143-14\">Furthermore, because Pan fails to sufficiently argue before this Court that the agency erred in determining that he was not credible, we deem any such argument waived. <em>See id.</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Insofar as the basis of Pan\u2019s alleged fear of future persecution was not \u201cindependent of the testimony that the IJ found not to be credible,\u201d the adverse credibility determination was dispositive of his entire asylum claim. <em>Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 154 (2d Cir.2006). Similarly, because the only evidence of a threat to Pan\u2019s life or freedom depended upon his credibility, the adverse credibility determination in this case necessarily precludes success on his claim for withholding of removal. <em>Id. </em>at 155-56.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-15\">Lastly, we find no error in the BIA\u2019s dismissal of Pan\u2019s argument that the IJ\u2019s conduct violated his right to due process of law where the record reflects that he had ample opportunity to present his claims. <em>See Li Hua Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>453 F.3d 99, 104-05 (2d Cir.2006) (citing <em>Capric v. Ashcroft, </em>355 F.3d 1075, 1087 (7th Cir.2004) (\u201cDue process requires that an applicant receive a full and fair hearing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>which provides a meaningful opportunity to be heard.\u201d)).</p>\n<p id=\"b144-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b143-11\">. In any event, we find that the adverse credibility determination was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
