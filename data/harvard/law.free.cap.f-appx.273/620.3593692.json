He argues that he is not an alien but a United States citizen.</p>\n<p id=\"ANGv\">The BIA is required to ascertain whether new evidence, when considered together with the evidence presented at the original hearing, would establish prima facie eligibility for the relief sought. <em>See Bhasin v. Gonzales, </em>423 F.3d 977, 984 (9th Cir.2005). Here, the BIA held that the facts presented were insufficient to carry Marinero-Turcios\u2019s burden of proof that he was a United States citizen. We are satisfied the BIA applied the correct legal standard; there simply is no evidence in the record that he was under eighteen years of age when his father became naturalized. <em>See </em>Immigration and Nationality Act, \u00a7 321(a), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1432 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"AXrV\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"AXt\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
