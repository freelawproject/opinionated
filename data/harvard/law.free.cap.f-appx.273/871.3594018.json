Coates and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs each respond to the court\u2019s December 3, 2007 order and request that the court summarily affirm the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims in <em>Coates v. Nicholson, </em>03-1181, 2005 WL 1266815 (Mar. 18, 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b897-24\">The Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals denied entitlement to a rating in excess of 30% for post-traumatic stress disorder. The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims vacated the Board\u2019s decision and remanded the case to the Board, and the Secretary appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-25\">This case was stayed pending the court\u2019s disposition in <em>Roan v. Principi, </em>2004-7093, which was stayed pending the court\u2019s disposition in <em>Sanders v. Nicholson, </em>487 F.3d 881 (Fed.Cir.2007), and its companion case <em>Simmons v. Nicholson, </em>487 F.3d 892 (Fed. Cir.2007). In <em>Sanders, </em>this court held that any 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5103(a) error should be presumed prejudicial and the Secretary has the burden of rebutting this presumption. <em>Id. </em>at 891.</p>\n<p id=\"b897-26\">The court agrees that summary affirmance of the judgment vacating and remanding to the Board is appropriate in light of our decisions in <em>Simmons </em>and <em>Sanders.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b897-27\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b897-28\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b897-29\">(1) The stay of proceedings is lifted.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"872\">*872</page-number>(2) The judgment of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims is summarily affirmed. The case is remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b898-4\">(3) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
