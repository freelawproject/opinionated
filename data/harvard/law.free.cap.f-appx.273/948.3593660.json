(\u201cKSEA\u201d) (collectively \u201cappellees\u201d). Because the district court made no error in construing the claims and in granting summary judgment, we <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b975-21\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b975-22\">In September 2002, Luma sued appellees for infringement of the '801 patent. The '801 patent is entitled \u201cManaging Information in an Endoscopy System,\u201d and describes and claims a system for acquiring images during a medical procedure. Two sets of claims from the '801 patent are at issue. The first set, claims 14, 15, 17,19, 29, 30, 32, and 34, are referred to as the Preference Database claims. Only claims 14 and 29 are independent. Claim 14 is representative of the Preference Database claims:</p>\n<p id=\"b975-23\">A system for acquiring images during a medical procedure and using the acquired images, comprising <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"950\">*950</page-number>at least one input device for obtaining said images,</p>\n<p id=\"b976-4\">at least one output device for using the images obtained by said input device to enable image data to be communicated to a medical practitioner,</p>\n<p id=\"AyqS\">a preference database for pre-storing, for each one a plurality of users of said system, respective preference information that indicates one or more visual representations that said one of said plurality of users of said system prefers to be applied to said at least one output device together with said images obtained by said input device, <em>said one or more visual representations comprising graphical objects, </em>and</p>\n<p id=\"b976-5\">a processor for receiving an indication of an identity of one of said users, who is currently using said system, and, responsive to said indication of said identity of said one of said users who is currently using said system, for retrieving said preference information for said one of said users pre-stored in said preference database, for combining said one or more visual representations with said images obtained by said input device based on the preference information in said preference database that corresponds to said one of said users, and for applying said images to said at least one output device together with said one or more visual representations.</p>\n<p id=\"b976-6\">'801 patent col.48 11.12-37 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b976-7\">The second set, claims 44 and 45, are referred to as the Still Frame Buffer claims. Only claim 44 is independent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b976-8\">A system for acquiring images during a medical procedure and using the acquired images, comprising</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AV8\">at least one input device for obtaining said images,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b976-9\">at least one output device for using the images obtained by said input device to enable image data to be communicated to a medical practitioner,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Am2\">\n<em>a still frame buffer configured to temporarily store an image obtained by said at least one input device,</em>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8il\">a memory configured to store images obtained by said at least one input device on a long-term basis, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AoH\">a processor configured to receive a freeze command and in response thereto to freeze in said still frame buffer an image obtained by said at least one input device, and to receive a save command and in response thereto to save in said memory a frozen image.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b976-11\">'801 patent col.50 11.26-40 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b976-12\">The district court referred the claim construction issues to a special master. On February 3, 2006, 2006 WL 285973, the court adopted the special master\u2019s report construing the disputed terms with the exception of modifying the definition of \u201cgraphical objects\u201d for greater clarity. The court construed the claim limitation \u201cgraphical objects\u201d as follows: \u201ca graphical object is a symbol and pertains to pictorial representations of data. Graphical objects are not text. Text is not a graphical object. A graphical object may include text. Text alone is not a graphical object.\u201d The special master\u2019s construction of \u201cstill frame buffer,\u201d adopted by the court, was \u201ca storage for digital image data for a given period of time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b976-13\">On February 21, 2006, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. The district court decided the motions in a July 24, 2006 order, 2006 WL 2076780. The court held that Luma had failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact regarding the presence of a database of preferences relating to graphical objects in the accused Stryker and KSEA products. The court thus granted summary judgment of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"951\">*951</page-number>noninfringement on the Preference Database claims in favor of appellees. The court also found that all of the limitations of claim 44 were anticipated by the prior art Advanced Technology Laboratories Ultramark 5 device and U.S. Patent 4,922,909 (the \u201cLittle patent\u201d). In an August 15, 2006 order, the court clarified that the additional limitations of claim 45 were also disclosed in each of the prior art systems. The court thus granted summary judgment of invalidity of the Still Frame Buffer claims in favor of appellees.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-5\">On August 29, 2006, KSEA filed a motion for attorney fees that the district court denied on March 9, 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-6\">Luma timely appealed, and KSEA timely cross-appealed the denial of its motion for attorney fees. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b977-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b977-8\">\n<em>I. Preference Database Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b977-9\">Luma argues that the district court erred in construing the \u201cgraphical objects\u201d claim limitation to exclude text. Luma argues that nothing in the specification excludes text from the ambit of graphical objects, particularly in light of the fact that, as noted in the specification, modern computer operating systems treat text as pictures of letters <em>(e.g., </em>anti-aliased text). Luma also asserts that even if the district court\u2019s construction were correct, it has presented sufficient evidence to create a triable issue of fact as to whether the appellees\u2019 accused products infringe under the narrower construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-10\">Appellees respond that the district court correctly construed the limitation in light of its use in the specification and the prosecution history of the patent. Appellees argue that both the specification and the prosecution history treat text and \u201cgraphical objects\u201d as two distinct forms of more general \u201cvisual representations.\u201d Appellees add that Luma has failed to point out any evidence that would create a genuine issue of material fact as to infringement under the district court\u2019s construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b977-12\">We review claim construction <em>de novo </em>on appeal. <em>Cybor Corp. v. FAS Tech., Inc., </em>138 F.3d 1448, 1456 (Fed.Cir.1998) (en banc). \u201cWe review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment of noninfringement without deference and draw all reasonable factual inferences in favor of the nonmovant.\u201d <em>Elbex Video, Ltd. v. Sensormatic Elec. Corp., </em>508 F.3d 1366, 1370 (Fed.Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b977-13\">We conclude that the district court correctly construed the limitation \u201cgraphical objects\u201d to exclude text alone. We begin by considering the language of the claims because \u201cthe claims themselves provide substantial guidance as to the meaning of particular claim terms.\u201d <em>Phillips v. AWH Corp., </em>415 F.3d 1303, 1314 (Fed.Cir. 2005) (en banc) (citations omitted). The language of claim 14 indicates that \u201cgraphical objects\u201d are a subset of the more general category of \u201cvisual representations,\u201d but provides no insight as to the inclusion or exclusion of text as part of \u201cgraphical objects.\u201d Dependent claim 15 indicates that \u201ctext\u201d is a subset of the category \u201cvisual representations\u201d as well but does not indicate the relationship between \u201ctext\u201d and \u201cgraphical objects.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b977-14\">We turn next to the specification in order to determine if it provides a clearer indication of the scope of \u201cgraphical objects.\u201d \u201c[Cjlaims must be read in view of the specification, of which they are a part.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1315 (quotations and citation omitted). We find the specification to be indeterminate as to whether one of ordinary skill in the art would understand \u201cgraphical objects\u201d to include text alone. Several passages from the specification indicate by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"952\">*952</page-number>their grammatical structure that \u201cgraphical objects\u201d and \u201ctext\u201d are different things. For example, the inventor stated, \u201cThe one or more visual representations may include text that is anti-aliased for improved appearance, graphical objects, or an additional image or images that may be obtained from an additional input device.\u201d '801 patent col.2 11.33-36; <em>see also </em>col.17 11.45-48 (\u201c[prompting is performed via a graphical object or a text clue imposed on the displayed image\u201d); <em>id. </em>at col.19 11.56-59 (\u201cthe operator ... selects the text or graphical objects with which to annotate the image\u201d). The use of the disjunctive \u201cor\u201d suggests that \u201cgraphical objects\u201d and \u201ctext\u201d are alternatives rather than overlapping categories.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-4\">However, other parts of the specification blur the line between \u201cgraphical objects\u201d and \u201ctext.\u201d For example, after stating that an \u201cinput device\u201d is used \u201cto locate the text or graphical object\u201d on an image, the patent adds that \u201c[ojbject attributes such as font, color, and size can be selected manually or may be supplied by [the] preference database.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at col.19 11.59-63. The antecedent of the word \u201cobject\u201d would seem to be \u201cgraphical object\u201d and yet the specification refers to the \u201cfont\u201d of the object \u2014 an attribute commonly associated with text. Similarly, the specification explains that \u201c[a]nti-aliased text is used extensively throughout the interactions with the system. The anti-aliased text uses broadcast standard anti-aliasing technology in which text and background colors are manipulated on a pixel by pixel basis to give the illusion of smooth transition and well-defined text borders....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at col.19 11.12-17; <em>see also </em>col.19 11.30-34 (explaining that \u201craster anti-aliased text\u201d uses \u201ca color map picture for each letter\u201d). On balance, however, the specification supports the district court\u2019s claim construction.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-5\">Turning to the prosecution history, we find information that is more conclusive that would influence one of ordinary skill in the art\u2019s understanding of \u201cgraphical objects.\u201d \u201c[A] court should also consider the patent\u2019s prosecution history, if it is in evidence.... Like the specification, the prosecution history provides evidence of how the PTO and the inventor understood the patent.\u201d <em>Phillips, </em>415 F.3d at 1318. The originally filed version of claim 14 (designated claim 21) did not include the language \u201csaid one or more visual representations comprising graphical objects\u201d at the end of the \u201cpreference database\u201d clause. Also, a dependent claim (designated claim 22) added the limitation \u201cwherein said one or more visual representations comprise text.\u201d The examiner rejected each of those claims (21 and 22) as anticipated under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 102(b). However, the examiner stated that a second claim dependent from claim 21 (designated claim 24) recited allowable subject matter if rewritten in independent form. Claim 24 added the limitation \u201cwherein said one or more visual representations comprise graphical objects.\u201d The patentee did not traverse the rejection and rewrote claim 24 as suggested by the examiner, which then became claim 14 of the '801 patent. Given that claim 22 that was limited to text was rejected as anticipated while claim 24 that was limited to graphical objects was not, the examiner clearly understood graphical objects not to include text alone. The patentee acquiesced in that understanding by amending his claims in the manner suggested. Thus, we conclude that the district court correctly construed the limitation \u201cgraphical objects\u201d to exclude text alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-6\">Luma further contends that summary judgment of noninfringement was nonetheless improper because it had submitted sufficient evidence to create a genu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>ine issue of fact as to infringement even under the district court\u2019s construction excluding text. Even construing the facts in the manner most favorable to Luma, we agree with the district court that Luma has failed to indicate any genuine issues of material fact with respect to the \u201cpreference database\u201d of \u201cvisual representations comprising graphical objects.\u201d The problem with the very vague marketing materials cited by Luma as support for its argument is that they only reference one out of many linked limitations necessary to meet the claim limitations. Customization alone is insufficient. Likewise, status icons alone that may or may not be customizable (ie., capable of pre-stored preferences associated with a user or type of procedure) are insufficient to meet Luma\u2019s burden. The claims require that pre-stored preferences for the addition of graphical objects to an input image for output to an output device be applied according to information retrieved from a pre-stored database and associated with a particular user or procedure type. Even considered together, the materials referenced by Luma do not indicate this combination of elements in the accused devices.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-5\">\n<em>II. Still Frame Buffer Claims</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b979-6\">Luma argues that the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment of invalidity was based upon an incorrect construction of the claim 44 limitation \u201ctemporarily store\u201d as it relates to the \u201cstill frame buffer.\u201d Luma argues that to \u201ctemporarily store\u201d an image requires more than pausing a single frame of the live video feed from a camera. Instead, Luma argues, it must be possible for the \u201cstill frame buffer\u201d to recall the frozen image (rather than retrieve it from \u201clong-term\u201d memory) even after returning to a continuous display of the video feed from the input. Luma argues that this understanding is necessary to give useful meaning to the words \u201ctemporarily store.\u201d Luma also argues that several statements in the specification support that interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-8\">Appellees respond that Luma has resorted to reading a nonexistent limitation into the claims in order to distinguish the prior art. They argue that there is no language in the claims setting a time limit for storage of the frozen image in the \u201cstill frame buffer\u201d and that there is absolutely no support in the specification for a requirement that an image be retrievable from the \u201cstill frame buffer\u201d after a return to a display of the continuous input.</p>\n<p id=\"b979-9\">We agree with the district court and appellees that Luma\u2019s proposed interpretation lacks support in both the claims and the specification. \u201cAnticipation is a question of fact, but, in reviewing a grant of summary judgment of invalidity for anticipation, we determine <em>de novo </em>whether the evidence creates genuine issues of material fact that should have precluded summary judgment.\u201d <em>Ormco Corp. v. Align Tech., Inc., </em>498 F.3d 1307, 1319 (Fed.Cir.2007) (citations omitted). Here, Luma has not challenged the undisputed facts relied upon by the district court, but only the court\u2019s construction of the limitation \u201cstill frame buffer.\u201d As noted previously, we review issues of claim construction <em>de novo.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b979-10\">The claims include no reference to a temporal limitation on the storage of an image. Nor do the claims make any reference to recall of a previously temporarily stored image. Furthermore, the portions of the specification cited by Luma are in-apposite. Nothing in the specification describes or suggests preserving the image in the still frame buffer once the output returns to display of the live images. In particular, Luma points to the description of the review function in columns 16-17 of the '801 patent. However, nothing in that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"954\">*954</page-number>passage describes a form of intermediate storage. In fact, the specification states that the \u201creview function operates quickly, thereby allowing [the] surgeon to see what\u2019s already in memory.\u201d Claim 44 describes \u201cmemory\u201d as the location of \u201clong-term\u201d storage, not \u201ctemporary\u201d storage. In addition, Figure 6 of the patent has a box labeled \u201cReview\u201d with an arrow pointing to another box that reads \u201c[a]ssemble and display all images as a result of <em>save </em>command.\u201d '801 patent Fig. 6 (emphasis added). Whatever the inventor\u2019s intention may have been with respect to the \u201cstill frame buffer,\u201d the position articulated by Luma is not supported by the specification and not consistent with what was actually claimed.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-4\">Because we affirm the district court\u2019s construction of the \u201cstill frame buffer,\u201d we conclude that the court\u2019s grant of summary judgment of invalidity of claims 44 and 45 for anticipation was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-5\">\n<em>III. KSEA\u2019s Cross-appeal for Attorney Fees</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b980-6\">\u201cThe determination of whether a case is exceptional and, thus, eligible for and warranting an award of attorney fees under \u00a7 285 is a two-step process in which the district court must (1) determine whether there is clear and convincing evidence that a case is exceptional, a factual determination reviewed for clear error, and (2) if so, then determine in its discretion whether an award of attorney fees is justified, a determination that we review for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Digeo, Inc. v. Audible, Inc., </em>505 F.3d 1362, 1366 (Fed. Cir.2007) <em>(citing Cybor, </em>138 F.3d at 1460). KSEA\u2019s arguments amount to a disagreement with the district court about the objective reasonableness of Luma\u2019s litigation positions and the vexatiousness of its litigation conduct. Such differences of opinion without sufficient underlying evidence fall far short of demonstrating either clear error in a finding requiring clear and convincing evidence in the first instance or an abuse of discretion in the second instance. We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s denial of KSEA\u2019s motion for attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b980-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b980-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s entry of summary judgment of noninfringement for the Preference Database claims and of invalidity for the Still Frame Buffer claims. We also affirm the district court\u2019s denial of KSEA\u2019s motion for attorney fees.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
