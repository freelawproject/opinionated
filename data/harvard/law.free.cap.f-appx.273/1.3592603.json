As to his conviction, he argues that the evidence was insufficient to convict him of two counts in the indictment. As to his sentence, he disputes the court\u2019s finding that the drug involved was crack cocaine as opposed to some other form of cocaine base, and he argues that the sentence was longer than necessary to serve the purposes of sentencing and was inadequately explained. For the reasons discussed below, we affirm the conviction and sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-10\">Defendant was initially indicted on a single count of distributing at least five grams of crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), and aiding and abetting others in doing so, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. That indictment arose from a \u201ccontrolled buy\u201d by an undercover agent on February 23, 2005, and was sealed pending defendant\u2019s arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-14\">On April 6, 2005, in the course of defendant\u2019s arrest on that initial indictment, another incident occurred, which ultimately gave rise to a superseding indictment, adding three additional counts: possession with intent to distribute at least five grams of crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1); possession of a firearm \u201cin furtherance of\u2019 that drug trafficking offense, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1); and possession of a firearm after being convicted of another felony, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1). A second superseding indictment later eliminated all references to \u201ccrack cocaine\u201d from the drug counts, charging only that the drug involved was \u201ccocaine base.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b28-15\">After a four-day jury trial, defendant was convicted on all four counts. He was subsequently sentenced to 30 years\u2019 imprisonment, five years below the applicable guideline sentencing range. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and so will not rehearse them here, except in the context of discussing the legal issues raised on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b28-16\">Defendant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence supporting the jury\u2019s verdict on three points.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> With respect to the charge of possession of cocaine base with intent to distribute, arising from the incident of April 6, 2005, he argues that there was insufficient evidence that he knew that the drugs were in the car or that he intended to distribute them. With respect to the charge of possession of a firearm \u201cin furtherance of\u2019 that drug charge, he argues that there was insufficient evidence that the firearms were possessed \u201cto advance or promote\u201d the drug offense. <em>United States v. Grace, </em>367 F.3d 29, 35 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>\u201cThe familiar standard that applies to sufficiency-of-the-evidenee challenges requires that a court \u2018determine whether, after assaying all the evidence in the light most amiable to the government, and taking all reasonable inferences in its favor, a rational factfinder could find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the prosecution successfully proved the essential elements of the crime.\u2019\u201d <em>United States v. Dwinells, </em>508 F.3d 63, 72 (1st Cir.2007) (quoting <em>United States v. O\u2019Brien, </em>14 F.3d 703, 706 (1st Cir.1994)). \u201cWhen the record is fairly susceptible of two competing scenarios, the choice between those scenarios ordinarily is for the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 74. Accordingly, if \u201cthe evidence, taken in its entirety, supports the judgment of conviction ..., \u2018[the government] need not rule out other hypotheses more congenial to a finding of innocence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>United States v. Gifford, </em>17 F.3d 462, 467 (1st Cir.1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b29-5\">Under those standards, defendant\u2019s sufficiency challenge fails on all three points. The jury could have reasonably inferred that defendant knew that the drugs were in the car from the uncontroverted evidence that he was previously involved in drug dealing, <em>United States v. Spinosa, </em>982 F.2d 620, 628-29 (1st Cir.1992), including the incident of February 23, 2005; that he was the driver and sole occupant of the car in which the drugs were found, <em>United States v. Sanchez, </em>943 F.2d 110, 115 (1st Cir.1991); that the drugs were found right in front of the driver\u2019s seat, <em>United States v. Zavala Maldonado, </em>23 F.3d 4, 8 (1st Cir.1994); and that when the police confronted him and directed him to pull over, he attempted to flee, first by car and then on foot, and then violently struggled to avoid arrest, showing his awareness of guilt, <em>United States v. Isler, </em>429 F.3d 19, 25 (1st Cir.2005). <em>See generally United States v. Robinson, </em>473 F.3d 387, 399 (1st Cir.2007) (holding that knowing possession may be inferred from circumstantial evidence). The jury could well have found that evidence to outweigh the evidence pointing the other way \u2014 primarily that the car was registered to someone else \u2014 particularly since defendant was known to frequent the address to which the car was registered.</p>\n<p id=\"b29-8\">The jury could also have reasonably inferred that the drugs found in the car\u2014 44.3 grams of cocaine base, packaged in the form of twelve \u201ceight balls\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> \u2014 were intended for distribution rather than personal use. There was expert testimony that such a large amount, packaged in that manner, would ordinarily be possessed by a dealer rather than an end-user. <em>United States v. Garcia-Carrasquillo, </em>483 F.3d 124, 130 n. 12 (1st Cir.2007). That inference is further supported by the presence in the car of guns, <em>United States v. Andrade, </em>94 F.3d 9, 13 (1st Cir.1996), which, the expert testimony showed, are often used by drug dealers to avoid interference with drug transactions, and by the absence of any implements with which to smoke the crack, <em>id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b29-9\">Finally, there was ample evidence from which the jury reasonably could have inferred that defendant possessed one or two guns \u201cin furtherance\u201d of the April 6th drug offense. Although \u201cmere presence\u201d of the guns at the scene of the drug offense is not sufficient, <em>United States v. Delgado-Hernandez, </em>420 F.3d 16, 25 (1st Cir.2005), there was more here, albeit circumstantial. In particular, the evidence showed that both guns were loaded and located in close proximity to the defendant and to the drugs and therefore could easily have been used to resist any effort, by the police or others, to interfere with the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>tended drug distribution. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Robinson, </em>473 F.3d at 399-400 (finding such evidence sufficient to show that a gun was possessed \u201cin furtherance of\u2019 another crime); <em>United States v. Felton, </em>417 F.3d 97, 105, 106 (1st Cir.2005) (same). In addition, as the prosecution argued at trial, the jury could have inferred that the guns were possessed in connection with the April 6th drug offense from the evidence that defendant also possessed a gun during the February 23rd drug transaction and from the expert testimony that drug dealers commonly have guns to protect the drugs they intend to distribute.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-4\">Defendant\u2019s sentencing challenges fail as well. Although, on appeal, he faults the district court\u2019s finding that the substance involved in the drug offenses was crack, as opposed to some other form of cocaine base, no such argument was made at sentencing. Accordingly, that finding is reviewable only for plain error. No error, plain or otherwise, occurred. In making its findings, the district court permissibly relied on the presentence report, to which defendant posed no relevant objection. <em>United States v. Jimenez, </em>512 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.2007). And that report\u2019s repeated statements that the substance was crack were, in turn, amply supported by competent testimony at trial that the substance was off-white and chunky and therefore appeared to be crack. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Brown, </em>450 F.3d 76, 80-81 (1st Cir.2006). Moreover, any error was not sufficiently prejudicial to satisfy the plain error standard, since defendant\u2019s guideline range resulted not from the nature of the substance involved but from his status as a career offender, which defendant did not challenge below or on appeal. <em>Jimenez, </em>512 F.3d at 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-5\">Nor was the ultimate sentence procedurally or substantively unreasonable under the standards articulated by this court in <em>United States v. Jim\u00e9nez-Beltre, </em>440 F.3d 514 (1st Cir.2006)(en banc), and, more recently, by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007), and <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The district court expressly addressed \u2014 and adopted, in part \u2014 defendant\u2019s argument that a bottom-of-guidelines sentence of 35 years was longer than necessary to serve the purposes of sentencing set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). It was for that reason that the court imposed a sentence five years below the guideline range. The court explained its decision not to vary further as based, \u201cfirst and foremost,\u201d on its belief that a very long sentence was necessary to protect the public, given defendant\u2019s violent criminal record, which included a conviction for conspiracy to commit murder, in which defendant participated in beating the victim to death. Although the court indicated that its decision was also influenced by the guideline range, particularly the career-offender guideline, consideration of that range remains not only permissible but required. <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 596; <em>Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2467; <em>Jim\u00e9nez-Beltre, </em>440 F.3d at 518. Since its ultimate sentence was below the guideline range, the court obviously did not deem the guidelines in general or the career offender guideline in particular to be mandatory. To the extent that defendant quibbles with the weight afforded to the guidelines as opposed to other factors, such balancing, absent abuse of its discretion, is for the district court. <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597-98; <em>United States v. Dixon, </em>449 F.3d 194, 205 (1st Cir.2006). Seeing no such abuse under the circumstances presented here, we affirm the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b30-11\"><em>Affirmed. See </em>1st Cir.
