Bazuaye (\u201cBazuaye\u201d), a citizen of Nigeria, seeks review of a February 12, 2007 decision by the BIA affirming a May 1, 2006 order by Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) Alan L. Page (1) ordering Bazuaye removed on the ground that he had committed an aggravated felony, and denying Bazuaye\u2019s request for relief under section 212(h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(h). <em>In re Bazuaye, </em>No. A24 359 599 (B.I.A. Feb. 12, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A24 459 599 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City. May 1, 2006). We assume the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">When the BIA adopts the IJ\u2019s decision and supplements it, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as supplemented by the BIA. <em>Niang v. Mukasey, </em>511 F.3d 138, 145 (2d Cir.2007). Although we generally accord substantial deference to the BIA\u2019s reasonable interpretation of the INA, a statute that the BIA administers, no such deference is warranted where, as in this case, the challenged BIA decision interprets state law. <em>See Wala v. Mukasey, </em>511 F.3d 102, 105 (2d Cir.2007). We review such decisions <em>de novo. Id. </em>Further, \u201c[i]n deciding whether a crime of conviction fits within the definitions of aggravated felony outlined in \u00a7 1101(a)(43), this Court has adopted a categorical approach, focusing on the elements of the offense of conviction without regard to the factual circumstances of the crime.\u201d <em>Kamagate v. Ashcroft, </em>385 F.3d 144, 152 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-5\">Here, the BIA found Bazuaye removable for having committed an aggravated felony known as an attempted \u201ctheft offense\u201d within the meaning of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G) and (U). In his petition for review, Bazuaye contends, <em>inter alia, </em>that his state conviction for attempted grand larceny in the third degree does not categorically match a \u201ctheft offense\u201d because New York law defines larceny in a variety of ways, encompassing some offenses that involve theft as well as some that involve fraud and deceit. <em>See </em>N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 155.05. Bazuaye claims that the statute under which he was convicted, N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 155.35, is divisible. <em>See Dickson v. Ashcroft, </em>346 F.3d 44, 48 (2d Cir.2003) (defining a \u201cdivisible statute\u201d as one that \u201cencompasses diverse classes of criminal acts \u2014 some of which would categorically be grounds for removal and others of which would not\u201d). Further, Bazuaye maintains that if his conviction includes both theft and fraud, we should adhere to the reasoning of the Third Circuit in <em>Nugent v. Ashcroft, </em>367 F.3d 162 (3d Cir.2004), and apply the requirements of \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G) and \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(M)(i) (offense involving fraud or deceit) to any such hybrid offense. <em>Id. </em>at 176.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">Subsequent to the BIA\u2019s order of removal, the agency modified its view on what constitutes a \u201ctheft offense\u201d under \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G). <em>See Matter of Liduina de Fatima Garcia-Madruga, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 436 (BIA 2008). After reviewing the Third Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Nugent </em>and the Fourth Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>Soliman v. Gonzales, </em>419 F.3d 276 (4th Cir.2005), the BIA concluded that \u201cthe offenses described in sections 101(a)(43)(G) and (M)(i) of the [Immigration and Nationality] Act ordinarily involve distinct crimes.\u201d 24 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 440. The BIA explained: \u201cWhereas the taking of property <em>without consent </em>is required for a section 101(a)(43)(G) \u2018theft offense,\u2019 a section 101(a)(43)(M)(i) \u2018offense that involves fraud or deceit\u2019 ordinarily involves the taking or acquisition of property with consent that has been fraudulently obtained.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Under this standard, the BIA held that an alien\u2019s state conviction for welfare fraud was not an aggravated felony under \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(G). <em>Id. </em>at 441.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-10\">In light of the agency\u2019s recent clarification, we question how it could sustain Bazuaye\u2019s order of removal. If N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 155.35 criminalizes the taking of property both with and without consent, Bazuaye\u2019s offense does not categorically fit within the BIA\u2019s amended definition of a \u201ctheft offense.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Dalton v. Ashcroft, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>257 F.3d 200, 204 (2d Cir.2001). Even assuming that N.Y. Penal Law \u00a7 155.35 is divisible, under a modified categorical approach the BIA must determine whether Bazuaye was convicted of a specific subsection of larceny that constitutes a \u201ctheft offense\u201d as that term is now interpreted. <em>See Dickson, </em>346 F.3d at 48-49. As Bazuaye observes, however, his charging papers and similar documents in the state court fail to identify under which subpart of the larceny statute he was convicted, much less contain any admission that he attempted to take property without the consent of its owner. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cIn reviewing a conviction under a divisible statute, the categorical approach permits reference to the record of conviction for the limited purpose of determining whether the alien\u2019s conviction was under the branch of the statute that permits removal.\u201d).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b105-5\">Nevertheless, because this case turns in substantial part on the BIA\u2019s definition of a \u201ctheft offense,\u201d we conclude that the best course is to remand this petition for the agency to have the opportunity to consider in the first instance whether Bazuaye is removable in light of <em>Matter of Liduina de Fatima Garcia-Madruga. See INS v. Orlando Ventura, </em>537 U.S. 12, 16, 123 S.Ct. 353, 154 L.Ed.2d 272 (2002) (\u201cGenerally speaking, a court of appeals should remand a case to an agency for decision of a matter that statutes place primarily in agency hands.\u201d). Upon remand, we urge the BIA to consider both our recent precedent explaining the parameters of the categorical and modified categorical approaches, <em>see Wala, </em>511 F.3d 102; <em>Dulal-Whiteway v. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec., </em>501 F.3d 116 (2d Cir.2007), and, should it deem necessary, the IJ\u2019s finding that Bazuaye was removable for having committed two crimes involving moral turpitude under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b105-9\">Insofar as Bazuaye argues that the BIA erred in denying his request for discretionary relief under INA \u00a7\u00a7 212(c) and 212(h), we need not reach the merits of this claim because the BIA\u2019s decision was premised on Bazuaye\u2019s removability for having committed an aggravated felony \u2014 the issue for which we are remanding this case. Further, to the extent Bazuaye raises additional claims in favor of terminating his removal proceedings, we need not decide whether these arguments furnish additional grounds for vacating the BIA\u2019s removal order.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-10\">For the reasons discussed, we GRANT the petition for review, VACATE the BIA\u2019s removal order, and REMAND to the BIA for further proceedings consistent with this order. The pending motion for a stay of removal is therefore DENIED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b104-6\">. We caution that we express no opinion as to the validity of the BIA\u2019s decision in <em>Matter of Liduina de Fatima Garcia-Madruga, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 436, or to whether it is the kind of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>decision to which <em>Chevron </em>deference is due, <em>see Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 842-43, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b105-7\">. The BIA has evinced some disagreement with <em>Dickson. See In re Babaisakov, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 306, 319-20 (BIA 2007) (noting that factual narratives in presentence reports, which this Court held in <em>Dickson </em>were not part of a petitioner's record of conviction for immigration purposes, can be considered in certain circumstances). We again express no opinion as to the validity of the BIA\u2019s decision, or to whether <em>Chevron </em>deference is due.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
