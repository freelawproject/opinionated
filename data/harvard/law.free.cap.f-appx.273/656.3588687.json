In No. 05-72084, Mahendra Kumar, a native and citizen of Fiji, petitions for review of the affirmance by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) of the denial by an Immigration Judge (IJ) of his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (CAT), and the derivative applications of his wife and two children. In No. 07-70265, Kumar petitions for review of the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen, which included his wife and his daughter. We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, and we deny the consolidated petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-14\">I. Petition No. 05-72084</p>\n<p id=\"b683-15\">To gain asylum Kumar must show he is unable or unwilling to return to Fiji because of persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of a protected ground, in this case his political opinion. <em>See Smolniakova v. Gonzales, </em>422 F.3d 1037, 1048 (9th Cir.2005). We review the IJ\u2019s opinion because the BIA affirmed without opinion, applying a substantial evidence standard under which \u201ccredibility findings will be upheld unless the evidence <em>compels </em>a contrary result.\u201d <em>Don v. Gonzales, </em>476 F.3d 738, 741 (9th Cir.2007) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p id=\"b683-16\">The IJ provided specific, cogent reasons to support his conclusion that Kumar was not credible, and those reasons go to the heart of Kumar\u2019s claim. <em>See id. </em>Kumar initially mentioned only two arrests. In his 2001 asylum interview, he stated he could not remember whether he had been arrested once or twice. At the hearing in 2004, he testified for the first time that he had been arrested three times. Kumar was vague and inconsistent about this third arrest. He gave two different descriptions of his release from the first arrest. Finally, he gave inconsistent testimony about the date that he joined the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"658\">*658</page-number>party. These inconsistencies go to the heart of Kumar\u2019s claim, and are substantial evidence supporting the adverse credibility finding. <em>See Kaur v. Gonzales, </em>418 F.3d 1061, 1067 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">It was not error to consider the asylum officer\u2019s report without the officer\u2019s testimony at Kumar\u2019s hearing. <em>See Ramos v. INS, </em>246 F.3d 1264, 1266 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">We lack jurisdiction to review the IJ\u2019s denial of Kumar\u2019s request for cancellation of removal. <em>See Martinez-Rosas v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 926, 929-30 (9th Cir.2005). Kumar does not challenge the denial of his requests for withholding of removal or relief under the Convention Against Torture, and so we do not address those issues. We deny the petition for review of the denial of his claim for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-6\">II. Petition No. 07-70265</p>\n<p id=\"b684-7\">We review the denial of a motion to reopen for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Granados-Oseguera v. Gonzales, </em>464 F.3d 993, 996 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-8\">The BIA denied Kumar\u2019s appeal from the IJ\u2019s denial of his asylum application on March 30, 2005. Kumar then had ninety days to file a motion to reopen with the BIA. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i); 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). Kumar filed his motion to reopen on June 26, 2006, a year and three months later. The BIA denied the motion as untimely, noting that Kumar\u2019s case did not present exceptional circumstances warranting sua sponte reopening.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-10\">The regulations require that a motion to reopen be filed within ninety days. Kumar\u2019s late motion contained no discussion of its timeliness, nor any argument that circumstances justified equitable tolling. <em>See Toufighi v. Mukasey, </em>510 F.3d 1059, 1063 n. 7 (9th Cir.2007). To the extent that Kumar argues that the BIA should have sua sponte reopened his case, we lack jurisdiction to consider the BIA\u2019s refusal to do so. <em>See id. </em>at 1063 n. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-15\">PETITIONS FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b683-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
