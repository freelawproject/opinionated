The district court granted the defendants\u2019 motions for summary judgment on grounds that Barnes offered only unsupported conclusions without presenting or adverting to any evidence that would have raised a genuine issue as to a material fact. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-24\">In opposition to the defendants\u2019 motions, which were supported by competent summary judgment evidence including affidavits, medical records, and a videotape of the use of limited force, Barnes offered only a \u201cmere scintilla\u201d of competent evidence and general conclusions, allegations, and speculation, which are insufficient to defeat summary judgment. <em>See Michaels v. Avitech, Inc., </em>202 F.3d 746, 754-55 (5th Cir.2000); <em>Alizadeh v. Safeway Stores, Inc., </em>802 F.2d 111, 113 (5th Cir.1986). In this court, Barnes repeats the allegations of his complaint with some embellishment but without pointing to any evidence in the record to support his specific claims of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"400\">*400</page-number>force or injury. Moreover, the videotape evidence demonstrates that Barnes\u2019s claims have no basis in fact or law and are therefore frivolous. <em>See Talib v. Gilley, </em>138 F.3d 211, 213 (5th Cir.1998). Barnes\u2019s appeal is dismissed as frivolous. 5th Cir. Rule 42.2. This dismissal counts as a strike for purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g). We warn Barnes that once he accumulates three strikes, he may not proceed in forma pauperis (IFP) in any civil action or appeal unless he \u201cis under imminent danger of serious physical injury.\u201d \u00a7 1915(g).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\">APPEAL DISMISSED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b425-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
