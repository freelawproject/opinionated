We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">Emery, a Washington resident, was inoculated with Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed (\u201cAVA\u201d) while serving in Texas aboard a ship under contract with the U.S. Navy. Emery subsequently developed erosive rheumatoid arthritis, which he attributes to his inoculation with AVA. Emery filed suit against BioPort, the Michigan-based manufacturer of AVA, in federal district court in Washington. That court dismissed his suit for lack of both specific and general personal jurisdiction. Emery appeals only from the district court\u2019s conclusion that it lacks general jurisdiction over his claim. We review the district court\u2019s determination de novo. <em>See Tuazon v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., </em>433 F.3d 1163, 1168 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">A court may exercise general jurisdiction where \u201ccontinuous corporate operations within a state [are] thought so substantial ... as to justify suit against it on causes of action arising from dealings entirely distinct from those activities.\u201d <em>Int\u2019l Shoe Co. v. Washington, </em>326 U.S. 310, 318, 66 S.Ct. 154, 90 L.Ed. 95 (1945). \u201cThe standard for establishing general jurisdiction is \u2018fairly high,\u2019 and requires that the defendant\u2019s contacts be of the sort that approximate physical presence.\u201d <em>Bancroft &amp; Masters, Inc. v. Augusta Nat\u2019l Inc., </em>223 F.3d 1082, 1086 (9th Cir.2000) (internal citations omitted). In determining whether this standard is met, we engage in a two-part inquiry, asking first whether the forum state\u2019s relevant statute permits the exercise of general jurisdiction and second whether that exercise of jurisdiction comports with federal due process requirements. <em>See Tuazon, </em>433 F.3d at 1169.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We conclude that an exercise of general jurisdiction in this case would comport with neither Washington law nor the analogous requirements of federal due process.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-11\">BioPort\u2019s contacts with Washington are insufficient to meet the \u201cfairly high\u201d standard that we require to establish general jurisdiction. <em>See Bancroft &amp; Masters, Inc., </em>223 F.3d at 1086 (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). BioPort has never maintained an office, employee, telephone, mailing address, or a registered agent for the service of process in Washington. The company does not own or lease real property in the state, nor is it licensed to do business there. BioPort\u2019s only contacts with Washington include the company\u2019s shipment of AVA to the state at the direction of the U.S. government, its limited (and as yet unsuccessful) attempts to sell AVA to the City of Seattle, and its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"696\">*696</page-number>business relationships with Washington companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-4\">The most significant of BioPort\u2019s contacts with Washington is with Hollister-Stier Laboratories. BioPort ships bulk tanks containing the AVA that it manufactures in Michigan to Hollister-Stier\u2019s Washington facility. Hollister-Stier then transfers the vaccine from the tanks into ten dose vials. The filled vials are then shipped back to Michigan and distributed from BioPort\u2019s headquarters in that state. Although the fact that a product manufactured by a corporation in State A is shipped to an independent contractor for transfer from bulk tanks into marketable containers in State B may mean that the corporation is \u201cdoing business <em>with </em>\u201d State B, it does not mean that the corporation is \u201cdoing business <em>in </em>\u201d State B for the purposes of establishing general jurisdiction. <em>See id. </em>(emphasis added) (holding California court lacked general jurisdiction over a company that had licensing agreements with California networks and vendors because the company was doing business with, but not in, the state).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">Because we conclude that BioPort\u2019s contacts with Washington, including its relationship with Hollister-Stier, are not the type of \u201ccontinuous and systematic general business contacts\u201d required for the assertion of general jurisdiction by both Washington law and the federal due process clause, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Emery\u2019s suit. <em>Helicopteros, </em>466 U.S. at 416, 104 S.Ct. 1868. <em>See also Tuazon, </em>433 F.3d at 1169.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b721-8\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b721-9\">. In the present case, the jurisdictional analysis under Washington's service of process statute, which \"confers [general] jurisdiction over a corporation that is 'doing business' in the state,\u201d <em>Tuazon, </em>433 F.3d at 1169 (citing <em>Crose v. Volkswagenwerk Aktiengesellschaft, </em>88 Wash.2d 50, 558 P.2d 764, 766 (1977)) (explaining that \"[a] company is doing business in Washington when it participates continuously and substantially in the state\u2019s markets\u201d), is analogous to the federal due process analysis which asks whether a defendant has \"continuous and systematic general business contacts\u201d with the forum state. <em>Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia, </em>S.A. <em>v. Hall, </em>466 U.S. 408, 416, 104 S.Ct. 1868, 80 L.Ed.2d 404 (1984). Accordingly, \"the statutory and constitutional standards merge into a single due process test.\u201d <em>Amoco Egypt Oil Co. v. Leonis Nav. Co., Inc., </em>1 F.3d 848, 851 (9th Cir. 1993) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
