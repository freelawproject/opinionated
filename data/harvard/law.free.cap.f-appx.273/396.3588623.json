Cooper\u2019s request for leave to proceed IFP in the district court was denied by the magistrate judge; when she failed to comply with an order to pay the requisite filing fee, the district court dismissed her complaint for failure to prosecute.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-18\">If necessary, this court must examine the basis of its jurisdiction sua sponte. <em>Mosley v. Cozby, </em>813 F.2d 659, 660 (5th Cir.1987). Following the magistrate\u2019s denial of leave to proceed IFP in the district court, Cooper filed a pleading entitled \u201cAppeal as of Right,\u201d which the district court clerk construed as a notice of an interlocutory appeal. However, the district court correctly construed this pleading as objections to the magistrate\u2019s order rather than a notice of appeal. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 72(a); <em>Donaldson v. Ducote, </em>373 F.3d 622, 624 (5th Cir.2004). Because Cooper has not filed any subsequent pleading that could be construed as a timely notice of appeal, this court lacks jurisdiction to consider her appeal. <em>See Bowles v. Russell, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2360, 2366, 168 L.Ed.2d 96 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b422-21\">APPEAL DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b422-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
