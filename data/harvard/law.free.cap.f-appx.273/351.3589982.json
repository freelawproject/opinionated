McConnell challenges the sentence arguing that the district court erred by considering that his embezzlement of funds from his employer was \u201crelated conduct\u201d for purposes of increasing his sentence. The false statements made to COF consisted of McConnell misrepresenting his whereabouts to COF on the sign-in/sign-out sheet by listing \u201cwork\u201d as his location upon leaving COF when he instead went to a local casino where he gambled with the money he had embezzled from his employer. The district judge imposed a sentence of nine months after concluding that the embezzlement from his employer was relevant conduct. For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-14\">I. Facts and Prior Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b378-15\">In 2004, McConnell was sentenced to serve a thirty-month term of imprisonment for violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 656 for theft, embezzlement, or misapplication by a bank officer or employee. He began serving this thirty-month term in November 2004. In July 2006, McConnell was transferred to COF to serve the remainder of his sentence. Pursuant to its agreement with the Bureau of Prisons, COF maintains certain records including an inmate sign-in/ sign-out log.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-16\">McConnell received a handbook upon his arrival at COF, which explained that the staff at COF must at all times know a resident\u2019s location and that the resident is accountable for advising the staff of his whereabouts. McConnell was also informed of the following requirements: that when he left COF, he was required to sign out; that when he arrived at his destination, he was to call and report his arrival; that before leaving his destination, he was required to report his imminent return to COF; and that upon his arrival at COF, he was then required to sign in.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-17\">McConnell obtained employment at Hal-tom Construction Company (\u201cHaltom\u201d) in Marshall, Texas shortly after arriving at COF in July 2006. During his employment at Haltom, McConnell embezzled $80,000.00. Before the offense was detected, McConnell had repaid $54,000.00, leaving a balance of $24,000.00 unpaid at the time the offense was detected. Upon his repayment of the remaining $24,000.00, a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>Harrison County Grand Jury no true billed him, and the Texas state charges were dropped.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">McConnell was indicted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> for making false misrepresentations or statements to COF, including misrepresenting his location on COF\u2019s sign-in/sign-out log. He pled guilty to one count of the indictment, which charged that on September 26, 2006, he reported to COF that he was at work when in fact he was at a casino for much of the day. McConnell began his play at the black jack table by cashing an $8,000.00 check from Haltom, payable to McConnell and dated that same day.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">Prior to sentencing, the government argued that McConnell\u2019s $80,000.00 embezzlement should be included in his relevant conduct to enhance his guideline sentencing range by eight levels, resulting in an offense level of 12 with a criminal history category of III and an imprisonment range of fifteen to twenty-one months. The district court agreed that the embezzlement constituted relevant conduct, however it found that because McConnell had repaid $56,000.00 of the $80,000.00 by the time the offense was detected, the amount of loss for relevant conduct was reduced to $24,000.00.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Thus, the district court found that the relevant conduct increased McConnell\u2019s offense level to 8 and sentenced him to nine months, which is within the applicable six to twelve month guideline range. McConnell timely appeals, arguing that the district court erred by considering the embezzlement to be relevant conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-15\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b379-16\">After <em>Booker</em><footnotemark><em>3</em></footnotemark><em> </em>this Court reviews a district court\u2019s inteipretation and application of the sentencing guidelines <em>de novo </em>and reviews its findings of fact for clear error.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The determination of relevant conduct is a finding of fact reviewed for clear error.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> To determine an appropriate sentence, a district court must consider a properly calculated guideline sentencing range and the sentencing factors in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> This Court may apply a presumption of reasonableness to a district court sentence that reflects a proper appli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>cation of the Sentencing Guidelines.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Ayo\">III. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">The district court found that McConnell\u2019s sentence for his violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 should be enhanced by his embezzlement from Haltom as relevant conduct, pursuant to Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 1B1.3. McConnell argues that the court erred in considering this as relevant conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">To determine whether the district court properly applied the guidelines, we look first to the language of \u00a7 1B1.3. Section lB1.3(a)(l) provides that for the conduct in question to be relevant conduct that would enhance a defendant\u2019s sentence, it must be conduct by the defendant \u201cthat occurred during the commission of the offense of conviction, in preparation for that offense, or in the course of attempting to avoid detection or responsibility for that offense.\u201d <footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Section lB1.3(a)(2) provides that relevant conduct includes, \u201csolely with respect to offenses of a character for which \u00a7 3D1.2(d) would require grouping of multiple counts, all acts and omissions ... [of defendant] that were part of [1] the same course of conduct or [2] common scheme or plan as the offense of conviction.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"A8tH\">Further, according to the Sentencing Guidelines Commentary to \u00a7 1B1.3, offenses may qualify as being in the same course of conduct for purposes of \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(2) \u201cif they are sufficiently connected or related to each other as to warrant the conclusion that they are part of a single episode, spree, or ongoing series of offenses.\u201d<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Alternatively, \u201c[f]or two or more offenses to constitute part of a common scheme or plan, they must be substantially connected to each other by at least one common factor, such as common victims, common accomplices, common purpose, or similar <em>modus </em>operandi.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Further, \u201c[i]t is not necessary for the defendant to have been charged with or convicted of carrying out the other acts before they can be considered relevant conduct. However, for the acts to constitute relevant conduct, the conduct must be criminal.\u201d <footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Finally, in discussing the breadth of relevant conduct applicable pursuant to \u00a7 1B1.3, this Court has explained that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b380-14\">conduct that is not an element of the offense of conviction may enter into the district court\u2019s determination of the applicable guideline range____One of the clear purposes of \u00a7 1B1.3 of the guidelines is to include different transactions that are relevant to the charged conduct, particularly if they are part of a common scheme or plan. To accord with this purpose, we have consistently interpreted relevant conduct broadly.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>The government argues that \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(2) applies because McConnell made false statements to conceal the fact that he was gambling at the casino and misappropriated funds from his employer to facilitate such gambling, and that as such, these acts constituted either the same course of conduct or a common scheme or plan of gambling.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">According to \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(2), we must first inquire whether we are dealing with offenses the character of which would require grouping of multiple counts under \u00a7 3D1.2(d). Section 2B1.1 is the guideline applicable to both embezzlement and violations of \u00a7 1001, the statute under which McConnell was convicted. Offenses covered by \u00a7 2B1.1 are specifically listed among those which shall be grouped together under \u00a7 3D1.2(d). Thus, the Hal-tom embezzlement can be grouped with McConnell\u2019s \u00a7 1001 false statement offense under \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(2). Secondly, we agree with the government that \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(2) applies because the district court was entitled to find that McConnell committed the embezzlement and made the false statements as part of a common scheme or plan to permit him to go to the casino and gamble. Under the common scheme or plan analysis, the guidelines only require that the two offenses \u201cbe substantially connected to each other by at least one common factor.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> We have also explained that the words \u201c \u2018scheme\u2019 and \u2018plan\u2019 are \u2018words of intention, implying that the [offenses were] jointly planned, or at least that it have been evident [sic] that the commission of one would entail the commission of the other as well.\u2019 \u201d <footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">Here, where the common purpose of gambling applies to both the offense of lying to COF and to the embezzlement, this test is clearly met. As the district court explained: \u201cHow can you find a more seamless web than you file a false statement to go out of the halfway house to go to your employer to get money to go to the casino? That\u2019s as seamless as it gets to be.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">McConnell argues, however, that the common purpose in this test must be a criminal purpose for this guideline to apply. This argument is inconsistent with our case law. We have previously held that a non-criminal purpose satisfies the common purpose factor for relevant conduct.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-11\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b381-12\">Based on the foregoing reasons, we affirm McConnell\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-13\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b378-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
