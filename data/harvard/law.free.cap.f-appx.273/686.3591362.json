We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. \u201cWe review a district court\u2019s denial of attorneys\u2019 fees under the EAJA for an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Akopyan v. Barnhart, </em>296 F.3d 852, 856 (9th Cir.2002). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-21\">Sanchez\u2019s motion for attorneys\u2019 fees under EAJA was untimely because it was not filed until June 21, 2006, more than thirty days after the district court\u2019s judgment of remand pursuant to sentence four of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 405(g), which was filed on August 11, 2005, and became final on October 10, 2005. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2412(d)(1)(B) (\u201cA party seeking an award of fees and other expenses shall, within thirty days of final judgment in the action, submit to the court an application for fees and other expenses....\u201d); <em>Shalala v. Schaefer, </em>509 U.S. 292, 297, 113 S.Ct. 2625, 125 L.Ed.2d 239 (1993) (\u201c[It is not] possible to argue that the judgment authorized by sentence four, if it includes a remand, does not become a \u2018final judgment\u2019 \u2014 as required by \u00a7 2412(d) \u2014 upon expiration of the time for appeal.\u201d); Fed. R.App. P. 4(a)(1)(B) (\u201cWhen the United States or its officer or agency is a party, the notice of appeal may be filed by any party within 60 days after the judgment or order appealed from is entered.\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b712-22\">Sanchez\u2019s invocation of the doctrine of equitable tolling is inapposite and does not cure the motion\u2019s untimeliness. Even if we assume <em>arguendo </em>that the thirty-day deadline for EAJA applications may be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>subject to equitable tolling under appropriate circumstances, those circumstances are not present in this case. <em>Cf. Scarborough v. Principi, </em>541 U.S. 401, 421 n. 8, 124 S.Ct. 1856, 158 L.Ed.2d 674 (2004) (explicitly reserving the question of the applicability of equitable tolling in an EAJA fees dispute arising out of a disability benefits case). Even if, as she claims, Sanchez\u2019s counsel, Stephanie Simpson, did not receive a copy of the district court\u2019s judgment filed on August 11, 2005, it is undisputed that she had received the Report and Recommendation filed by the magistrate judge on July 8, 2005. Therefore, she was on notice that the district court might enter judgment in the immediate future. Her failure to periodically check the court\u2019s docket to determine whether the district court had filed a judgment amounts \u201cat best [to] a garden variety claim of excusable neglect,\u201d which does not entitle her or Sanchez to equitable tolling.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Irwin v. Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, </em>498 U.S. 89, 96, 111 S.Ct. 453, 112 L.Ed.2d 435 (1990); <em>see also </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 77(d)(2) (\u201cLack of notice of the entry [of judgment or order] does not affect the time for appeal or relieve \u2014 or authorize the court to relieve \u2014 a party for failing to appeal within the time allowed, except as allowed by Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure (4)(a).\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b713-5\">Finally, the district court did not abuse its discretion in rejecting Sanchez\u2019s contention that the Commissioner waived the defense of untimeliness in a telephone conversation between Assistant Regional Counsel Caryn Goot and Simpson that took place on June 15, 2006. Insofar as waiver is concerned, the parties have offered diametrically opposite versions of the June 15, 2006, conversation. In light of the contemporaneous e-mail messages submitted by the government in support of the Commissioner\u2019s recollection of the June 15, 2006, conversation, it was not erroneous for the district court to accept the Commissioner\u2019s testimony and exhibits, and to resolve the evidentiary conflict in his favor.</p>\n<p id=\"b713-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b712-23\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b712-24\">.
