The order dismisses Se-gal\u2019s appeal from a July 6, 2004 decision of Immigration Judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) Paul A. DeFonzo denying Segal a waiver of inadmissibility pursuant to section 212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c) (repealed). <em>See In re Zalman Segal, </em>No. A36 856 084, 2006 WL 1647440 (B.I.A. May 15, 2006), <em>affg </em>No. A36 856 084 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City July 6, 2004). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the procedural history, facts, and relevant issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-11\">In the absence of a constitutional or legal issue, we do not have jurisdiction to review final orders of removal against aliens deemed by the BIA to be removable for having been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C). We also lack jurisdiction to review purely discretionary decisions. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii). The REAL ID Act, however, restored our jurisdiction over constitutional claims and questions of law. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D); <em>Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 324 (2d Cir.2006) (hereinafter, <em>\u201cXiao Ji Chen II\u201d). </em>We also retain jurisdiction to determine our own jurisdiction over a petition for review. <em>See Kuhali v. Reno, </em>266 F.3d 93, 100 (2d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b70-12\">\u201cTo determine whether we have jurisdiction ... we must \u2018study the arguments asserted ... [and] determine, regardless of the rhetoric employed in the petition, whether it merely quarrels over the correctness of the factual findings or justification for the discretionary choices\u2019 made by the BIA,\u201d <em>Noble v. Keisler, </em>505 F.3d 73, 78 (2d Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Xiao Ji Chen II, </em>471 F.3d at 329 (second and third alterations in original)), or whether instead it raises a colorable <em>(i. e., </em>nonfrivolous) constitutional claim or question of law, <em>Barco-Sandoval v. Gonzales, </em>516 F.3d 35, 40 (2d Cir.2008). \u201c[A] question of law may \u2018arise for example in fact-finding which is flawed by an error of law\u2019 \u201d \u2014 such as where the IJ unambiguously mischaracterizes the record \u2014 \u201cor \u2018where a discretionary decision is argued to be an abuse of discretion because it was made without rational justification or based on a legally erroneous standard.\u2019 \u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number><em>Gui Yin Liu v. INS, </em>508 F.3d 716, 721 (2d Cir.2007) (per curiam) (quoting <em>Xiao Ji Chen II, </em>471 F.3d at 329); <em>accord Khan v. Gonzales, </em>495 F.3d 31, 35 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">Petitioner first claims that the IJ made factual errors that are so egregious as to amount to errors of law: He contends that two of the IJ\u2019s findings \u2014 that he failed to inform New York State of his immigration status when he applied for public assistance and that he lied and equivocated when asked about his criminal past during a 1988 immigration hearing\u2014 are belied by unambiguous record evidence to the contrary. Petitioner further contends that the IJ \u201csignificantly understated\u201d his length of residence in the U.S. Having studied these arguments and the record, however, we conclude that Petitioner has not identified a question of law but rather has quibbled with the IJ\u2019s fact-finding and his weighing of discretionary factors. Such arguments are insufficient to invoke our jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">We also lack jurisdiction to review Petitioner\u2019s second argument, which is that the IJ engaged in \u201cfaulty reasoning\u201d when, in weighing the positive and negative equities bearing on Petitioner\u2019s application, he stated that he was \u201cchilled\u201d at Petitioner\u2019s willingness to apply for and procure public benefits in 1999 and that he was further \u201cchilled\u201d by the thought of people subjecting themselves to Petitioner\u2019s hypnotherapy services. Given the context, the IJ\u2019s statements did not amount to an error of law. The IJ\u2019s discussion of Petitioner\u2019s stint on public assistance pertained to Petitioner\u2019s lack of candor on the application, not to his need for public support. The IJ expressed concern about Petitioner\u2019s hypnotherapy practice because of Petitioner\u2019s history of fraud, and, in any case, he made that comment after concluding, on other grounds, that Petitioner was undeserving of a positive exercise of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-7\">Petitioner\u2019s final argument, however, is a legal one, over which we have jurisdiction: he contends that in evaluating his 212(c) application, the IJ misapplied binding BIA precedent regarding how to exercise the Attorney General\u2019s discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-8\">When an Immigration Court is faced with a 212(c) petition from an eligible petitioner, it must consider \u201call the facts and circumstances involved\u201d and \u201cbalanc[e] ... the social and humane considerations presented in an alien\u2019s favor against the adverse factors evidencing his undesirability as a permanent resident.\u201d <em>Matter of Edwards, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 191, 195 (B.I.A. 1990); <em>accord Lovell v. INS, </em>52 F.3d 458, 461 (2d Cir.1995). Favorable considerations, according to the BIA, include residence of long duration in the U.S., evidence of hardship to the alien and to his family should deportation occur, a history of employment, \u201cand other evidence attesting to a respondent\u2019s good character.\u201d <em>Matter of Edwards, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 195. Adverse factors include \u201cthe nature and underlying circumstances of the exclusion or deportation ground at issue, ... the existence of a criminal record and, if so, its nature, recency, and seriousness, and the presence of other evidence indicative of a respondent\u2019s bad character or undesirability as a permanent resident of this country.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b71-9\">Contrary to BIA guidance, the IJ characterized as adverse some factors that are not legally relevant to bad character or undesirability as a permanent resident, such as Petitioner\u2019s divorce from his U.S. citizen wife and the fact that his immediate family is in Israel. These findings are relevant to the existence of hardship, a positive equity, but they are not <em>negative </em>equities. In categorizing them as such, the IJ misapplied what we have referred to as a \u201clegal standard,\u201d <em>see, e.g., Khan, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>495 F.3d at 35, and violated the Code of Federal Regulations, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(g) (\u201c[D]ecisions of the Board ... shall be binding on all ... immigration judges in the administration of the immigration laws of the United States.\u201d). And in failing to correct that error on review, the BIA committed an error of law. \u201cWhile the Board is free to modify its precedents in a reasoned fashion, it acts arbitrarily and unlawfully when it simply ignores established holdings.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 164, 171 (2d Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b72-4\">The factors considered were, however, not improperly reviewed; they were simply listed by the IJ on the wrong side of an equation. As a result, we are \u201cconfident that the agency would reach the same result upon a reconsideration cleansed of errors\u201d and conclude that a remand in this case would be futile. <em>Lin Zhong v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>480 F.3d 104, 117 (2d Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted). The IJ\u2019s most recent decision in this case represents the third consideration of Petitioner\u2019s 212(c) petition and its third determination that, despite the positive equities that Petitioner has presented, he does not deserve a waiver of exclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">We have considered all of Petitioner\u2019s arguments. Some quarrel with the IJ\u2019s fact finding and discretionary choices, and so we lack jurisdiction to consider them. The others are without merit. Accordingly, the petition for review is DISMISSED in part and DENIED in part. The pending motion for a stay of deportation/removal is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
