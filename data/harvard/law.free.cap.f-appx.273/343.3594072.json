Accordingly, his claims that the district court erred in calculating his base offense level and his criminal history are barred under the plea agreement. <em>See United States v. Bond, </em>414 F.3d 542, 544 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-9\">Okuribido also challenges the district court\u2019s 96 month sentence as unreasonable. The sentence represented a two-level upward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3. Because Okuribido did not object to the district court\u2019s upward departure, his argument is reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. Jones, </em>444 F.3d 430, 436 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>548 U.S. 915, 126 S.Ct. 2958, 165 L.Ed.2d 970 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b370-10\">Contrary to Okuribido\u2019s argument, uncounted convictions may provide a basis for an upward departure. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(2)(A); <em>United States v. Alford, </em>142 F.3d 825, 831 (5th Cir.1998). Further, repeated acts of similar criminal activity are an acceptable basis for an upward departure. <em>See </em>\u00a7 4A1.3(a)(l); <em>United States v. Medina-Gutierrez, </em>980 F.2d 980, 984 (5th Cir.1992). Thus, although Okuribido\u2019s prior convictions were counted toward his criminal history score, his recidivism is an independent factor warranting an upward departure. Further, the record reveals that Okuribido was a habitual criminal alien whose crimes became progressively more serious and sophisticated. It was thus not unreasonable for the court to give Okuribido an upward departure of two levels. <em>See United States v. Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d 345, 347 (5th Cir.2006). Okuribido has failed to establish that his sentence was plainly erroneous. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b370-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
