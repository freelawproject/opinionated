Zeugner-Maynard and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs jointly respond to the court\u2019s December 4, 2007 order and move to vacate the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims in <em>Zeugner-Maynard v. Principi, </em>01-1738, 2004 WL 1576399 (June 21, 2004) and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-32\">This case was stayed pending the court\u2019s disposition in <em>Roan v. Principi, </em>2004-7093, which was stayed pending the court\u2019s disposition in <em>Sanders v. Nicholson, </em>487 F.3d 881 (Fed.Cir.2007), and its companion case <em>Simmons v. Nicholson, </em>487 F.3d 892 (Fed. Cir.2007). Subsequently, this court issued its decision in <em>Sanders, </em>which held that the initial burden is on the Secretary to prove that any 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5103(a) notice error was nonprejudicial. In <em>Sanders, </em>we fur<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>ther stated that \u201cthe claimant bears the burden of demonstrating error in the VCAA [Veterans Claims Assistance Act] notice.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 891.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">The parties state that in this case, Zeugner-Maynard made an intentional decision not to raise the issue of whether a VCAA notice error had occurred. However, the parties argue that the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims nevertheless determined that there had been a notice error. The parties assert that the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims\u2019 decision is not consistent with our decision in <em>Sanders </em>and thus we should vacate and remand. The court agrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b935-7\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b935-8\">(1) The motion to vacate and remand is granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-9\">(2) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
