Principi, </em>02-8, 2004 WL 1631397 (July 15, 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b912-21\">The Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals denied Arnold D. McCowan\u2019s claim for an increased rating for a medial meniscal tear, right knee, with traumatic arthritis. The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims vacated the Board\u2019s decision and remanded the case to the Board, and the Secretary appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-22\">This case was stayed pending the court\u2019s disposition in <em>Roan v. Principi, </em>2004-7093, which was stayed pending the court\u2019s disposition in <em>Sanders v. Nicholson, </em>487 F.3d 881 (Fed.Cir.2007), and its companion case <em>Simmons v. Nicholson, </em>487 F.3d 892 (Fed. Cir.2007). In <em>Sanders, </em>this court held that any 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5103(a) error should be presumed prejudicial and the Secretary has the burden of rebutting this presumption. <em>Id. </em>at 891.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-23\">The court agrees that summary affirmance of the judgment vacating and remanding to the Board is appropriate in light of our decisions in <em>Simmons </em>and <em>Sanders.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b912-24\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b912-25\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b912-26\">(1) The stay of proceedings is lifted.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-27\">(2) The judgment of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims is summarily affirmed. The case is remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b912-28\">(3) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
