(\u201cVolvo\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s judgment entered on the jury\u2019s verdict in favor of defendant Crescent Ford Truck Sales, Inc. (\u201cCrescent\u201d) on its breach of contract claim. Crescent cross-appeals the jury\u2019s finding, as incorporated into the judgment, that it breached its dealer agreement with Volvo by failing to procure a customer\u2019s signature on the warranty registration. Because we find that subject matter jurisdiction does not exist in this case, however, we VACATE the judgment and REMAND to the district court with instructions to DISMISS the case without prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-24\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-25\">On November 3, 1999, Luciano Refrigerated Transport, Inc. (\u201cLuciano\u201d) initiated an adversary proceeding against Volvo in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. On November 15, 2000, Volvo filed a third-party demand against Crescent. However, on January 9, 2000, Volvo entered into an agreement to settle Luciano\u2019s claims. On October 30, 2002, the bankruptcy court dismissed the claims remaining between Volvo and Crescent without prejudice for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, concluding that they were not \u201crelated to\u201d the Luciano bankruptcy for the purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334(b). Neither Volvo nor Crescent appealed the bankruptcy court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-5\">Instead, on November 13, 2002, Volvo filed the instant breach-of-contract case in district court, alleging 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332 diversity jurisdiction. The case went to trial, resulting in a jury verdict and final judgment, from which both Volvo and Crescent have appealed. At oral argument, Volvo brought the lack of diversity jurisdiction to the attention of this court and sought to amend the pleadings to cure this jurisdictional defect, as permitted by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1653, by invoking 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334(b)\u2019s jurisdictional provision for \u201ccivil proceedings ... related to cases under title 11.\u201d After a close review of the record, however, we conclude that there is no basis for federal jurisdiction in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-7\">A federal court may examine its subject matter jurisdiction at any time during a case. <em>Bass v. Denney (In re Bass), 171 </em>F.3d 1016, 1021 (5th Cir.1999). Whether a federal court has subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law that we review de novo. <em>Gasch v. Hartford Accident &amp; Indent. Co., </em>491 F.3d 278, 281 (5th Cir.2007). This case proceeded in the district court under alleged diversity jurisdiction. However, as Volvo suggested at oral argument, diversity jurisdiction is lacking because both parties are incorporated in Delaware. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-9\">Volvo now seeks to alter the basis for federal jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1653, arguing that it is apparent from the face of its complaint that the federal forum is available in this case under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334(b) because the claims are \u201crelated to\u201d Luciano\u2019s bankruptcy proceedings. But the bankruptcy court decided this issue in a final, unappealed order, dismissing Volvo\u2019s third-party claim against Crescent without prejudice for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-10\">In light of the bankruptcy court\u2019s order, principles of collateral estoppel require the conclusion that there is no related-to-bankruptcy jurisdiction in this case. In any event, we agree with the bankruptcy court that the claims between Volvo and Crescent are not \u201crelated to\u201d the Luciano bankruptcy under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b395-11\">As the bankruptcy court correctly set out, a \u201cproceeding is related to a bankruptcy if the outcome of that proceeding could conceivably have any effect on the estate being administered in bankruptcy.\u201d <em>In re Bass, 171 </em>F.3d at 1022 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also Celotex Corp. v. Edwards, </em>514 U.S. 300, 308 n. 6, 115 S.Ct. 1493, 131 L.Ed.2d 403 (1995). In other words, an \u201caction is related to bankruptcy if the outcome could alter the debtor\u2019s rights, liabilities, options, or freedom of action (either positively or negatively) and ... in any way impacts upon the handling and administration of the bankruptcy estate.\u201d <em>In re Bass, </em>171 F.3d at 1022 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Further, related-to-bankruptcy jurisdiction does not exist \u201cover proceedings that have no effect on the debtor.\u201d <em>Walker v. Cadle (In re Walker), </em>51 F.3d 562, 569 (5th Cir.1995) (quoting <em>Celotex, </em>514 U.S. at 308, 115 S.Ct. 1493).</p>\n<p id=\"b396-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>In <em>In re Walker, </em>we affirmed the district court\u2019s decision that neither it nor the bankruptcy court had subject matter jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334(b) over a third-party complaint in an adversary proceeding to determine whether the third-party defendant should be required to reimburse the defendant for any money found owing to the debtor. <em>Id. </em>We concluded that the defendant\u2019s claim against the third-party defendant had \u201cno \u2018conceivable effect on the administration of the estate\u2019 nor would the outcome of that claim \u2018alter the debtor\u2019s rights, liabilities, options, or freedom of action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>We explained that it was \u201cdifficult to imagine that whether [the third-party defendant] should be required to reimburse [the defendant] for any money [the defendant] pays to [the debtor] could somehow affect the estate.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b396-4\">In this case, Volvo settled Luciano\u2019s claims against it on January 9, 2000. The bankruptcy court subsequently dismissed Volvo\u2019s third-party complaint because \u201cVolvo Truck\u2019s third-party claim against Crescent will not have any [e]ffect on the [d]ebtor\u2019s estate.\u201d <em>Luciano Refrigerated Transp., Inc. v. Volvo Trucks N. Am., Inc., </em>No. 99-1244, slip op. at 4 (Bankr.E.D.La. Oct. 30, 2002). We agree. As was the case in <em>In re Walker, </em>we cannot conceive of any way in which the determination of whether Crescent is liable to Volvo for breach of contract damages could possibly affect Luciano\u2019s bankruptcy estate or alter his \u201crights, liabilities, options, or freedom of action.\u201d Therefore, this case is not \u201crelated to\u201d the Luciano bankruptcy for the purposes of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1334(b) subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">Consequently, we VACATE the judgment and REMAND to the district court with instructions to DISMISS the case without prejudice. Costs shall be borne by Volvo.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b394-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
