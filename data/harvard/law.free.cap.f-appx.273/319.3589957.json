The IRS was attempting to determine to what extent the government could collect the taxes Stafford owed for that three-year period. To that end, the summons required Stafford to produce documents and give testimony about his assets and liabilities from June 2005 until the date of compliance with the summons. Stafford invoked his Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate himself and refused to produce any documents or answer most of the IRS\u2019s questions. The United States then filed suit to enforce the summons. After a hearing, the district court ordered Stafford to comply with the summons. Stafford appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"AyU\">The Fifth Amendment\u2019s self-incrimination privilege \u201capplies only when the accused is compelled to make a testimonial communication that is incriminating.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> For a defendant to avail himself of the privilege, however, he must do more than simply make a blanket assertion of the privilege.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A court cannot just rely on a defendant\u2019s claim that responding to certain questions might tend to be incriminating. That would allow a defendant to agsert fche prMlege even where the risk of incrimination is remote or entirely imag_ ined.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At the same time, the defendant cannot be expected to explain in detail in 0pen COurt what testimonial communication he would make that would tend to incriminate him, as that would eviscerate the very purpose of the privilege.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> To balance these two concerns:</p>\n<p id=\"A2Z\">^ practice has developed whereby - \u2022 \u2022 the [individual asserting the privilege] will allude in very general, circumstantial terms to the reasons why he feels he might be incriminated by answering a given question. The judge [will then] examine! ] him only far enough to determine whether there is reasonable ground to apprehend danger to the witness from his being compelled to answer. If the danger <em>might </em>exist, the court must uphold the privilege without requiring the witness to demonstrate that a response <em>would </em>incriminate him, the latter inquiry being barred by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>the privilege itself.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AVe8\">In short, this inquiry requires a court to examine the appropriateness of the privilege on an individualized basis so that the court can determine whether the defendant faces a real risk of incriminating himself by answering a specific question (or group of related questions).</p>\n<p id=\"ANW\">Here, Stafford invoked the privilege to prevent the IRS from obtaining documents on his financial situation and from asking him at least some questions related to that topic. As far as reusing to answer questions, Stafford has not detailed <em>any </em>of the questions he refiised to answer. That lack of detail deprived the district court of its ability to judge the risk posed to Stafford with respect to any given question. As far as Stafford\u2019s refusal to turn over documents, Stafford made no attempt to explain how the testimonial aspect of his turning over the relevant documents could tend to incriminate him.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Indeed, he makes no attempt to tether his concerns about being prosecuted with any of the varied sub-categories of documents subsumed by the IRS\u2019s document request (e.g., stocks, life insurance policies, checkbooks, cancelled checks). Instead, he tries to rely on a generalized fear based on his past interactions with the IRS that <em>any </em>document that could possibly be covered by the request would tend to incriminate him. That is not a proper use of the privilege.</p>\n<p id=\"APU\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"AgG\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
