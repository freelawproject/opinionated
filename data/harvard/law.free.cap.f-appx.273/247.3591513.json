We have reviewed the record and find no reversible error. Accordingly, we affirm for the reasons stated by the district court.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> <em>Manship v. Trodden, </em>No. 1:07-cv-00772TSE-TCB, 2007 WL 3143559 (E.D. Va. Oct. 22, 2007). We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b274-11\"> Manship also complains that the district court did not specifically respond to his request for a court-appointed attorney. Although under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(1) (2000), a court may request an attorney to represent an indigent party in a civil case, a court should do so only in exceptional circumstances. <em>Cook v. Bounds, </em>518 F.2d 779, 780 (4th Cir.1975). The district court's determination that Man-ship did not present exceptional circumstances warranting appointment of counsel was implicit in the dismissal of his complaint.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
