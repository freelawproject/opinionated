In 1994, he pled guilty to a charge of lewd acts upon a child in violation of CahPenal Code \u00a7 288(a). The government initiated removal proceedings, and Reyes did not dispute that he was removable for having committed an aggravated felony. He sought relief from removal in the form of a discretionary waiver of inadmissibility under former \u00a7 212(c) of the INA, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(c) (1994) (repealed). The immigration judge (\u201cIJ\u201d) found that Reyes met the statutory prerequisites for the waiver, but that he did not merit the favorable exercise of discretion. The IJ held that Reyes\u2019 conviction was for a \u201cserious crime\u201d and therefore that he had the burden of demonstrating \u201coutstanding and unusual\u201d hardships should he be removed. <em>See Matter of Buscemi, </em>19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 628, 633 (BIA 1988). The IJ concluded that Reyes failed to meet the heightened standard and therefore denied the waiver. The BIA affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-21\">Reyes timely petitioned for review to this court. His sole substantive contention is that his conviction was not a \u201cserious crime\u201d that merited the heightened \u201coutstanding and unusual\u201d hardships standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-22\">We lack jurisdiction to consider this argument. \u201cDiscretionary decisions, including whether or not to grant \u00a7 212(c) relief, are not reviewable.\u201d <em>Vargas-Hernandez </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"676\">*676</page-number><em>v. Gonzales, </em>497 F.3d 919, 923 (9th Cir. 2007) (citing 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii)). The \u201cserious crime\u201d determination is discretionary and not a question of law. <em>See Romero-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>327 F.3d 887, 891 (9th Cir.2003) (\u201c[A]n inquiry is discretionary where it is a subjective question that depends on the value judgment of the person or entity examining the issue.\u201d (citation and quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">We also lack jurisdiction because Reyes is removable by reason of his criminal offense. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">PETITION DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b701-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
