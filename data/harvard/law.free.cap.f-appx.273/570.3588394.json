In this petition for review, Rubio argues that the IJ violated her due process rights by ruling on her application for cancellation of removal on an incomplete record.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">We have jurisdiction to consider Rubio\u2019s due process challenge, <em>see Munoz-Yepez v. Gonzales, </em>465 F.3d 347, 351 (8th Cir.2006), but we cannot say that her due process rights were violated. The missing documents were described at the merits hearing, and the IJ had before him an index of those documents. Further, the information was relevant to the issues of good moral character and presence in the United States, both of which the IJ decided in Rubio\u2019s favor. Rubio has failed to show how she was prejudiced by proceeding without the documents at issue. <em>See Flores v. Ashcroft, </em>354 F.3d 727, 729-30 (8th Cir.2003) (review of constitutional claims is de novo); <em>Lopez v. Heinauer, </em>332 F.3d 507, 512-13 (8th Cir.2003) (to establish violation of due process, alien must demonstrate both fundamental procedural error and that error resulted in prejudice).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">Although Rubio also purports to raise a due process challenge to the IJ\u2019s \u201cdisregard of applicable case law,\u201d she is essentially attacking the substance of the IJ\u2019s decision, which is unreviewable. <em>See Zacarias-Velasquez v. Mukasey, </em>509 F.3d 429, 434 (8th Cir.2007) (appellate court lacks jurisdiction to review cancellation-of-removal decision because it is type of discretionary determination that Congress shielded from appellate review); <em>Meraz-Reyes v. Gonzales, </em>436 F.3d 842, 843 (8th Cir.2006) (per curiam) (\u201ca petitioner may not create the jurisdiction that Congress chose to remove simply by cloaking an abuse of discretion argument in constitutional garb\u201d) (quoting <em>Toms-Aguilar v. INS, </em>246 F.3d 1267, 1271 (9th Cir.2001)).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-10\">Accordingly, we deny the petition.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
