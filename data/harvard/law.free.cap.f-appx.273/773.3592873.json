We grant Polk\u2019s request to proceed <em>in forma pauperis. </em>Nevertheless, because Polk has not \u201cmade a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d this court denies his request for a COA and dismisses this appeal. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2253(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-15\">Polk was convicted in Oklahoma state court of one count of attempted second degree burglary after previous convictions of two or more felonies. He was sentenced to a thirty-year term of imprisonment. After exhausting his state court remedies, Polk brought the instant \u00a7 2254 habeas petition raising the following four claims: (1) his conviction is not supported by sufficient evidence; (2) the trial court\u2019s sentencing instructions were erroneous; (3) the prosecutor engaged in misconduct at trial, depriving him of a fair proceeding; and (4) trial counsel was ineffective in (a) failing to impeach a prosecution witness with his grand jury testimony, (b) failing to object to the trial court\u2019s sentencing instruction, and (c) failing to object to the prosecutor\u2019s allegedly improper questions and comments. Polk\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition was assigned to a magistrate judge for initial proceedings pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-16\">The magistrate judge issued a comprehensive Report and Recommendation, rec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"775\">*775</page-number>ommending that Polk\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition be denied. Applying the standards set out in the AEDPA, the magistrate judge reviewed the trial record and concluded the state court\u2019s resolution of Polk\u2019s sufficiency claim was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979), and was not based on an unreasonable determination of the facts. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d). The magistrate judge concluded Polk\u2019s claim of instructional error failed because the trial court\u2019s sentencing instruction was consistent with state law and thus presented no federal habeas issue. Okla. Stat. tit. 21, \u00a7 51.1(c) (providing for a maximum sen-fence of life imprisonment for habitual offenders); <em>Dennis v. Poppel, </em>222 F.3d 1245, 1258 (10th Cir.2000) (holding that federal habeas review of a state sentence \u201cends once we determine the sentence is within the limitation set by statute\u201d). The magistrate judge concluded Polk\u2019s claims of prosecutorial misconduct failed because the questions and comments of the prosecutor were proper avenues of cross-examination and/or comments on the evidence adduced at trial. Finally, the magistrate judge noted that Polk s claims of ineffecfive assistance as to the failure to object to the sentencing instructions and failure to object to the prosecutor\u2019s improper comments failed because those underlying claims failed on the merits. As to Polk\u2019s ineffective assistance claim relating to trial counsel\u2019s failure to impeach a witness with his grand jury testimony, the magistrate &amp; J <em>J b </em>judge concluded that in light of the eviJ &amp; dence presented at trial, Polk could not , \u201e demonstrate any prejudice flowing from this error. The district court adopted the Report and Recommendation and dismissed Polk\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"A0q\">To be entitled to a COA, Polk must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). To make the requisite showing, he must demonstrate \u201cthat reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029,154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003) (quotations omitted). In evaluating whether Polk has satisfied his burden, this court undertakes \u201ca preliminary, though not defbiitive, consideration of the [legal] framework\u201d applicable to each of his claims. <em>Id. </em>at 338, 123 S.Ct. 1029. Although Polk need not demonstrate his appeal will succeed to be entitled to a COA, he must \u201cprove something more than the absence 0f frivolity or the existence of mere good faith.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"AQbb\">Having reviewed Polk\u2019s application for a COA and appellate filings,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> the magistrate judge\u2019s Report and Recommendation, the district court\u2019s Order, and the entire record before this court pursuant to the framework set out by the Supreme Court in <em>Miller-El, </em>this court concludes polk is not entitled to a COA The district court.s resolution of Polk\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition is not reasonably subject to debate and the issues Polk seeks to raige on appeal are not adequate to deserve further proceedings in particular, we note that we have the nothing to add to the magistrate judge's exceedingly well-stated Report and Recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"ADDb\">Accordingly, for those reasons set out in the magistrate judge\u2019s report and reeommendation and the district court\u2019s Order, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"776\">*776</page-number>this court DENIES Polk\u2019s request for a COA and DISMISSES this appeal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"ATVN\">.
