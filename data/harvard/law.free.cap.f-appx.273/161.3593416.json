First, he argues that the District Court sentenced him in violation of the Ex Post Facto and Due Process Clauses of the United States Constitution. Second, he contends that the District Court improperly applied a preponderance of the evidence standard in determining the applicability of certain Sentencing Guidelines enhancements. Third, he challenges the reasonableness of the sentence the District Court imposed on him. Because the parties and the District Court are familiar with the operative facts of this case, we offer only an abbreviated recitation to explain why we will affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b188-13\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-14\">On November 17, 2001, Pennsylvania State Police effected a traffic stop of a Toyota Corolla and discovered crack cocaine in the stopped vehicle. Through subsequent investigation, the State Police learned that the occupants of the vehicle were bound for Altoona, Pennsylvania, and that the drugs were being transported at the behest of Figaro. According to the testimony at trial, this was one of many trips of its kind associated with Figaro\u2019s management of a significant operation involving transportation of drugs from New York and Connecticut for distribution in Altoona, and guns and ammunition from Altoona to Connecticut.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-15\">On September 4, 2002, a jury convicted Figaro of (1) conspiracy to distribute in excess of 50 grams of cocaine base and in excess of 100 grams of heroin, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 846; (2) possession with intent to distribute in excess of 50 grams of cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2; and (3) conspiracy to commit money laundering, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1956(h). In rendering its verdict, the jury specifically found that Figaro had conspired to distribute and did distribute 50 grams or more of cocaine base and 100 grams or more of heroin. On September 29, 2003, the District Court sentenced Figaro to life imprisonment, a five-year term of supervised release, and a special assessment of $300.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-16\">After Figaro filed a timely notice of appeal, this Court affirmed the judgment of conviction but remanded the case for re-sentencing in light of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). On July 6, 2005, the District Court re-sentenced Figaro to 25 years of incarceration on both the drug conspiracy and distribution counts and to 20 years of incarceration on the money <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>laundering conspiracy count, all to run concurrently. On July 7, 2005, Figaro again filed a timely notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">Figaro\u2019s primary argument on appeal is that the application of the advisory Sentencing Guidelines is impermissible because applying <em>Booker</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>s remedial holding retroactively increases his punishment in violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause and Due Process notice requirements.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In <em>United States v. Pennavaria, </em>445 F.3d 720, 723-24 (3d Cir.2006), we held that applying <em>Booker\u2019s </em>remedial holding to defendants such as Figaro does not violate Ex Post Facto or Due Process Clause principles. We see no reason to revisit that holding and therefore conclude that the District Court\u2019s application of the advisory Sentencing Guidelines at re-sentencing did not violate the Ex Post Facto or Due Process Clauses of the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">Figaro also contends the District Court improperly applied a preponderance of the evidence standard in determining the applicability of certain Sentencing Guidelines enhancements. This claim is without merit. As we stated in <em>United States v. Grier, </em>475 F.3d 556 (3d Cir.2007) (en banc), \u201cthe right to proof beyond a reasonable doubt attaches only when the facts at issue have the effect of increasing the maximum punishment to which the defendant is exposed.\u201d <em>Grier, </em>475 F.3d at 565. In light of <em>Booker\u2019s </em>remedial holding, factual determinations related to the Sentencing Guidelines do not have such an effect. Accordingly, a preponderance of the evidence standard properly applies to factual determinations relevant to the now-advisory Sentencing Guidelines. <em>Id. </em>at 566.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-11\">Finally, Figaro challenges the reasonableness of his sentence. In <em>United States v. Booker, </em>the Supreme Court held that mandatory application of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines was unconstitutional. 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). Under the resulting advisory-guidelines regime, district courts enjoy significant latitude in imposing criminal sentences. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2465, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007); <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). <em>Post-Booker, </em>appellate review is limited to reviewing the trial court\u2019s sentence for \u201creasonableness.\u201d <em>United States v. Cooper, </em>437 F.3d 324, 327 (3d Cir.2006). The reasonableness standard of appellate review is akin to abuse of discretion. <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 594 (\u201cOur explanation of \u2018reasonableness\u2019 review in the <em>Booker </em>opinion made it pellucidly clear that the familiar abuse-of-discretion standard of review now applies to appellate review of sentencing decisions.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b189-16\">In conducting a reasonableness review, we must ensure that the sentencing court gave \u201cmeaningful consideration\u201d to the sentencing factors articulated in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and \u201creasonably applied them to the circumstances of the case.\u201d <em>Cooper, </em>437 F.3d at 330. It is therefore vital that the district court \u201cstate adequate reasons for a sentence on the record so that this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>court can engage in meaningful appellate review.\u201d <em>United States v. King, </em>454 F.3d 187, 196-97 (3d Cir.2006). Here, the record shows that the District Judge reviewed each of the applicable \u00a7 3553(a) factors and provided a detailed statement of his reasons for imposing a significantly below-guidelines sentence. Accordingly, we are well satisfied that Figaro\u2019s sentence is reasonable and will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b188-11\">. The District Court exercised jurisdiction pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231. We exercise jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b189-8\">. As we have previously noted, the Ex Post Facto Clause does not apply to judicial decisions. <em>United States v. Pennavaria, </em>445 F.3d 720, 723-24 (3d Cir.2006). However, \"limitations on <em>ex post facto </em>judicial decision-making are inherent in the notion of due process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b189-17\">.
