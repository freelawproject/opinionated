Following our review of the three cases the district court listed as strikes, <em>see Owens v. Isaac, </em>487 F.3d 561, 563 (8th Cir.2007) (per curiam) (reviewing de novo district court\u2019s interpretation and application of \u00a7 1915(g)), we conclude that two of them did not count as strikes within the meaning of section 1915(g), <em>cf. Newingham v. Westbrook, </em>140 Fed.Appx. 634, 634 (8th Cir.2005) (unpublished per curiam) (clarifying that dismissal of Arkansas inmate\u2019s civil rights action for failure to exhaust administrative remedies did not count as \u201cstrike\u201d within meaning of \u00a7 1915(g)); <em>Williams v. Lehman, </em>111 Fed. Appx. 852, 852 (8th Cir.2004) (unpublished per curiam) (case resolved though summary judgment did not constitute \u201cstrike\u201d). Accordingly, we grant Turner\u2019s motion to appeal IFP, deny his motion for counsel, reverse the district court\u2019s order denying him IFP status based on section 1915(g), and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
