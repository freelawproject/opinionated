The motion is filed pursuant to <em>United States v. Hahn, </em>359 F.3d 1315 (10th Cir.2004) (en banc). Defendant\u2019s counsel filed a response to the motion to enforce stating his belief that there are no meritorious grounds upon which defendant can urge denial of the government\u2019s motion to enforce the appeal waiver, and he requested permission to withdraw. <em>See Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967) (authorizing counsel to request permission to withdraw where counsel conscientiously examines a case and determines that an appeal would be wholly frivolous). This court then gave defendant an opportunity to file a pro se response to the government\u2019s <em>Hahn </em>motion. In response, defendant filed a request to withdraw his appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-22\">Accordingly, the government\u2019s motion is GRANTED, the appeal is DISMISSED, and defense counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b777-16\"> This panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
