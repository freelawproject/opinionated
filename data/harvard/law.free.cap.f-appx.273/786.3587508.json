Mr. Lockridge\u2019s claims arose out of the City\u2019s denial of his applications for permission to erect nine commercial billboards. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">Since 1951, the City of Oldsmar, Florida has banned commercial billboards. In 2003, when Mr. Loekridge submitted his applications, the City\u2019s Land Development Code expressly prohibited billboard signs. <em>See </em>City of Oldsmar Land Development Code Article 13 (\u201cSign Ordinance\u201d) \u00a7 13.3.3(3).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The City denied Mr. Lock-ridge\u2019s applications pursuant to Section 13.3.3(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-6\">Mr. Lockridge\u2019s June 13, 2003 complaint alleged that several sections of the Sign Ordinance, including Section 13.3.3(3), constituted content-based restrictions on speech. He also alleged that the Sign Ordinance \u201cvests impermissible discretion in government officials,\u201d and \u201cfavor[s] commercial speech over noncommercial speech.\u201d The complaint sought invalidation of the Sign Ordinance in its entirety. The complaint also requested injunctive relief, and an award of damages pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\">On September 27, 2005, the District Court granted Mr. Lockridge\u2019s partial motion for summary judgment, and denied the City\u2019s motion for summary judgment. The District Court concluded that Mr. Loekridge had standing to: (1) challenge Section 13.3.3(3) of the Sign Ordinance, and (2) assert a facial challenge to the entire ordinance. Although the District Court concluded that Mr. Loekridge could not assert a claim for injunctive relief,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> it found that the Sign Ordinance was unconstitutionally content-based, and that as a result, Mr. Loekridge was entitled to damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-13\">On reconsideration, the District Court denied Mr. Lockridge\u2019s motion, and granted the City\u2019s. The District Court concluded that this Circuit\u2019s decision in <em>CAMP Legal Defense Fund v. City of Atlanta, </em>451 F.3d 1257 (11th Cir.2006) required a finding that Mr. Loekridge only had standing to challenge Section 13.3.3(3) of the ordinance, and that he could not assert a facial challenge to the Sign Ordinance in its entirety. The District Court concluded that Section 13.3.3(3) was constitutional; that finding precluded Mr. Lockridge\u2019s damages claim. The District Court left intact its finding that Mr. Loekridge could not assert a claim for injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-14\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b813-15\">Both summary judgment rulings and standing determinations are reviewed <em>de novo. Bochese v. Town of Ponce Inlet, </em>405 F.3d 964, 975 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b813-16\">Mr. Loekridge raises three arguments on appeal. First, he contends that the District Court erred in concluding that Section 13.3.3(3) was constitutional. Next, he argues that the District Court erred in concluding that he lacked standing to assert a facial challenge to the Sign Ordinance as a whole. Third, he contends that the District Court erred in concluding that his could not assert a claim for injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-17\">The City contends that none of Mr. Lockridge\u2019s arguments require reversal. Additionally, it contends that Mr. Lock-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"788\">*788</page-number>ridge lacks standing to challenge the allegedly unconstitutional portions of the Sign Ordinance because his alleged injury is not redressible. In particular, it argues that the signs Mr. Lockridge sought to erect violated the City\u2019s applicable height and size regulations, which Mr. Lockridge did not expressly challenge. That is, even if the provisions Mr. Lockridge did challenge were stricken, he would still be unable to erect his billboards because the height and size regulations would remain in place.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-4\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">Article III standing requires that a plaintiff suffer an injury in fact that is both causally connected to the conduct complained of and redressible by a favorable decision of the court. <em>Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, </em>504 U.S. 555, 560-61, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992). An injury suffered as a result of an unconstitutional sign regulation is not redressible if the plaintiffs sign applications could be denied on the basis of \u201cthe requirements of other ... regulations not challenged.\u201d <em>KH Outdoor, L.L.C. v. Clay County, </em>482 F.3d 1299, 1303 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b814-10\">Mr. Lockridge\u2019s complaint does not challenge those portions of the City\u2019s sign regulations that establish height and size limitations for signs in industrial and commercial zones.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Mr. Lockridge sought to erect signs in those zones; therefore, his signs would necessarily have to conform to those zones\u2019 applicable height and size regulations. All of Mr. Lockridge\u2019s proposed structures exceeded the maximum height and size limits for signs in industrial and commercial zones. Decl. of Bruce Haddock <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> at 7-9 (App. 8 to the City\u2019s Mot. for Summ. J.). Invalidation of Section 13.3.3(3) would not redress Mr. Lock-ridge\u2019s injury because the City could still deny his applications on an alternative, unchallenged ground. As a result, Mr. Lockridge has not satisfied the redressability requirement.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b815-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"789\">*789</page-number>Mr. Lockridge does not contend that the billboards he sought to erect complied with the City\u2019s size and height regulations. Rather, he argues that the City cannot raise a height and size-related standing challenge for the first time on appeal. However, whether this argument was raised below is immaterial. Standing is \u201c \u2018perhaps the most important\u2019 jurisdictional doctrine.\u201d <em>Bochese, </em>405 F.3d at 974 (citation omitted). It is a jurisdictional requirement that \u201c \u2018involves the court\u2019s competency to consider a given type of case,\u2019 \u201d and therefore \u201c \u2018cannot be waived or otherwise conferred upon the court by the parties.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 975 (citation omitted). \u201c[W]e are obliged to consider questions of standing regardless of whether the parties have raised them.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b815-5\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b815-6\">Mr. Lockridge also contends that the City\u2019s standing requirement arguments are \u201cpost-hoc rationalizations.\u201d To the extent that this argument asserts that the City cannot challenge standing based on grounds not raised in its initial denials of Mr. Lockridge\u2019s applications, we reject it.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-7\"><em>KH Outdoor </em>is again on point. There, the plaintiff submitted building applications that were rejected because of a city ordinance that \u201cprohibited the erection of new billboards.\u201d <em>KH Outdoor, </em>482 F.3d at 1301. This Court found that the plaintiff lacked standing as a result of its failure to comply with certain Florida statutes. Although the city defendant did not initially cite to state statutes when it rejected the billboard applications, the parties\u2019 motions for summary addressed the statutes\u2019 applicability. <em>Id. </em>at 1301-04. This Court was persuaded that redressability was lacking because \u201ca favorable decision, that is, invalidation of the Old Sign Ordinance provisions KH Outdoor challenged, did not mean KH Outdoor would then receive approval of its sign permit applications, because Clay County <em>could </em>block the proposed signs by enforcing other state statutes and regulations not challenged.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1304 (emphasis added). Therefore, that the City did not deny Mr. Lockridge\u2019s applications on the basis of height and size is not dispositive. Because it could have, Mr. Lockridge\u2019s injuries are not redressible.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-10\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b815-11\">Because we conclude that Mr. Lockridge lacks standing, we cannot reach the merits of his constitutional challenge to Section 13.3.3(3). <em>See id. </em>at 1305 (\u201c[B]ecause we find KH Outdoor lacks constitutional standing, we cannot reach the merits of its challenges.\u201d); <em>Coral Springs St. Sys. v. City of Sunrise, </em>371 F.3d 1320, 1347 (11th Cir.2004) (explaining that our pronouncements on allegedly unconstitutional aspects of a sign code would be \u201cessentially advisory in nature\u201d when \u201cthe result of th[e] inquiry could have no effect on the result\u201d).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b815-12\">We AFFIRM the District Court\u2019s summary judgment in favor of the City of Oldsmar.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b813-8\">. Article 13 contains the City\u2019s sign regulations.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b813-9\">. The ordinance in effect at the time Mr. Loekridge filed his permit applications was repealed and amended on June 15, 2004, before the District Court heard the parties' motions for summary judgment. Mr. Lock-ridge's complaint challenged only the version of the ordinance in effect at the time his applications were denied.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b814-6\">. The <em>KH Outdoor </em>redressability analysis defeats claims like the ones brought in this case if a city could deny a billboard application on an alternative provision of its sign ordinance which the plaintiff's complaint does not challenge. An unchallenged provision cannot be said to cause an alleged injury. Here, Mr. Lockridge\u2019s complaint sought invalidation of the Sign Ordinance in its entirety. However, we will not conclude that he challenged every one of its sections, including those pertaining to height and size restrictions. Mr. Lockridge challenged the ordinance as a whole because he assumed that the constitutionally invalid portions were \"inseparable\u201d from the constitutional parts. <em>See, e.g., Complaint </em>at 24. This assumption was erroneous. <em>See </em>Sign Ordinance \u00a7 13.7.1.2. (\"If any section ... is for any reason held to be invalid or unconstitutional ... such decision shall not effect the validity of the remaining portions of this Article or the Land Development Code.\u201d). Mr. Lockridge\u2019s injury was caused by sections of the Sign Ordinance he challenged expressly, not those he happened to challenge as a result of an inaccurate severability contention.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b814-11\">. At the time Mr. Lockridge's complaint was filed, Haddock served as the City's City Manager.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b814-12\">. This approach is one endorsed by at least two of our Sister Circuits. <em>See, e.g., Midwest Media Prop., LLC v. Symmes Twp., </em>503 F.3d 456, 464 (6th Cir.2007) (finding that \"[a]ll of the signs plaintiffs sought to erect violated Symmes Township\u2019s size and height requirements, and they have not provided us with any facts showing that they intend to display signs that comply with these provisions;\u201d as a result, plaintiffs have suffered no cognizable injury, and \u201clack standing to mount an attack on the township's sign regulations\u2014whether under the overbreadth doctrine or under any other doctrine\u201d); <em>Get Outdoors II, LLC v. City of San Diego, </em>506 F.3d 886, 893 (9th Cir. 2007) (endorsing our approach in <em>KH Outdoor, </em>so long as standing is defeated as a result of an <em>unchallenged </em>secondary restriction, such as one based on height or size).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b815-8\">. Mr. Lockridge raises an overbreadth argument. However, this strategy does not overcome his failure to satisfy all constitutional standing requirements. <em>See CAMP Legal Def. Fund, Inc., </em>451 F.3d at 1270 (explaining that overbreadth \"is an exception to the prudential standing prohibition against <em>jus tertii </em>claims,\" but not the constitutional standing requirements).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
