Chiquito\u2019s pro se requests for a certifi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>cate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) and to proceed on appeal <em>in forma pauperis. </em>Chiquito seeks a COA so he can appeal the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1)(B). We grant Chiquito\u2019s request to proceed on appeal <em>in forma pauperis. </em>Nevertheless, because Chiquito has not \u201cmade a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 2253(c)(2), this court denies his request for a COA and dismisses this aPPeal-</p>\n<p id=\"AJFZ-\">Because the procedural history of this case is set out in this court\u2019s opinion on direct appeal affirming Chiquito\u2019s convictions, it need not be repeated here. <em>United States v. Chiquito, </em>175 Fed.Appx. 215, 216-17 (10th Cir.2006). In the instant \u00a7 2255 motion, Chiquito alleged as follows: (1) his convictions violate the Fifth Amendment\u2019s prohibition against double jeopardy; (2) the trial court erred in refusing to strike certain paragraphs from the presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d); and (3) trial and appellate counsel were ineffective for failing to raise the previous two issues. Chiquito\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion was referred to a magistrate judge for initial proceedings pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"AKu\">The magistrate judge issued a Report and RecommendatL, recommending that Chiquito\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion be denied. As to Chiquito\u2019s double jeopardy claim, the magistrate judge noted he had previous<em>l</em>y raised such a claim on direct appeal. <em>Cmquito, </em>175 Fed.Appx. at 219. Accordingly, he could not relitigate the claim. <em>United States v. Prichard, </em>875 F.2d 789, 790-91 (10th Cir.1989). To the extent he was asserting new grounds in support of his double jeopardy claim, the district court concluded the claim was procedurally defaulted because those grounds were not raised on direct appeal and Chiquito failed to make the necessary showing to overcome his procedural default. <em>United States v. Cox, </em>83 F.3d 336, 341 (10th Cir. 1996). The magistrate judge concluded Chiquito\u2019s sentencing claim was also procedurally defaulted because it was not raised on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"AoK\">Nevertheless, to resolve Chiquito\u2019s daims of ineffective assistance, the district court considered on the merits the defaulted claims. See <em>United States v.Cook, </em>45 F.3d 388, 392 (10th Cir.1995). Applying test set 0ut jn <em>Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 304, 52 S.Ct. 180, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932), the magistrate judge concluded Chiquito\u2019s double jeopardy claim failed because each of the offenses for which he was convicted required proof of a different element. Accordingly, counsel was not ineffective for failing to raise the issue on appeal. The magistrate likewise concluded Chiquito\u2019s counsel was not ineffective for failing to object to certain paragraphs in the PSR. A review of the sentencing transcript revealed the trial court had not, in arriving at a sentence, relied on any of the information in the paragraphs identified by Chiquito. Thus, Chiquito could not demonstrate any prejudice flowing from counsel\u2019s failure to raise the issue and his claim of ineffective assistance failed' <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 59, 106 S.Ct. 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985)(holding that to Prevail on a claim of ineffective assistance, a movant must demonstrate both that his counsels performance was deficient and that the deficient performance Prejudiced him).Upon novo review the district court adopted the Report and Recommendation and denied Chiquitos \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"A2O\">The granting of a COA is a jurisdictional prerequisite to Chiquito\u2019s appeal from the dismissal of his \u00a7 2255 petition, <em>Miller-El v. Cockrell, </em>537 U.S. 322, 336, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 154 L.Ed.2d 931 (2003). To be entitled to a COA, Chiquito must make \u201ca substantial showing of the denial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"773\">*773</page-number>of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). To make the requisite showing, he must demonstrate \u201creasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quotations omitted). In evaluating whether Chiquito has satisfied his burden, this court undertakes \u201ca preliminary, though not definitive, consideration of the [legal] framework\u201d applicable to each of his claims. <em>Id. </em>at 338, 123 S.Ct. 1029. Although Chiquito need not demonstrate his appeal will succeed to be entitled to a COA, he must \u201cprove something more than the absence of frivolity or the existence of mere good faith.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">Having undertaken a review of Chiquito\u2019s appellate filings, the district court\u2019s Order, the magistrate judge\u2019s Report and Recommendation, and the entire record before this court pursuant to the framework set out by the Supreme Court in <em>Miller-El, </em>we conclude Chiquito is not entitled to a COA. The district court\u2019s resolution of Chiquito\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion is not reasonably subject to debate and the issues he seeks to raise on appeal are not adequate to deserve further proceedings. Accordingly, this court DENIES Chiquito\u2019s request for a COA and DISMISSES this appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
