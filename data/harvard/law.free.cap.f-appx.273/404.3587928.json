The sentence imposed exceeded the advisory guidelines range as calculated in the PSR. However, the record is unclear whether the sentence was the result of an upward departure authorized by the Guidelines or whether it was the result of a variance and thus was a non-guidelines sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">Although the memorandum ruling states that the sentence was a non-guidelines sentence and did not result from an upward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3, it simultaneously cites \u00a7 4A1.3 in support of the purported variance. Additionally, as Henderson points out, the Statement of Reasons indicates that the sentence was the result of a guidelines upward departure, specifically citing U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 4A1.3, 5K2.0, and 5K2.21. The oral pronouncement provides little guidance in resolving the conflict.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">Because resolution of the question is a necessary precursor to applying the appropriate standard of review, we order a LIMITED REMAND to the district court for the sole purpose of clarifying whether the sentence resulted from an upward departure pursuant to \u00a7\u00a7 4A1.3, 5K2.0 and 5K2.21 or whether it resulted from a non-guidelines variance. Once the district court issues such clarification, the case shall be returned to this court for further proceedings. This court retains jurisdiction over this case for all other purposes.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b431-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
