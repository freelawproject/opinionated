Hargrove appeals his sentence, contending that the district court erred in not considering the inherent inequity of the 100:1 ratio for crack and powder cocaine offenses as the basis for a variance in his case, and that his sentence is consequently unreasonable. We vacate Hargrove\u2019s sentence and remand for re-sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-11\">At sentencing, Hargrove requested a variance based on the sentencing disparity for crack and powder cocaine offenses, but acknowledged our decision in <em>United States v. Kimbrough, </em>174 Fed.Appx. 798 (4th Cir.2006) (unpublished) (vacating sentence because the district court deviated from the Guidelines range based on the sentencing disparity for crack and powder cocaine offenses). The district court declined to impose a variance sentence, explicitly relying on <em>United States v. Eura, </em>440 F.3d 625, 634 (4th Cir.2006) (holding that the 100:1 ratio may not be used as a basis for a variance sentence). After Hargrove\u2019s brief was filed, however, the Supreme Court reversed this court\u2019s <em>Kimbrough </em>decision and held that \u201cit would not be an abuse of discretion for a district court to conclude when sentencing a particular defendant that the crack/powder disparity yields a sentence \u2018greater than necessary\u2019 to achieve \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s purposes, even in a mine-run case.\u201d <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 575, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007). As acknowledged by the Government, the district court did not have the benefit of the Supreme Court\u2019s <em>Kimbrough </em>decision in deciding not to vary below Hargrove\u2019s Guidelines range.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-17\">Accordingly, we vacate Hargrove\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing in light of <em>Kimbrough.</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark><em> </em>We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b267-18\">\n<em>VACATED AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b267-12\"> On remand, the amended Guidelines for crack cocaine offenses, effective November 1, 2007, will apply.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
