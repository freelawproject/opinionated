Ashcroft, </em>379 F.3d 876, 884 (9th Cir.2004), and grant the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"586\">*586</page-number>Initially, we note that, as grounds for his adverse credibility finding, the IJ pointed to several minor evidentiary discrepancies which the Government has not addressed or attempted to defend. To the degree these discrepancies exist, none provides a legitimate basis for an adverse credibility finding. At best, any inconsistencies in Golkar\u2019s account of his resistance to enforced daily prayer at his workplace in the early 1980s are minor and do not go to the heart of Golkar\u2019s claim that he has a well-founded fear of persecution based on his conversion to Christianity in the 1990s. <em>See id. </em>at 884-85. Similarly, the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Golkar would likely have had difficulty finding other work after being fired from that job in the 1980s, or that Golkar\u2019s wife would likely have reported his conversion to Christianity immediately upon their divorce, has no apparent basis in the record. <em>See, e.g., Shah v. INS, </em>220 F.3d 1062, 1071 (9th Cir.2000) (\u201cSpeculation and conjecture cannot form the basis of an adverse credibility finding____\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-4\">The Government defends the adverse credibility finding on the basis of the IJ\u2019s determination that Golkar \u201cdidn\u2019t explain his inability to know basic facts regarding the Christian faith.\u201d But this finding is also not grounded in substantial record evidence under our case law. Golkar\u2019s sworn testimony at the hearing offered a coherent, detailed and consistent account of his gradual attraction to Christianity, his personal conversion experience, and his baptism at a Tehran church. The IJ\u2019s decision did not call into question, or even mention, this testimony. Rather, the IJ based his adverse credibility finding solely on inconsistent statements contained in the Assessment to Refer.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Assessment to Refer, however, does not constitute substantial evidence to support an adverse credibility finding, because it suffers from the same defects in reliability as the Assessment to Refer rejected in <em>Singh v. Gonzales, </em>403 F.3d 1081 (9th Cir.2005). <em>See id. </em>at 1087-90 (holding that \u201cthe asylum officer\u2019s Assessment To Refer [wa]s not sufficient evidence of what Singh said to permit evaluation of an asserted conflict\u201d with Singh\u2019s later testimony where the Assessment to Refer, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cd[id] not contain any record of the questions and answers at the asylum interview, or other detailed, contemporary, chronological notes of the interview, but only a short, conclusory summary \u2014 essentially, an opinion\u201d). Moreover, none of the \u201cindicia of reliability\u201d which might have led to a different result in <em>Singh </em>are present in this case. <em>Cf. id. </em>at 1089 (suggesting that an Assessment to Refer might be rendered relevant for impeachment where, for example, the asylum officer testifies at the hearing before the IJ or submits an affidavit, or the Service establishes that procedures were in place to ensure accurate translation at the interview).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b612-8\">\u201c[U]nder these circumstances, the Assessment To Refer, standing alone, is not substantial record evidence\u201d to undermine <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"587\">*587</page-number>Golkar\u2019s otherwise credible testimony. <em>Id. </em>at 1090. Because the IJ did not otherwise question Golkar\u2019s testimony about his conversion and baptism, but merely relied on the Assessment to Refer, this ground for the adverse credibility finding was not supported by substantial evidence.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">Because the adverse credibility finding was not supported by substantial evidence, we grant the petition for review. We vacate the decision of the BIA and remand with instructions that the BIA accept Golkar\u2019s testimony as credible and on that basis determine whether Golkar is entitled to withholding of removal and/or protection under Article 8 of the Convention Against Torture and whether asylum is to be granted as an exercise of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">PETITION GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b611-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b611-25\">. We have jurisdiction to review final BIA orders under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a). Because the BIA adopted the IJ\u2019s decision in full and cited <em>Matter of Burbano, </em>20 I. &amp; N. Dec. 872 (BIA 1994), \"we review the IJ\u2019s decision as if it were the BIA's.\" <em>Moreno-Morante v. Gonzales, </em>490 F.3d 1172, 1174 (9th Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b612-5\">. The Assessment to Refer is a document prepared by an asylum officer who \"meets informally with the applicant, considers the documents presented with the asylum application, then decides whether asylum should be granted or whether the matter should be referred to an IJ for formal adjudication.\u201d <em>Singh v. Gonzales, </em>403 F.3d 1081, 1087 (9th Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b612-9\">. Because the Assessment to Refer is thus unreliable for impeachment under <em>Singh, </em>we need not address whether any or all of the asylum officer\u2019s questions (e.g., the chapter and verse in the Bible where the Lord\u2019s Prayer appears; how many chapters are in the Bible; the content of Psalm 23) constituted \"an impermissible governmental inquiry into religious dogma and practice.\u201d <em>Mejia-Paiz v. INS, </em>111 F.3d 720, 727-29 (9th Cir.1997) (Ferguson, J., dissenting).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b613-11\">. The Government argues that Golkar should have corroborated his account of his conversion, but absent a legitimate reason to doubt Golkar\u2019s \"direct and specific\u201d testimony about his conversion, corroborating evidence is not required. <em>Kaur, </em>379 F.3d at 889-90.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b613-7\">RAWLINSON, Circuit Judge, dissenting:</author>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">I respectfully dissent. In my view, we are not compelled to find that the Immigration Judge\u2019s (IJ) adverse credibility determination was erroneous. <em>See Mansour v. Ashcroft, </em>390 F.3d 667, 671 (9th Cir. 2004) (holding that contrary determination must be compelled to reverse the IJ).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-9\">If even one of the bases supporting the adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence, the petition for review must be denied. <em>See Li v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 959, 964 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-10\">In this case, the one basis supporting the adverse credibility determination is Ahmadrez Golkar\u2019s lack of knowledge regarding baptism, a basic Christian foundational ritual that he professed to have undergone. The majority disposition grants the petition primarily because of its conelusion that the Assessment To Refer in this case was unreliable. However, unlike the Assessment To Refer discussed in <em>Singh v. Gonzales, </em>403 F.3d 1081 (9th Cir. 2005), the record does not reflect that the Assessment To Refer in this case suffered from the same deficiencies as noted in <em>Singh. See e.g. Singh, </em>403 F.3d at 1088-89 (noting the apparent lack of a translator).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-14\">Because the adverse credibility determination was supported by substantial evidence, I would deny the petition.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
