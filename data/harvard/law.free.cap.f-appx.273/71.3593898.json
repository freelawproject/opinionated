Aug. 10, 2007). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-21\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>See Kam v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir. 2005) (per curiam). An abuse of discretion may be found where the BIA\u2019s decision \u201cprovides no rational explanation, inexplicably departs from established policies, is devoid of any reasoning, or contains only summary or eonclusory statements; that is to say, where the Board has acted in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 233-34.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-22\">As an initial matter, we deem abandoned any challenge to the agency\u2019s denial of Jiang\u2019s motion to file a successive asylum application, as he has failed to raise that claim in his brief to this Court. <em>See Yueq</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number><em>ing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 541 n. 1, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\">Moreover, we conclude that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Jiang\u2019s motion to reopen. As the BIA noted, this motion was untimely because the agency issued a final order in July 1992, and Jiang did not file his motion to reopen until July 2006, well beyond the 90-day deadline. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). The BIA properly found that Jiang\u2019s motion did not qualify for the changed circumstances exception to the time limitation applicable to motions to reopen and Jiang fails to raise a material challenge to this finding in his brief to this Court. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">Instead, Jiang\u2019s brief to this Court argues that the BIA abused its discretion by failing to consider the documents at issue in <em>Shou Yung Guo v. Gonzales, </em>463 F.3d 109 (2d Cir.2006). However, it is undisputed that Jiang did not submit these documents to the Immigration Judge with his motion to reopen, or on appeal to the BIA. Thus, the BIA did not abuse its discretion by failing to consider documents that were never properly part of the administrative record. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(d)(iv).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
