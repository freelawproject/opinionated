He was sentenced in 1994 to 250 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"404\">*404</page-number>After filing several meritless postconviction motions in the court of conviction and the district court for the district in which he was incarcerated, Williams filed in the court of conviction a purported Rule 35 motion seeking a reduction in his sentence. The version of Rule 35 that was in effect when Williams was convicted and sentenced provided that a district court could (a) correct a sentence on remand, (b) reduce a sentence on the motion of the Government, or (c) \u201ccorrect a sentence that was imposed as a result of arithmetical, technical, or other clear error\u201d if it acted within seven days after imposing the sentence. Fed. R.Crim. P. 35(a)-(c) (West 1994). Williams\u2019s motion met none of these conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">A defendant\u2019s motion cannot be considered a Rule 35 motion to correct or reduce his sentence when his motion and situation do not fit any provision of that Rule. <em>United States v. Early, </em>27 F.3d 140, 141 (5th Cir.1994). As Williams has already been denied relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, the district court would have lacked jurisdiction to reduce Williams sentence under either Rule 35 or \u00a7 2255. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2255; <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>26 F.3d 512, 518-19 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">The district court denied and dismissed Williams\u2019s motion with prejudice without mentioning jurisdiction; however, its dismissal was presumably on that ground. <em>See e.g., Saudi Arabia v. Nelson, </em>507 U.S. 349, 355-63, 113 S.Ct. 1471, 123 L.Ed.2d 47 (1993) (where the basis for jurisdiction is statutory, failure to meet the statutory criteria means that the court lacks jurisdiction). We affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">This court has already warned Williams that he may no longer file successive \u00a7 2255 motions that do not comport with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b). Williams is now cautioned that any future frivolous or repetitive filings in this court or any court subject to this court\u2019s jurisdiction will invite additional sanctions, including monetary penalties and limits on his access to federal court, as will the failure to withdraw any pending matters that are frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">AFFIRMED: SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b429-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
