This case pertains to a matter of contract interpretation in a lease agreement, namely whether the term \u201cPremises\u201d as used in a lease agreement is defined to include buildings and improvements on the land, for purposes of valuating the property. The district court ordered summary judgment for Carrols, finding that the term \u201cPremises\u201d did not include buildings and improvements on the property. For the reasons that follow, we REVERSE the district court order granting summary judgment for Carrols and REMAND the case to the district court with instructions to enter summary judgment for Cain.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-22\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b456-23\">Both Cain and Carrols are businesses engaged in the ownership and operation of Burger King Restaurants. In 1992, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>parties entered into lease agreements under which Cain leased Carrols various Burger King restaurants, including Store No. 4188, a Burger King restaurant in Jackson, Michigan. The lease agreement pertaining to Store No. 4188 has a twenty-year term, and includes an option to purchase that can be exercised after ten years from the start of the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">On September 20, 2004, Carrols exercised the option for Store No. 4188. In so doing, Carrols informed Cain that under its interpretation of the lease terms, the purchase price was dependent on the value of the property alone, and not the buildings and improvements on the property. Carrols contended that \u201cPremises\u201d as used in the valuation provision of the lease did not include \u201cBuilding,\u201d which the preamble to the lease defined as \u201call buildings, structures and other improvements whether now existing or hereafter erected thereon.\u201d Carrols further contended that because the purchase option gave Carrols the right to purchase the \u201cPremises\u201d free of all liens and encumbrances, it would acquire title to the land as well as the buildings and improvements upon exercise of the purchase option. So under its interpretation of lease provisions, Carrols would pay only the value of the land, without account for the value of buildings or other improvements, but would acquire title to both the land and the buildings.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">On October 1, 2004, Cain responded by seeking a judicial declaration in Michigan state court that under the lease terms, the purchase price should be determined by the fair market value of the land and buildings and improvements on the property. Carrols removed the case to federal court and filed an answer to Cain\u2019s complaint while asserting two counterclaims. The first counterclaim sought declaratory and injunctive relief that Cain is contractually required to participate in the appraisal process. The second counterclaim sought a declaratory judgment that the fair market value of Store No. 4188 should be based on the value of the land only as measured against comparable properties, and not the value of the land and all buildings, structures, and improvements thereon; or alternatively that the fair market value is based on the value of the land and buildings, but must be adjusted to account for Carrols\u2019s improvements to the property.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">Both parties moved for summary judgment. On October 24, 2005, the magistrate judge filed a report and recommendation regarding the parties\u2019 motions for summary judgment, recommending that both parties\u2019 motions be denied. The magistrate judge found the term \u201cPremises\u201d ambiguous, and that the existence of a genuine issue of material fact precluded summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-9\">On March 27, 2006, 2006 WL 770429, the district court issued an order: (1) rejecting the magistrate judge\u2019s finding that the term \u201cPremises\u201d is ambiguous; (2) denying Cain\u2019s motion for summary judgment and granting Carrols\u2019s motion for summary judgment; (8) dismissing Cain\u2019s complaint; and (4) entering judgment in favor of Carrols on its counterclaim against Cain, declaring that \u201cthe term \u2018Premises\u2019 means the premises located at 1023 N. West Avenue, Jackson, MI 49202 and being more particularly described on Schedule A.\u201d Cain timely appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-10\">II. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b457-11\">Cain appeals the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment for Carrols. We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo. <em>Miller v. Admin. Office of the Courts, </em>448 F.3d 887, 893 (6th Cir .2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b457-12\">The parties agree that the substantive law of Michigan applies in this diversity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>case. <em>Klaxon v. Stentor Elec. Mfg. Co., </em>313 U.S. 487, 497, 61 S.Ct. 1020, 85 L.Ed. 1477 (1941); <em>Hisrich v. Volvo Cars of N. Am., Inc., </em>226 F.3d 445, 449 (6th Cir.2000). We follow and apply Michigan law in accordance with the controlling decisions of the Supreme Court of Michigan. <em>Detroit Edison Co. v. NABCO, Inc., </em>35 F.3d 236, 239 (6th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">Two provisions of the lease agreement form the basis for the disagreement in this case. The first provision is the preamble, which contains the only definitions in the lease agreement for the terms \u201cPremises\u201d and \u201cBuilding.\u201d The preamble provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"At5\">[Cain] ... does hereby lease ... the following described premises (hereinafter the \u201cPremises\u201d) located at 1023 N. West Avenue, Jackson, MI 49202 and being more particularly described on Schedule A,...; together with all buildings, structures and other improvements whether now existing or hereafter erected thereon (hereinafter collectively the \u201cBuilding\u201d) and all easements, rights of way, licenses and appurtenances thereto, and together with all rights and privileges in and about the Premises as may be necessary or convenient to the operations of [Carrols]\u2019s business at the Premises for the term and upon the conditions hereinafter set forth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Schedule A, in turn, is a metes and bounds description of the leased property.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">The second provision of importance is the purchase option (\u201cPurchase Option\u201d) in \u00a7 26, which contains the term \u201cPremises,\u201d and provides that Carrols has the option of purchasing the \u201cPremises\u201d after ten years, and that its valuation will be the fair market value of the \u201cPremises\u201d:</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">(A) [Cain] hereby grants [Carrols] the option to purchase the Premises (the \u201cOption\u201d) on the terms and conditions set forth herein. [Carrols] may give [Cain] written notice (the \u201cOption Notice\u201d) of its exercise of the Option at any time during the Lease Term after the tenth (10th) anniversary of the Commencement Date (the \u201cOption Period\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">(C)(i) The price which [Carrols] agrees to pay, and which [Cain] agrees to accept for the Premises (hereinafter, the \u201cPurchase Price\u201d) shall be the \u201cFair Market Value\u201d (as hereinafter defined) of the Premises as of the date Lessee [exercises the option]. Fair Market Value of the Premises shall mean the value of the Premises as compared with sales of similar or comparable properties.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-10\">(C) The deed of conveyance shall be the usual bargain and sale deed ... so as to convey to [Carrols] good, marketable and insurable title to the Premises in fee simple free of all \u201cLiens\u201d....</p>\n<p id=\"b458-11\">(F) All fixtures and articles of personal property attached or appurtenant to the Premises except those leased or otherwise financed by [Carrols] are included in the transaction contemplated hereby, without additional consideration. Such fixtures and articles shall include without limitation all plumbing, heating and lighting fixtures, to the extent actually installed or contained in or used in connection with the Premises.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-12\">Both parties claim that the term \u201cPremises\u201d as used in the lease agreement is unambiguous, but they take opposing positions as to its meaning. Cain argues that the term \u201cPremises\u201d includes the term \u201cBuilding,\u201d relying on \u00a7 26, while Carrols argues that \u201cPremises\u201d excludes \u201cBuilding,\u201d relying on the preamble. The different definitions of \u201cPremises\u201d as urged by the parties yield drastically different valuations of the property. Carrols offered $400,000 as the purchase price for the land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>only, while Cain estimated that the value of the land with the buildings and other improvements is worth approximately $1.3 to $1.6 million.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">The district court found that the term \u201cPremises\u201d in the contract was not ambiguous, and held that the terms \u201cPremises\u201d and \u201cBuilding\u201d were separate terms, and that \u201cPremises\u201d did not include \u201cBuilding.\u201d In its analysis, the district court relied on the definitions of \u201cPremises\u201d and a \u201cBuilding\u201d in the preamble:</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">[Cain]\u2019s argument that the term \u201cPremises\u201d referred to both the land and all improvements located thereon, including the building, would mean that the Court must go beyond the definition set forth in the Lease. The Court notes that the terms \u201cPremises\u201d and \u201cBuilding\u201d are separated by a semicolon. A \u201c \u2018[s]emicolon\u2019 is defined as \u2018the punctuation mark\u2019 (;) used to indicate a major division in a sentence where a more distinct separation is felt between clauses or items on a list than is indicated by a comma, as between two clauses of a compound sentence.\u201d <em>People v. Beardsley, </em>263 Mich. App. 408, 688 N.W.2d 304, 306 (2004) (citing Random House Webster\u2019s College Dictionary 116 (1997)). The semicolon means that the parties intended to more clearly divide the term \u201cPremises\u201d from the term \u201cBuilding.\u201d If the Court were to interpret \u201cPremises\u201d to include \u201cBuilding,\u201d the Court would have to add the term \u201cinclude\u201d or \u201cincluding\u201d to the definition, which the Court cannot do since the terms are expressly defined in the lease.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">We disagree with the district court\u2019s conclusion that the term \u201cPremises\u201d unambiguously excludes buildings and improvements. As a preliminary matter, we decline to focus on punctuation, namely a semicolon in the preamble, as an indicator of the meaning of \u201cPremises.\u201d Punctuation as an aid in the interpretation of a contractual provision is disfavored when better means of gauging the intent of the parties exist. This Court has stated that \u201cpunctuation is not to be permitted to control meaning where the text is clear,\u201d and relevant only in the \u201ccase of ambiguity.\u201d <em>Travelers Indem. Co. v. Pray, </em>204 F.2d 821, 824 (6th Cir.1953). Indeed, the United States Supreme Court has long ago instructed that \u201c[pjunctuation is a most fallible standard by which to interpret a writing; it may be resorted to when all other means fail.\u201d <em>Ewing\u2019s Lessee v. Burnet, </em>36 U.S. 41, 54, 11 Pet. 41, 9 L.Ed. 624 (1837).</p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">In our interpretation of the meaning of \u201cPremises,\u201d we do not focus solely on the term\u2019s use in the preamble, in isolation from other lease provisions. Michigan rules of contract interpretation provide that \u201c[c]onflicts between clauses should be harmonized, and a contract should not be interpreted so as to render it unreasonable.\u201d <em>South Macomb Disposal Auth. v. Am. Ins. Co., </em>225 Mich.App. 635, 572 N.W.2d 686, 695 (1997). Rather than ascertaining the disputed term as it appears in the preamble, we \u201clook[ ] to the contract as a <em>whole </em>and give[] meaning to <em>all </em>its terms.\u201d <em>Auto-Owners Ins. Co. v. Harrington, </em>455 Mich. 377, 565 N.W.2d 839, 841 (1997) (emphases added). Thus, we cannot ignore the manner in which \u201cPremises\u201d is used in other parts of the lease. Michigan law of contract interpretation provides that \u201ccourts cannot simply ignore portions of a contract in order to avoid a finding of ambiguity or in order to declare an ambiguity. Instead, contracts must be construed so as to give effect to every word or phrase as far as practicable.\u201d <em>Klapp v. United Ins. Group Agency, Inc., </em>468 Mich. 459, 663 N.W.2d 447, 453 (2003) (citations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>In harmonizing the term \u201cPremises\u201d as used throughout the lease, we are also mindful that preambles in a contract generally serve to introduce the contract\u2019s subject matter rather than set forth the specific rights and obligations of the parties. <em>See </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 1214 (8th ed.2004) (defining \u201cpreamble\u201d as \u201c[a]n introductory statement ... explaining the document\u2019s basis and objective\u201d). In light of a preamble\u2019s purpose in a contract, we recognize that provisions in a preamble, like recitals or other prefatory provisions of a contract, do not necessarily control over provisions in the operative sections. <em>Cf. In re GGSI Liquidation Inc., </em>351 B.R. 529, 565 (Bankr.N.D.Ill.2006) (\u201cObligations and promises of parties in the operative portion of the contract prevail over a preliminary recital or preamble.\u201d); <em>Crowell v. Gould, </em>96 F.2d 569, 573 (D.C.Cir.1938) (\u201cWhere recitals contained in a contract are ambiguous and the operative part is free from doubt ... the operative part must prevail.\u201d); <em>Berg v. Berg, </em>201 Minn. 179, 275 N.W. 836, 842 (1937) (\u201c[I]n contracts where a preamble ... is ... declaratory of the purposes and intentions of the parties, it will be looked to in construing the contract ... but in no sense will it be the basis of a legal and binding obligation of the parties.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">We now proceed to assess the term \u201cPremises\u201d as used not only in the preamble, but also in the other provisions of the lease. We recognize that if \u201cPremises\u201d in the preamble is read in isolation from the term\u2019s use in other lease provisions, the terms \u201cPremises\u201d and \u201cBuilding\u201d can be interpreted as being distinct and mutually exclusive. The preamble states, after all, that Carrols \u201clease[s] ... the \u2018Premises\u2019 ... <em>together with ... </em>the \u2018Building.\u2019 \u201d <em>See </em>Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary 1240 (10th ed.1993) (defining \u201ctogether with\u201d as \u201cin addition to\u201d). Three other provisions of the lease use the terms \u201cPremises\u201d and \u201cBuilding\u201d in conjunction with one another. First, \u00a7 6 of the lease concerns \u201crepairs to the Building and Premises\u201d and \u201cwarranties related to the Building and Premises.\u201d Second, \u00a7 7 concerns Carrol\u2019s right to make \u201calterations to the Premises and Building.\u201d And third, \u00a7 8 concerns Carrols\u2019s obligation to \u201ckeep the Premises and the Building insured.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">We note, however, that the reading of \u201cPremises\u201d as adopted by the district court and urged by Carrols actually runs counter to the ordinary meaning of the word \u201cpremises.\u201d \u201cPremises is defined by Merriam Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary 920 (10th ed.1997), as \u2018a tract of land <em>with the buildings thereon.\u2019 \u201d Minges Creek, L.L.C. v. Royal Ins. Co. of America, </em>442 F.3d 953, 957 (6th Cir.2006) (applying Michigan law) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">Reading the lease as a whole, we conclude that the term \u201cPremises\u201d as used in the lease comports with the word\u2019s ordinary meaning. A non-exhaustive survey of other lease provisions yields this conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">First, the gross sales provision in the lease demands that \u201cPremises\u201d include buildings and improvements on the land. Section 3(B) of the lease provides that Carrols\u2019s monthly rent payments due under the lease are determined, in part, by the amount of \u201cGross Sales\u201d \u201cmade at or from the Premises.\u201d Section 3(C)(iii) defines \u201cGross Sales\u201d as \u201cthe amount of gross sales, receipts, revenues and charges of, in connection with and for all merchandise, services, or other operations rendered <em>at, in or from </em>the Premises.\u201d Under Carrols\u2019s reading of \u201cPremises,\u201d \u201cGross Sales\u201d includes only sales \u201cat, in or from\u201d the land \u2014 and does not include sales \u201cat, in or from\u201d the buildings on the land; sales from the Burger King, which operates in a building, would be exempted from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>gross sales. Even sales occurring in the parking lot would be exempted because a parking lot is an improvement to the land. <em>See </em>preamble (defining \u201cBuilding\u201d as \u201call buildings, structures and <em>other improvements\u201d) </em>(emphasis added). The only plausible reading of the gross sales provision requires that \u201cPremises\u201d include buddings and improvements on the land.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Second, the fixtures provision of the lease also demands that \u201cPremises\u201d include buildings and improvements. Section 7(D) provides that Carrols has the right to \u201cremoved from the Premises\u201d within sixty days from the lease\u2019s termination:</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">[a]ny and all movable or removable trade fixtures, equipment and personalty purchased by or belonging to [Carrols] ... including but not limited to [Carrols]\u2019s lighting fixtures, counters and counter tops, chairs, tables (including all public seating components), decor items, fans, stoves, ovens, refi\u2019igerators, bars, walk-in cold storage boxes, restaurant and office equipment, software and other personal property....</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">These items are commonly found inside of buildings, and are certainly found inside-not outside-of Burger King restaurants. \u201cPremises\u201d must include buildings on the property to allow for a rational reading of the fixtures provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">Third, the lease section pertaining to permissible uses of the Premises requires the same understanding of \u201cPremises.\u201d Section 5 provides that Carrols \u201cmay use and occupy the Premises for the purpose of operating a restaurant. The initial use of the Premises shall be for a \u2018Burger King\u2019 restaurant.\u201d Under Carrols\u2019s reading of \u201cPremises,\u201d Carrols would only be permitted to use the land-and not the buildings \u2014 for the operation of the Burger King restaurant. Burger King restaurants do not operate in such fashion. Section 5 also provides that Carrols \u201cshall not permit any operation ... which will in any way violate any certificate of occupancy, if any, affecting the Premises.\u201d Because certificates of occupancy are not issued for undeveloped land, but only buildings, this provision reads illogically if \u201cPremises\u201d does not include buildings and improvements. <em>See </em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (8th ed.2004) (defining \u201ccertificate of occupancy\u201d as \u201c[a] document indicating that a building complies with zoning and building ordinances\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-10\">Fourth, the provisions where \u201cBuilding\u201d and \u201cPremises\u201d appear together lend greater weight to an interpretation of \u201cPremises\u201d that includes buildings and improvements. One such provision is the maintenance and repair provision in \u00a7 6, which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b461-11\">Throughout the Lease Term, Lessee, at its sole cost and expense, except as otherwise provided herein, will take good care of the Premises and will keep the same in good order and condition and make all necessary repairs and replacements thereto, interior and exterior, ordinary and extraordinary, foreseen and unforeseen. The necessity for and adequacy of repairs to the Building and the Premises pursuant to this Article 6 shall be measured by a standard which is appropriate for buildings of similar construction and use.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-12\">Although the second sentence of this provision uses \u201cBuilding\u201d and \u201cPremises\u201d together, a common sense reading reveals that the terms are not mutually exclusive. The first sentence, referring only to \u201cPremises\u201d but not \u201cBuilding,\u201d requires \u201cinterior and exterior\u201d repairs. This sentence can be read logically only if the term \u201cPremises\u201d as used in this sentence includes \u201cBuilding.\u201d Buildings have an interior and exterior, but the same cannot be said of undeveloped land. The term <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>\u201cBuilding\u201d used here, although redundant, does not change this result. <em>See Michigan Tp. Participating Plan v. Pavolich, </em>232 Mich.App. 378, 591 N.W.2d 325, 330 (1998) (holding that \u201ca finding of surplusage does not equate to a finding of ambiguity\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">Section 7 of the lease provides another provision in which \u201cBuilding\u201d and \u201cPremises\u201d are used together. Specifically, \u00a7 7(A) gives Carrols the right to \u201cmake any alterations and additions to the Premises and the Building [that] [Carrols] shall deem necessary.\u201d But as discussed above, the fixtures provision in \u00a7 7(D) requires that \u201cPremises\u201d include buildings and improvements. The same applies to \u00a7 8, which requires Carrols to \u201ckeep the Premises and the Building insured ... against loss or damage by fire or other casualty.\u201d Section 8(B)(i), however, requires Carrols to keep public liability insurance against claims \u201coccurring on, <em>in </em>or about the Premises.\u201d The preposition \u201cin\u201d does not allow for a natural reading of this provision if \u201cthe Premises\u201d \u2014 the object of the preposition \u201cin\u201d \u2014 cannot include buildings or improvements. <em>See </em>\u00a7 7(D) (allowing Carrols, upon termination of the lease to remove certain fixtures <em>\u201cin, </em>at or upon the Premises\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">So although the preamble provides that Carrols \u201clease[s] ... the \u2018Premises\u2019 ... together with ... the \u2018Building,\u2019 \u201d the lease read as a whole informs that the parties understood that \u201cPremises\u201d includes buildings and improvements. This conclusion is consistent with Michigan\u2019s law of contracts, which directs courts to consider all of a contract\u2019s provisions in interpreting the rights of the contracting parties, rather than reading provisions in isolation:</p>\n<p id=\"b462-11\">\u201cThe intention of the parties must be deduced from the entire agreement, not from any part or parts of it, and, where a contract has several stipulations, the intention of the contracting parties is not expressed by any single clause or stipulation, but by every part and provision in it, which must all be considered together, and so construed as to be consistent with every other part.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-12\"><em>Johnston v. Miller, </em>326 Mich. 682, 40 N.W.2d 770, 771-72 (1950).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-13\">Because \u201cPremises\u201d cannot reasonably be read to exclude buildings and improvements, this provision is unambiguous. <em>See Petovello v. Murray, </em>139 Mich.App. 639, 362 N.W.2d 857 (1984) (holding that a contract is ambiguous if the language is susceptible to two or more reasonable interpretations.) Thus, the district court\u2019s entry of summary judgment for Carrols was improper; rather, the district court should have granted Cain\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-14\">Carrols offers extrinsic evidence to support its definition of \u201cPremises,\u201d which we decline to consider.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Under Michigan law, we do not \u201chave the right ... to look to extrinsic testimony to determine [the parties\u2019] intent when the words used by them are clear and unambiguous and have a definite meaning.\u201d <em>UAW-GM Human Res. Ctr. v. KSL Recreation Corp., </em>228 Mich.App. 486, 579 N.W.2d 411, 414 (1998) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-15\">III. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b462-16\">For the reasons stated above, we REVERSE the district court order granting summary judgment for Carrols and REMAND the case to the district court with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>instructions to enter summary judgment for Cain.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b462-6\">. Specifically, Carrols argues that the parties\u2019 exchange of drafts of the lease agreement during its negotiation demonstrates that the valuation provision applies only to the land. It contends that the language in the valuation provision changed repeatedly throughout the negotiation of the lease, and the terms \"Premises\u201d and \"Building\" were at one point both included as part of the valuation clause.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b463-5\">GRIFFIN, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"ARY3\">concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">This is the rare, but classic case of an ambiguous contract. For this reason, I concur in the majority\u2019s holding that the district court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of Carrols, but respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s conclusion that as a matter of law the contract unambiguously defines the term \u201cPremises\u201d to include the buildings and improvements made on the land. In my view, the lease agreement is ambiguous regarding the meaning of \u201cPremises.\u201d Accordingly, I would not grant summary judgment in favor of either party, but would reverse and remand for trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">Our task in interpreting a contract is to \u201cgive effect to every word, phrase, and clause in a contract and avoid an interpretation that would render any part of the contract surplusage or nugatory.\u201d <em>Klapp v. United Ins. Group Agency, Inc., </em>468 Mich. 459, 668 N.W.2d 447, 453 (2003). Where a contract\u2019s language is unambiguous, a question of law is presented, and it is within our province to interpret its meaning. <em>Coates v. Bastian Bros., Inc., </em>276 Mich.App. 498, 741 N.W.2d 539, 543 (2007). \u201cHowever, if provisions of a contract irreconcilably conflict, the contractual language is ambiguous, and the ambiguous contractual language presents a question of fact to be decided by a jury.\u201d <em>Laurel Woods Apts. v. Roumayak, </em>274 Mich.App. 631, 734 N.W.2d 217, 220 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">During the proceedings in this case, the contract has been interpreted three different ways by reasonable jurists. Magistrate Judge Donald A. Scheer ruled that the lease was internally ambiguous, reasoning that the definition of the term \u201cPremises\u201d contained in the preamble conflicts with its later usage in other portions of the agreement. District Judge Denise Page Hood held that the contract unambiguously favors Carrols\u2019 interpretation, concluding that the definition contained in the preamble was controlling. With today\u2019s ruling, the majority now holds as a matter of law that the opposite is true and that the contract is unambiguous in favor of Cain\u2019s interpretation. These divergent interpretations underscore the reality that the contract is inherently ambiguous. Accordingly, I agree with the magistrate judge that \u201c[njeither party has been able to state a convincing argument that a single definition of the term \u2018premises\u2019 can be assigned throughout the agreement without disregarding the specific language employed and/or offending logic\u201d and that, as a result, this conflict presents \u201cthe very essence of \u2018ambiguity.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-10\">The majority begins its analysis by making a crucial observation, pointing out that the term \u201cPremises\u201d is defined in the agreement\u2019s preamble, and again in Schedule A, as referring solely to the land located at 1023 N. West Avenue in Jackson, separate and apart from any improvements made on the land. The preamble provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-11\">Lessor ... does hereby lease ... the following described premises (hereinafter the \u201cPremises\u201d) located at 1023 N. West Avenue, Jackson, MI 49202 and being located at 1023 N. West Avenue, Jackson, MI 49202 and being more particularly described on Schedule A ...; together with all buildings, structures and other improvements whether now existing or hereafter erected thei\u2019eon (hereinafter collectively the \u201cBuilding\u201d) and all easements, rights of way, licenses and appurtenances thereto, and together with all rights and privileges in and about the Premises as may be necessary or convenient to the operations of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>Lessee\u2019s business at the Premises for the term and upon the conditions hereinafter set forth.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">This definition, which incorporates the metes and bounds description found in Schedule A, is the lone definition of \u201cPremises\u201d contained in the agreement, and the district court held that it was controlling over other portions of the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">After conceding that, under the preamble\u2019s definition, \u201cthe terms \u2018Premises\u2019 and \u2018Building\u2019 can be interpreted as being distinct and mutually exclusive,\u201d the majority then explains why the definition of \u201cPremises\u201d contained in the preamble should not control over the remaining portions of the contract and how the term is used throughout the agreement in a way inconsistent with the definition provided in the preamble. I find this analysis persuasive and, as a consequence, I join in the majority\u2019s conclusion that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to Carrols.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">Yet the inescapable fact remains that the agreement\u2019s sole definition of the term \u201cPremises\u201d refers only to the land located on West Avenue. Although the majority ably explains how the term \u201cPremises\u201d is used in other sections of the agreement to refer to both the land and any improvements made thereon, it does not \u2014 and cannot \u2014 reconcile the definition found in the preamble with the later usage of the term. \u201c[I]f two provisions of the same contract irreconcilably conflict with each other, the language of the contract is ambiguous.\u201d <em>Klapp, </em>663 N.W.2d at 458.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">In my view, the appropriate response is not to rewrite the preamble\u2019s definition of the term \u201cPremises\u201d to accord with Merriam Webster\u2019s definition of the word, nor is it to hold that the use of the term in later provisions of the contract trumps its explicit definition contained in the preamble. In this case in which we apply the substantive law of Michigan, I would follow the Michigan Supreme Court\u2019s directive that \u201ccourts cannot simply ignore portions of a contract in order to avoid a finding of ambiguity,\u201d <em>Klapp, </em>663 N.W.2d at 453. Accordingly, I would hold that the present contract is ambiguous and thus remand the case for trial before the trier of fact. Here, a genuine issue of material fact exists making summary judgment unwarranted for either party. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b464-10\">For these reasons, I respectfully concur in part, and dissent in part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
