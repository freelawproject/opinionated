On appeal, Jackson argues that the district court erred because there is precedent establishing that, when necessary for the protection of constitutional rights, the federal courts have the power to issue injunctions enjoining state prosecutions. Jackson argues that the <em>Younger v. Harris, </em>401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971), abstention doctrine does not apply because there are no legitimate state activities at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-13\">We review <em>de novo </em>a <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A for failure to state a claim, <em>Leal v. Ga. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>254 F.3d 1276, 1279 (11th Cir.2001), and review dismissal of a complaint as frivolous pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A for abuse of discretion. <em>Bilal v. Driver, </em>251 F.3d 1346, 1349 (11th Cir.2001). In addressing whether abstention is appropriate in a given case, we review the district court\u2019s decision to abstain for abuse of discretion. <em>Boyes v. Shell Oil Prod. Co., </em>199 F.3d 1260, 1265 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-14\">Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, a federal court is required to dismiss a complaint against a governmental entity or officer or employee of a governmental entity at any time if the court determines that the action \u201c(1) is frivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted; or (2) seeks monetary relief from a defendant who is immune from such relief.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A.</p>\n<p id=\"b839-15\">A claim is frivolous when, on the face of the complaint, the factual allegations are \u201cclearly baseless,\u201d or the legal allegations are \u201cindisputably meritless.\u201d <em>Carroll v. Gross, </em>984 F.2d 392, 393 (11th Cir.1993) (citation omitted). A complaint may be dismissed for failure to state a claim when it appears beyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim that would entitle him to relief. <em>Brower v. County of Inyo, </em>489 U.S. 593, 598, 109 S.Ct. 1378, 1382, 103 L.Ed.2d 628 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-16\">Attentive to the principles of equity, comity, and federalism, the Supreme Court has recognized that federal courts should abstain from exercising jurisdiction in suits aimed at restraining pending state criminal prosecutions. <em>Younger, </em>401 U.S. at 41, 91 S.Ct. at 749; <em>For Your Eyes Alone, Inc. v. City of Columbus, Ga., </em>281 F.3d 1209, 1216 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b839-17\">Jackson\u2019s state criminal prosecution was pending at the time he filed his federal complaint. Thus, if the district court granted relief to Jackson, it would be restraining a pending state criminal prosecution. Accordingly, the district court did not err when it found that Jackson\u2019s complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted. Since the standard of review for failure to state a claim is more stringent than that of dismissal for frivolity, the district court likewise did not err, if it dismissed the complaint for frivol<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"814\">*814</page-number>ity. Furthermore, because the criminal proceedings were ongoing at the time of the complaint, the application of the abstention doctrine by the district court was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-4\">For the aforementioned reasons, we affirm the judgment of dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b840-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
