At sentencing, the district court found that Marshall qualified as a \u201ccareer offender\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1, and sentenced him to 120 months\u2019 imprisonment. Marshall appeals his sentence contending that he does not qualify as a career offender because the district court erred in finding that his prior conviction under California Vehicle Code \u00a7 2800.2 (\u201c\u00a7 2800.2\u201d) was a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a). We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-15\">We hold that Marshall\u2019s conviction under \u00a7 2800.2, for flight from a pursuing police officer in willful or wanton disregard for the safety of persons or property, is not categorically a crime of violence. <em>See United States v. Jennings, </em>515 F.3d 980, 989-91 (9th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Kelly, </em>422 F.3d 889, 895 (9th Cir.2005) (holding that a Washington state conviction for attempting to elude a pursuing police officer was not a crime of violence because the statute criminalized conduct that did not \u201cpresent[ ] a serious potential risk of physical injury to another,\u201d as required by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2)).</p>\n<p id=\"b709-16\">Under the modified categorical approach, we also hold that Marshall\u2019s \u00a7 2800.2 conviction is not a crime of violence. Marshall\u2019s statement in his plea agreement that he was \u201cdriving recklessly\u201d is insufficient to establish that he was convicted of a crime of violence. <em>See Kelly, </em>422 F.3d at 896.</p>\n<p id=\"b709-17\">Because Marshall\u2019s prior conviction under \u00a7 2800.2 does not, under our court\u2019s case law, constitute a crime of violence, the district court erred in sentencing him as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>career offender. We therefore vacate Marshall\u2019s sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-4\">VACATE and REMAND.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b709-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
