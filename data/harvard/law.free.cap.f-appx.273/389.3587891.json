He was sentenced to serve 240 months in prison. He filed a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 habeas corpus petition to challenge his convictions, and he now appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his \u00a7 2241 petition. Johnson argues that his judgment of conviction is void and he is entitled to \u00a7 2241 relief because he was prosecuted under the wrong indictment. He further argues that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 relief does not provide an adequate remedy to address this claim, and he contends that he is actually innocent. Johnson moves this court to take judicial notice of facts con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>cerning the errors in his judgment and the indictments.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-4\">Johnson has not shown that the district court erred in determining that his purported \u00a7 2241 petition was best construed as an unauthorized successive \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 877 (5th Cir.2000); <em>Cox v. Warden, Fed. Del. Ctr., </em>911 F.2d 1111, 1113 (5th Cir. 1990). Johnson likewise has not shown that he should be permitted to proceed under the savings clause of \u00a7 2255. <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 904 (5th Cir.2001); <em>Pack v. Yusuff, </em>218 F.3d 448, 452-53 (5th Cir.2000). The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. All outstanding motions are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"AWlh\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
