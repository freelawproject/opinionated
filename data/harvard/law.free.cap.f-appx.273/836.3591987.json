Specifically, Thampi alleged that he had \u201cexercised his First Amendment right of free speech by reporting to supervisors and criticizing waste and gross mismanagement of public funds, resources and projects in Collier County\u201d and was fired as a result.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-17\">We find, on this record, that the district court did not err in concluding that the speech alleged did not rise to a First Amendment violation because it pertained to official job-related matters. We also reject as meritless Thampi\u2019s argument that Collier County Policy 5311.1(10) is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b862-18\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
