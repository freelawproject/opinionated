At sentencing, the district court found that Canfield committed four prior crimes of violence and accordingly was a career offender under the federal sentencing guidelines. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a). Canfield appeals his sentence, arguing that the district court erroneously determined that he was a career offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b592-18\">Although the sentencing guidelines list several criteria to determine whether a defendant is a career offender, the only one that the parties disputed at sentencing was whether Canfield had at least two prior felony convictions for crimes of violence. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a). The parties agreed that Canfield\u2019s prior conviction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"567\">*567</page-number>for burglary of a dwelling in Florida was a crime of violence, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2), but disagreed about whether his conviction in Iowa for theft, <em>see </em>Iowa Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 714.1, 714.2(1), and two other convictions in Iowa for robbery, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7\u00a7 711.1, 711.3, were also crimes of violence. The court determined that all of these convictions were for crimes of violence, and thus it concluded that Canfield was a career offender. Applying the career offender guideline, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b), the court calculated Canfield\u2019s base offense level at 32. It then determined he was entitled to a 3-point downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, bringing his offense level to 29. With a criminal history score of VI, Can-field\u2019s guidelines imprisonment range was 151 to 188 months. The court then addressed the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors and sentenced Canfield to a term of 168 months, just a tad short of the middle of the guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s determination that a defendant is a career offender. <em>See United States v. Cole, </em>298 F.3d 659, 661 (7th Cir.2002). We take a categorical approach in deciding whether a prior conviction was for a crime of violence, so we start by looking at the elements of the statute of conviction and the charging document. <em>See United States v. Newbern, </em>479 F.3d 506, 508 (7th Cir.2007). If we cannot conclude, based on the statute and charging document, whether the prior crime is a crime of violence, we then consider information in other documents, such as plea agreements and transcripts of plea colloquies.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-6\">On appeal, Canfield continues to press his argument that his theft and robbery offenses are not crimes of violence. An offense is a crime of violence under three circumstances: (1) if it involves \u201cuse, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(l); (2) if it is enumerated as a crime of violence in \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2); or (3) if it \u201cinvolves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2). The parties agree that Canfield\u2019s Iowa convictions did not involve use or threats of force and are not designated specifically as crimes of violence. The only question that remains is whether any of Canfield\u2019s three convictions was for a crime that posed a serious risk of injury to another person. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B 1.2(a)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b593-8\">We turn first to Canfield\u2019s conviction for theft. Canfield was charged in an information with three counts of \u201ctak[ing] possession or control of the property of another with the intent to deprive the owner thereof, that said theft of property was from the person of another, to wit: Beecher\u2019s on Asbury ... Amoco Food Stop on JFK Road ... Q-Mart on South Main Street,\u201d in violation of Iowa Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 714.1 and 714.2(1). Canfield argues that because the charging documents list names of businesses, he was convicted of stealing from those businesses, not from other individuals. He points out that, under Iowa law, a business can be a \u201cperson,\u201d and thus, he insists, stealing from a business is consistent with the charge that he took property \u201cfrom the person of another.\u201d <em>See </em>Iowa Code Ann. \u00a7 4.1(20). And he contends that stealing from a business does not pose a serious risk of injury, and therefore this crime is not a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b593-9\">We reject Canfield\u2019s argument because the statute and charging document show that he was convicted of theft from individuals, not businesses. The charging document says that Canfield was charged with theft in the first degree, which Iowa Code \u00a7 714.2(a) defines as \u201ctheft of property exceeding ten thousand dollars in value, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"568\">*568</page-number>theft of property from the person of another, or from a building which has been destroyed or left unoccupied because of physical disaster, riot, bombing or the proximity of battle.\u201d Iowa Code Ann. \u00a7 714.2(a). Specifically, Canfield was charged with taking \u201cpossession or control of the property of another ... from the person of another.\u201d Although a \u201cperson\u201d can be a business for some purposes under Iowa law, the phrase \u201cof another\u201d here refers to another individual, not a business. The Supreme Court of Iowa has said that it is the taking \u201cfrom the victim\u2019s area of control\u201d that triggers the heightened penalty for first degree theft because it creates the potential for a violent confrontation between the thief and the victim. <em>See State v. Washington, </em>808 N.W.2d 422, 428 (Iowa 1981). This concern does not apply if the victim is a business; thus, simple theft from an individual is first-degree theft, but simple theft from a business is not. The charging document is silent about the aggravating factors that could elevate theft from a business to first-degree theft \u2014 theft of more than $10,000 or conduct that amounts to looting. So we must conclude that Canfield was charged with theft from other individuals and that the list of businesses in the charging document is superfluous. <em>See Newbem, </em>479 F.3d at 510.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">Theft from an individual carries the risk of physical injury because there is the \u201cpotential for physical confrontation with the thief.\u201d <em>Washington, </em>308 N.W.2d at 423. And the Eighth Circuit has found that a conviction under these statutes for theft from another person constitutes a conviction for a crime of violence for purposes of \u00a7 4B1.2(a) because there is a \u201clikelihood that the victim will resist or defend in a manner that will lead to immediate violence.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>326 F.3d 934, 937 (8th Cir.2003). This reasoning is in line with our holding in <em>United States v. Howze, </em>343 F.3d 919 (7th Cir.2003), that a theft from an individual constitutes a violent felony under the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e). <em>Howze, </em>343 F.3d at 924. We use the same analysis to determine whether a crime is a \u201cviolent felony\u201d under the Armed Career Criminal Act as we use to decide if it is a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for the career criminal guideline. <em>See United States v. McGee, </em>408 F.3d 966, 988 (7th Cir.2005). So we agree with the district court that Canfield\u2019s conviction for theft is a crime of violence.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">Because Canfield\u2019s conviction for theft is his second conviction for a crime of violence, the district court correctly concluded that he was subject to the increased guidelines range. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(b). But for the sake of completeness we address Canfield\u2019s two convictions for robbery and conclude that they, too, are crimes of violence. One information charged that \u201cwith the intent to commit a theft,\u201d Canfield \u201ccommitted] an assault upon the person of Cindy Loeffeihols, to assist or further the commission of the intended theft or the person\u2019s escape from the scene, \u201cand the second charged that\u201d while having the intent to commit a theft, \u201cCanfield\u201d did commit an assault upon another in the furtherance of his escape from the scene thereof,\u201d both in violation of Iowa Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 711.1 and 711.3. Can-field argues that, because an assault under Iowa law does not require physical contact (or threatened physical conduct) with the victim, his conduct did not pose a serious potential risk of injury. This argument, however, ignores the fact that some offenses that do not involve force nonetheless are considered crimes of violence. It is enough that a crime presents a serious risk of injury; it is not necessary that the crime also involves the use or threatened use of force. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a)(l); <em>see, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number><em>e.g., Cole, </em>298 F.3d at 661-62 (mob action statute did not have as element the use or threat of force but offense was a crime of violence because it posed serious risk of injury).</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">Canfield is correct to point out that the charging document for one of his robberies puts forward two alternative charges \u2014 that he committed an assault to further the commission of the theft <em>or </em>to further his escape. But in either case, the conduct charged posed a serious risk of injury. First, a confrontation with another person while taking steps to commit a theft poses a serious risk that injury will result. Whether the victim is the subject of the theft or merely a bystander, the confrontation has the potential to escalate into violence and cause serious injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">The information charges, in the alternative, that Canfield assaulted another person to further his escape. And Canfield\u2019s second robbery conviction was also for assaulting another person while escaping the scene of a theft. We have held that, when a perpetrator flees to avoid apprehension, he creates a serious risk of harm to bystanders, and thus the flight is a crime of violence. <em>See Howze, </em>343 F.3d at 922; <em>United States v. Bryant, </em>310 F.3d 550, 554 (7th Cir.2002). Canfield attempts to distinguish these cases, noting they dealt with suspects fleeing from the police or escaping from police custody. But the same concerns apply when a perpetrator flees the scene of a crime, even if he has not yet been caught by law enforcement. There is a serious risk that the thief will harm an innocent person in an attempt to make a quick getaway and to evade capture, whether or not the police are already on his tail.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-8\">Canfield has been convicted of four crimes of violence, two more than necessary to be classified as a career offender. Thus, the district court did not err in calculating his guidelines range using the career offender enhancement. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
