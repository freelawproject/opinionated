The court sentenced Kelly to a total of 147 months in prison, and Kelly timely appealed. Kelly\u2019s attorney filed a brief in accordance with <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), certifying that there are no meritorious grounds for appeal, but questioning whether the crack cocaine to powder cocaine disparity applied by the district court in sentencing was unconstitutional. The Government did not file a reply brief. Kelly was advised of his right to file a pro se supplemental brief, but has not done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-4\">In accordance with our obligation under <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed Kelly\u2019s conviction and find no reversible error. His guilty plea was accepted after a properly-concluded Fed.R.Crim.P. 11 hearing, and he does not contend that his plea was involuntary. Accordingly, we affirm his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-5\">As to his sentence, Kelly argues that the crack cocaine to powder cocaine disparity employed in sentencing is unconstitutional. Kelly was sentenced to 87 months in prison on Count One; the statutory range for the count is five years to forty years. 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(B). While the appeal was pending, the Supreme Court issued <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), holding that \u201cit would not be an abuse of discretion for a district court to conclude when sentencing a particular defendant that the crack/powder disparity yields a sentence \u2018greater than necessary\u2019 to achieve \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s purposes, even in a mine-run case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 575. In <em>Kimbrough </em>the Court remanded to permit the district court to consider the appropriateness of applying the 100-to-l ratio of crack cocaine to powder cocaine in sentencing. Accordingly, we vacate Kelly\u2019s sentence and remand for the purpose of allowing the court to resentence Kelly in accordance with <em>Kimbrough </em>and <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 2D1.1 (2007) (Amendment 706).</p>\n<p id=\"b266-9\">This court requires that counsel inform Kelly, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If Kelly requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Kelly.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-10\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-11\">\n<em>AFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
