Petitioners seek asylum, withholding of removal, and deferral of removal under the Convention Against Torture. The Immigration Judge (IJ) denied petitioners\u2019 claims, and the BIA affirmed. Petitioners moved to reopen, and the BIA denied their motions on the ground that they were filed out of time. Because the BIA did not abuse its discretion, we will deny the consolidated petitions for review of the BIA\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>decisions denying the Zallas\u2019 motions to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">As we write only for the parties, we do not set out the facts in great detail. The Zalla family arrived in the United States in August 1999. Mr. and Mrs. Zalla\u2019s first interview with the immigration authorities occurred at the airport. There, Mr. Zalla explained that he was a butcher from a wealthy family, and his life had been threatened by \u201c[t]wo people [who] came to my father and wanted $50,000 or they would kill me.\u201d Appendix (App.) 648. According to Mr. Zalla, the family decided to flee Albania as a result of this incident. Mrs. Zalla echoed Mr. Zalla and stated that they had fled Albania because of the problems her husband had described.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">Four days later, at his credible fear interview, Mr. Zalla again explained that he feared persecution in Albania due to his membership in a prominent, wealthy family. He reiterated the same story he had told upon arrival in the United States\u2014 that two people threatened his father, demanded $50,000, and stated that \u201cif you don\u2019t give us the money, we will shoot your son.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 664. According to Mr. Zalla, the two people \u201cmay have been gang members or Mafia.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Mr. Zalla explained that his father then received threatening phone calls, and shots were fired at his house. Mr. Zalla stated that \u201cthe only reason I came to the U.S. was to get away from these people.... I am worried about being shot by these people.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 665.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-8\">When Mr. Zalla applied for asylum in 2000, however, he presented a different set of reasons for fleeing Albania. He claimed that \u201cwith the climbing to power of the Socialist Party\u201d in Albania, he and his family were \u201cvictim[s] of the Socialist preasure <em>[sic]\u201d </em>and persecution. <em>Id. </em>at 1590. Mr. Zalla stated that he had been \u201can important member of the Forum of Youth\u201d and a financial supporter and member of the Democratic Party. <em>Id. </em>According to Mr. Zalla, he was beaten by the police, and his family was subject to machine gun fire. When Mrs. Zalla filed her asylum application in 2002, she also stated that she feared persecution by the Socialist Party due to her husband\u2019s leadership in the Youth Forum of the Democratic Party. In addition, she claimed that members of the Socialist Party had raped her, and explained that \u201chired gunmen\u201d were looking for her husband. <em>Id. </em>at 1582-88.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-10\">After hearing testimony from the petitioners, on June 12, 2002 the IJ issued an oral decision, ordering their removal. The IJ concluded that the testimony of Mr. and Mrs. Zalla was not credible. He also determined that Mrs. Zalla\u2019s asylum application was untimely because it was filed more than one year after her arrival and she had not provided \u201cany proof of changed or extraordinary circumstances.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 175. The IJ pointed to the fact that Mr. Zalla\u2019s testimony included several incidents not described in his asylum application, and his application contained no reference to Mrs. Zalla\u2019s rape. In addition, the IJ noted that the statements that Mr. and Mrs. Zalla made to airport officials upon their arrival made no reference to any of the facts upon which their asylum applications were later based. According to the IJ, the statement taken irom Mr. Zalla at the airport was \u201cextremely damaging.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 174. The IJ concluded that \u201cthis is in effect a fish tale that becomes more ornate every time it\u2019s told.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b197-11\">On October 16, 2003, the BIA affirmed, without opinion, the IJ\u2019s decision with respect to Mr. Zalla. The BIA also affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision with respect to Mrs. Zalla and concluded that her asylum application was untimely. The Zallas filed a motion to reconsider in November 2003, which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>BIA denied in January 2004 on the ground that \u201crespondents\u2019 motion simply seeks another opportunity to present their claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1622.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">In September 2006, petitioners filed motions to reopen based on changed country conditions. On November 17, 2006, the BIA denied the motions on the ground that they were filed out of time, and in any event, the evidence in support of the motion was \u201cinsufficient\u201d to show that the Zallas\u2019 were \u201celigible for asylum based on changed circumstances in Albania.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 2. The BIA observed that Armando Zalla \u201cwas found not to be credible by the Immigration Judge, and we affirmed that decision.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The BIA noted that it had denied the Zallas\u2019 previous motion to reconsider because it \u201cwas simply an effort to present the same claim that had already been denied.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The BIA concluded that the motions to reopen were similarly \u201can attempt to shore up the [Armando Zalla\u2019s] incredible claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">We have jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s decision under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Venue is proper in this Court because the proceedings before the IJ were completed in Newark, New Jersey. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">This Court reviews denials of motions to reopen under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>See Borges v. Gonzales, </em>402 F.3d 398, 404 (3d Cir.2005). We must, therefore, uphold the BIA\u2019s decision to deny a motion to reopen unless the decision is \u201carbitrary, irrational, or contrary to law.\u201d <em>Guo v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 556, 562 (3d Cir.2004) (quotation marks omitted). The BIA\u2019s factual conclusions related to the motion are reviewed for substantial evidence. <em>Sevoian v. Ashcroft, </em>290 F.3d 166, 168 (3d Cir.2002). A petitioner who seeks reversal of the BIA\u2019s findings of fact must \u201cshow that the evidence was so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find in her favor.\u201d <em>Barker v. Ashcroft, </em>382 F.3d 313, 316 (3d Cir.2003) (quotation marks omitted). Motions to reopen raise \u201cimportant finality concerns\u201d and are generally disfavored. <em>Shardar v. Ashcroft, </em>382 F.3d 318, 324-25 (3d Cir.2004) (quotation marks omitted). A motion to reopen \u201cshall not be granted unless it appears to the Board that evidence sought to be offered is material and was not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the former hearing.\u201d <em>Caushi v. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>436 F.3d 220, 231 (3d Cir.2006) <em>(quoting </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(1)).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-10\">Motions to reopen must be filed within ninety days of the BIA\u2019s decision. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). The time bar of \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2) does not apply, however, if the alien seeks to admit material evidence of \u201cchanged circumstances arising in the country of nationality or in the country to which deportation has been ordered,\u201d which \u201cwas not available and could not have been discovered or presented at the previous hearing.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b198-11\">In the instant case, the BIA entered its decision on October 16, 2003, and the motion to reopen was due ninety days thereafter. Petitioners, however, waited nearly <em>three years </em>to file their motions to reopen in September 2006. According to petitioners, \u201cthe substantial medical evidence\u201d that revealed the impact of Mrs. Zalla\u2019s rape on the family only became available after years of psychological and medical treatment and constitutes a \u201c \u2018change in [Mrs. Zalla\u2019s] circumstances that materially affeet[s] [the Zallas\u2019] eligibility for asylum.\u2019 \u201d Petitioner Reply Br. at 3 <em>(quoting </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.4(a)(4)(i)(B)). In addition, petitioners argue that Mr. Zalla\u2019s political <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>activities in the United States in support of the Albanian Democratic Party and the repercussions of his activities in Albania also constitute \u201cchanged circumstances\u201d that warrant reopening the Zallas\u2019 case. <em>Id. </em>at 3-4. Petitioners contend therefore that the BIA erred in finding that the evidence they submitted was \u201cinsufficient\u201d to show changed circumstances. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-7\">Rather than challenging the BIA\u2019s decision to reject their motions to reopen, the Zallas\u2019 appeal focuses primarily on the merits of the underlying case. The BIA\u2019s decision affirming the Immigration Judge\u2019s denial of asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture is, however, not currently before this Court. The Zallas did not file a petition for review of the final order of deportation, and any such petition would be untimely. A petition for review of a final order of removal \u201cmust be filed not later than 30 days after the date of the final order of removal.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1). This time period is \u201cjurisdictional in nature and must be construed with strict fidelity to [its] terms.\u201d <em>Stone v. </em>I.N.S., 514 U.S. 386, 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995). Our analysis must therefore be limited to the timeliness of the motions to reopen, not the merits of the Zallas\u2019 challenge to the underlying deportation order.</p>\n<p id=\"ABQ\">The Zallas\u2019 motions were filed almost three years late and they have not shown the changed circumstances necessary to exempt them from the ninety-day time limitation. The Government correctly observes that petitioners\u2019 motions are \u201cessentially an attempt to explain or bolster an adverse credibility finding rendered in 2002.\u201d Respondent Br. at 12. The evidence the Zallas submitted is merely an ,, , , , , . ,, , ,, tt n attempt to shore-up claims that the IJ and BIA found to be incredible. Accordingly, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying the Zallas\u2019 motions to reopen,</p>\n<p id=\"AXI\">jy</p>\n<p id=\"At\">For the foregoing reasons, we will deny the consolidated petitions for review of the BIA\u2019s decisions denying the Zallas\u2019 motions to reopen,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
