On May 31, 2007, the BIA, affirming the decision of the IJ, denied Patel caneellation of removal due to Patel\u2019s failure to demonstrate exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to his U.S. citizen children, <em>see </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(1)(D). <em>In re Jitendra Patel, </em>No. A96 437 244 (B.I.A. May 31, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A96 437 244 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Nov. 15, 2005). Patel now petitions this Court for review of the BIA\u2019s final decision. The government contends that we do not have jurisdiction to review this discretionary determination. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, procedural history, and scope of the issues presented on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-19\">Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)\u00ae, this Court lacks jurisdiction to review \u201cany judgment regarding the granting of relief under ... [8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b].\u201d We have held that \u201cexceptional and extremely unusual\u201d hardship determinations by the BIA are discretionary judgements. <em>BarcoSandoval v. Gonzales, </em>516 F.3d 35, 39 (2d Cir.2008) (rehabilitating <em>De La Vega v. Gonzales, </em>436 F.3d 141 (2d Cir.2006)). We nonetheless maintain jurisdiction to review \u201cconstitutional claims or questions of law.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). For example, an argument \u201cthat a discretionary decision was based on a legally erroneous standard raises a question of law\u201d over which we would have jurisdiction. <em>Barco-Sandoval, </em>516 F.3d at 40 (internal quotation marks omitted). Patel, however, in challenging the BIA\u2019s determination, has failed to raise a non-frivolous constitutional claim or question of law. We therefore lack jurisdiction to consider his petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-20\">The petition is DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
