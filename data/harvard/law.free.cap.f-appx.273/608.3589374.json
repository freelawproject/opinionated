The complicated facts and procedural history are known to the parties, and we recite them only as necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">In appeal No. 07-16645, the <em>Veliz </em>plaintiffs appeal the district court\u2019s order confirming in part and vacating in part the arbitrator\u2019s award. We vacate and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">On December 5, 2006, the district court issued an order remanding to the arbitrator for clarification of his clause construction award. In its remand order, the district court made an error of law. It stated, under the doctrine of <em>functus officio, </em>the court \u201ccould not allow the arbitrator to \u2018redetermine an issue which he has already decided.\u2019\u201d We note that four of the five arbitration agreements covering the <em>Veliz </em>plaintiffs include clauses permitting the arbitrator to reconsider a prior decision. Given the presence of these reconsideration clauses, the issue of whether the agreements permitted the arbitrator to issue a new award covering any or all of the plaintiffs was a question of contract interpretation for the arbitrator to decide, rather than the district court. The district court erred by deciding the issue for the arbitrator.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">The arbitrator was bound by the district court\u2019s erroneous determination. <em>See </em>American Arbitration Association, Supplementary Rules for Class Arbitrations, Rule 1(c), available at http://www.adr.org/sp. asp?id=21936. In reliance on the district court\u2019s ruling, the arbitrator issued an order on May 7, 2007, in which he determined he could not reconsider the clause construction award, although he believed he had decided some of the issues incorrectly and although he recognized many of the arbitration agreements contained reconsideration clauses. The arbitrator clearly stated he wished to reconsider his prior award, but was unable to because of the district court\u2019s determination he was <em>functus officio.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b635-9\">Thus, the arbitrator\u2019s final award was premised on the district court\u2019s erroneous ruling that he could not reconsider his prior rulings. Accordingly, we vacate the district court\u2019s December 5, 2006 order and its September 5, 2007 order confirming in part and vacating in part the arbitrator\u2019s award. <em>See </em>Green <em>Tree Financial Corp. v. Bazzle, </em>539 U.S. 444, 454, 123 S.Ct. 2402,156 L.Ed.2d 414 (2003) (plurality) (\u201c[T]here is at least a strong likelihood ... the arbitrator\u2019s decision reflected a court\u2019s interpretation of the contracts rather than an arbitrator\u2019s interpretation. That being so, we remand the case so that the arbitrator may decide the question of contract interpretation.\u201d) We remand with instructions to the district court to remand to the arbitrator for <em>de novo </em>consideration. The arbitrator should determine in the first instance whether he has the authority to reconsider his piior award as to any or all the plaintiffs, and if so, whether to redetermine his final award. <em>See Troy Chem. Corp. v. Teamsters Union Local No. 408, </em>37 F.3d 123, 128 (3d Cir. 1994) (vacating the district court\u2019s entry of summary judgment on declaratory judgment action where the district court erroneously determined a procedural question which should have been left for the arbitrator, and remanding to the district court with instructions to return the case to the arbitrator for <em>de novo </em>consideration); <em>see also Bazzle, </em>539 U.S. at 454, 123 S.Ct. 2402. On remand, the arbitrator is not bound to follow the district court\u2019s view whether the plaintiffs have the ability to proceed on a class or collective basis. Rather, he is free to exercise the full extent of his authority under the arbitration agreements.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-10\">In appeal No. 07-15009, Cintas appeals the district court\u2019s order holding the <em>Veliz </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>plaintiffs\u2019 motion to confirm in part and vacate in part the arbitrator\u2019s award was timely filed. There is no dispute, however, that Cintas timely filed its own motion to confirm in part and vacate in part the arbitrator\u2019s award, and that plaintiffs timely appealed the district court\u2019s final judgment on Cintas\u2019s said motion. The district court\u2019s final judgment is properly before us. We vacate the district court\u2019s final judgment and remand with instructions to remand to the arbitrator; accordingly, there is no final award from the arbitrator in this case. Thus, Cintas\u2019s challenge to the timeliness of plaintiffs\u2019 motion to confirm in part and vacate in part the arbitrator\u2019s prior award is denied as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">VACATED AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b634-20\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
