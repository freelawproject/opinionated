The ALJ found that Respondent Homer D. Bronson Company (\u201cBronson\u201d or \u201cthe Company\u201d) had violated provisions of the National Labor Relations Act (\u201cthe Act\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 151, <em>et seq., </em>in various ways during an organizing campaign conducted at its Winsted, Connecticut facility by the United Automobile, Aerospace &amp; Agricultural Implement Workers of America, Region 9A, AFL-CIO (\u201cUnion\u201d or \u201cUAW\u201d). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>Bronson filed timely objections to the enforcement of the Order. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-5\">This Court\u2019s review of the Board\u2019s orders is \u201cquite limited.\u201d <em>NLRB v. Katz\u2019s Delicatessen, </em>80 F.3d 755, 763 (2d Cir. 1996). \u201cWe must enforce the Board\u2019s order where its legal conclusions ai\u2019e reasonably based, and its factual findings are supported by substantial evidence on the record as a whole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In this context, reversal based on a factual question is warranted only if, based on the record as a whole, \u201cno rational trier of fact could reach the conclusion drawn by the Board.\u201d <em>NLRB v. Albany Steel, Inc., </em>17 F.3d 564, 568 (2d Cir.1994). Accordingly, this Court \u201cmay not displace the Board\u2019s choice between two fairly conflicting views, even though [it] would justifiably have made a different choice had the matter been before [it] <em>de novo.\u201d Newspaper Guild of N.Y., Local No. 3 v. NLRB, </em>261 F.3d 291, 301 (2d Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Finally, our review of credibility determinations made by the ALJ and accepted by the NLRB is even more limited, as such determinations may not be disturbed \u201cunless incredible or flatly contradicted by undisputed documentary testimony.\u201d <em>Katz\u2019s Delicatessen, </em>80 F.3d at 763; <em>see also NLRB v. Am. GeriCare, Inc., </em>697 F.2d 56, 60 (2d Cir.1982) (noting that credibility determinations may not be overturned unless they are \u201chopelessly incredible\u201d or \u201cflatly contradict either the law of nature or undisputed documentary testimony\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b61-6\">In this Court, Bronson challenges only four of the 13 violations found by the ALJ and affirmed by the NLRB. The Board is entitled to summary enforcement of the nine unfair labor practice findings not contested by Bronson. <em>See Torrington Extend-A-Care Employee Ass\u2019n v. NLRB, </em>17 F.3d 580, 590 (2d Cir.1994). Accordingly, the petition for enforcement of the Order with respect to these uncontested violations is GRANTED.</p>\n<p id=\"b61-8\">Bronson first argues that the NLRB erred in concluding that the posters and speeches used and given by Charlie Spencer, the president of the automotive group of Bronson\u2019s parent company, and Joseph Blancato, Bronson\u2019s president of manufacturing, during the organizing campaign violated Section 8(a)(1) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1). Section 8(a)(1) of the Act makes it an unfair labor practice \u201cfor an employer to interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise\u201d of their rights under Section 7. 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(1). Section 8(c) of the Act, however, protects the right of employers to express \u201cany views, argument, or opinion, or the dissemination thereof, whether in written, printed, graphic, or visual form ... if such expression contains no threat of reprisal or force or promise of benefit.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b61-9\">In <em>NLRB v. Gissel, </em>395 U.S. 575, 618, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 23 L.Ed.2d 547 (1969), the Supreme Court enunciated the parameters of acceptable employer expression in the context of the employer\u2019s opposition to unionization:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b61-10\">[A]n employer is free to communicate to his employees any of his general views about unionism or any of his specific views about a particular union, so long as the communications do not contain a \u2018threat of reprisal or force or promise of benefit.\u2019 He may even make a prediction as to the precise effects he believes unionization will have on his company. In such a case, however, the prediction must be carefully phrased on the basis of objective fact to convey an employer\u2019s belief as to demonstrably probable consequences beyond his control or to con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>vey a management decision already arrived at to close the plant in case of unionization.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b62-4\">In assessing whether an employer\u2019s expression violated the Act, this Court \u201ctakes into account \u2018the economic dependence of the employees on their employers, and the necessary tendency of the former, because of that relationship, to pick up intended implications of the latter that might be more readily dismissed by a more disinterested ear.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kinney Drugs, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>74 F.3d 1419, 1427 (2d Cir.1996) (quoting <em>Gissel, </em>395 U.S. at 617, 89 S.Ct. 1918). In <em>Gissel, </em>the Court emphasized the importance of the employer\u2019s reliance on objective fact in assessing the propriety of a challenged statement by any employer, noting, \u201c[i]f there is any implication that an employer may or may not take action solely on his own initiative for reasons unrelated to economic necessities and known only to him, the statement is no longer a reasonable prediction based on available facts but a threat of retaliation based on misrepresentation and coercion, and as such without the protection of the First Amendment.\u201d <em>Gissel, </em>395 U.S. at 618, 89 S.Ct. 1918.</p>\n<p id=\"b62-5\">Bronson primarily relies on the Board\u2019s decisions in <em>Stanadyne Auto. Corp., </em>345 NLRB No. 6, 2005 WL 2342111 (2005), and <em>Smithfield Foods, Inc., </em>347 NLRB No. 109, 2006 WL 2559835 (2006), two cases in which the NLRB determined that the employers\u2019 conduct did not constitute impermissible threats, to argue that its conduct was permitted. The speeches made by Spencer and Blancato, however, differ in several important ways from the speeches determined to be permissible in <em>Stanadyne Automotive </em>and <em>Smithfield Foods. </em>A review of the record in this case however demonstrates that neither Spencer nor Blancato made it clear that he was not making threats or predicting the future. Rather, in a November 22, 2000, speech during which Spencer described the closing of one Bronson facility after it was unionized, Spencer told the employees that those who don\u2019t \u201cread history are bound to repeat it.\u201d In his comments during that speech stating the Company had decided to close its unionized Beacon Hill facility because it was \u201cfed up and tired of strikes and disruption\u201d and move the work to Winsted, which had \u201calways been non-union,\u201d Spencer explicitly tied the closing of the Beacon Hill facility to its employees\u2019 union representation. He implied, moreover, that the Winsted facility\u2019s lack of a unionized work force had resulted in it remaining open when other plants had closed. This implied threat of plant closing was only strengthened by his request that the employees not let the Union do to the \u201cnew Homer Bronson\u201d what it did to the \u201cold Homer Bronson.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b62-7\">Further, in a December 5, 2000 speech, Spencer stated that, \u201calthough strikes are not inevitable, everyone knows that where unions are \u2014 strikes occur.\u201d From the employee\u2019s perspective, this comment reinforced the threatening theme of Bronson\u2019s comments to its employees: unions lead to strikes and strikes lead to plant closures. Although the precise content of Blancato\u2019s speeches is not ascertainable, a review of the employees\u2019 hearing testimony demonstrates that at least some of them took from his speeches the message that other plants had closed because they were unionized facilities. Moreover, when one employee sought clarification from Blancato regarding the meaning of his comment about closures, rather than specifically disavow any implied prediction that the facility would close as the plant manager in <em>Stanadyne Automotive </em>had done, Blancato responded that a closure or move \u201ccould\u201d happen. Unlike the employees in <em>Stanadyne Automotive, </em>therefore, Bronson\u2019s employees were not left merely to draw <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>the inference that unionization leads to plant closures; rather, Spencer and Blancato made that point clear, and suggested that the same could happen at Bronson\u2019s Winsted facility. <em>See Gissel, </em>395 U.S. at 618, 89 S.Ct. 1918 (\u201cIf there is any implication that an employer may or may not take action solely on his own initiative for reasons unrelated to economic necessities and known only to him, the statement is no longer a reasonable prediction based on available facts but a threat of retaliation based on misrepresentation and coercion .... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b63-5\">Further, the poster and overhead projection, while likely permissible on their own, served to emphasize the theme of the Company\u2019s impermissible statements to its employees. <em>See UARCO, Inc., </em>286 NLRB 55, 58 (NLRB 1987) (considering the company\u2019s literature and oral statements \u201cas a whole\u201d and noting that \u201c[b]oth the courts and the Board have long held that statements and written materials must be viewed in context and not in isolation\u201d). The record demonstrates that the posters and overhead projections were displayed and referred to by Blancato and Spencer during their speeches to the employees. The contents of these posters and projections focused on the plant closings alleged by Bronson representatives to have been caused by the unionization of those plants\u2019 employees, and they served to reinforce the threatening and impermissible message of the speeches given during the meetings with employees. Accordingly, the Board\u2019s legal conclusion \u2014 that Spencer and Blancato\u2019s posters and speeches constituted impermissible threats of plant closure and job loss \u2014 is firmly rooted in the record and supported by substantial evidence. The petition for enforcement is GRANTED with respect to this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b63-6\">Bronson next argues that the record does not support the Board\u2019s finding that the Company violated Sections 8(a)(1) and 8(a)(3) of the Act when it: (1) prohibited employee Roberta Tyree from working her regular overtime hours; (2) declined to accommodate employee Viterbo \u201cTony\u201d Pimentel\u2019s light-duty work restrictions; and (3) terminated Pimentel after discovering that he was working elsewhere. Section 8(a)(3) makes it an unfair labor practice for an employer to discriminate \u201cin regard to hire or tenure of employment or any term or condition of employment to encourage or discourage membership in any labor organization.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(3). A violation of Section 8(a)(3) of the Act also constitutes a violation of Section 8(a)(1). <em>See NLRB v. J. Coty Messenger Sen., Inc., </em>763 F.2d 92, 98 (2d Cir.1985). This Court has noted that \u201c[t]he key issue in [these] cases is the employer\u2019s motivation.\u201d <em>NLRB v. S.E. Nichols, Inc., </em>862 F.2d 952, 957 (2d Cir.1988). The Board analyzes unlawful motivation claims using a burden-shifting analysis, under which the General Counsel must first demonstrate that protected conduct was \u201ca motivating factor\u201d in the challenged employment decision. <em>Id. </em>Then, the employer bears the burden of demonstrating, as an affirmative defense, that the challenged decision would have occurred \u201cin any event and for valid reasons.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Finally, the General Counsel can defeat the employer\u2019s affirmative defense by demonstrating that the company\u2019s stated reasons for the challenged action are \u201ca pretext to mask discrimination.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b63-8\">In determining whether an employer\u2019s challenged conduct was unlawfully motivated, the Board may consider factors such as the employer\u2019s anti-union animus, the disparate treatment of the employee subject to the adverse treatment, the implausibility or unlikelihood of the employer\u2019s stated reason, the timing of the challenged conduct, and the employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>er\u2019s deviation from past practice. <em>See J. Coty Messenger Serv., Inc., </em>763 F.2d at 98; <em>NLRB v. Porta Sys. Corp., </em>625 F.2d 399, 403-04 (2d Cir.1980); <em>NLRB v. Long Island Airport Limousine Serv. Corp., </em>468 F.2d 292, 295-96 (2d Cir. 1972). Further, the Board may rely on circumstantial evidence to determine that a company\u2019s challenged employment decision was motivated by discriminatory animus. <em>See Long Island Airport Limousine Serv. Corp., </em>468 F.2d at 295.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-4\">The Board\u2019s finding that Bronson\u2019s decision to deny Tyree overtime hours was motivated by her involvement in the Union\u2019s activities at the plant is substantially supported by the record. Tyree\u2019s testimony that Blancato asked her to not have employees sign authorization cards during company time demonstrates that the Company was aware of Tyree\u2019s involvement with the Union. The timing of the denial \u2014 shortly after she attended an October 2000 off-site union meeting \u2014 and a plant manager\u2019s instruction to Tyree\u2019s supervisor that Tyree and another employee involved in the organizing campaign were no longer to receive overtime hours support the finding that the decision was improperly motivated. Further, Bronson\u2019s conclusory statement that it could no longer allow Tyree to work overtime diming the week if she would not work overtime on Saturdays is entirely unsupported by the record, and it is contradicted by Tyree\u2019s testimony that she observed other first shift employees working overtime hours on the hinge line when she arrived for the regularly scheduled beginning of her shift. Tyree testified that she had first declined Saturday overtime in April or May 2000 and had been permitted to continue working overtime hours during the week until after she attended the off-site meeting. This testimony was supported by her payroll records, which were introduced as evidence at the hearing conducted by the ALJ. Accordingly, the Board\u2019s petition for enforcement is GRANTED with respect to this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b64-6\">Likewise, the record and evidence substantially support the Board\u2019s finding that Bronson violated the Act when in November 2000 it declined to provide Pimentel with light-duty work to accommodate a back injury. It is not disputed that Blancato was aware that Pimentel was active in the organizing campaign\u2014 Blancato spoke with Pimentel about Blancato\u2019s opposition to the Union, and Pimentel was among the group of employees who attempted to present Blancato with a letter requesting representation by the Union. The timing of the refusal to accommodate Pimentel\u2019s request for light duty \u2014 the day after the Union and the Company entered into a stipulated election agreement \u2014 suggests that the refusal was motivated by a discriminatory animus. Further, Bronson\u2019s reliance on its previous accommodations of Pimentel\u2019s light-duty work as evidence that it was not motivated by improper animus in denying him light-duty work in November 2000 is undermined by the plant manager\u2019s testimony that it was Bronson\u2019s policy to accommodate its employees work restrictions and that restrictions were easily accommodated because there was a variety of easy work available to employees. Although the plant manager testified that he discussed the work limitation with Human Resources Manager Cindy Murphy and Blancato, no other evidence in the record supported that testimony. Moreover, multiple employees testified that they had previously seen Pimentel both stand and sit while performing his assembly work, and Pimentel testified that he had told the plant manager that he could work within the restrictions while performing the job already assigned to him.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"39\">*39</page-number>Further, to the extent that Bronson argues that the ALJ improperly credited the testimony of Pimentel and other employees over a supervisor\u2019s testimony that Pimentel would have been unable to adjust the height of his work table and would have been uncomfortable standing while working, this argument presents no basis to overturn the credibility determination. Bronson\u2019s argument relies only on a contrary view of the hearing evidence, without offering any basis upon which this Court might determine that the ALJ\u2019s credibility determination is either error or flatly contradicted by undisputed testimony. Although Bronson argues that a previous work restriction required Pimentel to \u201cstay off of his feet,\u201d other doctor\u2019s notes in the record imposed no such limitation. Accordingly, the Board\u2019s petition is GRANTED with respect to this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-5\">Further, the record and evidence substantially support the Board\u2019s finding that Bronson violated the Act when it terminated Pimentel in June 2001. Bronson argues that it reasonably concluded that Pimentel had abandoned his job after Company representatives learned that Pimentel was working at a different factory. However, the record demonstrates that Pimentel sought work elsewhere because Bronson\u2019s plant manager had told him not to return to work until he could work without restrictions. Further, when Pimentel came to the Company\u2019s facility after receiving the June 2001 letter terminating his benefits, he told Blancato that he had not abandoned his position, and he asked Blancato whether he still had a job with the Company. Blancato told Pimentel that he no longer had a position with Bronson. Blancato\u2019s response, despite Pimentel\u2019s insistence that he had not abandoned his job, supports the Board\u2019s conclusion that Bronson terminated Pimentel on the basis of his union activities. Accordingly, the petition for enforcement is GRANTED with respect to the finding that Bronson violated the Act when it terminated Pimentel in June 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b65-7\">Finally, Bronson argues that the NLRB erroneously imposed the unnecessary remedy of requiring Blancato to read the Board\u2019s Notice to Employees out loud to employees during mandatory meetings because the Company\u2019s conduct had not been egregious enough to merit such a remedy. This Court has noted that, \u201c[i]n recognition of the Board\u2019s expertise in interpreting and applying the Act, our review of [the Board\u2019s] orders is highly deferential.\u201d <em>NLRB v. Yonkers Assoc., </em>416 F.3d 119, 121 (2d Cir.2005). Thus, an NLRB order is \u201csubject to limited judicial review, and will not be overturned if it may fairly be said to have as its purpose ends that will effectuate the policies of the Act.\u201d <em>Elec. Contractors, Inc. v. NLRB, </em>245 F.3d 109, 122 (2d Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). \u201c[T]he policies of the Act are essentially remedial, and as such, must compensate for the injury actually suffered by the employees.\u201d <em>Katz\u2019s Delicatessen, Inc., </em>80 F.3d at 769 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b65-8\">The record in this case demonstrates that the portion of the order directing the public reading of the notice was well within the Board\u2019s remedial authority. The unfair labor practice that affected the largest number of employees \u2014 the threats of closure and termination \u2014 occurred in several mandatory \u201ccaptive audience\u201d employee meetings conducted by Blancato and Spencer. The mandatory nature of those meetings, at which Bronson officers were free to express their opposition to the Union, contributed to the effect of the violation and enforced the improper threat of job loss and plant closing. Requiring a company official to read the notice to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"40\">*40</page-number>Bronson\u2019s employees will serve to make the Board\u2019s corrective measures as pronounced as the improper threats were, and will eliminate any doubt regarding the impropriety of Spencer\u2019s and Blancato\u2019s behaviors.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b66-4\">For the reasons stated above, the petition of the National Labor Relations Board is GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b66-14\">. In this regard, the Company has noted in its brief that Blancato is no longer employed by Bronson. Accordingly, while we affirm the nature of the remedy, the NLRB is directed to modify its Order to require a Bronson officer or, perhaps most appropriately, Blancato\u2019s replacement, to read the notice to the employees.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
