Brown argues that the defendants, the Louisiana Department of Public Safety and Corrections (the Department) and Richard Stalder, have erroneously classified him as a fourth felony offender, a determination which has rendered him ineligible for parole. The Louisiana Supreme Court, however, has held that the Department is not bound by a court\u2019s habitual offender adjudication in calculating parole eligibility. <em>Townley v. Dep\u2019t of Public Safety &amp; Corr., </em>681 So.2d 951, 953 (La. 1996). Because Brown\u2019s civil rights action is factually frivolous, the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed. <em>See Bickford v. Int\u2019l Speedway Corp., </em>654 F.2d 1028, 1031 (5th Cir.1981). We warn Brown that our affirmance of the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint counts as one strike under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g) and that, if he accumulates three strikes, he will not be able to proceed in forma pauperis in any civil action or appeal filed while he is incarcerated or detained in any facility unless he is under imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See Adepegba v. Hammons, </em>103 F.3d 383, 388 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b427-7\">AFFIRMED; SANCTION WARNING ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b427-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
