Principi, </em>03-419, 19 Vet.App. 161 (Dec. 23, 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b891-9\">The Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals determined that new and material evidence had not been presented to reopen Sallyann P. Kolde\u2019s claims for service connection for generalized arthritis and for bursitis of the knees and legs. The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims vacated the Board\u2019s decision with respect to the arthritis and bursitis claim and remanded.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b891-10\">This case was stayed pending the court\u2019s disposition in <em>Roan v. Principi, </em>2004-7093, which was stayed pending the court\u2019s disposition in <em>Sanders v. Nicholson, </em>487 F.3d 881 (Fed.Cir.2007), and its companion case <em>Simmons v. Nicholson, </em>487 F.3d 892 (Fed. Cir.2007). In <em>Sanders, </em>this court held that any 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5103(a) error should be presumed prejudicial and the Secretary has the burden of rebutting this presumption. <em>Id. </em>at 891.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-11\">The court agrees that summary affirmance of the judgment vacating in part and remanding to the Board is appropriate in light of our decisions in <em>Simmons </em>and <em>Sanders.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b891-12\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b891-14\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b891-15\">(1) The stay of proceedings is lifted.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-16\">(2) The judgment of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims is summarily affirmed. The case is remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b891-17\">(3) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b891-13\"> The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims determined that Kolde's claim for service connection for obesity was abandoned.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
