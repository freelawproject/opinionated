The sole issue before the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) was the proper calculation of Nelson\u2019s average weekly wage (AWW) and the resulting compensation rate. The ALJ determined, pursuant to 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 910(c), Nelson\u2019s AWW to be $424.00; the Benefits Review Board (BRB) affirmed. Petitioner contends: the ALJ erred in its AWW calculation because it was based solely on Nelson\u2019s salary earned during his brief employment with Petitioner.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-7\">Under the LHWCA, the BRB is required to accept the ALJ\u2019s findings of fact and conclusions of law supported by substantial evidence and in accordance with the law. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(b)(3). BRB decisions are reviewed \u201cto determine whether it has adhered to its proper scope of review\u201d. <em>Gulf Best Elec., Inc. v. Methe, </em>396 F.3d 601, 603 (5th Cir.2004) (citing <em>H.B. Zachry Co. v. Quinones, </em>206 F.3d 474, 477 (5th Cir.2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-8\">The LHWCA provides three alternative methods of calculating AWW. <em>See </em>33 U.S.C. \u00a7 910(a)-(c). Neither party disputes the ALJ correctly applied subsection 10(c), the third method. That section applies \u201cwhen the first two methods cannot reasonably and fairly be applied\u201d. <em>Hall v. Consol. Employment Sys., Inc., </em>139 F.3d 1025, 1030 (5th Cir.1998) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-11\">Unlike subsections 10(a) and (b), there is no time limit imposed for determining AWW under section 10(c). <em>Id. </em>\u201cThe essential purpose of the average weekly wage determination is to reflect \u2018a claimant\u2019s annual earning capacity <em>at the time of the injury.\u2019 \u201d Id. </em>at 1031 (quoting <em>Empire United Stevedores v. Gatlin, </em>936 F.2d 819, 823 (5th Cir.1991)) (emphasis in original). In so deciding, the ALJ has broad discretion in deciding what reflects the earning capacity of the injured worker. <em>Gatlin, </em>936 F.2d at 823. For example, our court has upheld an AWW determination where the ALJ excluded all of the claimant\u2019s wages at the time of his injury. <em>See Hall, </em>139 F.3d at 1030.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-12\">Here, the opposite situation exists. The ALJ relied exclusively upon Nelson\u2019s employment at the time of his injury, concluding that an AWW based on Nelson\u2019s previous year\u2019s earnings would lead to a harsh result. Under the substantial evidence standard, \u201cwe may not substitute our judgment for that of the ALJ, nor may we reweigh or reappraise the evidence\u201d. <em>Hall, </em>139 F.3d at 1031 (internal citation and quotation marks omitted). \u201cOur focus is strictly confined to whether there exists evidence that \u2018a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1032 (quoting <em>Pierce v. Underwood, </em>487 U.S. 552, 565, 108 S.Ct. 2541, 101 L.Ed.2d 490 (1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-13\">The ALJ reasonably concluded that Nelson\u2019s salary at the time of the incident, regardless of the extremely short duration of his employment, best indicated his earning capacity. Therefore, the ALJ\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>and is in accordance with the plain language of section 10(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b397-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
