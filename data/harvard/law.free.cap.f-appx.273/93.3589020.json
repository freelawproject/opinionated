Kevin Castel, United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b120-5\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b120-6\">Defendant-appellant Roberto DeJesus Rosario-Veloz pled guilty to one count of violating 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(2) by entering the United States unlawfully following his deportation after a conviction for an aggravated felony. Based on his offense of conviction and past criminal history, Rosario-Veloz faced a statutory maximum sentence of twenty years\u2019 imprisonment and a U.S. Sentencing Guidelines-recommended range of fifty-seven to seventy-one months\u2019 imprisonment. The District Court sentenced him principally to sixty months\u2019 imprisonment. He now appeals his sentence only. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and the procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-7\">Rosario-Veloz challenges the sentence imposed upon him based upon the availability of lower sentences in \u201cfast-track\u201d districts. Specifically, he contends that the existence of \u201cfast-track\u201d programs in certain federal districts \u2014 though not the Southern District of New York \u2014 creates \u201cunwarranted sentence disparities\u201d among defendants convicted of the same crime in different districts, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(6). He also contends that the District Court\u2019s refusal to consider these disparities when crafting an appropriate sentence violated the principle of parsimony set forth in \u00a7 3553(a) (requiring the sentence imposed to be \u201csufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comply with the purposes set forth in [\u00a7 3553(a)(2) ]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b120-11\">Both of Rosario-Veloz\u2019s arguments are unavailing in light of the case law of our Circuit. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Hendry, </em>522 F.3d 239 (2d Cir.2008). Rosario-Veloz\u2019s first claim is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Mejia, </em>461 F.3d 158 (2d Cir.2006), where we concluded that a \u201cdistrict court\u2019s refusal to adjust a sentence to compensate for the absence of a fast-track program does not make a sentence unreasonable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 164. His second claim is foreclosed by <em>Hendry </em>and <em>United States v. Ministro-Tapia, </em>470 F.3d 137(2d Cir.2006). As we observed in <em>Ministro-Tapia,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b120-12\">\u201c[f]or us to hold that a sentence at the bottom of the Guidelines range is invalid under the parsimony clause, we will require a showing ... of the district court\u2019s belief that, after taking into account the Guidelines and the \u2018considered judgment\u2019 that they represent, a lower sentence would be equally effective in advancing the purposes set forth in \u00a7 3553(a)(2).\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b120-13\"><em>Id. </em>at 142 (citation omitted). Rosario-Veloz\u2019s parsimony argument also fails in light of our observation, in <em>Hendry, </em>that defendants in \u201cfast-track\u201d and \u201cnon-fast-track\u201d jurisdictions are not \u201csimilarly situated,\u201d 522 F.3d at 242.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-14\">The record provides no indication that the District Court considered the sentence it imposed on Rosario-Veloz to be greater than necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-15\">We therefore AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
