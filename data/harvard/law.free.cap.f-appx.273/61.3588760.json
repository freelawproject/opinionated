Nevas, of the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b87-20\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b87-21\">Plaintiff-Appellant Donald Mac Pherson (\u201cMac Pherson\u201d) instituted this action against Defendant-Appellee State Street Bank and Trust Company (\u201cState Street\u201d) after State Street and its attorney allegedly committed fraud upon a state trial court, resulting in the wrongful issuance of an order for service by publication, followed by the entry of a judgment by default terminating Mac Pherson\u2019s interest in his real property. Mac Pherson now appeals from an order of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York (Hurley, <em>J.) </em>dismissing, on <em>res judicata </em>grounds, his claims brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and section 439 of the New York General Business Law. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts of the case, its procedural history, and the scope of the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-22\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s application of the principle of <em>res judicata, </em>\u201caccepting all factual findings of the district court unless clearly erroneous.\u201d <em>Computer Assocs. Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Altai, Inc., </em>126 F.3d 365, 368-69 (2d Cir.1997). \u201cTo prove that a claim is precluded under this doctrine, \u2018a party must show that (1) the previous action involved an adjudication on the merits; (2) the previous action involved the [parties] or those in privity -with them; [and] (3) the claims asserted in the subsequent action were, or could have been, raised in the prior action.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pike v. Freeman, </em>266 F.3d 78, 91 (2d Cir.2001) (alterations in original) (quoting <em>Monahan v. N.Y. City Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>214 F.3d 275, 284-85 (2d Cir.2000)).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"62\">*62</page-number>The first and second prongs of this framework are not in dispute; this case turns on the third prong. We are obligated to accord a New York state court judgment the preclusive effect that would be given it by the New York courts, <em>Brooks v. Giuliani, </em>84 F.3d 1454, 1463 (2d Cir.1996), and \u201cNew York law has adopted a \u2018transactional approach\u2019 \u201d to this third prong, <em>McKithen v. Brown, </em>481 F.3d 89, 104 (2d Cir.2007). \u201cWhether a claim that was not raised in the previous action could have been raised therein\u201d depends on \u201c \u2018whether the same transaction or connected series of transactions is at issue, and whether the same evidence is needed to support both claims.\u2019 \u201d <em>Pike, </em>266 F.3d at 91 (quoting <em>Interoceanica Corp. v. Sound Pilots, Inc., </em>107 F.3d 86, 90 (2d Cir.1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">We have no doubt that this action and the state court action spring from the same transaction or claim. Mac Pherson expressly argued to the state trial court, and subsequently to the Appellate Division, that the Order for Service by Publication was predicated on a misrepresentation of material fact, that sustaining jurisdiction over him based on publication would be a denial of his constitutional right to due process, that procedural due process requires notice reasonably calculated to apprise interested parties of the pendency of an action affecting a person\u2019s property interest, and that the state court should have ordered a hearing to determine whether service by other means was available before ordering service by publication. Accordingly, <em>res judicata </em>applies to preclude Mac Pherson from asserting in federal court the claims he has raised in this action.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Brooks, </em>84 F.3d at 1463 (holding that the plaintiffs\u2019 due process claims were \u201ccompletely barred by <em>res judicata, </em>because the underlying factual predicate for each of these claims ... is substantially identical to the allegations presented in state court\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">We have considered all of Mac Pherson\u2019s arguments, and we find them without merit. Accordingly, the judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b88-5\">. Before us, Mac Pherson raises for the first time a claim of violation of Equal Protection of Laws. He asserts that his \"inability to litigate the 'due process claim\u2019 before the New York Court of Appeals ... constituted an \u2018equal protection\u2019 violation since the ability to present such a claim to the New York Court of Appeals is available to those persons who raised the issue in the context of a motion to dismiss prior to the entry of judgment,\u201d but not to those in his situation, who were forced to assert their due process claims in a motion to vacate the judgment. He also raises for the first time a claim that New York CPLR \u00a7 308(5) is facially unconstitutional because it lacks clear standards for determining \"impracticability.\u201d As Mac Pherson did not raise these argument in his Complaint or otherwise advance them before the District Court, we do not consider them. <em>See Kraebel v. N.Y. City Dep\u2019t of Housing Preservation &amp; Dev., </em>959 F.2d 395, 401 (2d Cir.1992) (\u201cWe have repeatedly held that if an argument has not been raised before the district court, we will not consider it....\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
