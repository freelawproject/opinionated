After examining the briefs and the record, we have concluded that oral argument is unnecessary. See Fed. R.App. P. 34(a); Cir. R. 34(f).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b578-19\">Order</p>\n<p id=\"b578-20\">Our initial decision in this case, 215 F.3d 776 (7th Cir.2000), affirmed Williams\u2019s conviction but remanded for resentencing within the range of 360 months to life. The district court chose 360 months, the lowest available. Williams did not appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b578-21\">In this collateral proceeding under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, Williams accuses his lawyer of ineffective assistance for failing to appeal at his request. The district court denied relief without an evidentiary hearing, ruling that an appeal would have been pointless. In this court the United States has confessed error, and properly so. The district judge may well be right that an appeal would have been pointless, but under <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 264, 87 S.Ct. 1032, 18 L.Ed.2d 40 (1967), the decision whether a given appeal is frivolous is made by the court of appeals, not the defense lawyer or the district judge. That\u2019s why the Supreme Court held in <em>Roe v. Flores-Ortega, </em>528 U.S. 470, 483, 120 S.Ct. 1029, 145 L.Ed.2d 985 (2000), that failure to take an appeal at a defendant\u2019s timely request is ineffective assistance without regard to the district judge\u2019s as<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>sessment of prejudice (or lack thereof) caused by the omission. See also <em>Castellanos v. United States, </em>26 F.3d 717 (7th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b579-5\">It remains to be determined whether Williams asked his lawyer to file a notice of appeal. The judgment of the district court is vacated, and the case is remanded for an evidentiary hearing devoted to that question. If Williams told his lawyer to file a notice of appeal, then a new judgment must be entered from which an appeal may be filed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
