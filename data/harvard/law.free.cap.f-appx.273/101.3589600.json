We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-9\">On appeal, McEwen contends that the agency improperly denied him a continuance to pursue his pending application for adjustment of status. An IJ has discretion to grant a continuance \u201cfor good cause shown.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.29. Accordingly, we review the decision to deny a eontinuance \u201c \u2018under a highly deferential standard of abuse of discretion.\u2019 \u201d <em>Elbahja v. Keisler, </em>505 F.3d 125, 128 (2d Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Morgan v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 549, 551 (2d Cir.2006)). Under this standard, we will uphold an IJ\u2019s denial of a continuance unless \u201c(1) his decision rests on an error of law (such as application of the wrong legal principle) or a clearly erroneous factual finding or (2) his decision \u2014 though not necessarily the product of a legal error or a clearly erroneous factual finding \u2014 cannot be located within the range of permissible decisions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Morgan, </em>445 F.3d at 551-52 (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b128-14\">McEwen claims that the agency based its denial of a continuance on the existence of federal regulations granting the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service (\u201cUCIS\u201d) exclusive authority to adjudicate application for adjustment of status made by \u201carriving aliens who have been paroled and placed in removal proceedings,\u201d Eligibility of Arriving Aliens in Removal Proceedings To Apply for Adjustment of Status and Jurisdiction To Adjudicate Applications for Adjustment of Status, 71 Fed Reg. 27,585 at 27,587 (May 12, 2006) (codified in scattered sections of 8 C.F.R.). Review of the record, however, belies this claim. McEwen, who was represented by counsel, did not request a continuance at his August 30, 2005 merits hearing before the IJ. The IJ denied McEwen\u2019s applications for relief on grounds other than jurisdiction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Finally, the BIA, while noting the existence and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>effect of the regulation in question, rejected McEwen\u2019s appeal after determining that, \u201c[bjased upon [the BIA\u2019s] review of the record,\u201d McEwen had failed to establish \u201c \u2018good cause\u2019 for a further continuance\u201d of his removal proceedings. <em>In re Clarence McEwen </em>(BIA Feb. 6, 2007); <em>cf. Gao Ni v. Board, of Immigration Appeals, </em>520 F.3d 125, 130 (2d Cir.2008) (holding that the BIA should have considered whether the facts of the petitioners\u2019 cases \u201cwarranted a favorable exercise of its discretion\u201d before denying them motions to reopen them removal proceedings based on the regulation at issue here).</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">Review of the record reveals no error by the agency \u2014 let alone any abuse of discretion. Accordingly, because we have considered all of McEwen\u2019s arguments and found them to be without merit, McEwen\u2019s petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, Singh\u2019s pending motion for a stay of removal is DISMISSED as moot</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b128-12\">. As the record reveals, the IJ denied McEwen\u2019s application for adjustment of status on the basis that, because McEwen lacked an approved visa petition, he was not eligible for adjustment of status relief. The IJ denied McEwen's application for cancellation of removal based on the determination that McEwen had failed to establish that his removal \"would create an <em>exceptional and extremely unusual hardship </em>to his U.S. citizen son or his U.S. citizen wife.\u201d Appendix 32.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
