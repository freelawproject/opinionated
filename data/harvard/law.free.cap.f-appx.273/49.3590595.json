Page denying Jiang\u2019s application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Xiu Ru Jiang, </em>No. A 74 333 625 (B.I.A. June 28, 2005), <em>affg </em>Nos. A 74 333 625, A 74 333 626, A 74 333 627 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City, June 30, 2004). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-11\">When the BIA summarily affirms the decision of the IJ without issuing an opinion, <em>see </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.1(e)(4), this Court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency determination. <em>See, e.g., Twum v. INS, </em>411 F.3d 54, 58 (2d Cir.2005). Here, the IJ stated at the outset of his decision that he was \u201cincorporating by reference\u201d his initial decision. In the earlier decision, the IJ found that, even assuming that Jiang had been sterilized and had undergone an abortion, she had not established that those procedures were \u201cforcibly done,\u201d pointing to several discrepancies in her testimony. The IJ emphasized that Jiang had not produced her husband as a witness to corroborate her claims. In 2002, the BIA declined to adopt the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding \u2014 instead finding that Jiang failed to meet her burden of proof\u2014 and that decision was never vacated. As such, we construe the IJ\u2019s intent to \u201cincorporate by reference\u201d his initial decision, as finding that the deficiencies in Jiang\u2019s testimony warranted corroboration from her husband, Yang-Shun Chen, in order for her to establish that her sterilization and abortion were forced so as to render her eligible for relief under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42). On remand, the IJ expressed \u201cdoubts\u201d about Chen\u2019s testimony due to \u201ca number of major discrepancies,\u201d although he did not explicitly find that Chen lacked credibility. Thus, we review only the IJ\u2019s determination that, based on her husband\u2019s testimony, Jiang failed to meet her burden of demonstrating that she suffered a forced abortion or sterilization. <em>See Twum, </em>411 F.3d at 59.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-12\">This Court reviews the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"51\">*51</page-number>standard, and treats them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 305 (2d Cir.2007). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005). We reviews <em>de novo </em>questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See, e.g., Secaidar-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">As a preliminary matter, the Government\u2019s assertion that Jiang waived any challenge to the IJ\u2019s finding that she did not meet her burden of proof is unavailing. The Government correctly notes that, in her brief to this Court, Jiang has challenged the IJ\u2019s decision as though it was based on an adverse credibility finding. In doing so, Jiang nevertheless addressed each of the findings upon which the IJ\u2019s decision was based, albeit in terms of credibility. As such, we construe her arguments on appeal as having meaningfully challenged the IJ\u2019s burden of proof finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">We conclude that the record supports the IJ\u2019s finding that Jiang failed to meet her burden of proof. Even assuming that Jiang credibly established that she underwent sterilization and an abortion, the IJ reasonably found that she failed to demonstrate that those procedures were \u201cforcibly done.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">On remand, Jiang offered the testimony of her husband Chen to corroborate her claims. The IJ accurately noted, however, that Chen\u2019s testimony raised more questions than it answered. Chen had testified in his own 1992 asylum application hearing that Jiang was sterilized in 1984, but testified at the hearing on remand that she was sterilized in 1986. The IJ appropriately declined to credit Chen\u2019s explanation that he \u201cmade a mistake\u201d at his earlier hearing, when he specifically clarified at that time that the sterilization occurred shortly after the birth of his second child in 1984. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 80-81 (2d Cir.2005) (emphasizing that the agency need not credit an applicant\u2019s explanations for inconsistent testimony unless those explanations would compel a reasonable fact-finder to do so).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-9\">Similarly, the IJ correctly observed that Chen omitted from his testimony at his 1992 hearing any mention of Jiang\u2019s abortion. The IJ reasonably rejected Chen\u2019s explanations for the omission, when he testified variously that he thought \u201cabortion and sterilization [were] the same,\u201d he \u201cdidn\u2019t remember,\u201d and \u201cthey didn\u2019t ask\u201d whether an abortion had occurred. <em>See id. </em>Likewise, the IJ accurately identified an inconsistency between Chen\u2019s testimony that he saw Jiang in China in October 1989, and Jiang\u2019s testimony that, following the forcible sterilization, she did not see Chen again until her arrival in the United States. The IJ was not obliged to accept Chen\u2019s explanation for this discrepancy\u2014 that Jiang made a mistake because something happened to her brain after she was sterilized. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b77-10\">In light of the discrepancies and omissions identified, the IJ appropriately declined to give weight to Chen\u2019s testimony. <em>See Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 341-42 (2d Cir.2006). Thus, the IJ reasonably concluded that Jiang failed to meet her burden of establishing that her sterilization and abortion were forced. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42). As such, the IJ\u2019s denial of asylum was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-11\">Because Jiang was unable to show the objective likelihood of persecution needed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"52\">*52</page-number>to make out an asylum claim, she was necessarily unable to meet the higher standard required to succeed on her claims for withholding of removal and relief under the CAT, which rested on the same factual predicate. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
