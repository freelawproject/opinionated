Jackson (\u201cJackson\u201d) was ticketed on the Natchez Trace Parkway by United States Park Service Ranger Jerome Timmons on November 5, 2005, for operating a motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol. <em>See </em>36 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.23(a)(2) (stating that operation of a motor vehicle is \u201cprohibited while ... the alcohol concen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>tration in the operator\u2019s ... breath is 0.08 grams or more of alcohol ... per 210 liters of breath\u201d). Jackson pleaded not guilty to this offense and proceeded to trial before a magistrate judge (\u201cMJ\u201d). The government\u2019s case relied on the testimony of Ranger Timmons and the results of a breathalyzer test conducted by Timmons using an Intoxilyzer 8000 machine, which showed Jackson\u2019s breath alcohol level to be above the legal limit. Jackson did not move to exclude the Intoxilyzer\u2019s test results. At the close of the government\u2019s evidence, Jackson moved for acquittal under Rule 29. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Crim.P. 29. Jackson did not present any evidence of his own at trial. Jackson argued that the Intoxilyzer results, and Ranger Timmons\u2019 testimony were not sufficient to establish his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. The MJ denied the motion and found Jackson guilty based solely on the results of the Intoxilyzer, and the testimony of Ranger Timmons related to the Intoxilyzer testing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Jackson appealed his conviction to the district court. The district court affirmed, applying the same standard we apply here. <em>See United States v. Jackson, </em>470 F.Supp.2d 654 (S.D.Miss.2007). Jackson now appeals the district court\u2019s judgment, arguing again that the test results and Ranger Timmons\u2019 testimony regarding the Intoxilyzer are insufficient to support his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Jackson moved for acquittal at the close of the government\u2019s evidence, which was the close of all evidence. In this circumstance, we review a sufficiency challenge <em>de novo, </em>asking whether a rational trier of fact \u201ccould have found the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>United States v. Mitchell, </em>484 F.3d 762, 768 (5th Cir.2007); see <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979). \u201cThe evidence ... must be considered in the light most favorable to the government, giving the government the benefit of all reasonable inferences and credibility choices.\u201d <em>United States v. Inocencio, </em>40 F.3d 716, 724 (5th Cir.1994). \u201cIt is not necessary that the evidence exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence.\u201d <em>United States v. Espinoza-Seanez, </em>862 F.2d 526, 536 (5th Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">Under 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.23(a)(2), the government must prove that Jackson was operating a motor vehicle while his breath alcohol concentration was 0.08 grams or more of alcohol per 210 liters of breath. The regulation further states that tests done for the presence of alcohol \u201cshall be determined by and administered at the direction of an authorized person.\u201d 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.23(c)(3). \u201cAny test shall be conducted by using accepted scientific methods and equipment of proven accuracy and reliability operated by personnel certified in its use.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at (c)(4). Ranger Timmons testified that he received formal training in the operation of the Intoxilyzer 8000 and that he had been administering tests using the machine for approximately eight months. Timmons testified that a Mississippi State Trooper manually checks the machines used by the Park Rangers on a monthly basis. Timmons also testified that the Intoxilyzer 8000 contains a self-calibration check which runs before and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>after each breathalyzer test is administered. According to Timmons\u2019 testimony, this is an improvement over the 5000-model which required manual calibration. If the Intoxilyzer detects an error during the self-calibration check, the machine will not function. Timmons testified that the Intoxilyzer 8000 performed the self-calibration checks and functioned as expected when he tested Jackson\u2019s breath alcohol content. Consistent with standard operating procedure, Ranger Timmons was required to wait twenty five minutes before testing Jackson \u2014 the machine is pre-programmed to require this observation time before it will allow an officer to administer the test. Timmons had Jackson blow twice on the Intoxylizer. Jackson\u2019s first breath sample registered 0.099, and his second 0.084, both above the legal limit.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-4\">On cross-examination, Timmons admitted that during his training he was told that the Intoxilyzer had a margin of error, but he could not recall the margin of error. He also stated that he was not aware of the last time that his machine was checked by a State Trooper, although the norm was once a month. On appeal, Jackson argues that Timmons\u2019 lack of knowledge as to the last manual calibration of his machine, and his lack of knowledge concerning the Intoxilyzer\u2019s margin of error, sufficiently undermine the reliability of the Intoxilyzer results such that a rational fact finder would have a reasonable doubt as to Jackson\u2019s guilt.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-5\">Based on the evidence at Jackson\u2019s trial, we affirm his conviction. Timmons\u2019 testimony established that he was \u201cauthorized\u201d and \u201ccertified\u201d to operate the Intoxilyzer 8000. 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.23(c)(3) and (4). The test results admitted at trial were the result of \u201caccepted scientific methods and equipment of proven accuracy and reliability.\u201d 36 C.F.R. \u00a7 4.23(c)(4); <em>see, e.g., California v. Trombetta, </em>467 U.S. 479, 489 n. 9, 104 S.Ct. 2528, 81 L.Ed.2d 413 (1984) (recognizing that accuracy of Intoxilyzer has been certified by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration); <em>United States v. Brannon, </em>146 F.3d 1194, 1196 (9th Cir.1998) (same); <em>United States v. Reid, </em>929 F.2d 990, 994 (4th Cir.1991) (stating that breathalyzer is the \u201cbest means for obtaining evidence of the breath alcohol content\u201d); <em>Volk v. United States, </em>57 F.Supp.2d 888, 897 (N.D.Cal.1999) (\u201cThe methodology of the Intoxilyzer has achieved wide acceptance within the scientific community.\u201d). Timmons\u2019 testimony established that the Intoxilyzer 8000 runs automatic calibration checks before and after each test, disabling the machine if anything is wrong, and that the machines used by the Park Rangers were manually checked on a monthly basis by the Mississippi State Troopers. Both breath samples provided by Jackson registered levels above the legal limit. The evidence produced at Jackson\u2019s trial, when taken in the light most favorable to the verdict, provides the necessary support for a rational trier of fact to find Jackson guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Timmons\u2019 inability to recall the machine\u2019s specific margin of error, or the time when his particular machine was last manually checked do not lead us to overturn the verdict reached by the magistrate judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b400-7\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b398-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b399-6\">. Ranger Timmons also testified as to his observations when Jackson exited his vehicle and testified as to Jackson's failure to satisfactorily complete field sobriety tests. According to Timmons, these confirmed his belief that Jackson was intoxicated. Jackson also admitted to consuming a quart of \"King Cobra\u201d within the preceding five hours, and to having \"a few sips\u201d of alcohol from the open container that his wife had in the vehicle. However, the MJ did not consider Timmons' observations in finding Jackson guilty. Instead, the MJ stated that he would rely solely on the testimony concerning the Intoxilyzer test and its results in determining Jackson\u2019s guilt.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
