Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, </em>106 M.S.P.R. 425 (2007). Because the Board\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence, we <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b984-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>In June 2005, Perkins and the agency entered into a settlement agreement to resolve Perkins\u2019s individual right of action. Shortly thereafter, Perkins filed a petition for review, which was forwarded to a field office for processing as a petition for enforcement. Finding partial noncompliance, the Board granted the petition for enforcement in part and ordered the agency to comply with the settlement agreement. <em>Perkins v. Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, </em>105 M.S.P.R. 289 (2007). Perkins subsequently filed another petition for enforcement, subject of the current petition for review, arguing that the agency remained in breach of the settlement agreement in several respects.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-4\">First, Perkins argued that the agency failed to fully compensate him for overtime and holiday pay. The Board found that the agency \u201cha[d] produced relevant, material evidence showing that it ha[d] paid [Perkins] the applicable overtime and holiday pay and that [Perkins] ha[d] not met his burden of proving the agency breached the agreement.\u201d <em>Perkins, </em>106 M.S.P.R. at 428.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-5\">Second, he argued that the agency failed to pay him a cost-of-living allowance adjustment as provided in the settlement agreement. The Board, considering documentary evidence from the agency to the contrary, including an affidavit from a Supervisory Program Analyst, concluded that Perkins had not met his burden to demonstrate breach of this provision. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b984-6\">Third, Perkins contended that the agency failed to comply with a provision of the settlement agreement obligating it to submit his position description for \u201cthree classification reviews by three HR classifiers.\u201d Resp\u2019t App. at 15. Specifically, he argued that one of the classification reviews did not qualify because it was conducted by the agency\u2019s \u201cLead Human Resources Specialist,\u201d instead of someone entitled a \u201cclassifier.\u201d The Board disagreed, concluding that the agency had satisfied the provision. <em>See Perkins, </em>106 M.S.P.R. at 429 n. 4 (\u201c[T]he fact that their job titles do not include the word \u2018classifier\u2019 does not mean that they are unqualified to perform classification reviews.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b984-8\">Fourth, Perkins argued that another classification review did not qualify because of numerous errors, including reference to the grade of his position as \u201cWG,\u201d rather than \u201cWS.\u201d The Board determined that, despite the typographical errors, other information in the review \u2014 including two other instances in which the classification review correctly stated the position title \u2014 indicated that \u201cthe report [wa]s clearly a classification review of [Perkins\u2019s] [position description].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 429.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-9\">Perkins also substantively challenged this classification review, namely, the classifier\u2019s decision to not award points for \u201cSubfactor C,\u201d which includes the physical dispersion, work coordination, and the location of subordinate employees. The Board concluded that the agency did not breach the agreement, because \u201cwhile the settlement agreement entitled [Perkins] to three classification reviews by agency classifiers, there was no guarantee that he would agree with the analysis set forth in the reviews.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b984-10\">Finally, Perkins argued that the agency failed to submit his position description to the Department of the Interior and the Department of Defense for concurrence reviews as required by the settlement agreement. Before the Board, the agency submitted evidence that it made such requests and the responses it received in response to those requests. Accordingly, the Board found the agency in compliance with this portion of settlement agreement. <em>Id. </em>at 430.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>Having determined that the agency was in compliance with all provisions of the settlement agreement, the Board dismissed Perkins\u2019s petition for enforcement. <em>Id. </em>The current petition for review followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">Our scope of review of Board decisions is defined and limited by statute. <em>See </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c). \u201cThe agency\u2019s action in this case must be affirmed unless it is found to be: (1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Hayes v. Dep\u2019t of the Navy, </em>727 F.2d 1535, 1537 (Fed.Cir.1984). The petitioner carries the burden to prove breach of the settlement agreement, <em>see Tech. Assistance Int\u2019l, Inc. v. United States, </em>150 F.3d 1369, 1373 (Fed. Cir.1998), and in order to prevail, \u201cmust show material noncompliance by the agency with the terms of the settlement agreement,\u201d <em>Lutz v. U.S. Postal Serv., </em>485 F.3d 1377, 1381 (Fed.Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b985-6\">On appeal, Perkins essentially presents the same arguments he made before the Board and asks us to reweigh the Board\u2019s various factual determinations in his favor. \u201c[T]he evaluation of and weight to be given to ... [the] evidence in the record are judgment calls that rest primarily within the discretion of the Board.\u201d <em>Hall v. Dep\u2019t of the Treasury, </em>264 F.3d 1050, 1060 (Fed. Cir.2001). None of the arguments reiterated by Perkins warrants our overturning of the Board\u2019s conclusion that he failed to carry his burden to show breach of the settlement agreement. Specifically, Perkins fails to establish that the Board\u2019s decision was unsupported by substantial evidence or that the Board\u2019s conclusion that Perkins had not shown material noncompliance by the agency with the terms of the settlement agreement was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law. Because the Board\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence, and we otherwise discern no basis on which to overturn the decision, we must affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-8\">COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b985-9\">No costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
