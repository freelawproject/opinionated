James E. Goins has not responded.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-24\">This case was stayed pending the court\u2019s disposition in <em>Sanders v. Nicholson, </em>487 F.3d 881 (Fed.Cir.2007) and its companion case <em>Simmons v. Nicholson, </em>487 F.3d 892 (Fed.Cir.2007). In <em>Sanders, </em>this court held that any section 5103(a) error should be presumed prejudicial and the Secretary has the burden of rebutting this presumption. <em>Id. </em>at 891.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-25\">The Secretary asserts that the only issue raised in this appeal is identical to the issue decided in <em>Sanders. </em>Under these circumstances, the court agrees with the Secretary that it is proper to vacate the portion of the CAVC\u2019s decision regarding Goin\u2019s increased-rating claim for left forehead scar and remand for further proceedings consistent with <em>Sanders.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b949-26\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b949-27\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b949-28\">(1) The judgment of the CAVC is vacated to the extent noted above and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-29\">(3) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
