The district court ordered that the complaint be dismissed pursuant to the abstention doctrine of <em>Younger v. Harris, </em>401 U.S. 37, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971). It alternatively dismissed the claims for failure to state a claim and as frivolous, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1915A and 1915(e)(2), and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">On appeal, Reyna renews the merits of his claims and urges that abstention was not warranted under <em>Younger </em>because the murder charges against him were brought in bad faith and with the intent to harass him. He also raises numerous other new assertions regarding the various defendants in his appellate brief. However, he has abandoned by failing to brief any challenge to the district court\u2019s alternative bases for dismissal. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993). Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b424-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
