Brown filed a petition for a writ of mandamus with this Court, seeking an order compelling the District Court to act upon his \u00a7 2255 motion. Brown\u2019s mandamus petition was docketed on March 7, 2008.</p>\n<p id=\"b240-21\">Shortly before the mandamus petition was docketed, the District Court entered an order, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c) and by agreement of the parties, reducing Brown\u2019s sentence from 63 to 52 months and reflecting the District Court\u2019s intention that Brown should be released from custody that day. In response to a subsequent motion by the Government, on March 12, 2008, the District Court vacated the March 3, 2008 order and again reduced Brown\u2019s sentence, this time to time served. The record now reflects that Brown has been released</p>\n<p id=\"b240-22\">A writ of mandamus is a drastic remedy, which is \u201cseldom issued and its use is discouraged.\u201d <em>Lusardi v. Lechner, </em>855 F.2d 1062, 1069 (3d Cir.1988). Issuance of the writ is largely discretionary. <em>Hahnemann Univ. Hosp. v. Edgar, </em>74 F.3d 456 (3d Cir.1996). In light of the latest activity in the District Court action as well as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>his recent release, we are confident that, if Brown indicates a continued desire for \u00a7 2255 relief, the District Court will act upon Brown\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion, which remains outstanding on the District Court\u2019s docket. We will therefore deny the petition for mandamus.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
