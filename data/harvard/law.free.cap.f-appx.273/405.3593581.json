Perez Vela argues that the district court erred when it (1) departed upward pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3 based on the inadequacy of Perez-Vela\u2019s criminal history category and (2) imposed a 16-level enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(B)(1)(A)(ii) based on Perez-Vela\u2019s prior Texas conviction for burglary of a habitation. Perez-Vela also argues that the sentence-enhancement provisions of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b) are unconstitutional in light of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">Perez-Vela\u2019s 115-month sentence included an upward departure from criminal history category VI pursuant to \u00a7 4A1.3. Thus, Perez-Vela\u2019s sentence is a guideline sentence, which is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>440 F.3d 704, 707 (5th Cir.2006). The district court concluded that an upward departure was warranted because Perez-Vela\u2019s criminal history score underrepresented the seriousness of his criminal history or the likelihood that he would commit other crimes and further explained that the departure was justified by Perez-Vela\u2019s extensive criminal history, which included two felony convictions and eight misdemeanor convictions. <em>See United States v. Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d 345, 348 (5th Cir.2006). Furthermore, the extent of the district court\u2019s departure was not unreasonable given the nature of the instant offense and Perez-Vela\u2019s extensive criminal history. <em>See Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d at 347-48; <em>United States v. Smith, </em>417 F.3d 483, 492 (5th Cir.2005). Perez-Vela has not shown that the district court reversibly erred in imposing an upward departure or that the extent of the departure was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">Perez-Vela\u2019s challenge to his 16-level crime of violence enhancement is also unavailing. His Texas conviction for burglary of a habitation qualifies as an enumerated offense for purposes of the enhancement. <em>See United States v. Garcia-Mendez, </em>420 F.3d 454, 456-57 (5th Cir.2005). Notwithstanding his argument to the contrary, <em>James v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 1586, 167 L.Ed.2d 532 (2007), does not overrule this court\u2019s precedent on this issue. <em>See United States v. Gomez-Guerra, </em>485 F.3d 301, 303 &amp; n. 1 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 156, 169 L.Ed.2d 106 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-13\">In light of <em>Apprendi, </em>Perez-Vela challenges the constitutionality of \u00a7 1326(b)\u2019s treatment of prior felony and aggravated felony convictions as sentencing factors rather than elements of the offense that must be found by a jury. This argument is foreclosed by <em>Almendarez-Torres v. United States, </em>523 U.S. 224, 235, 118 S.Ct. 1219, 140 L.Ed.2d 350 (1998). <em>United States v. Pineda-Arrellano, </em>492 F.3d 624, 625 (5th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 872, 169 L.Ed.2d 737 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"APJ\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
