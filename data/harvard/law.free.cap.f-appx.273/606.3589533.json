After Defendants were convicted but before they were sentenced, we decided <em>United States v. Lopez, </em>484 F.3d 1186, 1191 (9th Cir.2007) (en banc), which clarified when the \u201cbringing to\u201d crime is completed. Because the jury instructions in Defendants\u2019 trial were drafted under <em>pre-Lopez </em>law, the district court granted Defendants\u2019 motion for a new trial but denied their motion for judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-10\">In Nos. 07-50386 and 07-05390, Defendants filed interlocutory appeals of the district court\u2019s denial of the motion for judgment of acquittal. In No. 07-74274, Defendants filed a petition for a writ of mandamus, seeking an order directing the district court to enter judgment of acquittal. We dismiss the appeals and deny mandamus relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-11\">1. We lack jurisdiction to entertain Defendants\u2019 interlocutory appeals because the double jeopardy claims are not \u201ccolor-able.\u201d <em>Richardson v. United States, </em>468 U.S. 317, 321-22, 104 S.Ct. 3081, 82 L.Ed.2d 242 (1984). Insufficiency of the evidence is not a colorable claim. <em>Id. </em>at 326 n. 6, 104 S.Ct. 3081; <em>United States v. Schemenauer, </em>394 F.3d 746, 750 (9th Cir. 2005). The exception for prosecutorial misconduct recognized in <em>Oregon v. Kennedy, </em>456 U.S. 667, 679, 102 S.Ct. 2083, 72 L.Ed.2d 416 (1982), does not apply. Defendants\u2019 claim of judicial or prosecutorial misconduct is not colorable. The government permissibly relied on existing law and read the precedents in a plausible manner. Accordingly, the appeals must be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-16\">2. Under <em>Bauman v. U.S. District Court, </em>557 F.2d 650, 654-55 (9th Cir.1977), there was no clear error of law. <em>See Gallo v. U.S. Dist. Court, </em>349 F.3d 1169, 1177 (9th Cir.2003) (\u201c[I]t is well established in this Circuit that when a district court\u2019s decision is correct as a matter of law, a writ of mandamus should be denied.\u201d (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted)). Assuming, without deciding, that we should examine the sufficiency of the evidence under the <em>post-Lopez </em>understanding of the crime, there was evidence from which a reasonable juror could have concluded that Defendants actually aided and abetted the initial transportation of the illegal aliens into the United States. There was evidence that, among other things, 362 Wilson Avenue was a base of operations for an ongoing alien-smuggling operation; that Defendant Rivas-Pozos had transported aliens about 15 times; and that Defendant Ramirez-Esqueda had scouted \u201ccheckpoints\u201d more than 10 times. <em>See Schemenauer, </em>394 F.3d at 751 (\u2018We ... view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and ask <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"608\">*608</page-number>whether it is quite clear that <em>no </em>reasonable juror could have found the elements of each charge beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d). Therefore, the petition for a writ of mandamus must be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-4\">Nos. 07-50386 <em>&amp; </em>07-07-50390: Appeals DISMISSED.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">No. 07-74274: Petition DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b633-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
