Alsup appeals the 180-month mandatory minimum sentence the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> imposed after he pleaded guilty to being a felon in possession of firearms and ammunition, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(g)(1), 924(a)(2). He argues that the district court\u2019s imposition of the mandatory minimum sentence set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1) is illegal, because it is not factually supported. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(1) (\u00a7 922(g) offender who has at least 3 prior convictions for violent felony or serious drug offense is subject to at least 15 years in prison). Specifically, he argues that the court never received into evidence the government\u2019s exhibits concerning his prior felony convictions, and did not make the required findings for the statutory minimum sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-22\">Alsup\u2019s arguments are belied by the record: the sentencing transcript shows clearly that the district court admitted the government\u2019s exhibits supporting and detailing four of his prior felony convictions; and, in its Statement of Reasons, the court specifically adopted, without change, the presentence report, which listed and described the predicate convictions and concluded that armed-career-criminal status was warranted under section 924(e) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b609-24\">Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b609-19\">.
