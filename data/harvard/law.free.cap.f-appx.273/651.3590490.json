Dagaly asserts persecution on account his Chaldean race, Catholic religion, and anti-Baath political opinion. Because the parties are aware of the facts of this case, we do not recount them here. We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. The Immigration Judge (IJ) found that Dagaly lacked credibility. We deny relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-5\">Where, as here, the BIA adopts the decision of the IJ as its own, we review the decision of the IJ. <em>See Tapia v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 997, 999 (9th Cir.2005). The IJ\u2019s factual findings are reviewed for substantial evidence and must be upheld unless the record compels a contrary result. <em>See Monjaraz-Munoz v. INS, </em>327 F.3d 892, 895 (9th Cir.2003); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B). Substantial evidence is \u201cmore than a mere scintilla.\u201d <em>Richardson v. Perales, </em>402 U.S. 389, 401, 91 S.Ct. 1420, 28 L.Ed.2d 842 (1971). \u201cIt means such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201c[T]he IJ must provide specific, cogent reasons for reaching an adverse credibility determination, and minor inconsistencies or factual omissions that do not go to the heart of the asylum claim are insufficient to support it.\u201d <em>Singh v. Ashcroft, </em>367 F.3d 1139, 1143 (9th Cir. 2004) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b678-7\">Here, the IJ determined that Dagaly failed to credibly establish his identity. We hold that the IJ supported his determination with specific, cogent reasons which go to the heart of Dagaly\u2019s asylum claim. <em>Singh, </em>367 F.3d at 1143. The IJ noted that Dagaly used falsified documents to effect his departure from Iraq and his travels to the United States. The IJ also found inconsistencies regarding Dagaly\u2019s place of birth between his birth certificate, his Certificate of Iraqi Citizenship, and his \u201cIndividual\u2019s card.\u201d Further, the IJ found that Dagaly\u2019s Certificate of Iraqi Citizenship contained a different name and birth date than the name he provided in his testimony. Dagaly\u2019s inability to credibly prove his identity goes to the heart of his claim because it prevents him from proving his relation to men that he claims are his father and his uncles and whose alleged assassinations form the basis of his claim of past persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-10\">The IJ also supported the adverse credibility finding with several other reasons. For example, the IJ found that Dagaly\u2019s testimony that his mother and sister continue to live in Iraq without incident was inconsistent with Dagaly\u2019s stated fear of persecution upon return. <em>See Hakeem v. I.N.S., </em>273 F.3d 812, 816 (9th Cir.2001) (\u201cAn applicant\u2019s claim of persecution upon return is weakened, even undercut, when similarly-situated family members continue to live in the country without incident ....\u201d) (internal citation omitted). The IJ further found that the document relied upon to establish the cause of death of Dagaly\u2019s purported father \u2014 according to Dagaly, an assassination that formed the basis of his claim of past persecution \u2014 was questionable. The apparent ease with which Dagaly changed his testimony back and forth when confronted with a discrepancy regarding his arrest date further bolsters the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b678-11\">Accordingly, we hold that substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>determination. We do not reach the IJ\u2019s alternative findings that the harm Dagaly suffered, if credited, did not rise to the level of persecution and that his fear of future persecution was not objectively reasonable in light of changed country conditions in Iraq.</p>\n<p id=\"b679-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b678-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9 th Cir.
