The officers promptly filed a motion to dismiss, arguing that qualified immunity shielded them from suit. The district court held that Rhodes\u2019s allegations, if true, would establish that the officers were entitled to qualified immunity on all but one of Rhodes\u2019s causes of action: his First Amendment retaliatory prosecution claim. The officers have now brought this interlocutory appeal, contending that they are entitled to qualified immunity on Rhodes\u2019s retaliatory prosecution claim as well. For the reasons that follow, we hold that Rhodes\u2019s First Amendment retaliatory prosecution claim is not supported by the pleadings, but his claim for unlawful arrest may be pursued.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-17\">1. We review de novo the district court\u2019s denial of the officers\u2019 motion to dismiss on their defense of qualified immunity.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> To escape the grip of the officers\u2019 qualified immunity defense, Rhodes must establish that on the facts alleged, he has made out his First Amendment retaliatory prosecution claim.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Rhodes cannot do this.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-18\">2. As part of his claim, Rhodes admits he must establish the elements of a malicious prosecution claim.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The officers argue that Rhodes\u2019s allegations do not establish one element of that cause of action \u2014 that a \u201ccriminal action was commenced against him.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The officers contend that Rhodes\u2019s only attempt to meet this element is his conclusory allegation that he was \u201carrested.\u201d The officers argue that being arrested does not mean a criminal action was commenced against you.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-19\">Texas courts have apparently never addressed whether an arrest is sufficient to establish a malicious prosecution claim. But as Rhodes points out, Texas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"330\">*330</page-number>courts typically follow the Restatement in delineating the scope of the tort of malicious prosecution,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and the Restatement counsels that an \u201carrest\u201d can satisfy the criminal-action-commenced-against-you prong of the malicious-prosecution test.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> But a closer look at the Restatement sinks Rhodes\u2019s claim \u2014 simply pleading an \u201carrest\u201d is not enough. Instead, according to the Restatement, the arrest must be <em>lawful; </em>as the Restatement explains:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-4\">Even without the issuance of any process, or indictment or information, criminal proceedings may be instituted by lawful and valid arrest of the accused on a criminal charge. If the arrest is not a valid one, an action for malicious prosecution will not lie unless some further step is taken, such as bringing the accused before a magistrate for determination whether he is to be held.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">If the arrest is not lawful, the defendant can still be held liable, just not under a theory of a First Amendment retaliatory prosecution claim; instead, as the Restatement notes, the plaintiff could have a claim for false imprisonment (i.e., false arrest, a Fourth Amendment claim):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-6\">If there is nothing more than the false arrest and the accused is released without any further proceeding, his remedy is an action for false imprisonment. ... If the arrest is valid and lawful, false imprisonment will not lie.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">But Rhodes has not pleaded that he was lawfully arrested; instead, he pleaded that he was <em>unlawfully </em>arrested. Rhodes\u2019s primary basis for claiming he was arrested can be found in his Rule 7(a) reply; there, he alleges:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b356-9\">Defendant [Officer] Roach intentionally and falsely arrested, fingerprinted, detained, interrogated and prosecuted Rhodes, when he knew such conduct was a violation of Rhodes\u2019s Fourth Amendment right to be free from unlawful search and seizures.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-10\">Elsewhere, Rhodes describes his arrest as \u201cillegal.\u201d Thus, Rhodes has no malicious prosecution claim and the officers should therefore have been granted qualified immunity on Rhodes\u2019s First Amendment retaliatory prosecution claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-11\">This is not to say, however, that Rhodes may not be able to successfully pursue a Fourth Amendment claim. While the district court dismissed his Fourth Amendment claim, Rhodes still has the opportunity to pursue that cause of action. That matter can be taken up by the district court on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-12\">VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b355-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
