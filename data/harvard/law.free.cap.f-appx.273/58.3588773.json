He was acquitted of one count of effecting transactions with one or more unauthorized devices to receive things of value of $1000 or more within a one-year period, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029(a)(5). He was sentenced principally to 87 months\u2019 imprisonment on all counts to be served concurrently. The Government concedes that the sentence for Count One exceeds the statutory maximum of 60 months\u2019 imprisonment and should be corrected. On appeal, defendant argues that the District Court erred in not granting his motion to dismiss the case <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"60\">*60</page-number>pursuant to Federal Rule Criminal Procedure 29 for improper venue, providing the jury flawed instructions on venue, and imposing an allegedly unreasonable sentence. The underlying facts and procedural history are a matter of record and we recount here only those aspects that are pertinent to the disposition of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">The proper forum for a criminal prosecution is the district in which the crime was committed. U.S. Const, art. Ill, \u00a7 2; <em>id. </em>amend VI; Fed.R.Crim.P. 18. The commission of a crime may involve more than one location, and therefore venue may lie in more than one district. <em>United States v. Reed, </em>773 F.2d 477, 480 (2d Cir. 1985). In a \u201ccontinuing offense,\u201d \u201cwhere the acts constituting the crime and the nature of the crime charged implicate more than one location, venue is properly laid in any of the districts where an essential element of the crime took place.\u201d <em>United States v. Ramirez, </em>420 F.3d 134, 139 (2d Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted). For a conspiracy charge, venue is proper \u201cin any district in which the conspiracy was formed or in any district in which a conspirator committed an overt act in furtherance of the criminal scheme.\u201d <em>United States v. Rommy, </em>506 F.3d 108, 119 (2d Cir.2007). Venue is established by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>Id. </em>We view \u201cthe sufficiency of the evidence as to venue in the light most favorable to the [Government, crediting every inference that could have been drawn in its favor.\u201d <em>United States v. Geibel, </em>369 F.3d 682, 696 (2d Cir.2004) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">Defendant, a resident of Staten Island, argues that the Southern District of New York was an improper venue. His argument fails. The Government established, to the satisfaction of the jury, that venue was proper under at least one of three theories: (1) Odunaike or his agent made fraudulent purchases at Mac/s in Manhattan; (2) Odunaike repeatedly traveled over the waters of the Southern District of New York for the purpose of obtaining stolen credit card information from a co-conspirator in Maryland; and (3) Odunaike\u2019s wife and unindicted co-conspirator traveled through the Southern District while committing crimes in Brooklyn, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">Defendant contends that the Court erred in not instructing the jury that venue had to be \u201cin a district where the defendant intentionally or knowingly causes an act in furtherance of the charged offense.\u201d That phrase, taken from <em>United States v. Svoboda, </em>347 F.3d 471, 483 (2d Cir.2003), refers to actions taken by third parties who are not part of the conspiracy, but whose actions furthered the aims of the conspiracy. Here, venue was established by defendant\u2019s actions and those of his co-conspirators, and therefore the appropriate standard is \u2014 as stated by the Court \u2014 whether \u201cit is more likely than not that the crime charged, or any act in furtherance of the crime\u201d occurred in the district.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">The Government concedes that the sentence of 87 months\u2019 imprisonment imposed for Count One exceeds the statutory maximum of 60 months. Accordingly, we modify the judgment to reduce Odunaike\u2019s sentence imposed for Count One to 60 months\u2019 imprisonment, consistent with the statutory maximum set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1029(b)(2). We conclude that the sentence for the remaining counts is reasonable and that the District Court properly considered the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">We have considered all defendant\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"61\">*61</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">For the reasons stated above, the judgment of the District Court is AFFIRMED as modified.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
