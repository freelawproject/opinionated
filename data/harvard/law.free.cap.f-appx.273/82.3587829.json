Lamb, which denied her applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In re Jing, Yun Qing, </em>No. A77 994 016 (B.I.A. July 26, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A77 994 016 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Sept. 30, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-14\">\u2018When the BIA affirms the IJ\u2019s decision in all respects but one, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as modified by the BIA decision, i.e., minus the single argument for denying relief that was rejected by the BIA.\u201d <em>Ming Xia Chen v. BIA, </em>435 F.3d 141, 144 (2d Cir.2006) (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, the BIA declined to adopt the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding, but \u201cagree[dj\u201d with the IJ\u2019s finding that Jing failed to establish eligibility for relief and briefly supplemented the IJ\u2019s reasoning. Accordingly, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as modified and supplemented by the BIA\u2019s decision. <em>See Xue Hong Yang v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>426 F.3d 520, 522 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Yan, Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-15\">We review the agency\u2019s factual findings under the substantial evidence standard and treat them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 <em>&amp; </em>n. 7 (2d Cir.2004), <em>overruled in part on, other-grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dept, of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 305 (2d Cir.2007). However, we will vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Tian-Yong Chen v. INS, </em>359 F.3d 121, 129 (2d Cir.2004). We review de novo questions of law and the application of law to undisputed fact. <em>See, e.g., Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 307 (2d Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b109-16\">As an initial matter, we need not address the agency\u2019s denial of Jing\u2019s with<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>holding of removal and CAT claims because Jing did not challenge the denial of that relief in her brief to this Court. In such circumstances, we deem the claims abandoned. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 546 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005). Likewise, because Jing failed to raise any asylum claim based on past persecution in her brief, we deem any such claim waived. <em>Id. </em>Additionally, we decline to consider Jing\u2019s argument that she fears being forcibly subjected to gynecological examinations and IUD insertion because the Government correctly asserts that she failed to exhaust her administrative remedies with respect to those issues. <em>See Lin Zhong v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>480 F.3d 104, 124 (2d Cir.2007) (describing issue exhaustion as an \u201caffirmative defense subject to waiver\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">As to Jing\u2019s claimed fear of future persecution based on her desire to have additional children, the record supports the agency\u2019s denial of her claim where she had only a single U.S.-born child, was not pregnant, and did not allege that she was presently attempting to conceive. <em>See Jian Xing Huang v. INS, </em>421 F.3d 125, 129 (2d Cir.2005) (per curiam) (finding that, \u201c[i]n the absence of solid support in the record\u201d for petitioner\u2019s assertion that he will be subjected to persecution on account of his two U.S.-born children, \u201chis fear is speculative at best\u201d); <em>see also INS v. CardozaFonseca, </em>480 U.S. 421, 440, 107 S.Ct. 1207, 94 L.Ed.2d 434 (1987) (emphasizing that a well-founded fear does not require high probability of persecution, but does require \u201can objective situation ... established by the evidence\u201d). To the extent Jing asserted a desire to have a second child at some point in the indefinite future, that evidence is insufficient, by itself, to demonstrate a well-grounded objective fear of future persecution. <em>See, e.g., Jian Wen Wang v. BCIS, </em>437 F.3d 276, 278 (2d Cir.2006); <em>cf. Rui Ying Lin v. Gonzales, </em>445 F.3d 127,135-36 (2d Cir.2006) (holding that substantial evidence did not support agency\u2019s finding fear \u201cspeculative\u201d when petitioner had \u201coffered evidence that she had already had two children, that she planned to have more, that she had gone to great lengths to avoid being sterilized in China, and that she had removed her IUD after escaping to the United States\u201d). Insofar as Jing claimed a fear of forced sterilization, the agency properly found that Jing failed to demonstrate that her fear was objectively reasonable where background materials did not support it. <em>See Matter of J-W-S-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 185, 190 (BIA 2007) (despite recognizing isolated reports of forced sterilization in the record, finding that such occasional incidents do not indicate that the applicant would be singled out for this treatment upon her return to China). Accordingly, the agency\u2019s denial of Jing\u2019s application for asylum was not in error.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, Jing\u2019s pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b109-12\">. Throughout the record, Petitioner's name is spelled alternately as Jing and Jiang. We refer to Petitioner as Jing in this order because that is the spelling used by the BIA in its decision.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
