Sand, of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b42-15\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b42-16\">Defendant-Appellant Bruce Corrigan appeals from the June 28, 2007 judgment of the District Court for the District of Connecticut (Arterton, J.) sentencing him to 8 months\u2019 imprisonment after he pleaded guilty to mail fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and proceedings below.</p>\n<p id=\"b42-17\">Corrigan\u2019s first argument on appeal is that the district court abused its discretion and committed clear error when it determined the intended loss to be $18,500. \u201cWe review the factual determinations underlying a district court\u2019s loss calculation at sentencing for clear error and its application of the Sentencing Guidelines de novo.\u201d <em>United States v. Canova, </em>412 F.3d 331, 351 (2d Cir.2005). Under the Guidelines, \u201closs\u201d is defined as \u201cthe greater of actual loss or intended loss.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1 cmt. 3(A). The \u201cintended loss\u201d is \u201cthe pecuniary harm that was intended to result from the offense\u201d and it \u201cincludes intended pecuniary harm that would have been impossible or unlikely to occur <em>(e.g., </em>as in a government sting operation ...).\u201d <em>Id. </em>cmt. 3(A)(ii). We have described \u201cintended loss\u201d as \u201cthe probable loss from a particular misstatement because one is presumed to intend the natural and \u2018probable\u2019 consequences of one\u2019s acts.\u201d <em>United States v. Carboni, </em>204 F.3d 39, 47 (2d Cir.2000) (internal quotation marks omitted). The district court \u201cneed only make a reasonable estimate of the loss.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1 cmt. 3(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>The district court\u2019s finding that the \u201cprobable loss\u201d from Corrigan\u2019s fraudulent statement was $18,500 was not clearly erroneous. Corrigan had been recorded telling Agent that the lost wages statement brought his case \u201cup a notch\u201d and \u201cput [him] in a different category.\u201d As the district court observed, the lost wages amount was not simply one of several separate, divisible amounts that made up the larger claim; the lost wages were \u201calso a consideration of how injured a person was, such that they couldn\u2019t work for X period of time,\u201d thereby \u201creally transformfing]\u201d the insurance claim by \u201cdriving valuation of the noneconomic damages.\u201d The district court thus found that the lost wages statement was part of a larger, integrated claim, and that Corrigan intended the lost wages statement to affect the amount of the claim by more than the lost wages amount itself. These findings are not clearly erroneous, as Corrigan himself told the Agent that the lost wages statement \u201cput [him] in a different category.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b43-5\">Corrigan\u2019s second claim is that the district court violated Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32 and due process when it \u201cdid not disclose\u201d the Fogel report. Under Rule 32, the district court \u201cmust allow the parties\u2019 attorneys to comment on the probation officer\u2019s determinations and other matters relating to an appropriate sentence.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(i)(l)(C). Defendant\u2019s claim of error is weak: The district court itself offered to have the Government give Corrigan\u2019s attorney a copy of the Fogel report. In any event, Corrigan affirmatively waived this claim when he declined the district court\u2019s offer to provide him with a copy of the report. Corrigan\u2019s decision to decline the district court\u2019s offer makes clear that if there was any error, it was one that Corrigan \u201chimself invited\u201d and as to which he is therefore \u201cnot entitled to relief.\u201d <em>United States v. Wellington, </em>417 F.3d 284, 290 (2d Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-7\">Corrigan\u2019s final argument is that the district court erred by taking into consideration the allocution by a separate defendant in another case, Mr. Francois. As an initial matter, Corrigan\u2019s belief that the district court relied on the Francois allocution when sentencing Corrigan is somewhat speculative, as the court described the allocution as \u201cnot part of the relevant conduct\u201d and later confirmed that it had \u201csentenced [Corrigan] for just the offense of conviction.\u201d Even if the district court did rely on the allocution as Corrigan claims, that reliance was not error. <em>See United States v. Carmona, </em>873 F.2d 569, 574 (2d Cir.1989) (\u201cThe fact that some material, upon which the trial judge relied, may have had its source in a judicial proceeding in which appellant was not a defendant or represented by counsel does not bar its use.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b43-8\">As for Corrigan\u2019s claim that the district court\u2019s failure to notify Defendant of its intention to consider the Francois allocution violated Rule 32 and due process, our review is for plain error because he made no objection on this basis before the district court. Fed.R.CrimJP. 52(b). We need not address whether the district court committed error or whether that error was plain, because Corrigan has not shown that the alleged error affected his substantial rights. The purpose of any notice the district court should have given would have been to effectuate Corrigan\u2019s ability to respond to the material at issue. Corrigan has not identified how the lack of notice impaired his ability to \u201ccomment\u201d on Francois\u2019s allocution, claiming neither that the material therein was false nor that he had evidence undermining its credibility-</p>\n<p id=\"b44-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>We have considered all of Corrigan\u2019s other arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
