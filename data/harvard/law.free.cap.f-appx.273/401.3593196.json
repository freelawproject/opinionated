Reed was sentenced to 51 months of imprisonment and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"402\">*402</page-number>three years of supervised release. Reed argues that the district court erred in imposing an enhancement pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6), which provides for a four-level increase if firearms are possessed in connection with another felony offense, in this case, drug possession. Reed asserts that there was an insufficient nexus between the firearm and the drug offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-4\">Under the law of this circuit set forth in <em>United States v. Armstead, </em>114 F.3d 504, 511 (5th Cir.1997), and <em>United States v. Condren, </em>18 F.3d 1190, 1194 (5th Cir.1994), the \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) enhancement was appropriate. Reed\u2019s firearm was located in close proximity to both Reed himself and the drugs. Additionally, because the firearm was underneath Reed\u2019s seat, it was \u201creadily available to [Reed] to protect his drug-related activities\u201d and had the potential of facilitating his drug-related activities. <em>Condren, </em>18 F.3d at 1200; \u00a7 2K2.1, comment. (n.14(A)). Therefore, the imposition of the enhancement was not erroneous. <em>See Armstead, </em>114 F.3d at 511-12; <em>Condren, </em>18 F.3d at 1199-1200.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-5\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b427-24\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
