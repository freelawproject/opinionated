On August 7, 2007, the District Court granted defendants\u2019 motion to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1) for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The Court reasoned that, \u201c[ujnder the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine, this Court is prohibited from taking juris<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>diction over a claim appealing a state court decision.\u201d Rapisardi now appeals from the District Court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint seeking \u201cfederal review of the facts of this case.\u201d <em>(See </em>Compl. at 1.)</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">We have jurisdiction over this appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and exercise pie-nary review of the District Court\u2019s application of the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine. <em>See Turner v. Crawford Square Apartments III, L.P., </em>449 F.3d 542, 547 (3d Cir.2006). We also exercise plenary review over the dismissal of a complaint under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1). <em>See In re Cybergenics Corp., </em>226 F.3d 237, 239 (3d Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">In some circumstances, the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine deprives a federal district court of jurisdiction to review a state court adjudication. <em>Turner, </em>449 F.3d at 547. The <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine applies to \u201ccases brought by state-court losers complaining of injuries caused by state-court judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.\u201d <em>Exxon, Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., </em>544 U.S. 280, 284, 125 S.Ct. 1517, 161 L.Ed.2d 454 (2005). Here, Rapisardi seeks to dismiss all judgments against him issued by the Superior Court of New Jersey, Appellate Division, and to vacate all fines, penalties, sanctions and restoration orders imposed, He also seeks to expunge both his own credit record and that of the estate of Rosario Rapisardi. Rapisardi disputes the District Courts conclusion that his claims are barred by the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-6\">The allegations concerning the fines, penalties, sanctions and restoration orders issued by the Superior Court of New Jersey, Appellate Division, as well as the re-suiting damage to the Rapisardis\u2019 credit reports, clearly constitute complaints about putative injuries caused by a state court judgment. Thus, the District Court properly concluded that it lacked jurisdiction over these claims. <em>See Holt v. Lake County Bd. of Comm\u2019rs, </em>408 F.3d 335, 336 (7th Cir.2005) (plaintiffs action barred by <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>because \u201c[plaintiffs] injury was caused by the state court judgnients ... [and] absent the state court\u2019s judgment ... [plaintiff] would not have the injury he now seeks to redress\u201d) (per curiam) (cited in <em>Turner, </em>449 F.3d at 547).</p>\n<p id=\"AL\">Rapisardi argues that New Jersey did not have the legal authority or jurisdiction to prosecute the charges against him, pursuant to <em>Rapanos v. United States, </em>547 U.S. 715, 126 S.Ct. 2208, 165 L.Ed.2d 159 (2006) and, therefore, that federal subject matter jurisdiction is proper.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Rapanos </em>is inapposite. In <em>Rapanos, </em>the Supreme Court attempted to clarify what qualifies as a regulable water under the <em>federal </em>Clean Water Act for purposes of the exerrise of federal jurisdiction over certain waterways. The opinion does not, however, provide any basis for subject matter jurisdiction over Rapisardi\u2019s claims, which seek to overturn various state court judgments against James and Rosario Rapisardi for the violation of <em>state </em>environmental laws.</p>\n<p id=\"AXB\">Moreover, to the extent that review of any 0f Rapisardi\u2019s claims is not barred by the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine, they are barred by res judicata because he is attempting to relitigate issues previously determined by the New Jersey Superior Court. Under New Jersey law, res judicata requires the following elements: (1) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>final judgment in the prior action must be valid, final, and on the merits; (2) the parties in the later action must be identical to or in privity with those in the prior action; and (3) the claim in the later action must grow out of the same transaction or occurrence as the claim in the earlier one. <em>See McNeil v. Legislative Apportionment Comm\u2019n of the State of N.J., </em>177 N.J. 364, 828 A.2d 840, 859 (2003). There is no , , question that all three elements are present here; therefore, res judicata precludes federal court review of any of the claims presented in this case.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b208-17\">. We need not repeat the details of the underlying dispute as they are well-known to the parties and are summarized in the District Court\u2019s memorandum.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b209-7\">. Plaintiff refers to the case in his papers as <em>Carabell v. U.S. Amiy Corps of Engineers; </em>however, the matter appeared before the Supreme Court as a consolidated case and is captioned as <em>Rapanos v. United States, </em>547 U.S. 715, 126 S.Ct. 2208, 165 L.Ed.2d 159 (2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"Amj\">. In his reply brief, Rapisardi argues that federal jurisdiction is proper based on alleged constitutional violations resulting from the state court judgments against him. However, we need not address these allegations for the first time on appeal, as Rapisardi did not raise these claims in his complaint before the District Court. <em>See Ross v. Hotel Employees and Rest. Employees Int\u2019l Union, </em>266 F.3d 236, 242 (3d Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
