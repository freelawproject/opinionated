Fleming contends that it was plain error for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>District Court to find, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he had committed these crimes because the Fifth and Sixth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution require that a jury make such findings beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">We have previously considered and rejected Fleming\u2019s contention. <em>See United States v. Carlton, </em>442 F.3d 802, 809 (2d Cir.2006) (\u201cGiven a prior conviction and the proper imposition of conditions on the term of supervised release, when a defendant fails to abide by those conditions the government is not then put to the burden of an adversarial criminal trial. Instead, there is, as in this case, a revocation of release hearing at which, as the Supreme Court instructs, neither the right to a jury trial, nor proof beyond a reasonable doubt is required.\u201d); <em>United States v. McNeil, </em>415 F.3d 273, 277 (2d Cir.2005) (\u201c[A] violation of supervised release is not a separate basis for criminal punishment that requires a jury verdict and all that entails.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Recognizing that these precedents remain in force within our circuit, Fleming urges us to reverse our prior holdings, but he fails to offer a persuasive reason \u2014 and we are aware of none \u2014 to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
