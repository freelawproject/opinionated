We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-6\">We review a grant of summary judgment <em>de novo, </em>\u201cconstruing the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Vietnam Ass\u2019n for Victims of Agent Orange v. Dow Chem. Co., </em>517 F.3d 104, 115 (2d Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 imposes liability on any person who under color of state law \u201csubjects ... any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws\u201d of the United States. We analyze the appellant\u2019s claim that Police Officer Ronald Donnatin (\u201cDonnatin\u201d) violated Anthony Costello\u2019s (\u201cCostello\u201d) Fourth Amendment right to freedom from the use of excessive force according to the Fourth Amendment\u2019s reasonableness standard. <em>Salim v. Proulx, </em>93 F.3d 86, 88-89 (2d Cir.1996). To survive summary judgment, the appellant was required to raise a material question of fact as to whether Donnatin\u2019s decision to use deadly force was \u201cobjectively reasonable,\u201d or in other words, whether he had \u201cprobable cause to believe that [Costello] pose[d] a significant threat of death or serious physical injury to [himself] or others.\u201d <em>Cowan ex rel. Estate of Cooper v. Breen, </em>352 F.3d 756, 762 (2d Cir.2003) (internal quotation marks omitted). Contrary to the appellant\u2019s assertions, whether Donnatin\u2019s decision was objectively reasonable \u201cdepends only upon [his] knowledge of circumstances immediately prior to and at the moment that he made the split-second decision to employ deadly force.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">Minutes before Donnatin\u2019s decision to shoot, Costello sat in the driver\u2019s seat of his car, which was boxed in between the cars of a police officer and a detective. Although six police officers were standing next to or close to the car, Costello put the vehicle into drive and stepped on the gas. The car then moved forward and backwards, and hit the car in front of it. It appeared to Donnatin, who was standing near the passenger side door of Costello\u2019s car, that Costello was then \u201cgoing to back the car up\u201d again. At this moment, it was objectively reasonable for Donnatin to believe that at least one police officer was underneath Costello\u2019s car, that other officers may have been hurt, and that Costello would continue to use his car to inflict serious bodily harm on the other arresting officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">The appellant\u2019s arguments to the contrary are without merit. Whether the police officers whom Costello knocked over with his car were actually \u201cout of any danger\u201d is not dispositive. We evaluate the reasonableness of Donnatin\u2019s decision based on his own knowledge of the circumstances immediately prior to his split-second decision to shoot and conclude that under the circumstances presented, Donnatin\u2019s conduct was reasonable. <em>See Graham v. Connor, </em>490 U.S. 386, 396, 109 S.Ct. 1865, 104 L.Ed.2d 443 (1989) (\u201cThe \u2018reasonableness\u2019 of a particular use of force must be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene, rather than with the 20/20 vision of hindsight.\u201d). Moreover, contrary to appellant\u2019s assertions, Donnatin was not required to have acted in self-defense or to have confronted a fleeing felon in order for his decision to use deadly force to be objectively reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">Furthermore, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>Town of Warwick on the municipal liability claim. <em>See Monell v. Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs., </em>436 U.S. 658, 694-95, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978) (holding that a local government may not be sued under \u00a7 1983 on the theory of <em>respondeat superior). </em>Nor did it abuse its discretion when it declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the appellant\u2019s remaining state law claims after the dismissal of all federal claims. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1367(c)(3); <em>Adams v. Suozzi, </em>517 F.3d 124, 129 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">We have considered the appellant\u2019s remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, the judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
