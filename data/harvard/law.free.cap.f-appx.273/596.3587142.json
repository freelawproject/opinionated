To the extent that it exists, we have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We must accord <em>Chevron </em>deference to the BIA\u2019s statutory interpretations of the Immigration and Naturalization Act (\u201cINA\u201d). <em>INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre, </em>526 U.S. 415, 424, 119 S.Ct. 1439, 143 L.Ed.2d 590 (1999) (citing <em>Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em>467 U.S. 837, 842, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984)).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-16\">Under INA section 240A(b)(1) the Attorney General may cancel removal of an alien deportable from the United States if the alien: \u201c(A) has been physically present in the United States for a continuous period of not less than 10 years immediately preceding the date of such application; (B) has been a person of good moral character during such period; (C) has not been convicted of an offense under [section 212(a)(2), 237(a)(2), or 237(a)(3)] ...; and (D) establishes that removal would result in exceptional and extremely unusual hardship to the alien\u2019s spouse, parent, or child, who is a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b623-17\">Because the BIA summarily affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision in petitioners\u2019 original proceedings, we review the IJ\u2019s decision as the final agency action. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number><em>Falcon Carriche v. Ashcroft, </em>350 F.3d 845, 848-49 (9th Cir.2003). We have no jurisdiction to decide Cervantes\u2019s appeal of the IJ\u2019s original hardship determination. Under the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (\u201cIIRIRA\u201d), we lack jurisdiction to review any discretionary judgment regarding certain components of the granting of relief for cancellation of removal. <em>See 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B). \u201c[A]n \u2018exceptional and extremely unusual hardship\u2019 determination is a subjective, discretionary judgment that has been carved out of our appellate jurisdiction.\u201d <em>Romero-Torres v. Ashcroft, </em>327 F.3d 887, 888 (9th Cir.2003). Accordingly, we may not review the IJ\u2019s original hardship determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">We also may not review petitioners\u2019 first ineffective assistance of counsel claim. \u201cFailure to raise an issue in an appeal to the BIA constitutes a failure to exhaust remedies with respect to that question and deprives this court of jurisdiction to hear the matter.\u201d <em>Vargas v. INS, </em>831 F.2d 906, 907-908 (9th Cir.1987). Petitioners did not raise their claim before the BIA, nor did they comply with the requirements for raising such a claim. <em>See Matter of Lozada, </em>19 I &amp; N Dec. 637 (BIA 1988) (setting forth procedural requirements for ineffective assistance claims). Because they failed to raise their first ineffective assistance of counsel claim to the BIA, petitioners are foreclosed from arguing it here. This court does not have jurisdiction to resolve petitioners\u2019 first ineffective assistance claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-6\">However, we retain jurisdiction to review nondiscretionary cancellation of removal decisions such as those concerning whether one has a qualifying relative, <em>Falcon Carriche, </em>350 F.3d at 853, so we may consider whether the IJ appropriately denied Alma\u2019s application for cancellation of removal based on the qualifying relative prong. To have a qualifying relative, an applicant must have a \u201cspouse, parent, or child, who is a citizen of the United States or an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229b(b)(l)(D). The IJ correctly determined that Alma had no qualifying relative, given that she had no spouse or children, and neither of her parents are United States citizens or aliens lawfully admitted for permanent residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b624-11\">We also may consider the BIA\u2019s denial of petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Where \u201can independent claim such as ineffective assistance of counsel is at issue, we have jurisdiction to determine whether a petitioner was prejudiced, an assessment that can depend in cancellation of removal cases on hardship evaluations.\u201d <em>Fernandez v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 592, 602 (9th Cir.2006). Because petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen presents an independent ineffective assistance of counsel claim based on their previous counsel\u2019s failure to file a timely motion to reopen, we have jurisdiction to determine whether petitioners were prejudiced by that failure. We review for an abuse of discretion, <em>see Cano-Merida v. INS, </em>311 F.3d 960, 964 (9th Cir.2002), and must uphold the BIA\u2019s denial of petitioners\u2019 motion to reopen \u201cunless it is arbitrary, irrational, or contrary to law.\u201d <em>Ahwazi v. INS, </em>751 F.2d 1120, 1122 (9th Cir.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b624-12\">The BIA did not abuse its discretion in determining that petitioners failed to demonstrate prejudice from their prior coun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>sel\u2019s ineffective assistance.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> To succeed on their ineffective assistance of counsel claim, petitioners must show \u201cthat the alleged violation\u201d \u2014 here, their previous counsel\u2019s failure to file a timely motion to reopen \u2014 \u201caffected the outcome of the proceedings,\u201d <em>Lata v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 1241, 1246 (9th Cir.2000); <em>ie., </em>they must demonstrate that a timely filing would have been successful.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-5\">When timely filing a motion for reopening, a movant \u201cmust support the motion with new evidence,\u201d and must \u201cestablish a prima facie case for relief....\u201d <em>Ordonez v. INS, </em>345 F.3d 777, 785 (9th Cir.2003). Reopening of proceedings is appropriate \u201cwhere the new facts alleged, when coupled with the facts already of record, satisfy us that it would be worthwhile to develop the issues further at a plenary hearing on reopening.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cThe BIA abuses its discretion [in denying a motion to reopen] when it fails to offer a reasoned explanation for its decision, distorts or disregards important aspects of the alien\u2019s claim.\u201d <em>Konstantinova v. INS, </em>195 F.3d 528, 529 (9th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b625-6\">Here, the BIA gave a reasoned explanation for its decision and adequately considered petitioners\u2019 claim. Although it did not specifically address each proffered piece of evidence in support of petitioners\u2019 hardship claim, the BIA\u2019s decision reflected a consideration of the evidence and did not contest the seriousness of the son\u2019s skin condition. To succeed in their motion, petitioners needed to demonstrate a prima facie ease that removal would result in extremely unusual hardship to their son. However, petitioners presented no evidence that treatment for vitiligo was unavailable in Mexico, and thus no evidence that removal would cause the requisite hardship to the son.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-9\">Moreover, it is irrelevant that the BIA failed to consider the unavailability of vitiligo treatment in Mexico to petitioners specifically in light of their particular economic circumstances. \u201cBecause [a] movant must only make a prima facie showing, the BIA is required to accept the facts stated in the alien\u2019s affidavit unless they are inherently unbelievable.\u201d <em>Ordonez, </em>345 F.3d at 786. However, petitioners never articulated this argument in their motion to reopen, so the argument was not a part of the evidence before the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-10\">Because petitioners did not show that, absent their attorney\u2019s error, they would have been able to establish a prima facie case that the son would suffer extremely unusual hardship warranting further consideration of their application, we conclude that there was no abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-11\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b623-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b623-14\">. Lead petitioner Fidel Serrano Gutierrez\u2019s petition for review of the BIA decision is the subject of a separate, published opinion filed contemporaneously with this disposition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b623-18\"><em>. </em>Because the parties are familiar with the facts and procedural history, we do not restate them here except as necessary to explain our disposition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"Ahn\">. Cervantes is the only one of the petitioners who might benefit from the motion to reopen on the hardship determination, given that the applications of Alma, as discussed herein, and Serrano, as discussed in the separate, published opinion, fail on independent bases.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b625-7\">. The BIA properly determined that equitable tolling excused petitioners\u2019 untimely filing of their motion to reopen, in light of their prior counsel\u2019s statements that petitioners\u2019 only option was to appeal to our circuit. <em>See SocopGonzalez v. INS, </em>272 F.3d 1176, 1184-1185 (9th Cir.2001) (holding that one need only show that reasonable diligence would not have led to the discovery of essential information bearing on the claim).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
