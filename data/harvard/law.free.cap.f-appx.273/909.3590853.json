Principi, </em>01-968, 2004 WL 1637969 (July 8, 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-24\">The Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals determined that no new and material evidence had been submitted to reopen Larry D. Williams\u2019 claim for service connection for narcolepsy. The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims vacated the Board\u2019s decision with respect to the narcolepsy claim and remanded.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b935-25\">This case was stayed pending the court\u2019s disposition in <em>Roan v. Principi, </em>2004-7093, which was stayed pending the court\u2019s disposition in <em>Sanders v. Nicholson, </em>487 F.3d 881 (Fed.Cir.2007), and its companion case <em>Simmons v. Nicholson, </em>487 F.3d 892 (Fed. Cir.2007). In <em>Sanders, </em>this court held that any 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5103(a) error should be presumed prejudicial and the Secretary has the burden of rebutting this presumption. <em>Id. </em>at 891.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-26\">The court agrees that summary affirmance of the judgment vacating in part and remanding to the Board is appropriate in light of our decisions in <em>Simmons </em>and <em>Sanders.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b935-27\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b935-28\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b936-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>(1) The stay of proceedings is lifted.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">(2) The judgment of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims is summarily affirmed. The case is remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-5\">(3) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-6\">(4) All pending motions are moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b935-19\"> The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims determined that Williams' claim for entitlement to a total disability rating based on individual unemployability was abandoned.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
