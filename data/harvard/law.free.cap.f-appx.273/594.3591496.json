Jones, District Judge for the District of Nevada, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b621-9\">ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b621-10\">The memorandum disposition filed on May 26, 2006 is withdrawn. A superseding opinion and superseding memorandum disposition will be filed concurrently with this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-11\">The petition for rehearing and for rehearing en banc is DENIED as moot. The parties may file new petitions for rehearing or rehearing en banc as provided by Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 40.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-14\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-15\">Malik Smith appeals his conviction for assaulting a fellow inmate with a dangerous weapon in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 113(a)(3). He also appeals the 100-month sentence imposed consecutively to his undischarged term of imprisonment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b621-16\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. The facts are known to the parties and will not be repeated here.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-17\">The government concedes, as it must, that the district court\u2019s imposition of a non-treatment drug testing supervised released condition that failed to state the maximum number of drug tests constituted an impermissible delegation of the court\u2019s statutory duty under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(d). <em>See United States v. Stephens, </em>424 F.3d 876, 883-84 (9th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-18\">The government also conceded, at oral argument, that the district court erroneously consulted U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(a) instead of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(c) when it denied Smith\u2019s request for a concurrent sentence. We conclude that this error was not harmless. Because the district court failed to consult \u00a7 5G1.3(c), we cannot confidently conclude that the district court considered the appropriate factors when deciding whether to impose a wholly concurrent, partially concurrent, or consecutive sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-19\">Because we conclude that the district court\u2019s error in applying the wrong guideline was not harmless, we do not reach Smith\u2019s claim that his sentence is unreasonable. <em>See United States v. Cantrell, </em>433 F.3d 1269,1280 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b622-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"596\">*596</page-number>Accordingly, we REVERSE and REMAND for re-sentencing as to the non-treatment drug testing supervised release condition and as to the determination to impose Smith\u2019s sentence concurrently, partially concurrently, or consecutively to his undischarged term of imprisonment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b621-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b621-20\">. We consider only Smith's sentencing claims in this memorandum disposition. In a concurrently filed opinion, we addressed Smith\u2019s separate challenges to his conviction. <em>See United States v. Smith, </em>520 F.3d 1097 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
