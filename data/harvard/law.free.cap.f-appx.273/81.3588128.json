Nelson, denying his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). <em>In Jian Xin Chen, </em>No. A98 718 147 (B.I.A. Aug. 20, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A98 718 147 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Oct. 20, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity \u25a0with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-23\">When the BIA issues an opinion that fully adopts the IJ\u2019s decision, we review the IJ\u2019s decision. <em>See Chun Gao v. Gonzales, </em>424 F.3d 122, 124 (2d Cir.2005); <em>Secaida-Rosales v. INS, </em>331 F.3d 297, 305 (2d Cir.2003). We review the agency\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard, treating them as \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B); <em>see, e.g., Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 &amp; n. 7 (2d Cir.2004), <em>overruled in part on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number><em>Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296 (2d Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">We find that substantial evidence in the record supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. Chen\u2019s failure to mention his involvement in Falun Gong when interviewed by a border patrol agent was a significant omission. <em>See Latifi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 103,105 (2d Cir.2005). Because Chen\u2019s application for relief was based upon his allegation that he had been persecuted on account of his Falun Gong activities, this omission went to the very heart of his claim. <em>See Cheng Tong Wang v. Gonzales, </em>449 F.3d 451, 454 (2d Cir. 2006); <em>Secaida-Rosales, </em>331 F.3d at 308.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-5\">Where discrepancies arise from an applicant\u2019s statements in an airport or other administrative interview taken upon the applicant\u2019s arrival in the United States, we generally evaluate the interview using the factors set forth in <em>Ramsameachire v. Ashcroft, </em>357 F.3d 169, 179 (2d Cir.2004). In this case, however, Chen acknowledged that he failed to inform the agent of his involvement in Falun Gong. Moreover, the IJ was not obligated to credit Chen\u2019s explanation that the snakehead who smuggled him out of China warned him that he would be sent back to China if he told the border authorities he was involved in Falun Gong. <em>See Majidi v. Gonzales, </em>430 F.3d 77, 80-81 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-6\">In addition, when considered cumulatively with the omission cited above, the inconsistency between Chen\u2019s testimony regarding his beating and the statements contained in his father\u2019s letter, although relatively minor, provided further support for the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii); <em>Tu Lin v. Gonzales, </em>446 F.3d 395, 400 (2d Cir.2006) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b108-7\">The IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination necessarily precludes the success of Chen\u2019s claims for asylum and withholding of removal. <em>See Paul v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 148, 156 (2d Cir.2006). Furthermore, because the only evidence that it was more likely than not that Chen would be tortured if he returned to China depended upon his credibility, his CAT claim also necessarily fails. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b108-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
