Principi, </em>02-0626, 2003 WL 23008790 (Dec. 10, 2003) and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-32\">Harris N. Holl\u00edn appealed to the CAVC, challenging an April 17, 2002 decision of the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals that, inter alia, denied an effective date prior to October 27, 1998, for an award of service connection for bilateral hearing loss and denied his motion to revise an October 27, 1998 regional office (RO) decision awarding Holl\u00edn entitlement to service connec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>tion for hearing loss because of clear and unmistakable error (CUE). Holl\u00edn argued, inter alia, that (1) the Secretary had failed to provide him 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 5103(a) notice regarding his earlier effective date claim and (2) the Board erred in determining there was no CUE in the October 1998 RO decision because it failed to consider whether he had a pending unadjudicated claim resulting from an alleged filing of an informal claim in 1953.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">The CAVC affirmed the Board\u2019s determination that no CUE existed in the October 1998 RO decision. Regarding Hollin\u2019s earlier effective date claim, the CAVC determined that the Secretary was obligated to provide section 5103(a) notice and had failed to satisfy his obligations. Therefore, the CAVC vacated that portion of the Board\u2019s decision and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-5\">Holl\u00edn and the Secretary appealed. The case was stayed at the parties\u2019 request pending our disposition in <em>Sanders v. Nicholson, </em>487 F.3d 881 (Fed.Cir.2007) and its companion case <em>Simmons v. Nicholson, </em>487 F.3d 892 (Fed.Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b952-6\">The parties assert that recent cases have likely disposed of the issues raised by this case. For example, they note that our recent in <em>Hartman v. Nicholson, </em>483 F.3d 1311, 1314-15 (Fed.Cir.2007), held that section 5103(a) does not apply to proceedings that take place after an RO\u2019s initial decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-7\">The parties also note that the CAVC issued a decision in <em>Criswell v. Nicholson, </em>20 Vet.App. 501 (2006) that might affect the issues in this case. The parties\u2019 joint motion contends that it is in the interest of justice to vacate the CAVC\u2019s judgment as to Hollin\u2019s earlier effective date claim for his service connected bilateral hearing loss and his motion to revise the RO\u2019s October 27, 1998 decision for the CAVC to consider <em>Hartman, Sanders, </em>and any other recent relevant cases in the first instance. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-9\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b952-10\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b952-11\">(1) The motion is granted. The CAVC\u2019s judgment is vacated-in-part as noted above and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this order.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-12\">(2) Each side shall bear its own cost.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
