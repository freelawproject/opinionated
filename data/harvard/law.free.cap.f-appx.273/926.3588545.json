Sal-man (Salman) petition for permission to appeal orders certified by the United States Court of Federal Claims as ones involving controlling issues of law as to which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion and for which an immediate appeal may materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation. The United States consents to Salman\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-8\">Salman filed a complaint at the Court of Federal Claims for readjustment of partnership items pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6226. Salman sought reversal or invalidation of a Notice of Final Partnership Administrative Adjustment (FPAA) issued by the Internal Revenue Service regarding Salman\u2019s 1999 federal tax returns. The FPAA alleged that in 1999 Salman had sold a ranch and overstated the appropriate basis in the ranch, resulting in an understatement in reported gains associated from the ranch\u2019s sale. Salman moved for summary judgment, asserting that the statute of limitations provisions in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6501(a) and 6229 barred the IRS from assessing a tax adjustment because the FPAA was not issued within three years from the date of filing of Salman\u2019s 1999 tax returns. The government opposed and filed a cross-motion for partial summary judgment, asserting that, pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6501(e)(1)(A), the statutory window for assessing a tax adjustment against Salman was extended to six years because Salman had omitted an amount in excess of 25 percent of gross income in their 1999 return.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-16\">On November 9, 2007, 2007 WL 3378145, the Court of Federal Claims denied Sal-man\u2019s motion. The court held that Sal-man\u2019s overstatement in them 1999 tax return was an omission within the meaning of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6501(e) and 6229(c)(2), thus extending the period for assessing an adjustment to six years. The court further held that Salman\u2019s sale of the ranch did not qualify for the trade or business definition of gross income in 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6501(e)(1)(A)(i) and that Salman did not qualify for the adequate disclosure safe harbor of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6501(e)(1)(A)(ii). Because the FPAA was assessed within six years from the 1999 tax return, the court granted the government\u2019s cross-motion for partial summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-10\">On December 6, 2007, 2007 WL 4707751, the Court of Federal Claims granted Sal-man\u2019s unopposed motion to amend the November 9, 2007 order and to add a statement certifying the order for interlocutory appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-11\">Ultimately, this court must exercise its own discretion in deciding whether it will grant permission to appeal interlocutory orders certified by a trial court. <em>See In re Convertible Rowing Exerciser Patent Litigation, </em>90S F.2d 822 (Fed.Cir.1990); 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(d)(2) (\u201cthe Federal Circuit may, in its discretion, permit an appeal to be taken from such order\u201d). We determine that granting the petition in these circumstances is warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b953-12\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b953-13\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b953-14\">The petition for permission to appeal is granted.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
