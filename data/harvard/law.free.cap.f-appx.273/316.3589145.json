September 26, 2007, leaving pending m the district court Appellees\u2019 motions for at least $425,000 attorney\u2019s fees pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(d)(2). A review of the record on appeal demonstrates that Appellants\u2019 untimely performance in this court mirrors a lengthy history in the district court of dilatoriness and hollow posturing interspersed with periods of non-performanee or insubstantial performance and compliance by Appellants and their counsel, leaving the unmistakable impression that they have no purpose other than to prolong this contumacious litigation for purposes of harassment or delay, or both. The time is long overdue to termmate Appellants\u2019 feckless litigation at the obvious cost of time and money to the Defendants by affirming all rulings of the distnct court but remanding the case to that court for the reinstatement of its consideration of Appellees\u2019 motion for attorney\u2019s fees. In so doing, we caution Appellants that any further efforts to prolong or continue proceedings in this court, including the filing of petitions for rehearing, will potentially expose them to the fall panoply of penalties, sanctions, damages, and double costs pursuant to FRAP 38 at our disposal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"ARz\">AFFIRMED; REMANDED FOR RULING AND DETERMINATION OF APPELLEES\u2019 MOTION FOR ATTORNEY\u2019S FEES.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"Ayp\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
