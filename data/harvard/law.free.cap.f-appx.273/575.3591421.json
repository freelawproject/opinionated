Upon review, we conclude that dismissal was proper for the reasons stated by the court, and there is no basis for reversal. Accordingly, we affirm. <em>See </em>8th Cir. R. 47B. Koenig\u2019s motion on appeal to file a supplemental brief is granted, and his other pending motions are denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b601-30\">. The Honorable Scott O.
