Principi, </em>02-245 (July 20, 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b936-24\">The Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals denied James P. McCarley\u2019s claims for financial assistance in the purchase of an automobile or other conveyance and for specially adapted housing or a special home-adaptation grant. The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims vacated the Board\u2019s decision in part and remanded the case to the Board, and the Secretary appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-25\">This case was stayed pending the court\u2019s disposition in <em>Roan v. Principi, </em>2004-7093, which was stayed pending the court\u2019s disposition in <em>Sanders v. Nicholson, </em>487 F.3d 881 (Fed.Cir.2007), and its companion case <em>Simmons v. Nicholson, </em>487 F.3d 892 (Fed. Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b936-26\">Summary affirmance of a case is appropriate \u201cwhen the position of one party is so clearly correct as a matter of law that no substantial question regarding the outcome of the appeal exists.\u201d <em>Joshua v. United States, </em>17 F.3d 378, 380 (Fed.Cir. 1994). The Secretary concedes that summary affirmance is appropriate in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-27\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b936-28\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b936-29\">(1) The stay of proceedings is lifted.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-30\">(2) The judgment of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims is summarily affirmed. The case is remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b936-31\">(3) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
