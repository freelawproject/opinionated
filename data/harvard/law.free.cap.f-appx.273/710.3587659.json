HENRY, Chief Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b738-5\">Terry Fullwiley brought suit in the United States District Court for the District of Utah alleging that his employer, Union Pacific Railroad, maintained a racially hostile work environment in violation of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of Union Pacific. On appeal, Mr. Fullwiley argues that the district court erred in holding that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>National Railroad Passenger Corp. v. Morgan, </em>536 U.S. 101, 122, 122 S.Ct. 2061, 153 L.Ed.2d 106 (2002), which held that acts outside the limitations period may be considered in a Title VII hostile environment claim, did not apply to claims asserted under \u00a7 1981. In addition, he maintains that the district court impermissibly viewed his alleged incidents of harassment in isolation and ignored material evidence in granting summary judgment. We exercise jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b738-6\">\n<em>I. BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b738-7\">Mr. Fullwiley, an African-American, began working for Union Pacific as a switch-man in the Salt Lake Service Unit in 1974. Two years later, Union Pacific promoted him to an engineer position, operating locomotives from Ogden, Utah, to Green River, Wyoming. Mr. Fullwiley remains fully employed by Union Pacific.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-10\">On July 21, 2004, Mr. Fullwiley filed a complaint in the district court alleging that, over the past twenty-five years, he was subjected to racial harassment by co-employees. The alleged harassment consisted primarily of vulgar racial epithets, the use of racial stereotypes, and, on occasion, physical and verbal altercations purportedly caused by racial animus. We initially note that many of Mr. Fullwiley\u2019s allegations are not actionable as a matter of law and that, as a result, we need not review them in detail.</p>\n<p id=\"b738-11\">A. Allegations that Are Not Actionable under \u00a7 1981</p>\n<p id=\"b738-12\">First, a large number of the allegations concern events which occurred before November 21, 1991, when Congress amended 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 to cover hostile environment claims. <em>See Witt v. Roadway Exp., </em>136 F.3d 1424, 1432 (10th Cir.1998) (explaining that \u201cThe Civil Rights Act of 1991 ... amended 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 to provide a cause of action for racial harassment\u201d and that \u201c[b]ecause the effective date of the amendment was November 21, 1991, we may consider only acts of racial animus <em>after </em>that date to establish [the plaintiffs] \u00a7 1981 claim\u201d) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b738-13\">Second, many of Mr. Fullwiley\u2019s allegations are based on hearsay statements of his co-employees (ie., statements by co-employees about what a third employee told them about racial harassment). <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"713\">*713</page-number><em>Dick v. Phone Directories Co., </em>897 F.3d 1256, 1266 n. 5 (10th Cir.2005) (concluding that the district court properly refused to consider hearsay statements of a co-employee offered by the plaintiff in a hostile environment claim); <em>Noviello v. City of Boston, </em>398 F.3d 76, 85 (1st Cir.2005) (\u201cInsofar as the plaintiff is attempting to introduce [a statement of a coworker] as evidence of <em>other </em>coworkers\u2019 harassing behavior, it is hearsay; its probative value ultimately depends on the truth of the declarant\u2019s own unsworn out-of-court utterance. It is, therefore, inadmissible.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-5\">Third, some of Mr. Fullwiley\u2019s allegations concern alleged racial harassment of other employees of which Mr. Fullwiley himself was not aware. Like the preNovember 21,1991, evidence and the hearsay statements, these allegations are also not cognizable in a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 action. <em>See Hirase-Doi v. U.S. West Commc\u2019ns, </em>61 F.3d 777, 782 (10th Cir. 1995) (explaining that the plaintiff \u201ccould not subjectively perceive [her coworker\u2019s] behavior towards others as creating a hostile work environment unless she knew about that behavior\u201d), <em>abrogated on other grounds by Burlington Indus, v. Ellerth, </em>524 U.S. 742, 118 S.Ct. 2257, 141 L.Ed.2d 633 (1998) and <em>Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, </em>524 U.S. 775, 118 S.Ct. 2275, 141 L.Ed.2d 662 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-6\">Fourth, Mr. Fullwiley is unable to provide even an approximate date for a few of the alleged incidents of harassment. As a result, we do not consider these allegations either. <em>See Ford v. West, </em>222 F.3d 767, 777 (10th Cir.2000) (affirming summary judgment in a Title VII hostile environment case where plaintiffs claims were \u201cvague and conclusory, without reference to specific dates or circumstances\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-7\">Finally, in his appellate brief, Mr. Fullwiley advances allegations of harassment that were not made to the district court. We also decline to consider these allegations. <em>See Carpenter v. Boeing Co., </em>456 F.3d 1183, 1198 n. 2 (10th Cir.2006) (\u201cWe will not address the [issue], because our general rule is not to address arguments that were not first presented to the district court....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b739-9\">B. <em>Morgan </em>and the four-year limitations period for \u00a7 1981 claims</p>\n<p id=\"b739-10\">With that evidence excluded, we divide Mr. Fullwiley\u2019s allegations into two periods: (a) the period from the amendment of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 to cover hostile environment claims (November 21, 1991) until July 21, 2000; (b) the period from July 21, 2000, until July 21, 2004 \u2014 the date that Mr. Fullwiley filed his \u00a7 1981 complaint in the district court. That division is based upon \u00a7 1981\u2019s four-year statute of limitations and the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Morgan.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b739-11\">In <em>Morgan, </em>the Court considered a hostile environment claim filed under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-l <em>et seq. </em>The Court held that \u201cconsideration of the entire scope of a [Title VII] racially hostile work environment claim, <em>including behavior alleged outside the statutory time period, </em>is permissible for the purposes of assessing liability, so long as an act contributing to that hostile environment takes place within the statutory time period.\u201d 536 U.S. at 105, 122 S.Ct. 2061 (emphasis added). The Court based its holding on the principle that \u201cthe entire hostile work environment encompasses a single unlawful employment practice\u201d and that \u201c[Title VII] does not separate individual acts that are part of the hostile environment claim from the whole for the purpose of timely filing and liability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 117-18, 122 S.Ct. 2061.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"714\">*714</page-number>The Seventh, Eighth, and Eleventh Circuits have concluded that <em>Morgan\u2019s </em>analysis of the Title VII statute of limitations for hostile environment claims should be applied to \u00a7 1981 hostile environment claims as well. <em>See Dandy v. United Parcel Serv., Inc., </em>388 F.3d 263, 270 (7th Cir. 2004) (stating that \u201cif a plaintiff alleges \u2018continuing violations,\u2019 which constitute a pattern and practice of discrimination, we may look outside of the relevant time period\u201d and that \u201c[t]his doctrine applies to Title VII as well as \u00a7 1981 claims\u201d); <em>Madison v. IBP, Inc., </em>330 F.3d 1051, 1061 (8th Cir.2003) (holding that <em>Morgan </em>applies to \u00a7 1981 claims and reasoning that \u201c[b]e-cause \u00a7 1981 allows for recovery for the same type of employment discrimination as Title VII, we believe that the distinction between discrete acts and hostile work environment claims should have equal effect on the respective recovery periods for the two statutes\u201d); <em>Shields v. Fort James Corp., </em>305 F.3d 1280, 1282-83 (11th Cir. 2002) (holding that a \u00a7 1981 claim alleging that an employer \u201chas allowed a racially hostile work environment to prosper embodies a single violation of an employee\u2019s right to \u2018the enjoyment of all benefits, privileges, terms, and conditions of the contractual relationship\u2019 and, therefore, should be reviewed in its entirety if any part of this allegation falls within the statute of limitations period\u201d) (quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981).</p>\n<p id=\"b740-4\">In our recent decision in <em>Tademy v. Union Pacific Corp., </em>520 F.3d 1149 (10th Cir.2008) we agreed with those courts, holding that \u201cconsideration of the entire scope of a [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981] racially hostile work environment claim, including behavior alleged outside the statutory time period, is permissible for the purposes of assessing liability, so long as an act contributing to that hostile environment takes place within the statutory time period.\u201d <em>Tademy, </em>520 F.3d at 1172 (quoting <em>Morgan, </em>536 U.S. at 105, 122 S.Ct. 2061). Thus, because Mr. Fullwiley has alleged acts of racial harassment within the four-year limitations period (July 21, 2000, to July 21, 2004), we will consider certain allegations of harassment before that period as well. Even so, we conclude that the district court properly granted summary judgment to Union Pacific on Mr. Fullwiley\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">C. Incidents Occurring from November 21, 1991, until July 21, 2000</p>\n<p id=\"b740-7\">Drawing all reasonable inferences in his favor, as this procedural posture requires, <em>MacKenzie v. City &amp; County of Denver, </em>414 F.3d 1266, 1273 (10th Cir.2005), and excluding the five categories of evidence noted above, Mr. Fullwiley alleged the following incidents of harassment during this period:</p>\n<p id=\"b740-8\">1. In the early to mid-1990s, a co-employee, Layne Heiner, made several comments to Mr. Fullwiley expressing the view that all African-American men have large penises. For example, when Mr. Fullwiley returned from the bathroom Mr. Heiner asked, \u201cDid you get it wet?---[D]id you get it blue?____ Did it drag in the dirt?\u201d Aplt\u2019s App. vol. Ill, at 889. Mr. Fullwiley told Mr. Heiner that he was using racial stereotypes and asked him not to do so. Mr. Fullwiley did not complain to management about Mr. Heiner\u2019s crude remarks. Moreover, Mr. Fullwiley stated in his deposition, Mr. Heiner never said anything offensive to him again.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-12\">2. Sometime before 1995, Mr. Fullwiley saw the word \u201cnigger\u201d written on a train. Aplt\u2019s App. vol. I, at 202. However, he did not report it. Mr. Fullwiley did not personally observe any graffiti written on bathroom walls. <em>Id. </em>However, a co-employee named Harry Price saw the words <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"715\">*715</page-number>\u201c[n]o niggers here\u201d, \u201cKKK\u201d, \u201c[g]o home, boy[,]\u201d and \u201ca circle with an \u2018N\u2019 in it\u201d in the bathroom in the north yard shanty. Aplt\u2019s App. vol. Ill, at 938. He told Mr. Fullwiley that this graffiti had been there for years. Mr. Price added that he had not seen any more graffiti on the bathroom walls since 2002. He further stated that he had reported the graffiti to a manager of yard operations about the time that the lawsuit was filed.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-5\">3. Sometime between 1995 and 1997, co-employee Ralph Niau observed manager of yard operations Steve Austin berating Mr. Fullwiley. According to Mr. Niau, Mr. Fullwiley had reported a violation of a company rule and Mr. Austin responded by telling Mr. Fullwiley to \u201cget his ... black ass ... [b]ack on the units.\u201d Aplt\u2019s App. vol. IV, at 1121-22. After Mr. Fullwiley left, Mr. Austin said, \u201cWho does that n[igger] guy think he is?\u201d and called him a \u201ccocksucker\u201d and \u201ca no good motherf* * *er.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1122-23. Neither Mr. Fullwiley nor Mr. Niau reported those comments, nor is there any indication in this record that Mr. Niau told Mr. Fullwiley about the additional slurs uttered by Mr. Austin after Mr. Fullwiley left.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-6\">4. In April 1999, another co-employee, Ray Peterson put his hands on Mr. Fullwiley\u2019s shoulders and \u201cstart[ed] squeezing [Mr. Fullwiley], digging [Mr. Peterson\u2019s] fingers into this little divot between [Mr. Fullwiley\u2019s] collarbone and [his] neck area.\u201d Aplt\u2019s App. vol. I, at 222. Mr. Fullwiley tried \u201cto shake him off.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Mr. Peterson released Mr. Fullwiley and then grabbed him from behind and pinned Mr. Fullwiley\u2019s arms to the side of his body. Mr. Fullwiley did not want to be confrontational, and so, when Mr. Peterson released him, he walked out of the shanty where the incident had occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-7\">In November 1999, Mr. Fullwiley reported the incident to supervisor Greg No-land. When Mr. Noland asked Mr. Fullwiley if the incident was racially motivated, Mr. Fullwiley said that he hoped not. However, he related a remark that Mr. Peterson had made sometime before the incident. According to Mr. Fullwiley, Mr. Peterson said, \u201cMy mother says that anybody can beat a nigger.\u201d Aplt\u2019s App. vol. IV, at 1228. Additionally, Mr. Fullwiley stated that he heard Mr. Peterson tell another employee that he would get another employee to \u201ckick [an African American coworker\u2019s] black ass.\u201d Aplt\u2019s App. vol. I, at 166.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-9\">Union Pacific held a disciplinary hearings for Mr. Peterson (for the alleged assault) and for Mr. Fullwiley (for failing to timely report an injury). At Mr. Peterson\u2019s hearing, one witness described Mr. Peterson making a \u201cfriendly gesture\u201d toward Mr. Fullwiley. Aplt\u2019s App. vol. II, at 686. The superintendent found the evidence insufficient to warrant discipline against Mr. Peterson. In contrast, the superintendent concluded that Mr. Fullwiley had reported the injury late in violation of the company\u2019s rules and found that he had committed a level-two infraction.</p>\n<p id=\"b741-10\">D. Incidents occurring between July 21, 2000, and July 21, 2004</p>\n<p id=\"b741-11\">Drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of Mr. Fullwiley, and excluding the five categories of evidence noted above, Mr. Fullwiley alleged the following incidents of harassment from July 21, 2000, to July 21, 2004:</p>\n<p id=\"b741-12\">1. In December 2000, a co-worker, Darrel Tuhoski, spoke with Mr. Fullwiley regarding his suspicions that Mr. Tuhoski\u2019s wife was having an affair with a Union Pacific employee named Terry. Mr. Tuhoski told Mr. Fullwiley, \u201cIf I would have caught you two together I would have killed you.\u201d Aplt\u2019s App. vol. I, at 211. At some point during the exchange, Mr. Full<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"716\">*716</page-number>wiley asked Mr. Tuhoski whether the alleged adulterer was \u201ca black guy.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 209. Mr. Fullwiley reported the incident to his manager and to a railroad police officer who investigated the alleged threat. Union Pacific did not ultimately take any action against Mr. Tuhoski, but Mr. Fullwiley admits \u201cthat he had no further problems with Mr. Tuhoski because he died.\u201d Aplt\u2019s Br. at 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-4\">2. In 2000 or 2001, Mr. Fullwiley and two co-workers were reading a rule book when Mr. Fullwiley disagreed with one of the co-workers, Mr. J.D. Smith, about the meaning of a rule. Mr. Smith told Mr. Fullwiley, \u201cit doesn\u2019t read like that, boy.\u201d Aplt\u2019s App. vol. I, at 138. Mr. Smith\u2019s use of the word \u201cboy\u201d offended Mr. Fullwiley.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-5\">3. Around the same time, Mr. Fullwiley was boarding a Union Pacific bus or van from Nevada when a co-worker told him he would have to sit in the back because the front was full. Everybody on the bus laughed, and Mr. Fullwiley, who believed that the remark was a reference to Jim Crow laws, became upset.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-6\">4. Again, during approximately the same time, Mr. Fullwiley was boarding another bus when the driver, who was white, told Mr. Fullwiley that in California \u201cwhite guys\u201d who were friends with \u201cblack guys\u201d used to greet them with the phrase, \u201cHow you doing, my main nigger?\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 284. Mr. Fullwiley told the bus driver that he was offended, and the bus driver never again referred to Mr. Fullwiley using the epithet.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-7\">5. In 2005, an employee found Mr. Fullwiley sleeping on a train in Ogden, Utah, and woke him by telling Mr. Fullwiley to \u201c[r]ise and shine, Sunshine.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 282. Mr. Fullwiley contends that the employee referred to him as \u201csunshine\u201d \u201ctwo or three times.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 283. The employee made no reference to race, and Mr. Fullwiley never informed the employee that he found the term offensive. Mr. Fullwiley did not report any of these incidents to Union Pacific management.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-9\">6. In 2002, a Union Pacific employee, Charlie White, gained access to a superintendent\u2019s e-mail account and sent out an away message urging a significant number of Union Pacific employees to \u201ckeep an eye on the slaves ... seriously.\u201d Aplt\u2019s App. vol. II, at 485. Union Pacific terminated Mr. White for that conduct. Mr. Fullwiley claims to have heard about the e-mail around the time it was sent, but he never saw it until his attorneys showed it to him when this litigation was pending in 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-10\">7. In the summer of 2003,' Mr. Fullwiley learned that an African-American coworker, Ranee Tademy, found a noose hanging above a clock in the Union Pacific workplace. Mr. Tademy reported the incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-11\">E. Procedural History</p>\n<p id=\"b742-12\">Mr. Fullwiley filed suit against Union Pacific on July 21, 2004, alleging that he had been subjected to a racially hostile work environment in violation of \u00a7 1981. He also sought damages for negligent infliction of emotional distress under the Federal Employers Liability Act (FELA), 45 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 51-60, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. The district court granted Union Pacific\u2019s motion for summary judgment on all of Mr. Fullwiley\u2019s claims. In this appeal, Mr. Fullwiley challenges only the grant of summary judgment on his \u00a7 1981 claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b742-13\">As to that claim, the district court first concluded that it could consider only the acts of racial harassment alleged by Mr. Fullwiley that occurred within the \u00a7 1981 limitations period. It reasoned that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Morgan, </em>a Title VII case, was inapplicable to Mr. Fullwiley\u2019s \u00a7 1981 claim. The district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>court also refused to consider hearsay statements concerning the alleged harassment. <em>See </em>Aplt\u2019s App. vol. V at 1843, 1852-53 (stating that \u201c \u2018a third party\u2019s description of [a witness\u2019] supposed testimony is not suitable grist for the summary judgment mill\u2019 \u201d) (quoting <em>Gross v. Burggraf, </em>53 F.3d 1531, 1541 (10th Cir.1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b743-5\">The court then reviewed the admissible evidence of harassment with the four-year limitations period and concluded that Mr. Fullwiley\u2019s allegations did not support his claim that he had been subjected to severe or pervasive harassment because of his race. The court further noted that Mr. Fullwiley had reported only one of the alleged incidents of harassment that occurred within the limitations period and that Union Pacific had taken adequate remedial action. Accordingly, Mr. Fullwiley had also failed to establish that Union Pacific should be held liable for the alleged harassment under the agency principles governing employer liability in hostile environment claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b743-7\">On appeal, Mi*. Fullwiley, along with <em>amicus curiae, </em>the National Employment Lawyers Association, contends that the district court mistakenly concluded that <em>Morgan </em>does not apply to \u00a7 1981 claims, thereby erroneously excluding pre-July 21, 2000, incidents from his claim. He also contends that the court erred in viewing each incident \u201cin a factual vacuum\u201d and that the district court impermissibly failed to take evidence into consideration by \u201cerroneously concluding they were not racial, that they were inadmissible, or simply ignoring them without explanation.\u201d Aplt\u2019s Br. at 29. In addition, Mr. Fullwiley maintains that the court drew factual inferences in favor of Union Pacific in contravention of the summary judgment standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-8\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b743-9\">\u201cWe review the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same standard as the district court.\u201d <em>Butler v. Compton, </em>482 F.3d 1277, 1278 (10th Cir.2007). Summary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). We examine the record and all reasonable inferences that might be drawn from it in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. <em>MacKenzie, </em>414 F.3d at 1273.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-10\">B. The Framework for Analyzing a Hostile Environment Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b743-11\">Our review of Mr. Fullwiley\u2019s hostile environment claim proceeds in three steps. \u201cOur first task ... is to determine if there is a genuine issue whether the acts [Mr. Fullwiley] alleges are part of the same hostile work environment.\u201d <em>Duncan v. Manager, Dep\u2019t of Safety, City &amp; County of Denver, </em>397 F.3d 1300, 1309 (10th Cir. 2005) (applying <em>Morgan </em>to a hostile environment claim filed under Title VII). We must examine \u201cthe type of these acts, the frequency of the acts, and the perpetrator of the acts.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The harassment must be \u201cracial or stem[ ] from racial animus.\u201d <em>Witt, </em>136 F.3d at 1432 (internal quotation marks omitted). And at least one of those acts must have occurred within the limitations period.</p>\n<p id=\"b743-12\">Second, if we conclude that Mr. Fullwiley\u2019s claims are sufficiently related, we must evaluate whether he has presented evidence from which a reasonable jury could conclude that \u201cthe harassment was pervasive or severe enough to alter the terms, conditions, or privilege of employ<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"718\">*718</page-number>ment.\u201d <em>Bolden v. PRC, Inc., </em>43 F.3d 545, 551 (10th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-4\">Third, we consider whether Mr. Fullwiley has presented evidence sufficient to give rise to a reasonable inference that Union Pacific\u2019s response to the incidents of which it was apprised was inadequate. <em>See Adler v. Wal-Mart Stores, </em>144 F.3d 664, 673-76 (10th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-5\">As to the third inquiry, we note that employers are not automatically liable under Title VII for the conduct of employees that creates a hostile work environment. However, \u201csince the employer ultimately controls the conditions of the work environment[,]\u201d our cases hold that \u201c[a]n employer who condones or tolerates the creation of [a hostile work] environment should be held liable.\u201d <em>Lockard v. Pizza Hut, </em>162 F.3d 1062, 1073-74 (10th Cir. 1998) (internal citations and quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b744-6\">In examining the responsibility of employers, we look to agency principles. <em>Hollins v. Delta Airlines, </em>238 F.3d 1255, 1258 (10th Cir.2001). Under our precedent, employers may be held liable for the racially harassing conduct of employees under three theories: \u201c[1] the negligence theory, under which the employer fails to remedy a hostile work environment it knew or should have known about; [2] the actual authority theory, under which an employee harasses another employee within the scope of his employment; or [3] the apparent authority theory, under which the harassing employee acts with apparent authority from the employer.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted). Here, Mr. Fullwiley alleges that Union Pacific was negligent in failing to remedy the alleged harassment.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-7\">C. Union Pacific\u2019s Response</p>\n<p id=\"b744-8\">In our view, it is a close question whether Mr. Fullwiley has presented evidence sufficient to support the first two of these components: (1) that the acts he alleges are part of the same hostile work environment, and (2) that the harassment was pervasive or severe enough to alter the terms, conditions, or privilege of his employment. However, we need not resolve these questions here. Assuming arguendo that the acts he alleges are part of the same hostile work environment and that Mr. Fullwiley has offered evidence that he was subjected to severe or pervasive harassment, he has failed to offer evidence supporting his contention that the company may be held liable for the alleged harassment under a negligence theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-10\">\u201cBecause an employer is only potentially liable for negligence in remedying and preventing harassment of which it negligently failed to discover, courts must make two inquiries: first into the employer\u2019s actual or constructive knowledge of harassment, and second, into the adequacy of the employer\u2019s remedial and preventative responses to any actually or constructively known harassment.\u201d <em>Adler, </em>144 F.3d at 673.</p>\n<p id=\"b744-11\">\u201cActual knowledge will be demonstrable in most cases where the plaintiff has reported harassment to management-level employees.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When a management-level employee has not been notified, this court applies what amounts to a \u201cnegligence standard: highly pervasive harassment should, in the exercise of reasonable care, be discovered by management-level employees.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b744-12\">If the employer has received actual or constructive notice of a hostile work environment, then the court must determine whether its response was adequate. The test is \u201cwhether the remedial and preventative action [is] reasonably calculated to end the harassment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 676 (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cA stoppage of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"719\">*719</page-number>harassment shows effectiveness, which in turn evidences such reasonable calculation. However, this is not the sole factor to be considered. Because there is no strict liability and an employer must only respond reasonably, a response may be so calculated even though the perpetrator might persist.\u201d <em>Id. </em>A plaintiff who argues that continuing harassment demonstrates the inadequacy of the employer\u2019s response must offer evidence of \u201ca nexus between a[n employer\u2019s] prior response and later harassment by others....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 678.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-5\">Here, out of the alleged acts of harassment within the limitations period, Mr. Fullwiley reported only one, the confrontation with Mr. Tuhoski. As we have noted, the record does not support Mr. Fullwiley\u2019s claim that the incident involved racial animus. Moreover, Union Pacific and the railroad police investigated the matter, and apparently determined that Mr. Tuhoski\u2019s threat, to the extent that his statement could be construed as one, was not sincere. Further, Mr. Fullwiley does not allege to have been the victim of any further racially-charged threats from Mr. Tuhoski or any other employee.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-6\">As to the other alleged acts of harassment that are actionable, the record indicates that there were two instances in which Union Pacific was notified: Mr. Fullwiley reported the assault by Mr. Peterson, and Mr. Price reported graffiti on bathroom walls. However, in neither instance has Mr. Fullwiley offered evidence indicating that Union Pacific\u2019s response to the complaints was so inadequate as to render the company liable.</p>\n<p id=\"b745-7\">As to Mr. Fullwiley\u2019s complaint about Mr. Peterson, Union Pacific did respond. The company conducted an investigation, held a hearing, and determined that the evidence was not sufficient to support Mr. Fullwiley\u2019s allegations. There is no evidence indicating a nexus between that response and the subsequent harassment alleged by Mr. Fullwiley. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b745-9\">As to Mr. Price\u2019s complaints about the graffiti on the bathrooms walls, we acknowledge that in certain instances a company\u2019s failure to respond to such matters may support a hostile environment claim. <em>See Jackson v. Quanex Corp., </em>191 F.3d 647, 668-64 (6th Cir.1999) (discussing the fact that an employer \u201cwas slow to eliminate racially offensive graffiti when it learned of it, and made no effort to discover the perpetrators\u201d; noting that, as a result of the employer\u2019s failure to respond \u201cthe graffiti continued throughout the entire period of time that [the plaintiff] worked [for the employer]\u201d; and concluding that \u201c[t]hese were not actions reasonably calculated to end racially offensive conduct\u201d). However, in this case, Mr. Fullwiley has failed to establish a nexus between the company\u2019s response to Mr. Price\u2019s complaints and the harassment that he experienced. In particular, Mr. Fullwiley testified that he had never seen graffiti on the bathroom walls and that the only graffiti that he had seen was the word \u201cnigger\u201d written on a train sometime around 1995. This evidence is insufficient to show a nexus between Mr. Price\u2019s complaints and the hostile environment alleged by Mr. Fullwiley. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b745-10\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b745-11\">We therefore AFFIRM the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Union Pacific.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b738-8\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata and collateral estoppel.
