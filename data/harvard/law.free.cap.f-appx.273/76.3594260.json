May 21, 2007), <em>aff'g </em>No. A98 353 671 (Immig. Ct. N.Y. City Oct. 3, 2005). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts of this case, its procedural posture, and the decision below.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-20\">The IJ made an adverse credibility determination, which the BIA adopted and supplemented. Accordingly, we review the decision of the IJ as adopted and supplemented by the BIA. <em>Yan Chen v. Gonzales, </em>417 F.3d 268, 271 (2d Cir.2005). This Court reviews the IJ\u2019s factual findings, including adverse credibility determinations, under the substantial evidence standard, meaning that the IJ\u2019s findings must be upheld \u201cunless we conclude that a reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d <em>Zhou Yun Zhang v. INS, </em>386 F.3d 66, 73 (2d Cir.2004), <em>overruled, in part on other grounds by Shi Liang Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>494 F.3d 296, 309 (2d Cir.2007); <em>see also </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B) (codifying this standard). We will, however, vacate and remand for new findings if the agency\u2019s reasoning or its fact-finding process was sufficiently flawed. <em>See Cao He Lin v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>428 F.3d 391, 406 (2d Cir.2005). Here, we conclude that the IJ found facts adequate to support her adverse credibility determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-21\">Accordingly, we DENY the petition for review.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
