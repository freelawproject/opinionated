Thus, the appeal is submitted on the briefs and the record. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b575-23\">ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b575-24\">Kathy Perry pleaded guilty to conspiracy to distribute crack cocaine. <em>See </em>21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 846, 841(a)(1). In December 2005 she was sentenced to 10 years\u2019 imprisonment, the statutory minimum since the offense involved at least five grams. <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 841(b)(l)(B)(iii). At sentencing the prosecutor told the district court that Perry had provided information about a fugitive coconspirator, and that the government anticipated filing a post-sentence motion for a reduced sentence if he was arrested and prosecuted. <em>See </em>Fed. R.Crim.P. 35(b). The government never filed a Rule 35(b) motion, so Perry, by then pro se, filed one herself more than a year after sentencing. The district court denied Perry\u2019s motion because she received the statutory minimum, the government had not moved to reduce that term, and it was too late \u2014 so the court thought\u2014 for the government to file a motion under Rule 35(b). Perry appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b575-25\">Rule 35(b) authorizes a district court to reduce a sentence for substantial assistance only\u201cupon the government\u2019s motion.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 35(b)(1); <em>see Wade v. Unit</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number><em>ed States, </em>504 U.S. 181, 185-86, 112 S.Ct. 1840, 118 L.Ed.2d 524 (1992). The government must act within a year of sentencing unless the defendant\u2019s information was not known or did not become useful until later. Fed.R.CrimP. 35(b)(2). Here, the government has yet to file a Rule 35(b) motion for Perry\u2019s substantial assistance. And Perry did not allege any breach of promise, unconstitutional motive, or bad faith on the government\u2019s part. <em>See Wade, </em>504 U.S. at 185-87, 112 S.Ct. 1840; <em>United States v. Wilson, </em>390 F.3d 1003, 1011-13 (7th Cir. 2004). The district court in this case thus had no choice but to deny Perry\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b576-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
