Jones appeals his convictions and 150-month sentence for possession with intent to distribute cocaine base, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) (2000), and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1) (2000). Counsel for Jones filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), in which he asserts that there are no meritorious issues for appeal, but asks this court to review whether Jones\u2019 sentence is unreasonable in light of <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), and the subsequent amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines regarding offenses involving cocaine base. In response, the Government filed a motion to dismiss based upon the waiver of appellate rights in Jones\u2019 plea agreement. Jones filed a pro se supplemental brief in which he contended that his counsel was ineffective in litigating his motion to suppress.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b268-23\">Pursuant to a plea agreement, a defendant may waive his appellate rights under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742 (2000). <em>United States v. Wiggins, </em>905 F.2d 51, 53 (4th Cir.1990). Whether a defendant has waived his right to appeal is an issue of law subject to de novo review. <em>United States v. Marin, </em>961 F.2d 493, 496 (4th Cir.1992). A waiver will preclude appeal of a specific issue if the record establishes that the waiver is valid and that the issue is within the scope of that waiver. <em>United States v. Attar, </em>38 F.3d 727, 731-33 (4th Cir.1994); <em>cf. United States v. Blick, </em>408 F.3d 162, 171 (4th Cir.2005) (refusing to enforce waiver for a \u201cnarrow class of claims\u201d that are not within the scope of the waiver).</p>\n<p id=\"b268-24\">In his <em>Anders </em>brief, Jones contends his sentence is unreasonable in light of amendments to the Sentencing Guidelines for offenses involving cocaine base and the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Kimbrough. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"243\">*243</page-number>However, these claims are squarely within the scope of the appellate waiver, as Jones waived his right to appeal any sentence below the statutory maximum \u201con any ground.\u201d <em>See Blick, </em>408 F.3d at 172-73. Accordingly, Jones\u2019 claims in regard to his sentence are barred by the appellate waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-5\">In his pro se supplemental brief, Jones claims his trial counsel was ineffective in litigating his motion to suppress. Such claims of ineffective assistance of counsel are not barred by the appellate waiver; however, these claims should be raised in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 (2000) motion rather than on direct appeal unless the record conclusively demonstrates ineffective assistance. <em>See United States v. King, </em>119 F.3d 290, 295 (4th Cir.1997). Such a claim cannot be fairly adjudicated on direct appeal when the appellant has not raised the issue before the district court and there is no statement from counsel on the record. <em>United States v. DeFusco, </em>949 F.2d 114, 120-21 (4th Cir.1991). The existing record does not conclusively support Jones\u2019 claims regarding ineffective assistance of counsel. Accordingly, these claims must be raised as part of a \u00a7 2255 motion rather than on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-6\">Accordingly, we grant the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss as to Jones\u2019 sentencing claims. As for Jones\u2019 pro se claims that he received ineffective assistance of counsel, we deny the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss as to those claims, but nonetheless affirm Jones\u2019 convictions. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b269-7\">\n<em>DISMISSED IN PART; AFFIRMED IN PART.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b268-18\"> We grant Jones\u2019 motion for an extension of time and deem his pro se brief to be timely filed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
