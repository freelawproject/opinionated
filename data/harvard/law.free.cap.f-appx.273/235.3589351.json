We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing Blackshear and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-13\">In the presentence report (PSR), the probation officer recommended a base offense level of thirty-two for the drug counts pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(USSG) \u00a7 2Dl.l(e)(4) (2005). The Guidelines term on Count Five was the statutory minimum of sixty months consecutive, pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2K2.4. The base offense level for Count Six was twenty-four pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2), but the cross-reference to USSG \u00a7 2D1.1 applied, so he base offense level became thirty-two. Blackshear\u2019s pri- or convictions qualified him for sentencing as a career offender, and mandated an offense level of thirty-seven. After a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, Blackshear\u2019s total offense level for Counts One through Four and Six was thirty-four.</p>\n<p id=\"b262-14\">Because he was a career offender, Blackshear was in criminal history category VI. Offense level thirty-four and criminal history category VI yielded a sentencing range of 262 to 327 months for Counts One through Four and Six, plus a consecutive sixty months on Count Five, for a total Guidelines range of 322 to 387 months. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>Because Count Four involved fifty grams of cocaine base, and the Government filed a 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 851 (2000) information establishing two prior felony drug convictions, Blackshear was subject to a statutory mandatory sentence of life imprisonment, plus five years consecutive on Count Five.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-5\">Prior to sentencing, the Government moved for a downward departure pursuant to USSG \u00a7 5K1.1 and 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(e) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2007). The Government requested a sentence of 262 months on the drug counts and a consecutive sixty months on Count Five, for a total of 322 months of imprisonment. Black-shear did not object to the PSR, which the court adopted without change. The court accepted the Government\u2019s motion for a departure. Blackshear\u2019s counsel stated that he accepted the Government\u2019s motion as to the Guidelines, then argued for a variance below the sentence recommended by the Government in the departure motion. The district court noted the advisory Guidelines and the 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2007) factors and sentenced Blackshear to 322 months of imprisonment, ten years of supervised release, and a $600 special assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-6\">On appeal, Blackshear argues that the district court failed to make proper findings regarding the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and the factors supporting a departure under \u00a7 5K1.1 and \u00a7 3553(e), and that the court erred in failing to consider a lesser sentence based on the crack-to-powder cocaine disparity, anticipating the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007). We review a district court\u2019s sentence for reasonableness under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In this case, the district court explicitly treated the Guidelines as advisory, and sentenced Blackshear only after considering the Sentencing Guidelines, the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the Government\u2019s departure motion, and counsel\u2019s arguments. Although the district court did not recite facts to support each \u00a7 3553(a) factor, the court need not \u201crobotically tick through \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s every subsection\u201d or \u201cexplicitly discuss every \u00a7 3553(a) factor on the record.\u201d <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 345 (4th Cir.2006). Our review of the record leads us to conclude that the district court properly considered the sentencing factors, and did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the sentence recommended by the Government was appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-12\">The Supreme Court recently decided, in <em>Kimbrough, </em>that \u201cit would not be an abuse of discretion for a district court to conclude when sentencing a particular defendant that the crack/powder disparity yields a sentence \u2018greater than necessary\u2019 to achieve \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s purposes, even in a mine-run case.\u201d 128 S.Ct. at 575. We conclude, however, that <em>Kimbrough </em>is of no assistance to Blackshear because his ultimate Guidelines range was not determined based on drug quantity, but on his status as a career offender. Accordingly, the district court did not err in failing to consider the crack-to-powder cocaine disparity as a basis for imposing a lower sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-13\">We therefore affirm Blackshear\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b263-14\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
