Following careful review, we conclude that the district court\u2019s section 4245 finding was supported by the unrefuted opinion of the mental health professionals at the Federal Medical Center in Rochester, Minnesota, and was not clearly erroneous, notwithstanding Barr\u2019s denial of mental illness. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 4245(d) (determination of mental illness and treatment need, and burden of proof); <em>United States v. Bean, </em>373 F.3d 877, 879 (8th Cir.2004) (standard of review); <em>United States v. Eckerson, </em>299 F.3d 913, 914-15 (8th Cir.2002) (per curiam) (upholding commitment order based on opinion of prison hospital staff, despite inmate\u2019s denial of mental illness).</p>\n<p id=\"b598-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the district court, grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, and deny Barr\u2019s motion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b598-8\">.
