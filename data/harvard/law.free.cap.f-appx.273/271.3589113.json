Thigpen appeals the district court\u2019s summary dismissal of his pro se complaint, filed against several Virginia officials under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. Thigpen\u2019s complaint alleges various conspiracies to violate his constitutional rights. The district court dismissed Thigpen\u2019s complaint under <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), without prejudice and with leave to refile his claims in a petition for habeas corpus. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Thigpen\u2019s double jeopardy claim under <em>Heck. </em>In addition, we affirm on alternative grounds the dismissal without prejudice of Thigpen\u2019s other claims, and we modify the district court\u2019s order to allow Thigpen to refile these claims under \u00a7 1983.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">Thigpen was convicted of rape in 1983 and was released from prison in 1996. As a result of his conviction Thigpen was required to comply with the Virginia Sex Offender and Crimes Against Minors Registry Act, Va.Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 9.1-900 to -921 (the Act), upon his release. The Act includes various registration and reporting requirements. Failure to comply with the Act\u2019s requirements carries a criminal penalty. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 18.2-472.1. Thigpen failed to comply with the Act, and on July 20, 2004, he was sentenced to four years of supervised probation. Thigpen continued in his failure to comply with the Act, and on October 17, 2005, his probation was revoked, and he was sentenced to a four year prison term. Thigpen subsequently filed this action under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. His complaint contained conclusory allegations that various state officials (the defendants) \u201ccommitted conspiracy\u201d to subject him to double jeopardy and violate his due process, equal protection, and First Amendment rights by \u201cattach[ing] two additional punishments against plaintiff,\u201d \u201clabeling plaintiff to be a violent sex offender,\u201d and posting his identifying information on the internet. J.A. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">On August 30, 2006, the district court dismissed Thigpen\u2019s claims without prejudice and with leave to refile a petition for habeas corpus in state court. The district court concluded that \u201cwhere, as here, the complaint attacks the fact or duration of confinement, the appropriate remedy is a writ of habeas corpus, not a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983,\u201d relying on <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). J.A. 13. Thigpen filed this timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">In <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994), the Supreme Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b298-11\">[Wjhen a state prisoner seeks damages in a \u00a7 1983 suit, the district court must consider whether a judgment in favor of the plaintiff would necessarily imply the invalidity of his conviction or sentence; if it would, the complaint must be dismissed unless the plaintiff can demonstrate that the conviction or sentence has already been invalidated. But if the district court determines that the plaintiffs action, even if successful, will not demonstrate the invalidity of any outstanding criminal judgment against the plaintiff, the action should be allowed to proceed____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b298-12\"><em>Id. </em>at 487, 114 S.Ct. 2364. A district court must undertake a case specific analysis to determine whether success on the claims would necessarily imply the invalidity of a conviction or sentence. <em>See Edwards v. Balisok, </em>520 U.S. 641, 117 S.Ct. 1584, 137 L.Ed.2d 906 (1997); <em>Muhammad v. Close, </em>540 U.S. 749, 124 S.Ct. 1303, 158 L.Ed.2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>82 (2004); <em>Heck, </em>512 U.S. at 487, 114 S.Ct. 2364.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-5\">Here, the district court explained that Thigpen \u201cessentially attacks the validity of his conviction and the length of his confinement claiming that the defendants imposed \u2018two additional punishments\u2019 against him.\u201d J.A. 13. We agree that Thigpen\u2019s double jeopardy claim is barred by <em>Heck. </em>The complaint alleges \u201ctwo additional punishments\u201d and references the \u201cindictment ... dated October 17, 2005,\u201d J.A. 8, the date that Thigpen\u2019s probation was revoked for his continued violation of the Act. If Thigpen were successful on this challenge, the invalidation of his current sentence would necessarily result. Therefore, the appropriate vehicle for relief on Thigpen\u2019s double jeopardy claim is a petition for a writ of habeas corpus or a criminal appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">In dismissing the complaint under <em>Heck, </em>the district court did not consider Thigpen\u2019s due process, equal protection, or First Amendment claims. The defendants concede that these claims are not barred by <em>Heck, </em>and thus should not have been dismissed by the district court on this ground. The defendants argue, however, that the complaint should be dismissed because it fails to meet minimum pleading requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 8(a)(2) requires \u201ca short and plain statement of the claim showing that the pleader is entitled to relief.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 8(a)(2). The complaint must \u201cgive the defendant fair notice of what the claim is and the grounds upon which it rests.\u201d <em>Erickson v. Pardus, </em>- U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2197, 2200, 167 L.Ed.2d 1081 (2007) (per curiam) (quoting <em>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 1955,1964,167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)) (internal alterations and quotation marks omitted). A pro se complaint \u201c \u2018must be held to less stringent standards than formal pleadings drafted by lawyers.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Estelle v. Gamble, </em>429 U.S. 97, 106, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d 251 (1976)). Nonetheless, \u201ca plaintiffs obligation to provide the grounds of his entitlement to relief requires more than labels and conclusions, and a formulaic recitation of the elements of a cause of action will not do.\u201d <em>Twombly, </em>127 S.Ct. at 1964-65 (internal alternations and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b299-13\">Applying these standards, we conclude that Thigpen\u2019s complaint did not contain the factual information necessary to state a claim for relief. Each of Thigpen\u2019s allegations begins with a claim of conspiracy, but his complaint contains no facts to either support such a claim or, alternatively, to indicate that he did not actually intend to allege conspiracy. The complaint further alleges violations of due process, equal protection, and the First Amendment, but fails to provide any explanation of the substance of these claims. The complaint thus provides no information about Thigpen\u2019s injury or his entitlement to relief, and should, as a result, be dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-14\">In sum, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Thigpen\u2019s double jeopardy claim with leave to file a state petition for habeas corpus. While the district court erred in dismissing Thigpen\u2019s equal protection, due process, and First Amendment claims pursuant to <em>Heck, </em>we conclude that these claims should be dismissed without prejudice on the alternative ground that the complaint is so conclusory that it fails to state a claim for relief. We thus modify the district court\u2019s order to allow Thigpen to refile his equal protection, due process, and First Amendment claims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 in U.S. district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-15\">\n<em>AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
