Count One charged Allman arid his co-conspirators with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute a quantity of methamphetamine, in violation of 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7\u00a7 841 and 846 (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2007). According to the indictment, the conspiracy involved at least 1.5 kilograms of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of methamphetamine. Count Two charged Allman and others with using a communication facility in committing or causing the acts alleged in Count One, in violation of 21 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 843(b) (West 2000). Finally, Count Three charged Allman with possession of a firearm during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 924(c)(1) (West 2000 &amp; Supp. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b307-15\">On October 4, 2006, Allman entered into a plea agreement with the Government. According to Allman\u2019s plea agreement, All-man agreed to plead guilty to Counts One and Three of the indictment. Allman\u2019s agreement also specified that \u201cthe amount of methamphetamine (mixture) that was known to or reasonably foreseeable by the defendant was at least 200 grams but less than 350 grams.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b307-16\">Allman appeared for sentencing on June 18, 2007. Prior to sentencing, the Government filed a motion pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cU.S.S.G.\u201d) \u00a7 5K1.1 and 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(e) (West 2000 &amp; Supp.2007) for a three level reduction in Allman\u2019s total offense level as a result of his substantial assistance. After reducing Allman\u2019s offense level three points pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 and a further three points pursuant to the Government\u2019s motion, the district court sentenced Allman to fifty-one months\u2019 imprisonment on Count One in conformity with his advisory guidelines range and to a consecutive term of sixty-months\u2019 imprisonment on Count Three.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>Allman timely noted his appeal and has filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On appeal, Allman questions: (1) whether his sentence was properly calculated and imposed; and (2) whether his prior counsel provided effective representation before the district court. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">To the extent Allman argues on appeal that his sentence was unreasonable, his argument is without merit.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Following <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), a district court must engage in a multi-step process at sentencing. First, it must calculate the appropriate advisory guidelines range. It must then consider the resulting range in conjunction with the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a) and determine an appropriate sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">Appellate review of a district court\u2019s imposition of a sentence is for abuse of discretion. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007); <em>see also United States v. Pauley, </em>511 F.3d 468, 473 (4th Cir.2007). The appellate court must first ensure that the district court committed no procedural error, such as \u201cfailing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guideline range.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>128 S.Ct. at 597.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-12\">If there are no procedural errors, the appellate court then considers the substantive reasonableness of the sentence. <em>Id. </em>\u201cSubstantive reasonableness review entails taking into account the totality of the circumstances, including the extent of any variance from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Pauley, </em>511 F.3d at 473 (quotations and citation omitted). While the court may presume a sentence within the guidelines range to be reasonable, it may not presume a sentence outside the range to be unreasonable. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, it must give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors justify imposing a variant sentence and to its determination regarding the extent of any variance. Even if the reviewing court would have reached a different sentence result on its own, this fact alone is insufficient to justify reversal of the district court. <em>Id. </em>at 474.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-13\">Here, the record does not indicate the district court committed procedural error in imposing Allman\u2019s sentence. According to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(6), the amount of methamphetamine reasonably foreseeable to Allman, as stipulated by the parties, results in a base offense level of 28. This level was then properly reduced three points pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1, resulting in an adjusted offense level of 25. The court further reduced Allman\u2019s total offense level three additional points pursuant to the Government\u2019s \u00a7 3553(e) and \u00a7 5K1.1 motion. This offense level combined with Allman\u2019s Criminal History Score of III resulted in an advisory guideline range of 51-63 months\u2019 imprisonment. By virtue of the Government\u2019s \u00a7 3553(e) motion, the district court was free to sen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>tence Allman below the statutory mandatory minimum sentence of five years. Therefore, Allman\u2019s sentence of 51 months was proper. Moreover, prior to imposing sentence, the district court gave Allman the opportunity to address the court, considered the advisory nature of the guidelines, and specifically stated it had considered the factors in \u00a7 3553(a). Accordingly, the district court did not commit procedural error in sentencing Allman.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">Additionally, Allman\u2019s sentence was substantively reasonable. Allman received a fifty-one month sentence when a mandatory minimum sentence of twenty years could have been imposed. The district court reduced Allman\u2019s offense level six points and then selected a sentence at the very bottom of Allman\u2019s advisory guidelines range. This court may presume a sentence within the advisory guidelines range is reasonable, and there is nothing in the record to rebut that presumption in Allman\u2019s case. <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2459, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Accordingly, Allman\u2019s sentence was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">Finally, Allman questions whether he received effective assistance of counsel in the district court. Ineffective assistance of counsel claims are not generally cognizable on direct appeal, unless it conclusively appears from the record that counsel did not provide effective representation. <em>See United States v. Richardson, </em>195 F.3d 192, 198 (4th Cir.1999); <em>United States v. Gastiaburo, </em>16 F.3d 582, 590 (4th Cir. 1994). Because the record does not conclusively demonstrate that Allman\u2019s counsel was ineffective, we decline to consider this claim on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">In accordance with <em>Anders, </em>we have reviewed the record in this case and have found no meritorious issues for appeal. We therefore affirm the judgment of the district court. This court requires that counsel inform Allman, in writing, of the right to petition the Supreme Court of the United States for further review. If All-man requests that a petition be filed, but counsel believes that such a petition would be frivolous, then counsel may move in this court for leave to withdraw from representation. Counsel\u2019s motion must state that a copy thereof was served on Allman.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-11\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-12\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b308-8\">. Allman was informed of his right to submit a pro se supplemental brief. He has elected not to do so.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b308-11\">. Additionally, to the extent Allman challenges the district court\u2019s three level downward departure pursuant to the Government\u2019s \u00a7 3553(e) motion, we lack jurisdiction to hear his appeal. See 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3742; <em>United States v. Hill, </em>70 F.3d 321, 324 (4th Cir.1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
