The parties are familiar with the facts, which we do not repeat, except those relevant to this disposition. This court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. We review the district court\u2019s decision upholding the Commissioner\u2019s denial of benefits de novo, <em>see Gillett-Netting v. Barnhart, </em>371 F.3d 593, 595 (9th Cir. 2004), and reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-7\">This court will affirm the Commissioner\u2019s decision if it is supported by substantial evidence. <em>Batson v. Commissioner of Soc. Sec. Admin., </em>359 F.3d 1190, 1193 (9th Cir.2004). \u201cSubstantial evidence is more than a mere scintilla, but less than a preponderance.\u201d <em>See Howard ex rel. Wolff v. Barnhart, </em>341 F.3d 1006, 1011 (9th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-8\">Pyle argues that the ALJ\u2019s decision to disregard the opinion of non-examining medical expert Dr. Sidney Bolter was not supported by substantial evidence. We agree. The ALJ does not point to substantial evidence in the record to support his decision to discount Dr. Bolter\u2019s opinion. Pyle is correct in her assertion that ALJs must consider the testimony of non-examining medical and psychological sources as opinion evidence. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 404.1527(f)(2). Dr. Bolter had \u201cserious questions\u201d about Pyle\u2019s ability to sustain concentration, and suggested \u201cat least moderate\u201d restrictions on Pyle\u2019s cognitive abilities. The ALJ recognized that Pyle had attempted, but failed, to maintain employment as an organist at weekly church meetings. The ALJ nonetheless stated that Pyle made no attempt to sustain work. The ALJ\u2019s decision does not provide substantial evidence to support his conclusion that Pyle can sustain work.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-11\">Pyle also argues that the ALJ improperly rejected the opinion of Pyle\u2019s treating physician, Dr. Adrian. Where an ALJ rejects the opinion of the treating physician in favor of a conflicting opinion, she must provide \u201cspecific reasons supported by substantial evidence in the record for doing so.\u201d <em>Lester v. Chater, </em>81 F.3d 821, 830 (9th Cir.1995); see <em>also Reddick v. Chater, </em>157 F.3d 715, 722 (9th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b692-12\">The ALJ did not provide specific reasons for rejecting Dr. Adrian\u2019s opinion. After discussing Pyle\u2019s entire treatment history, the ALJ rejected the treating doctor\u2019s opinion \u201cfor the above reasons.\u201d This explanation does little to identify the rationale for the ALJ\u2019s decision. At best, the ALJ points to a lack of \u201cmedical source statements\u201d in Dr. Adrian\u2019s report. The ALJ does not, however, explain why Dr. Adrian\u2019s statements are insufficient. Because the ALJ did not provide specific reasons for rejecting the treating physician\u2019s opinion, this court cannot make a determination regarding substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b692-13\">Accordingly, we REVERSE with instructions to the district court to REMAND this case to the Commissioner of Social Security for further proceedings consistent with this memorandum disposition.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b692-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
