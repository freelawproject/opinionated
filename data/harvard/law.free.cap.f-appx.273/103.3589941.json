MIRIAM GOLDMAN CEDARBAUM <footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>District Judge.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b129-22\">. The Honorable Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum, of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b129-13\">Summary Order</p>\n<p id=\"b129-14\">We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of this case. Defendant-Appellant Rodney Thomas (\u201cThomas\u201d) appeals from the judgment of conviction entered by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Stein, <em>J.) </em>after he pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute PCP.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-21\">Thomas challenges the district court\u2019s application of a four-level sentence enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3Bl.l(a), which applies to \u201can organizer or leader of a criminal activity that involved five or more participants or was otherwise extensive.\u201d When we examine a district court\u2019s imposition of a Section 3B1.1 enhancement, \u201cit is well established that we review its factual findings for clear error.\u201d <em>United States v. Huerta </em>371 F.3d 88, 91 (2d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>Cir.2004) (per curiam). As to the district court\u2019s application of the guidelines to the facts, \u201cwe are to give \u2018due deference\u2019 to the district court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e)). However, \u201ccases in this Circuit are not wholly consistent in expressing how much deference is \u2018due\u2019 the district court\u2019s determination when reviewing the imposition of an aggravating role adjustment. Some apply a clear error standard ... others review the adjustment <em>de novo.\u201d United States v. Burgos, </em>324 F.3d 88, 91 (2d Cir.2003) (citations omitted). We need not resolve this issue in this case because we would reach the same result under either standard.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">The district court correctly applied Section 3Bl.l(a) and supported the enhancement with sufficient findings. The record before the district court established that the PCP scheme involved more than five participants. Furthermore, the district court found specifically that Thomas \u201chad a number of people working for him as is set forth quite explicitly on the call reports, the transcripts of which I reviewed for this sentencing.... He says that quite specifically in the phone calls, and I find that he is an organizer or a leader.\u201d The court also explicitly adopted the findings of fact in the presentence report (\u201cPSR\u201d), which further demonstrate Thomas\u2019s role as a leader or organizer in the scheme. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Escotto, </em>121 F.3d 81, 85 (2d Cir.1997) (\u201cThe district court is entitled to rely on the factual findings in the PSR, provided, however, that the court explicitly adopts them.... \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b130-5\">Although we find no error in the district court\u2019s application of the aggravating role enhancement, we nevertheless remand this ease to the district court for resentencing pursuant to <em>United States v. Fagans, </em>406 F.3d 138 (2d Cir.2005). In that ease we found that remand for resentencing in conformity with <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), is appropriate where a district court, operating <em>pre-Booker, </em>correctly calculates a sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines but erroneously treats the guidelines as compulsory, and a defendant preserves his objection to that error. <em>Fagans, </em>406 F.3d at 142. The government concedes that \u201cThomas preserved his objection to the mandatory application of the Guidelines,\u201d and is thus entitled to a remand for resentencing consistent with the principles set forth in <em>Booker.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b130-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of conviction and REMAND this case to the district court with instructions to VACATE and RESENTENCE in conformity with <em>Booker.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
