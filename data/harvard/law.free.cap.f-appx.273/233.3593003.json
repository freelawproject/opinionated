Johnson was convicted in a bench trial for bank fraud, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1344 (2000) (two counts), use of false social security number, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 408(a)(7)(B) (2000) (five counts), and aggravated identity theft, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A(a)(l) (2000). He was sentenced to fifty-nine months of imprisonment. On appeal, he raises the following claims: (1) the district court erred in denying his motion for new counsel and a continuance; (2) he was convicted on multiplicitous counts; (3) insufficient evidence supports his convictions for use of false social security <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>number; (4) the district court abused its discretion in admitting certain hearsay evidence at trial and sentencing; and (5) the district court erred in imposing a two-level enhancement to his sentence for obstruction of justice. Finding no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">Johnson first argues on appeal that the trial court abused its discretion in denying his motion to substitute current counsel and in refusing to continue the case. The Sixth Amendment affords a criminal defendant the counsel of his choosing; however, that right is not absolute. <em>United States v. Mullen, </em>32 F.3d 891, 895 (4th Cir.1994); <em>Sampley v. Attorney Gen. of North Carolina, </em>786 F.2d 610, 613 (4th Cir.1986). This court\u2019s review is for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Gallop, </em>838 F.2d 105, 108 (4th Cir.1988). To determine whether the district court abused its discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s motion for a continuance so that he could substitute new counsel, this court considers: (1) the timeliness of the motion; (2) the adequacy of the district court\u2019s inquiry into the defendant\u2019s complaint about counsel; and (3) whether the defendant and counsel have experienced a \u201ctotal lack of communication preventing an adequate defense.\u201d <em>Mullen, </em>32 F.3d at 895 (citing <em>Gallop, </em>838 F.2d at 108). These factors must be weighed against the court\u2019s interest in the orderly administration of justice. <em>Mullen, </em>32 F.3d at 895. We find that, based on the court\u2019s thorough inquiry and due consideration of the factors at the hearing, there was no abuse of discretion in the denial of new counsel and a continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">Johnson next argues that certain convictions should be dismissed on grounds of multiplicity. An indictment charging a single offense in several counts is multiplicitous, subjecting a defendant to a risk of multiple sentences for a single offense in violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause. <em>See United States v. Goodine, </em>400 F.3d 202, 207 (4th Cir.2005). However, it is well established that a defendant may be convicted of two separate offenses arising from a single act if each charge requires proof of a fact not essential to the other. <em>See Blockburger v. United States, </em>284 U.S. 299, 52 S.Ct. 180, 76 L.Ed. 306 (1932). We find that the district court appropriately conducted the <em>Blockburger </em>analysis and concluded that this argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">Johnson also challenges the sufficiency of evidence supporting his convictions for falsely representing his social security number. A defendant challenging the sufficiency of the evidence faces a heavy burden. <em>United States v. Beidler, </em>110 F.3d 1064, 1067 (4th Cir.1997). \u201c[A]n appellate court\u2019s reversal of a conviction on grounds of insufficient evidence should be confined to cases where the prosecution\u2019s failure is clear.\u201d <em>United States v. Jones, </em>735 F.2d 785, 791 (4th Cir.1984). A verdict must be upheld on appeal if there is substantial evidence in the record to support it. <em>Glasser v. United States, </em>315 U.S. 60, 80, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86 L.Ed. 680 (1942). In determining whether the evidence in the record is substantial, this court views the evidence in the light most favorable to the Government, and inquires whether there is evidence that a reasonable finder of fact could accept as adequate and sufficient to establish a defendant\u2019s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>United States v. Burgos, </em>94 F.3d 849, 862 (4th Cir.1996) (en banc). We find sufficient evidence in the record to support the challenged convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">Johnson also asserts that the district court erred in admitting certain hearsay evidence at trial and sentencing. The district court has discretion generally to conduct a trial, including the presentation of evidence, in whatever manner the court deems appropriate, and the district court\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>evidentiary rulings are entitled to substantial deference and will not be reversed absent a clear abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Moore, </em>27 F.3d 969, 974 (4th Cir.1994). We find no abuse of discretion in the court\u2019s challenged rulings.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-5\">Johnson\u2019s last argument on appeal is that the district court erred in imposing a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice. When reviewing the district court\u2019s application of the Sentencing Guidelines, this court reviews findings of fact for clear error and questions of law de novo. <em>United States v. Green, </em>436 F.3d 449, 456 (4th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>547 U.S. 1156, 126 S.Ct. 2309,164 L.Ed.2d 828 (2006). Here, Johnson proffered altered documents in support of his defense. We find no error in the court\u2019s imposition of a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice. <em>See U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>\u00a7 3C1.1, comment, (n. 4(c)) (2006) (listing as an example the production of false, altered, or counterfeit documents and records during an official investigation or judicial proceeding).</p>\n<p id=\"b261-6\">Accordingly, we affirm Johnson\u2019s convictions and sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
