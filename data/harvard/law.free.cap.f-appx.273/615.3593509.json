The government argues that the district court committed a procedural error in failing properly to consider the advisory Guidelines range, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), and that the sentence was not reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b641-25\">As it was required to do, the district court correctly calculated the advisory Guidelines range. <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 259-60,125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The district court considered that range and also considered the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), including Noble\u2019s \u201chistory and characteristics.\u201d The district court then imposed a sentence below the Guidelines range, explaining the reasons for its downward departure. Accordingly, we conclude that the district court did not commit procedural error. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>- <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"ANn\">Finally, we have reviewed the record, including the sentencing transcript, and conclude that the district court\u2019s sentence was not substantively unreasonable in light of the facts and circumstances of this case. <em>Id. </em>(explaining that sentencing judges are \u201cin a superior position to find facts and judge their import under \u00a7 3553(a)\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"AUGF\">Accordingly, the sentence imposed by the district court is</p>\n<p id=\"ANk\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"***\">\n<p id=\"b641-26\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
