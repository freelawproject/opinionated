We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-19\">\u201cWe review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen removal proceedings for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Gao Ni v. Board of Immigration Appeals, </em>520 F.3d 125, 129 (2d Cir.2008) (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cThe BIA exceeds its allowable discretion if its decision (1) provides no rational explanation, (2) inexplicably departs from established policies, (3) is devoid of any reasoning, (4) contains only summary or conclusory statements, or (5) fails to consider the facts of record relevant to the motion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal brackets, ellipses, and quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b90-20\">On appeal, Paul contends that the BIA was incorrect to deny his motion as untimely in light of the fact that the BIA\u2019s decision on his previous petition was sent to the wrong location and, therefore, did not reach him \u201cuntil five months after the fact.\u201d Paul also challenges the removal order that was entered against him on July 25, 2000 by an Immigration Judge and summarily affirmed on January 11, 2001 by the BIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-21\">The BIA denied Paul\u2019s motion to reopen based on the fact that the motion (1) represented Paul\u2019s third such motion, <em>cf. 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(A) (providing that an alien in Paul\u2019s position \u201cmay file one motion to reopen proceedings under this section\u201d), and (2) had been submitted well past the 90 day limitations period set forth by the Immigration and Nationality Act, <em>see 8 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 1229a(c)(7)(C)(i). The BIA further concluded that Paul had not offered any reason why the BIA should exercise its discretion to reopen his removal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>proceedings <em>sua sponte. Cf. </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) (providing the BIA with discretion to \u201cat any time reopen or reconsider on its own motion any case in which it has rendered a decision\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">We lack jurisdiction to consider Paul\u2019s challenge to his removal order in light of the fact that our Court has already considered and rejected the same arguments that he raises in the instant proceeding. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d) (noting that \u201c[a] court may review a final order of removal only if ... another court has not decided the validity of the order, unless the reviewing court finds that the petition presents grounds that could not have been presented in the prior judicial proceeding\u201d); <em>Paul v. INS, </em>102 Fed. Appx. 195, 196 (2d Cir. 2004) (dismissing a petition for review in which Paul challenged the agency\u2019s ability to remove him \u201cas an alien convicted of an aggravated felony\u201d); Petitioner\u2019s Br. 3 (contending that Paul \u201cwas not deportable as an aggravated felon\u201d). We also lack jurisdiction to consider the BIA\u2019s determination that it would not exercise its discretion to reopen Paul\u2019s removal proceedings <em>sua sponte. See, e.g., Ali v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 518 (2d Cir.2006) (noting that \u201ca decision of the BIA whether to reopen a case <em>sua sponte </em>under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a) is entirely discretionary and therefore beyond our review\u201d). Regarding Paul\u2019s other claims, we note that review of the record reveals no error by the BIA \u2014 let alone any abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">Accordingly, because we have considered all of Paul\u2019s arguments and found them to be without merit, Paul\u2019s petition is DENIED insofar as Paul challenges the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reopen and DISMISSED insofar as Paul challenges his removability.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
