CABRANES, REENA RAGGI, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b82-14\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b82-15\">Defendants-appellants Gallipote Rivera and Christian Del Rosario were convicted, after a jury trial, of committing and aiding and abetting respectively the murders of Marcos Agramonte and Orquides Palmero, in furtherance of Del Rosario\u2019s drug enterprise. The Government alleged that Del Rosario hired Rivera as a hit man to kill Agramonte and Palmero who were two rival drug dealers. Defendants Rivera and Del Rosario appeal from judgments of conviction sentencing each principally to two concurrent terms of life imprisonment for Counts One and Two and a consecutive term of ten years\u2019 imprisonment for Count Three. In his appeal, Rivera contests the conviction on a number of grounds relating to the joint trial, including the Court\u2019s instruction to the jury regarding Del Rosario\u2019s indictment for aiding and abetting murder with respect to Rivera\u2019s indictment for committing murder; the admission of his proffer statements; and the denial of his request for a separate trial. Additionally, he alleges the erroneous admission of evidence of his involvement in drug dealing after allegedly committing the murders. In his appeal, Del Rosario contests his conviction on the following grounds: sufficiency of the evidence to prove the enter<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"57\">*57</page-number>prise motive under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1959(a); the Court\u2019s instruction to the jury that self-defense was not at issue in this case; and the Court\u2019s refusal to admit evidence of a prior inconsistent statement. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and the procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">Rivera\u2019s arguments are without merit. \u201cThere is a preference in the federal system for joint trials of defendants who are indicted together.\u201d <em>Zafiro v. United States, </em>506 U.S. 534, 537, 113 S.Ct. 933, 122 L.Ed.2d 317 (1993). Rivera was not only indicted together with Del Rosario, but his alleged crime was also closely connected to that of Del Rosario. \u201cThis preference [for joint trials] is particularly strong where ... the defendants are alleged to have participated in a common plan or scheme.\u201d <em>United States v. Salameh, </em>152 F.3d 88, 115 (2d Cir.1998). Rivera\u2019s argument that he suffered spillover prejudice from admission at the join trial of evidence concerning Del Rosario\u2019s drug dealing is without merit because that evidence would have been admissible against Rivera even if he had been tried alone to prove the existence of the enterprise in furtherance of which he murdered Agramonte and Palmero. <em>See, e.g., United States v. DiNome, </em>954 F.2d 839, 843 (2d Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">As for Rivera\u2019s contention that the Court\u2019s instructions to the jury improperly linked the question of his guilt to that of Del Rosario, we review jury instructions <em>de novo. Hudson v. New York City, </em>271 F.3d 62, 67 (2d Cir.2001). Rivera raised no objection to the aiding-and-abetting charge before the District Court; we therefore review this challenge only for plain error. Del Rosario was charged with aiding and abetting the murders of Agramonte and Palmero which, under the Government\u2019s theory at trial, were committed by Rivera. \u201c[T]he defendant [charged with aiding and abetting] must act with the specific intent of facilitating or advancing the principal\u2019s commission of the underlying crime.\u201d <em>United States v. Frampton, </em>382 F.3d 213, 223 (2d Cir.2004). It follows that, in order to find Del Rosario guilty of the alleged crime as charged, the jury must also find Rivera \u2014 -the alleged principal \u2014 guilty. Thus, the District Court\u2019s charge to this effect did not constitute error, much less plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">Rivera also contends evidence of his post-murder narcotics trafficking was improperly admitted for the purpose of establishing the enterprise and Rivera\u2019s position in it after the murders. We have noted in racketeering cases that the District Court has \u201cbroad discretion regarding the admissibility of evidence,\u201d including evidence that is \u201cprobative of the existence, organization, and nature of the RICO enterprise.\u201d <em>United States v. Wong, </em>40 F.3d 1347, 1378 (2d Cir.1994). We find no error in the admission of this evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-10\">Rivera also contests the admission of his proffer statements for the purpose of impeachment. A defendant\u2019s waiver in a proffer agreement \u201cwaives his exclusionary privilege under Federal Rule of Evidence 410 [and] permit[s] the Government to introduce defendant\u2019s proffer statements to rebut contrary evidence or arguments presented by the defense, whether or not defendant testifies.\u201d <em>United States v. Velez, </em>354 F.3d 190, 196 (2d Cir.2004). Here, Rivera planned to testify and provide evidence to contrary to that of the Government after having waived his exclusionary privilege in the earlier proffer agreements. We find no error or abuse of discretion by the District Court in the admission of Rivera\u2019s proffer statements. To the extent Rivera argues that his participation in the proffer session was the result of the ineffective assistance of counsel representing him in a separate case, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>this appeal is not the appropriate forum for us to decide the issue. <em>See United States v. Morris, </em>350 F.3d 32, 39 (2d Cir. 2003) (and cited cases).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">Del Rosario\u2019s arguments are similarly without merit. He argues that the Government failed to prove that he hired Rivera to murder Agramonte and Palmero in aid of racketeering pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1959(a)(1); he contends that the evidence tended to prove that his motive was the nonenterprise-related motive of self-defense. \u201c[A] defendant making an insufficiency claim bears a very heavy burden.\u201d <em>United States v. Desena, </em>287 F.3d 170, 177 (2d Cir.2002). Del Rosario\u2019s argument fails because it is not necessary for the Government to prove that defendant was motivated <em>primarily </em>\u201cfor the purpose of ... maintaining or increasing [his] position in an enterprise.\u201d 18 U.S.C \u00a7 1959(a); <em>see United States v. Concepcion, </em>983 F.2d 369, 381 (2d Cir.1992) (\u201c[W]e reject any suggestion that the \u2018for the purpose of element requires the government to prove that maintaining or increasing position in the RICO enterprise was the defendant\u2019s sole or principal motive.\u201d). The Government presented evidence that Del Rosario\u2019s motives for the murders were not only based on self-preservation, but also on preservation of the enterprise.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">Del Rosario\u2019s arguments that the District Court improperly instructed the jury that self-defense was not at issue in this case also fail. As he admits, Del Rosario never raised an affirmative defense of self-defense and did not argue that he acted in self-defense during the presentation of his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">Finally, Del Rosario argues that the District Court erred in excluding evidence that one of the Government\u2019s witnesses allegedly committed a murder he did not disclose to the Government. This alleged murder was not connected to the murders at issue in the trial and was clearly a collateral matter. \u201cA witness may be impeached by extrinsic proof of a prior inconsistent statement only as to matters which are not collateral, <em>ie., </em>as to those matters which are relevant to the issues in the case and could be independently proven.\u201d <em>United States v. Blackwood, </em>456 F.2d 526, 531 (2d Cir.1972). The evidence was properly excluded as collateral.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">Upon a review of the record and the relevant law, we detect no error in the District Court\u2019s judgments of December 21, 2005 (Rivera) and June 27, 2006 (Del Rosario). We have considered all of defendants\u2019 claims on appeal and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgments of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
