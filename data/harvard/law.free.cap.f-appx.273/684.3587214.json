We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-21\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b710-22\">Contrary to Lopez-Avalos\u2019s contention, it was not necessary for the government first to initiate rescission proceedings. As 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1256(a) indicates on its face, the government is <em>not </em>required to rescind an alien\u2019s status prior to commencement of procedures to remove him; and an order of removal issued by an IJ is sufficient to rescind the alien\u2019s status.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, the IJ did not lack jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b710-23\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b710-24\">The IJ did not err in finding that Lopez-Avalos was not lawfully admitted for permanent residence in 1990. Lopez-Avalos\u2019s declaration stated that he became a Legal Permanent Resident on May 18, 1990. His convictions occurred prior to that date, thereby rendering him ineligible for adjustment to lawful permanent residence status. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1255a(b)(1). As Lopez-Avalos was not eligible for lawful permanent residence status when his application was approved, he was never <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number>lawfully adjusted to that status. <em>See Monet v. INS, </em>791 F.2d 752, 753 (9th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b711-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b710-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir. R. 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b710-17\">. We lack jurisdiction over Lopez-Avalos's argument based on his status as a lawful temporaiy resident before adjustment to lawful permanent resident, as it was not raised to the BIA. It is, therefore, unexhausted. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
