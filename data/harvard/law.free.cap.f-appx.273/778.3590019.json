The vehicle, a Ford Explorer, was \u201cmoving slowly\u201d at the time, no more than 20 to 25 miles per hour.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Bailey suffered a head wound that caused her death two days later. There is no evidence that the door opened unexpectedly, that she was threatened or pushed, that she was under the influence of any drug or alcohol, or that she was depressed or suicidal. She simply opened the door and jumped out.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-19\">Peggy Tyler was the beneficiary of two accidental death and dismember<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"781\">*781</page-number>ment policies covering Bailey. The insurer, AG Life Insurance Company, refused to pay because, it contended, the deceased had not suffered an injury caused by an \u201caccident\u201d as required by the policies.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Tyler sued under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 <em>et seq. </em>The district court decided the case on cross motions for summary judgment, finding for the insurance company. Tyler appeals. We vacate the district court\u2019s order and remand.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">Because the term \u201caccident\u201d is not specifically defined by the policies, the district court appropriately resorted to Aabama law as supplying the rule of decision since the policies were delivered in Aabama, the loss occurred in Aabama, and because the court found no conflict between Aabama law and either ERISA or federal common law on this definitional legal issue. <em>See Buce v. Allianz Life Insurance Co., </em>247 F.3d 1133, 1148-49 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">Thus, the case came down to this: If Aabama law applies a purely subjective test to determine whether the fatal act of the insured was intentional or accidental, the claimant wins because the decedent\u2019s death was presumed by law to be accidental, <em>see Hearn v. Southern Life &amp; Health Insurance Co., </em>454 So.2d 932 (Ala.1984); <em>O\u2019Bar v. Southern Life &amp; Health Ins. Co., </em>232 Ala. 459, 168 So. 580 (1936); <em>Hanna v. Riggs, </em>333 So.2d 563 (Ala.1976), and the insurance company cannot prove that she intended to take her own life or that she had a basis for believing that serious injury or death would be a virtual certainty by jumping out of the vehicle under the circumstances presented. If, however, as the district court held, Aabama law includes both a subjective and an objective test for determining whether the consequences of a given act are \u201caccidental,\u201d then the result reached by the district court was correct because, objectively, serious injury or death would clearly be foreseeable to any reasonable person without protective headgear contemplating a leap onto a paved street from a moving vehicle going fast enough to cause the injuries Bailey suffered.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b807-11\">The debate about Alabama law centers on <em>Hearn v. Southern Life &amp; Health Insurance Co., </em>454 So.2d 932 (Ala.1984). The district court interpreted <em>Hearn </em>as adopting a rule that cases such as this one should be decided by applying a test having both subjective and objective components. Judgment for AG followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"782\">*782</page-number>After careful review, we conclude that the distinguished district judge misread <em>Hearn.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b808-4\">\n<em>I. The Hearn Decision</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"Aln\">Since 1986, the stable law of Alabama has included the following test for determining whether a death is accidental for purposes of insurance coverage:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b808-5\">To constitute an accidental death, it must have resulted from something unforeseen, unexpected, and unusual ... or \u2018which happens as by chance, or which does not take place according to the usual course of things,\u2019 or \u201cwithout foresight or expectations\u2019 or \u2018by reason of some violence, casualty, or vis major to the assured, without his design or consent or voluntary cooperation.\u2019</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b808-6\"><em>O\u2019Bar v. Southern Life &amp; Health Ins. Co., </em>232 Ala. 459, 168 So. 580, 582 (1936).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-7\">Between 1936 and 1984, the Alabama courts largely applied this test in cases where the insured assaulted another person, thereby triggering an altercation ending in the insured\u2019s death. It was not until the <em>Hearn </em>case arose in 1984 that the Alabama Supreme Court confronted a fact pattern not involving a third party where an insured voluntarily engaged in risky conduct but did not specifically intend his or her own death.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-8\">In <em>Hearn, </em>the insured was driving a pickup truck and became involved in a high speed chase by a police officer at speeds in excess of 70 and 80 miles per hour. Shortly after the police officer abandoned pursuit, the insured crashed into a gulley. He was pinned in his truck and died from smoke inhalation due to a fire that engulfed the vehicle. At the time of his death, his blood alcohol level was .11 percent. The insurer refused to pay death benefits under three policies on the basis that the death was not \u201caccidental\u201d as the policies required for coverage to attach. 454 So.2d at 932.</p>\n<p id=\"b808-11\">The <em>Hearn </em>Court began its analysis by citing one of its prior decisions involving an assault by an insured, explaining that the \u201c[f]oreseeability of death resulting from an insured\u2019s voluntary actions <em>must be tested from the subjective viewpoint of the insured himself.\u201d </em>454 So.2d at 934 (citing <em>Hanna v. Riggs, </em>333 So.2d 563 (Ala. 1976)) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Court then considered four decisions from other jurisdictions involving accidental death policies that were interpreted and applied in analogous factual situations. 454 So.2d at 935-36. In each of these cases, the deciding court concluded that although the insured\u2019s actions exposing himself to a risk of harm may have been voluntary and intentional, the insured did not expressly intend to die, so that death was by \u201caccidental means\u201d and covered by the policies. <em>See O\u2019Toole v. New York Life Ins. Co., </em>671 F.2d 913 (5th Cir.1982) (holding that while the insured \u201cintentionally injected himself with cocaine, he did not intend to cause nor did he anticipate that this injection would cause his death.\u201d); <em>Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Henkel, </em>234 F.2d 69 (4th Cir.1956) (affirming judgment of trial court that death of insured was caused by \u201cacci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"783\">*783</page-number>dental means\u201d where insured died in a car crash following a reckless high speed chase with police); <em>Rodgers v. Reserve Life Ins. Co., 8 </em>Ill.App.2d 542, 132 N.E.2d 692 (1956) (insured\u2019s death is accidental even where he voluntarily exposes himself to unnecessary danger); <em>Dooley v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., </em>104 N.J.Super. 429, 250 A.2d 168, 170 (1969) (driver\u2019s negligent failure to negotiate a curve in the road, which caused car accident resulting in his death was \u201can unexpected, unforeseen and unusual event constituting accidental means....\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">The Alabama Supreme Court then held in <em>Hearn </em>that the evidence supported an inference of fact that the insured\u2019s death was an accident, and it therefore reversed the trial court\u2019s directed verdict in favor of the insurance company. The Coui\u2019t specifically noted that a jury could easily have rejected the theory that the insured intended to die from smoke inhalation while pinned in his truck. At no time did the <em>Hearn </em>Court analyze the evidence in terms of a \u201creasonable man\u201d or any other objective standard; rather, its focus remained on the specific intent of the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">\n<em>II. The District Court\u2019s Analysis</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">The district court read <em>Hearn </em>to establish a test that includes both an objective and subjective component in determining whether a given death is accidental or intentional. The district court focused on a lone sentence in the New Jersey <em>Dooley </em>decision cited in <em>Hearn, </em>stating that \u201crecovery is only precluded where there is a reasonable basis for his belief that his conduct makes serious injury or death a virtual certainty.\u201d <em>Hearn, </em>454 So.2d at 935 (quoting <em>Dooley, </em>250 A.2d at 170).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-8\">That statement, however, and statements like it in the other relevant decisions, uniformly relate to the question of whether the factual circumstances under review would make serious injury or death a virtual certainty <em>to the decedent. </em>In none of the Alabama cases, including <em>Hearn, </em>does the court actually apply an objective test or analysis\u2014a reasonable person inquiry\u2014in addition to the determination of what the decedent personally intended\u2014a purely subjective test albeit aided by an objective review of the facts. We conclude, therefore, unlike the district court, that Alabama law requires application of a subjective test in this case; and the question is whether the decedent had a reasonable basis to believe that her conduct made serious injury or death a virtual certainty. An objective test inquiring as to the foreseeability of serious injury or death to a reasonable person in the same circumstances is not appropriate. And, in this case, given the slow speed of the moving vehicle at the time, it cannot be said that serious injury or death was a virtual certainty to the decedent. She could reasonably have concluded that some injury was likely but that serious injury or death was not.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-10\">Other decisions from both Alabama and this Circuit support this conclusion about Alabama law. In <em>Hairston v. Liberty National Life Ins. Co., </em>584 So.2d 807 (Ala. 1991), the insured died as a result of acute ethanol poisoning after a night of heavy drinking. The insurer denied coverage, contending that the death was not by \u201caccidental means.\u201d Citing <em>Hearn, </em>the <em>Hairston </em>court concluded that the trial court erred in holding that, as matter of law, the death was not an \u201caccident.\u201d The court specifically noted that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b809-11\">A jury could find that the death, while a result of the insured\u2019s voluntary actions, was something unforeseen, unexpected and unusual, or that, as was the case in <em>Hearn, supra, </em>the insured died as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"784\">*784</page-number>result of a miscalculation of his capabilities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b810-4\">584 So.2d at 809.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b810-5\">Accordingly, we find that Alabama determines whether a death is \u201caccidental\u201d for insurance purposes based solely on the subjective intent of the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">\n<em>III. Alabama Law and ERISA</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">In a footnote, the district court held that if Alabama courts apply a purely subjective test to determine whether a death is accidental, Alabama law would be inconsistent with the principles of ERISA and federal common law\u2014which the district court interpreted to apply both an objective and subjective component\u2014and therefore inapplicable. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-8\">It is undisputed that federal common law applies both an objective and subjective test to determine the meaning of the term \u201caccident\u201d for purposes of insurance coverage. <em>Buce, </em>247 F.3d at 1146-47 (citing <em>Wickman v. NW. Nat\u2019l Ins. Co., </em>908 F.2d 1077 (1st Cir.1990)). However, this is not the end of the analysis because, in this case, a choice of law provision exists in both insurance policies. And, as this Court previously held, \u201c[t]he pertinent question is whether the principles of liability agreed upon by the parties are inconsistent with the language of ERISA or the policies that inform the statute and animate the common law of the statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1148.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-11\">In <em>Buce, </em>this Court was faced with a very similar conundrum: whether to follow the federal common law and apply both an objective and subjective analysis to determine whether an insured\u2019s death was accidental, or follow the choice of law provision contained in the insurance policy and apply Georgia law which utilized a much-criticized \u201caccidental means\u201d analysis. 247 F.3d at 1146-48.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The <em>Buce </em>Court determined that the parties\u2019 agreement to apply Georgia law-even though it did not coincide with federal common law\u2014governed in the absence of any evidence that Georgia\u2019s \u201caccidental means\u201d test was unreasonable or fundamentally unfair. <em>Id. </em>at 1148-49.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-12\">As in <em>Buce, </em>AIG has not pointed to any language in ERISA\u2019s statutory scheme, nor to any cases formulating the common law of ERISA, suggesting that the agreement of the parties to apply Alabama law to these insurance policies would be subversive of ERISA. To the contrary, applying Alabama\u2019s purely subjective test to these insurance policies would operate to provide more coverage and protection to beneficiaries, an express purpose of ERISA. <em>Horton v. Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co., </em>141 F.3d 1038, 1041 (11th Cir.1998) (noting that one of the primary goals of ERISA is the protection of the interests of employees and their beneficiaries in employee benefit plans); <em>accord </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001. As stated in <em>Buce, </em>\u201c[w]here a choice of law is made by an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"785\">*785</page-number>ERISA contract, it should be followed, if not unreasonable or fundamentally unfair.\u201d <em>Buce, </em>247 F.3d at 1149 (quoting <em>Wang Laboratories, Inc. v. Kagan, </em>990 F.2d 1126, 1128-29 (9th Cir.1993)). It would be eminently reasonable to apply Alabama law to interpret two insurance policies issued in Alabama, involving an Alabama employee, an Alabama beneficiary, and a loss that occurred in Alabama. We therefore find that the Alabama choice of law provision in the insurance policies at issue is not unreasonable or fundamentally unfair and does not conflict with ERISA. Accordingly, it is appropriate to apply Alabama\u2019s purely subjective test to interpret the policies.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b811-5\">\n<em>IV. Intentional Self-Inflicted Injury Exclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b811-6\">As an alternative rationale for denying coverage, the district court determined that Bailey\u2019s death fell within the policies\u2019 exclusion for \u201cintentionally self-inflicted injuries.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In particular, the district court held that \u201cthe choice of jumping from a moving vehicle necessarily results in injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b811-9\">Like the term \u201caccident,\u201d the term \u201cintentionally self-inflicted injury\u201d is nowhere defined in either policy. However, there is no dispute from a subjective standpoint that Bailey did not intend to harm or kill herself when she jumped out of the moving vehicle. Accordingly, for the same reasons that we find Bailey\u2019s death to have been an \u201caccident,\u201d we find that the \u201cintentionally self-inflicted injury\u201d exclusions do not apply. This is the same result reached in <em>Hearn </em>on the same issue. <em>See </em>454 So.2d at 933.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-10\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b811-11\">The order of the district court granting summary judgment in favor of AIG and denying summary judgment in favor of Tyler is VACATED. The case is REMANDED to the district court for the entry of summary judgment in favor of Tyler and to conduct any further proceedings necessary and appropriate in accordance with this opinion.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b806-11\">. There is a factual dispute about the exact speed of the car, but the parties agree that it was moving no faster than 20 to 25 miles per hour. The district court found that this issue did not matter; it was enough that the vehicle was moving fast enough to cause the injuries sustained.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b807-7\"><em>. </em>Neither of the insurance policies contain a definition of the term \"accident.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b807-8\">. Because the case is governed by ERISA, and because the parties agree that AIG did not have discretion to determine eligibility for benefits or to construe the terms of the plan, the district court properly held that it should review <em>de novo </em>the denial of benefits. <em>Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co. v. Bruch, </em>489 U.S. 101, 109, 109 S.Ct. 948, 103 L.Ed.2d 80 (1989); <em>Williams v. BellSouth Telecomms., Inc., </em>373 F.3d 1132, 1137 (11th Cir.2004); <em>Shaw v. Conn. Gen. Life Ins. Co., </em>353 F.3d 1276, 1282 (11th Cir.2003); <em>HCA Health Servs. of Georgia, Inc. v. Employers Health Ins. Co., </em>240 F.3d 982, 993 (11th Cir.2001). Similarly the district court judgment is subject to de novo review here on appeal. <em>Doyle v. Liberty Life Assur. Co. of Boston, </em>511 F.3d 1336, 1341 (11th Cir.2008); <em>Williams, </em>373 F.3d at 1134.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b807-13\">. In addition to her fatal head wound, an autopsy revealed widely scattered bruises and a scrape on her left flank. As will be seen, <em>infra, </em>the subjective test requires evidence that the decedent believed serious injury or death to be a \"virtual certainty\u201d in order to establish the requisite intent and rule out an accident. An objective test would merely require foreseeability to a reasonable person that serious injury or death would likely occur, a standard that would be met here as the district court concluded.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b808-9\">. The <em>Hearn </em>Court also noted with approval language in <em>Aetna Life Ins. Co. v. Beasley, </em>272 Ala. 153, 130 So.2d 178 (1961), another insured assault case, which \"reasoned that a death may be caused by accidental means, even where that means is voluntarily rendered, if, in the precipitating act, something unforeseen, unusual, or unexpected occurs to produce the resultant injury.\u201d 454 So.2d at 934. <em>Hearn </em>also quoted <em>Provident Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co. v. Hanna, </em>294 Ala. 37, 311 So.2d 294 (1975), which stated, in pertinent part: \"[a]n accident is an occurrence that is not to be expected or anticipated in light of common experience and of existing circumstances, and such determination is made from the standpoint of the insured.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b810-9\">. This Court has also had the opportunity to consider the definition of \"accident\u201d in Alabama for insurance purposes. In discussing whether an insured's death following surgery constituted an \"accident\u201d for purposes of coverage under an accidental death insurance policy, a panel of this Court cited <em>Hairston </em>and <em>Hearn </em>for the proposition that \u201crecovery is precluded only where \u2018there is a reasonable basis for [the insured\u2019s] belief that his conduct makes serious injury or death a virtual certainty.' \u201d <em>Tate v. Government Employees Ins. Co., </em>997 F.2d 1433, 1437 (11th Cir.1993). There was no mention of any objective or \"reasonable man\u201d standard.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b810-14\">. Georgia law distinguishes between the terms \"accidental injury\u201d and \"injuries resulting from accidental means.\u201d Under the \u201caccidental means\u201d analysis, \"[t]he focus is on the occurrence or happening which produces the result, not the result itself.\u201d 247 F.3d at 1139.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b811-7\">. AIG argues that <em>Buce </em>directly conflicts with <em>Seamon v. Vaughan, </em>921 F.2d 1217 (11th Cir. 1991), which AIG reads as a bright-line rule that ERISA preempts all choice of law provisions. Pursuant to the \"prior panel rule,\u201d AIG therefore argues that <em>Buce </em>should not apply to this case. <em>See Cohen v. Office Depot, Inc., </em>204 F.3d 1069, 1072 (11th Cir.2000) (\"Where prior panel decisions conflict, we are bound to follow the oldest one.\u201d). Simply put, AIG is wrong. In <em>Seamon, </em>the choice of law provision directly contradicted ERISA\u2019s statutory allowance of attorneys' fees to a prevailing plaintiff, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(g). In this case, no such conflicting statutory provision exists. In no way can <em>Seamon </em>be read so broadly to mean that all choice of law provisions in ERISA insurance contracts are to be automatically preempted; rather, only choice of law provisions which directly conflict with the ERISA statute itself are subject to preemption. <em>Seamon, </em>921 F.2d at 1219. Accordingly, there is no conflict and the \"prior panel rule\u201d does not apply.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b811-14\">. The exclusion is similar in both policies.
