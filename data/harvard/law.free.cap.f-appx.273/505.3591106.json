Nettles. The IJ ordered him to be removed to Serbia and Montenegro. Djokovic appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals (\u201cBIA\u201d), which adopted and affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision. Djokovic now petitions this court for review, arguing that: (1) he was denied due process when he was given only an uncorrected, unsigned version of the IJ\u2019s decision prior to the BIA proceedings instead of the corrected copy that was included in the BIA\u2019s administrative record when Djokovic petitioned this court for review; and (2) the underlying decisions of the IJ and BIA were erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">We hold that though it was extremely poor practice not to provide the parties with the corrected version of the IJ\u2019s decision when it was corrected, Djokovic\u2019s right to due process was not violated because the discrepancies between the versions were neither significant nor central to the BIA\u2019s affirmance of the IJ\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">We also affirm the BIA\u2019s denial of Djokovic\u2019s claims for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d). Though we do not endorse the IJ\u2019s findings regarding Djokovic\u2019s credibility and whether his experiences amounted to past persecution, we affirm the IJ and BIA on the grounds of changed country conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\">Djokovic is an ethnic Albanian who was born on January 2, 1985, in Tuzi, Montenegro. He first entered the United States on September 9, 1999, at the age of fourteen. On March 8, 2000, Djokovic submitted his first Application for Asylum and Withholding of Removal (\u201cinitial application\u201d) under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cthe Act\u201d), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101. At the time, Djokovic was not fluent in English and relied on an interpreter provided by a community organization \u2014 the Albanian Assistance Center in Bronx, New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-11\">After various procedural hearings, including a change of venue from New York to Detroit, and the passage of several years, an IJ conducted a hearing on August 30, 2005, to investigate the merits of Djokovic\u2019s asylum application. Djokovic was represented by counsel and the proceedings were conducted in English, Djokovic having learned the language in the six years since his arrival in America. Pri- or to the hearing, Djokovic had submitted a supplemental or updated application for asylum and withholding under both the Asylum Act and the CAT. In addition to the initial and supplemental applications, Djokovic also entered several documents into evidence, including a certificate from the Kosova<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Liberation Army (\u201cKLA\u201d) stating that Djokovic\u2019s father had been actively involved in \u201csupport to Kosova Refugees.\u201d Several articles and reports on the background of Yugoslavia, Serbia, and Montenegro were also admitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-12\">Because we narrowly affirm the IJ and BIA decisions on the grounds of changed country conditions, we describe the crux of Djokovic\u2019s claim only in brief. Djokovic claims that he and his family have been persecuted for their political and social activities, specifically for assisting ethnic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>Albanians in Montenegro and providing safe passage to Albania for refugees from Kosova. Djokovie also suggested that his father was involved in supplying arms to the KLA, but he was not certain of that.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">The event that precipitated Djokovic\u2019s flight from Montenegro occurred on the evening of June 6, 1999. According to Djokovie, he was at his uncle\u2019s house watching a soccer match. Djokovic\u2019s father had been away from their home for an unspecified amount of time, helping families from Kosova get into Albania. Djokovie claims that late in the evening, a group of armed men wearing military clothing broke down the door of the uncle\u2019s house and arrested and beat both Djokovie and his uncle. They demanded to know the whereabouts of Djokovic\u2019s father, and when neither Djokovie or his uncle provided any information, the two were taken to a military prison. During the ride, the armed men alternately taunted and beat Djokovie and his uncle, mocking the situation of ethnic Albanians. At the military prison, Djokovie and his uncle were separated and placed in small, windowless, lightless cells. Djokovie was left alone for several hours. Eventually three men came into the cell, interrogated him, and beat him with their hands, feet, and police batons. Djokovie was left alone again for several hours before being released. Though he was not beaten again, the guards insinuated that something worse would happen if Djokovic\u2019s father did not turn himself in. After the June 6, 1999 incident, Djokovie did not leave the house, not even to attend school. Four to six weeks later, Djokovic\u2019s family decided to smuggle him out of the country because they feared for his safety. He was smuggled into Albania where he stayed for a few months awaiting an opportunity to come to the United States. A family Mend found a youth soccer team that was traveling to Canada and was willing to pass Djokovie off as one of their players. In Canada, Djokovie met a separate set of smugglers who got him into the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Djokovie testified to these facts at the hearing. While he demonstrated fluency in English, it is also clear that he did not have a full mastery of the language and that he misunderstood tlie judge and DHS attorney at times and the judge and attorney also seemed to have misunderstood him. At the conclusion of the hearing, the IJ recessed for deliberations, though the record does not indicate the length of the recess. Upon reconvening, the IJ rendered an oral decision denying Djokovic\u2019s application and ordering him removed to Serbia-Montenegro. The IJ found that Djokovie was not credible and, in the alternative, that even if Djokovie were credible, the events that he described did not rise to the level of persecution. The IJ further found that even if such treatment were persecution, the country conditions have changed in Serbia-Montenegro, rebutting Djokovic\u2019s presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution. Finally, the IJ found that Djokovic\u2019s past treatment did not rise to the level of severity that would justify granting asylum on humanitarian grounds. As a corollary, because Djokovie could not meet the burden for a grant of asylum, he also failed to meet the higher burden necessary for a grant of withholding.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">As for Djokovic\u2019s claim for protection under the CAT, though the IJ made an independent assessment of Djokovic\u2019s credibility on this issue, she ultimately relied on many of the same inconsistencies discussed below in the context of Djokovic\u2019s asylum claim. The IJ further found that even if Djokovie had been credible, the conduct complained of did not rise to the level of torture as defined in the CAT. Other than Djokovic\u2019s allegation of past <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>torture, he presented no other substantial evidence to prove that he faced the possibility of torture should he be removed. Accordingly, the IJ denied Djokovic\u2019s application for withholding under the CAT and ordered him removed to Serbia-Montenegro.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">The IJ initially rendered an oral decision. The uncorrected and unsigned transcription was included in the administrative record at pages 85-117. Later, though it is not clear when, the IJ made handwritten changes to the decision and signed it. This version was incorporated into the administrative record at pages 50-82.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Djokovic appealed the decision. The BIA affirmed the IJ\u2019s decision on March 29, 2007 in a one-paragraph opinion that summarily adopted the findings and reasoning of the IJ. <em>In re Djokovic, </em>No. A78 205 845 (B.I.A. March 29, 2007). The BIA did not state which version of the IJ\u2019s decision it reviewed. Following the BIA\u2019s decision, Djokovic appealed to this court. It was only upon receiving the record for this appeal that Djokovic discovered the two versions of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">\u201cTo prevail on a due process challenge to deportation proceedings, [an alien] must show error and substantial prejudice. A showing of prejudice is essentially a demonstration that the alleged violation affected the outcome of the proceedings; we will not simply presume prejudice.\u201d <em>Gishta v. Gonzales, </em>404 F.3d 972, 979 (6th Cir.2005) (quotation omitted). \u201cThe alien carries the burden of establishing that [he was] prejudiced ... or denied ... fundamental fairness in order to prove that he has suffered a denial of due process.\u201d <em>Allabani v. Gonzales, </em>402 F.3d 668, 676 (6th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">Djokovic concedes that \u201csome of the changes are undoubtably grammatical or minor in nature,\u201d but argues that there are also, \u201cmany significant changes.\u201d Pet\u2019r Br. at 15. Djokovic explicitly mentions four differences that he considers significant. The first difference involved the omission of the word \u201cnot\u201d in the definition of torture, which reversed the meaning of the sentence. <em>Compare </em>J.A. 66 <em>with </em>J.A. 31. Nevertheless, it was obvious that \u201cnot\u201d was omitted accidentally, and the intended meaning of the sentencing was clear given the context and the supporting citation. The second difference involved the substitution of the word \u201cadmissions\u201d for \u201comissions\u201d in a sentence explaining what facts can support an adverse credibility finding. <em>Compare </em>J.A. 31-32 <em>with </em>J.A. 68-69. While \u201cadmit\u201d and \u201comit\u201d obviously have different meanings, the substitution made little difference in practice given the surrounding context and given the accompanying citation, which referenced the language contained in the corrected copy.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-10\">The third and fourth differences are more troubling and illustrate the dangers in an oral opinion that is forwarded for review without an examination for errors in transcription: Both of these discrepancies arose because the IJ initially misquoted Djokovic\u2019s testimony and later corrected those quotes. In the first instance, the IJ misquoted Djokovic\u2019s testimony concerning the dates of his father\u2019s arrests. <em>Compare </em>J.A. 43 <em>with </em>J.A. 78. In the second instance, the IJ misquoted Djokovic\u2019s testimony in response to the question of whether he or his family had been involved in political organizations. <em>Compare </em>J.A. 36 <em>with </em>J.A. 71.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-11\">If the IJ had actually relied on the inaccurate quotations in making her adverse credibility findings, this court would be very troubled. However, that does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>seem to be the case. The IJ\u2019s discussion of the alleged inconsistency as to the dates of the father\u2019s arrest took up the three pages of the transcribed opinion and the IJ accurately quoted Djokovic\u2019s testimony twice in those pages, whereas she misquoted it only once. The IJ\u2019s discussion of the alleged inconsistency as to participation in political groups took up two pages. Despite the misquotation, one could easily glean the factual basis of and reasoning behind the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding on that matter. Of course, whether or not the IJ was actually correct in identifying inconsistencies and whether her reasoning was sound is a separate issue \u2014 but not one that matters for Djokovic\u2019s due process claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">We recognize that \u201c[i]n general, it is a bad practice for a judge to continue working on his opinion after the case has entered the appellate process, except in emergency situations requiring the issuance of the judgment in advance of the preparation of the opinion. The practice presents the losing party with a moving target.\u201d <em>Mamedov v. Ashcroft, </em>387 F.3d 918, 920 (7th Cir.2004). However, Djokovic has failed to explain how he was <em>prejudiced </em>by not having the corrected judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">On one hand, if the BIA relied on the uncorrected decision, which admittedly contained errors, Djokovic was not prejudiced because he had the opportunity to point out any mistakes to the BIA. On the other hand, if the BIA relied on the corrected version of the judgment, it is also hard to see how Djokovic was unfairly prejudiced by not receiving a copy. After all, Djokovic\u2019s brief to the BIA questioned only the underlying reasoning of the IJ and did not refer to any of the particular mistakes it now identifies in the uncorrected copy of the judgment. Obviously, if the changes to the judgment had been substantive \u2014 for example if the IJ added alternative grounds for her adverse credibility finding \u2014 then Djokovic would have cause for complaint. But that is not the case here. The corrected copy contained cosmetic changes fixing errors that Djokovic apparently did not deem significant enough to mention in his brief to the BIA. Though this court deplores an administrative process that failed to provide the parties with corrected copies of the IJ\u2019s decision, it is clear that the outcome of the case (the BIA\u2019s affirmance of the I J) would have been no different. Thus, Djokovic\u2019s due process claim is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">Where the BIA adopts an IJ\u2019s decision, we review the underlying decision as well as any additional reasons stated by the BIA. <em>Gilaj v. Gonzales, </em>408 F.3d 275, 282-83 (6th Cir.2005). We review the legal conclusions of the IJ and BIA de novo. <em>Ali v. Ashcroft, </em>366 F.3d 407, 409 (6th Cir.2004). Findings of fact, including determinations of credibility, however, are deemed \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d INA \u00a7 242(b)(4)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">A. Refugee Asylum and Withholding of Removal</p>\n<p id=\"b536-10\">1. Eligibility</p>\n<p id=\"b536-11\">In order to be eligible for asylum, the applicant must demonstrate that: (1) he is a refugee as defined in 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A); and (2) he \u201cmerits a favorable exercise of discretion by the Attorney General.\u201d <em>Perkovic v. INS, </em>33 F.3d 615, 620 (6th Cir.1994). The applicant bears the burden of proof of demonstrating either past persecution or well-founded fear of future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a)-(b) (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>An applicant\u2019s testimony, if credible, can be, by itself, \u201csufficient to sustain the burden of proof without corroboration.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a) (1997). An applicant who establishes past persecution is presumed to have a well-founded fear of persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(b)(l)(i) (1997). The presumption may be rebutted by establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that since the persecution occurred, conditions in the applicant\u2019s country have changed to such an extent that the applicant no longer has a well-founded fear of being persecuted if he were to return. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">2. Credibility and Past Persecution</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">Because we affirm the IJ\u2019s decision on the narrow grounds of changed country conditions, we need not formally review her adverse credibility finding or her finding that the alleged events did not arise to the level of persecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">3. Changed country conditions</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">Whether country conditions have changed sufficiently to rebut the presumption of a well-founded fear is a finding of fact, which we review under the deferential abuse-of-discretion and substantial-evidence standards. An IJ\u2019s finding of changed country conditions is deemed \u201cconclusive unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\u201d INA \u00a7 242(b)(4)(B), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">As evidence of changed country conditions, DHS submitted the 1999, 2003, and 2004 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices in Serbia and Montenegro. Eight pages of the 1999 report detailed the conditions in Montenegro. There were some reports of abuses committed by the federal VJ (Yugoslavian Army) troops stationed in Montenegro, including abductions and detentions of Kosovar refugees and extrajudicial killings. U.S. Dep\u2019t of State, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for Serbia-Montenegro \u2014 1999, 35-36 (Feb. 23, 2000) [hereinafter 1999 Report]. The 2003 and 2004 reports, however, demonstrated significant improvements in the conditions. U.S. Dep\u2019t of State, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for Serbia-Montenegro \u2014 2003 (Feb. 25, 2004) [hereinafter 2003 Report]; U.S. Dep\u2019t of State, Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for Serbia-Montenegro \u2014 2004 (Feb. 28, 2005) [hereinafter 2004 Report], For example there were no reports of politically motivated killings or disappearances in 2003 or 2004. 2003 Report, 41 and 2004 Report, 34. The 2003 and 2004 reports also noted that while there were still reports of police occasionally beating suspects during arrest or detention, there were fewer reports than in previous years. 2003 Report at 41 and 2004 Report at 34. The sections on \u201cNational/Racial/Ethnic Minorities\u201d did not even mention the Albanian minority, but rather focused the problems encountered by Romanis and Bosniaks.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 2003 Report at 48 and 2004 Report at 40-41.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-12\">The IJ noted the changed country conditions, citing the lack of politically motivated killings, disappearances, or detentions. J.A. 82. The IJ also noted that many of the events that happened to Djokovic and his family occurred under Slobodan Milosevic\u2019s regime and that Milosevic was no longer in power. Though the IJ based her finding primarily on the country reports, this does not mean her decision was not supported by substantial evidence. <em>Sha</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number><em>sha v. Gonzales, </em>227 Fed.Appx. 436, 440 (6th Cir.2007) (\u201cThis Court has consistently held that substantial evidence supports the conclusion that country reports detailing the regime change in Iraq rebut any presumption of a well-founded fear of persecution based on past persecution on account of Christianity.\u201d); <em>see also Gojani v. Mukasey, </em>266 Fed.Appx. 420, 423 (6th Cir. 2008) (upholding a finding of changed country conditions even though the IJ \u201crelied principally on the State Department\u2019s Country Reports regarding the human rights situation in Kosovo.\u201d). The IJ\u2019s findings also comported with past precedent. <em>See, e.g., Micakovic v. Ashcroft, </em>85 Fed.Appx. 424, 425-426 (6th Cir.2003) (\u201cThe IJ noted that, according to the State Department Country Report, ethnic Albanians were treated well in Montenegro, and concluded that [the applicant] should not fear returning there.\u201d); <em>Gjokic v. Ashcroft, </em>104 Fed.Appx. 501, 506 (6th Cir.2004) (\u201cAccording to the State Department, ethnic Albanians are treated relatively well in Montenegro, and the evidence thus does not compel an immigration judge to conclude that petitioners have a well-founded fear of returning there.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">Djokovic responded by citing several articles discussing the conditions in Serbia and Montenegro. But these articles did not adequately distinguish conditions in Serbia and conditions in Montenegro, the former being much worse for ethnic Albanians. Furthermore, much of the criticism contained in the reports was directed at the lack of investigation into <em>past </em>abuses, as opposed to new allegations of recent abuses. The Amnesty International Report acknowledged the same: \u201cThere appeared to be a drop in the number of alleged instances of torture or ill-treatment by the police in 2004. Amnesty International is concerned, however, that allegations continued and investigations into previous allegations of police torture and ill-treatment remained seriously flawed.\u201d Amnesty International, \u201cSerbia and Montenegro: A Wasted Year. The Continuing Failure to Fulfill Key Human Rights Commitments Made to the Council of Europe,\u201d (March 22, 2005), available at http://www. amnesty.org/en/library. Furthermore, Djokovic did not submit any individualized evidence that would tend to show that he would remain a target for persecution despite these changed country conditions. The immigration judge\u2019s finding that Djokovic did not have a well-founded fear of persecution based on the changed country conditions in Montenegro was thus supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">4. Withholding of Removal</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">In order to qualify for withholding of removal, Djokovic \u201cmust establish that there is a clear probability that he will be subject to persecution if forced to return to the country of removal.\u201d <em>Pilica v. Ashcroft, </em>388 F.3d 941, 951 (6th Cir.2004). This is a higher burden of proof than what is required for a claim of asylum. Because Djokovic could not establish his eligibility for asylum, it follows he could not \u201csatisfy the more onerous burden for withholding of removal either.\u201d <em>Cutaj v. Gonzales, </em>206 Fed.Appx. 485, 492 (6th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">B. Asylum on humanitarian grounds</p>\n<p id=\"b538-9\">Djokovic also applied for a humanitarian grant of asylum under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(1)(iii). That provision applies to those applicants who have suffered past persecution, but whose presumption of a well-founded fear of persecution has been rebutted. In order to qualify, the applicant must either demonstrate \u201ccompelling reasons for being unwilling or unable to return to the country arising out of the severity of the past persecution\u201d or \u201cestablish that there is a reasonable possibility that he or she may suffer other serious <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>harm upon removal to that country.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(h&gt;)(1)(iii)(A) and (B).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">The IJ found that Djokovic was not eligible for a grant of asylum under this portion of the regulations because Djokovic suffered only \u201cone detention of a brief confinement and an alleged beating that occurred during that brief confinement.\u201d The IJ also relied on <em>In re N-M-A, </em>22 I. <em>&amp; </em>N. Dec. 312 (BIA 1998), a case in which the BIA denied asylum to an applicant who was detained for a month, during which he was beaten periodically, deprived of food for three days, and ultimately hospitalized. The IJ emphasized that \u201cthe incidents [in Djokovic\u2019s case] nowhere rise to the level of the incidents that were se forth in <em>Matter of N-M-A.\u201d In re Djokovic, </em>File A 78 205 845, slip op. at 30 (U.S. Immigration Court, Aug. 30, 2005)(uneorrected decision).</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">Even taking into account Djokovic\u2019s young age, we cannot hold that the IJ abused her discretion in denying Djokovic\u2019s request for asylum on humanitarian grounds. Those seeking humanitarian asylum must have suffered past persecution that is \u201cparticularly severe.\u201d <em>Cutaj, </em>206 Fed.Appx. at 491 (citing <em>Pergega-Gjonaj v. Gonzales, </em>128 Fed.Appx. 507, 512 (6th Cir.2005)). We have, in numerous cases, rejected applications for asylum on humanitarian grounds when the maltreatment complained of is far more severe than that suffered by Djokovic. <em>See, e.g., Pergega-Gjonaj </em>(four months of hard labor and starvation and atrocities commits ted against extended family members); <em>Potka v. Ashcroft, </em>65 Fed.Appx. 50, 51 (6th Cir.2003) (applicant was forced to watch murdered mother\u2019s body being dragged through the streets). Assuming Djokovic\u2019s account of events to be true, the IJ did not abuse her discretion in holding that his experiences did not constitute particularly severe persecution and that Djokovic was accordingly ineligible for a humanitarian grant of asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-10\">C. Protection under the CAT</p>\n<p id=\"b539-11\">To be eligible for relief under the CAT, \u201can applicant must show that it is more likely than not that she will be tortured upon return to her country.\u201d <em>Hamida v. Gonzales, </em>478 F.3d 734, 741 (6th Cir.2007) (citing 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(c)(2)). \u201cTorture is an extreme form of cruel and inhuman treatment and does not include lesser forms of cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment that do not amount to torture.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.18(a)(2). Evidence of past torture inflicted upon the applicant is one of the factors used to evaluation whether it is more likely than not that an applicant would be tortured upon removal. The IJ rejected Djokovic\u2019s request for protection under the CAT on the grounds that: (1) Djokovic\u2019s statements concerning the alleged torture were not credible; and (2) even if they were, \u201cthe single incident of brief confinement and beating\u201d did not rise to the level of torture as defined in the CAT. As we have already noted, the IJ\u2019s credibility assessment was flawed. Nevertheless, we affirm the IJ\u2019s conclusion. Even if Djokovic\u2019s testimony is taken as credible, the incident complained of did not constitute past torture and Djokovic introduced no other significant evidence to establish that it was more likely than not that he would be tortured if removed. The IJ\u2019s finding is supported by substantial evidence and we accordingly affirm.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b532-7\">. Djokovic was born in Tuzi, Montenegro, which at the time of his birth was part of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. In 2003, Yugoslavia was formally abolished and Montenegro became part of an entity called \"Serbia and Montenegro.\u201d On June 3, 2006, this entity was also formally abolished when Montenegro declared its independence. Serbia and Montenegro are now two independent countries.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b532-15\">. In 2002, the INS was abolished by the Homeland Security Act, Pub.L. No. 107-296, 116 Stat. 2135 (Nov. 25, 2002), and its functions were transferred to various agencies within the Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\"). The Immigration Court and the Board of Immigration Appeals remain part of the Department of Justice. We refer to INS when discussing actions it took during its existence and to DHS for activities after the INS\u2019s abolition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b533-9\">. Most English-language sources spell the country \"Kosovo\u201d, which is also the Serbian spelling. The Albanian spelling is \u201cKosova\u201d or occasionally \"Kosov\u00e9\". A rose by any other name might smell as sweet, but a country by any other name is a highly political issue. Given the country\u2019s recent declaration of independence, we find it more appropriate to adopt the spelling preferred by the government of the new country. Accordingly we use \"Kosova\u201d unless quoting from another source.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b537-10\">. \"Bosnian\u201d refers to citizens of Bosnia, regardless of ethnicity. \"Bosniak,\" however, is <em>un </em>ethnicity.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
