He argues that the district court erred by imposing two consecutive 30-month sentences. Williams asserts that this violated U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.2(c), the \u201cspirit\u201d of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3584, the purposes of the Guidelines, and the statements of the Sentencing Commission. He also contends that the district court erred in the factual findings on which the departure was based.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-10\">In imposing consecutive sentences, the district court upwardly departed under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3 based on the underrepresentation of Williams\u2019s criminal history. The district court relied on the circumstances of the offense, the fact that Williams received no criminal history points for two prior drug trafficking offenses, and Williams\u2019s propensity to continue committing crimes. These are valid factors to consider under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2), and the extent of the district court\u2019s departure was reasonable. <em>See United States v. Zuniga-Peralta, </em>442 F.3d 345, 347-48 (5th Cir.) (upholding departure of almost twice the advisory guidelines range), <em>cert. denied, </em>548 U.S. 918, 126 S.Ct. 2954, 165 L.Ed.2d 975 (2006). Williams\u2019s contention that \u00a7 5G1.2(c) required the district court to impose concurrent sentences is misplaced. The \u201ctotal punishment\u201d referred to in \u00a7 5G1.2(c) does not include upward departures. <em>United States v. Martinez, </em>274 F.3d 897, 904 (5th Cir.2001). Additionally, Williams\u2019s reliance on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 994(0(2) also is misplaced because the court departed under \u00a7 4A1.3, rather than simply imposing consecutive sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b419-15\">Williams\u2019s assertion that the district court\u2019s finding that the marijuana was going directly to street level distribution was eiToneous is without merit because, regardless whether there was marijuana available for Williams to purchase from the undercover agents, the district court\u2019s determination of his intent to distribute the marijuana was not error based on the information in the PSR. Finally, in the absence of a contention by Williams that he provided truthful information or that there were no safety valve briefing discussions, the fact that there is no record evidence of such discussions does not establish that the district court erred in its factual findings. Because Williams has not shown error, plain or otherwise, his sentence is affirmed. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-37, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993); <em>United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764-65 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b419-16\">The district court\u2019s amended judgment does not accurately reflect the charges in the superseding indictment to which Williams pleaded guilty. Accordingly, we modify the amended judgment to state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>that Williams was convicted of \u201cConspiring to attempt to possess with intent to distribute a quantity of marijuana &gt;50 kilograms\u201d and \u201cAttempting to possess with intent to distribute a quantity of marijuana &gt;50 kilograms,\u201d and we strike that portion of the judgment that states that the district court has dismissed \u201ccount 2 of the superseding indictment.\u201d <em>See United States v. Prince, </em>868 F.2d 1379, 1386 (5th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">AFFIRMED as modified.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b419-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
