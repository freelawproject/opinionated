Hutchins, a Florida prisoner, appeals the district court\u2019s dismissal of his petition for writ of habeas corpus as time-barred pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254. Hutchins pled guilty to one count of possession of child pornography with intent to promote and was sentenced to fifteen years\u2019 probation. He later violated his probation, and, as a result, he was sentenced to seven years\u2019 imprisonment. The district court denied Hutchins\u2019s habeas pe<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>tition as time-barred, but it relied on <em>Rainey v. Sec\u2019y for Dep\u2019t of Corrs., </em>443 F.3d 1323 (11th Cir.2006), which we overruled in <em>Ferreira v. Sec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Corrs., </em>494 F.3d 1286, 1292-93 (11th Cir.2007).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b804-3\">We granted a certificate of appeal-ability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on the single issue of whether, in light of <em>Ferreira, </em>the district court erred in determining when Hutch-ins\u2019s judgment became final under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1)(A). We have chosen, however, to expand the COA to include the merits of Hutchins\u2019s habeas petition because, even if we conclude that the petition was timely under <em>Ferreira, </em>we must affirm the district court\u2019s alternative merits-based denial of Hutchins\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-4\">In his habeas petition, Hutchins alleges that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to explicitly define and advise him of a statute of limitations defense pri- or to advising him to waive that defense and plead guilty. Hutchins\u2019s voluntary guilty plea, however, waived any ineffective assistance of counsel claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-5\">Under <em>Wilson v. United States, </em>962 F.2d 996 (11th Cir.1992) (per curiam), a knowing and voluntary guilty plea waives all constitutional challenges to a conviction. <em>Id. </em>at 997. The transcript from the change of plea hearing shows that Hutch-ins was present when the prosecutor informed the court that Hutchins was pleading guilty to a charge that was filed after the statute of limitations had expired. Hutchins indicated, moreover, that he had discussed the case with his attorney, was satisfied with his attorney\u2019s advice, and understood that he was giving up his right to a jury trial. Hutchins further indicated that no one had threatened or forced him to plead guilty, and he expressly waived a statute of limitations challenge at the hearing. As the district court concluded, Hutchins cannot reasonably argue that, had he been better informed concerning the statute of limitations for the count to which he pled guilty, he would have gone to trial and faced all of the 148 counts of child pornography for which he was charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-9\">It is clear that Hutchins knowingly and voluntarily pled guilty to the offense for which he was convicted. He thus waived any ineffective assistance of counsel claim. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of his habeas petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b804-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b804-6\">. In <em>Ferreira </em>we applied the Supreme Court\u2019s recent holding in <em>Burton v.
