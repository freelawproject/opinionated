Principi, </em>01-1841 (June 3, 2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b927-8\">The Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals denied an increased rating for residuals of a gunshot wound and a claim of total disability based on individual unemployability. The Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims vacated the Board\u2019s decision and remanded the case to the Board, and the Secretary appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-9\">This case was stayed pending the court\u2019s disposition in <em>Roan v. Prineipi, </em>2004-7093, which was stayed pending the court\u2019s disposition in <em>Sanders v. Nicholson, </em>487 F.3d 881 (Fed.Cir.2007), and its companion case <em>Simmons v. Nicholson, </em>487 F.3d 892 (Fed. Cir.2007). In <em>Sanders, </em>this court held that any 38 U.S.C \u00a7 5103(a) error should be presumed prejudicial and the Secretary has the burden of rebutting this presumption. <em>Id. </em>at 891.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-10\">The court agrees that summary affirmance of the judgment vacating and remanding to the Board is appropriate in light of our decisions in <em>Simmons </em>and <em>Sanders.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b927-11\">Accordingly,</p>\n<p id=\"b927-12\">IT IS ORDERED THAT:</p>\n<p id=\"b927-13\">(1) The stay of proceedings is lifted.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-14\">(2) The judgment of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims is summarily affirmed. The case is remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b927-15\">(3) Each side shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
