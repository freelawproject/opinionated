The court below found the plea to be good and sufficient ; thereupon complainant filed his replication. The cause being at issue was referred to a master in chancery to take testimony, and to return the same into court with his conclusion of law thereon. Testimony was taken, and the master made and filed his report, in and by which said master concluded, as a matter of law, that the decree mentioned in said plea stands as an absolute adjudication of the rights of the parties upon the merits, and reported and found that the averments of the' plea were sustained.by the evidence.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b719-6\">Exceptions to said master\u2019s report having been overruled by the 'court and the report confirmed, a decree was entered that the defendants\u2019 plea was well taken in law and sustained by the proofs, and the bill was dismissed.

All these elements or conditions exist in this case, as shown by the master\u2019s report, which was to the effect that the averments of said plea were sustained by the evidence; that there was no controversy as to the identity of the cause of action, or of the identity of the parties.in the two suits; that the bili was sworn to by the complainant, and the answer was sworn to by the defendants, and the cause submitted in due course; and that the decree rendered in the suit, pending in the court of Ohio was, as it professed to be, an absolute adjudication of the rights of the parties upon the merits, without any quali\\ fying clause, and was conclusive of the rights attempted to be litigated in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">The dispute, however, seems to be as to the <em>nature </em>of the former judgment \u2014 that is, whether it is a final judgment or decree. It is contended on the part of appellant that such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"701\">*701</page-number>judgment was merely one of <em>nol. pros. </em>\u2014 a decree entered by default \u2014 and is, therefore, not a bar to the prosecution of-this suit. To sustain this view of the case he has recourse to a statement by the clerk of the Circuit Court of the United States for the Southern District of Ohio, (wherein the decree was rendered,) under his hand and seal, dated nearly two years after said decree was rendered, to the effect that no proof or' testimony was filed in said cause in his office either for. the complainant or the defendant; that at the time of the granting of said decree, May 4,1882, the complainant did riot appear, nor was he represented by counsel; and that said decree dismissing the complainant\u2019s bill was granted on default of the complainant.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-4\">The decree itself is in.the words and figures following, to wit:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-5\">\u201cThe United States of America, Western Division of the Southern District of Ohio,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-7\">\u201c At a stated term of the Circuit Court of the Western \u2022 Division of the Southern District of Ohio, in the sixth judicial circuit of the United States of America, begun and had in the court-rooms at the city of Cincinnati, Ohio, in said district, on th\u00e9 first Tuesday of April, being th\u00e9 fourth day of that month, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and eighty-two, and of the independence of the United States of Axrierica the one hundred and sixth.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-8\">\u201cPresent: The Hon. John Baxter, Circuit Judge, and Hon. Philip B. Swing, District Judge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-9\">\u201cOn Thursday, the fourth day of May, 1882, among the \u2022proceedings had were the following, to wit <em>% </em>,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-10\">\u201cNelson Lyon <em>\\ \u25a0v. \u25a0 </em>\u2022 3180. In-Equity. The Perin and Gaff Manufacturing Co.)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b721-13\">\u201cThis cause coming on for hearing, and, being submitted to the court upon bill-, answer, and replication, and having been duly considered, the court finds, adjudges, and decrees <em>that the equities are with the defendant </em>/ that the bill of complaint be dismissed, and that defendant recover its costs, to be taxed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AUDK\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"702\">*702</page-number>. This is the record to which the court must look, and not to the statement of the clerk of the,'court made two years afterwards. This decree on its face is absolute in its terms, is an adjudication of the merits of the controversy, and, therefore, constitutes a bar to any further litigation of the same subject between the same parties. As was said by this court in <em>Durant </em>v. <em>Essex Company, </em>7 Wall. 107, 109, \u201cA decree of that kind, unless made because of some defect in the pleadings, or for want of jurisdiction, or because the complainant has an adequate remedy at law, or upon some other ground which does not go to the merits, is a final determination. Where words of qualification, such as \u2018without prejudice,\u2019 or other terms indicating a right or privilege to take further legal proceedings on the subject, do not accompany the de.cree, it is presumed to be rendered on the merits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b722-5\">To the same effect see <em>Bigelow </em>v. <em>Windsor, </em>1 Gray, 299, 301, where it is said : \u201c Sometimes, indeed, a party plaintiff in equity, who, because he is not prepared with his proofs, or for other reasons, desires not to go into a hearing, but rather to have his bill dismissed, in the nature of a discontinuance or non-suit in an action at law, may be allowed to do so; but we believe the uniform practice in such case is to enter \u2018 dismissed without prejudice.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b722-6\">Likewise Cooper Eq. PL 270, as follows: \u201cA plea in bar, stating a dismissal of a.former bill, is conclusive against a new bill, if the dismissal was upon hearing, and if that dismissal be not, in direct terms, \u2018 without prejudice. \u2019 \u201d See also Story\u2019s Eq. Pl. \u00a7 793, and authorities there cited.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-7\">The authorities to sustain this view of the case might oe multiplied, but those cited are sufficient, and demonstrate the uniformity of the rule. It is clear to this court that the decree below dismissing the bill is in harmony with the law, and it is, therefore,</p>\n<p id=\"b722-8\">\n<em>Affirmed</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
