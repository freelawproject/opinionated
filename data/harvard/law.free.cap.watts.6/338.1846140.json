Spalding, to recover the amount of a book account. The plaintiff was called to prove his book of original entries. The defendant objected to his being sworn, and gave in evidence the record of his conviction of burglary.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b338-8\">The plaintiff then offered in evidence, a copy of the minutes of the proceedings of the governor, by which it appeared that the plaintiff had been pardoned before the expiration of his sentence, which was duly certified by the secretary of the commonwealth to be truly copied.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b338-9\">The defendant objected to the evidence, on the ground that the pardon itself was the only legal evidence of the fact; but the court overruled the objection and the plaintiff was admitted to testify.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b338-10\">Williston, for plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"ALZ\">cited 2 <em>Stark.

The English law requires it to be authenticated with the great seal, because the king\u2019s sign manual or privy seal maybe retracted. Gully\u2019s Case, <em>Leach </em>116; Rex <em>v. </em>Warwick, 5 <em>St. Tr. </em>166, and Rex <em>v. </em>Miller, 2 <em>Bl. Rep. </em>797, are in point. Are the governor\u2019s minutes less revocable ?\u2022 The recital in the extract that the pardon was granted, amounts but to a present decision in favour of the convict\u2019s prayer, and an order to <em>let the </em>warrant issue; but till it was actually issued, it might be recalled. The minute, therefore, was not primary evidence of a pardon, though it might be competent if the warrant were shown to be lost or destroyed.</p>\n<p id=\"b338-13\">Judgment reversed, and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
