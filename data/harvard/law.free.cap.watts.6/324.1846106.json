The plaintiffs filed a statement and referred the cause to arbitrators who made a report for the plaintiff for 378 dollars 45 cents. A motion was made in the court below to set aside the award on two grounds. First, because there was no declaration filed; and secondly, because it was not the subject of reference under the arbitration law.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b325-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"325\">*325</page-number>The court below (Scott, president) overruled the objections.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b325-6\"><em>Ellis </em>and <em>Parsons, </em>for plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AvS0\">on the first point, cited 2 <em>Park &amp; Johns.

Rep. </em>396, because it is a subject of discretionary relief to be administered only by the court; but in Kelley <em>v. </em>Stepney, 4 <em>Watts </em>69, an insolvent\u2019s bond was considered as an ordinary obligation to do a particular act, whose performance alone can exonerate the bail, who is rather a surety in the strict sense of the word: insomuch, that a surrender before the day does not discharge him. It is, therefore, on a footing with a recognizance of bail in error, which was deemed arbitrable in Stevenson <em>v. </em>Docherty, 3 <em>Watts </em>176. Being thus determinable by a popular tribunal, the cause of action may be set out in a statement, without the technicality of a declaration.</p>\n<p id=\"b325-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
