Nicholas Nieman against the executors of Frederick Bentz, deceased. \u2014 The testator by his will bequeathed to the plaintiff a legacy of 100 dollars, and to others pecuniary legacies of a certain amount, and the residue of his estate to John Malone and John Myers, whom he named as his executors. A caveat was entered against the probate of the will, and an issue was directed to try its validity. The will was established, and the expenses incident to the trial were 736 dollars. The only question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>in the court below was whether all the legatees were bound to contribute to this expense by an abatement of their legacies.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b86-6\">The court (Durkee, president) instructed the jury that the specific pecuniary legatees were not liable to contribute, and the plaintiff was entitled to recover the whole amount of his legacy.
