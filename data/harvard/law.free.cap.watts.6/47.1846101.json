B. &amp; T. Hunt. This action originated before a justice of the peace, from whose judgment the defendants appealed. In court, the plaintiff filed a declaration containing two counts: the first charged the defendants with having received as common carriers in Philadelphia, goods to be delivered at Harrisburg, which they carried so negligently and carelessly that the same were lost, &amp;c.; and the second charged the defendants generally with not having delivered the goods according to their engagement.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"4\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b47-13\">The defendants\u2019 counsel contended in the court below, that the justice had not jurisdiction of the cause of action; but the court (Blythe, president) was of a different opinion.

But Powell <em>v. </em>Layton, 2 N. <em>R. </em>365, is the specific case before the court. To an action on the case in the form of a tort against a common carrier, the defendant successfully pleaded in abatement the non-joinder of his partners, which he could not have done had the action not been founded in contract. The word \u201c suscepit\u201d was not in the declaration, and the word \u201cduty\u201d was in\u2019its place; but the chief justice, delivering the opinion of the court, held that to be indifferent, because the duty of a carrier necessarily springs from his contract alone. The conflict of authority on the subject was critically examined by him, and, we think, the proper conclusion deduced from them. Also in Dale <em>v. </em>Hall, 1 <em>Wils. </em>282, Mr Justice Dennison expressed an opinion that the action is essentially founded in contract whether the word <em>suscepit </em>is in the declaration or not. Here, however, an <em>express </em>undertaking is laid; and there cannot be a doubt, therefore, that the justice had jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-8\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
