The witness then ceased to bid. Other witnesses were then called, by whom the plaintiffs offered to prove that they were at the sale, and were deterred from bidding by the rumour, at the time, that M\u2019Kennan was buying the land <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"138\">*138</page-number>for the widow and children. This evidence was objected to, but the objection was overruled, and exception taken by defendants.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b138-6\">The court below (Reed, president) in answer to points propounded to them by the defendant\u2019s counsel, instructed the jury, that the plaintiffs\u2019 right to recover was not founded upon the allegation of a trust, but of a fraud on the part of the defendant: that if the jury believed that no trust existed between the parties, but that the defendant made use of the names of the plaintiffs, at the time of the sale by the sheriff, for the fraudulent purpose of preventing others from bidding, and to enable him to buy the land at a reduced price, the plaintiffs were entitled to recover without refunding, or offering to refund to the defendant the money which he paid for the land to the sheriff.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b138-7\">The admission of the evidence mentioned in the bills of exception, and this charge of the court, were assigned as error.</summary>\n<attorneys data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b138-8\"><em>J. Fisher, </em>for plaintiff in error,</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"Ai_\">cited 8 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle </em>484; 1 <em>Rawle </em>408.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b138-9\"><em>Parker </em>and <em>Benedict, </em>contra.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b138-10\">The opinion of the Court was delivered by</p>\n<author id=\"b138-11\">Rogers, J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ag9d\">If the defendant was a trustee, it cannot be doubted that the plaintiffs could not recover, without payment or tender of the purchase money; but this the plaintiff denied, and the cause went to the jury on the ground that the defendant had been guilty of fraud, and the jury having so found, this cannot be distinguished, in principle, from Gilbert <em>v. </em>Hoffman, <em>2 Watts 66. No </em>objection can be taken to the charge; for if the vendee alleged that he was purchasing for the children, when, in truth, he was purchasing for himself, it was not incumbent on the plaintiff to show, or the jury to find, that the plaintiff was actually defrauded out of any certain sum. If the defendant designed a fraud by using the falsehoods imputed to him, and gained his object in purchasing the land, without a fair competition, it was such a fraud as vitiated the sale.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-12\">The objection to the evidence cannot be sustained. After having proved the declarations of M\u2019Kennan that he was bidding for the children, it was competent to show, by the testimony of others who were present at the time of the sale, that they left off bidding in consequence of a report that M\u2019Kennan was purchasing the property for the benefit of the family. The other exceptions have not been pressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-13\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
