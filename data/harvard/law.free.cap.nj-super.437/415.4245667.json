(Karnavati), a corporation located in India.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Plaintiff Rajnikant Patel<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> alleged the defective design of a RIMEK UNIK-1 tablet press machine (the machine) manufactured in India by Karnavati caused him to suffer personal injuries while working on the New Jersey premises of his employer, Neil Laboratories/Advent Pharmaceuticals (Neil Labs). On our leave granted, Karnavati appeals from the Law Division\u2019s December 19, 2013 order denying its motion to dismiss plaintiffs complaint for lack of jurisdiction. <em>R. </em>4:6-2(b). Karnavati argues the motion judge\u2019s finding of minimum <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>contacts is factually flawed leading to an erroneous legal conclusion. We agree and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">The recital of the arduous procedural history detailing plaintiffs efforts to join and serve parties and proceed with his suit is not necessary to our discussion of whether New Jersey has jurisdiction over Karnavati. We limit our discussion to those facts found in the motion record that are relevant to our analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">Plaintiff resides in Middlesex County and is employed by Neil Labs, working at its facility in East Windsor. Plaintiff suffered \u201csevere personal injuries\u201d at the facility on November 4, 2008, when a towel he was using to clean the machine while it was running, caught and pulled his left hand into the machine. Plaintiff alleges \u201c[t]he safety interlocks [on the machine] were either bypassed and/or inoperable.\u201d Among the claims included in his complaint are: the machine was \u201cdefectively designed, manufactured, and/or maintained, causing same to fail\u201d; express and implied warranties were breached; negligence occurred in the \u201cdesign, manufacture, sale, distribution, inspection, maintenance and/or repair\u201d of the machine; and the failure to warn of the machine\u2019s unreasonably dangerous propensities caused injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">Karnavati moved to dismiss the complaint in lieu of filing an answer. Jurisdictional discovery was conducted.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">Mukund Modi, Karnavati\u2019s Senior Vice President, filed a certification averring Karnavati, which manufactures tablet press machines used in the pharmaceutical industry, was incorporated and operates in India. Although it manufactured the machine asserted to cause plaintiffs injuries, Karnavati never shipped its machines to New Jersey. In fact, since its incorporation, Karnavati only shipped one product to the United States, when it sent a different device to Maryland, in December 2003. Modi certified Karnavati is not registered to do business in New Jersey; does not advertise in New Jersey; has never engaged in any sales in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>New Jersey; has never solicited business from or paid taxes to the state; has never attended trade shows or conferences \u201cfor the purposes of displaying its tablet press machines, in New Jersey or elsewhere in the United States\u201d; and has never sent its employees to New Jersey for any reason. Additionally, Karnavati never owned, used, or possessed real or personal property in New Jersey; owned or controlled any state bank accounts; or maintained insurance for products liability conduct in the state.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">Karnavati sold the machine in question to GlobePharma, Inc. (Globe) in 2002. Globe is a closely held corporation, with a place of business in New Brunswick. Globe \u201cdesign[s], manufactur\u00e9is], and s[ells] ... unit-dose samplers for powders used in pharmaceutical and nutritional supplement manufacturing[,]\u201d as well as \u201cnew and used pharmaceutical and nutritional supplement machinery such as ... table-top rotary tablet press machines.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">The purchase order for the subject machine was prepared by Globe and sent to Karnavati. Globe sought two machines described as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-8\">Double Rotary Tablet Press[es], Model KEB-4/35, with 35 stations for IPT, standard B tooling, GMP model with sturdy acrylic guards AC variable speed drive, gravity feed system, manual lubrication system, safety interlocks and the modifications suggested by Neil [Labs], a list of which was already sent to Mr. Nalk.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">In the \u201cTerms &amp; Conditions\u201d section of the purchase order, Globe provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b449-10\">A representative from Neil Labs will visit Karnavati for trial running of the machines. A pharmaceutical powder (which will be shipped from Hyderabad to Karnavati) will be run on these machines. Neil Labs may bring their own tooling or they may need tooling from Karnavati. Neil Labs has to be totally satisfied before the machines are accepted. Modifications suggested by Neil Labs are of essence for acceptance of the machines by Neil Labs.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b449-11\">The machine was sent by sea, freight on board, to Globe, which took possession in Mumbai, India. Globe paid for the machine before it left India.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-12\">This was not the first time Globe and Karnavati did business. In January 1998, Globe and Karnavati executed an \u201cExclusive Distribution Agreement,\u201d under which Karnavati agreed to exclu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>sively supply Globe with \u201cpharmaceutical machinery, especially tablet presses, packaging machinery, and all-purpose equipment\u201d within the territorial limits of North America, for a period of two years. Karnavati agreed to provide a \u201cfull warranty for one year for any manufacturing or material defects towards machines supplied to Globe.\u201d Further, the parties agreed \u201c[i]f specifically required by Globe, [Karnavati] shall provide training to the personnel appointed by Globe in installation, operation, and maintenance of the machines\u201d and provided Karnavati\u2019s technicians would assist Globe. Globe agreed to use its best efforts to generate a specified level of sales during the two-year agreement term. Globe also assumed responsibility to promote and advertise the machines using brochures of the machines supplied by Karna-vati. Finally, the agreement was governed by the laws of India.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">Nothing suggests the exclusive distribution agreement continued beyond the initial two-year period. However, Globe\u2019s president certified, in the course of its business, Globe continued to acquire and resell machinery manufactured by Karnavati, although not on an exclusive basis.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">Following argument of Karnavati\u2019s motion to dismiss, the judge concluded New Jersey courts had jurisdiction because \u201cthere [wa]s a sufficient showing here that the tablet press was made for and sold to a New Jersey company, for the purpose of being used in New Jersey.\u201d The judge distinguished the facts of this matter from those presented in the United States Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in <em>J. McIntyre Machinery, Limited v. Nicastro, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>-, 131 <em>S.Ct. </em>2780,180 L.Ed.2d 765 (2011), reasoning jurisdiction here was not based on Karnavati\u2019s \u201ceffort to market its goods through the United States.\u201d Rather, applying jurisdictional jurisprudence, the judge found the purchase order demonstrated \u201cthe sale and the production of [the machine] was for the purpose of benefitting a New Jersey company in New Jersey.\u201d Relying on this court\u2019s decision in <em>Cruz v. Robinson Engineering Corporation, </em>253 <em>N.J.Super. </em>66, 600 A.2d 1238 (App.Div.), <em>certif. denied, </em>130 <em>N.J. </em>9, 611 A.2d 648 (1992), the judge reasoned New Jersey <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>courts had personal jurisdiction because Karnavati had \u201cpurposely-availed itself of this jurisdiction and c[ould] be hailed into court ... in New Jersey to address a personal injury complaint\u201d arising from the use of the machine it manufactured and designed for Neil Labs.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">On December 6, 2013, an order memorializing these findings was filed. The motion judge filed an amplification of his determination, pursuant to <em>Bule </em>2:5-l(b), once leave to appeal was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">\u201cThe question of in personam jurisdiction is a mixed question of law and fact[.]\u201d <em>Citibank, N.A. v. Estate of Simpson, </em>290 <em>N.J.Super. </em>519, 532, 676 A.2d 172 (App.Div.1996). In our review, we examine whether the trial court\u2019s factual findings are \u201csupported by substantial, credible evidence\u201d in the record. <em>Mastondrea v. Occidental Hotels Mgmt. </em>S.A, 391 <em>N.J.Super. </em>261, 268, 918 A.2d 27 (App.Div.2007). However, whether these facts support the court\u2019s exercise of \u201cpersonal jurisdiction over a defendant is a question of law,\u201d which we review de novo. <em>YA Global Invs., L.P. v.

The essence of defendant\u2019s position, which is repeated before us, is the single sale of a product to an independent corporation in India, even if accompanied by the knowledge the product will be delivered to a user in New Jersey, is insufficient to allow the application of long-arm jurisdiction. The trial judge rejected consideration of <em>Nicastro, </em>finding it factually distinguishable from this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">In <em>Nicastro, </em>a British manufacturer sold its machines to an independent distributor in the United States, and had no contacts with New Jersey, where the plaintiff was injured while using one of the machines sold in the United States. <em>Nicastro, supra, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>at-, 131 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2785-86,180 L.Ed.2d at 772-73 (plurality op.).

Justice Kennedy specifically examined the holding of the New Jersey Supreme Court, which concluded \u201ca foreign manufacturer that places a defective product in the stream of commerce through a distribution scheme that targets a national market, which includes New Jersey, may be subject to the personal jurisdiction of a New Jersey court in a product-liability action.\u201d <em>Nicastro v. McIntyre Mach. Am., Ltd,., </em>201 <em>N.J. </em>48, 73, 987 A.2d 575 (2010). The majority of the Court reversed the New Jersey Supreme Court\u2019s holding, rejecting its expansion of the stream of commerce theory to the point where \u201ca producer is subject to jurisdiction for a products-liability action so long as it \u2018knows or reasonably should know that its products are distributed through a nationwide distribution system that might lead to those products being sold in any of the fifty states.\u2019\u201d <em>Nicastro, supra, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>at-, 131 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2793, 180 L.Ed.2d at 780 (plurality op.)

In other words, the defendant must \u2018purposefully avai[l] itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws[.]\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at -, 131 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2788, 180 L.Ed.2d at 775 (quoting <em>Hanson, supra, </em>357 <em>U.S. </em>at 253, 78 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1240, 2 L.Ed.2d at 1298). \u201cThe defendant\u2019s transmission of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"428\">*428</page-number>goods permits the exercise of jurisdiction only where the defendant can be said to have targeted the forum; as a general rule, it is not enough that the defendant might have predicted that its goods will reach the forum State.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Further, Justice Kennedy flatly rejected the New Jersey Supreme Court\u2019s reliance on public policy concerns, including a state's \u201c\u2018strong interest in protecting its citizens from defective products,\u2019 \u201d explaining: \u201c[t]hat interest is doubtless strong, but the Constitution commands restraint before discarding liberty in the name of expediency.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 131 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2791, 180 L.Ed.2d at 778 (quoting <em>Nicastro, supra, </em>201 <em>N.J. </em>at 75, 987 A.2d 575).</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">Justice Breyer agreed the New Jersey Supreme Court\u2019s opinion must be reversed, but wrote separately, providing precedential support to avoid what he viewed as the inclusion of unnecessarily \u201cbroad pronouncements that refashion basic jurisdictional rules.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at \u2014, 131 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2793, 180 L.Ed.2d at 780 (Breyer, J., concurring). In concluding personal jurisdiction was not supported, he explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b456-7\">None of our precedents finds that a single isolated sale, even if accompanied by the land of sales effort indicated here, is sufficient. Rather, this Court\u2019s previous holdings suggest the contrary. The Court has held that a single sale to a customer who takes an accident-causing product to a different State (where the accident takes place) is not a sufficient basis for asserting jurisdiction. <em>See World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, </em>444 <em>U.S. </em>286, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>559, 62 L.Ed.2d 490 (1980). And the Court, in separate opinions, has strongly suggested that a single sale of a product in a State does not constitute an adequate basis for asserting jurisdiction over an out-of-state defendant, even if that defendant places his goods in the stream of commerce, fully aware (and hoping) that such a sale will take place. <em>See Asahi Metal Industry Co. v. Superior Court of Cal, Solana Cty., </em>480 <em>U.S. </em>102, 111, 112, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>1026, 94 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>92 (1987) (opinion of O\u2019Connor, J.) (requiring \u201csomething more\u201d than simply placing \u201ca product into the stream of commerce,\u201d even if defendant is \u201cawar[ej\u201d that the stream \u201cmay or will sweep the product into the forum State\u201d); <em>id, </em>at 117, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>1026, 94 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>92 (Brennan, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (jurisdiction should lie where a sale in a State is part of \u201cthe regular and anticipated flow\u201d of commerce into the State, but not where that sale is only an \u201cedd[y],\u201d <em>i.e., </em>an isolated occurrence); id., at 122, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>1026, 94 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>92 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (indicating that \u201cthe volume, the value, and the hazardous character\u201d of a good may affect the jurisdictional inquiry and emphasizing <em>Asahi\u2019s </em>\u201cregular course of dealing\u201d).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b457-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"429\">*429</page-number><em>[Nicastro, supra, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>at-, 131 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2792, 180 L.Ed.2d at 779 (Breyer, J., concurring).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">In this matter, plaintiff and Globe challenge Karnavati\u2019s position that it is not subject to suit in New Jersey, and advance the correctness of the motion judge\u2019s conclusion in favor of New Jersey\u2019s exercise of personal jurisdiction. Factual support for the Law Division\u2019s conclusion is garnered from the 1998 distribution agreement between Karnavati and Globe, which is suggested to establish Karnavati\u2019s knowledge its products would be sold in New Jersey; the subject machine was sold pursuant to the distribution agreement; and the machine was custom-made specifically for and sold to Neil Labs, a New Jersey company, for use in New Jersey, evidencing Karnavati\u2019s intent to benefit an entity in the State. Regarding this last point, the judge\u2019s opinion noted: the purchase order expresses the machines must be tailored to Neil Labs\u2019 specifications and must include \u201csafety interlocks and ... modifications suggested by Neil [Labs]\u201d; \u201c[m]odifications suggested by Neil Labs\u201d were \u201cof essence\u201d for its acceptance of the machines; and Neil Labs could \u201csend a representative to Karnavati for a trial run to ensure operation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">Additionally, plaintiff and Globe reiterate the applicability of our analysis in <em>Cruz, </em>which the trial judge found persuasive. <em>Cruz </em>involved a products liability claim by a New Jersey plaintiff injured on the New Jersey industrial premises of his employer while using a heavy-duty urn filter press manufactured by the California defendant. Cruz, <em>supra, </em>253 <em>N.J.Super, </em>at 68, 600 A.2d 1238. This court found no need to consider the stream of commerce theory when analyzing the jurisdictional challenge. Rather, we found adequate, undisputed facts proving the defendant manufacturer had engaged in \u201cpurposeful conduct\u201d with New Jersey, warranting the exercise of specific jurisdiction. <em>Id. </em>at 73, 600 A.2d 1238. Assessing the defendant\u2019s contacts, we noted the machine at issue was \u201ca major industrial piece of equipment,\u201d described as the \u201ccornerstone\u201d of the employer\u2019s \u201centire industrial operation, custom-ordered, custom produced and taking over a year to fabricate.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The facts clearly demonstrated the defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"430\">*430</page-number>manufacturer \u201ccertainly understood ... that the subject of the agreement was not only to be shipped to New Jersey but was, moreover, the <em>sine qua non </em>of [the employer\u2019s] plant, the predicate of the whole New Jersey operation.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">Although <em>Cruz </em>involved a single direct sale to New Jersey, the imposition of jurisdiction was based on the facts that demonstrate significant, repeated interactions occurred over the course of one year between the New Jersey employer which purchased the machine and the foreign manufacturer. <em>Id. </em>at 74, 600 A.2d 1238. Letters, phone calls and personal meetings took place as the parties worked together to customize and deliver the machine. <em>Id. </em>at 74, 600 A.2d 1238. Again, both parties knew the New Jersey employer had no business without the machine. <em>Id. </em>at 75, 600 A.2d 1238. The totality of these numerous contacts were found to satisfy due process allowing New Jersey\u2019s exercise of jurisdiction over the nonresident manufacturer, a decision that did \u201c \u2018not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\u2019\u201d <em>Nicastro, supra, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>at, 131 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2787, 180 L.Ed.2d at 774 (plurality op.) (quoting <em>Int\u2019l Shoe, supra, </em>326 <em>U.S. </em>at 316, 66 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 158, 90 <em>L.Ed. </em>at 102).</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">We cannot agree the facts in this matter square with those in <em>Cruz. </em>This transaction, between Karnavati and Globe, took place through Karnavati\u2019s office in India. The record does not reflect the level of interaction between Karnavati and Neil Labs in New Jersey, distinguishing these facts from the significant contacts shown between the manufacturer and buyer in <em>Cruz. </em>In <em>Cruz, </em>the contacts between the manufacturer and the forum included a series of deliberate interactions over an extended period, to ensure the machine, which was essential to the buyer\u2019s operations, complied with the buyer\u2019s required specifications for use in New Jersey. Here, there is no information supporting a finding of a course of interaction between Neil Labs and Karnavati in negotiating this sale, or showing the parties worked together to customize the machine for use in New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"431\">*431</page-number>Further, unlike in <em>Cruz, </em>the record does not support a finding the machine was either unique or pivotal to Neil Labs\u2019 New Jersey operations. The purchase order drawn up by Globe allows Neil Labs the right to inspect the machine prior to its delivery; however, we are not told whether this occurred, and, if inspection in fact took place, the record is silent as to the time and place, and whether the inspection was conducted by Globe or Karnavati.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">Contrary to the motion judge\u2019s finding, Karnavati\u2019s sale to Globe was not pursuant to their exclusive distribution agreement, because that agreement had expired two years earlier. We also reject the trial judge\u2019s determination that Karnavati merely used Globe as an intermediary to ship the machine. In fact, Neil Labs was Globe\u2019s customer and it was Globe which ordered the machine. There is no legal relationship between Kamavati and Globe; they are separate and distinct entities, independently conducting their respective businesses. Thus, we are left with only the purchase order, which the motion judge concluded supplied Karnavati\u2019s contacts with the forum, placing it on notice it would be subject to suit in New Jersey. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">First, we reject the contention that Karnavati\u2019s fulfillment of Globe\u2019s purchase order in India, which referenced Globe\u2019s intended resale to a New Jersey resident, suggested the regularity in manner and magnitude of sales to a distributor or retailer in a forum state requisite to the exercise of jurisdiction by the forum under a <em>post-Nicastro </em>stream of commerce theory. The facts presented speak generally of other national sales, and offer no evidence of Karnavati\u2019s marketing or promotional efforts. There is no showing Kamavati directed marketing efforts or sales to New Jersey; evinced an intent or purpose to serve the forum by designing the machine for the New Jersey market; or established lines of communication, such as a website, to provide service or advice to New Jersey actual or potential customers. The facts in this record fail to support a finding Karnavati engaged in sales efforts \u201cto serve, directly or indirectly, the market for its product in other States,\u201d as was found in <em>World-Wide Volkswagen, supra, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"432\">*432</page-number>444 <em>U.S. </em>at 297, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 567, 62 L.Ed.2d at 501-02. <em>See also Nicastro, supra, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>at-, 131 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2792, 180 L.Ed.2d at 779 (Breyer, J., concurring) (finding stream of commerce inapplicable when no \u201c \u2018regular ... flow1 or \u2018regular course\u2019 of sales\u2019 \u201d is shown); <em>Asahi supra, </em>480 <em>U.S. </em>at 117, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1035, 94 L.Ed.2d at 107 (Brennan, J., concurring) (\u201c[S]tream of commerce refers not to unpredictable currents or eddies, but to the regular and anticipated flow of products from manufacture to distribution to retail sale.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Second, the facts do not demonstrate the nonresident Karnavati purposefully availed itself of \u201cthe privilege of conducting activities within the forum State, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws.\u201d <em>Hanson, supra, </em>357 <em>U.S. </em>at 253, 78 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1240, 2 L.Ed.2d at 1298. As noted above, the record lacks proof of Karnavati\u2019s course of dealing with the forum generally or with Neil Labs specifically, with respect to effectuating the sale of the machine. Neither plaintiff nor Globe discuss the extent of contacts specific to this machine, facts found essential to this court\u2019s finding in <em>Cruz. </em>Other than pointing to the language in the purchase order, Globe and plaintiff fail to identify specific actions by Karnavati which demonstrate its desire to conduct business in New Jersey. Plaintiff and Globe do not reveal whether Karnavati altered its standard machine in preparing the order at issue; whether Karnavati\u2019s employees offered Neil Labs training or expertise; or whether Neil Labs called Karnavati at any time with regard to the machine order.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">In extending jurisdiction based upon purposeful availment, we measure a nonresident defendant\u2019s purposeful conduct connecting it to the forum, not \u201cthe unilateral activity of another who merely claims a relationship to the defendant[.]\u201d <em>Charles Gendler, supra, </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>at 471, 508 A.2d 1127 (quoting <em>Hanson, supra, </em>357 <em>U.S. </em>at 253, 78 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1240, 2 L.Ed.2d at 1298). <em>See also Waste Mgmt., supra, </em>138 <em>N.J. </em>at 121, 649 A.2d 379. Simply stated, the issue is notice: \u201c[t]he defendant\u2019s contacts with the forum state must be such that it \u2018should reasonably anticipate being haled into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>court there.\u2019 \u201d <em>Charles Gendler, supra, </em>102 <em>N.J. </em>at 470, 508 A.2d 1127 (quoting <em>World-Wide Volkswagen, supra, </em>444 <em>U.S. </em>at 297, 100 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 567, 62 L.Ed.2d at 501).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Here, we are presented only with Globe\u2019s purchase order, which noted its sale to Neil Labs. We would be hard-pressed to conclude Karnavati\u2019s sale of a machine to Globe in India, for Globe\u2019s resale to Neil Labs in New Jersey shows Karnavati\u2019s purposeful availment of business opportunities that support the exercise of personal jurisdiction in New Jersey. More is needed. The trial court\u2019s determination that the necessary jurisdictional contacts were satisfactorily shown on these limited facts alone was erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">Globe also maintains the effects of the expired distribution agreement evince Karnavati\u2019s contacts with the State, and such past contacts support personal jurisdiction. Certainly, Globe\u2019s prior relationship gave it familiarity with Karnavati\u2019s products. However, as Justice Kennedy explained in <em>Nicastro, </em>when a defendant manufacturer\u2019s conduct consists of mere \u201csales efforts\u201d to sell its machines in the United States through a distributor, but does not target the New Jersey market in particular, jurisdiction in the specific State forum does not lie. <em>Nicastro, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>at -, 131 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2786,180 L.Ed.2d at 773 (plurality op.). Absent additional evidential support activities within the forum, Globe\u2019s theory is unpersuasive.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-10\">As noted above, plaintiff bears the burden of pleading sufficient facts to establish jurisdiction. Following our review of this record, we conclude he has failed to do so. The record is insufficient to support the conclusion Karnavati\u2019s conduct surrounding the sale of the tablet press machine involved in plaintiff\u2019s injuries constituted \u201cpurposeful acts\u201d for which Karnavati would be on notice that it would be subject to suit in New Jersey. <em>Accura Zeisel Mach. Corp. v. Timco, Inc., </em>305 <em>NJ.Super. </em>559, 566, 702 A.2d 1340 (App.Div.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-11\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b447-13\"> The complaint also named Karnavati\u2019s corporate affiliates, Karnavati America, LLC (KAL) and Cadila Pharmaceutical, Ltd.
