We reject Y.L.\u2019s argument that the Board must find she had an intent to deceive, and affirm the Board\u2019s denial, which required Y.L. to wait two years before reapplying for a license.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">In both the application and the accompanying authorization for a background check Y.L. submitted in 2012, she swore that she had never been arrested for any crime or offense. She signed an affidavit stating: \u201c[a]ll information provided in connection with this application is true to the best of my knowledge and belief. I understand that any omissions, inaccuracies or failure to make full disclosure may be deemed sufficient to deny licensure[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">She certified similarly on the authorization. The Board discovered that Y.L. had been arrested for prostitution, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:34-1, in a massage therapy establishment in 2004. The charge was later dismissed. Y.L. wrote the Board a letter explaining that she did not read the application questions carefully and mistakenly neglected to acknowledge the arrest. She indicated that \u201cEnglish is not my primary language\u201d and denied having engaged in prostitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">After retaining counsel, she submitted an affidavit again attributing the mistake to her difficulty understanding English and also the fact that a friend had completed the application for her. She revealed for the first time that she was licensed as a massage therapist in Florida, another fact she had failed to mention in her original application. She stated that it was never her intention to deceive the Board. Y.L. is otherwise qualified for a license.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>Our scope of review of an administrative agency action is limited and highly deferential. So long as the Board\u2019s decision is supported by sufficient credible evidence in the record and was neither \u201carbitrary, capricious, [nor] unreasonable,\u201d it will be affirmed. <em>Brady v. Bd. of Review, </em>152 <em>N.J. </em>197, 210, 704 A.2d 547 (1997) (citing <em>In re Warren, </em>117 <em>N.J. </em>295, 296, 566 A.2d 534 (1989)). In making this determination, a reviewing court must examine: \u201c(1) whether the agency\u2019s decision conforms with relevant law; (2) whether the decision is supported by substantial credible evidence in the record; and (3) whether, in applying the law to the facts, the administrative agency clearly erred in reaching its conclusion.\u201d <em>Twp. Pharmacy v. Div. of Med. Assistance &amp; Health Servs., </em>432 <em>N.J.Super. </em>273, 283-84, 74 A.3d 959 (2013) (citing <em>In re Stallworth, </em>208 <em>N.J. </em>182, 194, 26 A.3d 1059 (2011)).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">We also review factual findings made by an administrative agency deferentially. On appeal, \u201cthe test is not whether an appellate court would come to the same conclusion if the original determination was its to make, but rather whether the factfinder could reasonably so conclude upon the proofs.\u201d <em>Brady, supra, </em>152 <em>N.J. </em>at 210, 704 A.2d 547 (quoting <em>Charatan v. Bd. of Review, </em>200 <em>N.J.Super. </em>74, 79, 490 A.2d 352 (App.Div.1985)). So long as the \u201cfactual findings are supported \u2018by sufficient credible evidence, courts are obliged to accept them.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ibid, </em>(quoting <em>Self v. Bd. of Review, </em>91 <em>N.J. </em>453, 459, 453 A.2d 170 (1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\"><em>N.J.S.A </em>45:1-21 states in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-7\">A board may x\u2019efuse to admit a pei\u2019son to an examination or may x\u2019efuse to issue or may suspend or x'evoke any certificate, registration or license issued by the board upon proof that the applicant ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-8\">b. Has engaged in the use or employment of dishonesty, fraud, deception, misrepresentation, false promise or false pretense;</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">Y.L. argues that because the word \u201cmisrepresentation\u201d is surrounded by words that in her view require an intent to deceive, such as \u201cdishonesty, fraud [and] deception[,]\u201d such an intent should be required for any misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-10\">We recently decided that the Director of the New Jersey Division of Medical Assistance and Health Services (the Director) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>did not err in denying a pharmacy\u2019s application to participate in the State\u2019s Medicaid program due to its unintentional failure to disclose the criminal record of one of its employees. <em>Twp. Pharmacy, supra, </em>432 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 274-75, 74 A.3d 959. We interpreted <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:49-11.l(d)(22), which lists as a reason lor disqualification, \u201c[submission of a false or fraudulent application for the provider status to the Program or its Fiscal Agent.\u201d After a hearing, the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) found that the pharmacist owner\u2019s incorrect answer was \u201cnot intentional or knowing!)]\u201d The ALJ found, however, that the applicant had the \u201cduty to provide truthful, accurate, and complete answers to all questions!.]\u201d The Director adopted the ALJ\u2019s findings in light of the applicant\u2019s certification to the accuracy of the application and noted that <em>N.J.A.C. </em>10:49-11.1(d)(22) does not require an intent to deceive. <em>Twp. Pharmacy, supra, </em>432 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 283, 74 A.3d 959.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">We affirmed, discussing that \u201c[t]he delivery of health care to the public is a highly regulated business activity which directly impacts upon the safety and welfare of the public.\u201d <em>Twp. Pharmacy, supra, </em>432 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 286, 74 A.3d 959 (citations and quotation marks omitted). Massage therapy is also \u201chighly regulated\u201d and also \u201cdirectly impacts the safety and welfare of the public.\u201d Although the wording of the administrative code provision interpreted in <em>Township Pharmacy </em>is not identical to the UEA provision, it is quite similar.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">\u201cThe goal of all statutory interpretation is to give effect to the intent of the Legislature.\u201d <em>Masker v. Ross, </em>219 <em>N.J. </em>565, 575, 99 A.3d 795, 2014 <em>WL </em>4745555 (2014) (citation and quotation marks omitted). When enacting the UEA the legislature indicated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-8\">The Legislature finds and declares that effective implementation of consumer protection laws and the administration of laws pertaining to the professional and occupational boards located within the Division of Consumer Affairs require uniform investigative and enforcement powers and procedures and uniform standards for license revocation, suspension and other disciplinary proceedings by such boards. This act is deemed remedial, and the provisions hereof should be afforded a liberal construction.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b442-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"414\">*414</page-number><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>45:1-14.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">The Attorney General draws our attention to the enforcement of the Consumer Fraud Act (CFA), <em>N.J.S.A. </em>56:8-1 to -20, where \u201cmisrepresentation[,]\u201d a violation of section two of the CFA, does not require an intent to deceive if it results from an \u201caffirmative act[.]\u201d <em>Chattin v. Cape May Greene, Inc., </em>243 <em>N.J.Super. </em>590, 598, 581 A.2d 91 (App.Div.1990), <em>affd o.b., </em>124 <em>N.J. </em>520, 521, 591 A.2d 943 (1991). The CFA and the UEA are both remedial legislation intended to protect the public. <em>D'Agostino v. Maldonado, </em>216 <em>N.J. </em>168, 193, 78 A.3d 527 (2013) (discussing the remedial nature of the CFA); <em>N.J.S.A. </em>45:1-14.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">Contrary to Y.L.\u2019s argument, misrepresentation does not generally require the intent to deceive. \u201cNegligent misrepresentation is a legally sound concept. An incorrect statement, negligently made and justifiably relied upon, may be the basis for recovery of damages for economic loss or injury sustained as a consequence of that reliance.\u201d <em>H. Rosenblum, Inc. v. Adler, </em>93 <em>N.J. </em>324, 334, 461 A.2d 138 (1983). Accepting Y.L.\u2019s explanation for her failure to reveal her arrest, the \u201cmistake\u201d legally constituted at least negligent misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">If we were to accept Y.L.\u2019s argument that the Board must find an intent to deceive whenever an applicant fails to reveal relevant negative information, a testimonial hearing would likely be required in every instance where the applicant alleged the failure was not intentional. The requirement that Y.L. sign an affidavit and a certification put Y.L. on sufficient notice of the need \u201cto provide truthful, accurate and complete answers to all questions[.]\u201d <em>Twp. Pharmacy, supra, </em>432 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 283, 74 A.3d 959.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b439-9\"> We note that an ariest alone is insufficient to deny a license. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>45:1\u2014 21(f).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
