Accordingly, we vacate the order denying <em>Rule </em>4:50 relief and remand the matter for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b120-11\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b120-12\">The Ridge at Back Brook, L.L.C. (plaintiff), a New Jersey limited liability company which owns and operates an eighteen-hole golf course in Ringoes, filed a complaint against defendant W. Thomas Klenert, one of its members, on September 17, 2010. Plaintiff alleged that, by becoming a member, defendant became obligated to timely pay dues and something labeled \u201cOption B\u201d payments. In its complaint, plaintiff asserted that defendant defaulted on these financial obligations in 2004 and, by the time the complaint was filed nearly six years later, defendant owed $77,490 in dues and $10,800 in Option B payments, as well as sales tax and finance charges, for a total obligation of $160,214.40. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>Defendant, appearing on his own behalf, filed an answer denying the material allegations of the complaint. Thereafter, plaintiff served requests for admissions, pursuant to <em>Rule </em>4:22, seeking defendant\u2019s admission of essentially every material aspect of plaintiffs claim. Defendant did not respond.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-5\">Relying on the admissions generated by defendant\u2019s failure to respond to the <em>Rule </em>4:22 requests, as well as by the certification of plaintiffs managing member, plaintiff moved for summary judgment. Prior to the motion\u2019s return date, defendant filed a petition in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey. The summary judgment motion was nevertheless granted on April 1, 2011.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-6\">Plaintiff recognized the order granting summary judgment was ineffectual because defendant\u2019s bankruptcy petition triggered the automatic stay provision contained in 11 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 362. Following the dismissal of the bankruptcy petition on March 21, 2012, plaintiff moved to vacate the April 1, 2011 order granting summary judgment but moved again for summary judgment based on the <em>Rule </em>4:22 admissions, the facts previously asserted in support of its original motion, and a certification explaining how the amount due from defendant had increased to $253,456.01. In a short pro se pleading, defendant cursorily argued that the membership agreement was a contract of adhesion and its terms unconscionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-7\">On June 15, 2012, the trial judge entered an order that: vacated the earlier summary judgment, which was precipitously granted in violation of 11 <em>U.S.C.A </em>\u00a7 362; granted the new summary judgment motion for the full amount sought; and provided that attorneys\u2019 fees would be permitted once a certification of services was submitted.</p>\n<p id=\"b121-8\">In his written decision, the trial judge explained the basis for his ruling. He relied on the fact that defendant had failed to respond to plaintiffs <em>Rule </em>4:22 requests, deeming those assertions to be admitted. The judge recognized that defendant had asserted that the membership agreement was a contract of adhesion and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>unconscionable but that defendant\u2019s brief written response to the renewed summary judgment was insufficient to demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue of material fact. That is, the judge determined that defendant had not provided facts or a further explanation of his view of the contract,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> nor did he contest the amount claimed to be due. On April 20, 2012, the judge awarded plaintiff $8000 in counsel fees and entered final judgment in the amount of $261,456.01.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-5\">Plaintiff immediately sought to collect on the judgment, and obtained an order permitting defendant\u2019s deposition for purposes of identifying available assets; plaintiff also served an information subpoena. Shortly before the August 2012 deposition, counsel appeared for defendant and advised of defendant\u2019s intent to move for relief from the summary judgment pursuant to <em>Rule </em>4:50. Consequently, plaintiff adjourned the deposition but soon thereafter moved for an order compelling defendant\u2019s response to the information subpoena; those responses were provided a few days prior to the motion\u2019s return date.</p>\n<p id=\"b122-6\">In November 2012, defendant moved, through counsel, for relief pursuant to <em>Rule </em>4:50. In his supporting certification, defendant asserted that he became a member of the golf club in 1999 by providing a $45,000 deposit and by signing all the documents plaintiff required. He also asserted that the club did not open until 2002; that year he paid $7500 in dues. In 2003 he paid $10,000, and in 2004 he paid $13,500. Defendant claimed he later learned his dues \u201cwere improperly utilized for capital and debt service, contrary to the terms of the membership agreement, which provided it was to be utilized, if at all, exclusively for operational expenses.\u201d Defendant asserted that plaintiff took this course because \u201cthe project was millions of dollars over budget\u201d even though plaintiff \u201caffirmatively advised\u201d at the contract\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>formation that \u201cthere was no debt and construction was within budget.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b123-5\">Defendant additionally claimed in support of his <em>Rule </em>4:50 motion that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-6\">Eventually, I came to learn that the project was millions of dollars over budget, and it would be the members who would bear the same through extra costs and expenses not disclosed or anticipated at the time in which the membership agreement was entered into.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-7\">More specifically, all existing members were forced to either (1) loan money to the [pjlaintiff to finance the construction of the club house; or (2) pay an extra $2,400.00 per year to finance the construction. Again, this was contrary to my understanding of the agreement entered into and the representations made. Although the club opened for play in July 2002, the promised clubhouse and cart barn were not constructed. The clubhouse was not opened until June 2004. Moreover, the short game area was not completed at the time of my resignation, nor was the cart barn. This was contrary to the original representations. Additionally, the various membership rules continued to change through my tenure as a member, in ways which were not anticipated nor disclosed when I entered into the membership agreement. Apparently, the rules and by-laws allowed the [pjlaintiff to make whatever changes they deemed appropriate regarding membership rights. However, a member had absolutely no redress regarding these rule changes, as there was no absolute right to resign from the club.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b123-8\">From the date of my resignation in 2004 through service of the instant [cjomplaint in November 2010, I never received any demand for payment, notice that I was allegedly in breach of the membership agreement, or any other dunning correspondence. I did occasionally receive bills for dues, but never gave them much thought as I had resigned without objection from [pjlaintiff.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b123-9\">In addressing his failure to make better his ease that the matter was not ripe for summary judgment, defendant asserted that when served with the complaint he \u201cwas in a very stressful financial condition, and could not afford to retain counsel.\u201d He explained that he attempted to represent himself \u201cas best as [he] could,\u201d and he acknowledged that he \u201cclearly did not meet the requirements set forth in the Court Rules.\u201d Defendant further asserted that he misunderstood his obligation to timely respond to plaintiffs <em>Rule </em>4:22 request for admissions.</p>\n<p id=\"b123-10\">Defendant also claimed that the defenses he raised in opposition to summary judgment, as more fully explained in support of his <em>Rule </em>4:50 motion, were found to have credence \u2014 or at least enough substance to avoid summary disposition \u2014 in litigation com<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>menced by other club members in other courts. And he claimed that even if he could be found liable, the amount due had been improperly calculated.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-6\">The trial judge denied the <em>Rule </em>4:50 motion on December 21, 2012. In his written decision, the judge rejected defendant\u2019s unconscionability argument on its merits, but without reference to legal authorities, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b124-7\">[Djefendant cannot assert the contract was unconscionable simply because years later, he is dissatisfied with the terms and is belatedly seeking to stop collection of this [cjourt\u2019s judgment. Defendant was within his full rights to seek membership at a different golf club with different terms in the membership agreement. Instead, defendant willfully entered into an agreement with plaintiff and now, after he has resigned from membership in violation of the [ajgreement, asserts the terms are unconscionable. This is not a sufficient basis to set aside a[n] [o]rder of [flinal [\u00a1judgment. This [cjourt declines to rewrite a contract freely entered into by both parites simply because defendant has now fully appreciated the effect of [a] clause that was unambiguously included in his agreement at the time he entered into it. Moreover, the [cjourt has previously addressed this issue and has found the contract to be valid.<footnotemark>[2]</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b124-8\">The judge also found that defendant, despite being self-represented up to and through the entry of final judgment, had sufficient opportunity to dispute the allegations upon which the judgment was based. And the judge determined that defendant had not moved for relief from the judgment within a reasonable period of time, concluding there were \u201cno exceptional circumstances supplied by defendant that justify vacating a six-month old summary judgment decision, and a four-month old [ojrder of [f]inal judgment.\u201d The judge lastly took note of the troubles to which plaintiff was put during defendant\u2019s delay in seeking relief from the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-9\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b124-10\">On January 30, 2013, defendant filed a notice of appeal that identified only the December 12, 2012 order \u2014 which denied his <em>Rule </em>4:50 motion \u2014 as the order defendant would have us review. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>In his merits brief, however, defendant includes an argument that the trial judge erred in granting summary judgment eight months earlier. Even if we were to ignore defendant\u2019s failure to identify the earlier order in his notice of appeal,* *<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and even if we were to assume the earlier summary judgment may be directly appealed at this late date,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> we would reject this argument. Defendant only factually responded to plaintiffs summary judgment motion by providing conclusory claims that the membership agreement was unconscionable and constituted a contract of adhesion. He never explained why.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Bald assertions are not capable of either support<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"98\">*98</page-number>ing or defeating summary judgment. <em>See Puder v. Buechel, </em>183 <em>N.J. </em>428, 440-41, 874 A.2d 534 (2005); <em>Cortez v. Gindhart, </em>435 <em>N.J.Super. </em>589, 606, 90 A.3d 653 (App.Div.2014); <em>Brae Asset Fund, L.P. v. Newman, </em>327 <em>N.J.Super. </em>129, 134, 742 A.2d 986 (App.Div.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-5\">We, thus, reject the argument that the judge erred in granting summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">The heart of defendant\u2019s appeal lies in the argument that an impecunious pro se litigant, without the wherewithal to understand the requirements of the rules governing civil practice, may be relieved of the consequences of that failure.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">We agree that <em>Rule </em>4:50 \u2014 1(f), which permits relief from orders or judgments for reasons not provided in the rule\u2019s other subsections, allows for relief in circumstances such as this. Our courts have long adhered to the view that subsection (f)\u2019s boundaries \u201care as expansive as the need to achieve equity and justice.\u201d <em>Court Invest. Co. v. Perillo, </em>48 <em>N.J. </em>334, 341, 225 A.2d 352 (1966); <em>see also U.S. Bank Nat. Ass\u2019n v. Guillaume, </em>209 <em>N.J. </em>449, 484, 38 A.3d 570 (2012); <em>Housing Auth. of Town of Morristown v. Little, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>274, 286, 639 A.2d 286 (1994); <em>In re Estate of Thomas, </em>431 <em>N.J.Super. </em>22, 34, 66 A.3d 205 (App.Div.2013); <em>Parker v. Marcus, </em>281 <em>N.J.Super. </em>589, 593, 658 A.2d 1326 (App.Div.1995), <em>certif. denied, </em>143 <em>N.J. </em>324, 670 A.2d 1065 (1996). Judge Havey explained for this court \u2014 in holding that a litigant may, in appropriate circumstances, be relieved of the consequences of his attorney\u2019s negligence in the conduct of a ease \u2014 that the application of the rule turns on the timeliness of the relief sought, the reasons for the movant\u2019s earlier failure to comport with the rules, the movant\u2019s degree of fault or blamelessness as opposed to his attorney\u2019s fault or blame, and the prejudice that would accrue to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"99\">*99</page-number>the other party if relief were granted. <em>Ibid. </em>Appropriate applications of these factors have excused litigants from the negligence of their attorneys in failing to answer interrogatories or other discovery requests. <em>See, e.g., Jansson v. Fairleigh Dickinson Univ., </em>198 <em>N.J.Super. </em>190, 195-96, 486 A.2d 920 (App.Div.1985).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">We find this approach equally applicable where a party has negligently represented himself. To be sure, we do not mean to suggest a self-represented party is entitled to a second chance in all instances \u2014 far from it. We merely hold that a pro se litigant is entitled to nothing less than that to which a litigant is entitled when represented by a negligent attorney. That is, as we held in <em>Rubin v. Rubin, </em>188 <em>N.J.Super. </em>155, 159, 457 A.2d 12 (App.Div. 1982), pro se litigants are not entitled to greater rights than litigants who are represented by counsel. But we also recognized in <em>Rubin </em>\u2014 in concluding that a self-represented litigant was deprived of a meaningful opportunity to be heard due to a lack of understanding of motion practice \u2014 that it is \u201cfundamental that the court system ... protect the procedural rights of all litigants and to accord procedural due process to all litigants.\u201d <em>Ibid. See also Midland Funding LLC v. Albern, </em>433 <em>N.J.Super. </em>494, 500-01, 81 A.3d 689 (App.Div.2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b127-7\">Here, in seeking relief from the summary judgment entered against him, defendant asserted he could not then afford an attorney and that, in attempting to represent himself, he did not understand the consequences of his failure to respond to plaintiffs requests for admissions or what he was required to submit in order to defeat a motion for summary judgment. Had defendant been represented by an attorney whose same acts or omissions led to the same result, the guidelines provided in cases such as <em>Parker </em>would have authorized the granting of <em>Rule </em>4:50 relief. We think defendant is entitled to the same consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-8\">To say that the rule authorized relief, however, does not mean that relief should be granted. We simply remand for a consideration of these principles in light of defendant\u2019s assertions in his <em>Rule </em>4:50 motion. The judge appears to have denied the motion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>solely because he was satisfied that defendant had a prior opportunity to respond to the ultimately successful summary judgment motion. This was insufficient because the judge did not consider why defendant had so failed and whether principles of fairness and equity permit relief from the consequences. Defendant was entitled to have his <em>Rule </em>4:50 motion examined in light of the factors outlined in the authorities discussed above. We, thus, remand for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b128-4\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b128-5\">On remand, the judge should consider defendant\u2019s assertions regarding his earlier failures in the litigation. As to one of the applicable factors \u2014 the timeliness of the <em>Rule </em>4:50 motion \u2014 we reject the judge\u2019s conclusion that defendant\u2019s delay was unreasonable. Indeed, that delay paled in comparison to plaintiffs long delay in commencing the action. And we would note in this regard that in many cases \u2014 and this may be one \u2014 the prejudice incurred by the opposing party may be redressed in ways other than the denial of the motion; <em>Rule </em>4:50-1 authorizes the granting of relief \u201cupon such terms as are just.\u201d <em>See ATFH Real Prop. v. Winberry Rlty., </em>417 <em>N.J.Super. </em>518, 527-29,10 A.3d 889 (App.Div. 2010), <em>certif. denied, </em>208 <em>N.J. </em>337, 27 A.3d 950 (2011).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b128-6\">We would lastly observe that the trial judge\u2019s ruling appears to be based in part on his determination that there was no merit in defendant\u2019s contention that the contract was unconscionable. Certainly, if that were so, the judge\u2019s disposition would have been correct; the granting of <em>Rule </em>4:50 relief would be a futile exercise if plaintiff remained entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See U.S. Bank Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n, supra, </em>209 <em>N.J. </em>at 469, 38 A.3d 570 (observing, in quoting from <em>Schulwitz v. Shuster, </em>27 <em>N.J.Su</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"101\">*101</page-number><em>per. </em>554, 561, 99 A.2d 845 (App.Div.1953), that \u201c[i]t would create a rather anomalous situation if a judgment were to be vacated ... only to discover later that the defendant had no meritorious defense\u201d). But \u2014 once defendant provided substance to his earlier conclusory claims \u2014 the judge never examined the parties\u2019 contentions in light of applicable legal principles. Indeed, the judge largely relied on his earlier holding. The worth of defendant\u2019s contentions should be examined in light of two factors: procedural unconscionability, which \u201ccan include a variety of inadequacies, such as age, literacy, lack of sophistication, hidden or unduly complex contract terms, bargaining tactics, and the particular setting existing during the contract formation process,\u201d and substantive unconscionability, which generally involves harsh or unfair one-sided terms. <em>See Sitogum Holdings, Inc. v. Ropes, </em>352 <em>N.J.Super. </em>555, 564-66, 800 A.2d 915 (Ch.Div.2002) (quoted with approval in <em>Muhammad v. Cnty. Bank, Rehoboth Beach, </em>189 <em>N.J. </em>1, 15, 912 A.2d 88 (2006), <em>cert, denied, </em>549 <em>U.S. </em>1338, 127 <em>S.Ct. </em>2032, 167 L.Ed.2d 763 (2007)). These two factors do not \u201chave equal effect but work together, creating a \u2018sliding scale\u2019 of unconscionability.\u201d <em>Sitogum, supra, </em>352 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 565-66, 800 A.2d 915 (cited with approval in <em>Delta Funding Corp. v. Harris, </em>189 <em>N.J. </em>28, 40, 912 A.2d 104 (2006)). In concluding that defendant\u2019s unconscionability claim was without merit, the judge did not examine defendant\u2019s factual assertions in light of these principles.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-5\">V</p>\n<p id=\"b129-6\">The order under review is vacated, and the matter remanded for further consideration of defendant\u2019s motion to be relieved of the consequences of his failure to adequately represent himself in conformity with this opinion.
