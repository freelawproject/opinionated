Defendant was twenty-three years old at the time and a lifelong resident of the State of New York. As a mandatory part of this plea agreement, defendant would also be placed on community supervision for life pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6.4.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-8\">Because defendant travelled from New York to this state to engage in these sexual encounters, he was also charged by the United States Attorney\u2019s Office with the federal offense of \u201cCoercion or enticement of a minor female,\u201d in violation of 18 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 2422. Under the plea agreement, the State agreed to recommend that the custodial part of the sentence imposed by the Superior Court should run concurrent with the sentence imposed by the United States District Court of New Jersey.</p>\n<p id=\"b132-9\">On April 23, 2004, the District Court sentenced defendant to serve a term of forty-six months in federal prison. On October 26, 2006, the Superior Court in Somerset County found sufficient grounds to sentence defendant within the third degree range and imposed a term of imprisonment of three years.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Consistent with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>the plea agreement, the court ordered that this sentence run concurrent with the sentence imposed by the federal court. The court also placed defendant on community supervision for life, as provided for in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6.4. Defendant did not file a direct appeal challenging any part of his conviction or sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-6\">Despite some discrepancy in the record,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> the post-conviction relief (PCR) court found defendant timely filed a petition seeking PCR pursuant to <em>Rule </em>3:22-2(a), alleging a denial of his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel. Defendant claims he was compelled to plead guilty without being given sufficient time to review with his attorney the information provided by the court concerning the requirements and ramifications of being placed on community supervision for life under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6.4. The record of the plea hearing reflects the trial judge gave defendant a ten-page document,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> allegedly summarizing the requirements of community supervision for life, and directed defense counsel to review the document with defendant over the court\u2019s one-hour lunch recess.</p>\n<p id=\"b133-7\">Defendant also claims he was denied effective representation of counsel because his attorney did not discuss with him the specific requirements under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6.4 during plea negotiations, including whether, as a New York resident, he would be subject to different or additional restrictions upon completion of his custodial sentence. Defendant submitted a certification in which he attests that he only expected \u201cto submit to the specific registration <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"106\">*106</page-number>guidelines of the particular version of \u2018Megan\u2019s Law<footnotemark>[4]</footnotemark>\u2019 in effect in the state where I would be residing upon my release (New York).\u201d However, his attorney was totally unaware of the restrictions imposed by New York.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-5\">The PCR court denied defendant\u2019s petition without conducting an evidentiary hearing. The court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-6\">It would be overly onerous on both the defense attorney and the Court to be required to advise Petitioner[s] of the community supervision for life provisions applicable in other states on the chance that a Petitioner might choose to reside in that state and was permitted to under the provisions of the New Jersey community supervision for life.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-7\">Defendant now appeals raising the following argument:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-8\">POINT I</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-9\">THE DEFENDANT RECEIVED INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL BECAUSE HE WAS NOT PROPERLY ADVISED REGARDING THE CONSEQUENCES OF COMMUNITY SUPERVISION FOR LIFE, INCLUDING THE ELECTRONIC MONITORING PROGRAM, BEFORE AND DURING HIS PLEA, AND MUST THEREFORE BE ALLOWED TO WITHDRAW HIS PLEA.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-10\">We agree with defendant and reverse. As a threshold issue, defendant was a lifelong New York resident at the time he pled guilty. Thus, the PCR court\u2019s concern about the potential \u201conerous\u201d burden it would place on defense counsel and the trial judge \u201cto be required to advise [a defendant] of the community supervision for life provisions applicable in other states <em>on the chance that a Petitioner might choose to reside in that state\u201d </em>is not an accurate characterization of the salient facts in this ease. (Emphasis added). The record shows that defense counsel, the prosecutor, and the trial judge were all aware that defendant was a lifelong resident of New York, that he expected to return to his home state once he completed the custodial part of his sentence, and that he expressed particular concern about the New York implications of his New Jersey conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"107\">*107</page-number>It is undisputed that at the time of the plea hearing, defense counsel was not aware of New Jersey\u2019s community supervision requirement. It was the trial judge who introduced the topic and made the following prescient statement:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-5\">There\u2019s now a publication coming out from parole to describe what community supervision for life is. So in order to avoid any PCR\u2019s at a later date, indicating I didn\u2019t know what community supervision for life is, and I\u2019m going to give you Tdefense counsel! a copy and you can go over with your client, and I\u2019ll get it on record you\u2019ve reviewed it and that will not be a problem in the future. So I\u2019ll hold this and take care of another ease before we break for lunch.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">The following colloquy took place after the court\u2019s lunch recess:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ArL\">THE COURT: We\u2019re back on the William Smullen case. Let me start off, we already have counsel\u2019s appearance on this. We got you on record on that one. [Defense counsel thereafter re-announces his appearance on behalf of defendant.] THE COURT: And [defense counsel], I take it you\u2019ve had a chance to review with Mr. Smullen what exactly is meant by community supervision for life.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-7\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Yes, I have, your Honor,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-8\">THE COURT: And in fact, the Court has, I believe, given you a ten-page form you\u2019ve received from the Department of Corrections outlining under the Administrative Code section 10A:71-6.11 as to what is community supervision for life. And you\u2019ve reviewed that with your client?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-9\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: Yes, we\u2019ve reviewed it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-10\">THE COURT: Is that so, Mr. Smullen, you\u2019ve reviewed that community supervision for life provision?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-11\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes, I did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-12\">THE COURT: You understand it completely?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-13\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes, I do.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-14\">THE COURT: And you want to proceed with the sentence?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-15\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-16\">THE COURT: And it may [a]ffect where you live, do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-17\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-18\">THE COURT: There\u2019s a provision in there about supervision by the Department of Corrections in New Jersey; do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-19\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-20\">THE COURT: And you want to go ahead with the plea bargain anyway?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-21\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes, I do. One question, my residence is in New York. THE COURT: Well, it has a provision in there about their supervision about where you live. It may not be at your discretion, it may be at their discretion. So yeah, it may [ajffect, yes, it may [a]ffect your ability to live in New York. THE COURT: What do you want to do? You want to continue to live in New York or not? As I sit here today, I have no idea what they\u2019re going to say, I just <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"108\">*108</page-number>want to make sure you understand you run the risk if they decide you have to stay in New Jersey, you have to stay in New Jersey where they can watch you more</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-6\">closely, do you understand that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-7\">THE DEPENDANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-8\">THE COURT: But understanding that you want to go ahead with the plea?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-9\">THE DEPENDANT: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-10\">THE COURT: [Addressing defense counsel] Anything else counsel?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b136-11\">[DEFENSE COUNSEL]: I don\u2019t believe so, your Honor.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-12\">In support of his PCR petition, defendant certified that during the lunch recess his attorney requested the prosecutor to agree \u201cto a postponement, of at least one day, to allow me to have additional time to adequately review and consider [the community supervision for life] conditions, as well as the implications attendant to them.\u201d According to defendant, his counsel said the prosecutor \u201crebuffed this request and stated that his office would immediately withdraw the 5-year flat<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> offer, and increase it to a \u20187-year flat\u2019 offer if [defendant] did not enter my guilty plea that afternoon.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b136-13\">We review a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel under the two-prong test established by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 <em>U.S. </em>668,104 <em>S.Ct. </em>2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), and subsequently adopted by our Supreme Court in <em>State v. Fritz, </em>105 <em>N.J. </em>42, 58, 519 A.2d 336 (1987). First, defendant must demonstrate that defense counsel\u2019s performance was deficient. <em>Strickland, supra, </em>466 <em>U.S. </em>at 687, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d at 693. Second, he must show there exists \u201ca reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 694,104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2068, 80 L.Ed.2d at 698.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-14\">In determining a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in a case in which a defendant pled guilty, \u201cthe issue is whether it is ineffective assistance of counsel for counsel to provide mis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"109\">*109</page-number>leading, material information that results in an uninformed plea, and whether that occurred here.\u201d <em>State v. Nunez-Valdez, </em>200 <em>N.J. </em>129, 139-40, 975 A.2d 418 (2009). Community supervision for life under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6.4 has long been considered a punitive consequence of a criminal sentence. <em>State v. Schubert, </em>212 <em>N.J. </em>295, 308, 53 A.3d 1210 (2012) (citing <em>State ex rel. B.P.C., </em>421 <em>N.J.Super. </em>329, 354, 23 A.3d 937 (App.Div.2011); <em>State v. Jamgochian, </em>363 <em>N.J.Super. </em>220, 224, 832 A.2d 360 (App.Div.2003)). A defendant pleading guilty to an offense triggering the requirements of community supervision for life is entitled to expect his attorney to provide him with complete and accurate information concerning the ramifications of this material aspect of a plea agreement. <em>State v. Agathis, </em>424 <em>N.J.Super. </em>16, 23, 34 A.3d 1266 (App.Div.2012).</p>\n<p id=\"b137-6\">Based on the evidence presented before the PCR court, defendant established a prima facie case of ineffective assistance of counsel and was therefore entitled to an evidentiary hearing pursuant to <em>Rule </em>3:22-10(b). <em>State v. Preciose, </em>129 <em>N.J. </em>451, 462-63, 609 A.2d 1280 (1992). Defense counsel was entirely uninformed at the plea hearing about the particular requirements of community supervision for life. But for the trial court\u2019s impromptu intervention, this issue would have been completely unaddressed. The court\u2019s attempt to cure this deficiency by giving defense counsel a one-hour lunch recess to familiarize himself with these requirements, and thereafter provide meaningful, professionally sound advice to defendant on the implications of the community supervision for life requirements, was patently inadequate.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\">Even more relevant from defendant\u2019s perspective, neither the court nor his attorney provided him with any information about how these restrictions would apply in his home state of New York. We expect a reasonably competent New Jersey attorney to be able to research New York law and make at least a preliminary determination of his or her ability to advise a client about the New York ramifications of pleading guilty to a crime in New Jersey. If <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"110\">*110</page-number>after researching New York law, counsel believes he or she is not competent to offer professionally sound advice to the client, then it is counsel\u2019s responsibility to consult with, or refer the client to, an attorney who can do so. Leaving the client uninformed about this vital aspect of his decision to accept or reject the State\u2019s plea offer is not an option.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">In the interest of clarity, we emphasize that defense counsel\u2019s subpar legal performance here satisfies the first prong under <em>Strickland, supra, </em>466 <em>U.S. </em>at 687,104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2064, 80 L.Ed.2d at 693, and falls within the paradigm articulated by the Court in <em>Nunez-Valdez, supra, </em>200 <em>N.J. </em>at 138, 975 A.2d 418. Counsel should have been aware of the penal consequences defendant was facing under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6.4, as well as how they would affect defendant as a New York resident, before engaging in plea negotiations with the State. This is not a case involving the retroactive application of a new rule of law. <em>Cf. Chaidez v. United States, </em>568 <em>U.S. </em>-, 133 <em>S.Ct. </em>1103, 185 L.Ed.2d 149 (2013); <em>State v. Gaitan, </em>209 <em>N.J. </em>339, 37 A.3d 1089 (2012), <em>cert, de</em>nied, \u2014 <em>U.S. </em>-, 133 <em>S.Ct. </em>1454, 185 L.Ed.2d 361 (2013).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-8\">We thus remand this matter for the PCR judge to determine whether \u201c \u2018there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, [the defendant] would not have pled guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.\u2019 \u201d <em>Nunez-Valdez, supra, </em>200 <em>N.J. </em>at 138, 975 A.2d 418 (quoting <em>State v. DiFrisco, </em>137 <em>N.J. </em>434, 457, 645 A.2d 734 (1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b132-10\"> Because defendant pled guilty to a second degree offense, he was subject to a term of imprisonment of between five to ten years. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6a(2). Exercising the discretionary authority conferred in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44 \u2014 1f(2), which requires the court to find the mitigating factors preponderate over the aggravating factors, <em>State v. Balfour, </em>135 <em>N.J. </em>30, 35, 637 A.2d 1249 (1994), the judge decided to sentence defendant to a degree lower, within a range of no less than three nor more than five years of imprisonment. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-6a(3).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b133-8\"> Appellate counsel indicates in his brief before us that defendant filed this PCR petition on May 4, 2012. Citing the time restrictions in <em>Rule </em>3:22-12(a)(l), the PCR court specifically found defendant\u2019s petition was timely \"because the Petitioner was sentenced on October 26, 2006 and filed his Petition for Post-Conviction Relief on or about September 27, 2011, just before the five year statute of limitations ran.\u201d The State does not dispute the PCR court's findings in this respect.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b133-9\"> Defendant did not produce this ten-page document in support of his PCR petition, and neither the prosecutor nor the court have a copy of it in their files.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[4]\">\n<p id=\"b134-11\">4 Although not an issue in this case, we pause to note the common misconception of referring to community supervision for life under <em>NJ.S.A. </em>2C:43-6.4 as a \"Megan's Law\" requirement. The requirements imposed under what is commonly referred to as \"Megan's Law\u201d are codified under <em>NJ.S.A. </em>2C:7-1 to -19.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b136-15\"> The term \"flat,\" in the context of a custodial state prison term, is a colloquialism used by lawyers for a term of imprisonment without any minimum mandatory term of parole ineligibility.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
