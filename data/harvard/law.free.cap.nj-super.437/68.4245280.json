McNeely, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>-, 133 <em>S.Ct. </em>1552, 185 <em>L.Ed. </em>2d 696 (2013), a warrantless blood test was administered to a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>driver arrested for driving while intoxicated after a routine traffic stop. There being no other facts to suggest an emergency existed, the United States Supreme Court was asked to decide the broad question \u201cwhether the natural metabolization of alcohol in the bloodstream presents a per <em>se exigency </em>that justifies an exception to the Fourth Amendment\u2019s warrant requirement for nonconsensual blood testing <em>in all drunk-driving cases.\u201d Id. </em>at -, 133 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1556, 185 L.Ed.2d at 702 (emphasis added). Concluding that fact alone did not present a <em>\u201cper se </em>exigency,\u201d the Supreme Court held, \u201cconsistent with general Fourth Amendment principles, that exigency in this context must be determined case by ease based on the totality of the circumstances.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">Prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision, defendant caused a multiple vehicle accident, resulting in personal injury to herself and another that required each of them to be transported to a hospital. It took emergency personnel approximately thirty minutes to extricate the unconscious defendant from her vehicle. The police investigation of the accident scene at a heavily traveled intersection took several hours. Relying on <em>McNeely, </em>the trial court suppressed a blood alcohol content (BAC) reading of .345, the result of a blood test administered without a warrant. We granted leave to the State to appeal from this order and, for the reasons that follow, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">Defendant was indicted on one count of fourth-degree assault by auto, <em>N.J.S.A </em>2C:12-l(c)(2), and was issued related summonses for reckless driving, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-96, and driving while intoxicated, <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:4-50. She filed a motion to suppress the results of the blood sample.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-10\">Two witnesses testified at the suppression hearing, Officers James Watts and Anthony Sorrentino of the Cherry Hill Police Department. The facts elicited at the suppression hearing can be summarized as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b99-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>It was dusk at approximately 7:00 p.m. on December 28, 2011, when a three-vehicle crash occurred at the intersection of Kings Highway, a State highway, and Church Road, a county road in Cherry Hill. Traffic at this location is heavy during rush hour conditions. Two automobiles were stopped at a red light on Kings Highway. Defendant drove her vehicle into the second car stopped at the light, propelling it into the automobile ahead of it. Defendant\u2019s vehicle continued to strike the second vehicle before \u201ccareening off\u2019 across the intersection, where it wedged up against a cemetery archway. Because the accident involved injuries, it was a \u201cCode 2\u201d crash in which available police units are dispatched to the scene. In addition to the eleven officers who responded, there were at least two Emergency Medical Service (EMS) vehicles and four EMS personnel, two fire trucks and an unknown number of firefighters at the accident scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">Officer Sorrentino was one of the first officers on the scene, which he described as \u201cvery chaotic.\u201d Officers Watts and Sorren-tino described the officers\u2019 tasks at the scene. Officer Sorrentino stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b99-6\">[WJhen we first responded we had to set up traffic directions so we had to block off the vehicles that were damaged. And we had to set up a system for directing traffic around the damaged vehicles as well as the emergency vehicles. Someone had to attend to the victims in each car and other units would have attended to any witnesses or tried to locate any witnesses at the scene.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">Several officers were needed to assess the traffic conditions, the occupants of the three vehicles, and the situation involving defendant\u2019s car. There was a concern that the building defendant had struck might collapse. Watts described the officers\u2019 objective as \u201cto make sure ... that there\u2019s nothing else going to happen to make the scene worse.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">Defendant was found inside her vehicle, unconscious and bleeding from her face. The fire department and Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) had to extricate her from her heavily damaged car, a process that took approximately one-half hour. As defendant was being removed from the vehicle and placed in the ambulance, the EMTs told Officer Sorrentino that there was an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>odor of alcohol on defendant\u2019s breath. Because defendant remained unconscious, no sobriety tests were administered at the scene. Defendant was taken to the hospital along with an occupant of one of the other cars who was also injured in the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-6\">Officer Watts, a traffic safety officer, testified that his assignment is to investigate what are deemed to be potentially serious or fatal accidents. He was called to investigate the scene approximately forty-five minutes to one hour after the accident was reported, arriving after defendant had been taken to the hospital. He testified it took several hours for the investigation at the scene to be completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-7\">Officer Sorrentino went to the hospital to follow up on the injuries of defendant and the occupant of the other vehicle, which proved not to be serious. Once defendant regained consciousness, Officer Sorrentino asked her if she had anything to drink and she responded that she had at least one beverage. The record does not reveal for how long defendant was unconscious. Officer Sorrentino described defendant\u2019s speech as \u201cvery slurred.\u201d She was unable to answer his questions when he asked for her address or for a phone contact for a relative.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-8\">At Officer Sorrentino\u2019s request, a nurse drew defendant\u2019s blood at approximately 8:15 p.m. The blood test revealed a BAC reading of .345.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, the blood was drawn approximately one hour and fifteen minutes after police responded to the automobile accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-9\">Officer Sorrentino testified that, pursuant to standard operating procedures at the time, he was not required to obtain a search warrant. He testified further that he did not receive his first training in securing telephone warrants until after the accident. Both Watts and Sorrentino testified that, to their knowledge, telephone warrants were not available in their jurisdiction in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>December 2011.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As of the time of the suppression hearing, neither had obtained a telephone warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">The suppression hearing in this case was conducted approximately four months after <em>McNeely </em>was decided. Citing our Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>State v. Wessells, </em>209 <em>N.J. </em>395, 411-12, 37 A.3d 1122 (2012), the motion judge observed that <em>McNeely </em>applied to all cases that were not yet final because the decision implicated rights guaranteed under the federal Constitution. The motion judge described the applicable rule as requiring a warrant for a blood sample unless an exception to the warrant requirement, such as an exigency, applies. He stated,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-7\">[T]he rule in both <em>McNeely </em>and <em>Schmerber [v. California, </em>384 <em>U.S. </em>757, 771-72, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>1826, 1836, 16 L.Ed.2d 908, 920 (1966) ] is that a warrantless blood draw may be taken from drunk driving suspects based on the exigency of the dissipation of blood alcohol evidence where the totality of the circumstances indicates that the officer did not have time to obtain a warrant. The Court in <em>Schmerber </em>found an exigency to exist while the Court in <em>McNeely </em>affirmed the Missouri Supreme Court decision finding none.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-8\">The motion judge found both Sorrentino and the other police witness to be \u201cgenuinely credible,\u201d and \u201cacted probably in good faith,\u201d which included \u201cask[ing] the hospital personnel to use a kit to do a blood draw of the suspect\u201d instead of seeking a search warrant. He also recognized that while telephonic warrants were available, it was not the general practice to use them.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">The motion judge found that the officers had a sufficient legal basis to seek a search warrant when the EMT alerted them to the odor of alcohol on defendant in light of the circumstances of the accident. The judge acknowledged eleven police officers were required in addition to the emergency personnel at the accident scene and that the officers had \u201cduties to attend to of great importance at the scene and were attending to them.\u201d However, the motion judge concluded that the State had not established that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>under all the circumstances of this case, this three-car accident with one serious injury and one minor injury, was such that all the attention of all the police officers the entire time they were all there was required to attend to duties at the scene such that <em>it would ham been impossible for any one of them to have had the time to call for a search warrant telephonicatty.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b102-5\">[Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">The motion judge also stated that, although <em>McNeely </em>and the caselaw generally discuss the natural metabolization of alcohol in the bloodstream, he had <em>no </em>evidence before him that showed</p>\n<blockquote id=\"At\">in any kind of detail as to precisely what that problem is, precisely how quickly alcohol tends to metabolize, what the time frame is within which the alcohol test must have been conducted relative to the last time the person ingested alcohol for some sort of reasonably fair reading to be obtained.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b102-7\">Accordingly, defendant\u2019s motion to suppress was granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">In this appeal, the State argues that the motion judge erred in applying <em>McNeely </em>\u201cretroactively\u201d and in failing to find an ejdgency in the circumstances here. Defendant does not dispute that the procedure here would have passed muster under the applicable New Jersey precedents. Instead, she contends that New Jersey precedent constituted \u201cbad law,\u201d premised upon a misreading of <em>Schmerber. </em>She submits that the motion judge was correct in applying <em>McNeely </em>to this case and in concluding there was no <em>exigency to excuse </em>the failure <em>to </em>obtain a warrant.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-9\">In reviewing the denial of a motion to suppress, this court \u201cmust uphold the factual findings underlying the trial court\u2019s decision so long as\u201d there is sufficient and credible support in the record. <em>State v. Elders, </em>192 <em>N.J. </em>224, 243, 927 A.2d 1250 (2007). The trial court\u2019s legal conclusions, however, are not entitled to the same deference \u2014 \u201cappellate review of legal determinations is plenary.\u201d <em>State v. Handy, </em>206 <em>N.J. </em>39, 45,18 A.3d 179 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b102-10\">In this case, the motion judge concluded that the blood test results had to be suppressed because the State failed to show \u201cit would have been impossible\u201d to obtain a warrant. In addition, he criticized the lack of precise information regarding the elimination rate for defendant\u2019s BAC and questioned the allocation of police resources at the scene of the accident. We conclude that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>judge erred in his application of the standard required by <em>McNeely </em>and <em>Schmerber </em>and that the blood test results should not have been suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">In 2011, New Jersey law permitted the police to obtain a blood sample without first obtaining a warrant, so long as they had probable cause to believe that the driver was intoxicated and the sample was taken \u201cin a medically acceptable manner at a hospital or other suitable health care facility,\u201d <em>State v. Dyal, </em>97 <em>N.J. </em>229, 238, 478 A.2d 390 (1984) (citing <em>Schmerber, supra, </em>384 <em>U.S. </em>at 771-72, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1836, 16 L.Ed.2d at 920), and without the use of excessive force. <em>State v. Ravotto, </em>169 <em>N.J. </em>227, 231-33, 777 A.2d 301 (2001); <em>see also State v. Adkins, </em>433 <em>N.J.Super. </em>479, 482-84, 81 A.3d 680 (App.Div.2013), <em>certif. granted, </em>217 <em>N.J. </em>588, 91 A.3d 24 (2014).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">The following passage in <em>Schmerber </em>provided guidance for our decisions:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-9\">[T]he questions we must decide in this case are whether the police were justified in requiring petitioner to submit to the blood test, and whether the means and procedures employed in taking his blood respected relevant Fourth Amendment standards of reasonableness.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-10\">In this case, as will often be true when charges of driving under the influence of alcohol are pressed, these questions arise in the context of an arrest made by an officer without a warrant. Here, there was plainly probable cause for the officer to arrest petitioner and charge him with driving an automobile while under the influence of intoxicating liquor. The police officer who arrived at the scene shortly after the accident smelled liquor on petitioner\u2019s breath, and testified that petitioner\u2019s eyes were \u201cbloodshot, watery, sort of a glassy appearance.\u201d The officer saw petitioner again at the hospital, <em>within two hours of the </em>accident____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b103-11\">Although the facts which established probable cause to arrest in this case also suggested the required relevance and likely success of a test of petitioner\u2019s blood for alcohol, the question remains whether the arresting officer was permitted to draw these inferences himself, or was required instead to procure a warrant before proceeding with the test. Search warrants are ordinarily required for searches of dwellings, and, absent an emergency, no less could be required where intrusions into the human body are concerned____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>The officer in the present case, however, <em>might reasonably have believed that he was confronted with an emergency, in which the delay necessary to obtain a warrant, under the circumstances, threatened \u201cthe destruction of emdencef.J </em>\u201d We are told that the percentage of alcohol in the blood begins to diminish shortly after drinking stops, as the body functions to eliminate it from the system. <em>Particularly in a case such as this, where time had to be taken to bring the accused to a hospital and to investigate the scene of the accident, there was no time to seek out a magistrate and secure a warrant </em>Given <em>these special facts, </em>we conclude that the attempt to secure evidence of blood-alcohol content in this case was an appropriate incident to petitioner\u2019s arrest.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-5\"><em>[Schmerber, supra, </em>384 <em>U.S. </em>at 768-771, 86 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1834-36, 16 L.Ed.2d at 918-20 (emphasis added) (internal citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-6\">In <em>Dyal, supra, </em>our Supreme Court described the \u201ccrucial consideration\u201d in this reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-7\">[T]he body eliminates alcohol at a rapid rate. The evidence is evanescent and may disappear in a few hours. Investigating police, while coping with an emergency, should not be obliged to obtain a search warrant before seeking an involuntary blood test of a suspected drunken driver.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b104-8\">[97 <em>N.J. </em>at 239-40, 478 A.2d 390 (citing <em>Schmerber, </em>384 <em>U.S. </em>at 770-71, 86 <em>S.Ct </em>at 1836,16 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 919-20).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b104-9\">Our courts did not stand alone in this interpretation of <em>Schmer-ber. </em>The Supreme Court noted that it was deciding <em>McNeely </em>to resolve a split in federal authority on this issue. <em>Id. </em>at-, 133 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1558, 185 L.Ed.2d at 703; <em>see also </em>3 Wayne R. LaFave, <em>Search and Seizure, A Treatise on the Fourth Amendment, </em>\u00a7 5.4(b) (5th ed.2012) and cases cited therein.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-12\">It is an ineluctable conclusion that, at the time Officer Sorrenti-no requested a blood sample, he had probable cause to believe that defendant had been driving while intoxicated. The parties stipulated that the blood sample was obtained in a medically acceptable manner. It would therefore appear that the blood sample procedure here complied with New Jersey law at the time of the accident and defendant has not argued to the contrary.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-13\">We note further that, if the ruling in <em>McNeely </em>had come from our Supreme Court based upon the protections afforded by the New Jersey Constitution, the ruling would have marked a clear departure from New Jersey precedent that would have been limited to prospective application. <em>See State v. Cummings, </em>184 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number><em>N.J. </em>84, 96-99, 875 A.2d 906 (2005); <em>see also Adkins, supra, </em>433 <em>N. J.Super. </em>at 486, 81 A.3d 680.</p>\n<p id=\"b105-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b105-7\">Since <em>McNeely </em>is rooted in the Supreme Court\u2019s interpretation of federal constitutional law, its application here is governed by the well-established principle that \u201ca new rule for the conduct of criminal prosecutions is to be applied retroactively to all cases, state or federal, pending on direct review or not yet final, with no exception for cases in which the new rule constitutes a \u2018clear break\u2019 with the past.\u201d <em>Wessells, supra, </em>209 <em>N.J. </em>at 412, 37 A.3d 1122 (quoting <em>Griffith v. Kentucky, </em>479 <em>U.S. </em>314, 328, 107 <em>S.Ct. </em>708, 716, 93 L.Ed.2d 649, 661 (1987)). Citing <em>Wessells, </em>defendant argues and the motion judge found that <em>McNeely </em>must be given \u201cretroactive\u201d application,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> a conclusion rejected by another part of this court.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> For the purposes of our analysis here, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>however, we need not determine whether <em>McNeely </em>should be applied retroactively because we conclude that the application of <em>McNeely </em>to the facts of this case does not require the suppression of the results of defendant\u2019s blood test.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">The fact that the Supreme Court rejected a <em>per se </em>exigency rule in <em>McNeely </em>should not be misinterpreted as a retreat from its recognition that the dissipation of alcohol in the blood merits considerable weight in a totality of the circumstances analysis. It must be emphasized that both the Missouri Supreme Court and the United States Supreme Court described the facts in <em>McNeely </em>as \u201c \u2018unquestionably a routine DWI case\u2019 in which no factors other than the natural dissipation of blood-alcohol suggested that there was an emergency.\u201d <em>McNeely, supra, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>at-, 133 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1557,185 L.Ed.2d at 703 (quoting <em>State v. McNeely, </em>358 S.W.3d 65, 74 (Mo.2012)). There was no accident; no injured defendant who needed to be extricated from her heavily damaged car; no other injured person who had to be transported to the hospital; no concentration of disabled cars and emergency vehicles at a busy intersection; and no police investigation beyond the DWI arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-8\">Still, the Supreme Court accepted as \u201ctrue\u201d the immutable fact that the alcohol level in one\u2019s bloodstream begins to dissipate from the time \u201cthe alcohol is fully absorbed and continues to decline until the alcohol is eliminated.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 133 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1560, 185 L.Ed.2d at 706. It is through this lens that the Supreme Court assessed the totality of the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-11\">The Supreme Court discounted the significance of the \u201cexact elimination rate,\u201d finding it \u201csufficient\u201d to note that \u201cbecause an individual\u2019s alcohol level gradually declines soon after he stops drinking, <em>a significant delay in testing will negatively affect the probative value of the results.\u201d Id. </em>at-, 133 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1560-61, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>185 L.Ed.2d at 707 (emphasis added).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Court emphasized this point, stating,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-6\">This fact was <em>essential </em>to our holding in <em>Schmerber, </em>as we recognized that, under the circumstances, <em>further delay </em>in order to secure a warrant <em>after the time spent investigating the scene of the accident and transporting the injured suspect to the hospital </em>to receive treatment <em>would have threatened </em>the destruction of evidence. <em>[Id. </em>at-, 133 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1561,185 L.Bd.2d at 707 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-7\">The salient points to be made here are that the dissipation of blood alcohol continues to be an \u201cessential\u201d factor in analyzing the totality of the circumstances; that time spent investigating an accident and transporting an injured suspect to the hospital causes delay; that obtaining a warrant will result in further delay<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and that such additional delay will \u201cthreaten\u201d the destruction of evidence. The Supreme Court did not require the State to show that the \u201cfurther delay\u201d would substantially impair the probative value of a blood sample drawn after a warrant was obtained or that it was impossible to obtain a warrant before the evidence was dissipated. In short, the Court did not require proof that evidence would be destroyed; it was sufficient to show that delays \u201cthreatened\u201d its destruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">It is therefore clear that the motion judge applied a more stringent test than that required by <em>McNeely. </em>The judge interpreted <em>McNeely </em>to mean that an exigency is limited to circumstances where there is no time to obtain a warrant. This very <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>standard was advocated by Chief Justice Roberts in his partial dissent. He would have established the following rule:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-5\">If there is time to secure a warrant before blood can be drawn, the police must seek one. If an officer could reasonably conclude that there is not sufficient time to seek and receive a warrant, or he applies for one but does not receive a response before blood can be drawn, a warrantless blood draw may ensue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqH\"><em>[McNeely, supra, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>at-, 133 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1573, 185 L.Ed.2d at 720 (Roberts, C.J., concurring and dissenting).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-8\">The Supreme Court explicitly declined to adopt the Chief Justice\u2019s \u201cmodified <em>per se </em>rule,\u201d favoring instead the \u201ctraditional totality of the circumstances analysis.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 133 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1563,185 L.Ed.2d at 710. Of particular importance to an analysis of the facts here, <em>McNeely </em>described the special facts considered in the <em>Schmerber </em>Court\u2019s analysis which, the Court agreed, were sufficient to support a warrantless blood test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-11\">[T]he petitioner had suffered <em>injuiies in an automobile accident </em>and was <em>taken to the hospital. </em>While he was there receiving treatment, a police officer arrested the petitioner for driving while under the influence of alcohol and ordered a blood test over his objection____ [W]e concluded that the warrantless blood test \"in the present case\u201d was nonetheless permissible because the officer <em>\u201cmight reasonably have believed that he was confronted with an emergency, </em>in which the delay necessary to obtain a warrant, under the circumstances, <em>threatened \u2018the destruction of evidence.\u2019 \u201d</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-14\">In support of that conclusion, we observed that evidence could have been lost because \u201cthe percentage of alcohol in the blood begins to diminish shortly after drinking stops, as the body functions to eliminate it from the system.\u201d We added that \u201c[p]artieularly in a case such as this, <em>where time had to be taken to bring the accused to a hospital and to investigate the seme of the accident, there was no time to seek out a magistrate and secure a warrant\u2019\u2019 </em>\u201cGiven these special facte,\u201d we found that it was appropriate for the police to act without a warrant.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b108-15\"><em>[McNeely, supra, </em>\u2014 <em>U.S. </em>at-, 133 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1559-60, 185 <em>L.Ed.2A </em>at 705-06 (emphasis added) (internal citations omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b108-17\">The Court described the analysis in <em>Schmerber </em>as \u201cfit[ting] comfortably within our ease law applying the exigent circumstances exception.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 133 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1560, 185 L.Ed.2d at 706.

Therefore, it was not necessary for the officers to shoulder the further delay entailed in securing a warrant that would have threatened the destruction of the blood alcohol evidence. Defendant\u2019s suppression motion should have been denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b109-6\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b100-10\"> The penalties for driving while intoxicated apply to persons who operate a motor vehicle with a BAC of 0.08% or higher. <em>NJ.S.A. </em>39:4-50.

In that case, the United States Supreme Court established fourteen days as \u201ca break in custody that is of sufficient duration to dissipate its coercive effects\" for renewed interrogation of a suspect who initially requested counsel. <em>Shatzer, supra, </em>559 <em>U.S, </em>at 109, 130 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1222, 175 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 1056. After reviewing the history of pertinent precedent, the Court observed that <em>Shatzer </em>represented a \u201crejection of a totality of the circumstances approach in favor of a single time period,\u201d and that the United States Supreme Court\u2019s \"language of certainty\" was intended to \u201cavoid debate\" by creating a bright line rule. <em>Wessells, supra, </em>209 <em>N.J. </em>at 410, 37 A.3d 1122. In contrast to <em>Shatzer, McNeely </em>did not establish a bright line rule but rather, adhered to a totality of the circumstances approach to the resolution of challenges to warrantless blood samples taken from suspected drunk drivers. <em>See McNeely, supra, </em>- <em>U.S. </em>at-, -, 133 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 1559, 1563-64, 185 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 705, 709-10.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b105-11\"> In <em>Adkins, </em>we observed that \u201cthe United States Supreme Court will not apply the exclusionary rule as a remedy where the police conducted a search in good faith reliance on binding legal precedent in the jurisdiction where the search occurred,\u201d and that the Court had clarified that retroactive application is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"78\">*78</page-number>mandated by a new rule of substantive Fourth Amendment law. <em>Id. </em>at 484-85, 81 A.3d 680 (\"[T]he retroactive application of a new rule of substantive Fourth Amendment law <em>raises </em>the question whether a suppression remedy applies; it does not answer that question.\") (quoting <em>Davis v.

Since many of these facts, as well as the time a suspect ceased drinking alcohol, are unlikely to be known to officers arriving at an accident scene, the Court\u2019s dismissal of any need to prove an \"exact elimination rate\u201d is a practical approach to the analysis.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b107-12\"> Recognizing that some delay is inevitable, even in a telephone warrant situation, the Court stated, \"We by no means claim that telecommunications innovations have, will, or should eliminate all delay from the warrant-application process.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at-, 133 <em>S.Ct. at </em>1562, 185 <em>L.Ed.ld </em>at 709.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
