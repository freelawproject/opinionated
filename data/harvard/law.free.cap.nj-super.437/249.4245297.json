(Dobco) appeals from a September 19, 2012 final judgment denying its motion for partial summary judgment against Colonial Surety Company (Colonial), surety for J. Strober &amp; Sons, LLC (Strober), Dobco\u2019s subcontractor, and granting Colonial\u2019s motion for summary judgment dismissing Dobco\u2019s cross-claims<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> against Colonial. The Law Division dismissed Dobco\u2019s claims against Colonial under the bond on the ground that the bond did not name Dobco as the obligee and because Dobco had rejected the bond as not in the form required by its subcontract with Strober. We deem neither of those facts material because we conclude that in entering into its surety contract with Strober, Colonial obligated itself to issue a performance bond to Dobco in the form annexed to the Dob-co/Strober subcontract. Accordingly, we reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">The facts adduced on the motions establish that Dobco was the general contractor to The William Patterson University (WPU) for a project referred to as the \u201cScience Hall Addition, Renovation, and Greenhouse.\u201d Strober bid for and was awarded a subcontract for the roofing work. Dobco and Strober entered into a standard AIA (\u201cAmerican Institute of Architects\u201d) form of agreement on November 11, 2008. The agreement required Strober to furnish performance and payment bonds in the amount of $890,000, in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"254\">*254</page-number>forms annexed to the agreement, prior to commencing work.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Strober applied to Colonial, the surety that had furnished Stro-ber\u2019s bid bond for the project, for its performance bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">Colonial is a Pennsylvania company, licensed in New Jersey as a property and casualty insurer. The company specializes in contract surety and fidelity. By its president\u2019s account, Colonial does not \u201cwrite business\u201d in the way other insurers do. Upon establishing a \u201cpartnership account\u201d with Colonial, a contractor is provided a \u201cline of surety\u201d with single and aggregate limits, a power of attorney and Colonial\u2019s seal. When the contractor wants to obtain a bid bond for a project, it uses its partnership account code to log into Colonial\u2019s website, inputs the project information and prints out the bond and consent of surety. The contractor signs the documents on behalf of Colonial using its power of attorney, applies Colonial\u2019s seal and submits the bond and consent of surety with its bid.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">If the contractor wins the contract, it updates the online information provided previously and requests issuance of the performance bond. Colonial then has one of its bond administrators make inquiries regarding the bid spreads between the top few bidders, the identity of the architect and the engineer\u2019s estimate.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"255\">*255</page-number>package is then submitted to Colonial\u2019s underwriter for his approval. Significantly, however, Colonial does not request or review the actual contract prior to issuing a performance bond. Colonial\u2019s president testified at deposition that Colonial\u2019s \u201cgeneral policy is not to request a copy of the contract.\u201d When asked why, the president responded \u201cGeneral \u2014 just don\u2019t. Never do.\u201d When asked how Colonial \u201cwould ... verify that it is bonding the correct contract, if it never reviews the contract\u201d prior to issuing the performance bond, the president responded \u201c[vjerification, in my opinion, is not necessary. That\u2019s why we don\u2019t review the contract.\u201d Colonial did not review the Strober subcontract before issuing the performance bond at issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">The parties agree that Strober submitted a bid bond for the project through Colonial\u2019s online system and that Colonial followed its usual procedures in issuing the performance bond on February 26, 2009. The bond provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-7\">That <em>J Strober &amp; Sons, LLC, Ringoes, NJ as </em>Principal, hereinafter called Contractor, and COLONIAL SURETY COMPANY a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, as Surety, hereinafter called Surety, are held and firmly bound unto</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AgE\"><em>William Patterson University, Wayne, NJ 07470 </em>as Obligee, hereinafter called the Owner, in the amount of <em>Eight Hundred Ninety Thousand Dollars and No Cents Dollars ($890,000), </em>for the payment whereof Contractor and Surety bind themselves, their heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, jointly and severally, firmly by these presents.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-8\">WHEREAS, Principal has by written agreement dated <em>November 11, 2008, </em>entered into a contract with the Owner for Science Hall Addition to William Patterson University!.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-9\">In accordance with drawings and specifications prepared by (here insert full name, title and address) Hellmuth, Obata &amp; Kassabaum, 620 Avenue of the Americas, 6th Floor, New York, N.Y. 10011 which contract is by reference made a part hereof, and is hereinafter referred to as the Contract.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b283-10\">NOW THEREFORE, THE CONDITION OF THIS OBLIGATION is such that if Contractor shall promptly and faithfully perform said Contract, then this obligation shall be null and void; otherwise it shall remain in full force and effect.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b283-11\">While the bond bears the correct date of the Dobco/Strober subcontract, it misidentifies the obligee as WPU, the owner, instead of Dobco, WPU\u2019s general contractor and the party to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"256\">*256</page-number>whom Strober promised the bond in the November 11, 2008 written agreement. Strober paid Colonial the full $16,350 premium for the performance bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-4\">Following Strober\u2019s delivery of the bond and accompanying documents to Dobco, Dobco wrote the following memorandum to Strober.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-5\">We are in receipt of the performance and payment bond # CSC-216974 dated February 26, 2009.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-6\">As identified in the AIA A401 Standard Form of Agreement Between Contractor and Subcontractor dated November 11, 2008, we required the performance and payment bond to be issued on a specific form. The performance and payment bonds we received do not comply with that requirement. Please re-issue the performance and payment bond on those forms. A copy of the forms are attached \u25a0 with this memorandum. Please provide the re-issued performance and payment bond no later than March 16,2009. Thank you for your cooperation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">The parties dispute whether Dobco returned the performance bond to Strober. Dobco maintains that it retains the bond in its possession. Strober, which is not a party to this appeal, maintains that Dobco returned the bond and that it, in turn, returned the bond to Colonial. Colonial denies that the original bond was ever returned to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">Upon receipt of Dobco\u2019s memorandum, Strober, using Colonial\u2019s power of attorney and seal, executed performance and payment bonds on Dobco\u2019s forms and telefaxed a copy to Dobco. Colonial contends this second set of bonds is a nullity as its agreement with Strober limited Strober to issuing bid bonds on Colonial\u2019s behalf. Upon receiving the second set of bonds, Dobco sent Strober the following memorandum.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-9\">We are in receipt of the revised performance and payment bond # CSC-216974 dated February 26, 2009. A copy of which is attached.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-10\">The revised performance and payment bond is not acceptable. The performance and payment bond must be revised and issued by Colonial Surety Company with accompanying Surety Disclosure Statement and Certification, General Power of Attorney, and Financial Statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b284-11\">Please provide the re-issued performance and payment bond no later than March 18, 2009. A failure to provide this requirement by that day may delay the process of any payments to your company. Thank you for your cooperation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b284-12\">Strober did not provide revised bonds to Dobco but delivered material to the project site in April and began work in May. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"257\">*257</page-number>early May, Dobco personnel complained to Strober about its work and noted that Strober had yet to respond to its request that Colonial reissue the bonds. Strober, in turn, asked Colonial to reissue the bonds on Dobco\u2019s forms. Colonial, however, had become aware that Strober was experiencing financial difficulties and instead asked for updated financial information from Strober.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-4\">Strober continued to prod Colonial for revised bonds and was several times advised by Colonial that \u201cit is in underwriting,\u201d notwithstanding that Colonial had already issued the bond and Strober had already paid for it. The record contains evidence of several exchanges between Strober and Colonial regarding the subcontract\u2019s requirement that the bonds be issued on Dobco\u2019s form, Colonial\u2019s underwriter\u2019s discomfort with Dobco\u2019s form and his suggestion that Strober approach Dobco with other bond forms, the strength of Strober\u2019s finances and whether Colonial was willing to continue to bond the company going forward.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">On July 21, Strober advised Dobco that \u201c[w]e will ... be forwarding the bond.\u201d On July 24, Strober wrote to the underwriter at Colonial asking that he \u201cconfirm the status of our William Patterson Bond.\u201d Strober wrote that \u201c[w]e received it, paid for it, but had to send the original back to have it on another form as per our GC. Please confirm the status.\u201d Later that same day, Strober sent the following email to Dobco, copying the underwriter at Colonial.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b285-6\">Hossam. I\u2019ve reached out to our Bond company on several occasions requesting the Wm. Patterson Bond being re-sent on the form you requested. The bond is active but I\u2019m unable to get this on your form as quickly as you would like. As soon as they change the form I will forward to you. I\u2019ve cc\u2019d the bond coL-J as well. Thanks[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">Dobco called Colonial and was also advised the bond was active. On July 27, Strober sent an internal email, copying the underwriter at Colonial, advising that the underwriter was \u201cnot real comfortable with [Dobco\u2019s] form,\u201d and would review the contract provision requiring that the bond be issued in that format.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">Dobco subsequently terminated Strober, which thereafter sought bankruptcy protection. Dobco filed a claim against Colo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"258\">*258</page-number>nial under the bond. Colonial denied the claim on the basis that Dobco rejected both sets of bonds, both sets of bonds name WPU as the obligee, and Dobco knew or should have known \u201cthat the Alleged Second Bonds were unauthorized and that there was never an agreement between Strober and WPU in connection with the Project.\u201d Colonial claimed that \u201c[njeither the Bonds nor the Alleged Second Bonds are in effect nor subject to claim by Dobco.\u201d Colonial has never revoked the bonds nor returned the premium to Strober.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">After hearing argument <em>on the </em>parties\u2019 cross-motions, the Law Division judge issued a written opinion granting summary judgment to Colonial dismissing Dobco\u2019s claims. Relying on well-settled law \u201cthat a surety is chargeable only according to the strict terms of its undertaking and its obligation cannot and should not be extended either by implication or by construction beyond the confines of its contract,\u201d <em>Monmouth Lumber Co. v. Indem. Ins. Co. of N. Am., </em>21 <em>N.J. </em>439, 452, 122 A.2d 604 (1956), the judge found that WPU and <em>not </em>Dobco was the designated obligee under both sets of bonds. The judge further found that Dobco rejected both the first and second set of bonds and thus no valid contract was formed between Colonial and Dobco.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">The judge rejected Dobco\u2019s claim for reformation as the language of the bond was \u201cclear and not ambiguous\u201d and there was no evidence of mutual mistake because \u201c[t]he undisputed evidence establishes that at the time of issuance, Colonial was unaware that the bonded subcontract agreement was between Strober and Dobco.\u201d The judge acknowledged \u201cDobeo\u2019s general argument that Colonial had a duty to read and approve the underlying contract mentioned in the bond agreements\u201d but found that \u201cDob-co has not supported said argument or conclusion with facts or competent expert opinion that Colonial, the surety in this particular matter, or any surety as a matter of standard industry practice, had a duty to do so.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"259\">*259</page-number>Dobco contends that the trial judge erred in concluding that Dobco had no rights under the bond or Strober\u2019s contract with Colonial and further erred in concluding on summary judgment that Dobco rejected the bonds. We review summary judgment using the same standard that governs the trial court. <em>Henry v. N.J. Dep\u2019t of Human Servs., </em>204 <em>N.J. </em>320, 330, 9 A.3d 882 (2010). Our first task here is thus to determine whether the motion judge was correct in determining that Dobco had no rights under the bond or Strober\u2019s surety contract with Colonial. <em>See Prudential Prop. &amp; Cas. Ins. Co. v. Boylan, </em>307 <em>N. J.Super. </em>162,167, 704 A.2d 597 (App.Div), <em>certif. denied, </em>154 <em>N.J. </em>608, 713 A.2d 499 (1998). Because a trial court does not enjoy the advantage in discerning the law that it does in discerning the facts, a reviewing court owes no special deference to the \u201ctrial court\u2019s interpretation of the law and the legal consequences that flow from established facts.\u201d <em>Manalapan Realty, L.P. v. Twp. Comm, of Manalapan, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>366, 378, 658 A.2d 1230 (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">\u201c \u2018Suretyship is a contractual relation resulting from an agreement whereby one person, the surety, engages to be answerable for the debt, default or miscarriage of another, the principal.\u2019 \u201d <em>Eagle Fire Prot. Corp. v. First Indem. of Am. Ins. Co., </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>345, 353, 678 A.2d 699 (1996) (quoting <em>Amelco Window Corp. v. Fed. Ins. Co., </em>127 <em>N. J.Super. </em>342, 346, 317 A.2d 398 (App.Div. 1974)). Traditionally, these relationships involve three parties: \u201can obligee who is owed a debt or duty; a primary obligor, who is responsible for the payment of the debt or performance of the duty; and a secondary obligor, or surety, who agrees to answer for the primary obligor\u2019s debt or duty.\u201d <em>Cruz-Mendez v. Isu/Ins. Servs, of San Francisco, </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>556, 568, 722 A.2d 515 (1999). The obligee has an enforceable cause of action to recover on the debt from the surety \u201cif the surety promises in the bond, either in express words or by reasonable implication, to pay money to him.\u201d <em>Eagle Fire Prot. Corp., supra, </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>at 353-54, 678 A.2d 699.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">New Jersey does not have as extensive a body of surety-ship law as do some other states, as evidenced by the parties\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"260\">*260</page-number>extensive reliance on out-of-state authority. We do, however, have some well-established principles to guide a court\u2019s interpretation of a surety bond, most notably that when a bond incorporates a contract by reference, the bond and the contract must be considered as one integrated document in ascertaining the meaning of the bond\u2019s provisions. <em>Id. </em>at 356-57, 678 A.2d 699.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">Here, despite the performance bond\u2019s explicit reference to Strober\u2019s contract for the Science Hall Addition at WPU dated November 11, 2008, the Law Division declined to consider the contract in interpreting the language of the bond. Instead, relying on the well-established principle \u201cthat a surety is chargeable only according to the strict terms of its undertaking and its obligation cannot and should not be extended either by implication or by construction beyond the conf\u00ednes of its contract,\u201d <em>Monmouth Lumber Co., supra, </em>21 <em>N.J. </em>at 452, 122 A.2d 604 the court concluded that Dobco had no rights under the bond because Colonial\u2019s promise was unambiguously to WPU, the stated obligee.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">In employing that principle of strict construction in interpreting the bond, we think the trial court erred. The <em>Restatement </em>makes plain that the principle relied on by the trial court, although well known and oft-quoted, applies only after one has determined the extent of the surety\u2019s undertaking. It is not to be used to interpret the language creating the surety\u2019s obligations under the bond. Instead, the <em>Restatement </em>holds that contracts creating secondary obligations are to be interpreted by the same standards that apply to interpretation of contracts generally. <em>Restatement (Third) of Suretyship and Guaranty </em>\u00a7 14 (Interpretation of the Secondary Obligation \u2014 Generally) (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">The Reporters Notes explain the problem. Observing that \u201c[t]here are few, if any, principles of suretyship law that cause more confusion than the standards of interpretation of contracts creating secondary obligations,\u201d the Notes continue:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b288-8\">The principle adopted by this section, distinguishing interpretation of the contract creating the secondary obligation from the application of substantive principles of suretyship law to that contract, has been stated as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"261\">*261</page-number>\u201cHowever, the rule of strictissimi juris requires only that, after the meaning of the contract of guarantee has been determined according to ordinary principles of contract construction, the obligations undertaken by the guarantor are to be strictly applied.... Thus, while \u2018[t]he liability of a surety cannot be extended beyond the plain and explicit language of the contract ... a surety is not entitled to any particular tenderness in the interpretation of the language of the contract.\u2019 \u201d <em>Banco Portugues do Atlantico v. Asland, S.A., </em>745 <em>F.Supp. </em>962, 967-68 (S.D.N.Y. 1990) (quoting 63 <em>N.Y.Jur.2d Guaranty and Suretyships[] </em>\u00a7 89 (1987)) (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-5\"><em>[Ibid, </em>(alteration in original).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">A close reading of our own law reveals it in accord with the <em>Restatement. See e.g., Eagle Fire Prot. Corp., supra, </em>145 <em>N.J. </em>at 356, 678 A.2d 699 (noting the rule of strict construction \u201chas been modified, if the language in the construction bond is ambiguous\u201d (citing <em>V. Petrillo &amp; Son, Inc. v. Am. Constr. Co., </em>148 <em>N.J.Super. </em>1, 4-5, 371 A.2d 799 (App.Div.), <em>cert,if. denied, </em>75 <em>N.J. </em>4, 379 A.2d 235 (1977))). The <em>Restatement </em>approach is further reflected in the Court\u2019s admonition that when the bond incorporates the contract by reference, \u201cthe bond and the contract must be considered as one integrated document.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 356, 678 A.2d 699. As such, the bond</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-7\">\u201cshould be construed in connection with, and in the light of, [the] contract with which it was executed or the performance of which it secures, especially where the bond refers to the contract and makes it part of the bond. Thus, the bond, the contract, and the specifications constitute an integrated obligation, and are to be read together.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-8\"><em>[Id. </em>at 357, 678 A.2d 699 (quoting 17 <em>Am.Jur.2d Contractors\u2019 Bonds </em>\u00a7 7 (1990)).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ATW\">Under our ordinary rules of construction, contract provisions are to be \u201cread as a whole, without artificial emphasis on one section, with a consequent disregard for others.\u201d <em>Borough of Princeton v. Bd. of Chosen Freeholders of the Cnty. of Mercer, </em>333 <em>N.J.Super. </em>310, 325, 755 A.2d 637 (App.Div.2000), <em>aff'd, </em>169 <em>N.J. </em>135, 777 A.2d 19 (2001). \u201cLiteralism must give way to context.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Applying those standards here, it is inescapable that the bond was intended to secure Strober\u2019s obligations under its November 11, 2008 contract with Dobco, notwithstanding the bond\u2019s identification of WPU as the obligee. There is no other contract than the one Strober had with Dobco, and Strober owed no obligation of any sort to WPU. We may not ignore the general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"262\">*262</page-number>design of the agreement in ascertaining the sense of particular terms, even one so central as the identity of the obligee. <em>See Krosnowski v. Krosnowski, </em>22 <em>N.J. </em>376, 387, 126 A.2d 182 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">Having determined that Colonial bound itself to answer for Strober\u2019s performance under the subcontract, we are led ineluctably to conclude that Colonial agreed to do so in the manner specified therein, that is, on Dobco\u2019s own form. The Dobeo/Strober subcontract makes absolutely clear that Strober agreed to provide Dobco with a performance bond in the sum of $890,000 in the form annexed to the agreement. The hallmark of a contract of suretyship is the surety\u2019s direct and primary undertaking to answer for the performance of the principal. <em>Cruz-Mendez, supra, </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>at 569, 722 A.2d 515 (noting \u201cthe unique characteristics of suretyship remain intact in New Jersey, <em>Newark Fin. Corp. v. Acocella, </em>115 <em>N.J.L. </em>388, 180 A 862 (Sup.Ct.1935) (explaining that surety undertakes \u2018direct and primary obligation, as distinguished from guarantor, whose obligation is \u2018secondary and \u2018collateral\u2019)\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">Here, Strober undertook to produce a performance bond in a required sum on a particular form. When Colonial agreed to bond that performance, it undertook the obligation to do so in the form required by the contract. That Colonial chose not to review the contract it bonded cannot relieve it of obligations voluntarily undertaken. It has long been the law of this State that \u201c[t]he surety is chargeable with knowledge of the contents of the contract it undertook to guarantee.\u201d <em>Jersey City Water Co. v. Metropolitan Const. Co., </em>76 <em>N.J.L. </em>419, 421, 69 A 1088 (Sup.Ct. 1908). The law of other jurisdictions is in accord. <em>See e.g., Western N.Y. Life Ins. Co. v. Clinton, </em>66 <em>N.Y. </em>326, 331-32 (1876) (\u201cIt is the duty of the sureties to look out for themselves and ascertain the nature of the obligation embraced in the undertaking, and any other rule would not only work serious inconvenience, but render securities of this character of but little, if of any, value.\u201d); <em>see also Rachman Bag Co. v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., </em>46 F.3d 230, 235 (2d Cir.1995) (decided under New York law). Ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"263\">*263</page-number>cordingly, we disagree with the Law Division that Dobco required expert testimony to establish the existence of a duty on the part of the surety to inform itself of its obligations under the agreement incorporated in its bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">Because we conclude that by entering into its contract with Strober and accepting Strober\u2019s premium payment, Colonial voluntarily obligated itself to issue its bond in the form required by the Dobco/Strober subcontract, we reject the Law Division\u2019s finding that reformation was unavailable here. Reformation based on mutual mistake requires clear and convincing evidence that the parties\u2019 minds have met in a prior existing agreement that their written agreement fails to express. <em>Bonnco Petrol, Inc. v. Epstein, </em>115 <em>N.J. </em>599, 608, 560 A.2d 655 (1989). The Court has explained \u201cthat in the context of situations where a writing inaccurately reflects the parties\u2019 agreement or intentions, \u2018mutual mistake requires that <em>both </em>parties are in agreement at the time they attempt to reduce their understanding to writing, and the writing fails to express that understanding correctly.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 609, 560 A.2d 655 (quoting <em>St. Pius X House of Retreats v. The Diocese of Camden, </em>88 <em>N.J. </em>571, 579, 443 A.2d 1052 (1982)).</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">Here, there can be no doubt that Strober and Colonial both intended that Colonial would bond Strober\u2019s obligations under its November 11, 2008 contract to perform the roofing work at WPU because the bond Colonial issued references an agreement for such work dated November 11, 2008, and there is no other contract to which that reference could apply. Colonial\u2019s failure to correctly identify the obligee and to issue its bond on the form incorporated in the Dobco/Strober subcontract did not result from any failure of a meeting of the minds between Colonial and Strober but solely from Colonial\u2019s election not to review the contract it had agreed to bond. As our law charges the surety with knowledge of the Dobco/Strober subcontract, reformation is the appropriate remedy in these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"264\">*264</page-number>Finally, we reject Colonial\u2019s argument that it was relieved of its obligation to Strober by Dobco\u2019s supposed rejection of the non-conforming bond<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Strober tendered to Dobco. While Colonial argues that the law requires acceptance of the bond by the obligee before the surety is chargeable, no New Jersey case says so, although that appears generally to be the law elsewhere, at least with regard to the older cases.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Rachman Bag Co., supra, </em>46 F.3d at 238 (2d Cir.1995) (discussing traditional requirements of delivery and acceptance under New York law).</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">Although we have found no New Jersey authority on the necessity of acceptance of a surety bond by the obligee, the few New Jersey cases treating delivery in the context of a suretyship make clear that in this area, as in others, our law does not exalt form over substance. <em>See, e.g., Real Estate-Land Title &amp; Trust Co. v. Stout, </em>117 <em>N.J. Eq. </em>37, 41-43, 175 <em>A. </em>128 (1934) (finding no delivery where delivery made in absence of all required signatures); <em>State Bank at Trenton v. Evans, </em>15 <em>N.J.L. </em>155, 161 (Sup.Ct.1835) (finding bond inoperative in the hands of the obligee, by whatever means he got possession, until condition of its delivery is performed); <em>Folly v. Vantuyl, </em>9 <em>N.J.L. </em>153,158-59 (Sup.Ct. 1827) (noting \u201c[t]hat there is no precise or set form in which a delivery must be made\u201d and finding constructive delivery to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"265\">*265</page-number>obligee with words \u201chere is your bond, what shall I do with it\u201d). The common law requirement of delivery to the obligee was based on solicitude for guarantors and accommodation parties, many of whom formerly were individuals not receiving any remuneration for their promises. <em>See, e.g., Peoples Nat\u2019l Bank of N.J. v. Fowler, </em>73 <em>N.J. </em>88, 98-100, 372 A.2d 1096 (strictly construing surety\u2019s obligation where surety uncompensated), <em>cert, denied, </em>434 <em>U.S. </em>858, 98 <em>S.Ct. </em>182, 54 L.Ed.2d 131 (1977); <em>Bank of Tarboro v. Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co., </em>128 <em>N.C. </em>366, 38 <em>S.E. </em>908 (1901) (distinguishing between private and paid sureties). The older cases hold that notice of acceptance to the surety was required in the case of non-absolute obligations because the surety would not otherwise know whether it was obligated on its offer, <em>Acme Mfg. Co. v. Reed, </em>197 <em>Pa. </em>359, 47 A. 205, 206-08 (1900) (\u201ca party giving a letter of guaranty has a right to know whether the person to whom it is addressed means to hold him ultimately responsible, inasmuch as his own caution and vigilance may, in a great measure, be regulated by his knowledge of the fact\u201d), or whether its form was acceptable to the obligee, <em>see Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co. v. West Point Construction Co., </em>178 <em>Ga.App. </em>578, 344 S.E.2d 268, 269-70 (1986) (discussing contract requirement that performance bond be provided in form acceptable to the contractor).</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">Because no New Jersey case requires acceptance by the obligee before the surety can be charged, we are not called to consider whether such precedent, founded in a different era in consideration of a variety of instruments many of which are now obsolete, should apply to this performance bond issued for consideration by an insurance company specializing in contract surety. Instead, our focus is on the substance of the Dobco/Strober subcontract Colonial voluntarily undertook to bond.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">Dobco was entitled by the terms of that agreement to a performance bond in the sum of $890,000 on the specific form incorporated therein. By contracting with Strober to bond Stro-ber\u2019s obligations under its subcontract with Dobco, Colonial obligated itself to issue the performance bond on Dobco\u2019s form. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"266\">*266</page-number>Colonial is in the business of writing surety bonds, and it accepted a premium from Strober for this bond, which it has never returned. Under these circumstances, we have no hesitation in rejecting Colonial\u2019s argument that Dobco\u2019s unwillingness to accept less than what it contracted for, and Colonial promised, relieved Colonial of its contractual obligation to Dobeo.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">Reversed and remanded for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b281-10\"> This action began as a book account complaint by Allied Building Products Corp. (Allied), a material supplier to Strober, against Strober, Dobco and Colonial. Dobco\u2019s affirmative claims against Colonial were thus properly denominated as cross-claims in that action. Because Allied's claims, which were resolved prior to these motions, are irrelevant to the issues before us, we do not discuss them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b282-7\"> As only the performance bond is at issue here, we limit our discussion to it, although acknowledging that it was issued in tandem with the payment bond and the premium Strober paid Colonial was apparently for both bonds.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b282-8\"> Colonial\u2019s witnesses testified at deposition about the inquiries made in this matter with reference to notes on a bid bond request form printed the day before Colonial issued its performance bond. Colonial\u2019s underwriter testified that the notes would have been created by the bond administrator in the normal course of approving Strober\u2019s request for the performance bond and that the information reflected in the notes was in hand before the underwriter approved the issuance of the bond on February 25, 2009. Among other things, Colonial\u2019s notes on this document, which is not in the appendix, indicate that Dobco was the general contractor on the project and also state \"Science Hall subcontractor to general contractor.\u201d Although the notes might appear to suggest that Colonial had actual knowledge of the true state of Strober\u2019s role in the WPU project before Colonial issued its performance bond, we cannot draw that conclusion on this record and do not rely on any such knowledge by Colonial here.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b286-7\"> The judge also addressed and rejected Dobco's claims under an assignment from WPU and the application of equitable estoppel. As our resolution of the appeal makes it unnecessary to reach these claims, we do not discuss them.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b292-6\"> We refer here to the Colonial bond. Our resolution of the appeal makes it unnecessary for us to consider the parties\u2019 arguments concerning the second Strober \"bond,\" only a copy of which was ever sent to Dobco, and without the surety disclosure statement and certification, general power of attorney and financial disclosure.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b292-7\"> More modern authority suggests, at least in the area of construction contract suretyship where custom and industry practice is well established, that the surety\u2019s communication to the obligee of its intent to be bound is sufficient to bind the surety before execution and delivery of the bonds in final form. <em>See Turner </em>Const. Co. v. <em>First Indem, of Am. Ins. Co., </em>829 <em>F.Supp. 752, </em>760-61 (E.D.Pa.1993) (\"Pennsylvania statutory law confirms the conclusion that [the surety's] letter of intent on September 29, 1990 as a matter of industry practice and [the surety\u2019s] express words constituted a binding and enforceable surety contract even before execution and delivery of the bonds in their final form\").</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
