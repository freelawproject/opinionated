Defendant Armando Car-reon appeals from the (partial) denial of his petition for post-conviction relief contending that he was subject to an illegal sentence consisting of a fine and a custodial term following his guilty plea to driving without a license, <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:3-10. We agree that defendant\u2019s sentence is illegal and thus reverse and remand for resentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">Following a traffic stop in 2012, defendant was charged with failing to stop at a stop sign, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-144, and driving without a license, <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:3-10. Represented by the public defender, defendant pled guilty to unlicensed driving, and the stop sign violation was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-10\">Reviewing defendant\u2019s abstract and finding that this was his third conviction for unlicensed driving, the municipal court judge imposed a $756 fine, $33 in court costs and a ten-day jail term without a statement of reasons as required by <em>Rule </em>7:9-l(c). The judge commented only that defendant \u201cshould have been charged on this occasion with driving while suspended, but he wasn\u2019t.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>The judge did not consider the sentencing standards imposed in <em>State v. Moran, </em>202 <em>N.J. </em>311, 328-30, 997 A.2d 210 (2010) (setting standards to guide the discretion of judges imposing license suspensions under <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:5-31), or suggested in <em>State v. Henry, </em>418 <em>N.J.Super. </em>481, 490-97, 14 A.3d 750 (Law Div.2010) (employing the aggravating and mitigating factors found in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:44-l(a) and (b) in determining whether a custodial sentence was appropriate for a third conviction under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:4-50).</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">Defendant did not seek de novo review of his sentence in the Law Division. Instead, prior to the date he was to begin serving his custodial term, he filed a PCR petition in the municipal court pursuant to <em>Rule </em>7:10 \u2014 2(b)(1). Although defendant\u2019s counsel was advised by the municipal court staff that defendant\u2019s petition had been denied, the municipal court judge refused to issue an order to that effect, despite defense counsel\u2019s efforts to secure one.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">The Law Division stayed the custodial aspect of defendant\u2019s sentence and considered his PCR petition on the merits. Although terming the $756 fine as \u201cexcessive, not illegal,\u201d the Law Division judge nonetheless granted defendant\u2019s petition limited to a reduction of the fine to the \u201cmaximum penalty [of] $500.\u201d The judge rejected defendant\u2019s argument that <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:3-10 allowed either a mandatory minimum fine <em>of </em>$200 in defendant\u2019s case, or imprisonment, but not both.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-8\">Defendant appeals. We stayed the custodial aspect of his sentence pending our review of the merits of his appeal. Because we agree that the statute allows a fine or imprisonment but not both, even for drivers, who, like defendant, have never been licensed, we now reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>The penalty provisions of the unlicensed driver statute provide as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-6\">A person violating this section shall be subject to a fine not exceeding $500 or imprisonment in the county jail for not more than 60 days, but if that person has never been licensed to drive in this State or any other jurisdiction, he shall be subject to a fine of not less than $200 and, in addition, the court shall issue an order to the commission requiring the commission to refuse to issue a license to operate a motor vehicle to the person for a period of not less than 180 days. The penalties provided for by this paragraph shall not be applicable in eases where failure to have actual possession of the operator\u2019s license is due to an administrative or technical error by the commission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-7\"><em>[N.J.S.A. </em>39:3-10.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">We begin, as the canons of construction counsel, with what is clear from the plain meaning of the text. <em>State ex rel. K.O., </em>217 <em>N.J. </em>83, 91, 85 A.3d 938 (2014). Here the text makes obvious that the statute mandates either fine or imprisonment \u2014 but not both \u2014 for violators who have previously been licensed to drive in New Jersey or elsewhere. The question is how that first clause relates to the penalty provided in the second, \u201cbut if\u2019 clause for drivers who have never been licensed here or elsewhere.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">Defendant argues that the \u201cbut if\u2019 clause plainly subjects the never-licensed violator to a minimum $200 fine, but only in the event the judge chooses to fine instead of imprison. He contends, in effect, that the \u201cbut if\u2019 clause circumscribes, but does not override, the overarching design to penalize those driving without a license with a f\u00edne or imprisonment but not both.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-10\">The State contends that the $200 fine, like the 180-day \u201csuspension\u201d is mandatory for all never-licensed drivers convicted under the statute. It argues that never-licensed drivers are subject to a fine or imprisonment <em>and </em>a minimum $200 fine and 180-day period in which they may not be issued a license. The State, however, allows that there is some relation between the first and second clauses because it agrees with plaintiff that the maximum fine for a never-licensed driver is $500.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-11\">Defendant contends that the State\u2019s reading of the statute, adopted by the Law Division judge, is illogical. He reasons that if the maximum fine for a never-licensed driver \u201crelates back\u201d to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>first clause as the State concedes, then so logically must the minimum fine. The State counters that the logical import of defendant\u2019s argument, in light of the plain language which directs that never-licensed drivers \u201cshall\u201d be subject to a minimum fine, would prevent a judge from ever imposing a custodial sentence, thus defeating the Legislature\u2019s clear intention to enhance the statutory penalty for never-licensed violators.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">The proper interpretation of a statute is a question of law that we review de novo. <em>McGovern v. Rutgers, </em>211 <em>N.J. </em>94, 107-08, 47 A.3d 724 (2012). Our goal, of course, is to determine and effect the Legislature\u2019s intent. <em>See K.O., supra, </em>217 <em>N.J. </em>at 91, 85 A.3d 938. We begin with the words of the statute, which we are to give their ordinary meaning and construe in a commonsense manner. <em>Ibid. </em>If the language is unclear or ambiguous, \u201cor if the Legislature\u2019s intention is otherwise uncertain,\u201d we may resort \u201cto extrinsic aids to \u2018assist us in our understanding of the Legislature\u2019s will.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 92, 85 A.3d 938 (quoting <em>Pizzullo v. N.J. Mfrs. Ins. Co., </em>196 <em>N.J. </em>251, 264, 952A.2d 1077 (2008)).</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">The Legislature amended <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:3-10 in 1982 to add the penalty for the never-licensed driver in the clause we interpret as part of a larger effort to address various penalty provisions in Title 39.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>L. </em>1982, c. 45, \u00a7 1. With regard to this provision, the Sponsor\u2019s Statement provided: \u201c[t]he bill establishes a $200.00 minimum fine and a provision for a court order to the director delaying the issuance of a license for 6 months to anyone who drives and who has never obtained a license.\u201d <em>Sponsor\u2019s Statement to S. 904, </em>at 5 (Feb. 1, 1982). In approving the bill, the Senate Public Safety and Defense Committee noted that the bill \u201cprovides that a person who drives without ever having obtained a 3icense[ ] will be fined a minimum of $200.00.\u201d <em>See Senate Public Safety &amp; Defense Committee, Statement to S. 904 </em>(Feb. 8, 1982). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"87\">*87</page-number>Finally, Governor Kean, in his signing statement, likewise noted that the statute was intended to \u201cincrease[ ] penalties for unlicensed driving ... [to include a] $200 [fine] if never licensedf.]\u201d <em>Governor\u2019s Signing Statement to S. 321 </em>(1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-6\">Although the statute is mentioned in many opinions, the penalty provision appears never to have been construed. In <em>State v. Handy, </em>74 <em>N.J.Super. </em>294, 299, 181 A.2d 203 (Atl.Cty.Ct. 1962), the county court distinguished the statute from the more serious violation of driving on a suspended license, <em>N.J.S.A. </em>39:3-40. The court observed that \u201c[i]n violating <em>N.J.S.A </em>39:3-10 the offender signifies his possible inaptitude to drive a motor vehicle, and circumvents the licensing authority, regulations, and fees of this State,\u201d whereas by \u201cviolating <em>N.J.SA </em>39:3-40 the offender asserts his defiance of public sanctions imposed for community safety.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>Accordingly, neither prior precedent nor the spare legislative history provides guidance in resolving the meaning of the amendment enhancing the penalty for never-licensed drivers.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">Although the Legislature oftentimes uses \u201cor\u201d and \u201cand\u201d interchangeably and whether they are conjunctive or disjunctive \u201c \u2018depends primarily upon the legislative intent,\u2019 \u201d <em>Pine Belt Chevrolet v. Jersey Cent. Power &amp; Light Co., </em>132 <em>N.J. </em>564, 578, 626 A.2d 434 (1993) (quoting <em>Howard v. Harwood\u2019s Rest. Co., </em>25 <em>N.J. </em>72, 88, 135 A.2d 161 (1957)), here no one disputes, as it relates to previously licensed drivers, that the provision is plainly disjunctive: a judge may fine such offenders or sentence them to the county jail but may not do both. <em>See State v. Duva, </em>192 <em>N.J.Super. </em>418, 421, 470 A.2d 53 (Law Div.1983) (noting that \u201cthe word \u2018or\u2019 carries with it natural disjunctive import\u201d). The difficulty arises out of the second clause \u201cbut if that person has never been licensed ... he shall be subject to a fine of not less than $200,\u201d or, more specifically, the relation of that clause to the disjunctive provision of the statute\u2019s first clause. <em>N.J.SA </em>39:3-10.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">We think it apparent from the plain language that the Legislature intended to guarantee a minimum sentence of a $200 fine and a six-month suspension in which no license may issue for such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>never-licensed drivers. With <em>regard </em>to whether such drivers may additionally be sentenced to jail, however, the statute is susceptible to two possible interpretations.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">One is the one adopted by the Law Division that such drivers must always receive a fine of at least $200 and a six-month suspension and may also receive up to sixty days in the county jail. The strength of that interpretation is that the Legislature\u2019s use of \u201cbut\u201d rather than \u201cand\u201d suggests that the second clause is meant to be an exception to the first clause, and that \u201cshall\u201d suggests a mandatory fine. Its weakness is the acceptance that the fine is capped at the $500 of the first clause, suggesting that the overarching design of fine or imprisonment holds for never-licensed drivers as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">The other interpretation is the one urged by defendant, that the \u201cbut if\u2019 clause creates only a minimum fine in the event the judge imposes a fine rather than imprisonment in the county jail. The strength of that interpretation is that it accounts for the entirety of both clauses. Emphasizing that the clause states only that never-licensed drivers \u201cshall be subject to\u201d a $200 minimum fine, which shall be capped at $500, and that never-licensed drivers are not \u201csubject to\u201d a fine \u201cand\u201d a suspension, but that the suspension is \u201cin addition\u201d to the minimum fine to which such drivers are subject, defendant argues that the \u201cbut if\u2019 clause modifies but does not supplant the fine or jail alternatives of the first clause. The interpretation\u2019s weakness is that if \u201cshall\u201d is mandatory and a judge may not impose a fine and jail on a never-licensed driver, then the never-licensed driver may never be sentenced to jail, a result clearly not intended by the Legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">Both interpretations are plainly reasonable ones. Indeed, they have an almost Escher-like quality in that viewing the statute from the perspective of one of them makes it hard to readily admit the plausibility of the other. We are persuaded, however, that viewing the \u201cbut if\u2019 clause as circumscribing, but not overriding, the overarching design of the statute to penalize those driving without a license with a fine or imprisonment but not both, best <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>effectuates the Legislature\u2019s intent in amending the statute to impose a harsher penalty on never-licensed drivers.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">First, viewing the statute in this way harmonizes both clauses and gives effect to all of the words the Legislature employed. <em>See K.O., supra, </em>217 <em>N.J. </em>at 94, 85 A.3d 938 (noting that the rules of statutory construction require deference to the words chosen by the Legislature). It reads the statute to provide both a minimum sentence and a maximum fine while preserving judicial discretion for a harsher custodial term for both unlicensed and never-licensed drivers. Our construction thus addresses the logical inconsistencies raised by the parties, effects the intent of the Legislature, to the extent it can be discerned, and preserves the discretion of the sentencing judge to impose either a fine or jail time within the limits of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-6\">We note also that while we would not wish to overemphasize internal consistency in a title as vast and so often amended as Title 39, nevertheless, when the Legislature intends fine or imprisonment, or both, for a motor vehicle offense, it often says so plainly. <em>See, e.g., N.J.S.A </em>39:4-96 (reckless driving); <em>N.J.SA </em>39:4-36b (failure to yield to a pedestrian); <em>N.J.SA </em>39:4-49 (tampering with vehicle).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">Finally, our construction appears in keeping with the popular understanding and practical interpretation of the statute in the municipal courts since its amendment in 1982. <em>See </em>24 <em>New Jersey Practice, Motor Vehicle Law and Practice, </em>\u00a7 2.103 at 67-68 (Robert Ramsay) (rev.3d ed.2001). That long understanding unchallenged by litigation is entitled to some deference. <em>See N.J. Ass\u2019n on Corr. v. Lan, </em>80 <em>N.J. </em>199, 215, 403 A.2d 437 (1979) (\u201c \u2018Like all precedents, where contemporaneous and practical interpretation has stood unchallenged for a considerable length of time it will be regarded as of great importance in arriving at the proper construction of a statute.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting 2A Sutherland, <em>Statutes &amp; Statutory Constr. </em>\u00a7 49.07, 251-52 (4th ed.1973)).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">We reverse defendant\u2019s sentence and remand to the Law Division for resentencing. Should the Law Division judge consider <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>imposing a custodial term rather than a fine, he shall apply the standards enunciated in <em>Moran, supra, </em>202 <em>N.J. </em>at 328, 997 A.2d 210, and <em>Henry, supra, </em>418 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 490-91, 14 A.3d 750. We do not retain jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-6\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b111-11\"> Although we have not been provided with defendant\u2019s driving abstract, which both judges reviewed and relied upon in making their rulings, we can discern no basis for the municipal judge\u2019s statement. Defendant\u2019s prior violations are noted in the Law Division transcript to have occurred in 2005 and 2008. Apparently, neither conviction was accompanied by the mandatory 180-day suspension order required by <em>NJ.S.A. </em>39:3-10. The municipal judge noted, however, that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>defendant \"restored\u201d following his conviction for driving under the influence, <em>NJ.S.A. </em>39:4-50, which accompanied his 2005 conviction for unlicensed driving. Accordingly, we see no basis to conclude that defendant's conduct could support a violation of <em>NJ.S.A. </em>39:3-40.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b114-8\"> The text of this portion of the statute has since been altered only once, to remove the decimal point from the fine ($500.00 to $500 and $200.00 to $200). <em>SeeL. </em>1998, c. 108, \u00a7 1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
