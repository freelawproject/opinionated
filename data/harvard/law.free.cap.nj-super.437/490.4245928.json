During that deliberative process, the Planning Board (the Board) considered whether to permit digital multiple message billboards, receiving information from plaintiff E &amp; J Equities (E &amp; J) and other sources. Concluding that a determination whether to permit a digital billboard was best made within the context of an application for a conditional variance, the Board proposed and the Township adopted Ordinance No. 3875-10 (the Ordinance), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>which prohibited such billboards.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After E &amp; J\u2019s application for a variance to erect an electronic billboard was denied, it commenced this litigation, challenging the constitutionality of the Ordinance and the denial of its application for a variance.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">The trial court affirmed the denial of the variance, finding the Township\u2019s decision to deny E &amp; J\u2019s application was not arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable. The court also rejected E &amp; J\u2019s equal protection argument. But, relying upon language in <em>Bell v. Township of Stafford, </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>384, 541 A.2d 692 (1988), the trial court found the Ordinance\u2019s ban violated the First Amendment. The sole issue presented by the Township\u2019s appeal is whether the Ordinance\u2019s ban on digital billboards passes constitutional muster. For the reasons that follow, we conclude that it does.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b524-6\">\u201c[T]he right to free speech is not absolute and is subject to reasonable limitations.\u201d <em>Besler v.

Accordingly, billboards are the subject of federal, state and local regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">Consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s observation regarding the nature of signs, both Congress<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and our Legislature<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> have identified the promotion of safety on the highways and the preservation of natural beauty as interests to be served in their regulation of billboards.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">All roadside signs in New Jersey are subject to conditions and restrictions established by <em>N.J.S.A. </em>27:5-9. \u201cOff-premise multiple message signs,\u201d such as the one E &amp; J sought to erect, are subject to additional conditions. <em>N.J.A.C. </em>16:41C-8.8(a)(l) requires an application and a permit specific to that use when the off-premise multiple message sign would be visible to a highway. The regula<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"498\">*498</page-number>tion states that, provided the conditions enumerated in <em>N.J.A.C. </em>16:41C-8.8(a) are met, the Department of Transportation (NJDOT) \u201cshall grant permission\u201d for the use. Because <em>N.J.S.A </em>27:5-9.1 provides that, after NJDOT issues the permit, any billboard \u201cto be erected on or above any State right-of-way ... shall be subject to local government zoning ordinances[,]\u201d it is evident <em>N.J.A.C. </em>16:41C-8.8(a) establishes threshold requirements that must be satisfied without limiting the authority of local government to further regulate billboards. We therefore turn to the Township\u2019s effort to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">In February 2008, the Board began the process of revamping the Township\u2019s regulation of billboards by authorizing the Zoning Officer to prepare a draft billboard ordinance. Over the following year, the drafting of the Ordinance was a matter of discussion at the Board\u2019s meetings. Input was received from both the Land Use and Open Space Committee and the Township\u2019s Environmental Commission. Plaintiff engaged actively in the deliberative process, appearing before the Board to discuss a lighting study supporting its position that LED lighting was appropriate, and even submitting a suggested ordinance for the Board\u2019s consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">Minutes and memoranda from the various meetings reflect the Board\u2019s consideration of digital billboards and the impact of the size and placement of billboards along Interstate 287 (1-287) upon driver safety, as well as the Environmental Commission\u2019s concerns regarding the glare from billboards onto residential properties and that billboards not be visible from residential properties. At the direction of the Land Use and Open Space Committee, the draft ordinance was revised to include a ban on variable message and electronic signage throughout the Township. One memo noted the draft ordinance\u2019s \u201crather unique requirement,\u201d reducing the maximum distance of billboards from the highway, which was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>intended to reduce overall tree removal and the likelihood that billboards would be visible from local roadways.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">In January 2009, Mark Healey, the Township\u2019s Director of Planning, reported to the Board regarding: his survey of existing billboards; potentially acceptable locations along Route 27 and I-287; and potential location, bulk, and design requirements. Hea-ley recommended against allowing billboards on Route 27 because most of the area under consideration there had been developed and placement in front of existing businesses \u201cwould significantly detract from community character.\u201d He advised further that if the Board wanted to consider locations on Route 27, a few commercially zoned locations might be appropriate because \u201cthey are either undeveloped or have features (e.g., transmission tower or industrial use) that already detract from the aesthetics of the area.\u201d As to potential design restrictions, the memo recommended against permitting billboards to \u201crotate, move, produce noise or smoke, give the illusion of movement, display video or other changing imagery, automatically change or be animated or blinking.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">The Board submitted a draft zoning ordinance to the Mayor and Council in April 2009. The accompanying memo reports that the Board \u201cspent four worksession meetings on the proposed ordinance and did a field visit to assess potential impacts.\u201d The Board determined that permitting billboards along 1-287 would be the most appropriate means of addressing potential First Amendment claims on the part of billboard companies. The memo discussed the Board\u2019s reasoning:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-8\">The draft ordinance was carefully crafted to minimize impact to the character of Franklin, particularly to the residential properties on the north side of I-287. For example, the ordinance would: limit the number of potential billboards; require that billboards be a certain distance apart; would limit their height and size; and would NOT allow billboards adjacent to the residential properties along the north side of I-287 (i.e., billboards would ONLY be permitted on the industrially-zoned land on the opposite side of I-287).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">Specifically addressing the issue of digital billboards, the memo stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>It should be noted that the Board spent a good amount of time discussing whether to permit LED billboards in the ordinance. In the end, the Board decided that it would be best to not permit LED billboards in the Ordinance. This was done because the Board felt that it did not have enough information or sufficient expertise to craft ordinance language to appropriately address LED billboards. The Board, however, did not make a determination whether LED billboards would be inappropriate. If a billboard company wanted to pursue a LED billboard, the Board felt that the more proper forum for that discussion was before the Zoning Board of Adjustment where sworn testimony by expert witnesses would be provided and where specific conditions could potentially be placed on its operation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">In language similar to the declarations of policy underlying federal and state legislation, the stated purpose of the Ordinance is \u201cto balance the need to control and regulate billboards, promote and preserve the scenic beauty and character of the Township, provide for the safety and convenience of the public, and to recognize certain Constitutional rights relative to outdoor advertising.\u201d The Ordinance permits a conditional use of static billboards in an area approximately 2000 feet long fronting on 1-287 in the M-2 zone, but prohibits all digital and electronic billboards: <footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-6\">No billboard or billboard display area or portion thereof shall rotate, move, produce noise or smoke, give the illusion of movement, display video or other changing imagery, automatically change, or be animated or blinking, <em>nor shall any billboard or portion thereof have any electronic, digital, tri-vision or other animated characteristics resulting in an automatically changing depiction.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b528-7\">[Franklin Twp., N.J., Ordinance 3875-10 \u00a7 112 \u2014 53.1(c)(3) (2010) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">Both the Ordinance and <em>N.J.AC. </em>16:41C-8.7(b)(3) require a minimum of 1000 feet between billboards. Since the M-2 zone fronting 1-287 is approximately 2000 feet long, the net result is that the Ordinance permitted the construction of three static billboards in that area. Because <em>N.J AC. </em>16:41 C-8.8(a)(5) re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>quires a minimum of 3000 feet between multiple message signs, only one digital billboard would be permitted in the Township if the ban against electronic and digital billboards was eliminated from the Ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">When the Board began to consider the adoption of an ordinance governing billboards in 2008, E &amp; J applied to NJDOT pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>27:5-8 for a permit to erect an electronic multimessage billboard for off-site advertising on its property, which is located in the M-2 zone, with 389 feet fronting on the north side of 1-287. This is an industrial district, across from a cemetery, adjacent to a large manufacturing facility with land to the rear zoned for further large manufacturing or warehouse uses. The proposed electronic billboard was oriented to 1-287. A residential development lies across the highway, with the closest home approximately 500 feet away from the proposed sign. The proposed billboard consisted of two panels measuring 48\u2019 by 14\u2019 each, arranged in a V-shape for visibility to both the northbound and southbound lanes of 1-287. The electronic panels would display static images in eight-second intervals without scrolling, flashing, or animation.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-8\">After the permit was issued by NJDOT in May 2009, the proposed electronic billboard remained subject to the Township\u2019s zoning ordinances. <em>N.J.S.A. </em>27:5-9.1. The Township had not yet adopted the Ordinance at issue here. In September 2009, E &amp; J applied to the Board of Adjustment for a use variance under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-70(d)(l). Hearings on E &amp; J\u2019s application were held on February 4, April 1, and June 3, 2010. The Ordinance was adopted prior to the last hearing. E &amp; J then amended its application to request a variance pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>40:55D-70(d)(3) (the D-3 variance) to permit construction of the electronic billboard. The Board of Adjustment denied its application.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">E &amp; J filed a four-count complaint in lieu of prerogative writs, alleging the prohibition of digital billboards in the M-2 zone violated both the First Amendment and the Equal Protection <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. E &amp; J did not challenge any other restriction contained in the Ordinance. In addition, the complaint alleged the Board had acted arbitrarily, capriciously and unreasonably in denying its application for a variance, and that the Township acted ultra vires in adopting the Ordinance.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">At the bench trial that followed, evidence was presented about the character of the Township. Approximately forty-seven square miles, Franklin Township is the second largest municipality in Somerset County. It is a highly diverse community that includes urban, suburban, rural, and economic development areas. 1-287 runs through the northwest section of the Township, passing through the M-2 industrial zone where large corporate structures and manufacturing facilities are located. However, over forty percent of the Township is zoned for very low density and over 8,000 acres are publicly or privately preserved.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-7\">John T. Chadwick, IV, E &amp; J\u2019s planning expert, testified, \u201cThe town has been very aggressive in preserving farmland and acquiring open space.\u201d However, Chadwick opined that the prohibition of any digital billboard in the zone would not advance the unique beauty and character of the Township because the particular zone was an industrial district, rather than a rural or historic neighborhood, and because the closest home is 500 feet across the highway.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">Jonathan Slass, a principal of E &amp; J, testified that the digital billboard would serve traditional advertisers, small businesses, political advertisers, and nonprofit organizations. In addition, a block of time would be controlled by the Township for public service announcements as police emergencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">Among the other witnesses E &amp; J presented, an employee of a digital sign manufacturer testified about the safety of digital billboards and the advantage of being able to instantly change messages to serve the public interest. A licensed professional engineer testified there was \u201cno conclusive evidence to suggest <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>that digital billboards relate to an increase in accidents or have a direct correlation on [sic] driver safety.\u201d On cross-examination, the engineer admitted the methodology of the studies she relied upon has been subject to criticism.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">Testifying as an expert in planning for the Township, Healey stated the Ordinance was adopted to update the Township\u2019s signage regulations and create a comprehensive regulation of outdoor advertising while preserving the Township\u2019s community character and aesthetics. Healey testified that the ban on digital billboards was consistent with the intent to preserve the Township\u2019s character for several reasons: (1) digital billboards tend to be brighter and have an appearance of being much more crisp in resolution; (2) the Township had a reasonable concern about having a digital billboard of almost 700 square feet at a gateway into the township; and (3) since the Ordinance would permit three billboards in the M-2 zone, there could be two static billboards in the M-2 zone in addition to a digital billboard if the ban was invalidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">In response to the argument that a digital billboard would provide a means of instantly communicating emergency messages, Healey testified that the Township had the ability to do so without the use of digital billboards. There are two signs on the stretch of land along 1-287, placed by NJDOT, that have been used for Amber Alert and Silver Alert messages. In contrast to the size and characteristics of the proposed digital billboard, the signs are less than 100 feet square, with an amber color display on a black background and do not scroll. In addition, the Township has a \u201creverse 9-1-1\u201d calling system it uses to alert residents when there is flooding. Residents are also able to sign up to receive \u201cemail blasts\u201d from the Township when necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">The trial judge concluded that the Township\u2019s decision to deny E &amp; J\u2019s application for a D-3 variance to erect the digital billboard was not arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable. The trial judge also rejected E &amp; J\u2019s equal protection argument, finding that the Township had demonstrated a rational basis for the distinction <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>between digital and static billboards. Citing <em>Greenberg v. Kim-melman, </em>99 <em>N.J. 552, </em>563, 494 A.2d 294 (1985), the judge stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b532-4\">The Township\u2019s concern with the impact of digital billboards on community aesthetics, as well as the lack of conclusive evidence regarding the impact of the billboards on traffic safety, provides at least some rational basis for enactment of the ban <em>on </em>digital billboards. While plaintiff asserts that the evidence indicates no such impact is likely to occur, it cannot be denied that digital billboards, at minimum, create visual stimuli different than that of a traditional billboard. By the mere fact that the images change, there is the chance that the digital billboard could possibly impact community aesthetics or traffic safety.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">Despite these findings, the trial judge invalidated \u00a7 112-53.1(e)(3) of the Ordinance, concluding that the digital billboard ban violated the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">In its appeal, the Township argues that the trial court erred in applying an intermediate scrutiny standard to the Ordinance and that, instead, the court should have determined whether the Township\u2019s adoption of the Ordinance was arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable. Alternatively, the Township argues that because the ordinance is content-neutral, it should be reviewed pursuant to the time, place, and manner standard set forth in <em>Ward v. Rock Against Racism, </em>491 <em>U.S. </em>781, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>2746, 105 L.Ed.2d 661 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">Because this appeal calls for our review of the \u201ctrial court\u2019s interpretation of the law and the legal consequences that flow from established facts,\u201d we conduct a de novo review. <em>Manalapan Realty v. Twp. Comm, of Manalapan, </em>140 <em>N.J. </em>366, 378, 658 A.2d 1230 (1995). We agree with the trial court that a time, place, and manner review is appropriate here. But, we part company with the trial court in its reliance upon <em>Bell. </em>Although the language used is similar to that of the test identified in <em>Clark v. Community for Creative Non-Violence, </em>468 <em>U.S. </em>288, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>3065, 82 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>221 (1984), the trial court\u2019s application, relying upon <em>Bell, </em>required the Township to meet standards not required in the review of content-neutral time, place and manner restrictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>V</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">The Township\u2019s argument that the Ordinance enjoyed a presumption of validity that could only be overcome by evidence that its regulation was arbitrary, capricious, or unreasonable lacks merit because \u201cthe regulation of billboards implicates fundamental First Amendment rights.\u201d <em>CBS Outdoor, Inc. v. Borough of Lebanon Planning Bd./Bd. of Adjustment, </em>414 <em>N.J.Super. </em>563, 587, 999 A.2d 1151 (App.Div.2010). Our view is in harmony with federal precedent.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cBillboards are a well-established medium of communication\u201d that have both \u201ccommunicative and noncommunicative aspects.\u201d <em>Metromedia, supra, </em>453 <em>U.S. </em>at 501-02, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2889-90, 69 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 811 (plurality opinion). \u201c[T]he government has legitimate interests in controlling the noncommunicative aspects of the medium, but the First and Fourteenth Amendments foreclose a similar interest in controlling the communicative aspects.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 502, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2890, 69 L.Ed.2d at 811 (citation omitted). \u201cBecause regulation of the noncommunicative aspects of a medium often impinges to some degree on the communicative aspects, it has been necessary for the courts to reconcile the government\u2019s regulatory interests with the individual\u2019s right to expression.\u201d <em>Ibid.; see also Ladue, supra, </em>512 <em>U.S. </em>at 48, 114 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2042, 129 L.Ed.2d at 43. We conduct \u201ca particularized inquiry into the nature of the conflicting interests at stake here, beginning with a precise appraisal of the character of the ordi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>nance as it affects communication.\u201d <em>Metromedia, supra, </em>453 <em>U.S. </em>at 503,101 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2890, 69 L.Ed.2d at 812.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">As we have noted, the Ordinance did not ban all billboards, only one feature of billboards that is unrelated to the content of any message. To be precise, the practical effect of the ban was to prohibit electronic multi-messaging on a single billboard in the Township. In sum, it is essentially undisputed that a \u201ctime, place or manner\u201d analysis is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">VI</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">Under the applicable standard, time, place or manner restrictions are valid, provided they satisfy three criteria: (1) they \u201care justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech,\u201d (2) \u201cthey are narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest,\u201d and (3) \u201cthey leave open ample alternative channels for communication of the information.\u201d <em>Ward, supra, 491 US. </em>at 791, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2753, 105 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 675; <em>Clark, supra, </em>468 <em>U.S. </em>at 293, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3069, 82 L.Ed.2d at 227; <em>see also McCullen v.

Instead, the court relied heavily upon our Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Bell, </em>and concluded that the Township had failed to supply \u201ca factual basis demonstrating that the Ordinance\u2019s ban on only digital/electronic billboards serves a legitimate government interest and is narrowly drawn to advance its government interests.\u201d The trial court\u2019s reliance upon <em>Bell </em>was misplaced on both legal and factual grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>The ordinance in <em>Bell </em>created a township-wide ban on billboards. In contrast, here, the Township has not banned all billboards. In addition to those billboards erected before it was adopted, the Ordinance permits the erection of three billboards in the M-2 zone. As we have noted, there has been no challenge to the Ordinance on the ground that it unreasonably limits the number or location of billboards.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">Unlike the explicit statements of reasons for the Township\u2019s action here, borne out by a supporting history, the challenged ordinance in <em>Bell </em>failed to reveal any \u201cgovernmental objectives or its factual underpinnings,\u201d and the record was \u201calmost completely devoid of any evidence concerning what interests of Stafford are served by the ordinance and the extent to which the ordinance has advanced those interests.\u201d 110 <em>N.J. </em>at 396, 541 A.2d 692. Because the ordinance encroached upon a fundamental right, the Court rejected the municipality\u2019s argument that its ordinance was entitled to a presumption of validity, and analyzed the constitutionality of the ordinance based upon its total prohibition of a form of expression. <em>Id. </em>at 395-96, 541 A.2d 692.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-7\">It is also telling that <em>Bell </em>did not engage in an analysis of a content-neutral time, place, and manner restriction on expression pursuant to the standard applied in both <em>Clark, supra, </em>468 <em>U.S. </em>at 293, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3069, 82 <em>L.Ed. </em>2d at 227, and <em>City Council of Los Angeles v.

Instead, the Court applied the <em>Central </em>Hudson<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> test relied upon by the plurality in <em>Metromedia </em>which governs the review of restrictions on commercial speech that are <em>not </em>content-neutral. <em>Bell, supru, </em>110 <em>N.J. </em>at 392-98, 541 A.2d 692. The four-part <em>Central Hudson </em>test <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>requires that (1) the commercial speech \u201cmust concern lawful activity and not be misleading,\u201d (2) the asserted governmental interest must be substantial, (3) the regulation must \u201cdirectly advance[ ] the governmental interest asserted,\u201d and (4) the regulation must not be \u201cmore extensive than is necessary to serve that interest.\u201d <em>Cent. Hudson, supra, </em>447 <em>U.S. </em>at 566,100 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2351, 65 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 351.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">However, when the government regulates \u201cfeatures of speech unrelated to its content,\u201d it is afforded \u201csomewhat wider leeway.\u201d <em>McCullen, supra, </em>- <em>U.S. </em>at-, 134 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2529, 189 L.Ed.2d at 514. The level of scrutiny we apply depends on whether the restriction is a content-neutral regulation of the time, place, or manner of the speech or whether it is a restriction on the content of the speech itself. <em>See id. </em>at-, 134 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2529,189 L.Ed.2d at 514-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">Since <em>Bell, </em>our courts have recognized that the standard governing the regulation of commercial speech<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> that is not content-neutral and the standard applicable to time, place, and manner restrictions, are often \u201cclosely intertwined,\u201d and have even applied both tests simultaneously. <em>See Hamilton Amusement Ctr., supra, </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>at 268, 716 A.2d 1137 (citing <em>City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. </em>41, 46, 54-55, 106 <em>S.Ct. </em>925, 928, 932, 89 L.Ed.2d 29, 37, 42 (1986)); <em>N.J. Dep\u2019t. of Labor &amp; Workforce Dev. v. Crest Ultrasonics, </em>434 <em>N.J.Super. </em>34, 38, 82 A.3d 258 (App.Div.2014). The analyses in these cases support our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>conclusion that the trial court\u2019s interpretation imposed a burden on the Township that is not required for content-neutral restrictions on time, place, and manner expression. We therefore conduct a de novo review of the application of the <em>Ward </em>test to the Ordinance here.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-6\">A</p>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">Because there is no serious issue that the restriction here is content-neutral, the first prong of the <em>Ward </em>test is satisfied. <em>Ward, supra, </em>491 <em>U.S. </em>at 791, 109 <em>S.Ct </em>at 2754, 105 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 675. However, because that factor weighs heavily in the analysis, further discussion is merited.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">Government regulation of expressive activity is content-neutral so long as it is \u201cjustified without reference to the content of the regulated speech.\u201d <em>Clark, supra, </em>468 <em>U.S. </em>at 293, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3069, 82 L.Ed.2d at 227. The government\u2019s purpose in adopting the regulation is \u201cthe controlling consideration\u201d in determining content neutrality. <em>Ward, supra, </em>491 <em>U.S. </em>at 791, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2754, 105 L.Ed.2d at 675. \u201cThe principal inquiry ... is whether the government has adopted a regulation of speech because of disagreement with the message it conveys.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>When the regulation \u201cserves purposes unrelated to the content of expression,\u201d it is \u201cdeemed neutral, even if it has an incidental effect on some speakers or messages but not others.\u201d <em>Ibid.; see also Besler, supra, </em>201 <em>N.J. </em>at 570-71, 993 A.2d 805; <em>Hamilton Amusement Ctr., supra, </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>at 268, 716 A.2d 1137.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">On its face, the Ordinance does not restrict any speech based on its content. The restriction at issue applies with equal force, regardless of the content of the speech. E &amp; J did not argue and the trial court did not find that the Township\u2019s motivation in adopting the Ordinance was anything other than its stated interests in aesthetics and traffic safety. Although the trial court concluded that those interests were not sufficiently advanced by the digital billboard ban, it is undisputed that the Township\u2019s purpose, the \u201ccontrolling consideration,\u201d <em>Ward, supra, </em>491 <em>U.S. </em>at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>791, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2754, 105 L.Ed.2d at 675, was to serve its interests in aesthetics and traffic safety. The Ordinance plainly meets the definition of a content-neutral regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">Further, the restriction relates only to the format in which the communication is delivered \u2014 by way of a digital billboard as opposed to a static billboard. Even if the digital delivery system may be considered \u201cexpressive and part of the message delivered,\u201d the regulation remains a restriction on the manner of expression, <em>see Clark, supra, </em>468 <em>U.S. </em>at 294, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3069, 82 L.Ed.2d at 227-28, and is therefore governed by the standard applicable to restrictions on the time, place, or manner of expression.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">E &amp; J agrees that a time, place and manner analysis applies here. However, somewhat incongruously, it also contends that the ban on digital billboards \u201cconstitutes a non-content neutral restriction on plaintiffs planned and non-commercial speech,\u201d and \u201cdiscriminate[s] between forms of non-commercial speech.\u201d In support of the latter argument, E &amp; J states that while certain noncommercial messages could be adequately presented on a static billboard, emergency public service announcements such as Amber Alerts cannot be communicated through that medium.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-7\">E &amp; J\u2019s effort to elevate the ban on digital billboards to a content related restriction lacks any merit. As we have noted, a restriction on speech that serves purposes unrelated to the content of the speech is \u201cdeemed neutral, even if it has an incidental effect on some speakers or messages but not others.\u201d <em>Ward, supra, </em>491 <em>U.S. at </em>791,109 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2754,105 L.Ed.2d at 675.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">Moreover, \u201cthe First Amendment does not guarantee the right to employ every conceivable method of communication at all times and in all places.\u201d <em>Vincent, supra, </em>466 <em>U.S. </em>at 812,104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2132, 80 L.Ed.2d at 791 (citing <em>Heffron v. Int\u2019l Soc. for Krishna Consciousness, </em>452 <em>U.S. </em>640, 647, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>2559, 2564, 69 L.Ed.2d 298, 306 (1981)). In <em>Clark, </em>demonstrators who wanted <em>to call </em>attention to the plight of the homeless challenged a ban on sleeping in national parks. 468 <em>US. </em>at 289, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3067, 82 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>L.Ed.2d at 224. Rejecting their constitutional claim, the Court stated, \u201cThat sleeping ... may be expressive and part of the message delivered by the demonstration does not make the ban any less a limitation on the manner of demonstrating, for reasonable time, place, or manner regulations normally have the purpose and direct effect of limiting expression but are nevertheless valid.\u201d <em>Clark, supra, </em>468 <em>U.S. </em>at 294,104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 3069, 82 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 227-28. In <em>Vincent, supra, </em>466 <em>U.S. </em>at 810, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2131, 80 L.Ed,.2d at 790, the challenged ordinance also prohibited a \u201cmedium of expression,\u201d the posting of signs on public property. In upholding the constitutionality of the ordinance, the Supreme Court stated, \u201cit is the tangible medium of expressing the message that has the adverse impact on the appearance of the landscape .... [T]he substantive evil \u2014 visual blight \u2014 is not merely a possible byproduct of the activity, but is created by the medium of expression itself.\u201d <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b539-6\">Here, the Township justifies its prohibition of digital billboards based on its interest in aesthetics and traffic safety, \u201cwithout reference to the content of the regulated speech.\u201d <em>See Ward, supra, </em>491 <em>U.S. </em>at 791, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2753, 105 L.Ed.2d at 675. Even if the use of an electronic multi-message is considered a form of expression, the incidental effect of the Ordinance\u2019s ban on announcements to be communicated in eight-second segments does not strip the Ordinance of its content neutrality. We therefore turn to the remaining criteria and their application here.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-7\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b539-8\">The second prong of the <em>Ward </em>test is that the regulation must be \u201cnarrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest.\u201d <em>Ward, supra, </em>491 <em>U.S. </em>at 791,109 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2753, 105 L.Ed.2d at 675. This requires us to determine first, whether there is such a governmental interest and second, whether the regulation is \u201cnarrowly tailored\u201d to serve that interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-9\">The burden of proving a \u201csubstantial government interest\u201d is not a heavy one. <em>Hamilton Amusement Ctr., supra, </em>156 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number><em>N.J. </em>at 270-71, 716 A.2d 1137.

To satisfy this burden, the evidence must \u201cprovide a rational, objective basis from which a reviewing court can ascertain the existence of a substantial governmental interest underpinning the legislation,\u201d <em>Twp. of Cinnaminson v.

Such support may come in the form of \u201creference to studies pertaining to other jurisdictions, legislative history, consensus, and even common sense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 271, 716 A.2d 1137.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">The government interests identified here were aesthetics and traffic safety. It is universally recognized that government has a legitimate, even substantial, interest in preserving the aesthetics of its community and in promoting traffic safety. <em>See Metromedia, supra, </em>453 <em>U.S. </em>at 507-08, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2892, 69 L.Ed.2d at 815 (noting that \u201ctraffic safety and the appearance of the city ... are substantial governmental goals\u201d). Further, there is little dispute that billboards, of any type, are widely considered to have a negative impact upon aesthetics and traffic safety. <em>See Vincent, supra, </em>466 <em>U.S. </em>at 808, 104 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2130-31, 80 L.Ed.2d at 789 (stating it is not speculative to recognize that posted signs, like billboards, can be perceived as an \u201cesthetic harm\u201d); <em>Metromedia, supra, </em>453 <em>U.S. </em>at 508-09, 101 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2893, 69 L.Ed.2d at 815-16 (stating \u201cas a matter of law that an ordinance which eliminates billboards designed to be viewed from streets and highways reasonably relates to traffic safety\u201d); Susan C.

City of Concord, </em>513 F.3d 27, 34 (1st Cir.2008) (finding that the city\u2019s \u201cstated justifications plainly constitute significant governmental interests\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">Turning to the evidence relied upon by the Township, we note the record includes repeated statements from the Environmental Commission of its concerns regarding the glare from billboards onto residential properties and its urging that billboards not be visible from residential properties. Healey\u2019s recommendations to the Board regarding locations for billboards reflected concern as to whether placement \u201cwould significantly detract from community character,\u201d or have little effect because of existing conditions at the site.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Healey also testified that specific attributes of digital billboards, such as their increased crispness and brightness, and the possible placement with additional static billboards, were relevant to the decision to adopt a ban. The Township also offered excerpts from the NJDOT, Bureau of Safety Programs, <em>Summary of Crash Rates on State and Interstate Highways in Route and Milepost Order </em>for 2006 through 2009;<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Jerry Wach<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>tel, <em>A Critical, Comprehensive Review of Two Studies Recently Released by the Outdoor Advertising Association of America </em>(Final Report 2007), and excerpts from a publication of the United States Department of Transportation, <em>The Effects of Commercial Electronic Variable Message Signs (CEVMS) on Driver Attention and Distraction: An Update, Federal Highway Administration, </em>Publication Number FHWA-HRT-09-018 (2009) <em>(USDOT Report ).</em><footnotemark>11</footnotemark> The last of these studies concluded it was important to conduct \u201ccarefully controlled and methodologically sound\u201d research because the available studies were inconclusive in \u201cdemonstrating detrimental driver safety effects due to CEVMS exposure.\u201d <em>USDOT Report </em>at 7.0 Conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">The recognized need for further studies on the impact of such billboards, along with the Township\u2019s stated reasons, provides a rational, objective basis for the Township\u2019s decision to refrain from adopting a regulation of them. In all, the record establishes that the Township relied on evidence \u201creasonably believed to be relevant to\u201d the interest identified in the Ordinance\u2019s stated purpose. <em>See Hamilton Amusement Ctr., supra, </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>at 270, 716 A.2d 1137. It is further evident from the Ordinance\u2019s declaration of purpose, its drafting history and the proofs presented at trial that the Township\u2019s stated interests in the regulation here were authentic and not a subterfuge for an improperly motivated restriction on expression. We are satisfied that the Township presented adequate proof of a substantial government interest for the regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Under the <em>Ward </em>standard our Supreme Court applies, there are two components to the \u201cnarrowly tailoring\u201d requirement: (1) the regulation must promote a substantial government interest that would be achieved less effectively without the regulation, and (2) the restriction must not \u201cburden substantially more speech than is necessary to further\u201d the State\u2019s content-neutral interest. <em>Ward, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number><em>supra, </em>491 <em>U.S. </em>at 798-800, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2757-58, 105 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 680-81.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">The government\u2019s determination as to whether a content-neutral regulation \u201cpromotes a substantial government interest\u201d will ordinarily be entitled to our deference. \u2018\u201cThe validity of [time, place, or manner] regulations does not turn on a judge\u2019s agreement with the responsible decisionmaker concerning the most appropriate method for promoting significant government interests\u2019 or the degree to which those interests should be promoted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 800, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2758, 105 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 681 (quoting <em>United States v.

Government may not regulate expression in such a manner that a substantial portion of the burden on speech does not serve to advance its goals.

The ban on digital billboards was no broader than was <em>necessary </em>to eliminate that heightened intrusive quality. Moreover, the ban was adopted within an Ordinance that permitted billboards in the Township under conditions not otherwise challenged here. The record here shows that the Township <em>clearly </em>stated its objectives for the Ordinance, that it considered the concerns expressed and information received during the deliberative process, and that other provisions in the Ordinance serve the same objectives of traffic safety and aesthetics. These facts all support the conclusion that the ban on digital billboards \u201crepresents a reasoned compromise between serving the [Township\u2019s] asserted goals and allowing some\u201d billboards in the Township. <em>See Hamilton Amusement Ctr., supra, </em>156 <em>N.J. </em>at 278-79, 716 A.2d 1137. We are therefore satisfied that the second prong was met.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">C</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">The third prong requires that the restrictions imposed by the regulation \u201cleave open ample alternative channels for communication of the information.\u201d <em>Ward, supra, </em>491 <em>U.S. </em>at 791, 109 <em>S.Ct. </em>at 2753, 105 <em>L.Ed.2d </em>at 675. <em>See also Heffiron v.

To assess the adequacy of remaining modes of communication, we focus upon the advantage of the restricted means of expression and determine whether \u201cthese same advantages cannot be obtained through other means.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">The advantage to an electronic multi-message billboard is that a message may be posted or changed in short order. E &amp; J admits that the lion\u2019s share of the commercial speech to be projected on its proposed billboard does not require this advantage. The only type of message identified as being adversely affected by the loss of this advantage is emergency public service announcements. Healey testified that other means were available to satisfy this need. Signs posted by NJDOT on 1-287 were used to provide Amber alerts and Silver alerts; the Township has a \u201creverse 9-1-1\u201d calling system and a system for sending \u201cemail blasts\u201d to residents when necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">The means identified by Healey may reasonably be viewed as comparable to that provided by digital billboards in providing public service information on an emergent basis. And, because the audience who can receive communications through the proposed digital billboard is limited to motorists on a limited stretch of 1-287, the alternative means are clearly superior in terms of their ability to reach the residents of the Township. We therefore conclude that \u201cample alternative channels for communication of the information\u201d are left available by the Ordinance, satisfying the third prong of the <em>Ward </em>test.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b524-8\"> Various terms, such as digital, LED, electronic, multi-message, and Commercial Electronic Variable Message Signs (CEVMS), are used to describe the nature of the billboards subject to the Ordinance's prohibition.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b525-8\"> In enacting the Federal Highway Beautification Act, 23 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>131, Congress declared its finding that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-9\">the erection and maintenance of outdoor advertising signs, displays, and devices in areas adjacent to the Interstate System and the primary system should be controlled in order to protect the public investment in such highways, <em>to promote the safety and recreational value of public travel, and to preserve natural beauty.</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-10\">[23 <em>U.S.C.A. </em>\u00a7 131(a) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b525-11\"> The Legislature described its purpose in enacting the Roadside Sign Control and Outdoor Advertising Act (Roadside Sign Act), <em>N.J.S.A. 27:5-5 </em>to -28, as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-12\">In order to balance <em>the promotion of the safety, </em>convenience and enjoyment of travel on the highways of this State with the protection of the recreational value and public investment therein, <em>to preserve and enhance the natural scenic beauty and aesthetic features of the highways and adjacent areas </em>while promoting development and economic vitality and facilitating the flow of speech and expression, of which providing messages of commercial, public and social value conveyed through the medium of roadside signs and outdoor advertising is an important part, roadside signs and outdoor advertising shall be regulated by this act.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b525-13\">[N.J.S.A. 27:5-6(a) (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b528-9\"> The Ordinance contains other restrictions relevant to aesthetics and traffic safety.
