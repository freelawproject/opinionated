S.I. challenges the trial judge\u2019s factual findings, as well as her application of the law to the facts. Specifically, S.I. disputes: (1) the single act of withholding her consent for the mental health evaluation demonstrated medical neglect; (2) she failed to exercise a minimum degree of care by withholding her consent for the evaluation; and (3) the child suffered or was at imminent risk of suffering harm because she withheld her consent.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-10\">We have considered the arguments advanced by the parties. Although we find no fault with the Division\u2019s initial decision to remove the child to effectuate a mental health evaluation, we conclude the record lacks substantial credible evidence that S.I.\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"147\">*147</page-number>conduct amounted to medical neglect or recklessly created a substantial risk to the child\u2019s mental health or physical safety. <em>N.J. Div. of Youth Family Servs. v. A.L., </em>213 <em>N.J. </em>1, 59 A.3d 576 (2013). Accordingly, we reverse the finding of abuse or neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">These facts are taken from the April 5, 2012 fact-finding hearing. During the hearing the State presented testimonial evidence from two Division workers and admitted, without objection, documents evidencing the initial referral and the Division\u2019s investigation. S.I. testified in her own behalf.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">A school nurse contacted the Division after a note written by S.l.\u2019s then twelve-year-old grandchild was discovered, which stated: \u201cI want to kill myself. I hate my life.\u201d When confronted, the child explained she wrote the note more than a month earlier, but admitted being depressed. She stated she \u201cha[d] no plan on how she\u2019s going to hurt herself.\u201d Further, the child expressed fear of S.I., complaining her grandmother hits her in the back \u201conce per week.\u201d The child insisted she did not want to return to S.l.\u2019s care.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">A mobile crisis unit was contacted. The record states a response team went to the school, but does not include the results of the child\u2019s evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">The school\u2019s vice principal contacted S.I. asking her to come to the school. S.I. complied. When told of the discovered note, S.I. did not believe the child was suicidal or desired to end her life. The vice principal informed the Division S.I. became \u201cextremely upset\u201d after the child\u2019s comments were disclosed and she \u201ccould not be calmed.\u201d S.I. insisted the child was acting out after being punished. She repeatedly denied the child\u2019s allegations of physical abuse, and suggested the child was merely rebelling. S.I. declined the recommendation she take the child to the hospital for a mental health evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"148\">*148</page-number>The vice principal advised the Division worker when he told S.I. the child feared returning home, S.I. responded \u201cShe don\u2019t want me. I don\u2019t want her.\u201d S.I. then left the school without the child. Subsequent calls by the vice principal to S.I. went unanswered. The school called the Division after S.I. left the school.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\">Division Special Response Unit (SPRU) worker Pedro Cere\u00f1o responded to the school. He interviewed the child, who said she disliked school because classmates bullied her, called her names and made fun of her appearance. The child complained S.I. yells at her, which causes \u201cfeelings of depression\u201d and \u201cshe would rather be dead than go through these things.\u201d Although the child did not have a plan to harm herself, she feared returning home as \u201cshe d[id] not feel safe.\u201d Finally, the child expressed she had limited contact with her parents.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-5\">Following unanswered calls to S.I., Cere\u00f1o traveled to her home. The child remained in the school building with another SPRU worker.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-6\">Cere\u00f1o spoke to S.I. regarding the note found by school officials and urged her to take the child to the hospital for a psychiatric evaluation. S.I. declined, stating the child was being manipulative as \u201cshe ha[d] not gotten her way.\u201d S.I. explained the child was spoiled and accustomed to getting what she wanted; however, S.I. had lost her job and the family could no longer afford to spend money as before. S.I. characterized the child\u2019s conduct as reflective of her rebellion because she had \u201cbehavioral issues.\u201d Finally, S.I. remarked she was being treated for depression as a result of her own circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-7\">S.I. vehemently denied the child\u2019s claims of physical abuse and the use of corporal punishment. S.I.\u2019s daughter, who also lived in the home, confirmed the child was not physically abused.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-8\">After Cere\u00f1o again discussed the need to take the child to the hospital, S.I. insisted it was unnecessary and stated she refused to \u201cplay into [the child\u2019s] manipulation.\u201d S.I. additionally stated she <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>did not want to go to the hospital for fear her own depression might trigger an anxiety attack.</p>\n<p id=\"b177-6\">Cere\u00f1o explained if S.I. continued to refuse, the Division would be required to remove the child to obtain the evaluation. S.I. suggested the Division should \u201cassume custody of the child because she wasn\u2019t taking the child to the hospital.\u201d Cere\u00f1o also testified S.I. \u201cremained adamant of the fact that if the child didn\u2019t want to be in the home, that she was not going to have her there.\u201d Cere\u00f1o then offered to provide homemaker services for the household, but S.I. responded: \u201cHell [n]o.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-7\">S.I. refused to sign the notice of emergency removal. Consequently, the Division effected a Dodd removal and assumed the child\u2019s temporary care, custody, and supervision.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The child was immediately taken to Jersey City Medical Center for a psychological evaluation, where she \u201cwas screened, not deemed a risk and ... released.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b177-8\">Sarah Overholser, the caseworker who assumed responsibility for the case after the child was removed, also testified. She stated the Division\u2019s investigation revealed the child\u2019s claims of physical abuse by S.I. were \u201cunfounded.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The Division also communicat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>ed with the child\u2019s parents, who expressed they maintained regular contact with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-4\">5.1. testified regarding her meeting with school officials and her interview by the Division. She stated the vice principal declined her requests to talk to the child when she did not want to return home. S.I. asked what she should do and what the school was going to do, but the vice principal just \u201cshrugged\u201d; so she left. She insisted the vice principal never stated the child needed a psychiatric evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b178-5\">In speaking with Cere\u00f1o, S.I. related she lost her job and \u201chad gotten very ill with depression\u201d and \u201chad basically a breakdown.\u201d 5.1. explained her depression and anxiety caused her to become \u201cmixed-up,\u201d \u201coverwhelm[ed],\u201d and unable to adequately explain her position or \u201cget [ ] Cere\u00f1o to understand\u201d her view of the child\u2019s behavioral concerns. S.I. stated the child was \u201cnot being abused physically or any other way.\u201d S.I. noted since her employment ended, she discovered the child\u2019s \u201cfailing grades [and] horrible attitude toward her aunts.\u201d S.I. started to address these issues with the child, who reacted by \u201ccrying and ranting and raving.\u201d S.I. believed the child\u2019s comments, as related by the vice principal, showed she was \u201cacting out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b178-7\">5.1. professed she loved the child, denied stating she did not want her, and insisted she wanted what was best for her. She steadfastly asserted the child would \u201cnever have committed suicide.\u201d Rather, she suggested the child \u201cwas being vindictive\u201d because a few days earlier S.I. had forbade the child from attending the local Boys and Girls Club until her grades improved. 5.1. believed the child was \u201cjust a teenager acting out because she was failing and I wanted her to redirect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b178-9\">5.1. also related she feared going to the hospital because of her own depression and anxiety. She asserted her daughter offered to take the child to the hospital, but Cere\u00f1o would not permit the aunt to accompany the child to the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>At the conclusion of the hearing, the judge entered her oral opinion. She found S.I. was \u201ca very intelligent, obviously well-educated woman\u201d and recognized the difficulty associated with being and raising a teenage girl. However, she found S.I. refused to take the child for a mental health assessment when \u201c[cjlearly the child was in probable danger of having some kind of a serious mental episode.\u201d Addressing S.I.\u2019s explanation of the child\u2019s behavior, the judge commented:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-6\">whether [the child\u2019s behavior] was just for attention or whether it was really serious, that\u2019s not [a decision] for the caregiver to make____ [T]hat\u2019s for the experts. That\u2019s for the people in the Medical Center or wherever who will sit down and do mental testing on someone to make sure that they are not a danger to themselves.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-9\">The judge related concerns for teenage suicide, the emotional turmoil caused by bullying, and a young person\u2019s inability to fully appreciate the consequences of his or her actions and the possibility of change in the future, stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-10\">[W]ould she have done it? Nobody knows that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b179-11\">But as the caregiver, do you have the obligation to do everything that you can to make sure that this child will not harm herself? You bet you do.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b179-12\">The judge determined S.I. \u201cwas obligated to take this child for a medical health assessment after [she] had threatened suicide and she refused to do so.\u201d S.I. received specific instructions regarding how to address the issue, but refused to comply. Accordingly, the judge determined the Division established by a preponderance of the evidence that the child was \u201cabused or neglected\u201d and S.I.\u2019s failure to act amounted to medical neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-13\">After dispositional hearings, the child was placed in the legal and physical custody of her father, and the litigation was terminated. S.I. filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b179-14\">S.I. argues the trial judge erred in finding the Division met its burden to show medical neglect by a preponderance of the evidence as the judge\u2019s factual findings were not supported by adequate, substantial, and credible evidence in the record. S.I. urges the findings of abuse or neglect cannot be sustained solely because she disagreed with the Division\u2019s recommendation that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>the child needed a mental health evaluation. Moreover, she contends a single instance of allegedly blocking suggested care does not rise to the level of gross negligence or reckless disregard for the child\u2019s safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b180-5\">Our standard of review on appeal is narrow. We defer to the Family Part\u2019s findings of fact based on those findings. N.J. <em>Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. G.L., </em>191 <em>N.J. </em>596, 605, 926 A.2d 320 (2007). \u201c[Findings by the trial judge are considered binding on appeal when supported by adequate, substantial and credible evidence.\u201d <em>N.J.

Co. of Am., </em>65 <em>N.J. </em>474, 484, 323 A.2d 495 (1974)). Deference to a trial court\u2019s supported factual findings is warranted because the trial judge \u201chas the opportunity to make first-hand credibility judgments about the witnesses who appear on the stand [and] ... has a \u2018feel of the case\u2019 that can never be realized by a review of the cold record.\u201d <em>N.J. Div. of Youth &amp; Family Servs. v. E.P., </em>196 <em>N.J. </em>88, 104, 952 A.2d 436 (2008). Nevertheless, \u201c[w]here the issue to be decided is an \u2018alleged error in the trial judge\u2019s evaluation of the underlying facts and the implications to be drawn therefrom,\u2019 we expand the scope of our review.\u201d G.L., <em>supra, </em>191 <em>N.J. </em>at 605, 926 A.2d 320 (quoting <em>In re Guardianship of J.T., </em>269 <em>N.J.Super. </em>172, 188-89, 634 A.2d 1361 (App.Div.1993)). The trial judge\u2019s legal conclusions and the application of those conclusions to the facts are subject to plenary review. <em>Manalapan Realty, L.P. v. Twp.

Dep\u2019t of Human Servs., </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>161, 171, 723 A.2d 612 (1999) (citing <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.8). <em>See also N.J.S.A </em>9:6-8.21 to -8.73 (governing protection of abused and neglected children). \u201cThe statute in question addresses harm to a child[.]\u201d <em>A.L., supra, </em>213 <em>N.J. </em>at 8, 59 A.3d 576. An \u201cabused or neglected child\u201d is defined in <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.21(c) as</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b181-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>a child less than 18 years of age whose parent or guardian, as herein defined, ... or a child whose physical, mental, or emotional condition has been impaired or is in imminent danger of becoming impaired as the result of the failure of his parent or guardian, as herein defined, to exercise a minimum degree of care ... in supplying the child with adequate food, clothing, shelter, education, medical or surgical care though financially able to do so or though offered financial or other reasonable means to do so____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b181-6\">Whether a parent or guardian has engaged in acts of abuse or neglect is considered on a case-by-case basis and must be \u201c \u2018analyzed in light of the dangers and risks associated with the situation.\u2019 \u201d <em>N.J. Dep\u2019t of Children Families v. R.R., </em>436 <em>N.J.Super. </em>53, 58, 91 A.3d 651 (App.Div.2014) (quoting <em>G.S., supra, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>at 181-82, 723 A.2d 612). Under the statutory standard, \u201csomething more than ordinary negligence is required to hold the actor liable.\u201d <em>G.S., supra, </em>157 <em>N.J. </em>at 178, 723 A.2d 612. Proscribed is \u201cconduct that is grossly or wantonly negligent, but not necessarily intentional.\u201d <em>Ibid. </em>The standard \u201cimplies that a person has acted with reckless disregard for the safety of others.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 179, 723 A.2d 612. However, whether a particular event is mere negligence, as opposed to gross or wanton negligence, can be difficult to determine. <em>See N.J. Div. of Youth Family Servs. v. T.B., </em>207 <em>N.J. </em>294, 309, 24 A.3d 290 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b181-7\">A court considering whether a parent or guardian\u2019s conduct meets the statutory standard must analyze all facts, <em>N.J.

In this regard, \u201c[o]ne act may be substantial or the sum of many acts may be substantial\u201d to prove abuse or neglect. <em>Id. </em>at 320, 32 A.3d 578 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). A court need not wait until a child is actually harmed or neglected before it can act to address parental conduct adverse to a minor\u2019s welfare. <em>N.J. Div. of Youth Family Servs. v.

However, when \u201cthere is no evidence of actual harm, ... the statute requires a showing of <em>\u2018imminent </em>danger\u2019 or a <em>\u2018substantial </em>risk\u2019 of harm before a parent or guardian can be found to have abused or neglected a child.\u201d AL., <em>supra, </em>213 <em>N.J. </em>at 8, 59 A.3d 576 (citing <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.21(c)). If an isolated act \u201cappears to be aberrational,\u201d labeling the parent a child abuser may be inappropriate. <em>N.J. Div. of Youth Family Servs. v. K.A., </em>413 <em>N.J.Super. </em>504, 512-13, 996 A.2d 1040 (App. Div.2010), <em>certif. dismissed, </em>208 <em>N.J. </em>355, 28 A.3d 1244 (2011).</p>\n<p id=\"b182-7\">Guided by these principles we examine the facts in this matter. The issue presented is whether S.I.\u2019s refusal to take the child to the hospital for a psychiatric evaluation constituted a failure to exercise a minimum degree of care, recklessly creating \u201charm, or [the] substantial risk thereof[.]\u201d <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.21(c)(4)(b). A teenager\u2019s expression tantamount to thoughts of suicide should never be ignored by adults. However, the facts presented here are so limited we can only conclude this evidence fails to prove the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>child was in \u201cimminent danger\u201d or that a \u201csubstantial risk\u201d of harm would result from S.I.\u2019s refusal to seek immediate psychiatric review, which are prerequisites to sustain a finding of abuse or neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">The Division presented Cereno\u2019s report, which included the school\u2019s reaction to finding the child\u2019s note on December 8, 2011. The child admitted penning the note, sometime in October, possibly six to eight weeks earlier. The child stated she was depressed, but also affirmed she had no plans on how to harm herself. In his discussion with the child, Cere\u00f1o noted the child related poor relationships with her family members and alleged physical and verbal conflict with S.I.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">When confronted with the note stating the child \u201cwanted to kill herself,\u201d school and Division workers appropriately reacted to determine the depth of the child\u2019s depression. The facts show the child was upset, possibly distraught by her perceived treatment by S.I., and she was also troubled by her classmates\u2019 conduct, a longstanding problem the school was purportedly addressing. But the record contains no evidence that describes the child\u2019s behaviors when she was examined by the mobile crisis unit or any recommendation by those responders after speaking with the child. The record also lacks evidence demonstrating the effect of S.I.\u2019s conduct. The judge observed, mental health concerns attendant to the behavior identified by school officials are a subject left for experts to determine. At trial, no evidence was offered assessing the level of risk posed. When S.I. refused to take the child to the hospital, certainly at that time the child\u2019s safety was secured by the intervention of school and Division officials. Acting as <em>parens patriae, </em>the Division had the child examined. Therefore, even though S.I. declined to take the child to the hospital because she disagreed with the Division\u2019s assessment of the circumstances, she did not thwart efforts to obtain the desired evaluation. The Division later learned the hospital could not identify any underlying medical or mental health conditions, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>did not recommend a course of necessary treatment, or diagnose a risk requiring immediate care.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">There are additional undisputed facts not addressed in the judge\u2019s opinion, which support S.I.\u2019s belief the child\u2019s comments did not manifest urgent attention. S.I.\u2019s decision was informed by her parental experience, from which she concluded the child was exhibiting teenage rebellion after being disciplined for poor school performance. These include: S.I. had raised the child for most of her life, without incident or intervention from the Division; S.I.\u2019s recent unemployment caused her to more closely scrutinize the child\u2019s behaviors, which she identified as more disrespectful as she entered her teens; and S.I. related the child\u2019s previous attempts at manipulation, when disciplined or denied what she wanted.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">S.I. also had demonstrated her care for the child\u2019s well-being. She detailed proactive efforts undertaken to curtail peer bullying and implement protocols with teachers to aid the child in the event of future incidents. S.I. also initiated counseling for the child to assist with these concerns.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">Admittedly, when told of her granddaughter\u2019s interview comments and the feelings she expressed in the uncovered note, S.I. became upset, angered, and her statements suggest she felt rejected. We do not countenance S.I.\u2019s lack of cooperation with the school or the Division. Her decision declining to immediately seek a mental health evaluation perhaps was a mistake; however, it cannot be said to rise to the level of gross or wanton negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">We also cannot ignore S.I.\u2019s view of her granddaughter\u2019s behavior in part was justified by the Division\u2019s investigation, which concluded the child\u2019s claims of physical abuse at the hands of S.I. were unfounded, not merely unsubstantiated. The child\u2019s claim of estrangement from her parents also was not supported by the parents\u2019 statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-9\">The trial judge did not reject S.I.\u2019s testimony as not credible. Rather, she rejected S.I.\u2019s view on the need for the child\u2019s mental status examination based on a general concern for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>teenage suicide and the emotional effects of bullying. There is no evidential support for the judge\u2019s finding that this child \u201cwas in probable danger of having some kind of mental episode.\u201d The record contains no expert evidence or even admissible documentary evidence supporting this assertion. Indeed, the record reflects only the judge\u2019s opinion, which cannot be used to substantiate legal conclusions. \u201cJudges at the trial and appellate level cannot fill in missing information on their own or take judicial notice of harm. Instead, the fact-sensitive nature of abuse and neglect cases, turns on particularized evidence.\u201d <em>A.L., supra, </em>213 <em>N.J. </em>at 28, 59 A.3d 576 (internal citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">Examining the totality of the facts and circumstances facing this family, we cannot conclude S.I.\u2019s emotional and angry response to her granddaughter\u2019s comments was grossly or wantonly negligent, made knowing that injury was likely or made with reckless disregard that substantial likelihood of harm would befall the child. No evidence was presented to demonstrate the child\u2019s physical, mental, or emotional condition was impaired or that she was in imminent danger of harming herself as a result of S.I.\u2019s decision to decline the recommendation for an immediate evaluation. Accordingly, the judge\u2019s conclusion to the contrary cannot withstand scrutiny and the underlying evidence is insufficient to show abuse or neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">Our comments must not be misunderstood as questioning the Division\u2019s precautionary response to assure the child received a mental health evaluation. When the SPRU worker was confronted with the child\u2019s comments during her interview and her feelings expressed in the uncovered note, along with S.I.\u2019s refusal to take the child straight to the hospital, the need to act was manifest. In fact, S.I.\u2019s extreme emotional response prevented her from offering a reasoned alternative course, leaving removal as the only available option. However, rather than resorting to Title 9, the Division has extensive authority to assure children are protected under the State\u2019s child welfare laws pursuant to <em>N.J.S.A. </em>30:4C-11 and -12. As detailed by Chief Justice Rabner\u2019s opinion in AL., <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>these statutory provisions authorize not only services, but as necessary, care and custody. <em>A.L., supra, </em>213 <em>N.J. </em>at 30-34, 59 A.3d 576. Every event requiring the Division\u2019s intervention does not result from abuse or neglect.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">Moreover, our holding intends to underscore the need for evidence to support a claim of abuse or neglect, as interpreted by the Court in AL. This includes proof of actual harm or, in the absence of actual harm, \u201cthe Division was obligated to present competent evidence adequate to establish [the child was] presently in imminent danger of being impaired physically, mentally or emotionally.\u201d <em>N.J. Div. of Child Prot. &amp; Permanency v. M.C., </em>435 <em>N.J.Super. </em>405, 409, 89 A.3d 225 (App.Div.2014) (citations omitted). These essential proofs cannot merely be based on the Division\u2019s view that the parent or guardian\u2019s decision on behalf of a child was ill-advised. Rather, the Division must demonstrate harm or show the likelihood of an imminent substantial risk of harm rising above mere negligence. AL., <em>supra, </em>213 <em>N.J. </em>at 28, 59 A.3d 576; <em>S.S., supra, </em>372 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 24, 855 A.2d 8. Such evidence is absent here. Accordingly, S.I.\u2019s demonstrated failure to comply with the recommended psychiatric evaluation was not proven to be medical neglect under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>9:6-8.21(c)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-6\">Reversed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b174-11\"> It is not clear how long the child was in S.I.\u2019s care and custody.
