Defendant was sentenced to commitment in a mental health facility for a term not to exceed eighteen months.</p>\n<p id=\"b369-13\">After defendant\u2019s trial, but prior to our decision on her appeal, we decided <em>State v. Handy, </em>421 <em>N.J.Super. </em>559, 25 A.3d 1140 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>(App.Div.2011). In <em>Handy, </em>we concluded that a defendant found competent to stand trial, but not able to knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waive the insanity defense to a crime, should not be compelled to accept an acquittal by reason of insanity unless his or her substantive defenses are addressed fust. <em>See id. </em>at 565, 25 A.3d 1140. Only if the jury rejected a defendant\u2019s substantive defenses would defendant then present the insanity defense. <em>Handy, supra, </em>421 <em>N.J.Super. </em>at 612-13, 25 A.3d 1140. Consistent with our decision in <em>Handy, </em>we remanded to the trial court, to afford defendant the opportunity for a new trial on the stalking charge \u2014 if she were again found competent to stand trial and if she opted to waive double jeopardy. That new trial would follow the bifurcated order described in our decision in <em>Handy </em>\u2014 an initial trial at which defendant would present substantive defense theories, and if convicted, a second trial at which she would present only the insanity defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-5\">When the State\u2019s appeal of our decision reached the Supreme Court, <em>Handy </em>and its predecessor, <em>State v. Khan, </em>175 <em>N.J.Super. </em>72, 417 A.2d 585 (App.Div.1980), were overruled in part, and the bifurcated procedure was disapproved. <em>State v. Handy, </em>215 <em>N.J. </em>334, 73 A.3d 421 (2013). Henceforth, \u201ctrials involving a substantive defense and the insanity defense [would] be tried in a unitary proceeding.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 364, 73 A.3d 421.</p>\n<p id=\"b370-6\">The Court also supplied the analytical solution to the quandary posed by a defendant found competent to stand trial, who wishes to waive the insanity defense altogether when that option appears unwise. As the Court said,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-7\">part of the legacy of the <em>Khan </em>decision has been confusion about whether one can be competent to stand trial but incompetent to waive the insanity defense____Part of the confusion arises from the assumption that the question involves not so much the defendant\u2019s competence to waive the insanity defense but the wisdom of making that choice.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b370-10\"><em>lid. </em>at 361, 73 A.3d 421]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b370-11\">The Court went on to observe the decision can be made by applying:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>a procedure akin to that which we utilize in evaluating a competent defendant\u2019s effort to waive other significant rights. That is, a thorough and searching inquiry of an otherwise competent defendant concerning his or her understanding of the nature of the right being waived and the implications that flow from that choice ... the trial court [must] determine whether the decision to waive the insanity defense, particularly in the context of a unified trial proceeding, is indeed knowing, voluntary and intelligent.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b371-5\"><em>[Id. </em>at 362, 73 A.3d 421 (citation omitted).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b371-6\">After certification was granted on defendant\u2019s appeal, the matter was summarily remanded for reconsideration in light of the <em>Handy </em>decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-7\">Given the Court\u2019s instruction that the waiver of an insanity defense by a competent defendant was to be scrutinized on appellate review as would be any other waiver made by a competent defendant, we now affirm. The Law Division judge\u2019s decision that defendant lacked the capacity to make a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver was adequately supported by the record and thus warrants affirmance.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-8\">The stalking charge was the culmination of defendant\u2019s relocation to New Jersey in 2002 from her home in Colorado, during which she moved her personal belongings, including a number of weapons, in a truck and horse trailer. Defendant came to New Jersey with the hope of encountering a seminar presenter, the victim of the stalking, whom she had met several years earlier. Defendant was eventually charged with the offenses at issue when she left a voicemail on the victim\u2019s phone despite a no-contact order.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-9\">Defendant\u2019s pretrial competency hearings extended over approximately a year. Multiple psychiatric and psychological evaluations were completed, as well as a fitness to proceed assessment under <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:4-5 by the Department of Human Services. On April 25, 2008, the trial judge determined that defendant met the statutory test pursuant to N.J.S.A. 2C:4-4 and <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:4-6 for competence to stand trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>On September 18, 2008, a final hearing was conducted after counsel provided the court with an evaluation by defendant\u2019s expert, Dr. Kenneth J. Weiss. It was on that date that the judge determined that, while defendant was competent to stand trial, she could not waive the insanity defense. The determination relied heavily on Weiss\u2019s report.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">On remand, defendant again contends that the trial judge \u201cshould have accepted [defendant\u2019s] waiver of the insanity defense and proceeded solely on the substantive defenses.\u201d The argument is premised on the court\u2019s earlier finding that she was competent to stand trial. Defendant argues from that finding that she should therefore \u201calso have been competent to waive the insanity defense.\u201d But, a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver requires more than competence as defined by statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">In the competency hearing, the trial judge heard testimony and reviewed reports regarding defendant\u2019s extensive mental health history and diagnoses. It became clear that defendant, despite medication and treatment efforts, persisted in her delusion that the victim wanted to continue a relationship with her. In fact, when the judge addressed defendant directly, she complained to the judge that her attorney was not representing her in the fashion that she wished because counsel would not present the defense that the victim had solicited contact. Defendant also insisted that she and the victim had enjoyed a relationship for years, the victim had asked her to relocate, and that after she did so, on multiple occasions, the victim would attempt to see her in public, \u201cat the post office, at the store,\u201d and would <em>jog </em>and ride her bicycle past defendant\u2019s house.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">Along those lines, Weiss\u2019s report quoted defendant denying that her relationship with the victim was a delusion, stating that she was not actually insane during the times that she contacted the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>victim and that \u201cshe did not want to raise issues of her mental state at trial because the prosecutor is anti-mental illness.\u201d Defendant, who was initially in the Pretrial Intervention Program (PTI),<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> said to Weiss that the PTI probation officer had told her that the only way she would be granted the opportunity to explain her relationship with the victim to a judge would be to violate PTI, which she did, resulting in the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">Defendant also believed that, unless the victim stopped lying about her, she had to have a trial, as the victim was \u201c \u2018trying to save herself.\u2019 \u201d Defendant agreed with Weiss that \u201cshe was mentally disturbed during the time in question[] but rather than making that an issue at trial, she want[ed] \u2018the truth\u2019 to come out.\u201d Defendant perceived the State to be overreacting to the situation and believed the prosecutor wanted \u201cto do a great deal of harm to her.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">In Weiss\u2019s opinion, defendant, despite being a person of above-average intelligence, was completely unable to realistically assess her situation vis-\u00e1-vis the victim. She repeated to Weiss the statement that she had made to others \u2014 that the victim loved her. That, Weiss said, was \u201cmost clearly against all evidence and would have to be considered delusional. Because of this, [defendant] does not see that what she did was wrong.... [S]he would not have a rational understanding of the basis for the charges.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">Weiss opined that, on the stalking charge, defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-9\">was psychotic and delusional during the dates in question, to the point that she was unable to observe the nature and quality of her conduct____[Sjhe did not have the residual ability to know that she would be placing the victim in fear of bodily injury or to know that she was doing wrong.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-12\">As a result of mental disease, she had a \u201cdefect of reason such that she did not know what she was doing was wrong[ ] ... consistent with the requirements of <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:4-1.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-13\">Weiss further opined that, even if defendant was found to be competent to stand trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>she would be making the choice to forego an insanity defense <em>knowingly, </em>but neither <em>intelligently </em>nor <em>voluntarily. </em>She is aware of her rights and alternatives, but fails to comprehend the consequences of failing to assert the defense, which bears on the question of an <em>intelligent </em>refusal. Her delusional condition has narrowed her ability to form judgments about her case, and in that sense she is not acting of her own free will, which bears on the question of a <em>voluntary </em>refusal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">Ultimately, he concluded that defendant met \u201cthe test for \u2018insanity\u2019 with respect to the stalking charge\u201d and \u201cf[ell] short of the requirements in <em>Khan</em><footnotemark><em>[4]</em></footnotemark><em> </em>for a refusal to utilize the available insanity defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">Substantially relying on Weiss\u2019s report, along with all the other evidence, the judge found that, despite defendant\u2019s superficially rational expressed rejection of the insanity defense because of the potential for \u201chospital time\u201d that she considered the equivalent of incarceration, the real impetus behind her waiver was her imagined relationship with the victim. The judge was convinced by the State\u2019s proofs that no relationship had ever existed with the victim. He therefore decided, pursuant to <em>Khan, to </em>\u201cassert the insanity defense\u201d on defendant\u2019s behalf as to the stalking charge because she could not \u201cvoluntarily, intelligently and knowingly waive that defense.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">The Court in <em>Handy </em>reaffirmed the notion that a trial judge could find a defendant competent to stand trial, while simultaneously finding he or she cannot voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently waive the insanity defense. <em>Handy, supra, </em>215 <em>N.J. </em>at 361-62, 73 A.3d 421. In that scenario, the trial judge must, after a \u201csearching inquiry,\u201d determine whether a defendant truly understands that which he or she is waiving and the potential consequences of the choice. <em>Handy, supra, </em>215 <em>N.J. </em>at 362, 73 A.3d 421. In other words, whether the waiver is indeed knowing, voluntary, and intelligent. <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">When considering whether a criminal defendant\u2019s waiver is sustainable, trial courts must \u201capply a procedure akin to that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>which we utilize in evaluating a competent defendant\u2019s effort to waive other significant rights.\u201d <em>See Handy, supra, </em>215 <em>N.J. </em>at 362, 73 A.3d 421.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">For instance, in <em>State v. DuBois, </em>189 <em>N.J. </em>454, 464-66, 916 A.2d 450 (2007), the Court entrusted the issue of a defendant\u2019s waiver of the right to counsel to the \u201csound discretion\u201d of our trial judges, explaining that they are \u201cin the best position to evaluate [a] defendant\u2019s understanding of what it mean[s] to [self-]represent [ ] and whether [a] defendant\u2019s decision to proceed pro se [i]s knowing and intelligent.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 475, 916 A.2d 450.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">Examining the record, as mandated by <em>Handy, </em>created by the judge\u2019s \u201cthorough and searching inquiry,\u201d it is clear that the trial judge, over the multiple days of pretrial testimony regarding defendant\u2019s competence to stand trial, delved thoroughly into defendant\u2019s psychiatric history, diagnosis, and treatment. When addressing her attempted waiver of the insanity defense, he engaged in a colloquy with her about her reasons. Defendant\u2019s responses were not related to any legal issue or consequence. The responses related on the whole to her false beliefs about the victim and her desire to affirm her imagined relationship in court. She also claimed that she could not raise the insanity defense because the prosecutor was \u201canti-mental illness,\u201d a statement irrelevant to the question posed.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">Clearly, defendant lacked the ability to make a rational choice on the question of defenses to the stalking count. She wanted validation of the \u201ctruth\u201d of her imagined relationship with the victim, a motive irrelevant to the legal decision of waiver, unrelated to trial strategy, or even to any legal question. On the subject of the stalking charge, defendant\u2019s reasons for waiving the insanity defense were neither intelligent, nor voluntary, arising as they did from a compulsion.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">Accordingly, we find that the trial judge did not err. His conclusion was, indeed, based on \u201csufficient supporting evidence.\u201d <em>See State v. Purnell, </em>394 <em>N.J.Super. </em>28, 50, 925 A.2d 71 (App.Div. 2007). Defendant\u2019s decision to waive the insanity defense was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>knowing, voluntary, and intelligent. <em>See Handy, supra, </em>215 <em>N.J. </em>at 362, 73 A.3d 421. The judge\u2019s decision to interpose the defense over defendant\u2019s objection was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b369-14\"> The jury convicted defendant of fourth-degree possession of prohibited weapons or devices, hollow-point bullets, <em>NJ.S.A. </em>2C:39-3(1)(1), and third-degree unlawful possession of a handgun, a .22 Ruger, <em>NJ.S.A. </em>2C:39-5(b). The insanity defense was not raised as to those crimes. Defendant was sentenced to concurrent five years of probation on those offenses. Because of several relaled arrests, incarceration pending evaluations, and the trial itself, defendant accumulated 1215 days of jail credit by September 30, 2009, the sentence date.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b371-10\"> The trial judge summarized his conclusions thus: \"[Defendant] comprehends that she is in a court of justice charged with a criminal offense, that there is a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>judge on the bench, that there is a prosecutor present who will try to convict her .... that she has a lawyer .... and [] she understands her right not to testify.\u201d Defendant does not appeal from the finding of competence to stand trial.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b373-14\"> <em>N.J.S.A. </em>2C:43-12 to-22.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"[4]\">\n<p id=\"b374-9\">4 Weiss\u2019 report predated the decision in <em>Handy.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
