G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 152. The Superior Court entered a .decree in accordance with the conclusions of the Industrial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"461\">*461</page-number>Accident Board, that the employee as a result of an injury received on December 15, 1931, had been totally incapacitated for work since December 9, 1932, when compensation was discontinued by the board, and was entitled to compensation for total incapacity from December 9, 1932, to be continued subject to the provisions of the act. The insurer appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\">It was agreed that the employee received an injury on December 15, 1931, but the insurer contends that the evidence did not warrant a finding that his condition at the time of the hearing by the board member resulted from that injury or that he then was totally incapacitated. We cannot say that the findings were not warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">The employee\u2019s injury was a fracture of the first metatarsal of his left foot, caused by a steel beam falling on top of the foot. At the hearing before the single member on May 10, 1933, the employee testified that at the time of the injury \u201che was a blacksmith on auto work, the heaviest kind of work,\u201d that he worked two days in June, 1932, but \u201chas not done any work since. . . . the foot is so stiff that he can scarcely walk. ... He cannot step forward on the injured foot at all. . . . His foot is no better than it was some months ago,\u201d and that he cannot do heavy work. The impartial physician, who examined the employee on December 1, 1932, in his report stated that there was \u201can increase in the size of the first metatarso-phalangeal joint\u201d of the injured foot, and that the \u201cfracture has long since healed but there still remains a tenderness over this metatarsal below the fracture. ... It probably represents a nerve ending that was caught in the callous from adhesions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">There was testimony from three orthopedic surgeons, in some detail, as to the condition of the employee\u2019s foot, and the treatment which had been given and ought to be given. All testified to some restriction of motion in the great toe joint of the left foot. One of them, called by the insurer, testified that he examined the employee on July 26, 1932, that the employee \u201ccomplained of sensitiveness to palpation over and under the first metatarsal throughout its <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"462\">*462</page-number>entire length,\u201d that \u201cThis man experienced principally a traumatic injury and fracture of the first metatarsal of the left foot, with ensuing disability to date,\u201d and that the witness saw the employee again on October 13, 1932, and \u201cat that time the examination differed slightly from July 26 in that there was little or no sensitiveness under the first metatarsal and no complaints when rising on the ball of the foot or rolling to the outer border,\u201d but that if the employee said that then he could not \u201cstand on his feet all day long doing heavy work such as blacksmith and iron work,\u201d the witness \u201cwould not say that he is wrong.\u201d The employee \u201cstill complained of symptoms which the . . . [witness] could not explain from an orthopedic standpoint,\u201d but the witness \u201ccould not rule out possible neurological background, although he saw nothing to indicate injury to any one particular nerve.\u201d This witness had no basis for any opinion of the employee\u2019s condition at the time of the hearing. Another of these surgeons, called by the insurer, who last saw the employee in October, 1932, testified that he did not think the employee\u2019s then condition was a \u201cproximate result of the broken bone above the toe. There is a possibility because of the fracture that the nerves coming along the metatarsal bone would become adhered to the joint that would cause trouble, but not a probability.\u201d The witness believed the restriction of motion \u201cwas due to some infection,\u201d that it \u201cis probably due to constant slight traumas so that the joint becomes irritated, or infections in the joint which afterward irritate it.\u201d The third surgeon, called by the employee, had seen him six times, first on February 3, 1933, and last on May 1, 1933. He testified that the employee\u2019s great toe joint on the left foot was enlarged, that there was \u201ca good deal of local tenderness-throughout the joint,\u201d and that he did not think that the employee \u201ccan do hard work at the present time,\u201d though \u201che might be able to do some light work: he does not think he is totally disabled.\u201d This witness testified also to some enlargement of the joint of the right foot, which he attributed to arthritis or \u201cflat feet,\u201d but that the \u201cleft foot is a little larger at the joint compared with the right, perhaps <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>one fourth inch larger, which is quite a little difference in a great toe joint.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">Some of the evidence above summarized, and other evidence not here summarized, tended to show that the condition of the employee\u2019s foot in December, 1932, and thereafter, was not caused by the injury, but the evidence must be considered in its aspect most favorable to the employee. And the evidence so considered warranted a finding that there was a causal relation between the injury and the employee\u2019s condition. The evidence of the impartial physician tended to show that the injury was the reasonably probable cause of the condition of the employee\u2019s left foot at the time he examined him. <em>Marlow </em>v. <em>Dike, </em>269 Mass. 38, 40. <em>Rash </em>v. <em>Albert, </em>271 Mass. 247, 252. <em>Blanchard\u2019s Case, </em>277 Mass. 413, and cases cited. See <em>DeFilippo\u2019s ' Case, </em>284 Mass. 531, 534-535. And other evidence tended to show that the condition of the employee\u2019s left foot at the time of the hearing was a continuance of the previous condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">The surgeon who last examined the employee before the hearing testified that he \u201cfelt\u201d that the employee \u201cshould be operated on for permanent relief,\u201d but that \u201cHe will be disabled between two and three months at least from doing hard work after that operation.\u201d Another surgeon testified that he \u201cdid not believe that there was any operation indicated in October, 1932.\u201d The board was not required as matter of law on this testimony and related evidence to find that \u201cit fairly appears that the result of such operation will be a substantial physical gain,\u201d or that the employee, after reasonable opportunity therefor, had unreasonably refused to submit to an operation. <em>Snooks\u2019s Case, </em>264 Mass. 92, 93-94. See also <em>Floccher\u2019s Case, </em>221 Mass. 54, 55. The board, therefore, was not precluded by testimony in regard to an operation from finding partial or total incapacity during the period in question. Whether failure to submit to such an operation will be a ground for discontinuance of compensation, wholly or in part, is not before us on this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-7\">There was evidence that the employee was incapacitated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>for work to a considerable extent and, particularly, that he was incapacitated for the kind of work in which he was engaged before his injury. There was also evidence from which it could be found that he made reasonable efforts to obtain work of a kind which he could perform. He testified to specific attempts which were unsuccessful and stated that he \u201cwas looking for anything at all in light work\u201d and \u201cwould have taken a light job, but if it was heavy work he could not have done it.\u201d There was no evidence of business conditions during the period in question and in the absence of such evidence \u201cthe single member and the board were entitled 'to use their own judgment and knowledge in determining that question.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hurwitz\u2019s Case, </em>280 Mass. 477, 482. In view of the evidence of the employee\u2019s physical condition, the board was not precluded from attributing his inability to secure work to the injury rather than to business conditions. See <em>Manley\u2019s Case, </em>282 Mass. 38. The finding, therefore, of total incapacity cannot be pronounced unwarranted. <em>Sullivan\u2019s Case, </em>218 Mass. 141. <em>Duprey\u2019s Case, </em>219 Mass. 189, 193. <em>Rezendes </em>v. <em>Prudential Ins. Co. of America, 285 </em>Mass. 505, 512.</p>\n<p id=\"b494-3\">\n<em>Decree affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
