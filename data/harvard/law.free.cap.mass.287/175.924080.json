The first count alleges that in treating the plaintiff\u2019s testatrix before, during and after childbirth he was guilty of \u201cwanton and reckless acts\u201d as well as \u201cnegligence,\u201d which caused her death. The second count is for conscious suffering from the same wrong. No question of pleading is raised. There was not the slightest evidence of any \u201cwanton and reckless acts,\u201d and the only question argued relates to the negligence alleged.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-9\">There was evidence tending to show negligence in failing to discover that the plaintiff\u2019s testatrix had scarlet fever until the disease was advanced beyond the point at which antitoxin might have been of service. There was evidence tending to show negligence in removing her from the maternity ward of a hospital to her mother\u2019s tenement, where facilities for treatment and care were limited, rather than to a hospital for contagious diseases. She died from septicemia, the result of scarlet fever. The difficulty with the plaintiff\u2019s case is that there is nothing to show any probability that she would have recovered or lived longer or suffered less, if due care had been used. <em>Semerjian </em>v. <em>Stetson, </em>284 Mass. 510. <em>De Filippo\u2019s Case, </em>284 Mass. 531. Compare <em>Bennett </em>v. <em>Fitzgerald, </em>284 Mass. 535, and <em>Marangian </em>v. <em>Apelian, </em>286 Mass. 429. The direction of a verdict in favor of the defendant was right.</p>\n<p id=\"b206-10\">\n<em>Judgment for the defendant.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
