The balance, if any, after the payments for the aforesaid purposes may, during the period aforesaid, be appropriated for such other municipal purposes as the city council may from time to time determine, subject to the provisions of general law so far as applicable.\u201d Section 3 of the act further provided that during the period of the existence of the Fall River board of finance, the operation of the provisions of any law inconsistent therewith should be suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">St. 1908, c. 320, \u00a7 1, provides that the water department of the city shall continue to be in charge of the Watuppa water board. Section 2 of the act recites that \u201cSaid water board may set aside and use so much of the surplus from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>the receipts of the water department as the board may deem proper, for the construction and maintenance of a water reservoir on the western shore of the North Watuppa pond, or of tanks in the city, to supply the city with water, in addition to the maintenance and extension of its water works plant and pumping station, and also for an emergency fund of not less than thirty thousand dollars, to be used in case of emergency, to renew or replace any part of the plant necessary to supply water for domestic or manufacturing purposes, or for the extinguishment of fires in the said city.\u201d Section 3 recites that \u201cThe city council of the city shall not pass any ordinance which would prevent or impair the exercise of the powers herein granted. And the provisions of this act shall have full force and effect, any ordinance to the contrary notwithstanding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b308-3\">St. 1871, c. 133, \u00a7 17, provides that \u201cThe city council shall from time to time regulate the price or rent for the use of the water, with a view to the payment from the net income and receipts, not only the interest, but ultimately the principal of said debt so contracted, so far as the same may be practicable and reasonable . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b308-4\">In 1874 an ordinance was adopted by the city in pursuance of the provisions of St. 1871, c. 133. By the ordinances of the city in force up to November, 1907, it was provided that all receipts from water rates should be paid to the city treasurer and placed by him to the credit of the waterworks, and should be appropriated, first to the payment of the expenses of the management and repairs of the works; and then, in the order mentioned, to the payment of interest on the water loan, to pay for extensions within certain limits, for expenses to be incurred for the better protection and preservation of the water supply under St. 1891, c. 114, and under acts in amendment thereof, and finally to principal of the water loan. The history of the legislation relative to the water loan of the city was reviewed at length by this court in <em>Sinclair </em>v. <em>Mayor of Fall River, </em>198 Mass. 248. In that case it was said at page 255 by Sheldon, J., speaking for the court: \u201cThe ordinance does not create any disproportionate burden of taxation. Those who take water from the city\u2019s works do so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>voluntarily, and agree thereby to pay the rates as fixed from time to time by the city council. It is not necessarily to be regretted if the net income from the water rates shall be found temporarily to yield some profit over the expenses of maintaining them and providing for the cost of their construction. The provision in St. 1902, c. 393, \u00a7 23, cl. 15, that the water department of the city shall be under the charge of the Watuppa water board, does not of course take away the power of the city council to make appropriations for the expenses and dispose of the net income from the waterworks.\u201d St. 1931, c. 403, \u00a7 1, hereinbefore referred to, expressly provided that the balance if any of the water receipts might be appropriated \u201cfor such other municipal purposes as the city council may from time to time determine . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b309-3\">There is no allegation in the bill of fraud or collusion on the part of the defendants; or that any change in the existing water rates is contemplated. There is nothing to show that the defendants are not acting in accordance with the authority conferred upon them by statute. The bill does not allege that the existing water rates are to be increased. The principal complaint of the plaintiffs as shown by paragraph 9 of the bill is that the charges for water are \u201cdisproportionate and unreasonable\u201d and \u201ccontrary to the constitutional requirement that there shall be levied \u2018proportional and reasonable assessments, rates and taxes upon all the inhabitants\u2019 thereof.\u201d There is no merit in any of these allegations. The question whether the charges for water are reasonable or otherwise cannot be considered or determined by a petition brought under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 40, \u00a7 53. If the plaintiffs desire to contest the reasonableness of the charges they are required to do so by proper proceedings brought for that purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-4\">It follows that the demurrer was properly sustained. The final decree dismissing the bill is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-5\">\n<em>Ordered accordingly.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
