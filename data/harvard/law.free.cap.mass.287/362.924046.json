The plaintiffs brought two actions for the death, under G. L. (Ter. Ed.) c. 229, \u00a7 5, one against Nelson and the other against the defendant. At the trial of those actions together, the defendant moved at the close of the evidence that the plaintiffs be required to elect between the actions. To the denial of this motion the defendant excepted. The defendant then moved for a directed verdict in its favor, \u25a0 evidently on the ground that the actions could not be prosecuted together, and excepted to the denial of this motion also. The jury awarded the plaintiffs $500 damages for death in each action, and the defendant excepted \u201cto the jury\u2019s verdict against it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">There was no joint tort, but the actual fault was that of the servant alone. For that reason, if no other existed, a single action against master and servant would not lie. <em>Popkin </em>v. <em>Goldman, </em>266 Mass. 531, 536. See also <em>Hewett </em>v. <em>Swift, </em>3 Allen, 420, 424, 425; <em>Gavin </em>v. <em>Kluge, </em>275 Mass. 372, 379. Besides, in death cases no single action against joint wrongdoers can be maintained. <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Thayer, </em>212 Mass. 392, 399, 400. Since there was but one wrong, there is force in the argument that only one penalty should be collected, and that ultimately the burden should fall upon the servant. See <em>White </em>v. <em>Phillipston, </em>10 Met. 108, 111, explained in <em>Moynihan </em>v. <em>Todd, </em>188 Mass. 301, 303; <em>Porter </em>v. <em>Sorell, </em>280 Mass. 457. That need not be decided now. Both master and servant, however, were liable to the plaintiffs in separate actions. The judge was not bound to compel the plaintiffs to elect at the trial (see <em>Bruce </em>v. <em>Johnson, </em>277 Mass. 273, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>275), but might permit them to pursue both master and servant until satisfaction was obtained. See <em>Pion </em>v. <em>Caron, </em>237 Mass. 107, 111, 112.</p>\n<p id=\"b394-4\">\n<em>Exceptions overruled.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
