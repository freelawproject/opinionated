The court below, after considering the petition, answer and depositions, found that a bid of $4,700 was accepted from the appellant defendant, although the petitioner defendant was prepared to give $7,000, if the attention of its representative had not been \u201ctemporarily distracted by other business,\u201d at the moment when the property was put up; that his attention was not pointedly called to the fact that it was being cried for sale because no description thereof was read, although it was customary to read such descriptions when properties were reached on the list at sheriff\u2019s sales in that county. The court further found that the petitioner\u2019s representative immediately notified the person to whom the property had been sold that he was prepared to offer $7,000, and asked either that the sale be set aside or his bid substituted in place of the one accepted; that petitioner was \u201clulled to sleep\u201d by certain assurances of the purchaser, so that nothing more was done at the moment; but that petitioner moved promptly to bring the matter to the attention of the court below, before the time for confirmation of the sale. In view of these circumstances, and the fact, as found, that $4,700 was an inadequate price, the court, in the exercise of its discretion, directed the sale set aside. It appears that, before this was done, the petitioner deposited $700, or 10% of its proposed bid, and tendered \u201cany additional security the court [might] desire\u201d to guarantee the balance of its bid.</p>\n<p id=\"b48-4\">It is well established law that the setting aside or refusal to set aside a sheriff\u2019s sale is a matter within the sound discretion of the local court, and that the decree of such tribunal will not be reversed unless \u201cgross and manifest abuse of discretion\u201d appears: Stroup v. Raymond, 183 Pa. 279, 281; Haspel v. Lyons, 41 Pa. Superior Ct. 285, 286; see also Germer v. Ensign, 155 Pa. 464, 466; Snyder v. Snyder, 244 Pa. 331, 335; Somerville v. Hill, 260 Pa. 477, 481. In Light v. Zeller, 195 Pa. 315, 316, we said: \u201cWhile inadequacy of price is not, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"25\">*25</page-number>itself [enough] to justify the court in setting aside a sheriff\u2019s sale, yet where there is great inadequacy the court may seize upon other circumstances in order to give relief.\u201d There is sufficient inadequacy of price here, with the other facts stated in the opinion of the court below, to sustain the order assigned as error.</p>\n<p id=\"b49-4\">The appeal is dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
