J.</author>\n<p id=\"AYl\">This is an action for partial refund of personal property taxes on certain aircraft (hereinafter certificated aircraft). The plaintiffs and appellants who are seeking refunds are several airlines (hereinafter the airlines).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The defendants and respondents are various counties <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>which have collected tax on the aircraft (hereinafter the counties).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Fifty-six related actions throughout the state were coordinated in Los Angeles Superior Court pursuant to Code of Civil Procedure section 404 et seq. and California Rules of Court, rule 1501 et seq., under the special title Aircraft Taxation Cases (Judicial Council Coordination Proceeding No. 2070). The airlines appeal from a summary judgment entered in favor of the counties.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">The theory of the airlines\u2019 action for refund of personal property taxes is that the airlines do not own the certificated aircraft, but lease them from banks and financial corporations. According to this theory, the certificated aircraft are exempt from personal property tax because qualified banks and financial corporations pay a franchise tax which is in lieu of most other taxes, including personal property tax. (Cal. Const., art. XIII, \u00a7 27; Rev. &amp; Tax. Code, \u00a7 23182; 61 Ops.Cal.Atty.Gen. 472 (1978).) Furthermore, the airlines contend that during the 1981 to 1986 tax years involved in this case, no statute imposed a property tax on leasehold possessory interests in tax-exempt personal property. <em>(General Dynamics Corp. </em>v. <em>County of L.A. </em>(1958) 51 Cal.2d 59, 66-67.)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">The underlying validity of this theory and several pertinent sub-issues were not determined by the trial court and we express no opinion thereon. The only issue on this appeal is the one on which summary judgment was granted. The counties contend, and the trial court agreed, that it makes no difference whether the certificated aircraft are owned by tax-exempt banks and financial corporations. The counties contend that Revenue and Taxation Code sections 1150 to 1156<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> impose property tax on the value of the aircraft \u201coperated\u201d by the airlines.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">We reverse. Sections 1150 to 1156 do not impose a new tax or limit an existing exemption. These sections merely provide an allocation formula to determine the proportionate extent to which certificated aircraft are situated, for taxing purposes, in different taxing jurisdictions. Sections 1150 to 1156 do not address the underlying question raised by the airlines, whether these aircraft are exempt from personal property taxation in the first place by virtue of their alleged ownership by banks and financial corporations.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">We remand the matter so that the genuine remaining issues may be determined. We express no opinion on the other merits of the airlines\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>theory for refunds. We merely hold that sections 1150 to 1156 are not relevant to the tax exemption asserted by the airlines.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b171-6\">Both the language and the legislative history of sections 1150 to 1156 show these sections deal only with the special problem of determining the tax \u201csitus\u201d of the aircraft operated by air carriers engaged in air transportation.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-7\">\n<em>Statutory Language</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b171-8\">Taxable property is normally assessed \u201cwhere the property is situated.\u201d (\u00a7 404.) Aircraft involve special considerations because they are movable. General aircraft (which expressly excludes the certificated aircraft involved in this case (\u00a7\u00a7 1150, 5303)) are assessed by the county in which they are \u201chabitually situated.\u201d (\u00a7\u00a7 5362, 5366.)</p>\n<p id=\"b171-9\">\u201cCertificated aircraft,\u201d however, are considered in sections 1150 to 1156 <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> This statutory scheme provides a diiferent method <em>for determining the tax situs </em>of certificated aircraft. Section 1151 provides, \u201cCertificated aircraft <em>shall be deemed to be situated in this state only to the extent </em>that such aircraft are normally physically present within the state, whether in flight or on the ground. <em>To determine such extent </em>for purposes of property taxation, the allocation formula specified by Section 1152 shall be applied.\u201d (Italics added.) Section 1155 provides in pertinent part that, <em>\u201cFor purposes of Section 404, certificated aircraft shall be deemed to be situated </em>only in those taxing agencies in which the aircraft normally make physical contact with sufficient regularity to entitle such agencies to tax the aircraft under the laws and Constitution of the United States.\u201d (Italics added.) Section 1156 provides, \u201cNothing in this article shall be construed to enlarge the right of any taxing agency to tax certificated aircraft in a manner not permitted by the laws or Constitution of the United States.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b171-10\">The reason for these special rules for certificated aircraft is clear. Because they are operated by air carriers engaged in air transportation, certificated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>aircraft regularly fly in and out of California and the various California counties having major airports. Under federal due process and commerce clause considerations, personal property taxes on such aircraft must be fairly apportioned. <em>(Braniff Airways </em>v. <em>Nebraska Board </em>(1954) 347 U.S. 590, 597-602 [98 L.Ed. 967, 975-978, 74 S.Ct. 757]; <em>Slick Airways </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles </em>(1956) 140 Cal.App.2d 311, 313-315 [295 P.2d 46].) Sections 1150 to 1156 are designed to provide a uniform formula for apportioning such taxation among different taxing jurisdictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-5\">There is nothing in the language of sections 1150 to 1156 which imposes a tax on the \u201coperation\u201d of certificated aircraft.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The counties rely on the language that certificated aircraft are defined in section 1150 as \u201caircraft <em>operated by </em>an air carrier or foreign air carrier engaged in air transportation . . . .\u201d (Italics added.) This reliance is misplaced because section 1150 is merely definitional. It does not by its terms impose a tax; it defines the aircraft to which sections 1151 to 1156 apply. The latter sections do not by their language impose a tax, they provide a formula to determine, for purposes of property taxation, the extent to which certificated aircraft are situated in different taxing agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-6\">Property is subject to taxation unless it is exempt. (\u00a7 201.) The central premise of the airlines in this litigation is that personal property owned by qualified banks and financial institutions is exempt from personal property taxation. (\u00a7 23182.) The counties fail to show what language in sections 1150 to 1156 imposes a tax on property which is exempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b172-7\">These sections contain no reference to leases and do not impose a tax on leasehold possessory interests. When the Legislature has imposed a tax on leasehold possessory interests in exempt personal property, it has done so more directly. Thus, in 1973 the Legislature enacted section 201.5 which expressly provides in subdivision (a) that \u201c[p]ossessory interests in property acquired by or for the California Pollution Control Financing Authority . . . whether in real or personal property, shall be subject to taxation under this code.\u201d In 1986, the Legislature enacted section 235 which provides, \u201cFor the purposes of this division, the lessee of tangible personal property owned by a bank or financial corporation shall be conclusively presumed the owner of that property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">\n<em>Legislative History</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b172-9\">Although the statutory language is unambiguous, we address the counties\u2019 argument that the legislative history shows the Legislature intended to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>tax the airlines\u2019 certificated aircraft without regard to ownership. Contrary to the counties\u2019 contention, this history shows that the Legislature considered only the determination of an appropriate formula for allocation of property tax and did not at all consider the possibility that certificated aircraft could be exempt if owned by tax exempt entities.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">Sections 1150 to 1156 have a detailed legislative history because they were enacted as the result of recommendations in a legislative committee report. (A Final Rep. of the Assem. Com. on Rev. &amp; Tax., Vol. 4, No. 22, A Study of Aircraft Assessment in Cal. (Jan. 1968) (hereinafter referred to as Study), Appen. to 4 Assem. J. (1968 Reg. Sess.).)</p>\n<p id=\"b173-6\">The State Board of Equalization had requested the Legislature to determine a uniform method to apportion the value of commercial aircraft for property tax purposes. (Study, <em>supra, </em>at pp. 7-9.) The Study determined that although case law required some reasonable apportionment formula, there was discretion to choose among numerous possible formulas. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 1115.) The Study collected empirical data by surveying a variety of formulas used in other states. The Study considered the advantages and disadvantages of these alternatives and recommended a particular formula which combined the factors of time-in-state and arrivals-and-departures in order to encourage airlines to base their operations and service facilities in California. <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 16-26.)</p>\n<p id=\"b173-7\">In short, the discussion in the legislative committee report leading to enactment of sections 1150 to 1156 was directed <em>entirely </em>to selection from alternative <em>formulas </em>for <em>allocating </em>tax on property which was assumed to be taxable. The Study contained no discussion whatsoever about leasing versus ownership of certificated aircraft or the possibility that the aircraft could be owned by a tax-exempt entity. It contained no discussion of imposing a new tax on the \u201coperation\u201d of aircraft or imposing a theretofore unprecedented tax on leasehold possessory interests in tax-exempt personal property.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-8\">The counties\u2019 argument that the Study had anything to do with the tax exemption problem in this case is based on taking isolated words and phrases out of context. Although the Study mentioned various \u201cgoals,\u201d including treating air carriers equitably and uniformly, fully measuring the activity of aircraft in California, and reflecting benefits conferred by localities upon air carriers, these were discussed as goals <em>of the allocation formulas </em>being considered.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">The counties contend that such goals will be frustrated if a portion of these aircraft escape taxation because owned by exempt banks and financial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>corporations. They ask, why bother to devise an allocation formula if the property is exempt? This does not show, however, that sections 1150 to 1156 were addressed to the tax exemption issue. If the airlines have indeed discovered a tax \u201cloophole,\u201d that loophole cannot be simply wished away by misconstruing and misapplying an irrelevant statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">\n<em>Application of Formula and Administrative Interpretation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">Finally, the counties contend that the <em>manner </em>in which the formula is applied, as directed by regulations and a handbook of the State Board of Equalization interpreting section 1152, necessarily shows that ownership by a tax-exempt entity is irrelevant. There is no merit to this contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-7\">In order for this argument to be understood it is necessary to give some details as to how the formula in section 1152 is applied.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> The State Board of Equalization\u2019s directions to assessors on how to apply the formula are contained in a regulation (Cal. Code Regs., tit. 18, \u00a7 202, subds. (c)-(g)) and in Publication AH570, entitled Assessor\u2019s Handbook, Commercial Aircraft Value Allocation. These provisions are more briefly summarized by the Bolthouse declaration which was submitted in support of the counties\u2019 motion for summary judgment.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b175-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>The counties\u2019 argument has two elements: (1) in order to complete the assessors\u2019 forms the airlines are required to give the price of the aircraft if purchased or the cost to the lessor if leased, and (2) the final step in the calculation is to multiply the figure obtained from the allocation formula to the full cash value of an airline\u2019s worldwide fleet. Neither of these factors shows, however, that the Legislature intended in section 1152 to tax personal property which is exempt in the first instance.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-5\">The airlines concede that if leased property is <em>not exempt, </em>it may be assessed jointly to the lessor and the lessee. (\u00a7 405.) This does not necessarily show that the Legislature intended to separately tax a leasehold possessory interest in <em>exempt </em>property or to limit an existing exemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">Similarly, the constitutionality of the practice of multiplying the allocable percentage by the value of the entire worldwide fleet <em>(Slick Airways </em>v. <em>County of Los Angeles, supra, </em>140 Cal.App.2d at pp. 312-313), does not address whether the Legislature has chosen by statute (e.g., \u00a7 23182) to exempt the property from taxation in the first place.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-7\">One may readily agree with the counties that if the Legislature had considered or foreseen that certificated aircraft might escape personal property taxation if owned by banks rather than the airlines, the Legislature probably would have acted to prevent such tax avoidance (e.g., \u00a7 235). But the only question we may decide is whether sections 1150 to 1156 achieve this result. We conclude that nothing in the language or legislative history of these sections is addressed to the tax consequences of the alleged ownership of certificated aircraft by banks and financial corporations. The trial court improperly granted summary judgment on the basis of sections 1150 to 1156.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>The judgment is reversed.

In assessing tax on aircraft, no distinction is made between aircraft owned by the airlines and aircraft that may technically be leased from another party when such aircraft is operated by the air carrier as part of its regular air fleet. Rather, all aircraft operated under the certificate of an air carrier are treated the same. [\u00b6] Property taxes on aircraft operated under the certificate of an air carrier are <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>assessed as follows. A separate calculation is made for each aircraft type operated by a particular carrier (e.g., Boeing 747, DC-10). The assessor first determines the total time (in minutes) which aircraft of that type operated by the carrier actually spend within a taxing authority during the representative time period. Then the assessor determines the total possible number of minutes during the same time period for <em>all </em>aircraft of that type operated by the carrier as part of its fleet anywhere in the world. This percentage (in-state time divided by total possible time) is multiplied by .75, since the time in state factor is 75%, and is then applied to the total value of an air carrier\u2019s world-wide fleet of the aircraft. . . . [\u00b6] Similarly, to calculate the arrivals and departures factor, the assessor begins by ascertaining the total number of takeoffs and landings within a taxing authority during the representative period. He then determines the total number of takeoffs and landings in the same time period by all planes of the type operated by the airline as part of its fleet anywhere in the world. The instate number is multiplied by the total number. This percentage is multiplied by .25 (to reflect the statutory weighting factor). [[[] The time in state and arrivals/departures allocation ratios of total fleet value are added together, and applied to the total value of an air carrier\u2019s worldwide fleet of the aircraft type.
