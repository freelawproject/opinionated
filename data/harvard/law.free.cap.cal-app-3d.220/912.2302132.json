Code, \u00a7 11351) and transportation of cocaine (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7 11352). In a separate proceeding tried before the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"914\">*914</page-number>same jury, forfeiture of $14,930 in cash seized from appellant at the time of his arrest was ordered. Appellant has filed appeals from both judgments.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">Appellant was arrested on October 16, 1987, by Officer David Helm of the Hayward Police Department Drug Task Force, who was \u201cpatrolling high drug traffic areas\u201d in an unmarked vehicle with his partner, Officer Rick Gallia. At about 10 that evening, Officer Helm observed appellant exit the driver\u2019s side of his car, which was parked by the pumps at a gas station. As appellant walked toward the cashier\u2019s office, he was \u201cstaggering\u201d and \u201cvery unsteady on his feet.\u201d From the cashier\u2019s booth, appellant walked to a nearby intersection, where he \u201cappeared to be flagging people down.\u201d \u201cHe was talking and moving his arms about.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">Officer Helm believed appellant might be under the influence of narcotics, so he approached and made contact. Appellant was \u201cvery hyperactive\u201d; his pulse and speech rate were rapid; he had a \u201cwide-eyed stare\u201d; his pupils appeared \u201cvery dilated\u201d; and he \u201cconstantly licked his lips.\u201d The officer concluded that appellant was under the influence of a \u201ccontrolled stimulant,\u201d and arrested him.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">Appellant was handcuffed and placed in the backseat of the patrol vehicle. On appellant\u2019s person was found a \u201cpager.\u201d From under the driver\u2019s seat of appellant\u2019s car was seized a clear plastic baggie containing \u201capproximately 14 grams\u201d of a white powdery substance later determined to be cocaine. In the trunk of the car the officer discovered cash in the amount of $14,930, mostly in $20 bills or smaller denominations.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-7\">Appellant testified at trial that he did not know cocaine was in his vehicle. He had not driven the car for a few days before his arrest; it had been loaned to the brother of Michelle Gibson, with whom he lived in San Francisco. He is a commercial truck driver by occupation, and during the week drove his \u201cWhite Freightliner\u201d truck rather than his car. On the evening of his arrest, he had been at a family dinner at his sister\u2019s house in Union City. He was returning home around 9:30 p.m., when his pager sounded and he went to the gas station to make a telephone call. It was not unusual for him to receive \u201cbeeper calls\u201d at night as part of his trucking business. He did not stagger, wave his arms, or otherwise engage in hyperactive behavior before his arrest. Appellant admitted ownership of the cash found in the trunk of his car, much of which, he claimed, was borrowed from his uncle to finance the purchase of a new truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"915\">*915</page-number>Michelle Gibson confirmed that she loaned appellant\u2019s car to her brother a few days before appellant\u2019s arrest. She also testified that she called appellant \u201con his beeper\u201d the night of his arrest. Appellant\u2019s uncle testified that in the early part of January 1987 he loaned appellant $10,000 in cash, which appellant intended to use it to buy a truck.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">\n<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">Appellant\u2019s final contention is that, in the forfeiture proceeding, the trial court should have given, sua sponte, a unanimity instruction in the terms of CALJIC No. 17.01. <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> He argues that the jury may have found that his money was subject to forfeiture under Health and Safety Code section 11470 (hereafter section 11470)<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cfor any one of three distinct acts\u201d; and that, therefore, he was entitled to a unanimity instruction to insure that the jurors agreed on the particular act comprising the offense for which forfeiture was ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">Where the evidence shows that several criminal acts may have been committed and the defendant is not charged separately with a violation of all those acts, the trial court is required, sua sponte, to instruct the jurors that they must unanimously agree beyond a reasonable doubt upon the particular act constituting the crime. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Diedrich </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 263, 280-281 [182 Cal.Rptr. 354, 643 P.2d 971]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Meyer </em>(1988) 197 Cal.App.3d 1307, 1310-1311 [243 Cal.Rptr. 533]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Gordon </em>(1985) 165 Cal.App.3d 839, 853 [212 Cal.Rptr. 174].) The purpose of this rule is to insure that all jurors agree beyond a reasonable doubt that one particular act or acts constitute the crime charged. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Parsons </em>(1984) 156 Cal.App.3d 1165, 1173 [203 Cal.Rptr. 412]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Deletto </em>(1983) 147 Cal.App.3d 458, 471-472 [195 Cal.Rptr. 233].) Without CALJIC No. 17.01, some jurors might believe the defendant committed one act, while other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>jurors base their verdict on another act, thereby violating the fundamental principle that a criminal conviction requires a unanimous jury verdict. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Wesley </em>(1986) 177 Cal.App.3d 397, 401 [223 Cal.Rptr. 9]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Deletto, supra, </em>147 Cal.App.3d 458, 471.)</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">The Attorney General responds that the forfeiture proceeding against appellant under section 11470 was \u201ccivil in nature,\u201d and did not require juror unanimity. Respondent observes that only nine jurors were required to agree on the verdict, and unanimity as to the \u201cexact legal theory of forfeiture\u201d was not necessary. To address this issue, we must examine the nature of forfeiture proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">The forfeiture proceeding against appellant was prosecuted as a separate civil action under section 11470 et seq. Subdivision (f) of section 11470, pursuant to which the order of forfeiture was obtained, includes within the items subject to forfeiture: \u201cAll moneys, negotiable instruments, securities, or other things of value furnished or intended to be furnished by any person in exchange for a controlled substance, all proceeds traceable to such an exchange, and all moneys, negotiable instruments, or securities used or intended to be used to facilitate any violation [of enumerated controlled substance laws] . . . .\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Moraza) </em>(1989) 210 Cal.App.3d 592, 596 fn. 2 [258 Cal.Rptr. 499].) Section 11488.4 provides for filing of a petition of forfeiture by the district attorney of the county in which property subject to forfeiture has been seized. The forfeiture hearing must be \u201cby jury, unless waived by consent of all parties.\u201d (\u00a7 11488.5, subd. (c)(2).) Subdivision (e) of section 11488.5 states that the forfeiture hearing \u201cshall be conducted in accordance with Sections 600 to 630, inclusive, of the <em>Code of Civil Procedure </em>if a trial by jury, and by Sections 631 to 636, inclusive, of the <em>Code of Civil Procedure </em>if by court.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b728-6\">Forfeiture is ordered \u201cwhen, at the hearing, the state or local governmental entity has shown that the assets in question are subject to forfeiture pursuant to Section 11470, in accordance with the burden of proof set forth in subdivision (i) of section 11488.4.\u201d (\u00a7 11488.5, subd. (d).) At the time appellant was arrested and tried, subdivision (i) of section 11488.4 required proof \u201cbeyond a reasonable doubt that the property for which forfeiture is sought meets the criteria for forfeiture described in subdivision (f) of Section 11470,\u201d (\u00a7 11488.4, subd. (i)(2))<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> and made conviction of the underlying criminal offense a prerequisite to forfeiture. The current version of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>statute eliminates the conviction requirement, and demands proof \u201cby a preponderance of the evidence that the property is subject to forfeiture as described in Section 11470.\u201d (\u00a7 11488.4, subd. (i); see also <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Moraza), supra, </em>210 Cal.App.3d 592, 597.)</p>\n<p id=\"b729-5\">The California forfeiture statutes do not provide for forfeiture as punishment for the underlying offense. The criminal charging document need not allege forfeiture; the forfeiture proceeding is initiated by a separate petition. (Cf. <em>U.S. </em>v. <em>Seifuddin </em>(9th Cir. 1987) 820 F.2d 1074, 1978.) The forfeiture hearing is conducted pursuant to civil rather than criminal rules of procedure. (\u00a7 11488.5, subd. (e).)</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">By specifically referring to Code of Civil Procedure sections 600 to 630 to govern forfeiture proceedings (\u00a7 11488.5, subd. (e))<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>, the Legislature provided a clear indication that such proceedings are <em>civil </em>in nature. Juror unanimity is not required for a verdict of forfeiture; in civil actions, a verdict may be based upon agreement of only three-fourths of the jurors. (Code Civ. Proc., \u00a7\u00a7 613, 618.) The trial court is given discretion to instruct the jury on its own motion under Code of Civil Procedure section 608, which provides: \u201cIn charging the jury, the court <em>may </em>state to them all matters of law which it thinks necessary for their information in giving their verdict . . . .\u201d (Italics added.) In a civil case, \u201ceach of the parties must propose complete and comprehensive instructions in accordance with his theory of the litigation; if the parties do not do so, the court owes no duty to instruct on its own motion.\u201d <em>(Switzer </em>v. <em>State of California </em>(1969) 269 Cal.App.2d 627, 635 [75 Cal.Rptr. 371]; see also <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>City of Los Angeles </em>(1980) 109 Cal.App.3d 625, 635 [167 Cal.Rptr. 320]; <em>Gagosian </em>v. <em>Burdick\u2019s Television &amp; Appliances </em>(1967) 254 Cal.App.2d 316, 318 [62 Cal.Rptr. 70].) Only the complete failure to instruct properly on a basic issue may constitute reversible error. (See <em>Lysick </em>v. <em>Walcom </em>(1968) 258 Cal.App.2d 136, 157 [65 Cal.Rptr. 406, 28 A.L.R.3d 368]; <em>Thomas </em>v. <em>Buttress &amp; McClellan, Inc. </em>(1956) 141 Cal.App.2d 812, 819 [297 P.2d 768]; 7 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (3d ed. 1985) Trial, \u00a7 243, pp. 249-250.)</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">We accordingly conclude that the trial court did not commit prejudicial error by failing to give CALJIC No. 17.01 on its own motion in the civil forfeiture action.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>The judgments are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">Racanelli, P.

It is not necessary that the particular [act] [or] [omission] agreed upon be stated in your verdict.\u201d CALJIC 4.71.5 is substantially similar.
