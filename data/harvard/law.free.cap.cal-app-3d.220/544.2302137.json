Code, \u00a7\u00a7 664, 187)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and assault with a firearm (\u00a7 245, subd. (a)(2)). The jury also found that he acted willfully, deliberately and with premeditation (\u00a7\u00a7 189 and 664, subd. 1), used a handgun during the offenses (\u00a7\u00a7 12022.5 and 1203.06, subd. (a)(1)(i)) and intentionally inflicted great bodily injury on the victim (\u00a7 12022.7). After finding him sane at the time of the offenses, and denying his motion for new trial, Douglas was sentenced to state prison for a life term with a consecutive five-year term for the gun use and great bodily injury enhancements. Sentence was stayed on the assault charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">Douglas contends that the trial court erred by failing to instruct the jury on the offense of attempted second degree murder. He further asserts that the jury\u2019s failure to specify the degree of the offense established the crime as attempted second degree murder as a matter of law and, thus, the trial court lacked jurisdiction to impose sentence for other than attempted second degree murder. We find both of these arguments based on the erroneous premise that there exists a crime of \u201cattempted second degree murder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\">\n<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b428-9\">Facts</p>\n<p id=\"b428-10\">Alexander Douglas lived in a dormitory at the Veteran\u2019s Home in Yountville. Alfreda, a volunteer at the home, and Douglas became romantically involved and spent the evening of July 1 and the morning of July 2, 1987, together at her home. In the morning Douglas called Alfreda names and accused her of \u201crunning around with three other men,\u201d specifically naming Ralph Colin, another resident of the home. Alfreda drove Douglas back to the Veteran\u2019s Home later that morning. He was still upset and told her he never wanted to see her again.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"547\">*547</page-number>Upon returning to his dormitory at the Veteran\u2019s Home, Douglas told Colin that he had a present for him which he would give him later. Douglas seemed normal to Colin; he did not raise his voice. Later that morning, Douglas asked Norman Spencer, another resident of the Veteran\u2019s Home, for a ride to San Francisco. Spencer first drove Douglas to the dormitory where he waited outside while Douglas went inside to collect some belongings. Douglas seemed normal to Spencer.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">Inside the dormitory Douglas asked Colin to follow him in order to get the present. Colin went with him and stood about six feet from Douglas as he opened his locker. Douglas said he had the present as he turned around displaying a gun in his hand. Douglas backed into the middle of the hall, called Colin a \u201cchiseler,\u201d and ordered him to turn around. Nicholas Vratari, who was also present in the dorm, looked up and saw Douglas holding a gun. Douglas then said to Colin, \u201cI\u2019ll teach you to two-time on me,\u201d and shot him in the back of the neck. Douglas ordered Vratari to leave, threatening to shoot him if he did not.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-6\">Spencer, who was waiting in the car, did not hear the gunshot nor did he see a gun when Douglas came out of the dorm. They drove to San Francisco where Spencer left Douglas.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-7\">Douglas knew Alfreda kept a gun under her mattress. After the shooting, she discovered the gun was missing.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-8\">Colin remained hospitalized for three days. The bullet had entered through the right side of his neck, missed all of the major structures and exited through the front. Colin sustained muscle damage to his neck and back. Had the bullet traveled a slightly different path, however, Colin could have sustained partial to complete paralysis or death.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-9\">Douglas was arrested in Las Vegas, Nevada, on October 3, 1988, 15 months after he shot Colin and threatened Vratari.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-10\">In his defense Douglas testified that he loved Alfreda and had seen Colin with her at a dance. On June 29, 1987, he hurt his back and was prescribed Tylenol and codeine. By July 1, the pain from his back was \u201cdriving [him] crazy.\u201d He was angry with Alfreda because she wanted to go to a dance at the home and leave him at her house. He denied that he was angry about Alfreda\u2019s relations with other men and denied stealing her gun. By July 2, Douglas was still in pain and took some of the medication. He could not remember how many pills he took or when he last took the medication. He recalled Alfreda driving him back to the Veteran\u2019s Home, where he deposited one check and cashed another. The last thing Douglas remembered was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"548\">*548</page-number>having a discussion with Colin. Months later, in Nevada, he regained consciousness. He did not remember telling Colin about a present, anything about the shooting, or how he managed to get from the Veteran\u2019s Home in Yountville to Nevada.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">\n<em>I. Are There Degrees of Attempted Murder?</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">Douglas claims that the crime of attempted murder is divided into degrees. From this premise he argues that attempted second degree murder is a lesser-included offense of willful, deliberate and premeditated attempted murder; in other words, of attempted first degree murder. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Wickersham </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 307, 329-330 [185 Cal.Rptr. 436, 650 P.2d 311]; <em>Stone </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1982) 31 Cal.3d 503, 517 [183 Cal.Rptr. 647, 646 P.2d 809].) Douglas defines attempted second degree murder as an attempted killing of a human being with specific intent to kill and express malice aforethought; the crime does not require proof of premeditation and deliberation. <em>(Wickersham, </em>supra, at p. 330.) Respondent, relying on <em>People </em>v. <em>Wein </em>(1977) 69 Cal.App.3d 79, 93 [137 Cal.Rptr. 814], and <em>People </em>v. <em>Macias </em>(1982) 137 Cal.App.3d 465, 471-472 [187 Cal.Rptr. 100], argues that there is only a single crime of attempted murder, not distinguished by degrees.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">At the time of the <em>Wein </em>and <em>Macias </em>decisions, Penal Code section 664, subdivision 1, provided for the same length of imprisonment\u2014either from one to twenty years at the time of <em>Wein, </em>or for five, seven or nine years at the time of Macias\u2014if the completed crime carried a maximum life sentence. Since both first and second degree murder carry potential life sentences, the law imposed a uniform punishment for attempted murder, regardless of the degree. Thus, the continued validity of the holdings of the <em>Wein </em>and <em>Macias </em>cases, that the crime of attempted murder is not divided into degrees, can be questioned, since the Legislature amended section 664, subdivision 1, in 1986. The statute now provides for a punishment of life in prison with the possibility of parole for an attempted murder which was willful, deliberate and premeditated; however, if the attempted murder is not specifically found to be willful, deliberate and premeditated, it is punishable by imprisonment for five, seven, or nine years.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Penal Code section 664, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>which governs attempted crimes, provides at subdivision 4 that an attempt may be of any degree of the underlying crime, and the punishment shall be determined as provided by that section.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">The Legislature did not necessarily create different degrees of attempted murder by imposing different penalties. It can provide for varied punishments for a single crime depending on factors involved in the commission of that offense without dividing it into degrees. For example, the punishment for grand theft varies widely depending upon the nature of the articles stolen.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Kidnapping is generally punishable by imprisonment for three, five, or eight years, but if the person kidnapped is under 14 years of age, the kidnapper faces imprisonment for five, eight, or eleven years. (\u00a7 208.) In neither of these examples did the Legislature silently create degrees of grand theft (itself the greater degree of the crime of theft) or kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-6\">The imposition of separate penalties for different levels of culpability for attempted murder may resemble the degree gradations of the completed crime; however, the power to define criminal conduct and determine penalties is exclusively vested in the legislative branch, subject to constitutional provisions. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Dillon </em>(1983) 34 Cal.3d 441, 477-478 [194 Cal.Rptr. 390, 668 P.2d 697].) The division of a crime into degrees carries more than linguistic significance. It requires an exacting degree of specificity in the jury verdict, court determination or guilty plea. (E.g., \u00a7\u00a7 1097, 1157, 1192-1192.2.)  Accordingly\u2014and in view of the broad impact of the \u201cdegree\u201d distinction\u2014we construe section 664, subdivision 1 narrowly and do not find degrees of attempted murder where the Legislature has not expressly provided for same.</p>\n<p id=\"b431-7\">Our determination that attempted murder is not divided into degrees disposes of Douglas\u2019s assignment of error to the trial court\u2019s failure to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>instruct on attempted second degree murder. The instructions given amply informed the jury of its tasks and choices under section 664, subdivision 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">The trial court instructed the jury with a slightly modified form of CALJIC No. 8.66, the general attempted murder instruction. It requires a specific intent to kill (malice) and a direct act towards that end; it does not include the elements of premeditation or deliberation which would justify imposition of the greater penalty under section 664. The court then gave CALJIC No. 8.67, which instructed the jury that if they determined that Douglas had committed attempted murder, they then must make a specific finding on whether the offense was willful, deliberate and premeditated. The verdict forms later given to the jury provided for such a specific finding. CALJIC No. 8.67 sufficiently distinguishes the different elements necessary for imposition of either of the punishments under section 664, subdivision 1, regardless of whether those punishments establish different degrees of attempted murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">Douglas\u2019s final contention in this regard is that the jury did not find the degree of his offense and, by virtue of section 1157, he was, by implication, found guilty of attempted second degree murder. Section 1157 provides that if the jury fails to determine the degree of a crime, the defendant shall be deemed guilty of the lesser degree. The statute, by its terms, affects only the conviction of \u201ca crime which is distinguished into degrees,\u201d and accordingly finds no application here.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">The jury\u2019s specific findings were sufficient for imposition of the higher penalty. Among its other findings, the jury found Douglas guilty of attempted murder and that the attempted murder was committed willfully, deliberately and with premeditation within the meaning of sections 189 and 664, subdivision 1. In the absence of a crime specifically separated into degrees, the jury\u2019s finding of special circumstances warrants the imposition of the higher penalty as a matter of law. (Cf. <em>People </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1984) 157 Cal.App.3d 145, 153-154 [203 Cal.Rptr. 562].)</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">\n<footnotemark>*</footnotemark>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b432-9\">The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-10\">Racanelli, P.
