He appeals the denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241 petition in which he asserted that one of his judgments of conviction was invalid because the district court dismissed all of the counts contained therein and that, therefore, the Bureau of Prisons did not have the authority to incarcerate him for 219 months. Mitchell previously has filed one untimely 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion and two unsuccessful \u00a7 2241 petitions.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">The district court correctly determined that Mitchell\u2019s allegations of sentencing error are not cognizable in a \u00a7 2241 petition. <em>See Reyes-Requena v. United States, </em>243 F.3d 893, 900 (5th Cir.2001); <em>Tolliver v. Dobre, </em>211 F.3d 876, 877 (5th Cir.2000). Mitchell may challenge his conviction under \u00a7 2241 only if he establishes that \u201cthe remedy [under \u00a7 2255] is inadequate or ineffective to test the legality of his detention.\u201d \u00a7 2255(e); <em>see Jeffers v. Chandler, </em>253 F.3d 827, 830 (5th Cir.2001) (citing <em>Reyes-Requena, </em>243 F.3d at 904). Mitchell does not rely upon a retroactively applicable Supreme Court decision that establishes that he is actually innocent. Thus, he fails to demonstrate that the remedy under \u00a7 2255 is inadequate. <em>See Jeffers, </em>253 F.3d at 830-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">We caution Mitchell that any future frivolous, repetitive, or otherwise abusive filings may result in the imposition of sanctions, including dismissal, monetary sanctions, and restrictions on his ability to file pleadings in this court or any court subject to this court\u2019s jurisdiction. The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED, Mitchell\u2019s motion to appoint counsel is DENIED, and a SANCTION WARNING IS ISSUED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b433-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
