We affirmed his convictions on direct appeal. Stutts now appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. The district court granted a certificate of appealability (COA) on Stutts\u2019s \u201cineffective assistance of counsel claim arising from counsel\u2019s alleged failure to investigate.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b344-14\">Stutts argues that his trial counsel\u2019s representation was deficient because counsel failed to investigate and offer trial testimony of witnesses who were present when the alleged drug transactions took place. He also contends that counsel failed to investigate the layout of the tire shop where three of the four alleged drug transactions occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-15\">For purposes of analysis, the district court assumed that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that counsel should have investigated and presented evidence of the layout of the shop and the testimony of the employees in the shop. The district court was not persuaded that Stutts had shown prejudice. The district court\u2019s conclusion is based on its review of the surveillance videotapes which showed that the employees were not in the bay area or the office at all times but were often outside where they would not have been in a position to see what was happening in the shop bay. The district court notes that on the day of the first buy, two employees were sitting in chairs outside the shop while Stutts and Ward were inside. On another video, the district court notes that Eugene \u201cShorty\u201d Jones could be seen moving back and forth inside and outside of the shop moving tires and rims and assisting customers. The district court concluded that the \u201cvideotapes thus belie the suggestion that a transaction did not occur because employees did not see the transaction occur. Certainly, it cannot be said that there exists a reasonable probability that the out<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>come of the trial would have been different had trial counsel presented evidence of the shop layout and testimony of shop employees.\u201d The district court further noted from its review of the videos that Ward \u201cmade no effort to hide from Stutts\u2019s employees either his occupation as a drug dealer or that he was at the tire shop to do drug business with Stutts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b345-5\">Stutts\u2019s only challenge to the district court\u2019s subsidiary findings regarding the content of the videos is the following sentence: \u201cThe error in the district court\u2019s analysis is that these employees or other employees were in the shop at times when the alleged drug transactions occurred.\u201d Stutts\u2019s assertion is significant because he does not allege that the employees were in the shop at \u201call\u201d times. The employees were inside the shop some of the time but not all of the time as they went about their work. Stutts\u2019s one sentence assertion is not sufficient to show that the district court\u2019s factual finding is clearly erroneous. <em>See United States v. Molina-Uribe, </em>429 F.3d 514, 518 (5th Cir.2005). Given all of the evidence against Stutts, and given counsel\u2019s other efforts to show that Ward had a grudge against Stutts and had the opportunity to plant the drugs ahead of time, a defense which the jury rejected, we reach the same independent conclusion as the district court that Stutts has not shown prejudice. <em>See id. </em>at 518-19.</p>\n<p id=\"b345-6\">Stutts also argues that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to advise him properly of his right to testify at trial and for failing to meet with him an adequate amount of time prior to trial. However, the district court granted a COA only on the issue of counsels\u2019 failure to investigate, thus implicitly denying a COA as to all other issues. Although Stutts has briefed the two issues for which the district court did not grant and thus implicitly denied a COA, he has not expressly requested this court to grant a COA on those issues, either in his brief or in a separate motion for a COA. Therefore, we may not consider these issues. <em>See Lackey v. Johnson, </em>116 F.3d 149, 151 (5th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Kimler, </em>150 F.3d 429, 431 and n. 1 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b345-8\">The district court\u2019s denial of Stutts\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b344-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
