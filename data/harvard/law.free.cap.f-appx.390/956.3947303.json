The amended complaint alleges that Willow Lake selectively enforced its regulations regarding home and lawn appearance, terminated Wells and Sims\u2019 lease, and initiated eviction proceedings because both of them are disabled (Count 1) and because Sim is Indonesian (Count 2). The amended complaint also alleges that the same discriminatory behavior violated Florida Statute \u00a7 723.061 (Count 3) and supported a common law duress claim (Count 4). The district court dismissed the amended complaint for failing to state a claim, and this<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> appeal followed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b983-22\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s decision to dismiss a complaint for failure <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"958\">*958</page-number>to state a claim. <em>Hill v. White, </em>321 F.3d 1334, 1335 (11th Cir.2003). In doing so, we view the complaint in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs, and accept all of its well-pleaded facts as true. <em>Am. United Life Ins. Co. v. Martinez, </em>480 F.3d 1043, 1057 (11th Cir.2007). \u201cCourts do and should show a leniency to pro se litigants not enjoyed by those with the benefit of a legal education.\u201d <em>GJR Invs., Inc. v. County of Escambia, Fla., </em>132 F.3d 1359, 1369 (11th Cir.1998). However, \u201cthis leniency does not give a court license to serve as de facto counsel for a party, or to rewrite an otherwise deficient pleading in order to sustain an action.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-4\">The FHA provides that it is unlawful to \u201cdiscriminate against any person in the terms, conditions, or privileges of sale or rental of a dwelling, or in the provision of services or facilities\u201d based on that person\u2019s national origin or handicap. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3604(b), (f)(2). Discrimination on the basis of a handicap includes \u201ca refusal to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services, when such accommodations may be necessary to afford such person equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3604(f)(3)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b984-5\">The district court dismissed Sim\u2019s FHA claim of disability discrimination because he has not adequately pleaded that he is a \u201chandicapped\u201d individual. The FHA defines \u201chandicap\u201d as \u201c(1) a physical or mental impairment which substantially limits one or more of such person\u2019s major life activities, (2) a record of having such an impairment, or (3) being regarded as having such an impairment.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 3602(h). Because Sim merely contends that he \u201ccannot bend or move easily,\u201d the district court concluded that he has not alleged a \u201csubstantial limitation\u201d to a major life activity. The district court cited case law that \u201csomeone who walks, sits, stands or sleeps \u2018moderately below average\u2019 is not disabled under the Act,\u201d Ross<em>bach v. City of Miami, </em>371 F.3d 1354, 1358 (11th Cir.2004). Instead of challenging that reasoning, however, Sim merely asserts in passing that he has already addressed all three required elements to show disability. We agree with the district court that Sim has not adequately pleaded that he is a handicapped individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-8\">The district court concluded that Wells, unlike Sim, has adequately alleged that she is handicapped.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The court, however, dismissed Wells\u2019 claim of disability discrimination because it concluded that she has no standing to sue under the FHA. Because the district court also relied on that rationale in dismissing Sim\u2019s FHA claim of national origin discrimination, we will discuss the standing issues for each plaintiff in the same place.</p>\n<p id=\"b984-9\">The Supreme Court has held that \u201cCongress intended standing under [the FHA] to extend to the full limits of Article III\u201d of the United States Constitution. <em>Gladstone, Realtors v. Village of Bellwood, </em>441 U.S. 91, 103 n. 9, 99 S.Ct. 1601, 1609 n. 9, 60 L.Ed.2d 66 (1979); <em>see also Havens Realty Corp. v. Coleman, </em>455 U.S. 363, 372, 102 S.Ct. 1114, 1121, 71 L.Ed.2d 214 (1982). \u201cStanding under Article III has three elements: (1) the plaintiff must have suffered an injury in fact- \u2014 an invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and particularized and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical; (2) there must be a causal connection between the injury and the conduct complained of \u2014 the injury has to be fairly traceable to the challenged action of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"959\">*959</page-number>defendant, and not the result of the independent action of some third party not before the court; and (3) it must be likely, as opposed to merely speculative, that the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision.\u201d <em>Fla. Family Policy Council v. Freeman, </em>561 F.3d 1246, 1253 (11th Cir.2009) (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b985-5\">The district court found that neither Wells nor Sim had alleged an \u201cactual or imminent\u201d injury because they had not yet been evicted from the mobile home park, but were instead involved in a pending state eviction proceeding. We disagree. \u201c[A]lthough a plaintiff must establish a realistic danger of sustaining a direct injury ..., he does not have to await the consummation of threatened injury to obtain preventive relief.\u201d <em>Fla. State Conference of NAACP v. Browning, </em>522 F.3d 1153, 1161 (11th Cir.2008). Here, eviction is a \u201crealistic danger\u201d because Willow Lakes has notified Wells and Sim that it intends to terminate their tenancy. <em>See Yesler Terrace Cmty. Council v. Cisneros, </em>37 F.3d 442, 446-47 (9th Cir.1994) (holding that a threat of eviction is \u201cconcrete and personal\u201d danger to interests of residents sufficient to comprise injury in fact); <em>Richmond Tenants Organization, Inc. v. Kemp, </em>956 F.2d 1300, 1305-06 (4th Cir.1992) (holding that \u201cactual threat\u201d of eviction was enough to confer standing because \u201cthere was a realistic danger that the plaintiffs would suffer actual injury\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b985-6\">Moreover, the possibility of eviction is not the only injury from which Wells and Sim seek relief. They both allege that they have <em>already </em>been forced to spend time and money complying with regulations that Willow Lakes has selectively enforced against them. That is an injury in fact. In addition, Wells alleges that Willow Lakes denied her request for reasonable accommodation in complying with those regulations. That act of alleged discrimination is also an injury in fact. <em>See Fulton v. Goord, </em>591 F.3d 37, 42 (2d Cir.2009) (\u201c[The plaintiff] asserts that she was discriminatorily denied a reasonable accommodation for her disability in violation of her rights under the [ADA and the Rehabilitation Acts]. This is plainly an injury in fact that is sufficient to form the basis for Article III standing.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b985-8\">The district court also found that Wells and Sim had not alleged a causal link between their respective injuries and any unlawful conduct. The court pointed out that the two admitted that they had violated mandatory park regulations and had failed to cure some of those violations before Willow Lake delivered the termination letters. The court concluded that because \u201cit appears that Defendants had a proper basis\u201d for their actions, Wells and Sim could not establish a causal link between their respective injuries and any <em>unlawful </em>conduct by the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b985-9\">The district court, however, apparently did not accept Wells\u2019 and Sim\u2019s well-pleaded allegations as true, which it was required to do at this stage of the proceedings. <em>See Am. United Life Ins. Co., </em>480 F.3d at 1057. The amended complaint may have appeared weak to the district court, but that is not a matter of Article III standing. The court also did not address the claim that the defendants had selectively enforced the regulations as a pretext for disability and national origin discrimination. Although Wells and Sim admit that their trailer had violated the regulations cited by Willow Lake, the amended complaint does allege: that Wells is the only disabled resident living in the mobile home community (besides Sim, whose disability discrimination claim we have rejected on other grounds); that Sim is the only Indonesian resident living in the mobile home community; that the regulations were being applied against them because of Wells\u2019 disability and Sim\u2019s na<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"960\">*960</page-number>tional origin; that their mobile home park contains 389 lots but their lot is the only-one that has been targeted by the defendants; and that photographic evidence proves that Willow Lake has not issued violations against similarly situated owners. Those allegations are specific, factual, and plausible enough to satisfy the pleading standard of Rule 8 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. <em>See generally Ashcroft v. Iqbal, </em>556 U.S.-, 129 S.Ct. 1937, 173 L.Ed.2d 868 (2009); <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 555, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b986-6\">If those allegations are true, the defendants have discriminated against Wells on the basis of disability and against Sim on the basis of national origin. <em>See Schwarz v. City of Treasure Island, </em>544 F.3d 1201, 1216 (11th Cir.2008) (\u201cAs its name suggests, a disparate treatment claim requires a plaintiff to show that he [or she] has actually been treated differently than similarly situated non-handicapped people.\u201d). And there would be a causal connection between the injuries and that illegal conduct. <em>See Fla. Family Policy Council, </em>561 F.3d at 1253. Wells and Sim therefore each have standing; Wells has stated a valid claim for disability discrimination under the FHA, and Sim has stated a valid claim for national origin discrimination under the FHA.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-7\">The district court also dismissed with prejudice Wells and Sims\u2019 state law claims, concluding that Fla. Stat. \u00a7 723.061 does not give rise to an independent cause of action (Count 3), and that they had failed to allege the requisite elements of a cause of action for duress (Count 4). In their brief to this Court, Wells and Sim make no arguments concerning the district court\u2019s dismissal of their state law claims, which are therefore deemed abandoned. <em>See Timson v. Sampson, </em>518 F.3d 870, 874 (11th Cir.2008) (issues not briefed on appeal by a pro se litigant are deemed abandoned); <em>Horsley v. Feldt, </em>304 F.3d 1125, 1131 n. 1 (11th Cir.2002) (same); <em>Rowe v. Schreiber, </em>139 F.3d 1381, 1382 n. 1 (11th Cir.1998) (an issue may be deemed abandoned where a party only mentions it in passing, without providing substantive argument in support).</p>\n<p id=\"b986-9\">We therefore REVERSE the district court\u2019s dismissal of Wells\u2019 claim under Count 1 of the amended complaint, as well as its dismissal of Count 2. We AFFIRM the district court\u2019s dismissal of Sim\u2019s claim under Count 1, as well as its dismissal of Count 3 and Count 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b986-10\">AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART AND REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b983-10\">. The defendants contend, in passing, that we lack subject matter jurisdiction because Wells and Sim admit in their brief that the value of their property is less than $25,000. That argument is frivolous. There is no amount-in-controversy requirement in this federal question jurisdiction case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b984-6\">. The defendants briefly contend that Wells has also failed to adequately plead that she is a handicapped individual. We reject that argument for the reasons stated by the district court.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
