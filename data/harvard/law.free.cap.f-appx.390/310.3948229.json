Cook, Texas prisoner # 1427038, appeals the dismissal of his in forma pau-peris 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint for failure to protect as frivolous and for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. Cook filed suit against various prison officials and Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) officials. He alleged that he had been threatened by members of the Aryan Brotherhood and that the defendants failed to provide the requisite protection. Cook also filed numerous motions for injunction relief, requesting that he be placed in federal protective custody or not be placed in the general prison population.</p>\n<p id=\"b336-21\">The magistrate judge (MJ) recommended dismissing Cook\u2019s claims against two prison officials because he had not shown that they were \u201cindifferent to his safety\u201d or that he was \u201cincarcerated under conditions posing a substantial risk of serious harm,\u201d as required to state a claim for failure to protect under the Eighth Amendment. <em>Neals v. Norwood, </em>59 F.3d 530, 533 (5th Cir.1995). The MJ recommended dismissing Cook\u2019s claims against the warden and the TDCJ officials because he had not established that they had any personal involvement in his classification or placement. The MJ recommended denying Cook\u2019s motions for injunctive relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>Cook filed timely objections to the MJ\u2019s recommendations; however, in adopting the MJ\u2019s recommendations, the district court incorrectly noted that Cook had not filed objections, dismissed his suit, and denied injunctive relief. Cook then filed two motions to \u201creinstate\u201d his case. After Cook filed his brief in this court, the district court granted his motions to reconsider. However, after a de novo review, the district court denied his motion to reinstate his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-5\">Cook\u2019s liberally construed brief, <em>see Grant v. Cuellar, </em>59 F.3d 523, 524 (5th Cir.1995), raises three arguments: (1) that simply because he filed timely objections to the MJ\u2019s recommendation, his case should proceed to trial; (2) that he stated a claim for failure to protect; and (3) that the district court should have considered his objections to the MJ\u2019s recommendation before dismissing his complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b337-6\">This court reviews dismissals for failure to state a claim under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) de novo, using the same standard applicable to dismissals pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). <em>See Black v. Warren, </em>134 F.3d 732, 733-34 (5th Cir.1998). This court reviews dismissals under \u00a7 1915A de novo as well. <em>Ruiz v. United States, </em>160 F.3d 273, 275 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-7\">Cook\u2019s first argument is without merit because the district court dismissed his complaint because there was no clear error in the MJ\u2019s recommendation, not solely because he failed to file objections. Cook\u2019s second argument is likewise without merit because he has failed to show that he was \u201cincarcerated under conditions posing a substantial risk of serious harm and that prison officials were deliberately indifferent to his need for protection.\u201d <em>Neals, </em>59 F.3d at 533. Cook has also failed to show personal involvement on the part of the warden and the TDCJ officials. <em>Lozano v. Smith, </em>718 F.2d 756, 768 (5th Cir.1983). Cook\u2019s third argument is unavailing because the district court considered his objections when granting his motions to reconsider and denying his motion to reinstate his case; thus, any error in failing to consider his objections is harmless. <em>See Smith v. Collins, </em>964 F.2d 483, 485 (5th Cir.1992). Finally, Cook has not shown that the district court abused its discretion in denying injunctive relief. <em>Nichols v. Alcatel USA Inc., </em>532 F.3d 364, 372 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b337-9\">AFFIRMED</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b336-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
