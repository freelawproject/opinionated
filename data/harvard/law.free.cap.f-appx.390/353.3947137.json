The BIA concluded that Bayavarpu, who did not apply for asylum, had not demonstrated eligibility for withholding of removal because Bayavarpu \u201cfailed to show a clear probability of future persecution on account of a ground protected under the [Immigration and Nationality] Act.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">We review the BIA\u2019s legal conclusions de novo \u201cunless a conclusion embodies the [BIA\u2019s] interpretation of an ambiguous provision of a statute that it administers; a conclusion of the latter type is entitled to the deference prescribed by <em>Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council.\u201d</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> Singh v. Gonzales, </em>436 F.3d 484, 487 (5th Cir.2006) (footnotes omitted). \u201cFactual findings are reviewed for substantial evidence, which requires only that the BIA\u2019s decisions be supported by record evidence and be substantially reasonable.\u201d <em>Shaikh v. Holder, 588 </em>F.3d 861, 863 (5th Cir.2009) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">\u201c[W]ithholding of removal is a mandatory form of relief if an alien\u2019s life or freedom would be threatened in the country of removal because of the alien\u2019s race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cAn alien must establish that race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion was or will be at least <em>one central reason for persecuting </em>the applicant.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">Bayavarpu argues that the BIA erred in concluding that his claimed status as one of the \u201cpeople targeted by the Naxalites\u201d did not constitute a \u201cparticular social group\u201d under the Act. The Naxalites, or People\u2019s War Group, is an extremist political faction in India. The BIA has defined \u201cparticular social group\u201d as a group whose members share \u201ccommon characteristics that members of the group either cannot change, or should not be required to change because such characteristics are fundamental to their individual identities.\u201d <em>In re Kasinga, </em>21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 357, 366 (BIA 1996). The BIA has provided the following factors to consider when determining whether a \u201cparticular social group\u201d exists: (1) \u201cwhether the group\u2019s shared characteristic gives the members the requisite social visibility to make them readily identifiable in society\u201d and (2) \u201cwhether the group can be defined with sufficient particularity to delimit its membership.\u201d <em>In re A-M-E &amp; J-G-U-, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 69, 69 (BIA 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">\u201c \u2018[A] social group cannot be defined exclusively by the fact that its members have been subjected to harm.\u2019 \u201d <em>Faye v. Holder, </em>580 F.3d 37, 41 (1st Cir.2009) (quoting <em>A-M-E &amp; J-G-U, </em>24 I. &amp; N. Dec at 74). Because \u201cpeople targeted by the Naxal-ites\u201d is defined wholly by its members having been harmed, it is not a particular social group under the BIA\u2019s interpretation of that term. Bayavarpu has not demonstrated that the BIA\u2019s interpretation of \u201cparticular social group\u201d is unreasonable. Therefore, the conclusion that \u201cpeople [like himself] targeted by the Nax-alites\u201d does not constitute such a group is entitled to deference under <em>Chevron.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b380-11\">Bayavarpu also argues that the BIA erred when it failed to address or grant relief based on his assertion that a clear probability of persecution exists on account of his political opinion, <em>i.e., </em>his neutrality. Bayavarpu cites no cases in which this court has adopted the hazardous neu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>trality doctrine, and we do not need to consider that doctrine today. Bayavarpu\u2019s case is similar to that of the alien in <em>INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992), who sought to avoid joining a guerilla group in his country. Like the record in <em>Elias-Zacarias, </em>the record in the instant case is devoid of evidence either of a political motive on Bayavarpu\u2019s part, even considering that he previously served as president of the student union at his college, or of a belief by the Naxalites that Bayavarpu held any specific political opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">The legal conclusions of the BIA are reasonable and entitled to deference, and the factual conclusions of the BIA are supported by the record and are also reasonable. Accordingly, Bayavarpu\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b379-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
