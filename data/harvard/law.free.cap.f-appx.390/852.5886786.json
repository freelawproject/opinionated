Michtavi argues that he was entitled to a new trial based on newly-discovered evidence, Fed.R.Crim.P. 33(b)(1), the district judge should have recused from his post-trial proceedings, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 144, 455, and his passport should have been retained by the clerk of the district court. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-17\">Michtavi argues that he is entitled to a new trial because the government violated his constitutional right to due process, <em>see Giglio v. United States, </em>405 U.S. 150, 92 S.Ct. 763, 31 L.Ed.2d 104 (1972), and <em>Brady v. United States, </em>397 U.S. 742, 90 S.Ct. 1463, 25 L.Ed.2d 747 (1970), and his rights under the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3500, by failing to disclose evidence that allegedly supported his defense and conflicted with the trial testimonies of coconspirator Mordechai Cohen and a fellow inmate, Hod Shlit, but we disagree. Michtavi argues about discovering new translations of three interviews between Cohen and the Israeli National Police, but Michtavi had tape recordings of Cohen\u2019s interviews that Michtavi could have used at trial to expose any inconsistent statements. <em>See United States v. Brown, </em>628 F.2d 471, 473 (5th Cir.1980) (\u201cIn no way can. information known and available to the defendant be said to have been suppressed by the Government.\u201d). The government could not have produced either the translations or statements that inmate Shlit made at his later Rule 35 hearing because they did not exist at the time of Michtavi\u2019s trial. <em>See United States v. Vallejo, </em>297 F.3d 1154, 1164 (11th Cir.2002). In any event, any inconsistencies between Cohen\u2019s and Shlit\u2019s testimonies and the new transcripts and Shlit\u2019s statements were minor, did not establish either witness had perjured himself, and \u201cwould have provided, at most, cumulative impeachment of [the witnesses\u2019] testimony.\u201d <em>Routly v. Singletary, </em>33 F.3d 1279, 1286 (11th Cir.1994). Despite Michtavi\u2019s argument to the contrary, Shlit\u2019s statements did not suggest that he was a government agent when he befriended Michtavi in prison. <em>See United States v. Calderon, </em>127 F.3d 1314, 1354-55 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b880-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"854\">*854</page-number>Michtavi also argues about statements that another coconspirator, Baruch Dadush, made to Israeli authorities in June and November of 2004, but Dadush\u2019s statements were inadmissible hearsay. Even if Dadush\u2019s statements had been admissible, they were consistent with Cohen\u2019s testimony, <em>see Crowe v. Hall, </em>490 F.3d 840, 846 (11th Cir.2007), and implicated Michtavi in the drug conspiracy. The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Michtavi\u2019s motion for a new trial without an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">Michtavi next argues that the district judge was biased and should have recused from his post-trial proceedings, but again we disagree. Recusal is required \u201conly if \u2018an objective, disinterested, lay observer fully informed of the facts underlying the grounds on which recusal was sought would entertain a significant doubt about the judge\u2019s impartiality.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 828 (11th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>United States v. Patti, </em>337 F.3d 1317, 1321 (11th Cir.2003)). Michtavi complains about adverse rulings and delays in ruling on his numerous post-trial motions, but \u201c[njeither the district judge\u2019s delay, nor [her] adverse rulings, constitute the sort of \u2018pervasive bias\u2019 that necessitates recusal.\u201d <em>Loranger v. Stierheim, </em>10 F.3d 776, 781 (11th Cir.1994). Michtavi also complains about his sentence, but we ruled on direct appeal that Michtavi\u2019s sentence is reasonable, <em>United States v. Michtavi, </em>225 Fed.Appx. 857, 858-59 (11th Cir.2007). The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Michtavi\u2019s motion to recuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">Finally, Michtavi argues that the clerk violated a local rule by failing to retain his passport, but this argument is frivolous. Although the clerk is required to store \u201c[a]ll exhibits received or offered in evidence\u201d unless the district court directs otherwise, S.D. Fla. R. 5.3(b), the exhibits must be \u201cremoved by the filing party within three months after final adjudication of the action or proceeding and disposition of any appeal\u201d or the \u201cexhibits may be destroyed or otherwise disposed of as the Clerk ... deem[s] proper,\u201d S.D. Fla. R. 5.3(c). Even if we assume the clerk failed to comply with the rule, Mi-chtavi was not prejudiced by the violation. Michtavi\u2019s passport was not destroyed and he submitted copies of his passport with his post-conviction pleadings. The district court did not abuse its discretion by denying Michtavi\u2019s motion to return his passport to the clerk.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-7\">We AFFIRM the denial of Michtavi\u2019s post-trial motions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
