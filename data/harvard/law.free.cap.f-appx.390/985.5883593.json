Harris argues that his sentence was erroneously enhanced based on a prior conviction for a drug offense, his right to due process was violated because his indictment was defective and the evidence against him was insufficient, and his order of forfeiture should be vacated. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"986\">*986</page-number>The district court did not err by dismissing Harris\u2019s motion. A convict may be resentenced when a conviction for a \u201cserious drug offense that was a basis for sentencing\u201d is declared \u201cunconstitutional or is vitiated on the explicit basis of innocence,\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3559(c)(7), but Harris presented no evidence to the district court, nor does he even argue to this Court, that a prior conviction has been overturned. Even if we construe Harris\u2019s motion liberally, we find no basis for relief. The district court considered Harris\u2019s arguments and found that none of his issues were \u201ccognizable under a different remedial statutory framework.\u201d <em>United States v. Jordan, </em>915 F.2d 622, 624-25 (11th Cir.1990). Harris\u2019s arguments are successive to those raised in previous collateral proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b1012-5\">We AFFIRM the dismissal of Harris\u2019s motion.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
