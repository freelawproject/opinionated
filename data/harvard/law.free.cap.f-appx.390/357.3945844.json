(\u201cAmerican\u201d) and DAL Global Services, L.L.C. (\u201cDAL\u201d). The district court found that Louisiana\u2019s one-year prescriptive period applied to Tigert\u2019s case rather than California\u2019s two-year prescriptive period, and that Tigert\u2019s claims were thus time-barred because she filed her complaint more than a year after her injury. The district court also denied Tigert\u2019s request to transfer her case to a district court in California under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">On appeal, Tigert argues that the district court (1) failed to take into account Louisiana\u2019s practice of \u201cstrictly construing\u201d prescriptive statutes in favor of allowing, rather than denying, a suit to proceed; (2) abused its discretion by denying her request for a transfer; and (3) abused its discretion by entering its dismissal with prejudice rather than without. Because (1) the district court correctly applied Louisiana\u2019s choice of law provision to prescriptive periods, (2) a transfer would not affect the timeliness of her claim, and (3) the <em>res judicata </em>effect of the district court\u2019s dismissal does not turn on whether it was with or without prejudice, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-13\">I. FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b384-14\">On July 11, 2007, Tigert arrived at the Oakland, California airport for a return flight with American Airlines to Shreveport, Louisiana, after visiting her son. Due to her disability, American provided Tigert with a wheelchair upon her arrival. An individual named \u201cBonita\u201d pushed Ti-gert\u2019s wheelchair to the airport\u2019s security checkpoint.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-15\">At the checkpoint, security officials conducted a further examination of Tigert\u2019s \u201cC-Pap Machine.\u201d Security personnel took the C-Pap Machine to a nearby table, and Bonita instructed Tigert to walk toward it. As she did, Bonita gathered Ti-gert\u2019s carry-on bag and placed it on the floor behind Tigert.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-16\">After security personnel informed Tigert that she could return to her seat, Tigert turned and tripped over her carry-on bag, injuring her right knee. Tigert boarded the plane to Shreveport, and upon arrival, her knee injury had manifested to a degree requiring medical attention. In August 2007, Tigert received injections to help alleviate the injury, and later that month, underwent arthroscopic surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-17\">On June 11, 2009, Tigert filed a negligence suit in the district court for the Western District of Louisiana against American and DAL for their collective failure \u201cto protect her by properly controlling, guarding, watching, and protecting her safety during the transportation of her through airport facilities.\u201d American and DAL filed a motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), argu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>ing that Louisiana\u2019s one-year prescriptive period for delictual actions time-barred her suit. The district court agreed, and dismissed Tigert\u2019s suit with prejudice, despite her request for a transfer to an appropriate district court in California. Tigert timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s dismissal of Tigert\u2019s action as time-barred under Rule 12(b)(6). <em>Brown v. Slenker, </em>220 F.3d 411, 419 (5th Cir.2000) (citing <em>Radford v. Gen. Dynamics Corp., </em>151 F.3d 396, 398 (5th Cir.1998)). We accept as true all well-pleaded facts and view them in the light most favorable to Tigert. <em>In re Katrina Canal Breaches Litig., </em>495 F.3d 191, 205 (5th Cir.2007) (citation omitted). \u201cTo survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss, [Tigert] must plead \u2018enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, </em>550 U.S. 544, 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">We review the district court\u2019s decision whether to transfer a case pursuant to \u00a7 1404(a) for abuse of discretion. <em>Save Power Ltd. v. Syntek Finance Corp., </em>121 F.3d 947, 950 n. 3 (5th Cir.1997). Likewise, we review \u201cthe district court\u2019s decision to grant a motion to dismiss with or without prejudice only for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Club Retro, LLC v. Hilton, </em>568 F.3d 181, 215 n. 34 (5th Cir.2009) (citing <em>Schiller v. Physicians Res. Group Inc., </em>342 F.3d 563, 567 (5th Cir.2003)).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">On appeal, Tigert advances three arguments. First, she contends that the district court should have applied California\u2019s two-year prescriptive period rather than Louisiana\u2019s one-year prescriptive period. Next, she argues that, in lieu of dismissing her suit with prejudice, the district court should have transferred her case to an appropriate federal court in California. Finally, Tigert asserts that the district court should have dismissed her suit without prejudice, which would have allowed her to pursue her action in California and escape Louisiana\u2019s time bar. We address each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-11\">A. Louisiana\u2019s One-Year Prescriptive Period</p>\n<p id=\"b385-12\">Tigert contends that the district court misapplied Louisiana\u2019s conflict of law and prescription principles when it held that her suit was time-barred. Specifically, Tigert argues that Louisiana has a policy of \u201cstrictly interpreting\u201d prescriptive periods in favor of maintaining, rather than dismissing, an action where two permissible views involving prescription are available. Tigert also argues that even if Louisiana\u2019s choice of law provision mandates that Louisiana\u2019s prescriptive period applies, she has demonstrated that \u201ccompelling considerations of remedial justice\u201d favor applying California\u2019s prescriptive period. La. Civ.Code Ann. art. 3549(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b385-13\">Louisiana law states that \u201cdelictual actions are subject to a liberative prescription of one year,\u201d which \u201ccommences to run from the day injury or damages is sustained.\u201d <em>Id. </em>art. 3492. California law, on the other hand, provides a two year statute of limitations for any \u201caction for assault, battery, or injury to, or for the death of, an individual caused by the wrongful act or neglect of another.\u201d Cal. Civ. Proc. \u00a7 335.1. Because Tigert filed this diversity suit in Louisiana, we are bound to follow Louisiana\u2019s choice of law rules. <em>See Marchesani v. Pellerin-Milnor Corp., </em>269 F.3d 481, 486 (5th Cir.2001) (citation omitted). Louisiana\u2019s choice of law provision provides that \u201c[w]hen the substantive law of another state would be applicable to the merits of an action <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>brought in this state, the prescription and peremption law of this state applies.\u201d La. Civ.Code Ann. art. 3549(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">Article 3549(B), however, incorporates a relevant exception: if Louisiana law prescribes a cause of action, but the law of the state whose law applies to the substantive conduct would find the action timely, the suit may be maintained as timely in a Louisiana court if maintenance in Louisiana is \u201cwarranted by compelling considerations of remedial justice.\u201d \u201cThere is no question that the authors of the \u2018compelling considerations of remedial justice\u2019 exception intended it to be used in only the most extraordinary of circumstances.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>220 F.3d at 420 (citation omitted). Comment f to article 3549 describes examples of \u201ccompelling considerations\u201d as those</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b386-5\">where through no fault of the plaintiff an alternative forum is not available as, for example, where jurisdiction could not be obtained over the defendant in any state other than the forum or where for some reason a judgment obtained in the other state having jurisdiction would be unenforceable in other states, [and] ... also situations where suit in this alternative forum, although not impossible would be extremely inconvenient for the parties.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">(citation and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cIn cases where plaintiffs have litigated their claims in Louisiana by choice, not by necessity, claims of \u2018compelling considerations\u2019 warranting maintenance of the suit in Louisiana have been consistently rejected.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>220 F.3d at 420; <em>see id. </em>(noting that \u201c[o]nly one case has found compelling considerations of remedial justice,\u201d and in that case, \u201cLouisiana was the only forum in which suit could be maintained, because it was the only forum in which jurisdiction could be obtained over all the defendants\u201d) (citing <em>Smith v. Odeco (UK) Inc., </em>615 So.2d 407, 409 (La.Ct.App.1993)).</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">Here, Tigert has not demonstrated \u201ccompelling considerations of remedial justice\u201d that would be served by maintenance of her action in Louisiana. <em>See </em>La. Civ. Code Ann. art. 3549. California provides the locus of the alleged injury causing conduct and the place of the injury, and Tigert has not alleged that her decision to litigate her negligence claim in Louisiana was based on necessity rather than choice. <em>See Brown, </em>220 F.3d at 420. Simply put, Tigert has not alleged any inconvenience that rises to the extraordinary level necessary to trigger article 3549\u2019s \u201ccompelling considerations of remedial justice\u201d exception to its prescriptive period choice of law provision.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-10\">Tigert\u2019s argument that Louisiana strictly construes prescriptive statutes in favor of maintaining, rather than dismissing, an action, lacks merit. The district court did not interpret Louisiana\u2019s prescriptive statute, La. Civ.Code Ann. art 3492; rather, it interpreted Louisiana\u2019s choice of law provision, which mandates that Louisiana\u2019s prescriptive period applies to all cases filed in Louisiana courts, irrespective of the underlying substantive law. <em>See id. </em>art. 3549. The cases Tigert cites for her argument do not consider whether Louisiana coui'ts should apply another state\u2019s prescriptive period; instead, they address instances in which a person cannot bring a suit for a period of time;<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a plaintiffs complaint identifies two causes of action, each susceptible to a different prescriptive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>period;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> or a question arises as to interruption or suspension of a prescriptive period.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Finally, Tigert\u2019s contention that her inconvenience, when coupled with Louisiana\u2019s strict construction principles, rises to the level of a compelling consideration of remedial justice, entirely lacks support in Louisiana caselaw.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">The district court correctly determined that Louisiana\u2019s one-year prescriptive period applied to Tigert\u2019s suit. Because Ti-gert\u2019s injury accrued on July 11, 2007, her filing on June 11, 2009 was time-barred. We thus hold that the district court correctly dismissed Tigert\u2019s suit as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">B. Transfer under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a)</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">In the alternative, Tigert argues that the district court should have transferred her case to a district court in California. In support, she cites <em>Seagrave v. Delta Airlines, Inc., </em>in which a district court, after finding that Louisiana\u2019s prescriptive period barred the plaintiffs claim in Louisiana, transferred the case to a federal court in Virginia, which had a prescriptive period that had not yet expired. 848 F.Supp. 82, 85-86 (E.D.La.1994). The <em>Seagrave </em>court found that a dismissal was not \u201cin the interests of justice, as it might create prescription problems for the plaintiff in Virginia, and it is plain that the suit could have been filed in Virginia.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 86. Although the <em>Seagrave </em>court \u201crecognize[d] that Louisiana Civil Code article 3549 contemplates the dismissal of the action,\u201d it concluded that \u201ca transfer comports with both the directive of article 3549 and the interests of justice,\u201d especially considering \u201cLouisiana\u2019s strong policy of providing remedies to tortiously injured plaintiffs and deterring wrongful conduct (codified in [La. Civ.Code Ann.] art. 3542) and the practical solution offered by 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a).\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b387-11\">Although factually analogous to Tigert\u2019s case, here, the district court correctly noted'that the <em>Seagrave </em>court failed to consider the effect of the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Ferens v. John Deere Co., </em>494 U.S. 516, 523, 110 S.Ct. 1274, 108 L.Ed.2d 443 (1990), and <em>Piper Aircraft Co. v. Reyno, </em>454 U.S. 235, 244 n. 8, 102 S.Ct. 252, 70 L.Ed.2d 419 (1981). <em>Ferens </em>held that a transferee forum must \u201capply the law of the transferor court, regardless of who' initiates the transfer. A transfer under \u00a7 1404(a), in other words, does not change the law applicable' to a diversity case.\u201d 494 U.S. at 523, 110 S.Ct. 1274. Likewise, in <em>Piper Aircraft, </em>the Supreme Court stated that although \u201ca court ordinarily must apply the choice-of-law rules of the State in which it sits[,] ... where a case is transferred pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1404(a), it must apply the choice-of-law rules of the State from which the case was transferred.\u201d 454 U.S. at 244 n. 8, 102 S.Ct. 252 (citing <em>Van Dusen v. Barrack, </em>376 U.S. 612, 84 S.Ct. 805, 11 L.Ed.2d 945 (1964)).</p>\n<p id=\"b387-12\">In other words, were the district court to have transferred Tigert\u2019s cause of action to a district court in California, under <em>Piper Aircraft </em>and <em>Ferens, </em>a California district court would be bound to apply Louisiana\u2019s article 3549, find that Louisiana\u2019s one year prescriptive period applies, and con-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>elude that Tigert failed to demonstrate any compelling considerations of remedial justice warranting application of California\u2019s longer prescriptive period. Because Louisiana\u2019s one-year prescriptive period would follow Tigert to California, we agree with the district court that transferring would do little more than inconvenience the parties. We thus decline to adopt the approach used in <em>Seagrave, </em>a non-prece-dential district court decision, and instead affirm the district court\u2019s decision not to transfer Tigert\u2019s case to a district court in California.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">C. Dismissal With Prejudice</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">Finally, Tigert argues that the district court abused its discretion by entering a dismissal with prejudice rather than a dismissal without prejudice. She claims that the district court noted the possibility that she could re-file her negligence suit in California, but contends that it closed off her opportunity to do so by entering a dismissal with prejudice. She asserts that dismissals for failure to state a claim are final, and would thus be <em>res judicata </em>on another action.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">The Supreme Court, however, has explained that a dismissal with prejudice does not necessarily bar a plaintiff from filing again in another jurisdiction. <em>See Semtek Int\u2019l v. Lockheed Martin Corp. (\u201cSemtek\u201d), </em>531 U.S. 497, 506, 121 S.Ct. 1021, 149 L.Ed.2d 32 (2001) (\u201c[Ujnlike a dismissal \u2018without prejudice,\u2019 the dismissal in the present case barred refiling of the same claim in the United States District Court for the Central District of California. That is undoubtedly a necessary condition, but it is not a sufficient one, for claim-preclusive effect in other courts.\u201d). Traditionally, \u201cexpiration of the applicable statute of limitations merely bars the remedy and does not extinguish the substantive right, so that dismissal on that ground does not have claim-preclusive effect in other jurisdictions with longer, unexpired limitations periods.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 504, 121 S.Ct. 1021 (citing Restatement (Second) of Conflict of Laws \u00a7\u00a7 142(2), 143 (1969); Restatement of Judgments \u00a7 49, cmt. a (1942)). The <em>Semtek </em>Court concluded that \u201cfederal common law governs the claim-preclusive effect of a dismissal by a federal court sitting in diversity,\u201d and adopted, \u201cas the federally prescribed rule of decision, the law that would be applied by state courts in the State in which the federal diversity court sits.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 508, 121 S.Ct. 1021 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">In other words, the district court\u2019s designation of its dismissal as with or without prejudice is immaterial. What matters for purposes of Tigert\u2019s case is, whether given refiling in California, a California court would find that the district court\u2019s dismissal on grounds of Louisiana\u2019s prescriptive period bars refiling in California. <em>Cf. id. </em>at 509, 121 S.Ct. 1021 (\u201cBecause the claim-preclusive effect of the California federal court\u2019s dismissal \u2018upon the merits\u2019 of petitioner\u2019s action on statute-of-limitations grounds is governed by a federal rule that in turn incorporates California\u2019s law of claim preclusion ..., the Maryland Court of Special Appeals erred in holding that the dismissal necessarily precluded the bringing of this action in the Maryland courts.\u201d). Because that issue is not before us, we decline to address it. We do note, however, that a dismissal of Tigert\u2019s claim without prejudice would abrogate American and DAL\u2019s statute of limitations defense to the extent that Tigert wishes to re-file and prosecute her claim in Louisiana. <em>See id. </em>at 505, 121 S.Ct. 1021 (\u201cThe primary meaning of \u2018dismissal without prejudice,\u2019 we think, is dismissal without barring the plaintiff from returning later, to the same court, with the same underlying claim. That will also ordinarily (though not always) have the consequence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>of not barring the claim from other courts, but its primary meaning relates to the dismissing court itself.\u201d). For these reasons, we find that the district court did not abuse its discretion by dismissing Tigert\u2019s claim with prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">The district court correctly found that Louisiana\u2019s one year prescriptive period applied to Tigert\u2019s claim, and that because it did, Tigert\u2019s claim was time-barred. Additionally, the district court did not abuse its discretion when it denied Tigert\u2019s request to transfer her case to a district court in California. Finally, the district court did not abuse its discretion by dismissing Tigert\u2019s suit with prejudice. For all these reasons, we affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Tigert\u2019s negligence suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b384-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
