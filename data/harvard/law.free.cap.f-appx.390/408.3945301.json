In his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>motion, Wheelock- asserts that he is eligible for a sentence reduction based on Amendments 591, 706, and 715 to the Sentencing Guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">Wheelock was sentenced to a statutorily-mandated term of life imprisonment on his conviction for conspiracy to distribute more than 50 grams of crack cocaine because he committed that offense following two or more prior convictions for a felony drug offense. <em>See 21 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A). Because, pursuant to our decision in <em>United States v. Carter, </em>595 F.3d 575, 577-81 (5th Cir.2010), Wheelock was subject to a statutorily-mandated sentence that exceeded the guideline range, he was ineligible for a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), regardless of any retroactive amendments affecting that guideline range.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED; the government\u2019s motion for summary affirmance is GRANTED; and its alternative motion for an extension of time is DENIED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b434-8\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
