Reyes-Gutierrez argues that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court failed to adequately explain the basis for his sentence, and also failed to adequately consider the mitigating evidence and arguments that he presented during his sentencing hearing.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b893-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"867\">*867</page-number>In addition, Reyes-Gutierrez argues that his sentence, which is at the low end of his guideline range, is substantively unreasonable. In support of this argument, Reyes-Gutierrez points to his familial ties, and asserts the 36-month sentence that he suggested at sentencing would be severe. Reyes-Gutierrez also asserts that there were mitigating circumstances surrounding his past offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-5\">For the reasons set forth below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-7\">A federal grand jury indicted Reyes-Gutierrez, charging that he, an alien who had been convicted of a felony offense, had unlawfully entered the United States after having previously been removed from the United States, in violation of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(a) and (b)(1). Reyes-Gutierrez pled guilty to the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-8\">In preparing the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), the probation officer noted that immigration authorities had deported Reyes-Gutierrez in July 2008. Thereafter, Reyes-Gutierrez was arrested in Florida on November 12, 2008, for committing battery against his wife, Solidad Soriano. In an interview with a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer, Reyes-Gutierrez admitted that he had re-entered the United States approximately one month after his deportation in July. In reviewing Reyes-Gutierrez\u2019s criminal history, the probation officer reported that, in 1999, Reyes-Gutierrez had sustained a conviction for aggravated assault on a law enforcement officer. In addition to his aggravated-assault conviction, Reyes-Gutierrez had sustained two convictions for battery. The arrest reports reflected that these convictions arose out of incidents of domestic violence by Reyes-Gutierrez against Soriano. In connection with his more recent battery conviction, the arrest report had stated that Reyes-Gutierrez partially had choked Soriano with a bandana, and had threatened to kill her.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-10\">In reviewing Reyes-Gutierrez\u2019s personal history, the probation officer reported that Reyes-Gutierrez and Soriano had 4 children between the ages of 4 and 11, and that Reyes-Gutierrez provided the majority of the family\u2019s financial support. Sori-ano informed the U.S. Probation Office that Reyes-Gutierrez was a \u201cgood father and husband,\u201d and stated that she would like for Reyes-Gutierrez to return to their residence and live with their family. The PSI reported that Reyes-Gutierrez\u2019s total offense level was 21, which, when combined with his criminal history category of VI, produced a guideline range of 77 to 96 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b893-11\">At sentencing, the court adopted the factual statements and guideline applications in the PSI. Reyes-Gutierrez argued that, in light of the sentencing factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), the court should grant him a downward variance. In mitigation of his sentence, Reyes-Gutierrez presented the statements of his sister and his 11-year-old daughter. Reyes-Gutierrez\u2019s sister and daughter informed the court that Reyes-Gutierrez was the primary source of his family\u2019s financial support. In further mitigation of his sentence, Reyes-Gutierrez argued that his criminal history, as a whole, did not demonstrate that he was a violent person, and asserted that many of his offenses bore a connection to his problem with alcohol consumption. He pointed out that, although he twice had been convicted of battery against Soriano, Soriano had informed the U.S. Probation Officer that she hoped that Reyes-Gutierrez would be able to resume residing with their family. Reyes-Gutierrez emphasized that he had re-entered the United States in order to provide for his family. He suggested that a 36-month term of imprisonment would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"868\">*868</page-number>be sufficient to serve the statutory purposes of sentencing, as 3 years in prison constitutes a severe punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-4\">The court imposed a sentence of 77 months\u2019 imprisonment, stating, \u201c[T]he [c]ourt is required to impose a sentence that is sufficient, but not greater than necessary, after considering all the statutory factors. Your attorney has gone over those, and I\u2019ve considered all those factors.\u201d The court further stated that, although Reyes-Gutierrez\u2019s guideline range was advisory, a downward variance was not warranted under the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The court next stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-5\">You have an extensive criminal history for the last ten years. You\u2019ve been committing crimes. Some less serious than others, of course. But, as a result of that, you score the highest criminal history category that the [Guidelines have. You violated probation on several occasions. All of this is by a person who is not supposed to be in this country at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-6\">I\u2019d be more impressed with the pleas with regard to family membership if your last conviction hadn\u2019t been battery upon your wife. You\u2019ve used a number of aliases, a number of different dates of births. You have drug and alcohol issues. You\u2019ve committed crimes of violence, in my view, as exemplified by the two battery convictions and the aggravated assault on a law enforcement officer that\u2019s in your history.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-7\">You were deported from the United States relatively recently. You came back almost immediately. There\u2019s no doubt in my mind that you are going to do the same thing if given another opportunity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b894-9\">After imposing sentence, the court asked the parties if there were any objections to the sentence or the manner in which it was imposed. Reyes-Gutierrez objected that his sentence constituted an abuse of the court\u2019s discretion, and asserted that a downward variance was warranted. The court overruled the objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b894-11\">After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), the Guidelines are advisory in nature, and \u201ca sentence may be reviewed for procedural or substantive unreasonableness.\u201d <em>United States v. Hunt, </em>459 F.3d 1180, 1181-82 &amp; n. 3 (11th Cir.2006). The reasonableness of a sentence is reviewed under an abuse-of-discretion standard. <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1189-90 (11th Cir.2008) (citing <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b894-12\">A sentence is procedurally unreasonable if the district court failed to calculate or incorrectly calculated the guideline range, treated the Guidelines as mandatory, failed to consider the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), selected a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failed to explain adequately the chosen sentence. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. at 597. Section 3553(a) provides that district courts imposing a sentence must consider, <em>inter alia:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b894-13\">(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need for the sentence imposed \u2014 (A) to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b895-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"869\">*869</page-number>(B) to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct; (C) to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; and (D) to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner; [and] (3) the kinds of sentences available.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b895-5\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(l)-(3). The court also should consider the applicable guideline range, any pertinent policy statements promulgated by the Sentencing Commission, the need to avoid any unwarranted sentencing disparities, and the need to provide restitution to any victims of the offense. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(4)-(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-6\">A district court \u201cmust adequately explain the chosen sentence to allow for meaningful appellate review and to promote the perception of fair sentencing.\u201d <em>Gall, 552 </em>U.S. at 50, 128 S.Ct. at 597. Specifically, \u00a7 3553(c) requires that, \u201c[t]he sentencing judge ... set forth [sufficient reasoning] to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties\u2019 argu- \u2022 ments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decisionmaking authority.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 356, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-7\">Procedural reasonableness does not require that a court recite or discuss each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005) (addressing whether a defendant\u2019s sentence was procedurally reasonable under Booker); <em>see also United States v. Bonilla, </em>463 F.3d 1176, 1182 (11th Cir.2006) (addressing whether the court adequately articulated the basis for the defendant\u2019s sentence, as required by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(c)(1)). Rather, it is sufficient if a court merely states that, in selecting the defendant\u2019s sentence, it has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Scott, </em>426 F.3d at 1329-30. On the other hand, a district court need not expressly mention \u00a7 3553(a) where its reasoning demonstrates that it considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>See United States v. Dorman, </em>488 F.3d 936, 944 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b895-9\">Here, the district court did not abuse its discretion by failing to adequately explain the basis for its sentence. The court expressly stated that it had consid-. ered \u201call\u201d of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors in determining Reyes-Gutierrez\u2019s sentence, and noted that Reyes-Gutierrez had presented arguments as to the application of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. Moreover, by discussing the extent and nature of Reyes-Gutierrez\u2019s criminal history, as well as the fact that Reyes-Gutierrez had re-entered the United States one month after he was deported, the court demonstrated its consideration of several of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors \u2014 namely, the nature and circumstances of the offense, the history and characteristics of the defendant, and the need for the sentence to provide for adequate deterrence and to protect the public from future crimes. In its reasoning, the court made clear that, although Reyes-Gutierrez had familial obligations, a guideline sentence was warranted due to his past crimes and demonstrated disregard for the law. Accordingly, the court\u2019s reasoning was sufficient to provide for meaningful appellate review.</p>\n<p id=\"b895-10\">Moreover, while Reyes-Gutierrez asserts that the court failed to adequately consider his mitigating arguments and evidence, the court expressly discussed Reyes-Gutierrez\u2019s emphasis on his relationship with his family, and concluded that this argument was undermined by Reyes-Gutierrez\u2019s two convictions for committing battery against his wife. In addition, although the court did not separately address Reyes-Gutierrez\u2019s request for a 36-month sentence, the court made clear that it rejected this proposed sentence due to the extent and nature of Reyes-Gutier<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"870\">*870</page-number>rez\u2019s criminal history. Accordingly, Reyes-Gutierrez\u2019s argument in this regard lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-4\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-5\">\u201c[A] sentence may be substantively unreasonable, regardless of the procedure used.\u201d <em>Hunt, </em>459 F.3d at 1182 n. 3. The party challenging the sentence \u201cbears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of [the] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). \u201c[T]here is a range of reasonable sentences from which the district court may choose,\u201d and, when the court imposes a sentence that is within the guideline range, we ordinarily expect that sentence to be reasonable. <em>Id. </em>A district court possesses \u201cconsiderable discretion\u201d in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and we defer to the district court\u2019s judgment unless it made \u201ca clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1191 (quotation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b896-6\">Reyes-Gutierrez has failed to meet his burden of establishing that his 77-month sentence is substantively unreasonable. This sentence was within Reyes-Gutierrez\u2019s guideline range, and well below the applicable statutory-maximum term of ten years\u2019 imprisonment. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1326(b)(1). While Reyes-Gutierrez emphasizes his familial ties and the length of his proposed 36-month sentence, and asserts that there were mitigating circumstances surrounding his criminal history, these arguments do not demonstrate that his sentence is substantively unreasonable. As the district court correctly noted, Reyes-Gutierrez\u2019s argument that his familial ties warranted a downward variance was undermined by the fact that he had sustained two convictions for battery against his wife. In this regard, it bears noting that the facts underlying Reyes-Gutierrez\u2019s second battery conviction indicated that this battery was particularly violent, as the offense involved choking and a death threat. In addition, this battery conviction occurred recently, in November 2008, only several months after Reyes-Gutierrez was deported from the United States in July 2008. Moreover, Reyes-Gutierrez\u2019s re-entry into the United States only one month after he was deported demonstrated his disregard for the immigration laws. In light of these facts, the district court did not commit a clear error of judgment in concluding that a sentence at the low end of Reyes-Gutierrez\u2019s guideline range was warranted. Accordingly, Reyes-Gutierrez\u2019s has failed to demonstrate that his 77-month sentence is outside the range of reasonable sentences. As a result, the district court did not abuse its discretion by imposing a 77-month sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b896-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b892-14\">. Reyes-Gutierrez also argues, in his reply brief, that the district court procedurally erred by treating his guideline range as presumptively reasonable. We do not address this argument, as Reyes-Gutierrez failed to raise it in his initial brief. See <em>United States v. Britt, </em>437 F.3d 1103, 1104-05 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b894-8\">. The government argues that Reyes-Gutierrez\u2019s procedural-reasonableness arguments are subject to plain-error review because he did not raise these arguments before the district court. We do not decide whether plain-error review would apply in this case because, as explained below, Reyes-Gutierrez\u2019s sentence is procedurally reasonable under either an abuse-of-discretion or plain-error standard of review.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
