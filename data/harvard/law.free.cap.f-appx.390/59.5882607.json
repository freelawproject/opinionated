United States, </em>516 U.S. 137, 116 S.Ct. 501, 133 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995), and, therefore, he is actually innocent of the \u00a7 924(c) offense.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The District Court ordered respondent to file an answer to the petition. Respondent argued that the petition should be dismissed because Davis cannot show that his remedy under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 is inadequate or ineffective, and thus he cannot pursue relief under \u00a7 2241. The Magistrate Judge agreed, concluding that Davis had ample opportunity to raise his <em>Bailey </em>claim previously, as he could have raised the claim in a \u00a7 2255 motion that he filed in the sentencing court in 1997. The District Court adopted that analysis and dismissed the \u00a7 2241 petition. Davis timely filed this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-11\">We have appellate jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Our review is plenary. <em>See Ruggiano v. Reish, </em>307 F.3d 121, 126 (3d Cir.2002). After a careful review of the record, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment because this appeal resents no substantial question. See 3d Cm. LAR 27.4 and IOP Ch. 10.6.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-12\">As the Magistrate Judge fully and accurately .explained, Davis could have asserted his challenge to the \u00a7 924(c) conviction when he filed his \u00a7 2255 motion in the sentencing court in March 1997, which was fifteen months after the <em>Bailey </em>decision was issued. Section 2255 provides the presumptive means through which a federal prisoner must raise a challenge to a conviction. <em>Okereke v. United States, </em>307 F.3d 117, 120 (3d Cir.2002). Although a prisoner may use \u00a7 2241 if \u00a7 2255 is shown to be \u201cinadequate or ineffective,\u201d Davis has not made this showing. Davis makes no claim that he was unable to raise the legal and factual substance of his <em>Bailey </em>argument in the \u00a7 2255 proceeding, and he was not prevented by AEDPA\u2019s strict gatekeeping requirements from pursuing the claim at that time. Davis, therefore, is not in the \u201cunusual position\u201d of having \u201chad no earlier opportunity to challenge his conviction\u201d in light of <em>Bailey. In re Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d 245, 251 (3d Cir.1997). As such, his \u00a7 2241 petition was properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-13\">We will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b86-9\">. Davis was housed at a federal prison within the Middle District of Pennsylvania at the time he commenced this proceeding. He was later transferred to a federal prison in Kentucky.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b86-15\">. Davis was also convicted of bank robbery under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) and (d). The trial court imposed a sentence of 262 months in prison on the bank robbery conviction plus a consecutive term of sixty months for the \u00a7 924(c)(1) conviction.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
