He also petitions this court for review of the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion for reconsideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b346-21\">Lazaro argues on appeal that his prior offenses-i.e., an assault family violence offense under Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 22.01 (Vernon 2003) and a theft offense under Tex. Penal Code Ann. \u00a7 31.03 (Vernon 2003)-are not crimes of moral turpitude. He does not dispute the BIA\u2019s conclusion that he is ineligible for cancellation of removal, and he therefore has abandoned any challenge on that ground. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b346-22\">We apply a two-part standard of review to the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Lazaro committed a crime involving moral turpitude. <em>Amouzadeh v. Winfrey, </em>467 F.3d 451, 455 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>(5th Cir.2006). First, we accord substantial deference to the BIA\u2019s interpretation of the Immigration and Nationality Act and its definition of the phrase \u201cmoral turpitude.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Second, we review de novo whether the elements of a state or federal crime fit the BIA\u2019s definition of a crime involving moral turpitude. <em>Id </em>The BIA\u2019s determination of what constitutes moral turpitude must be upheld if that determination is reasonable. <em>Hamdan v. INS, </em>98 F.3d 183, 185 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-5\">Section 22.01, which criminalizes assault, encompasses acts that both are and are not crimes of moral turpitude; we therefore must review the record of conviction to determine whether Lazaro\u2019s offense falls into a subsection that is a crime of moral turpitude. <em>See Amouzadeh v. Winfrey, </em>467 F.3d 451, 455 (5th Cir.2006). The record reveals that Lazaro was convicted under the provision of \u00a7 22.01 that provides enhanced punishment to a defendant convicted of multiple -assaults against per-\u2019 sons with whom he has a special relationship. <em>See </em>\u00a7 22.01(b)(2)(A). In this case, the conditions of supervision portion of the judgment, which requires Lazaro to participate in domestic violence treatment programs, confirms that the victim of the offense was his wife. Moreover, the charging instrument, which states that Lazaro caused bodily injury to his wife by striking, pulling, and grabbing her, reveals that Lazaro was convicted of an intentional and injurious crime. Thus, because the record shows that Lazaro was convicted of intentionally inflicting bodily injury upon his wife, the BIA\u2019s conclusion that his assault offense was a crime involving moral turpitude was reasonable. <em>See In re Tran, </em>21 I &amp; N Dec. 291, 294 (BIA 1996) (holding that statute requiring the willful infliction of corporal injury resulting in a traumatic condition upon, inter alia, the perpetrator\u2019s spouse was crime involving moral turpitude); <em>see also In re Sanudo, </em>23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 968, 970-71 (indicating that moral turpitude necessarily inheres in assault and battery offenses that involve the infliction of bodily harm upon a person whom society views as deserving of special protection, such as a domestic partner).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-7\">Under \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)\u00ae, an alien is removable if he has been convicted of a crime of moral turpitude within five years after the date of admission, and a sentence of one year or longer may be imposed for the offense. Lazaro does not dispute that his assault offense was punishable by a term of more than one year of imprisonment or was committed within five years of his admission. Thus, any challenge to either the sentence that could be imposed for his offense or the date used to determine his date of admission are abandoned. <em>See Soad/jede, </em>324 F.3d at 833. Lazaro has not demonstrated that the BIA wrongly found that he was removable under \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)\u00ae, and his petition for review of the BIA\u2019s dismissal of his appeal should be denied. Because Lazaro is removable under \u00a7 1227(a)(2)(A)\u00ae, we need not review whether the BIA also correctly found that he was removable under \u00a7 1227(a) (2) (A) (ii).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-10\">Lazaro timely filed a separate petition for review from the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion for reconsideration. However, his brief to this court addresses only the BIA\u2019s decision dismissing his appeal; he raises no issues with respect to the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion for reconsideration. Accordingly, any challenge to the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion for reconsideration has been waived. <em>See Soadjede, </em>324 F.3d at 833.</p>\n<p id=\"b347-11\">For the foregoing reasons, Lazaro\u2019s petitions for review are DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b346-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
