He contends the district court erred by imposing: a crime-of-violence enhancement based on his prior Texas conviction for burglary of a habitation; and a criminal history point for his violating Texas law by falsely identifying himself when he was arrested. He maintains these errors render his sentence substantively unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b330-16\">Although <em>post-Booker, </em>the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory only, and an ultimate sentence is reviewed for reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, the district court must still properly calculate the guideline-sentencing range for use in deciding on the sentence to impose. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 50-51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In that respect, its application of the guidelines is reviewed <em>de novo; </em>its factual findings, only for clear error. <em>E.g., United States v. Cisneros-Gutierrez, </em>517 F.3d 751, 764 (5th Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 359 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-17\">To determine the propriety of a crime-of-violence enhancement \u201cwhen a defendant\u2019s prior conviction is under a statute that identifies several separate offenses, some violent and others not, we ... look to certain other documents ... to detei'mine \u2018which statutory phrase was the basis for conviction\u2019\u201d. <em>United States v. Hughes, </em>602 F.3d 669, 674 (5th Cir.2010) (citing <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 1265, 1273, 176 L.Ed.2d 1 (2010)), <em>petition for cert. filed </em>(U.S. 6 Jul. 2010) (No. 10-5289). The indictment for Garcia\u2019s prior Texas conviction charged him with violating both subsections (a)(1) and (a)(3) of Texas Penal Code \u00a7 30.02 (Burglary), but the judgment does not show whether he pleaded guilty to violat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>ing subsection (a)(1), subsection (a)(3), or both (they are <em>not </em>mutually exclusive provisions). To that end, Garcia, his attorney, and the prosecutor all signed written plea admonishments stating: \u201cIt is mutually agreed and recommended by the parties\u201d that \u201c[p]rosecution [is] to proceed on <em>all allegations </em>in the indictment\u201d. (Emphasis added.) Therefore, Garcia admitted to violating both subsections, and the district court did <em>not </em>err in applying the crime-of-violence enhancement. <em>See United States v. Garcia-Mendez, </em>420 F.3d 454, 456-57 (5th Cir.2005) (holding violation of Tex. Penal Code \u00a7 30.02(a)(1) constitutes crime of violence).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-5\">Garcia also maintains his conviction pursuant to Texas law for falsely identifying himself on the same day that he was found unlawfully present in the United States should not have been assigned a criminal history point pursuant to Guideline \u00a7 4A1.2(a)(l). Specifically, he contends that, because he falsely identified himself in order to avoid detection as unlawfully present in the United States, his false-identification offense was \u201cpart of the instant [reentry] offense\u201d and, therefore, should not result in his being assessed a criminal history point. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7\u00a7 1B1.3; 4A1.2, cmt. n. 1 (defining \u201cprior sentence\u201d). But, because it is \u201cplausible in light of the record read as a whole\u201d that Garcia falsely identified himself in order to prevent being charged with several <em>other </em>crimes he had committed during the two weeks before his arrest, the district court did <em>not </em>clearly err in assessing'the criminal-history point. <em>See United States v. Cooper, </em>274 F.3d 230, 238 (5th Cir.2001) (citing <em>United States v. Puig-Infante, </em>19 F.3d 929, 943 (5th Cir.1994)).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-6\">Garcia\u2019s substantive-reasonableness challenge rests on his contentions that his guidelines range was improperly calculated. He has <em>not </em>shown the district court erred in calculating that range; and, therefore, he has <em>not </em>overcome the presumption that his within-guidelines sentence was reasonable. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b331-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b330-12\"> Pursuant to <em>5m </em>Cm.
