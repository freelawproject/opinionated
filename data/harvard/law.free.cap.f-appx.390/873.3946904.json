Green, through his attorney Richard A. Culbertson, appeals the district court\u2019s order partially granting Culbertson\u2019s request for attorneys\u2019 fees under the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406(b). Although the magistrate judge awarded Culbertson attorneys\u2019 fees under \u00a7 406(b), he declined appellant\u2019s request to reduce his \u00a7 406(b) fee with a smaller fee previously awarded under the Equal Access to Justice Act (\u201cEAJA\u201d), concluding that strict compliance with the EAJA Savings Provision instead required Culbertson to refund the smaller EAJA fee and accept the \u00a7 406(b) fee in full. Green challenges that ruling in this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b900-7\">In the intervening months after Green filed this appeal, our Court decided <em>Jackson v. Commissioner of Social Security, </em>601 F.3d 1268 (11th Cir.2010), which squarely controls this case. In <em>Jackson, </em>we held that the EAJA Savings Provision does not mandate a specific procedure for refunding the smaller of the two attorneys\u2019 fees when a prevailing claimant recovers fees under both the EAJA and 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406(b). 601 F.3d at 1272. Thus, we reversed the district court, which had held that the EAJA Savings Provision required it to award the full 25% of a claimant\u2019s past-due benefits in order to require the attorney to refund the EAJA fee. The district court made the same error here in denying Culbertson\u2019s request to deduct the EAJA fee from his \u00a7 406(b) fee and award him the difference. <em>Jackson </em>made plain that \u201cthe attorney may choose to effectuate the refund by deducting the amount of an earlier EAJA award from his subsequent 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 406(b) request.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1274. Accordingly, we reverse and remand for further proceedings consistent with <em>Jackson </em>and this opinion.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b900-11\">REVERSED AND REMANDED.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b900-8\">. We decline to address the Commissioner\u2019s argument that the district court erred in calculating Green's \u00a7 406(b) fee by failing to include in its calculus the $5,300.00 already paid to Green\u2019s administrative attorney under \u00a7 406(a) because the Commissioner failed to file a cross-appeal raising the issue. <em>See United States v. Am. Ry. Express Co., </em>265 U.S. 425, 435-36, 44 S.Ct. 560, 564, 68 L.Ed. 1087 (1924) (although a party may raise any argument in support of a- judgment, a party who has not appealed may not bring an argument in opposition to a judgment or attack the judgment in any respect); <em>Campbell v. Wainwright, </em>726 F.2d 702, 704 (11th Cir.1984) (a party who has not appealed may not \"hitch a ride on his adversary\u2019s notice of appeal\u201d to \"enlarge his rights under the judgment or diminish those of the opposing party\").</p>\n<p id=\"b900-9\">Nor do we address Green\u2019s argument that the \u00a7 406(b) fee awarded by the magistrate judge was unreasonable because it exceeded the amount agreed upon by the patties. This argument is based on a mischaracterization of the fee agreement, which provided that the \u00a7 406(b) fee would be 25% of the past-due benefits. Contrary to Green's suggestion, the \u00a7 406(b) fee set by the agreement would produce the same net dollars for the attorney as would the magistrate\u2019s order. Viewed in this light, Green's reasonableness argument is nothing more than a circular reprise of his disagreement with the magistrate judge\u2019s interpretation of the EAJA\u2019s Savings Clause and his refusal to apply the EAJA fee to the \u00a7 406(b) fee, which is resolved by <em>Jackson </em>in Green\u2019s favor.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b900-14\">.
