Hall appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 application, in which he challenged his conviction of tampering with a governmental document and the resulting sentence. Hall received a certificate of appealability to appeal whether the state trial court violated his constitutional rights when it denied his motion for a new trial and whether trial counsel performed ineffectively regarding Hall\u2019s motion for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"406\">*406</page-number>new trial. Hall argues, inter alia, that he was denied \u201cdue process\u201d and \u201cdue course of law\u201d when the trial judge denied his pro se motion for a new trial without securing Hall\u2019s presence at a hearing. Hall also argues that his trial counsel abandoned him during the time for filing his motion for a new trial, that counsel thus rendered ineffective assistance, and that counsel\u2019s abandonment forced him to proceed pro se.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">Hall presented the issues that are currently before this court to the Texas courts in his state habeas application. Hall\u2019s state habeas application was denied without written order, the record does not suggest that the State raised procedural grounds for denying relief, and the state court\u2019s decision does not suggest reliance upon procedural grounds as a basis for denying relief. This court will therefore apply the deferential standard of review set forth in the Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA). <em>See Singleton v. Johnson, </em>178 F.3d 381, 384 (5th Cir.1999). Under the AEDPA, Hall is not entitled to federal habeas relief unless the state court\u2019s adjudication of his claim \u201cresulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States\u201d or \u201cresulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d \u00a7 2254(d)(1), (d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">Hall\u2019s assertion that he was deprived of \u201cdue course of law\u201d appears to be premised on the Texas Constitution and Texas statutes, not the United States Constitution. <em>See </em>Tex. Const, art. 1, \u00a7\u00a7 13, 19 (providing, in Bill of Rights, for injured persons to have \u201cremedy by due course of law\u201d and that deprivation of \u201clife, liberty, property, privileges or immunities\u201d will not occur \u201cexcept by the due course of the law of the land\u201d). To the extent that Hall is arguing that the state court\u2019s failure to secure his presence at a hearing violated Texas state law, this court will not review a state court\u2019s interpretation of its own law in a federal habeas proceeding. <em>See Dickerson v. Guste, </em>932 F.2d 1142, 1145 (5th Cir.1991); <em>see also Malchi v. Thaler, </em>211 F.3d 953, 957 (5th Cir.2000) (observing that federal habeas relief is reserved for the deprivation of rights that are secured by the United States Constitutions or the laws of the United States). While Hall asserts that his due process rights were violated, he fails to provide a coherent argument explaining the parameters of the federal due process rights that attach to proceedings on a motion for a new trial in state prosecutions, nor does he discuss the due process rights that were purportedly violated in his case. Hall\u2019s conclusional allegations fail to establish that the Texas state court\u2019s denial of this claim resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2254(d)(1); <em>Williams v. Taylor, </em>529 U.S. 362, 405-06, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000) (explaining that the state court\u2019s decision must be substantially different from relevant Supreme Court precedent). Moreover, even if there was a due process violation, Hall has failed to establish actual prejudice resulting from the claimed error. <em>See Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 637-38, 113 S.Ct. 1710, 123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993); <em>Harris v. Warden, Louisiana State Penitentiary, </em>152 F.3d 430, 437 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">Finally, the Supreme Court has not clearly established that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel exists during proceedings on a motion for a new trial. <em>See Mayo v. Cockrell, </em>287 F.3d 336, 339-40 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"407\">*407</page-number>and n. 3 (5th Cir.2002); <em>Graves v. Cockrell, </em>351 F.3d 143, 155 (5th Cir.2003), <em>reh\u2019g granted in part on other grounds, </em>351 F.3d 156 (5th Cir.2003). Hall\u2019s conclusional assertions do not establish that counsel\u2019s actions deprived him of a fair trial or an effective appeal, nor do his assertions establish that counsel performed ineffectively. <em>See Mayo, </em>287 F.3d at 339-40 and n. 3; <em>Graves, </em>351 F.3d at 155-56. Therefore, the state court\u2019s denial of Hall\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim did not result \u201cin a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\u201d \u00a7 2254(d)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b431-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
