After an unsuccessful direct appeal, in 1998, Hanieph filed in the Eastern District of Virginia a motion under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, challenging his judgment of sentence. The District Court denied the motion. Several years later, in 2006, Hanieph filed with the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals an unsuccessful application under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244 to file a second or successive \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-27\">In 2007, Hanieph filed in the District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> a petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241, challenging the validity of his conviction and sentence. The District Court dismissed Hanieph\u2019s petition and he appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-28\">We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Because Hanieph is proceeding <em>in forma paupens, </em>we must dismiss the appeal if it \u201clacks arguable basis either in law or fact.\u201d <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"58\">*58</page-number>1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989); <em>see also </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2). We exercise plenary-review over the District Court\u2019s legal determinations and apply a clearly erroneous standard to its factual findings. <em>See Cradle v. United States ex rel. Miner, </em>290 F.3d 536, 538 (3d Cir.2002) (per curiam).</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">A federal prisoner challenging the validity of his conviction or sentence must pursue collateral relief under \u00a7 2255 in the district court which imposed his sentence. <em>See </em>\u00a7 2255(a); <em>Cradle, </em>290 F.3d at 538. \u201c[U]nder the explicit terms of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, unless a \u00a7 2255 motion would be \u2018inadequate or ineffective,\u2019 a habeas corpus petition under \u00a7 2241 cannot be entertained....\u201d <em>Cradle, </em>290 F.3d at 538. Here, the District Court reasoned that it lacked jurisdiction over Hanieph\u2019s \u00a7 2241 petition because: (1) he sought to challenge the validity of his conviction and sentence, and (2) failed to show that \u00a7 2255 prevented a fair adjudication of his claims. Hanieph does not contest that he sought to challenge the validity of his conviction and sentence. Rather, he argued that \u00a7 2255 was not an adequate or effective avenue for relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">\u201cA \u00a7 2255 motion is inadequate or ineffective only where the petitioner demonstrates that some limitation of scope or procedure would prevent a \u00a7 2255 proceeding from affording him a full hearing and adjudication of his wrongful detention claim.\u201d <em>Cradle, </em>290 F.3d at 538. \u201cSection 2255 is not inadequate or ineffective merely because the sentencing court does not grant relief, ... or the petitioner is unable to meet the stringent gatekeeping requirements of the amended \u00a7 2255.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 539. We have held \u00a7 2255 to be inadequate and ineffective when the conduct for which an individual was convicted is subsequently made non-criminal, and the petitioner is otherwise barred from filing a \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See In re Dorsainvil, </em>119 F.3d 245, 251 (3d Cir.1997). In such a situation, a petitioner may seek relief under \u00a7 2241. <em>See id. </em>Hanieph relied on the Supreme Court\u2019s decisions in <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004), and <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), for the proposition that \u00a7 2255 is inadequate and ineffective in his case. Although those cases announced new rules of law, neither case decriminalized the conduct for which Hanieph was convicted. Moreover, neither case is retroactive on collateral review. <em>See Wharton v. Bockting, </em>549 U.S. 406, 409, 127 S.Ct. 1173, 167 L.Ed.2d 1 (2007) <em>(Crawford); Lloyd v. United States, </em>407 F.3d 608, 613-14 (3d Cir.2005) <em>(Booker). </em>Thus, Hanieph has failed to show that \u00a7 2255 is ineffective or inadequate as applied to his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-7\">Accordingly, we will dismiss the appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b83-18\">. Hanieph is incarcerated at FCI-McKean, which is within the Western District.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
