Walker first appealed his convictions for possessing with intent to distribute 100 or more marijuana plants, 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), and maintaining a place to manufacture and distribute a controlled substance, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 856(a)(1), and we affirmed, <em>United States v. Walker, </em>272 Fed.Appx.752 (11th Cir.2008) (unpublished). Later, the district court granted Walker\u2019s motion to vacate his sentence, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, reopened Walker\u2019s case, and conducted a new sentencing hearing to detennine if Walker qualified for safety valve relief, United States Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 5C1.2. The district court denied relief on the ground that Walker\u2019s testimony was not \u201cbelievable and credible.\u201d Walker appeals his sentence, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b974-14\">In an appeal of a denial of a motion for relief under the safety valve, we review findings of fact for clear error and the application of law to those facts <em>de novo. United States v. Johnson, </em>375 F.3d 1300, 1301 (11th Cir.2004). We are required to \u201cgive due regard to the opportunity of the district court to judge the credibility of the witnesses, and shall accept the findings of fact of the district court unless they are clearly erroneous.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(e). \u201cThe burden of proof on the truthfulness issue lies, of course, with the defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Espinosa, </em>172 F.3d 795, 797 (11th Cir.1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b974-15\">The district court did not err by denying Walker safety valve relief. To obtain relief under the safety valve, \u201cno[ ] later than the time of the sentencing hearing, the defendant [must] truthfully provide[] to the Government all information and evidence\u201d about his \u201coffense or offenses.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)(5); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.2(a)(5). The district court was familiar with the circumstances of Walker\u2019s case and could consider that information in determining the completeness and veracity of Walker\u2019s statement. <em>See United States v. Brownlee, </em>204 F.3d 1302, 1305 (11th Cir.2000). Walker testified that he did not hear the grow room being constructed, smell the marijuana discovered inside his house, or participate in the grow operation, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"949\">*949</page-number>but those statements are difficult to reconcile with the undisputed evidence at trial about the renovations made to accommodate the sophisticated hydroponic growing system, the strong odor of marijuana emanating from 200 marijuana plants, and the digital scale and packaging materials discovered in Walker\u2019s living quarters. Walker also asserted that he did not know about the grow operation until two or three months before his arrest, yet he admitted that \u201cabout four months before\u201d he was arrested he \u201csaw his son with a clone plant.\u201d Walker insisted that he had blamed his son for the grow operation, but Walker had told law enforcement that his son had moved- out of the house -two months before his arrest and he \u201cdid not want\u201d his son \u201cinvolved with any of this.\u201d The district court did not clearly err in finding that Walker\u2019s testimony was incredible.</p>\n<p id=\"b975-5\">Walker\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
