Stat. \u00a7 760.10(7). Boyland, an African-American, filed a complaint alleging that CCA fired him from his job as a corrections officer in May 2007 in retaliation for filing a 2004 discrimination charge with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"974\">*974</page-number>Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Although not pled in his complaint, Boyland alternatively claimed before the district court that he was fired in retaliation for grievances he voiced to CCA in February and March of 2007.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-4\">On appeal, Boyland first argues that the district court erred in finding that he failed to demonstrate a causal connection between his 2004 EEOC complaint and his 2007 dismissal. Second, he argues that the court erred in finding that he failed to demonstrate that his 2007 grievances were statutorily protected expressions. Finally, Boyland argues that the court erred in finding that he failed to offer sufficient evidence to support a finding that CCA\u2019s reasons for firing him were pretextual.</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-5\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Weeks v. Harden Mfg. Corp., </em>291 F.3d 1307, 1311 (11th Cir.2002). Summary judgment is appropriate when the evidence, viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, presents no genuine issue of material fact and compels judgment as a matter of law. Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c); <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317, 322-23, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2552, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-6\">Federal case law on Title VII applies to FCRA retaliation claims. <em>See Harper v. Blockbuster Entm\u2019t Corp., </em>139 F.3d 1385, 1387 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-7\">In reviewing Title VII claims supported by circumstantial evidence, we use a three-step burden-shifting framework established in <em>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green, </em>411 U.S. 792, 802-05, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 1824-26, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), and <em>Texas Dep\u2019t of Cmty. Affairs v. Burdine, </em>450 U.S. 248, 253, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 1093, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981). The burden is first on the plaintiff to establish sufficient evidence of a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation. <em>McDonnell Douglas, </em>411 U.S. at 802, 93 S.Ct. at 1824. A plaintiff may establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation under Title VII by presenting evidence showing that (1) he engaged in statutorily protected expression, (2) the employer took action that would have been materially adverse to a reasonable employee or job applicant, and (3) there was some causal relation between the two events. <em>Pennington v. City of Huntsville, </em>261 F.3d 1262, 1266 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-9\">Once a plaintiff has established a <em>prima facie </em>case, the burden then shifts to the employer to articulate a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for the challenged employment action. <em>McDonnell Douglas, </em>411 U.S. at 802, 93 S.Ct. at 1824. When the employer meets its burden, the plaintiff must then demonstrate that the employer\u2019s reasons are a \u201cpretext for prohibited retaliatory conduct.\u201d <em>Johnson v. Booker T. Washington Broad. Serv., Inc., </em>234 F.3d 501, 507 n. 6 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-10\">I. Alleged Unlawful Retaliation for 2004 Discrimination Charge</p>\n<p id=\"b1000-11\">To demonstrate a causal connection, a plaintiff can show that the decision makers were aware of the protected conduct, and that the protected activity and the adverse actions were not wholly unrelated. <em>Shannon v. BellSouth Telecomm., Inc., </em>292 F.3d 712, 716 (11th Cir.2002). Causation may be inferred by close temporal proximity between the protected activity and the adverse action by the employer. <em>Thomas v. Cooper Light., Inc., </em>506 F.3d 1361, 1364 (11th Cir.2007). We have held, however, that \u201cin the absence of any other evidence of causation,\u201d a three-month proximity \u201cbetween a protected activity and an adverse employment action is insufficient to create a jury issue on causation.\u201d <em>Drago v. Jenne, </em>453 F.3d 1301, 1308 (11th Cir.2006). In the absence of close temporal proximity between the protected activity and the employer\u2019s adverse action, a plaintiff may be able to establish causation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"975\">*975</page-number>where intervening retaliatory acts commenced shortly after the plaintiff engaged in a protected activity. <em>See Bass v. Bd. of County Comm\u2019rs, </em>256 F.3d 1095, 1117-19 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-5\">Here, there was a two-and-a-half year gap between Boyland\u2019s November 2004 charge and his May 2007 termination. This is well outside the time range for which this Court will infer causal connection from temporal proximity. <em>See Drago, </em>453 F.3d at 1308. Because Boyland produced no other evidence to show that a causal connection existed between his 2004 charge and his termination, he has failed to meet his burden of establishing a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation. Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on Boyland\u2019s claim that he was unlawfully fired in retaliation for his 2004 charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-6\">II. Alleged Unlawful Retaliation for 2007 Grievances</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-7\">The anti-retaliation clause in Title VII recognizes that an employee\u2019s conduct is statutorily protected under the Opposition Clause if he has opposed any employment practice made unlawful by Title VII. <em>Clover v. Total Sys. Servs., Inc., </em>176 F.3d 1346, 1350 (11th Cir.1999). To establish a statutorily protected expression under the Opposition Clause, a plaintiff must show that he \u201chad a good faith, reasonable belief that the employer was engaged in unlawful employment practices.\u201d <em>Little v. United Tech., Carrier Transicold Div., </em>103 F.3d 956, 960 (11th Cir.1997). \u201cUnfair treatment, absent discrimination based on race, sex, or national origin, is not an unlawful employment practice under Title VII.\u201d <em>Coutu v. Martin County Bd. of County Comm\u2019rs, </em>47 F.3d 1068, 1074 (11th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-8\">A legitimate nondiseriminatory reason proffered by the employer is not a pretext for prohibited conduct unless it is shown that the reason was false and that the real reason was impermissible. <em>St. Mary\u2019s Honor Center v. Hicks, </em>509 U.S. 502, 515, 113 S.Ct. 2742, 2752, 125 L.Ed.2d 407 (1993). If the proffered reason is one that might motivate a reasonable employer, a plaintiff cannot merely recast the reason, but must \u201cmeet that reason head on and rebut it.\u201d <em>Chapman v. AI Transport, </em>229 F.3d 1012, 1030 (11th Cir.2000) <em>(en banc). </em>When an employer claims that a plaintiff was fired for violating a work rule, a plaintiff may show pretext through evidence (1) that he did not violate the cited work rule, or (2) that if he did violate the rule, other employees outside the protected class, who engaged in similar acts, were not similarly treated. <em>Damon v. Fleming Supermarkets, Inc., </em>196 F.3d 1354, 1363 (11th Cir.1999). We will not second-guess an employer for firing an employee for lying during an important internal investigation unless the employee produces evidence that the employer lacked a good faith belief that the employee lied. <em>EEOC v. Total Sys. Servs., </em>221 F.3d 1171, 1176 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b1001-12\">Even if we assume, <em>arguendo, </em>that Boyland\u2019s 2007 grievances were statutorily protected expressions, and that he established a <em>prima facie </em>case of retaliation, he still did not establish that CCA\u2019s legitimate, non-discriminatory reasons for terminating him were pretextual. <em>See Cuddeback v. Florida Bd. of Educ., </em>381 F.3d 1230, 1235-36 (11th Cir.2004) (holding that this Court may affirm the district court\u2019s judgment on any ground that finds support in the record and affirming when plaintiff established a <em>prima facie </em>case but failed to establish pretext). CCA proffered that it fired Boyland for violating work policy and lying during a subsequent internal investigation, and Boyland failed to meet these nondiseriminatory reasons head on and rebut them. <em>See Chapman, </em>229 F.3d at 1030. Although he provided evidence of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"976\">*976</page-number>other security breaches committed by CCA employees, none of these breaches are similar to the one Boyland committed, which resulted in an inmate having access to a gun and ammunition. Moreover, Boy-land produced no evidence that any of the other employees who committed breaches lied in the course of the subsequent investigation. Accordingly, the district court properly granted summary judgment on Boyland\u2019s unpled claim that he was unlawfully fired in retaliation for his 2007 grievances. Upon review of the record and upon consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
