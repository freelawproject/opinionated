Munoz asserts that the BIA erred by engaging in impermissible factfinding when it stated that Munoz claimed on appeal that the Immigration Judge (IJ) improperly denied voluntary departure and that no evidence existed in the record that Munoz had applied for this form of relief. Asserting that, under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1008.1(d)(3)(iv), the BIA lacks the power to make findings of fact in the first instance, she requests that this court vacate the BIA decisions and remand the matter to the BIA for further consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-4\">A court can review a final order of removal only when \u201cthe alien has exhausted all administrative remedies available to the alien as of right\u201d. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(d); <em>Omari v. Holder, </em>562 F.3d 314, 318 (5th Cir.2009). \u201cPetitioners fail to exhaust them administrative remedies as to an issue if they do not first raise the issue before the BIA, either on direct appeal or in a motion to reopen.\u201d <em>See Omari, </em>562 F.3d at 318 (citing <em>Heaven v. Gonzales, </em>473 F.3d 167, 177 (5th Cir.2006); <em>Wang v. Ashcroft, </em>260 F.3d 448, 452-53 (5th Cir. 2001)). An exception to the exhaustion requirement exists for claims of due-process violations, \u201cexcept for procedural errors that are correctable by the BIA\u201d. <em>Roy v. Ashcroft, </em>389 F.3d 132, 137 (5th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b420-5\">Contrary to Munoz\u2019 assertions, her motion to reconsider and reopen neither reasserted her initial due-process claim relating to voluntary departure nor asserted the claim she now presents to this court\u2014 that the BIA engaged in impermissible factfinding when it determined that no evidence existed in the record that Munoz had applied for voluntary departure. Munoz\u2019 motion to reconsider and reopen was an available and adequate means of presenting this claimed error to the BIA before asserting it here, which is required under \u00a7 1252(d). <em>See Omari, </em>562 F.3d at 320-21. \u201cBecause [Munoz] has failed to exhaust [her] administrative remedies as to this issue, \u00a7 1252(d) jurisdictionally bars [this court] from addressing it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 321.</p>\n<p id=\"b420-9\">Munoz also asserts that the BIA erred in denying cancellation of removal and in not addressing certain challenges concerning the IJ\u2019s bias and Munoz\u2019 asylum application. Under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)\u00ae, this court generally does not have jurisdiction to review any judgment regarding the granting or denying of discretionary relief in the form of cancellation of removal. Where the appeal involves constitutional claims or questions of law, this court does have jurisdiction. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D). Although Munoz attempts to claim otherwise, essentially, she disagrees with the discretionary decision to deny cancellation of removal. Munoz\u2019 appeal does not involve a constitutional claim or a question of law. Accordingly, we lack jurisdiction to review this issue. <em>See Rueda v. Ashcroft, </em>380 F.3d 831, 831 (5th Cir.2004)</p>\n<p id=\"b420-10\">Munoz also contends that, because the BIA failed to specifically address certain issues, it failed to give meaningful consideration to her appeal and motion to reconsider and reopen. Even if the BIA\u2019s decision does not touch on every disputed fact, it does not mean that the BIA did not consider all of Munoz\u2019 presented facts and allegations. <em>See Osuchukwu v. INS, </em>744 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>F.2d 1136, 1142-43 (5th Cir.1984) (\u201c[The BIA] has no duty to write an exegesis on every contention. What is required is merely that it consider the issues raised, and announce its decision in terms sufficient to enable a reviewing court to perceive that it has heard and thought and not merely reacted\u201d.). The BIA considered Munoz\u2019 stated issues.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-5\">Finally, to the extent Munoz claims her due-process rights were violated because the IJ exhibited bias against her, her claims are unavailing. Munoz has failed to demonstrate that the IJ either held a personal bias against her or demonstrated pervasive bias and prejudice. <em>See Matter of Exame, </em>18 I &amp; N Dec. 303, 306 (BIA 1982); <em>see also Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b421-6\">DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b419-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cm. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
