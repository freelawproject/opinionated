She asserts that her sentence, despite being within the applicable guidelines range, was substantively unreasonable. After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), this court reviews sentences for reasonableness. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 46, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). If the district court\u2019s decision is proeedurally sound, we will \u201cconsider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at 51, 128 S.Ct. 586.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-21\">In her first ground for relief, Pitan asserts that her sentence is substantively unreasonable because it was greater than needed to accomplish the goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). She notes the defense arguments at sentencing focused on the remoteness of the drug offense resulting in the 16-level enhancement, her benign reasons for returning to the United States, and the factors considered by other courts in imposing downward variances in similar cases. Pitan\u2019s disagreement with the within-guidelines sentence imposed does not suffice to rebut the presumption of reasonableness. <em>See id.; United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">Additionally, Pitan contends that the applicable guidelines range of 41-51 months in prison was too severe because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2 was not empirically based. This court has consistently rejected Pitan\u2019s \u201cempirical data\u201d argument. <em>See United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-30 (5th Cir.). <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009). Additionally, Pitan has not established that this court may not apply a presumption of reasonableness to a sentence imposed within the applicable guidelines range. <em>See United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 367 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 192, 175 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009). Consequently, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b447-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined drat this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
