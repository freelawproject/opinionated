He argues that his sentence, which fell within his advisory sentencing guidelines range, is substantively unreasonable because it was greater than necessary to achieve the sentencing goals set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). Aguilar-Moreno contends that his sentence overstates the seriousness of his illegal reentry offense and does not properly account for his personal history and characteristics, including his motive for reentering the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-24\">Citing <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 85, 109-10, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), Aguilar-Moreno contends that his sentence should not be accorded an appellate presumption of reasonableness because U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, the Guideline applicable to violations of \u00a7 1326, is not empirically based and double-counts a defendant\u2019s criminal history. However, Aguilar-Moreno concedes that his challenge to the presumption of reasonableness is foreclosed by our precedent. <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number><em>United States v. Duarte, </em>569 F.3d 528, 529-31 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 130 S.Ct. 378, 175 L.Ed.2d 231 (2009); <em>United States v. Mondragon-Santiago, </em>564 F.3d 357, 366-67 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 130 S.Ct. 192, 175 L.Ed.2d 120 (2009); <em>see also </em>\u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.6).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">Before imposing Aguilar-Moreno\u2019s sentence, the district court judge considered the advisory sentencing guidelines range, the information in Aguilar-Moreno\u2019s pre-sentence report, and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The judge also considered the arguments presented at sentencing and determined that a guideline sentence would be appropriate. Aguilar-Moreno\u2019s arguments do not establish that the district court abused its discretion in imposing that sentence. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). He has not rebutted the presumption of reasonableness that attaches to his within-guidelines sentence. <em>See United States v. Alonzo, </em>435 F.3d 551, 554 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b329-10\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b328-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
