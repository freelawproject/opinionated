On appeal, Strawder argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because it was greater than necessary to achieve the statutory purposes of sentencing.</p>\n<p id=\"b870-21\">We review a sentence for reasonableness, employing an abuse-of-diseretion standard. <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S. 38, 51, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The party challenging the sentence carries the burden of establishing unreasonableness. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-22\">Because Strawder does not offer argument pertaining to the procedural reasonableness of his sentence, he has abandoned any such argument. <em>See United States v. Jernigan, </em>341 F.3d 1273, 1283 n. 8 (11th Cir.2003) (stating that a party abandons an issue if he does not raise it in his initial brief).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-23\">With respect to the substantive reasonableness of Strawder\u2019s sentence, the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"845\">*845</page-number>trict court acted within its discretionary authority by weighing the relevant factors, including Strawder\u2019s criminal history and minimal role in the conspiracy, to arrive at a sentence it determined was sufficient, but not greater than necessary, to comport with the statutory purposes of sentencing. That the district court may have given less weight to the probation officer\u2019s recommendation and Strawder\u2019s admission of guilt than to his extensive criminal history is within its sound discretion. Furthermore, Strawder\u2019s 160-month sentence was within the lower portion of the guidelines range, and also below the statutory maximum of 20 years. Therefore, we conclude that the district court did not commit a \u201cclear error in judgment\u201d by sentencing Strawder to 160-months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
