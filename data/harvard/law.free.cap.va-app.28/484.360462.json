Cavell, was convicted of escape in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-479. On appeal, he contends the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction. We agree and reverse his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-9\">The facts are undisputed. Clad in his police uniform and carrying a bottle of \u201cOC\u201d spray, Officer Lewis approached a crowd involved in a fight. Lewis ordered the crowd to disperse, and, as the crowd broke, Lewis identified appellant among the group. Lewis knew of a felony warrant on file for appellant\u2019s arrest, and he approached appellant intending to arrest him on the warrant. From a distance of approximately ten feet, Lewis stated, \u201cErvin, I need to talk to you.\u201d Appellant responded with profanity and told Lewis to \u201c[g]et away from [him] with [the \u201cOC\u201d spray].\u201d Lewis replied, \u201c[the \u201cOC\u201d spray] is not for you. You are under arrest. You have a felony warrant.\u201d Appellant again responded with profanity. Lewis told appellant, \u201cDon\u2019t run. You are under arrest.\u201d Appellant repeated his profane remark and told Lewis, \u201cI am going to anyway.\u201d At that point, Lewis stood four to five feet from appellant. Lewis testified that he \u201cwas attempting to grab [appellant],\u201d but that he \u201cwasn\u2019t close enough to do it yet.\u201d Before Lewis reached for him, appellant fled. He ran a couple of blocks before he was subdued.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-10\">Code \u00a7 18.2-479 makes it unlawful for \u201cany person ... lawfully in the custody of ... any law-enforcement officer on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"486\">*486</page-number>charge or conviction of a felony\u201d to escape. The question on appeal is whether appellant was \u201clawfully in the custody\u201d of Lewis when he fled.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">In the case before us, appellant concedes he knew he was not free to leave but contends the police officer did not have the immediate physical ability to place him under formal arrest, as required by our holding in <em>Castell v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 78, 82, 461 S.E.2d 438, 439 (1995) <em>(en </em>banc). In <em>Castell, </em>we held that for purposes of Code \u00a7 18.2-479, custody \u201cdoes not require direct physical restraint.\u201d 21 Va.App. at 82, 461 S.E.2d at 439-40.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In reaching this conclusion, we relied upon federal cases construing the federal statutory scheme governing the law of arrest and escape. However, we did not specifically analyze \u201ccustody\u201d within the context of Virginia\u2019s law of arrest. We do so now.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-6\">\u201cWith a few statutory exceptions, ... the common law relating to arrest is the law on that subject in Virginia.\u201d <em>Galliher v. Commonwealth, </em>161 Va. 1014, 1021, 170 S.E. 734, 736 (1933). Under the common law, an arrest required either the application of physical force or, where that was absent, submission to the assertion of authority. <em>California v. Hodari D., </em>499 U.S. 621, 626, 111 S.Ct. 1547, 113 L.Ed.2d 690 (1991); <em>Howard v. Commonwealth, </em>210 Va. 674, 677, 173 S.E.2d 829, 832 (1970) (\u201cOrdinarily, an arrest is made by the actual restraint of the person of the defendant or by his submission to the custody of an officer.\u201d). The immediate physical ability to arrest, without more, was not sufficient to effectuate an arrest. <em>See </em>Rollin M. Perkins, <em>The Law of Arrest, </em>25 Iowa L.Rev. 201, 206 (1940).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"487\">*487</page-number>There can be no arrest [under the common law] without either touching or submission. Hence, if the officer pronounces words of arrest without an actual touching and the other immediately runs away, there is no escape (in the technical sense) because there was no arrest. It would be otherwise had the officer touched the arrestee for the purpose of apprehending him, because touching for the manifested purpose of arrest by one having lawful authority completes the apprehension, \u201calthough he does not succeed in stopping or holding him even for an instant.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-5\"><em>Id. </em>(footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">In the present case, Lewis did not effectuate appellant\u2019s arrest; he neither touched appellant nor obtained appellant\u2019s submission to his show of authority. Each time Lewis spoke to appellant, appellant responded with profanity; when Lewis told appellant not to run, appellant responded that he was going to run, and he did. In short, the evidence shows that appellant did not submit, in any respect, to Lewis\u2019s show of authority, and appellant was not detained by the exercise of any physical restraint at the time he fled. Thus, we hold that appellant was not under arrest and, thus, was not in custody when he fled. In reaching this decision, we overrule the holding in <em>Castell v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 78, 461 S.E.2d 438 (1995) <em>(en </em>banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">Finding that appellant was not in Lewis\u2019s custody at the time he ran, we reverse his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">\n<em>Reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b530-7\">. In <em>Castell, </em>two uniformed officers went to the defendant's house to arrest him on a felony warrant. The defendant's mother answered the door. She went to get the defendant, who appeared and stood about three feet from the officers. One officer asked identifying questions of appellant and informed him that he had a warrant for his arrest. The defendant asked why the warrant had been issued. The officer approached the defendant, reaching for his handcuffs with one hand and reaching to grab the defendant with the other. When the officer was within one inch of the defendant, the defendant turned and ran. <em>Castell, </em>21 Va.App. at 80, 461 S.E.2d at 439.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
