We hold that any error committed was harmless, and we affirm appellant\u2019s convictions.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b658-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-8\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b658-9\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-10\">THE OFFENSE</p>\n<p id=\"b658-11\">Viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the evidence showed that, on January 28, 1997, appellant did not have permission to be in victim\u2019s home. Appellant and victim had engaged in a long-term relationship and had a son with whom appellant remained in contact. However, appellant was not residing with victim on that date, their romantic relationship had ended, and their son was at school.</p>\n<p id=\"b658-12\">Around noon, appellant appeared, uninvited, in victim\u2019s bedroom. Victim testified that she thought the house was locked, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"615\">*615</page-number>and the evidence indicated that appellant had gained entry by removing the storm window in another bedroom. Appellant said, \u201cI got you now, or nowhere to run, or something like that.\u201d Victim tried to run, but appellant pushed her onto the bed. He asked for her keys, took eighty or ninety dollars from her purse, and took her gun from under the bed and loaded it with bullets from the closet. When victim asked appellant what he was going to do with her, he said, \u201churry up, we don\u2019t have much time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">Victim was scared and did not want to leave the house with appellant. Appellant took victim toward the back door, and while he was replacing the storm window he had removed to gain entry, she tried to spray him with pepper spray, but she sprayed herself instead. He struggled with her for the spray, scratching her face, and after he obtained the spray, he tied her hands with a jump rope \u201cso [she] wouldn\u2019t try anything like that again.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b659-6\">Appellant then put her in the passenger seat of her car and drove her into the \u201cinner city ... on a wild drug spree.\u201d He bought drugs \u201c[q]uite a few times\u201d and used a can to smoke crack cocaine. Appellant also made victim write a check for fifty dollars, which he tried to cash at several different banks, but because victim had insufficient funds in the account, no bank would cash it. Victim never saw the gun again and believed appellant \u201cpawned it for drugs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b659-7\">At around 8:00 or 9:00 p.m. that evening, appellant exited the car and let victim drive away. She went to appellant\u2019s mother\u2019s house and was taken to the emergency room by ambulance.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-8\">Later, while appellant was in jail, he apologized to victim for the events and said he was motivated by \u201cthe drugs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b659-9\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-10\">PROCEEDINGS IN THE TRIAL COURT</p>\n<p id=\"b659-11\">After interviewing victim on the day of the offense, police secured warrants against appellant for burglary, larceny of a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>firearm and abduction. In a preliminary hearing on April 21, 1997, the juvenile and domestic relations district court found probable cause and certified the charges to the grand jury. Although appellant requested that the preliminary hearing be transcribed or recorded, the court denied that request, and no record of the proceedings was made.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">On May 5, 1997, the grand jury issued a three-count indictment against appellant for burglary, larceny of a firearm and abduction. Counts one and three of the indictment tracked the language of the burglary and abduction statutes, respectively. The burglary count charged that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A6I\">on or about January 28, 1997 ... [appellant] unlawfully and feloniously did break and enter in the daytime, or enter in the nighttime the home belonging to [victim] with the intent to commit larceny, assault and battery, or a felony other than murder, rape or robbery therein, in violation of Virginia Code \u00a7 18.2-91....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">The abduction count charged that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AaI\">on or about January 28, 1997 ... [appellant] unlawfully, feloniously, and by force, threat or intimidation and without legal justification or excuse did seize, take, transport, detain or secrete the [victim] with the intent to extort money, or pecuniary benefit, or with the intent to defile ... in violation of Virginia Code \u00a7 18.2-48.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b660-7\">Appellant moved the court for a bill of particulars pursuant to Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-230 and 19.2-266.2 and the Due Process Clauses of the United States and Virginia Constitutions. He claimed that the burglary and abduction counts merely tracked the broad language of each statute and failed to notify him of the \u201c \u2018nature and character\u2019 of the offense charged.\u201d He sought an order requiring the Commonwealth to state with specificity (1) the exact time of the alleged burglary and what crime appellant allegedly intended to commit when he entered victim\u2019s dwelling; and (2) the nature of the force, threat or intimidation used against victim; whether appellant was alleged to have \u201cseized, transported], detained] or secretefd]\u201d victim; and what appellant\u2019s intent was at the time of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"617\">*617</page-number>acts \u2014 to extort money, to gain some pecuniary benefit, or to defile victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-4\">Appellant\u2019s counsel conceded that the evidence presented at the preliminary hearing gave her some indication regarding how the Commonwealth planned to proceed, but appellant sought further clarification. Appellant\u2019s counsel contended, for example, that the preliminary hearing evidence for the abduction charge established only that appellant entered victim\u2019s residence with intent to gain some pecuniary benefit. However, the indictment, which tracked the language of the abduction statute, also permitted conviction if appellant abducted victim with the intent to extort or to defile. Although the Commonwealth presented no evidence of either type of intent at the preliminary hearing, appellant\u2019s counsel explained that appellant also had been charged in a neighboring county with raping the victim as part of the same sequence of events and that she needed to know the portion of the statute under which to prepare appellant\u2019s defense. She also contended that \u201can abduction that involves a ransom note is going to be a little bit different than an abduction for pecuniary interest.\u201d Finally, she indicated that if the court granted her request for a bill of particulars, she would not have to file a motion attacking counts one and three of the indictment as overbroad and seeking to strike the surplusage from them.</p>\n<p id=\"b661-5\">The Commonwealth\u2019s attorney stated that the law did not require her to elect the portion of each statute under which she planned to proceed and that she would not do so. When the court asked the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney which portion of the burglary statute the Commonwealth was proceeding under, she indicated that it was proceeding on \u201cmore than one.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b661-6\">The trial court denied the motion for a bill of particulars, noting that \u201c[t]he nature of the offense is told to [appellant] not only in the indictment but, also, he\u2019s had a preliminary hearing. He is not entitled to know each specific piece of evidence that supports that. The Commonwealth doesn\u2019t have to provide that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b662-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"618\">*618</page-number>At appellant\u2019s bench trial on the abduction charge, the Commonwealth presented no evidence that appellant raped the victim in a neighboring county, and it agreed that the abduction was supported by an intent to gain pecuniary benefit and not by an intent to defile. On the burglary charge, the Commonwealth presented evidence that the entry occurred during a daytime breaking and that, following entry, appellant committed (1) larceny of money and a firearm, (2) assault and battery by telling victim she had nowhere to run and pushing her onto the bed and struggling with her and tying her up after the pepper spray incident, and (3) abduction by forcing victim to accompany him to her bank and on a \u201cwild spree to buy drugs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b662-5\">The trial court held that the evidence failed to prove that appellant abducted victim for pecuniary gain and convicted him of the lesser-included abduction offense in Code \u00a7 18.2-47(A), which did not require a finding of any additional intent. The trial court convicted appellant of burglary under the charged statute without specifying the underlying offense or offenses upon which it relied. It also convicted him of larceny of a firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-7\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b662-8\">Appellant contends the indictment failed to notify him of the \u201c \u2018nature and character\u2019 of the offense[s] charged\u201d because it did not specify (1) under Code \u00a7 18.2-91, what time of day the alleged burglary occurred and what crime appellant allegedly intended to commit once he gained entry, and (2) under Code \u00a7 18.2-48, what force appellant allegedly used to seize victim and for what purpose he allegedly abducted her. We disagree and affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b662-9\">Code \u00a7 19.2-220 provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b662-10\">The indictment or information shall be a plain, concise and definite written statement, (1) naming the accused, (2) describing the offense charged, (3) identifying the county, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>city or town in which the accused committed the offense, and (4) reciting that the accused committed the offense on or about a certain date. In describing the offense, ... the indictment or information may state so much of the common law or statutory definition of the offense as is sufficient to advise what offense is charged.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b663-5\">The indictment should also \u201ccite the statute or ordinance that defines the offense or, if there is no defining statute or ordinance, prescribes the punishment for the offense.\u201d Rule 3A:6(a). \u201c[T]he function of an indictment ... is to give an accused notice of the nature and character of the accusations against him in order that he can adequately prepare to defend against his accuser.\u201d <em>Willis v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 430, 437-38, 393 S.E.2d 405, 409 (1990); <em>see </em>U.S. Const. amend. VI; Va. Const. art. I, \u00a7 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b663-6\">Ordinarily, an indictment sufficiently charges a statutory offense if it follows the language of the statute. <em>See Herchenbach v. Commonwealth, </em>185 Va. 217, 220-21, 38 S.E.2d 328, 329 (1946). However, this rule \u201cdoes not apply when the statutory language does not in itself fully and clearly set forth all the material elements of the offense.\u201d 2 Charles E. Torcia, <em>Wharton\u2019s Criminal Procedure </em>\u00a7 265, at 127 (13th ed.1990); <em>see State v. Greer, </em>238 N.C. 325, 77 S.E.2d 917, 920 (N.C.1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b663-7\">\u201cA court of record may direct the filing of a bill of particulars at any time before trial.\u201d Code \u00a7 19.2-230. However, a defendant is not entitled to a bill of particulars as a matter of right.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See Goins v. Commonwealth, </em>251 Va. 442, 454, 470 S.E.2d 114, 123 (1996). As long as an indictment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>sufficiently recites the elements of the offense, the Commonwealth is not required to include all evidence upon which it plans to rely to prove a particular offense, and an accused should not be permitted to use a bill of particulars to expand the scope of discovery in a criminal case. <em>See Quesinberry v. Commonwealth, </em>241 Va. 364, 372, 402 S.E.2d 218, 223 (1991). However, the Commonwealth \u201cshould be required to fairly particularize the charge or charges [it] intends to prosecute, and not be permitted to go on a fishing expedition with a drag net. \u2018[An indictment or bill of particulars] should be directed at those charges as to which the prosecuting attorney expects to introduce supporting testimony.\u2019 \u201d <em>Casper v. City of Danville, </em>160 Va. 929, 933, 169 S.E. 734, 735 (1933). Whether to require the Commonwealth to file a bill of particulars rests within the discretion of the trial court. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b664-5\">If a trial court abuses its discretion in failing to order a bill of particulars, that error does not necessarily require reversal. Where the accused is not sufficiently apprised of \u201cthe nature and cause of the accusation,\u201d U.S. Const. amend. VI, the error is of constitutional magnitude and is \u201charmless [if] the reviewing court is \u2018able to declare a belief that it was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lavinder v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va. App. 1003, 1005, 407 S.E.2d 910, 911 (1991) <em>(en </em>banc) (quoting <em>Chapman v. California, </em>386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 828, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967)). Where the accused has been apprised of the \u201cnature and character of the accusation,\u201d any other sort of error is non-constitutional. Such an error is harmless</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b664-6\">\u201c[w]hen it <em>plainly appears </em>from the record and the evidence given at trial that the parties .have had a fair trial on the merits and substantial justice has been reached.\u201d Code \u00a7 8.01-678 (emphasis added). \u201c[A] fair trial on the merits and substantial justice\u201d are not achieved if an error at trial has affected the verdict. An error does not affect a verdict if a reviewing court can conclude, without usurping the <em>jury\u2019s </em>fact finding function, that, had the error not occurred, the verdict would have been the same.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b665-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"621\">*621</page-number><em>Id.; see also </em>Rule 3A:6(a) (providing that \u201c[e]rror in the citation of the statute\u201d is not reversible \u201cunless the court finds that [it] prejudiced the accused in preparing his defense\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">SUFFICIENCY OF BURGLARY INDICTMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">Appellant contends the trial court erred in not ordering the Commonwealth to file a bill of particulars on the burglary indictment to specify the time of day the offense occurred and the crime or crimes appellant intended to commit upon entry.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-8\">As to the time of day the offense occurred, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the request. This portion of the indictment followed the language of the statute, reciting the specific statutory element, \u201cdid break and enter in the daytime, or enter in the nighttime.\u201d <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-90, 18.2-91. Although the language did not specify which of the time requirements the Commonwealth was relying upon, even without a bill of particulars, appellant had received specific information regarding when the Commonwealth alleged the offense occurred. Counsel for appellant noted at the hearing on the motion for a bill of particulars that the preliminary hearing evidence indicated the entry occurred during the daytime. In response to questions from the trial court on this issue, the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney indicated that appellant\u2019s counsel was present \u201cat the preliminary hearing and is well aware of what the actual crime was.\u201d Although the evidence adduced at a preliminary hearing will not serve as a substitute for a bill of particulars, even without a bill of particulars, appellant was apprised of the specific time of the offense, and has not shown that he was prejudiced by the court\u2019s failure to require a bill of particulars.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-9\">Appellant also contends he was entitled to a bill of particulars specifying what crime or crimes the Commonwealth alleged he intended to commit upon entering victim\u2019s residence. Here, too, the Commonwealth tracked the language of the statute, alleging that appellant \u201cinten[ded] to commit larceny, assault and battery, or a felony other than murder, rape or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>robbery.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-91. At the hearing on the motion for a bill of particulars, the Commonwealth proffered that the evidence raised an issue of fact as to all three categories of intent. In fact, appellant was simultaneously indicted for actually committing larceny (larceny of a firearm) and a felony other than murder, rape or robbery (abduction). It is clear from the indictments that the Commonwealth was intending to charge and prove as predicate offenses at least larceny and assault and battery. In tracking the language of the statute, the Commonwealth specified the crimes for which it would offer evidence of appellant\u2019s intent to commit. <em>Cf. Akers v. Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 40, 47-48, 216 S.E.2d 28, 32-33 (1975) (under murder indictment, Commonwealth may prove killing in any manner or in different manners and was not required to elect whether it was proceeding against accused on theory that murder either was willful, deliberate and premeditated or occurred in the commission of certain enumerated felonies, including abduction); <em>Abdell v. Commonwealth, </em>173 Va. 458, 473, 2 S.E.2d 293, 299 (1939) (noting that, in many cases, \u201cthe mode of death is uncertain\u201d and \u201c[e]very cautious pleader ... will insert as many counts as will be necessary to provide for every possible contingency in the evidence\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b666-5\">Although an indictment properly may charge multiple intents, we hold, as the Commonwealth concedes, that a burglary indictment which charges that the accused entered the premises with the intent to commit a \u201cfelony other than murder, rape or robbery\u201d does not set forth the element of intent specifically enough to apprise the accused of the nature and character of the offense. <em>See Taylor v. Commonwealth, </em>207 Va. 326, 332, 150 S.E.2d 135, 140 (1966) (noting in dicta that burglary indictment charging that accused broke and entered \u201c \u201cwith intent ... to commit a felony [failed to] apprise[ ] [the accused] of the offense which he is required to answer\u201d). Under the facts of this case, however, we hold that any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. As noted above, appellant was indicted for abduction and burglary simultaneously, thereby informing the accused that abduction was the \u201cfelony other than murder, rape or robbery\u201d that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>appellant was accused of intending to commit when he entered victim\u2019s residence. Appellant specified no other predicate offense for which he felt obligated to prepare a defense, and he does not contend that he was surprised or unprepared for the evidence at trial. The only harm he alleged is the anxiety he experienced due to the uncertainty that the Commonwealth might present evidence of other crimes, such as the charged rape in the adjoining county. Despite appellant\u2019s anxiety, the trial court\u2019s error in not requiring the Commonwealth to particularize which felony or felonies on which it would rely was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-6\">SUFFICIENCY OF ABDUCTION INDICTMENT</p>\n<p id=\"b667-7\">Appellant contends the trial court should have required the Commonwealth to specify what \u201cnature of force\u201d appellant used to seize victim. We disagree. The abduction statute includes as an element that the illegal seizure occurred \u201cby force, intimidation or deception.\u201d <em>See </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-47, 18.2-48. The Commonwealth, by specifying in the indictment that the abduction was accomplished \u201cby force, threat or intimidation,\u201d sufficiently notified appellant of the nature of the charge against him. Requiring the Commonwealth to file a bill of particulars further describing the <em>nature </em>of the force used would have required disclosure of the evidence upon which it planned to rely to prove this element. Therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion on this point.</p>\n<p id=\"b667-8\">Appellant also contends the trial court should have required the Commonwealth to elect the specific intent or intents upon which it relied to charge abduction under Code \u00a7 18.2-48. Assuming without deciding that appellant was entitled to know which of the three specific intents enumerated in Code \u00a7 18.2-48 the Commonwealth intended to prove, <em>see Hughes v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 510, 530, 446 S.E.2d 451, 463 (1994) <em>(en banc) </em>(Coleman, J., concurring) (noting that \u201ca person often acts with two or more criminal inten<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>tions\u201d), we hold that the trial court\u2019s failure to require disclosure of this information was harmless. After hearing all the evidence, the trial court convicted appellant under Code \u00a7 18.2-47, a lesser-included offense of Code \u00a7 18.2418. Code \u00a7 18.2-47 requires proof only of an intent to deprive victim of his or her liberty, whereas Code \u00a7 18.2-48 requires proof of the additional intent \u201cto extort money[,] ... [for] pecuniary benefit,\u201d or \u201cto defile.\u201d In light of this lesser conviction and because appellant has alleged no specific prejudice from this denial, we hold that the trial court\u2019s error, if any, was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-5\">For these reasons, we affirm appellant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b658-13\">. Appellant was indicted for abduction under Code \u00a7 18.2 \u2014 48, but the trial court convicted him of the lesser-included offense specified in Code \u00a7 18.2-47(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b658-14\"><em>. </em>Appellant also was convicted of larceny of a firearm. However, we denied the petition for appeal on all issues related to that conviction and, therefore, do not consider that conviction in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b663-8\">. Appellant contends that Code \u00a7 19.2-266.2 required the court to order a bill of particulars. However, that statute operates only where the defendant seeks (1) suppression of evidence as violative of search and seizure or self-incrimination protections or (2) dismissal of an indictment \"on the ground that a statute upon which it was based is unconstitutional.\u201d Appellant has not alleged any grounds to bring this statute into play. His constitutional claims relate only to the non-specificity of the indictment and do not reach the constitutionality of the underlying statutes he was charged with violating.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
