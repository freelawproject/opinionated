The Rule, as amended, provides that an appellant\u2019s failure to timely file a notice with the clerk of the trial court that a transcript has been filed is not a ground for dismissal of an appeal unless an appellee can show material prejudice as a result of appellant\u2019s failure. \u201cFor purposes of this Rule [5A:8], material prejudice includes preventing the appellee from raising legitimate objections to the contents of the transcript or misleading the appellee about the contents of the record.\u201d Rule 5A:8(b). The appellee has the burden of establishing such prejudice. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b143-15\">Here, appellant failed to timely file a notice of transcript filing. Appellee filed a motion to dismiss this appeal. In the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"100\">*100</page-number>motion, appellee makes no claim that he was materially prejudiced.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant filed a response to the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-5\">Because appellee has not shown that he was materially prejudiced by appellant\u2019s failure to timely file the notice, appellee has not met the burden imposed on him by Rule 5A:8(b). Consequently, we deny his motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b144-6\">The members of the bar may benefit from the issue addressed in this order. Therefore, we direct the Clerk to publish this order.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b144-14\">. Appellee claims that as a result of appellant's failure to timely file the notice of transcript filing, \"the transcripts in this matter are not a part of the record herein.\" Appellee cites no support for this proposition. The assertion is not true. The filing of the transcripts themselves is governed by Rule 5A:8(a), not 5A:8(b), and the transcripts in this case were timely filed.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
