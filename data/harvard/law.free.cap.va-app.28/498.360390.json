She contends the evidence was legally insufficient to support her conviction because the person she aided in committing the abduction was the natural father of the child abducted, giving him legal justification for taking the child. The Commonwealth contends appellant failed properly to preserve this argument for appeal. For the reasons that follow, we hold that appellant\u2019s assignment of error was properly preserved, and we reverse the abduction conviction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b545-9\">At about 1:00 a.m. on December 26, 1996, appellant and her fiance, Avery Moore, arrived at the home of Meshia Powell, ostensibly to see Tasean, the ten-month-old son of Powell and Moore. Powell and Moore had never been married and had not lived together. Powell had cared for the child since his birth. Moore was not present for the birth, had seen the child only once, and had never paid child support. No custody order was then pending or in effect.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-10\">Prior to going to Powell\u2019s home that morning, Moore and appellant went to the home of Powell\u2019s aunt. Moore told Powell\u2019s aunt \u201che had come to take the baby\u201d and wanted to telephone Powell. Appellant told Moore to tell Powell that Moore\u2019s mother was with them and wanted to see the child. Powell's aunt did not see Moore\u2019s mother.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-11\">Moore telephoned Powell and told her he and his mother wanted to see the child and that he had gifts for the child; he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>did not tell Powell he intended to take the child. Powell gave Moore her address so they could come to see the child. When Moore and appellant departed, Powell\u2019s aunt called Powell\u2019s stepmother and told her Moore said he intended to take the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-5\">When Moore and appellant arrived at Powell\u2019s home, Powell\u2019s father opened the door. Moore and appellant \u201ckind of pushed [him] away from the door and came in and asked for [Powell].\u201d As Powell\u2019s father called her, Moore kept saying he wanted to see the child and hold him. Powell came downstairs with the child but refused to let Moore hold him and began to go back upstairs. Appellant came up behind Powell on the stairs, began to argue with her about Moore\u2019s holding the child, and pushed Powell. The child fell from Powell\u2019s arms, and appellant and Powell started fighting. Appellant picked up the child and passed him to Moore. Powell tried to come back down the stairs, but \u201c[appellant] was blocking the steps so [Powell] couldn\u2019t get by.\u201d Powell\u2019s father somehow got the child, and he and Moore struggled for the child. During the struggle, Moore called another male in the car to hold the door open. Appellant jumped in the car, started it, and kept calling to Moore. When Powell\u2019s father let go of the baby, allowing Moore to hold him in order to prevent the baby from being hurt, appellant said \u201churry up\u201d and \u201cget in the car.\u201d Moore got into the car with the child, and appellant drove off.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">Powell got the license number of their vehicle and reported the incident to police. North Carolina police stopped appellant and Moore but, about an hour later, allowed them to continue on to their home in Georgia.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">On January 2, 1997, police arrested appellant and Moore in Decatur, Georgia, and retrieved the child. After being <em>Mirandized, </em>appellant made a brief written statement. In it, she denied handing Moore the child, said she fought Powell in self-defense, and denied driving the car from the scene. At trial, she contended that she and Moore had no advance plans to take the baby, that she hit Powell in self-defense, that she did <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>not help Moore take the child and that she continuously encouraged him to return the child. In contrast to her written statement, she admitted driving the car from the scene, but she insisted she drove only to the next house because she did not have a valid driver\u2019s license. She admitted she knew Moore had the child in the car when she drove off and that she made no effort to call Powell from Georgia.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">Appellant moved to strike the abduction charge at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence. She contended that Moore had a legal right to take the child because no custody order was in effect and that, because Moore was not guilty of abduction, she could not be guilty as a principal in the second degree. The court denied the motion. In closing, appellant argued (1) that the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence was inconsistent, not credible, and failed to prove she participated in the taking of the child, and (2) that even if the evidence was credible, she could not be convicted because Moore could not be found guilty of abducting his own child when no custody order was in effect. The trial court rejected these arguments and convicted -her of abduction. The court also convicted her of assault and battery, but she challenges only the abduction conviction on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-7\">PROCEDURAL BAR</p>\n<p id=\"b547-8\">The Commonwealth contends that Rule 5A:20 bars appellant\u2019s challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence on appeal. Under that rule, it contends, appellant had a duty to give a \u201cclear and exact reference\u201d to the pages of the record on which she preserved each issue for appeal. <em>See </em>Rule 5A:20(d). Appellant cited the pages of the transcript on which she made a motion to strike at the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, but, reasons the Commonwealth, she waived the right to rely on that motion by presenting evidence of her own, and she did not cite any additional portion of the record to show that she again brought the sufficiency issues to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>attention of the trial court following completion of her evidence, as necessary to preserve the issue for appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">We disagree with the Commonwealth\u2019s argument. A defendant who moves to strike the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, presents evidence of her own, and fails to renew her motion to strike at the completion of her case nevertheless may renew her objection to the sufficiency of the evidence in other ways, such as in closing argument to the court. <em>See, e.g., Campbell v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 476, 478-81, 405 S.E.2d 1, 1-3 (1991) <em>(en banc). </em>Appellant\u2019s closing argument in this case was sufficient under the contemporaneous objection rule to preserve the issues she raises on appeal. <em>See, e.g., id.; </em>Rule 5A:18. Her mere failure to specify the pages of the transcript on which her closing argument appears is not a bar to her appeal. The provisions of Rule 5A:20 are not jurisdictional.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-7\">SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">Appellant contends the evidence was legally insufficient to support her abduction conviction. Appellant argues that the absence of a custody order gave Moore, as a natural parent, the \u201clegal justification\u201d necessary to take the child without violating Code \u00a7 18.2-47 and that, because Moore\u2019s actions did not constitute abduction, appellant could not be convicted for being a principal in the second degree. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">Under Code \u00a7 18.2-47(A),</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-10\">[a]ny person, who, by force, intimidation or deception, and without legal justification or excuse, seizes, takes, transports, detains or secretes the person of another, with the intent to deprive such other person of his personal liberty or to withhold or conceal him from any person, authority or institution lawfully entitled to his charge, shall be deemed guilty of \u201cabduction\u201d.... Abduction for which no punish<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>ment is otherwise prescribed shall be punished as a Class 5 felony.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">One who is \u201cpresent, aiding and abetting, and intend[s] his or her words, gestures, signals, or actions to in some way encourage, advise, urge, or in some way help the person committing the crime to commit it\u201d is a principal in the second degree. <em>McGill v. Commonwealth, </em>24 Va.App. 728, 733, 485 S.E.2d 173, 175 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">\u201c[Code \u00a7 18.2-47] provides that <em>any person, </em>except a law enforcement officer in the performance of his duty, may be prosecuted for violation of its provisions.\u201d <em>Diehl v. Commonwealth, </em>9 Va.App. 191, 194, 385 S.E.2d 228, 230 (1989). However, the key portion of the statute in this case remains the \u201cwithout legal justification\u201d prong, for \u201cany person\u201d may violate the statute only if he or she acts \u201cwithout legal justification.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-47(A). We held in <em>Diehl v. Commonwealth, </em>9 Va.App. 191, 385 S.E.2d 228, that a parent may be convicted for abduction under this code section when he or she acts with the first intent enumerated in the statute \u2014 \u201cthe intent to deprive [the abductee] of his personal liberty.\u201d <em>Diehl </em>involved parents who jointly abducted their adoptive teen-aged son, by shackling and paddling him, ostensibly as a means of discipline. <em>Id. </em>at 193-95, 385 S.E.2d at 229-31. <em>Diehl </em>did not involve a dispute <em>between </em>parents for exclusive custody and, therefore, did not address the second intent enumerated in the statute \u2014 \u201cintent ... to withhold or conceal [the abductee] from any person, authority or institution lawfully entitled to his charge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">Whether a natural parent is legally justified, under Code \u00a7 18.2-47(A), in taking custody of his or her child to the exclusion of the other natural parent in the absence of an order determining custody is a question of first impression in Virginia. Other states considering the issue have held that \u201ceach parent has an equal right to custody of a child in the absence of a court order\u201d and that \u201ca parent does not commit the crime of kidnapping by taking exclusive possession of the child where no such order exists.\u201d <em>See State v. Stocksdale, </em>138 N.J.Super. 312, 350 A.2d 539, 541 (NJ.Super. Ct. Law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>Div.1975); <em>see also </em>William B. Johnson, Annotation, <em>Kidnapping or Related Offense by Taking or Removing of Child by or Under Authority of Parent or One In Loco Parentis, </em>20 A.L.R.4th 828 \u00a7 3 (1983 &amp; Supp.1997). <em>But see State v. Donahue, </em>140 Ariz. 55, 680 P.2d 191, 193 (Ariz.Ct.App.1984) (under custodial interference statute including \u201clegal justification\u201d prong, holding that father\u2019s right was \u201cat most a right ... co-equal ... with the child\u2019s natural mother\u201d and that \u201c[h]e did not have the right to custody of the child to the exclusion of the natural mother\u201d without \u201ca court order to that effect\u201d); <em>State v. Butt, </em>656 A.2d 1225, 1226-27 (Me.1995) (under statute proscribing criminal restraint by a parent, which contained \u201clegal justification\u201d prong, holding that right to custody was joint and that jury could find father violated statute by exercising exclusive custody). Construing this principle in conjunction with Code \u00a7 18.2-47, we conclude that the natural parent of a child does not act \u201cwithout legal justification\u201d under the statute when he or she \u201cseizes, takes, transports, detains or secretes\u201d the child \u201cwith the intent [only] ... to conceal him from [the child\u2019s other natural parent] ... lawfully entitled to his charge.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">To hold that a child\u2019s natural parent acts \u201cwithout legal justification\u201d under Code \u00a7 18.2-47(A) in such circumstances would contravene legislative intent. A fundamental rule of statutory construction provides \u201cthat a statute must be construed from its four corners and not by singling out particular words or phrases.\u201d <em>Smith v. Commonwealth, 8 </em>Va.App. 109, 113, 379 S.E.2d 374, 376 (1989). \u201cIf the several provisions of a statute suggest a potential for conflict or inconsistency, we construe those provisions so as to reconcile them and to give full effect to the expressed legislative intent.\u201d <em>Mejia v. Commonwealth, </em>23 Va.App. 173, 176-77, 474 S.E.2d 866, 868 (1996) <em>(en banc). </em>\u201c[A] statute should never be construed so that it leads to absurd results. In addition, penal statutes must be strictly construed against the Commonwealth and applied only in those cases clearly falling within the language of the statute.\u201d <em>Branch v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 836, 839, 419 S.E.2d 422, 424 (1992) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b551-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>Code \u00a7 18.2-47(A) provides that \u201c[a]bduction for which no punishment is otherwise proscribed shall be punished as a Class 5 felony.\u201d Subsection (B) provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ASH\">[i]f such offense is committed by the parent of the person abducted and punishable as a contempt of court in any proceeding then pending, [it] shall be a Class 1 misdemean- or in addition to being punishable as a contempt of court. Provided further, however, that [if] ... the person abducted is removed from the Commonwealth by the abducting parent, [it] shall be a Class 6 felony in addition to being punishable as a contempt of court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">To construe Code \u00a7 18.2-47(A) in the manner the Commonwealth urges would result in illogically disproportionate treatment of offenders. A parent taking his or her natural child with intent \u201cto withhold or conceal\u201d the child from the other natural parent at a time when no custody proceeding was pending would be guilty of a Class 5 felony under subsection (A). However, if a parent committed the same act while a custody proceeding was pending, he or she would be guilty of a lesser offense, a Class 1 misdemeanor or a Class 6 felony, depending on the circumstances. To conclude that the legislature intended to punish parental abduction during the pendency of a custody proceeding as a lesser crime than the same act committed when no custody proceeding had been initiated defies logic.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">Therefore, we construe Code \u00a7 18.2-47 to provide that, if no custody proceedings are pending, the natural parent of a child may not be convicted for abducting the child \u201cwith the intent ... to withhold or conceal him from any person ... lawfully entitled to his charge\u201d; if no custody proceedings are then pending, the natural parent acts with \u201clegal justification\u201d as that term is used in Code \u00a7 18.2-47(A). Therefore, Moore\u2019s actions in taking the child did not constitute abduction.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The Commonwealth nevertheless contends that appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>lant was properly convicted of abduction as a principal in the second degree even if Moore\u2019s parental status prevented him from being convicted for abducting the child. We disagree and hold that the trial court erred in convicting appellant of abduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">A split of authority exists regarding whether an agent or other person present with and assisting a parent to gain exclusive custody of a child may be found guilty of kidnapping when the parent himself has committed no illegal act.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number><em>Stocksdale, </em>350 A.2d at 541; Annotation, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 4. The majority view holds that a parent\u2019s agent may not be held hable; the minority view holds that, because only the parent has a right to custody, parental immunity does not shield one who helps the parent. <em>See Stocksdale, </em>350 A.2d at 541; <em>Wilborn v. Superior Ct., </em>51 Cal.2d 828, 337 P.2d 65, 66 (Cal.1959) <em>(en banc).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">We believe the majority view is the better reasoned. As explained in <em>Stocksdale,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-6\">[A]ny person who aids or abets another to commit a crime is punishable as a principal.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-7\">There is no prerequisite to a conviction of an aider and abettor that the principal be tried and convicted. Each participant in an illegal venture is required to \u201cstand on his own two feet.\u201d An aider or abettor, for example, may generally be convicted where the principal has a defense personal to himself which exonerates him from criminal responsibility.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-8\">There are, however, exceptions to this general rule of accessorial liability. Accomplice liability, for example, is not sustained where the defense of one party not only exonerates himself but also changes the character of the act so that it can no longer be viewed as criminal in nature.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"APM\">350 A.2d at 543-44 (citations omitted). In a parental abduction case like ours, appellant\u2019s liability as a principal in the second degree is wholly derivative of Moore\u2019s liability. The existence of legal justification for Moore\u2019s actions does not simply immunize him from criminal liability; rather, it so \u201cchanges the character of the act ... that it can no longer be viewed as criminal in nature.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 544. Therefore, appellant\u2019s acts in aiding and abetting Moore, like Moore\u2019s acts, did not violate Code \u00a7 18.2-47.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-9\">For the foregoing reasons,- we hold (1) that a parent does not commit abduction in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2^47(A) when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>he takes his child from the custody of the child\u2019s other natural parent \u201cwith the intent [only] to withhold or conceal him from [the other natural parent] lawfully entitled to his charge\u201d as long as no custody order is then pending or in effect, and (2) that one who aids that parent in taking the child also does not commit abduction. Accordingly, we reverse and dismiss appellant\u2019s abduction conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">\n<em>Reversed and dismissed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b545-12\">. Appellant also contends the evidence was factually insufficient to support her conviction because the testimony of the Commonwealth\u2019s witnesses was inconsistent and incredible. Because we reverse on the legal sufficiency issue, we do not reach the factual sufficiency issue.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b551-7\">. The holdings in <em>Bausell v. Commonwealth, </em>165 Va. 693, 181 S.E. 462 (1935), and its companion case do not require a different result. <em>See Bausell v. Commonwealth, </em>165 Va. 669, 181 S.E. 453 (1935). Those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>cases involved a father\u2019s use of extreme physical force to regain custody of his three-year-old daughter from the child's mother, resulting in death to the mother and her relative and injury to the father and his relative. <em>See </em>165 Va. at 674, 181 S.E. at 454. In trying father\u2019s relative for murder, the court instructed the jury that father and his relative \u201cdid not have the right to break into [mother\u2019s] bedroom ... to secure possession of [the child].\u201d 165 Va. at 695, 181 S.E. at 463. On appeal of the murder conviction of father\u2019s relative, the Supreme Court agreed, holding:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-7\">The father\u2019s right to the possession of his three-year-old daughter, as against the right of the mother, is a qualified right to be decided by the court in a proper proceeding. This qualified right does not entitle the father to regain the custody of his child [with force and arms], so long as the child is in the possession of the mother, and is in no serious danger.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b552-9\">The holding in <em>Bausell </em>made no reference to the crime of abduction, and the above-quoted language stands for nothing more than the general proposition that one cannot use unreasonable force to regain that to which he has a lawful right. <em>See, e.g., Goodwin v. Commonwealth, </em>23 Va.App. 475, 483-84, 477 S.E.2d 781, 785 (1996). Although entitled to possession or custody, one may still be punished for using unreasonable force to regain that possession or custody. <em>See id. </em>In <em>Bausell, </em>such force resulted in charges for murder. In appellant\u2019s case, it resulted in a conviction for assault and battery which appellant does not challenge on appeal. These principles do not support the argument that either Moore or appellant was guilty of abduction in the case at bar.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b552-10\">. We need not decide whether a parent's right to custody of his or her child may be delegated to an agent to exercise either in the presence of the delegating parent or in his absence. <em>See Wilborn v.
