Green (defendant) appeals his convictions of carjacking, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-581, and the use of a firearm in the commission of a carjacking, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1. He contends the trial court erroneously ruled that, upon conviction, Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 required imposition of a mandatory three-year sentence. Because we find no error in the trial court\u2019s ruling, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-9\">The evidence adduced at trial proved that defendant and an accomplice stopped Josie Majette in the parking lot of the Sentara Hampton General Hospital on February 22, 1997. Defendant threatened to use a gun if Ms. Majette did not relinquish her car keys. When Ms. Majette did so, defendant and his accomplice fled in her vehicle. They were later stopped for a different offense and arrested. Defendant was fifteen years old at the time of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b612-10\">Defendant was transferred to the circuit court pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-269.1 and tried as an adult for carjacking and use of a firearm in the commission of a carjacking. Defendant was found guilty of both offenses. At defendant\u2019s sentencing hearing, the Commonwealth asserted Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 required the trial court to impose a three-year, unsuspended sentence for the firearm offense. Defendant\u2019s counsel requested that defendant be given a suspended sentence pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-272(A)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b612-11\">The trial court ruled that \u201cthe firearm section [Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1] and its mandatory sentence, did take precedence\u201d over the juvenile code sentencing provisions. The trial court, therefore, imposed a three-year sentence for that offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"569\">*569</page-number>Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 contains an extremely restrictive sentencing provision whereby:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-4\">Violation of this section shall constitute a separate and distinct felony and any person found guilty thereof shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of three years for a first conviction, and for a term of five years for a second or subsequent conviction under the provisions of this section. <em>Notwithstanding any other provision of law, </em>the sentence prescribed for a violation of the provisions of this section shall not be suspended in whole or in part, nor shall anyone convicted hereunder be placed on probation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b613-5\">(Emphasis added). However, Code \u00a7 16.1-272(A)(1) provides that a juvenile convicted of a violent felony will be sentenced as an adult \u201cbut the sentence may be suspended conditioned upon successful completion of such terms and conditions as may be imposed in a juvenile court upon disposition of a delinquency case.\u201d At first blush, these code sections appear to conflict because one allows what the other specifically prohibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b613-6\">Appellate courts called upon to interpret statutes have relied upon the following principles:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b613-7\">While in the construction of statutes the constant endeav- or of the courts is to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the legislature, that intention must be gathered from the words used, unless a literal construction would involve a manifest absurdity. Where the legislature has used words of a plain and definite import the courts cannot put upon them a construction which amounts to holding the legislature did not mean what it has actually expressed.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AtP\"><em>Caprio v. Commonwealth, </em>254 Va. 507, 512, 493 S.E.2d 371, 374 (1997) (citing <em>Barr v. Town &amp; Country Properties, </em>240 Va. 292, 295, 396 S.E.2d 672, 674 (1990)). When a statute is clear and unambiguous, \u201ca court may look only to the words of the statute to determine its meaning.\u201d <em>Hubbard v. Henrico Ltd. Partnership, </em>255 Va. 335, 339, 497 S.E.2d 335, 337 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b613-8\">The statutes in question use easily understood terms to impart an equally clear meaning. Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 states <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"570\">*570</page-number>that courts \u201cshall\u201d sentence one convicted of the use of a firearm in the commission of a felony to a mandatory sentence \u201c[notwithstanding any other provision of law.\u201d The word \u201cnotwithstanding\u201d is defined as \u201cwithout prevention or obstruction from or by.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>1545 (1993). Given that understanding of the word, we conclude that the terms of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 are not limited by other incongruous laws because the General Assembly intended Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 to function \u201cwithout obstruction\u201d from them. Nothing in Code \u00a7 16.1-272 contradicts this interpretation. Further, Code \u00a7 16.1-272 does not contain mandatory language as does Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-4\">Our interpretation of the statutes is also in concert with our opinion in <em>LaFleur v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 190, 366 S.E.2d 712 (1988). In <em>LaFleur, </em>we interpreted Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 in light of Code \u00a7 19.2-311, which allowed alternate sentencing for certain youthful offenders. We found that the purpose of Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 was \u201c \u2018to deter violent criminal conduct rather than to reform the most dangerous class of criminals.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 192, 366 S.E.2d at 713 (quoting <em>Ansell v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 759, 763, 250 S.E.2d 760, 763 (1979)). To apply the juvenile sentencing provisions in place of the mandatory sentence in Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 \u201cwould substitute a discretionary penalty for an inflexible one.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Because \u201c[t]he General Assembly has directed a contrary policy which courts must follow,\u201d we held a mandatory sentence was rightfully imposed. <em>Id. </em>We are under no less a burden to follow the General Assembly\u2019s clear mandate in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-5\">We hold that Code \u00a7 18.2-53.1 required the trial court to impose a three-year, unsuspended sentence despite the provisions of Code \u00a7 16.1-272. Because the trial court did not err by imposing the sentence, we affirm defendant\u2019s convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b614-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
