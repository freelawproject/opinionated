He contends the evidence was insufficient as a matter of law to sustain the convictions and that the trial judge erred in allowing expert testimony of \u201cstreet-gang\u201d culture. We disagree and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b459-10\">\u201cSelf-defense is an affirmative defense which the accused must prove by introducing sufficient evidence to raise a reasonable doubt about his guilt.\u201d <em>Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>17 Va.App. 68, 71, 435 S.E.2d 414, 416 (1993). Whether the evidence raises such a reasonable doubt is a question of fact that will not be disturbed on appeal unless plainly wrong or unsupported by the evidence. <em>See Yarborough v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 971, 979, 234 S.E.2d 286, 292 (1977). Words alone, no matter how insulting, are not sufficient to justify assault. <em>See Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>192 Va. 186, 189, 64 S.E.2d 761, 763 (1951); <em>Roark v. Commonwealth, </em>182 Va. 244, 252, 28 S.E.2d 693, 696 (1944). The trier of fact may infer malice from the deliberate use of a deadly weapon. <em>See Perricllia v. Commonwealth, </em>229 Va. 85, 91, 326 S.E.2d 679, 683 (1985); <em>Doss v. Commonwealth, </em>23 Va.App. 679, 685-86, 479 S.E.2d 92, 96 (1996). Moreover, \u201cevidence of flight may be considered as evidence of guilt along with other pertinent facts and circumstances.\u201d <em>Hope v. Commonwealth, </em>10 Va.App. 381, 386, 392 S.E.2d 830, 833 (1990) <em>(en </em>banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"416\">*416</page-number>\u201cOn appeal, we review the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom.\u201d <em>Martin v. Commonwealth, 4 </em>Va.App. 438, 443, 358 S.E.2d 415, 418 (1987). So viewed, the evidence proved that appellant possessed a concealed weapon that he used to fatally shoot the victim in the forehead at close range. Saul Palma, nicknamed \u201cPrimo,\u201d was a friend of the victim. Palma testified that he and the victim, nicknamed \u201cSnoopy,\u201d had been outside, at night, near an apartment complex when some \u201cyelling\u201d attracted the victim\u2019s attention. The victim had been drinking. The victim and appellant exchanged insults and argued as the victim crossed a bridge and walked toward appellant. Palma and one or two others followed the victim, who approached a group of approximately ten people in a parking lot. Appellant and the victim stood face to face. The victim \u201craised his hands as if he was going to fight.\u201d Appellant \u201cmade a half turn\u201d and fired a single shot at close range at the victim\u2019s head. After firing, appellant said two or three times to Palma and Palma\u2019s friends, \u201cyou want more.\u201d Palma stated that, as the victim approached, everyone with appellant \u201cstarted walking away towards\u201d their car. Appellant, however, \u201cstayed on the sidewalk\u201d and did not move or turn away as the victim approached him. After appellant shot the victim, he left in a car that was accompanied by another car. Palma never saw a gun or other weapon in the victim\u2019s hands and, as far as he knew, nobody in the group that he was with made any gestures indicating that they possessed a weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">William Martinez was with the victim and Palma and corroborated much of Palma\u2019s testimony. Martinez and Palma followed the victim toward the parking lot. Martinez never saw the victim with a weapon, nor did he see a weapon near the victim\u2019s body after the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">Frank Saffelle, Jr. testified that he operates a tow truck that regularly patrols the parking lot where the shooting occurred. On the night of the murder, he towed a Ford Explorer from the parking lot to a storage lot a few miles away. After towing the Explorer, Saffelle returned to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"417\">*417</page-number>parking lot. While there, he heard \u201cwords [being] exchanged,\u201d then he heard a gunshot. Saffelle saw a car leave \u201cwith the lights out like in a real fast manner of leaving ... immediately after the shot went off.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">Shortly after the shooting, Officer James Wasem was told that the shooting suspects may have been \u201cpotentially involved in a tow dispute,\u201d so he proceeded to Saffelle\u2019s storage lot. About ninety minutes after the shooting, a car containing five males arrived at the lot. Appellant was one of the five occupants who were taken into custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">Officer Andrew Baciocco arrived at the crime scene to recover and document any evidence. Baciocco testified that no weapons were found at or around the crime scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">Officer Noel Hanrahan interviewed appellant following his arrest. After concluding a taped interview, appellant asked Hanrahan how the police caught him. Hanrahan testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A8B\">He asked if we had followed the car that he was stopped in along with several others over by the tow company lot, if we had followed him from the apartment house. And I told him, no, that we had staked out Brownie\u2019s Ford Explorer at the tow lot. He put his head down, started shaking it back and forth, and said we\u2019d never would have gotten him if he hadn\u2019t gone there.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">Numerous friends of appellant who were present at the scene testified. Although they testified, contrary to the testimony of Palma and Martinez, that the victim kept a hand hidden under his shirt, none of those witnesses saw the victim brandish a weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-9\">Appellant testified that the victim approached him, cursing. When the victim asked appellant \u201care you ready to die now, puto?,\u201d appellant said he \u201cturned around and shot the gun.\u201d Appellant said he \u201cthought he was going to die.\u201d On cross-examination, appellant testified that \u201c[w]hen he was right behind me, I was looking out the corner of my eye, and when he said the last thing, I just turned and went like that. Boom.\u201d Appellant stated that the victim appeared to have a weapon because he had a \u201cbulge\u201d under his shirt.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"418\">*418</page-number>The fact finder believed the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence and rejected the evidence presented by appellant, including his theory of self-defense. \u201cThe weight which should be given to evidence and whether the testimony of a witness is credible are questions which the fact finder must decide.\u201d <em>Bridgeman v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 523, 528, 351 S.E.2d 598, 601 (1986). The Commonwealth\u2019s evidence was competent, was not inherently incredible, and was sufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant was guilty of second degree murder and the attendant firearm charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">A. EVIDENCE OF GANG AFFILIATION AND CULTURE</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">On December 4, 1996, the trial court heard argument on a motion <em>in limine </em>concerning the Commonwealth\u2019s intent to introduce expert testimony from Detective Paul Kozich about the characteristics and culture of street gangs and, particularly, about the gangs of which the victim and appellant were respective members. Appellant argued that such testimony was not probative of the ultimate issue in the case, namely, whether he acted in self-defense when he shot the victim, and, if probative, it was overly prejudicial. The Commonwealth asserted that the proposed testimony would be relevant to rebut appellant\u2019s self-defense claim and to show that appellant had a motive, other than self-defense, for shooting the victim. The trial court ruled that the testimony was \u201crelevant to both the Commonwealth\u2019s case, their theory of their case, and to the defendant\u2019s theory of self-defense.\u201d However, the trial court also ruled that \u201c[tjhere should be limits____ I think you have to limit it to the areas that you were referring to today in your motions.\u201d In response to defense counsel\u2019s request that he \u201creconsider at a later point based on any authority that we may be able to come up with,\u201d the trial judge replied, \u201cYou can always do that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-10\">\u201cEvidence is relevant if it has any logical tendency, however slight, to establish a fact at issue in the case.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"419\">*419</page-number><em>Ragland v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 913, 918, 434 S.E.2d 675, 678 (1993).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-4\">[W]hen relevant evidence is offered which may be inflammatory ... its relevancy \u201cmust be weighed against the tendency of the evidence to produce passion and prejudice out of proportion to its probative value.\u201d The responsibility for balancing these competing considerations is largely within the sound discretion of the trial judge. And a trial court\u2019s discretionary ruling will not be disturbed upon appeal absent a clear abuse of discretion.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-5\"><em>Coe v. Commonwealth, </em>231 Va. 83, 87, 340 S.E.2d 820, 823 (1986) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">Although motive is not a necessary element of murder, \u201c \u2018it is relevant and often most persuasive upon the question of the actor\u2019s intent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Archie v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 684, 690, 420 S.E.2d 718, 722 (1992) (quoting <em>Epperly v. Commonwealth, </em>224 Va. 214, 232, 294 S.E.2d 882, 892-93 (1982)). <em>See also King v. Commonwealth, </em>243 Va. 353, 367, 416 S.E.2d 669, 677 (1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">There is little Virginia case law addressing the admissibility of evidence of gang membership. In <em>Payne v. Commonwealth, </em>233 Va. 460, 357 S.E.2d 500 (1987), the defendant was convicted of murdering an inmate with whom he was incarcerated. On appeal, Payne alleged that the trial court erroneously admitted \u201ctestimony from a fellow inmate that defendant wished to be a member of the \u2018Pagans\u2019 motorcycle group, which apparently had an active local chapter within the correctional facility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 465, 357 S.E.2d at 503. The fellow inmate testified that Payne told him that he needed to prove himself in order to become a member of the \u201cgroup\u201d and that he would \u201c \u2018automatically become a Pagan\u2019 when he became a \u2018killer.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>Finding the evidence admissible, the Supreme Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-8\">Even though the prosecution is not required to prove motive, evidence of motive is relevant to establish a defendant\u2019s intent. According to the evidence, the main reason that defendant killed the victim was because the victim may have <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"420\">*420</page-number>\u201csnitched\u201d on defendant, who had planned to escape from the facility, and because the victim had reneged on a drug deal in which defendant had paid the victim $500 cash to procure drugs for him. An additional motive, according to the evidence, was defendant\u2019s desire to be feared as a killer in order to join the local chapter of the \u201cPagans.\u201d Manifestly, this evidence was relevant and properly admissible.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Apv\"><em>Id. </em>at 465-66, 357 S.E.2d at 503.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">Although gang membership alone is not evidence of a defendant\u2019s prior bad conduct, a juror might associate a defendant with such an affiliation as a person of bad character or someone prone to aggressive or violent behavior. Therefore, we analyze the admissibility of such evidence under the prior bad act standard. Evidence of prior bad conduct is not admissible to prove that the defendant is a person of bad character and more likely to commit the offense charged; however, it is admissible in certain situations. As with all evidence deemed relevant, before it can be admitted, the trial judge must balance its relevance against the resultant prejudice.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-6\">\u201cEvidence of other independent acts of an accused is inadmissible if relevant only to show a probability that the accused committed the crime for which he is on trial because he is a person of bad or criminal character.\u201d However, such evidence is admissible when it is \u201crelevant to an issue or element in the present case.\u201d \u201c[I]f such evidence tends to prove any of the relevant facts of the offense charged and is otherwise admissible, it will not be excluded merely because it also shows him to be guilty of another crime.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-7\">Accordingly, we have held that evidence of prior bad acts may be properly admitted</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b464-8\">(1) to prove motive to commit the crime charged; (2) to establish guilty knowledge or to negate good faith; (3) to negate the possibility of mistake or accident; (4) to show the conduct and feeling of the accused toward his victim, or to establish their prior relations; (5) to prove opportu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"421\">*421</page-number>nity; (6) to prove identity of the accused as the one who committed the crime where the prior criminal acts are so distinctive as to indicate a modus operandi; or (7) to demonstrate a common scheme or plan where the other crime or crimes constitute a part of a general scheme of which the crime charged is a part.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b465-5\">\u201cWith respect to these exceptions, the test is whether \u2018the legitimate probative value outweighs the incidental prejudice to the accused.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b465-6\"><em>Reynolds v. Commonwealth, </em>24 Va.App. 220, 223-24, 481 S.E.2d 479, 481 (1997) (citations omitted). <em>See also Guill v.

Gang membership has frequently been found to be probative and admissible, for example, as evidence of a possible motive for the crime, particularly in homicide cases where the defendant and his victim are shown to have been members of rival gangs; as an indication of possible bias on the part of defense witnesses who are shown to be members of the defendant\u2019s gang---- Courts holding that such evidence should have been excluded in the case at hand have generally held that it had not been shown to be probative of the issues presented, that the point it related to was relatively minor, or that point could have been made with other, less prejudicial evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b466-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"422\">*422</page-number>John E.

Abel, </em>469 U.S. 45, 47, 105 S.Ct. 465, 83 L.Ed.2d 450 (1984), Ehle, a government witness, implicated Abel in a robbery in which Ehle was also involved. Abel called Mills, an inmate, as a witness. <em>See id. </em>Mills, who was not involved in the robbery, testified that Ehle told him that he \u201cintended to implicate [Abel] falsely.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In rebuttal, the government recalled Ehle, who testified that he, Abel, and Mills were members of a secret prison gang. <em>See id. </em>Although Abel did not testify, the Court ruled that the government\u2019s witness could testify about the gang\u2019s tenets and that such evidence was admissible to impeach Mills and to show his bias. <em>See id. </em>at 49.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">Other jurisdictions addressing the admissibility of evidence of gang membership or gang activity make a threshold determination whether such evidence is relevant to an issue in the case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> If the evidence is deemed relevant, the trial court must decide whether its admission constitutes unfair prejudice.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b467-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"423\">*423</page-number>Here, the gang-related evidence was relevant to establish a motive for the murder and was probative of appellant\u2019s intent.

EXPERT TESTIMONY ABOUT GANGS</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">\u201cExpert testimony is appropriate to assist triers of fact in those areas where a person of normal intelligence and experience cannot make a competent decision.\u201d <em>Swiney v. Overby, </em>237 Va. 231, 233, 377 S.E.2d 372, 374 (1989). The expert testimony must be relevant, and the trial judge must determine whether the subject matter of the testimony is beyond a lay person\u2019s common knowledge and whether it will assist the trier of fact in understanding the evidence or in determining a fact in issue. <em>See Farley v. Commonwealth, </em>20 Va.App. 495, 498-99, 458 S.E.2d 310, 312 (1995). \u201cThe admis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>sion of expert testimony is committed to the sound discretion of the trial judge, and we will reverse a trial court\u2019s decision only where that court has abused its discretion.\u201d <em>Brown v.

At the time of trial, he was \u201cdetailed to the ATF Gang Task Force in Northern Virginia.\u201d He received \u201cover 300 hours of training involving drug gangs or drug investigations and much of that has to do with gang investigations.\u201d In addition, Kozich received \u201capproximately 200 hours of gang-related training\u201d conducted by \u201cvarious experts from Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, DEA, FBI, [and] INS.\u201d Kozich explained that he teaches classes and conducts lectures about gangs for numerous law enforcement organizations and civic groups. He testified that, \u201con a national level, I get information bulletins from virtually all over the country.\u201d</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b469-8\">On a more regional level, [he is] a member of a group called MARGIN, which stands for Metro Area Regional Gang Investigative Network. That\u2019s a group of investigators from the Washington Metropolitan area. There are approximately 52 agencies which range from Baltimore down to Stafford County. And [they] meet once a month, and [they] exchange information on gangs because gangs very often cross jurisdictional boundaries.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b469-9\">Kozich has conducted surveillance of local gangs, and he regularly receives reports from the local police regarding gang activity. He explained that he was familiar with appellant\u2019s gang and with the victim\u2019s gang.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-10\">Kozich described the two kinds of gangs which exist in the area. According to Kozich, \u201c[t]here is either a gain- or economic- or asset-type of gang or the other type would be a turf-oriented gang.\u201d Kozich was familiar with the gang of which appellant was a member, the Tiny Rascals Gang (\u201cTRG\u201d), and the gang of which the victim was a member, Mai <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>Sal Latruca<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> (\u201cMS\u201d). Kozich characterized both gangs as \u201cturf-oriented\u201d gangs. He explained: \u201c[T]he individuals that are involved in these gangs are not involved for the purpose of profit like a, for example, a drug gang would be. These individuals are there often for self identity, and, ... sometimes the gang becomes a sort of substitute family for the individual members.\u201d Kozich further explained that, because a \u201cturf-oriented\u201d gang\u2019s \u201cmotive is not profit, very often ... the leader is the person who is most notorious or the most violent or the person who has the gun at the time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">On cross-examination, Kozich agreed that the victim lived in the area where the shooting occurred and that appellant and his friends were likely on \u201cturf\u201d claimed by the MS gang, of which the victim was a member. Kozich also agreed that when a gang member approaches someone with his hand concealed, \u201c[i]t could mean that he\u2019s armed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b470-6\">Based on Kozieh\u2019s extensive experience with and knowledge of gangs, he was qualified to testify as an expert. Because the subject matter was beyond the common knowledge and experience of ordinary jurors, the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in allowing Kozich to testify about gang culture in order to show motive and intent and to rebut appellant\u2019s claim of self-defense. Moreover, the evidence showed that the victim was a member of another gang that occupied the area where the shooting occurred. That evidence was beneficial to appellant and supported his theory that the victim was the aggressor, thus belying the prejudice that appellant claims he suffered.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">At trial, Kozich was asked to define a gang. He explained:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b470-8\">The way we define a gang in Arlington County is when a group meets a certain criteria. And those \u2014 that criteria is five or more people, they have a unique name, they display symbols, which is usually in the form of hand signs or tatoos <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"427\">*427</page-number>or the things they use in graffiti, they claim some kind of turf, they associate on a regular basis, and most importantly they\u2019re involved in some sort of criminal or illegal activity.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">Defense counsel objected, the jury was excused, and appellant moved for a mistrial. The trial judge refused to grant a mistrial but admonished counsel to \u201c[cjlear that up\u201d lest he \u201cinstruct them.\u201d After the jury returned, the prosecutor asked Kozich, \u201c[I]s it fair to say that not everyone in a gang commits a crime?\u201d Kozich agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">Appellant failed to argue on appeal that the trial judge erred in refusing to grant a mistrial. Instead, he contends Kozich\u2019s statement further prejudiced him. Appellant conceded in his brief that \u201cthe Trial Court gave a curative instruction,\u201d but he contends that \u201cit is impossible to expect ordinary persons to completely erase what they have just heard.\u201d In a written stipulation received by the jury, appellant admitted to a prior conviction for carrying a concealed weapon. Moreover, two of appellant\u2019s witnesses, Joy ISfouanelady and Marcus Lee, admitted having prior convictions that were proper subjects of impeachment. Because of the prompt corrective action taken regarding Kozich\u2019s statement, and in light of the fact that the jury was aware of criminal convictions involving appellant and two of his witnesses, we find no \u2022additional, excessive prejudice requiring reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">Accordingly, the convictions appealed from are affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b466-7\">.
