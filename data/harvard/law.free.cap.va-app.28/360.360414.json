On appeal, Peeples contends the trial judge erred in refusing to admit expert testimony regarding Peeples\u2019s mental state, which was offered to negate malice and to aid in his claim of self-defense. For the reasons that follow, we hold that the evidence was admissible because it tended to aid his claim of self-defense. Therefore, we reverse Peeples\u2019s convictions and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-7\">At trial, Paul Hicks testified that on the evening of August 24, 1996, he and Richard Harvey were walking along a street when Peeples drove by. Hicks called to Peeples, whom he had known for many years. Peeples parked his car, exited the vehicle with Ross Jefferson, and asked Hicks and Harvey if they wanted to purchase a \u201cblunt\u201d \u2014 a hollowed out cigar stuffed with marijuana \u2014 for two dollars. When Hicks and Harvey gave Peeples two dollars, Peeples rolled the marijuana blunt. However, Peeples refused to give the marijuana blunt to Hicks and Harvey because Peeples wanted to smoke it with them. After Hicks and Peeples argued, Hicks grabbed the marijuana blunt. Peeples walked away, leaving Hicks, Harvey, and Jefferson.</p>\n<p id=\"b407-8\">Peeples returned a few minutes later and walked into an alley with the three young men. Peeples continued to argue with Hicks, who was then smoking the marijuana. During the argument, Peeples withdrew a gun and shot Hicks twice, once in each leg. Harvey, who was standing nearby, asked Peeples what he was doing. Peeples replied, \u201cY\u2019all want to fuck with me?,\u201d and chased Harvey down the street. Peeples then returned and shot Hicks three more times, twice in the abdomen and once in the head, while Hicks was lying on the ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>Harvey testified that all four of the teenagers had known each other for many years. He testified that he and Hicks each gave Peeples one dollar for the marijuana blunt. Harvey\u2019s testimony of events was consistent with Hicks\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-5\">The surgeon who operated on Hicks testified that the shots to Hicks\u2019s legs had a \u201cstraight-through trajectory\u201d and the shots to the abdomen and head had a \u201cdownward trajectory.\u201d He testified that the shot to the head appeared to come from behind the ear and exit through the nose. Hicks lost vision in his right eye as a result of the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-6\">Peeples, who was sixteen years of age and in the eighth grade, testified in his own defense. He testified that the events began when Hicks and Harvey asked him to change a twenty dollar bill. When Peeples displayed his money in the alley, Hicks said, \u201cWe\u2019re taking this.\u201d Harvey said, \u201cYeah. That\u2019s right. We\u2019re taking it,\u201d and began reaching to his waist as if he had a gun. Peeples said he was scared, thought he was being robbed, and believed he would have been shot because Hicks had a reputation for violence and other people had been robbed in the neighborhood. Peeples testified that he panicked, drew his gun, and pulled the trigger without aiming.</p>\n<p id=\"b408-7\">Before trial, the Commonwealth made a motion <em>in limine </em>to exclude the testimony of Dr. Michelle Nelson, a psychologist, who would testify concerning Peeples\u2019s mental condition at the time of the offense. The trial judge reserved ruling on that motion. At trial, Peeples\u2019s counsel proffered that Dr. Nelson would testify that Peeples was mildly mentally retarded. Peeples\u2019s counsel also proffered that Dr. Nelson would testify that because of \u201cthe particular way that [Peeples\u2019s] mind is affected, he has extreme difficulty correctly interpreting social situations. He tends to miss the point exactly what is happening and reacts inappropriately.\u201d Peeples\u2019s counsel argued that Dr. Nelson\u2019s testimony regarding the way in which Peeples mentally perceived social situations would be relevant to two issues: (1) whether Peeples acted under heat of passion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>rather than with malice when he shot Hicks and (2) whether the shooting was an excusable act of self-defense. The trial judge granted the Commonwealth\u2019s motion to exclude the testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">The jury convicted Peeples of aggravated malicious wounding and use of a firearm in the commission of this offense. At the sentencing hearing, Dr. Nelson testified that Peeples has a cognitive impairment and is mentally retarded with an IQ of 55. She also testified that \u201cPeeples is likely to interpret social situations differently than most people____ [H]e has problems with impulse control, he\u2019s likely to jump to conclusions that other people wouldn\u2019t necessarily jump to.\u201d The trial judge sentenced Peeples, a juvenile, to twenty-five years on the aggravated malicious wounding charge and three years on the firearm charge. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 16.1-272.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">\u201cAs a general rule, a litigant is entitled to introduce all competent, material, and relevant evidence tending to prove or disprove any material issue raised, unless the evidence violates a specific rule of admissibility.\u201d <em>Tarmac Mid-Atlantic, Inc. v. Smiley Block Co., </em>250 Va. 161, 166, 458 S.E.2d 462, 465 (1995). \u201cEvidence is admissible if it is both relevant and material,\u201d and it is inadmissible if it fails to satisfy either of these criteria. <em>Evans-Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>5 Va.App. 188, 196, 198, 361 S.E.2d 436, 441, 442 (1987). \u201cEvidence is relevant if it has any logical tendency, however slight, to establish a fact at issue in the case.\u201d <em>Ragland v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 913, 918, 434 S.E.2d 675, 678 (1993). \u201cEvidence is material if it relates to a matter <em>properly </em>at issue.\u201d <em>Evans-Smith, </em>5 Va.App. at 196, 361 S.E.2d at 441 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">Peeples contends that Dr. Nelson\u2019s testimony was relevant to prove self-defense. Peeples argues that his point of view, state of mind, and the manner in which he perceives events were material to the issue of whether he reasonably feared death or serious bodily injury at the time of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>shooting and that Dr. Nelson\u2019s testimony was relevant to proving his mental condition and his perception of social situations. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">Self-defense is a recognized defense to a criminal charge in Virginia. <em>See McGhee v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 560, 562, 248 S.E.2d 808, 810 (1978).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b410-6\">\u201cHomicide [or wounding] in self-defense may be either justifiable or excusable. If it is either, it entitles the prisoner to an acquittal.\u201d In either case, he is deemed to be innocent and guiltless of any crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b410-7\"><em>Bailey v. Commonwealth, </em>200 Va. 92, 96, 104 S.E.2d 28, 31 (1958) (citations omitted). Assessing whether a particular act was committed in self-defense is distinct from determining whether its commission was intentional. In making a plea of self-defense, \u201ca defendant implicitly <em>admits the killing [or wounding] was intentional.\u201d McGhee, </em>219 Va. at 562, 248 S.E.2d at 810 (emphasis added). Instead, the issue in a plea of self-defense is whether the accused\u2019s admittedly intentional act was either justifiable or excusable. <em>See id.; cf. Barrett v. Commonwealth, </em>231 Va. 102, 106, 341 S.E.2d 190, 192 (1986) (stating that \u201c[a] plea of self defense and a claim of provoked heat of passion do not conflict with each other\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">The \u201ccrucial issues\u201d in a plea of self-defense are the defendant\u2019s <em>\u201cstate of mind </em>at the time of the shooting and how the circumstances reasonably appeared to [the defendant] at that time.\u201d <em>Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>217 Va. 226, 229, 228 S.E.2d 124, 125 (1976) (emphasis added). The test of self-defense is whether the defendant reasonably feared \u201cdeath or serious bodily harm to himself at the hands of his victim.\u201d <em>McGhee, </em>219 Va. at 562, 248 S.E.2d at 810. \u201cIt is not essential to the right of self-defense that the danger should in fact exist.\u201d <em>Id. </em>However, \u201c[t]he bare fear that a man intends to commit murder [or inflict serious bodily injury], however well grounded, unaccompanied by any overt act indicative of such an intent, will not warrant killing [or injuring] the party by way of prevention.\u201d <em>Harper v. Commonwealth, </em>196 Va. 723, 731, 85 S.E.2d 249, 254 (1955) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>Unlike other tests used to evaluate whether conduct was legally \u201creasonable,\u201d the Supreme Court has emphasized that the test of whether an accused\u2019s fear was sufficiently reasonable to justify acting in self-defense is based upon the accused\u2019s <em>subjective </em>point-of-view rather than the reaction of an ordinary person to similar circumstances.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See McGhee, </em>219 Va. at 562, 248 S.E.2d at 810 (noting the \u201csubjective nature of the defense\u201d of self-defense). \u201c[Wjhether the danger is reasonably apparent is always to be determined from the viewpoint of the defendant at the time he acted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although most jurisdictions require that a defendant\u2019s fear be both subjectively real and objectively reasonable before a homicide or wounding will be justified or excused on the ground of necessity, the Supreme Court has expressly rejected any objective component in Virginia\u2019s test.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">The Supreme Court has ruled as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b412-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>\u201c \u2018What reasonably appeared to the accused at the time of the shooting, as creating the necessity for his act, is the test and <em>not tvhat reasonably appeared to him, provided it would so appear to some other reasonable person under similar circumstances.\u2019 \u201d</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b412-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 562, 248 S.E.2d at 810 (quoting <em>Harper, </em>196 Va. at 731, 85 S.E.2d at 254) (emphasis added); <em>see Taylor v. Commonwealth, </em>185 Va. 224, 227-28, 38 S.E.2d 440, 441 (1946) (holding trial judge erred in giving jury instruction on self-defense which stated that the accused\u2019s fear should be evaluated from both the accused\u2019s subjective point-of-view and from the perspective of \u201ca reasonable man placed under similar circumstances\u201d).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus, unlike in the context of determining <em>mens rea, </em>the accused\u2019s mental state and manner of perception are material issues to a plea of self-defense, regardless of whether an insanity defense has been raised. <em>See Craig v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 842, 844, 419 S.E.2d 429, 431 (1992) (holding that when a claim of self-defense is made \u201cthe acts must be viewed through the eyes of the person allegedly threatened\u201d); <em>cf. Jacobs v. Jacobs, </em>218 Va. 264, 267, 237 S.E.2d 124, 126 (1977) (in civil context, question of duress \u201cis to be determined on consideration of the surrounding circumstances <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>such as age, sex, capacity, situation, and relation of the parties\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\">In light of the subjective test for determining the reasonableness of a defendant\u2019s fear in a plea of self-defense, the trial judge erred when he concluded that Dr. Nelson\u2019s testimony had no tendency to prove a material issue. The record indicates Dr. Nelson would have testified that Peeples had an IQ of 55, was \u201clikely to interpret social situations differently than most people,\u201d had \u201cproblems with impulse control,\u201d and was \u201clikely to jump to conclusions that other people wouldn\u2019t necessarily jump to.\u201d This evidence is probative of Peeples\u2019s state of mind and manner of perception at the time of the shooting.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">In addition, Dr. Nelson\u2019s testimony was relevant to the credibility of Peeples\u2019s testimony that he actually feared serious bodily injury at the hands of Hicks and Harvey. Peeples testified that he feared he was being robbed by Hicks and Harvey and could possibly be shot. According to Peeples, Harvey reached for what Peeples believed was a gun. Peeples testified he responded by firing his gun in a panic. In assessing the credibility of Peeples\u2019s version of the facts, the jury had to determine first, whether Peeples had an honest belief that he was in danger, and second, whether, from Peeples\u2019s perspective, Harvey\u2019s reaching motion, along with the comments of Harvey and Hicks that they were taking Peeples\u2019s money, were \u201cindicative of a present purpose to make the apprehended attack.\u201d <em>Stoneman v. Commonwealth, </em>66 Va. (25 Gratt.) 887, 900 (1874). Dr. Nelson\u2019s expert opinion about Peeples\u2019s mental condition would have tended to prove whether Peeples\u2019s testimony represented a truthful account of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>his actual interpretation of his encounter with Hicks and Harvey.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">The holding in <em>Stamper v. Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 707, 324 S.E.2d 682 (1985), excluding proof of a defendant\u2019s mental state with psychiatric evidence, has no application to this aspect of this case because, unlike in <em>Stamper, </em>the issue of Peeples\u2019s mental state was properly at issue. The applicability of <em>Stamper\u2019s </em>rule of exclusion is limited to those criminal cases where the accused\u2019s mental state is not a material issue. Although the holding of <em>Stamper </em>is broadly worded and might be read as prohibiting the admission of expert psychiatric opinion regarding a defendant\u2019s mental condition during the guilt phase of a criminal case unless insanity is raised as a defense,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> the Supreme Court has sanctioned the use of such evidence for at least one other purpose. In <em>Greenfield v. Commonwealth, </em>214 Va. 710, 204 S.E.2d 414 (1974), the Supreme Court tacitly approved the admissibility of a psychiatrist\u2019s opinion regarding the defendant\u2019s mental state when the defense of \u201cunconsciousness\u201d had been raised. <em>See id. </em>at 713-14, 204 S.E.2d at 417-18 (noting that the defense of unconsciousness may be raised by \u201cpersons of sound mind\u201d); <em>see also LeVasseur v. Commonwealth, </em>225 Va. 564, 586, 304 S.E.2d 644, 656 (1983) (stating that \u201c[w]hen ... no insanity defense is interposed, the defendant\u2019s mental condition is only relevant insofar as it might be probative of <em>a fact in issue </em>\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"A3t\">The Supreme Court\u2019s subsequent treatment of <em>Stamper </em>further indicates that psychiatric opinion is inadmissible during the guilt phase only when a defendant\u2019s mental state is not properly at issue. In <em>Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>239 Va. 243, 389 S.E.2d 871 (1990), the Court restated the holding of <em>Stamper </em>in more refined terms. It noted that \u201c[i]n <em>Stamper v. Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 707, 324 S.E.2d 682 (1985), we held that \u2018[u]nless an accused contends that he was beyond [the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>borderline of insanity] when he acted, <em>his mental state is immaterial </em>to the issue of specific intent.\u2019 \u201d <em>Smith, </em>239 Va. at 259, 389 S.E.2d at 879 (emphasis added). <em>Smith, </em>like <em>Stamper, </em>was a case in which no insanity defense was raised and psychiatric evidence regarding the defendant\u2019s mental condition was offered to prove whether he possessed the requisite <em>mens rea </em>of the crime charged. <em>Id. </em>at 258-60, 389 S.E.2d at 879-80.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">Thus, we conclude <em>Stamper </em>does not compel the exclusion of Dr. Nelson\u2019s testimony as it pertains to self-defense because the issue of Peeples\u2019s mental state was properly at issue once he raised this defense. As the Supreme Court has noted, a defendant\u2019s state of mind is a \u201ccrucial issue[ ]\u201d to determining whether his or her fear of serious bodily harm was subjectively reasonable under the circumstances. <em>Jones, </em>217 Va. at 229, 228 S.E.2d at 125.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-7\">HARMLESS ERROR</p>\n<p id=\"b415-8\">The Commonwealth contends that if the trial judge erred, the error was harmless insofar as it related to the jury\u2019s finding of guilt. We disagree,</p>\n<p id=\"b415-9\">To be harmless \u201c \u2018it [must] plainly appear[ ] from the record and the evidence ... that\u2019 the error did not affect the verdict.\u201d <em>Lavinder v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 1003, 1005, 407 S.E.2d 910, 911 (1991) <em>(en </em>banc) (quoting Code \u00a7 8.01-678). \u201cAn error does not affect a verdict [only] if a reviewing court can conclude, without usurping the jury\u2019s fact finding function, that, had the error not occurred, the verdict would have been the same.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b415-10\">After reviewing the record in this case, we conclude that the error in refusing to admit Dr. Nelson\u2019s testimony on the issue of self-defense was not harmless error as to the jury\u2019s finding of guilt. Peeples testified that he knew Hicks had a violent reputation. Peeples saw Harvey reaching for what Peeples believed was a gun. Peeples believed he was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>being robbed and feared he might be shot. Peeples testified that he started shooting because he \u201cpanicked.\u201d Although the record contains evidence that clearly contradicts Peeples\u2019s claim of self-defense, \u201c[o]ther evidence of a disputed fact standing alone, does not establish that an error is harmless.\u201d <em>Hooker v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 454, 458, 418 S.E.2d 343, 345 (1992). A harmless error analysis is not simply a sufficiency of the evidence analysis. <em>See id. </em>Even if \u201cthe other evidence amply supports the jury\u2019s verdicts, [error is not harmless when] the disputed testimony may well have affected the jury\u2019s decision.\u201d <em>Cartera v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 516, 519, 248 S.E.2d 784, 786 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b416-5\">We cannot say that if the jury believed Peeples\u2019s version of the events and had before it the erroneously excluded evidence, it would have reached the same verdict. We also cannot say that the only reasonable conclusion to be drawn from this evidence was that when Peeples shot Hicks, Peeples did not act in self-defense. Because this excluded evidence clearly tended to support Peeples\u2019s claim of self-defense, it does not \u201cplainly appear\u201d that the proffered evidence would not have affected the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the trial judge erred in refusing to allow Peeples to introduce psychological testimony regarding his mental condition for the purpose of establishing whether he acted in self-defense.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Accordingly, we reverse the judgment and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b416-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b411-6\">.

Contrary to the Commonwealth\u2019s argument, the record does not indicate that Dr. Nelson\u2019s testimony would have directly addressed the \"ultimate issue\u201d of whether Peeples was reasonably afraid of death or serious bodily harm at the time of the shooting. Instead, Dr. Nelson\u2019s testimony was limited to testimony about Peeples\u2019s general mental characteristics and was merely probative of the ultimate issue of the subjective reasonableness of Peeples\u2019s fear. As such, this case is distinguishable from <em>Zelenak v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 295, 300, 487 S.E.2d 873, 875 (1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b414-7\">. <em>See Stamper, </em>228 Va. at 717, 324 S.E.2d at 688 (\"we hold that evidence of a criminal defendant's mental state at the time of the offense is, in the absence of an insanity defense, irrelevant to the issue of guilt\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b416-11\">.

Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 295, 487 S.E.2d 873 (1997) <em>(en </em>banc), controls this case. In <em>Zelenak, </em>the defense was duress, and the issue was whether the threat to the defendant \u201ccaused her reasonably to believe that per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>forming the criminal conduct was her only reasonable opportunity to avoid imminent death or serious bodily harm.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 300, 487 S.E.2d at 875. This Court, sitting <em>en banc, </em>held that the trial court properly excluded expert psychological opinion because it was an opinion on the ultimate issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-5\">In this case, the defense is self-defense, and the issue is whether the defendant \u201creasonably feared death or serious bodily injury at the time of the shooting.\u201d However, the majority holds that the trial court improperly excluded expert psychological opinion because it was not an opinion on the ultimate issue. The majority dismisses <em>Zelenak </em>in a footnote and adopts the reasoning of the dissent. I do not believe that precedent can be dismissed so simply. In <em>Zelenak </em>the defense was duress; in this case the defense was self-defense. In both, the mental element necessary to establish the defense was the subjectively reasonable fear of the defendant. If psychological opinion was not permissible in one, it cannot be permissible in the other.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-6\">The majority disregards the clear holding of <em>Stamper v. Commonwealth, </em>228 Va. 707, 324 S.E.2d 682 (1985). That case held as follows: \u201cwe hold that evidence of a criminal defendant\u2019s mental state at the time of the offense is, in the absence of an insanity defense, irrelevant to the issue of guilt.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 717, 324 S.E.2d at 688. The Court refused to adopt a diminished capacity theory of criminal responsibility. Further, the Court interpreted the evidence as an attempt to introduce expert opinion on the ultimate fact. In its conclusion, the Court stated the fundamental reason for such exclusion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b417-7\">The state of knowledge in the fields of medicine and psychiatry is subject to constant advance and change. The classifications and gradations applied to mental illnesses, disorders, and defects are frequently revised. The courts cannot, and should not, become dependent upon these subtle and shifting gradations for the resolution of each specific case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b417-8\"><em>Stamper, </em>228 Va. at 716, 324 S.E.2d at 688.</p>\n<p id=\"b417-9\"><em>Stamper </em>is controlling precedent. It was neither limited nor refined by <em>Smith v. Commonwealth, </em>239 Va. 243, 259-60, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>389 S.E.2d 871, 879-80, <em>cert. denied, </em>498 U.S. 881, 111 S.Ct. 221, 112 L.Ed.2d 177 (1990), as the majority suggests. Rather, it was followed with approval in all respects as it has been in later cases. <em>See Jenkins v. Commonwealth, </em>244 Va. 445, 456, 423 S.E.2d 360, 367-68 (1992), <em>cert. denied, </em>507 U.S. 1036, 113 S.Ct. 1862, 123 L.Ed.2d 483 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b418-5\">I believe the trial court correctly excluded this opinion evidence based on the direct precedent of <em>Zelenak </em>and the controlling rationale of <em>Stamper. </em>I would affirm the convictions.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
