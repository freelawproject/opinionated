On appeal, he contends the trial court erred in failing to suppress a barment notice issued under a policy authorizing police officers to act as agents for the manager of a public housing complex. For the following reasons, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-14\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-15\">In June 1995, the management of Loudoun House, a federally-subsidized apartment complex, devised a strategy to curb criminal activity and trespassing. The property manager <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>executed a power of attorney appointing as her agents all members of the Leesburg Police Department and granting them the power to issue barment notices to unauthorized individuals present on the Loudoun House property. The power of attorney designated \u201ceach and every sworn officer of the Leesburg Police Department as my true and lawful attorneys-in-fact.\u201d The attorneys were authorized to act for the property management agency as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-5\">(1) To serve trespass notices to any persons encountered on Loudoun House property who are not on a lease and cannot demonstrate a legitimate purpose for being on the premises. The trespass notice shall forbid the person served with it from returning to the property of Loudoun House.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-6\">(2) To file criminal complaints for trespass on Loudoun House property if persons served with trespass notices return to the premises.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-7\">(3) To testify on behalf of the management of Loudoun House in any criminal prosecutions arising out of the trespass notices and complaints described above that the officers are the \u201cattorneys-in-fact\u201d of the National Housing Property Management Company, and as such are authorized to issue barment notices.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">On June 5, 1996, Captain Christopher Jones, using the power of attorney, issued appellant a barment notice signed by the Loudoun House management. The notice stated that the management had given the police permission to issue the barment, that appellant was being notified that he was not permitted to be present on the Loudoun House property \u201cunder any circumstances,\u201d and that if he returned to the property he was subject to arrest for trespassing. Appellant signed the notice indicating he understood what it meant.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">On September 28,1996, Officer Mike Buracker was conducting a plainclothes patrol of the Loudoun House apartment complex when he was advised that appellant was present on the premises in the area of building twelve. The officer went to that location and saw appellant leaving building twelve with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number>an open beer in his hand. Buracker knew appellant was listed on a police print-out of persons who had been barred from the property and arrested him for trespassing in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-119.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b114-5\">Appellant filed a motion to suppress the power of attorney and barment evidence. The trial court denied the motion, convicted appellant of trespassing, and imposed a fine of $1,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-6\">On April 1, 1997, subsequent to appellant\u2019s trial, the Lees-burg Town Council adopted a resolution supporting the issuance of barment notices using the limited power of attorney. The resolution stated that \u201cthe issuance of barment notices by the town police in this manner has been a successful procedure in discouraging criminal and drug related activity.\u201d The council ratified the procedure and authorized it \u201cto be utilized by the town police to ensure the health, safety and welfare of all citizens of the Town.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">Appellant contends the duties enumerated in the power of attorney exceeded the scope of legitimate police authority and thus the power of attorney had no effect. He argues that as a result the Commonwealth failed to establish that Captain Jones had the authority to issue the barment notice and therefore failed to prove that appellant had effective notice that he was barred from the property as required by Code \u00a7 18.2-119.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-9\">The question of whether a police officer may act as an -agent for a property owner, lessee, custodian or other person lawfully in charge of property for the purpose of issuing barment notices to people who \u201care unable to demonstrate a legitimate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>reason for being on the property\u201d is an issue of first impression in Virginia. Additionally, the General Assembly has not addressed this question, and no Virginia statute expressly authorizes or prohibits this practice.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">A review of the law of our sister states reveals that no other state has considered this precise question. However, several jurisdictions have approved similar or related practices to combat the problem of criminal and drug-related activities of non-residents in public housing. <em>See Daniel v. City of Tampa, </em>38 F.3d 546 (11th Cir.1994) (police enforcement of \u201ctrespass after warning\u201d statute upheld against constitutional challenge by leafleteer); <em>Daniel v. City of Tampa, </em>818 F.Supp. 1491, 1492 (M.D.Fla.1993) (public housing complexes \u201chave a serious problem with drugs and other crimes ... caused by people who do not live in the public housing areas\u201d); <em>L.D.L. v. State, </em>569 So.2d 1310 (Fla.Dist.Ct.App.1990) (acknowledging police authority to issue \u201cno trespass\u201d warnings to unauthorized individuals on public housing complex property); <em>Williams v. Nagel, </em>162 Ill.2d 542, 205 Ill.Dec. 525, 643 N.E.2d 816 (1994), <em>cert. denied, </em>514 U.S. 1064, 115 S.Ct. 1694, 131 L.Ed.2d 558 (1995) (police issued \u201cbarred notices\u201d and gave names of those barred to public housing management who determined whether to place them on the \u201cno trespass\u201d list of people to be arrested for trespassing if they returned to the property); <em>People v. Kojac, </em>176 Misc.2d 187, 671 N.Y.S.2d 949, - N.E.2d - (N.Y.Sup.1998) (describing \u201ctrespass affidavit building\u201d in which building management authorized police to arrest anyone who entered without a legitimate reason); <em>State v. Newell, </em>93 Ohio App.3d 609, 639 N.E.2d 513 (1994) (noting off-duty police officers acted as agents for public housing authority in issuing trespassing warnings); <em>City of Dayton v. Williams, </em>No. 13686, 1994 WL 37263 (Ohio Ct.App. Feb. 11, 1994) (describing public housing authority policy whereby police officers issue trespass notices to unauthorized individuals on the property and arrest those who previously received warnings).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">In <em>Daniel v. City of Tampa, </em>38 F.3d 546 (11th Cir.1994), the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals tacitly approved a proce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>dure that closely resembled the one at issue in the instant case. The public housing property in Tampa, under the control <em>of the </em>Housing Authority, was \u201coften used by nonresidents as a place to sell and use drugs.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 548. As a result, the Housing Authority limited property access to \u201cresidents, invited guests of residents, and those conducting official business.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cEnforcement of this limited access policy [was] accomplished through enforcement of Florida\u2019s trespass after warning statute.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Under \u201ca special agency agreement,\u201d the Housing Authority authorized the Tampa Police Department \u201cto issue warnings to persons trespassing upon Housing Authority property. Once an individual is issued a trespass warning, he is placed on a list and is subject to arrest if found on Housing Authority property again.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">After reviewing the procedure, the court found \u201cthe Tampa police have virtually no discretion when enforcing the statute on the Housing Authority property: any person who is not a lawful resident of the property, an invited guest, or present on official business, is subject to arrest after receiving a warning.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 551. The court upheld the \u201ctrespass after warning\u201d statute against vagueness and freedom of speech challenges, holding that \u201cenforcement of Florida\u2019s trespass after warning statute on the property is a reasonable means of combatting drug and crime problems on the property.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although the defendant in <em>Daniel </em>did not directly challenge the authority of the police to issue warnings on behalf of the property management, the court\u2019s acceptance of the policy as \u201creasonable\u201d is noteworthy.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">In Virginia, the Dillon Rule of strict construction dictates our determination of the powers of local governing bodies and of the city police as the law enforcement arm of the local government. This rule provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b116-7\">\u201c[A] municipal corporation possesses and can exercise the following powers, and no others: First, those granted in express words; Second, those necessarily or fairly implied in or incident to the powers expressly granted; Third, those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number>essential to the declared objects and purposes of the corporation, not simply convenient, but indispensable.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AdX\"><em>Commonwealth v. Rivera, </em>18 Va.App. 103, 108, 442 S.E.2d 410, 413 (1994) (quoting <em>City of Winchester v. Redmond, </em>93 Va. 711, 714, 25 S.E. 1001, 1002 (1896)). \u2018\u201cThe Dillon Rule is applicable to determine in the first instance, from express words or by implication, whether a power exists at all. If the power cannot be found, the inquiry is at an end.\u2019 \u201d <em>Lawless v. County of Chesterfield, </em>21 Va.App. 495, 499, 465 S.E.2d 153, 155 (1995) (quoting <em>Commonwealth v. County Bd. of Arlington County, </em>217 Va. 558, 575, 232 S.E.2d 30, 41 (1977)).</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">Under Code \u00a7 15.1-839, a municipal corporation has general powers to promote the welfare of the people.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although the Leesburg Town Council ratified the barment process at issue, appellant\u2019s arrest and conviction pre-dated the town\u2019s resolution.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> At the time of appellant\u2019s arrest, police officers were acting at the request of the property manager for ongoing police assistance in prevention of crime in a public housing complex. To facilitate this assistance, the Loudoun House management conferred on the police authority to bar unauthorized individuals from the property. Therefore, we must <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"74\">*74</page-number>address whether the police compliance with the property manager\u2019s request and their acceptance of this authority were within the scope of power granted to police or necessarily implied in Code \u00a7 15.1-138.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">Code \u00a7 15.1-138, the statute in effect at the time of appellant\u2019s arrest,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> expressly granted police officers the following powers:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b118-6\">The officers and privates constituting the police force of counties, cities and towns of the Commonwealth are hereby invested with all the power and authority which formerly belonged to the office of constable at common law in taking cognizance of, and in enforcing the criminal laws of the Commonwealth and the ordinances and regulations of the county, city or town, respectively, for which they are appointed or elected. Each policeman shall endeavor to prevent the commission within the county, city or town of offenses against the law of the Commonwealth and against the ordinances and regulations of the county, city or town; shall observe and enforce all such laws, ordinances and regulations; shall detect and arrest offenders against the same; shall preserve the good order of the county, city or town; and shall secure the inhabitants thereof from violence and the property therein from injury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b118-7\">The plain language of the statute granted police officers the power to prevent and detect erime, to arrest criminals, and to protect life and property. Because Code \u00a7 15.1-138 did not explicitly address police authority to issue barment notices, under a Dillon Rule analysis, we must determine whether this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"75\">*75</page-number>power was \u201cnecessarily or fairly implied in or incident to\u201d the powers expressly granted by the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">\u201cWe look to the purpose and objective of [Code \u00a7 15.1-138] in considering whether this authority necessarily is implied from the powers expressly granted by the statute.\u201d <em>City of Chesapeake v. Gardner Enters., Inc., </em>253 Va. 243, 247, 482 S.E.2d 812, 815 (1997). \u201cThe statute must be given a rational interpretation consistent with its purposes, and not one which will substantially defeat its objectives.\u201d <em>Id. </em>One of the objectives of Code \u00a7 15.1-138 is the detection and prevention of illegal activities, including drug-related crimes. Police officers are also empowered to arrest criminals and are charged with the responsibility of protecting life and property. Necessarily implied in these duties is the power of the police to respond to requests for assistance from private citizens.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-6\">It is undisputed that the police had the power to accept the property manager\u2019s authority to bar a specified individual from the property. This power furthered the objectives of the police to prevent crime, to protect life and property, and to preserve the peace, and it was necessarily implied in the powers expressly granted to police by Code \u00a7 15.1-138.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-7\">In the instant barment procedure, the request for assistance, as well as the police response, was ongoing. Rather than respond to separate requests for service of a barment notice upon each unauthorized individual, the property manager\u2019s limited power of attorney empowered police to bar any unauthorized individual from the property. This practice allowed police to identify and remove individuals who were on the property without legitimate purpose, thus preventing crime, protecting property, and preserving the peace.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the limited authority to grant barment notices was a necessary and expedient means of crime prevention and was \u201cfairly implied in or incident to the powers expressly granted\u201d to police by Code \u00a7 15.1-138. Consequently, the officers did not act outside their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"76\">*76</page-number>statutory authority by issuing a notice barring appellant from Loudoun House, and the conviction is affirmed.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b120-5\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b114-10\">. \"If any person without authority of law goes upon or remains upon the lands, buildings or premises of another, or any portion or area thereof, after having been forbidden to do so, either orally or in writing, by the owner, lessee, custodian or other person lawfully in charge thereof ... he shall be guilty of a Class 1 misdemeanor.\u201d Code \u00a7 18.2-119.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b117-6\">. \"A municipal corporation shall have and may exercise all powers which it now has or which may hereafter be conferred upon or delegated to it under the Constitution and laws of the Commonwealth and all other powers pertinent to the conduct of the affairs and functions of the municipal government, the exercise of which is not expressly prohibited by the Constitution and the general laws of the Commonwealth, and which are necessary or desirable to secure and promote the general welfare of the inhabitants of the municipality and the safety, health, peace, good order, comfort, convenience, morals, trade, commerce and industry of the municipality and the inhabitants thereof, and the enumeration of specific powers shall not be construed or held to be exclusive or as a limitation upon any general grant of power, but shall be construed and held to be in addition to any general grant of power.\u201d Code \u00a7 15.1-839 (superseded by Code \u00a7 15.2-1102, effective December 1, 1997).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b117-7\">.

This contention misinterprets the statute. Although barment, a private action grounded in the law of property rights, is a civil matter, <em>see Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>246 (6th ed.1990) (defining civil laws as \"concerned with ... private rights and remedies\u201d), Code \u00a7 15.1-138 does not prohibit private grants of authority over civil matters, and it is the validity of such a grant of power that is in question here.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
