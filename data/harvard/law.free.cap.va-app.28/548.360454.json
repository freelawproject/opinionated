On appeal, the Commonwealth contends the trial judge erred in granting Benjamin\u2019s pretrial motion to suppress a statement Benjamin made during a police interrogation. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-398. Benjamin cross-appeals two issues <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>the trial judge decided adversely to him. For the reasons that follow, we affirm the trial judge\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-6\">The evidence at the suppression hearing proved that on the night of November 14, 1997, the police received information that a person known as \u201cSha\u201d had been involved in a double homicide in Chesterfield County. The police also learned that Sha lived in an apartment \u201coff of Hull Street\u201d and had driven a stolen Nissan automobile. When the police arrived at the apartment complex early on November 15, 1997, they saw the stolen automobile.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-7\">Several police officers set up surveillance around the automobile. Sergeant Smith told Detective Ivey to detain anyone who entered the car. He specifically advised Detective Ivey to be on the lookout for a suspect named Sha, who was believed to be a fifteen to eighteen-year-old male. Detective Ivey later learned that Sha lived in one of the apartments in the building at 1408 Clarkson Road. He understood that Sha was somehow involved in a homicide but did not know the nature of Sha\u2019s involvement or whether a firearm was involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b594-8\">Detective Hensley, who was part of the surveillance team, was informed that the automobile had been involved in a double homicide, that it possibly was driven and occupied by four males involved in the homicides, and that a high-caliber semiautomatic rifle had been used in the incident. He testified that the officers had been told to look for Rosheen Waller, who was known by the name \u201cShaw.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b594-9\">At 9:30 a.m., a person entered the automobile and attempted to drive off. Because of a spiking device the officers placed on a tire, the tire flattened. However, before the officers could respond, the person exited the automobile and walked around the apartment building in the direction of apartment 1408 A. The officers were unable to identify the person but they proceeded to apartment 1408 A.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>When the officers arrived at the apartment, they knocked at the door, believing Waller resided there. Benjamin\u2019s mother responded to the knock on the door. Seeing Benjamin in the apartment, Detective Hensley asked him to identify himself. Benjamin said he was \u201cShamaal Benjamin.\u201d The officers told Benjamin they were looking for \u201cRosheen Waller, going by the nickname Shaw.\u201d When Benjamin told them Waller lived elsewhere, the officers left Benjamin\u2019s residence to search for Waller.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-5\">As the officers looked throughout the apartment complex, Christopher Thomas entered the stolen automobile. Detective Ivey and other officers detained Thomas and asked if his name was Sha. Thomas denied being Sha, said Sha had just walked past them to apartment 1408 A, and told the officers they could verify Thomas\u2019s identity by asking his cousin in apartment 1408 B. Thomas\u2019s cousin confirmed his identity.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-6\">Detective Ivey and several officers returned to apartment 1408 A and told Benjamin\u2019s mother they were looking for her son. Detective Ivey testified that when Benjamin\u2019s mother opened the door, he and another officer breached the doorway, stepped over the threshold of the front door, and asked to speak to her son. Detective Ivey saw Benjamin in the room and told Benjamin to come with him. When the officers took Benjamin outside, Thomas pointed to Benjamin and said, \u201cThat\u2019s Shaw.\u201d Detective Ivey then placed handcuffs on Benjamin.</p>\n<p id=\"b595-7\">Detectives Carroll and Church interrogated Benjamin at the Chesterfield Police headquarters. By stipulation, a videotape of the custodial interrogation was entered into evidence at the suppression hearing. The trial judge watched the videotape as Detective Church testified concerning his reading of the <em>Miranda </em>form and the interrogation of Benjamin. Detective Church testified that Benjamin\u2019s facial expressions, body language, and tone of voice never indicated to him that Benjamin did not understand everything that occurred during the interrogation. Benjamin confessed his involvement in the shooting incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>In granting Benjamin\u2019s motion to suppress his statement, the trial judge made extensive findings. With regard to Benjamin\u2019s Fourth Amendment claim, the trial judge found that the officers\u2019 initial seizure of Benjamin in his apartment was a warrantless arrest. He also found that sufficient probable cause for the arrest \u201cwas developed just prior and contemporaneously\u201d to the seizure. However, the trial judge found that the officers did not have consent to enter Benjamin\u2019s residence and that no exigent circumstances justified the warrantless entry. Thus, the judge found that Benjamin\u2019s arrest was unlawful and constituted an illegal seizure in violation of the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-5\">With regard to Benjamin\u2019s Fifth Amendment claim, the trial judge found \u201cas a matter of fact that the <em>Miranda </em>[rights advisal] ... was done ... in an unintelligible manner.\u201d Although the trial judge found that Benjamin\u2019s statement was not a product of any police coercion, intimidation, threats, or promise of leniency, he found that Benjamin did not verbally acknowledge any understanding of the <em>Miranda </em>rights and that Benjamin did not waive his Fifth Amendment rights. He found that \u201cany waiver of rights was not given freely, intelligently and voluntarily with full knowledge of the meaning and effect of the waiver that was being solicited.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b596-6\">As to Benjamin\u2019s Sixth Amendment claim, the trial judge found that Benjamin\u2019s request for counsel, \u201cif it was made,\u201d was unintelligible and ambiguous.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b596-8\">Our review of the trial judge\u2019s ruling on the motion to suppress is governed by the following standards:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b596-9\">[T]he burden is on the appellant to show that the trial court\u2019s decision constituted reversible error. We view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. We review the trial court\u2019s findings of historical fact only for \u201cclear error,\u201d but we review <em>de novo </em>the trial court\u2019s application of defined legal standards to the particu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>lar facts of a case, such as determinations of reasonable suspicion and probable cause. Whether a defendant \u201cinvoked\u201d his <em>Miranda </em>right[s] ... during custodial interrogation and whether he \u201cwaived\u201d [these] ... right[s] are determined by applying judicially declared standards.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-5\"><em>Quinn v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 702, 712-13, 492 S.E.2d 470, 475-76 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">Evidence in the record clearly supports the trial judge\u2019s finding that Detective Church\u2019s reading of the <em>Miranda </em>rights form to Benjamin was unintelligible. The videotape of the interrogation was stipulated to be evidence. The detective\u2019s reading of the statement was so jumbled and unintelligible that the trial judge remarked, \u201cIs he speaking in tongues?\u201d Significantly, only when the detective is reading from the form is his diction unintelligible. The videotape demonstrates that the detective\u2019s other statements and questions to Benjamin, both before and after the unintelligible reading from the form, are clear and understandable. Upon review of the evidence, we hold that the trial judge\u2019s factual findings concerning the <em>Miranda </em>rights are not plainly wrong. Indeed, those findings are clearly supported by the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-7\">\u201c[A]n individual held for interrogation must be clearly informed [of the <em>Miranda </em>rights].\u201d <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 471, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b597-8\">\u201c[T]he prosecution may not use statements, whether exculpatory or inculpatory, stemming from custodial interrogation of the defendant unless it demonstrates the use of procedural safeguards effective to secure the privilege against self-incrimination,\u201d commonly known as <em>Miranda </em>warnings. \u201cFailure to give <em>Miranda </em>warnings prior to custodial interrogation requires suppression of any illegally obtained statements.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b597-9\"><em>Timbers v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 187, 194, 503 S.E.2d 233, 236 (1998) (citations omitted). The manner in which the detective read the statement to Benjamin was so unintelligible that it was functionally equivalent to not reading to Benjamin the <em>Miranda </em>rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>Furthermore, based on the evidence in the record, the trial judge did not err in ruling that the Commonwealth did not meet its \u201cburden of proving that the defendant knowingly [, voluntarily,] and intelligently waived the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination and the right to counsel.\u201d <em>Goodwin v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 249, 252, 349 S.E.2d 161, 163 (1986). The record establishes that after the detective read unintelligibly from the form, he showed Benjamin a form which asked, \u201cDo you understand the rights that have been explained to you?\u201d The detective then told Benjamin to write \u201cYes\u201d if he read and understood English. The trial judge noted the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-5\">Now, he says to the young man, he says to him on the tape, he said, \u201cdo you read and understand English?\u201d And then he says, \u201cWrite \u201cyes\u201d there.\u201d____</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-6\">It doesn\u2019t tell him he\u2019s waiving his rights. He says, \u201cSign yes here.\u201d It says that I\u2019ve read to you these rights, doesn\u2019t say that you understand these rights, it says that you understand and read English. That\u2019s not what the form says.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b598-7\">I find nowhere during the course of this taping that there was an active waiver, assuming that what he did was a fuH and complete rights advisal. Where did he waive those rights, by signing this?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b598-8\">Upon our review of the evidence and the facts as found by the trial judge, we hold that the Commonwealth failed to bear its burden of proving Benjamin made a knowing, voluntary, and intelligent waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b598-9\">In view of our holding, which affirms the trial judge\u2019s order suppressing the statement as a violation of Benjamin\u2019s Fifth Amendment rights, we need not address the Commonwealth\u2019s further contention that the trial judge erroneously based the suppression order on the additional grounds that Benjamin was unlawfully arrested in his home without a warrant and without exigent circumstances to justify the entry. For the same reason, we need not address Benjamin\u2019s contentions that he clearly invoked his right to counsel during the interrogation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>and that the trial judge erred in finding that the police had probable cause to arrest him.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-5\">For these reasons, we affirm the trial judge\u2019s order suppressing the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b599-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
