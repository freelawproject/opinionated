Smith appeals the final order of the circuit court upholding the decision of the Department of Mines, Minerals and Energy denying him replacement of lost residential water supplies. Because the trial court committed no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-5\">Link M. Smith owns approximately 324 acres of land in Bandy, Virginia, most of which is located above an underground coal mine operated by G &amp; A Coal Company (G &amp; A) pursuant to a permit it acquired in 1984. Smith has a residential water well located on his property which he claims has been adversely affected by the operation of the mine.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-6\">Smith has filed four complaints with the Division of Mined Land Reclamation (DMLR), a branch of the Department of Mines, Minerals and Energy (DMME). In 1987, his first complaint alleged that his water supply was diminished in the well, forcing him to replace it. In 1990, he complained of water loss to his replacement well. In 1991, Smith complained about the diminished water supply and the reopening of ground cracks on his property. In 1993, Smith alleged that he first became aware of pollution and deterioration of the replacement well. His fourth complaint, filed on August 10, 1993, alleges loss of residential water supply. The fourth complaint is the subject of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b724-7\">In 1992, the United States Congress passed the Energy Policy Act of 1992. This Act mandates that companies operating underground coal mines replace residential water supplies that were polluted or lost as a result of mining activity. <em>See </em>30 U.S.C. \u00a7 1309(a)(2). This provision applies to any loss that results from underground mining after October 24, 1992. <em>Id. </em>In July 1993, the General Assembly of Virginia amended the Virginia Coal Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1979 (VCSMCRA) to similarly require the replacement of lost residential water supplies. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 45.1-258(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b724-8\">On June 28, 1994, the DMLR issued Technical Report # 1562 in response to Smith\u2019s fourth complaint. The report concluded that Smith\u2019s water loss complaint in 1993 resulted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"681\">*681</page-number>from mining activities conducted prior to October 24, 1992. Finding that Code \u00a7 45.1-258(B) requires the replacement of water loss only by underground mining activity conducted after October 24, 1992, the DMLR concluded that it could not order G &amp; A to replace Smith\u2019s lost water.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-4\">On November 30, 1994, an administrative hearing was held on Smith\u2019s complaint. The hearing officer granted G &amp; A\u2019s petition to intervene as a party. On March 15, 1995, the hearing officer issued an opinion finding that because of the location of the first well, \u201cit is unlikely that underground mining activity by G &amp; A Coal Co., Inc. has contributed to [Smith\u2019s] water losses.\u201d Further, with respect to the second well, the opinion stated \u201csince the mining activities that resulted in these losses of water [predated] October 24, 1992, the [DMLR] cannot require replacement of the supply.\u201d On March 17, 1995, the hearing officer\u2019s opinion was adopted by the Deputy Director for Regulatory Services for the DMME. In the same letter, the Deputy Director affirmed the hearing officer\u2019s opinion and adopted the hearing officer\u2019s \u201cFindings of Fact\u201d and \u201cConclusions of Law.\u201d By letter dated May 4, 1995, the DMME denied Smith\u2019s request for reconsideration and review.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-5\">On May 26, 1995, Smith filed a Notice of Appeal with the Circuit Court of Tazewell County. Smith received a letter, dated May 31, 1995, from the Hearings Coordinator of the DMLR, listing the contents of the administrative record, including the \u201cFormal Hearing Transcript and exhibits (11/30/94).\u201d On December 23, 1996, the circuit court heard argument from Smith and DMLR, as parties, and G &amp; A, as intervenor. By order dated November 6, 1997, the court found substantial evidence in the record to support the DMLR\u2019s decision and dismissed Smith\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b725-6\">After the entry of the final order, Smith alleges that he discovered that the DMLR had omitted all hearing exhibits from the transcript filed with the circuit court. On November 13, 1997, Smith filed a \u201cMotion for Reconsideration of Judgment.\u201d On December 1, 1997, Smith filed a \u201cMotion for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"682\">*682</page-number>Reconsideration of Judgment and for Order Requiring Completion of Record by Agency.\u201d By order dated January 9, 1998, upon Smith\u2019s <em>ore terms </em>motion to withdraw the \u201cMotion for Reconsideration of Judgment\u201d and the concurrence of the DMLR and G &amp; A, the court ordered the November 13 motion stricken from the record and denied Smith\u2019s December 1 motion requesting that the allegedly missing exhibits be filed as a part of the record, stating: \u201c[f]inding the record complete ... any possible objection to the completeness of the record is too late.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b726-4\">\n<em>THE RECORD</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b726-5\">The provisions of the Virginia Coal Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act, Code \u00a7 45.1-226 <em>et seq., </em>mandate review procedures conducted by formal administrative hearings. In addition, the Act makes provisions for parties seeking judicial review of administrative decisions, and makes all participating entities subject to the provisions of the Virginia Administrative Process Act (APA) (Code \u00a7 9-6.14:1 <em>et seq.). </em>Code \u00a7 45.1-251.</p>\n<p id=\"b726-6\">Part Two A of the Rules of the Supreme Court of Virginia prescribes appeals pursuant to the Administrative Process Act. The Rules state:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-7\">The agency secretary shall prepare and certify the record as soon as possible after the notice of appeal and transcript or statement of testimony is filed and shall, as soon as it has been certified by him, transmit the record to the clerk of the court named in the notice of appeal____ The agency secretary shall notify all parties in writing when the record is transmitted, naming the court to which it is transmitted____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b726-9\">Rule 2A:3(b).</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b726-10\">The record on appeal from an agency proceeding shall consist of all notices of appeal, any application or petition, all orders or regulations promulgated in the proceeding by the agency, the opinions, the transcript or statement of the testimony filed by appellant, and all exhibits accepted or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"683\">*683</page-number>rejected, together with such other material as may be certified by the agency secretary to be a part of the record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0a\">Rule 2A:3(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">At the hearing before the hearing officer held on November 30, 1994, Smith introduced several exhibits. Smith alleges that these exhibits were not contained in the record received by the circuit court. Smith argues that whether it was a mere oversight, or an intentional exclusion, the agency\u2019s failure to include the exhibits in the administrative record constituted a failure to comply with its duty under Rule 2A:3(b). The agency argues that the record received by the circuit court included the exhibits and cites the circuit court\u2019s hearing transcript, the court\u2019s failure to indicate a lack of familiarity with the referenced exhibits during the hearing, and the explicit statement in its order that it considered the \u201cexhibits in the administrative record\u201d dismissing Smith\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">By order dated November 6, 1997, the court found substantial evidence to support the DMLR\u2019s decision, and dismissed Smith\u2019s appeal. On November 13, 1997, Smith filed a \u201cMotion for Reconsideration of Judgment.\u201d On December 1, 1997, Smith filed a \u201cMotion for Reconsideration of Judgment and for Order Requiring Completion of Record by Agency.\u201d On December 3, 1997, a telephone conference was held during which Smith\u2019s counsel moved to withdraw his November 13 motion on the grounds that pursuant to Rule 1.1, the court no longer had jurisdiction to vacate, modify, or otherwise reconsider the verdict. Neither counsel for DMLR nor G &amp; A had any objection. The court granted the motion and then considered Smith\u2019s December 1 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-7\">Without specific citation to any particular rule, Smith maintains in his December 1 motion that the Rules of the Supreme Court require the DMLR, after 21 days from the entry of the final order, to file the allegedly missing documents with the trial court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Any objection to the status of the record was not timely and will not be considered on appeal. Rule 5A:18.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>It is the agency\u2019s responsibility to prepare and certify the record to the circuit court. See Rule 2A:3(b),(c). Assuming without deciding that the circuit court did not have a complete record before it during the hearing, any objection by Smith was too late for the trial court to correct the problem and, consequently, inadequate to preserve the issue for appeal. Had it been established in a timely manner that the entire record required By Rule 2A:3(b),(c) was not before the court, failure to grant Smith\u2019s motion for reconsideration of the trial court\u2019s ruling would have been an abuse of discretion. The filing of the November 13, 1997 motion was within the time the court could act to correct the problem. Rule 1:1. But the matter was not placed on the docket and brought to the court\u2019s attention so it could consider the merits of the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-4\">\u201c[I]t is well established that the purpose of Rule 5A:18 is to require a party to raise an issue in a timely fashion before the trial judge so the court has opportunity to address the issue and prevent unnecessary appeals.\u201d <em>White v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 710, 720, 467 S.E.2d 297, 302 (1996). Here, the matter was not placed before the judge in a timely manner, giving the court the opportunity to address the merits of the issue. To compound the omission, the November 13, 1997 motion was withdrawn by Smith, thereby removing it from consideration by the trial court. Smith\u2019s December 1, 1997 motion was filed more than 21 days after the final order was entered. The court had no power to entertain that motion. Consequently, the issue of the completeness of the record before the trial judge was not preserved for appeal. Rule 5A:18.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-5\">\n<em>SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"ALS\">In reviewing an agency decision, \u201c[t]he scope of court review of a litigated issue under the APA is limited to determination [of] whether there was substantial evidence in the agency record to support the decision.\u201d <em>State Board of </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"685\">*685</page-number><em>Health v. Godfrey, </em>223 Va. 423, 433, 290 S.E.2d 875, 880 (1982); <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 9-6.14:17. The substantial evidence standard is \u201cdesigned to give great stability and finality to the fact-findings of an administrative agency.\u201d <em>Virginia Real Estate Comm\u2019n v. Bias, </em>226 Va. 264, 269, 308 S.E.2d 123, 125 (1983) . A trial court may reject the findings of fact \u201conly if, considering the record as a whole, a reasonable mind would <em>necessarily </em>come to a different conclusion.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing B. Mezines, <em>Administrative Law </em>\u00a7 51.01 (1981)). The burden of proof rests upon the party challenging the agency determination to show that there was not substantial evidence in the record to support it. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 9-6.14:17.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-6\">The circuit court found substantial evidence in the record for the DMME to uphold the hearing officer\u2019s findings that Smith\u2019s water losses were either unrelated to G &amp; A\u2019s mining activities, or that the mining activities which caused the loss took place prior to October 24, 1992. Smith argues that the hearing officer\u2019s conclusions were not supported by substantial evidence and that pursuant to Code \u00a7 45.1-258, he is entitled to have his water loss replaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b729-7\">At the hearing before the hearing officer, the DMLR introduced Technical Report (TR) # 1562 that had been issued by the DMLR following the filing of Smith\u2019s fourth complaint. The report analyzed information provided by Smith, as well as \u201cseveral previous DMLR Technical Reports ... DMLR permit data, company mine maps, and Division of Mines\u2019 maps....\u201d The Report determined,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-9\">[i]t is likely that underground mining by G &amp; A ... caused some damage to some local water-bearing zones.... However, <em>the water loss complaint regarding [the] Smith [property] is </em>unsubstantiated.... Also, [Smith\u2019s] domestic well is located approximately 600 feet updip from the mine works, outside the area of influence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b729-12\">(Emphasis added). The Report stated further,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b729-13\">[t]he proximity of mining, in terms of distance and time, is critical in determining the effects of underground mining. The [area] being deep mined by G &amp; A ... in the area of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>the complaint ... was conducted closest to the well in 1988 and the nearest pillar extraction in 1989. Since that time mining operations have continued away from the complainant\u2019s residence____ <em>Because of the location of [Smith\u2019s] well </em>... <em>it is unlikely that his well and associated water-bearing zones have been impacted.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b730-5\">(Emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b730-6\">The Report concluded, \u201c[b]ased on the information examined during the technical investigation, it is unlikely that underground mining by [G <em>&amp; </em>A] has contributed to water losses in [other springs,] [h]owever, since the mining activities that resulted in these losses of water occurred before October 24, 1992, the [DMLR] cannot require replacement of the supply.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b730-7\">Other evidence included testimony by Jan Zentmeyer and Anthony S. Scales, both geologists employed with the DMME. Zentmeyer testified that she had investigated Smith\u2019s earlier complaints and that she had determined that wells and springs which Smith complained had been affected by G &amp; A\u2019s mining operations were too far away to have been impacted. Scales testified that although he had not written TR # 1562, he was familiar with Smith\u2019s case and the technical reports related to it. Scales testified that Smith\u2019s reliance on another case was misplaced.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b730-8\">On behalf of the appellant, geologist Charles Barlett testified that water loss suffered by Smith was due to mining that took place after October 24,1992. In evaluating the testimony of the experts, the hearing officer resolved the conflict in favor of Scales\u2019 testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"687\">*687</page-number>The hearing officer stated, \u201c[t]he division\u2019s conclusion that G &amp; A\u2019s mining did not cause material damage to the hydrological balance outside the permit area is valid.... The evidence at the hearing supported the view that there was not continuous fracture flow zone.\u201d In evaluating all evidence introduced at the hearing, the hearing officer determined, \u201c[tjhere has been no significant adverse impact on the hydrological balance in the area in question.\u201d The hearing officer concluded further that Smith\u2019s water loss was either unrelated to underground mining or was caused by naming operations that occurred before October 24,1992.</p>\n<p id=\"b731-5\">In addition, the hearing officer\u2019s opinion stated that G <em>&amp; </em>A obtained its permit to conduct mining operations in 1984. Smith\u2019s \u201creplacement\u201d well, the subject of this appeal, was drilled in 1987. Code \u00a7 45.1-258(B) requires the replacement of water lost \u201cfrom a well or spring in existence prior to the application for a surface coal mining and reclamation permit ... resulting from underground coal mining operations.\u201d Therefore, even if mining operations of G &amp; A after October 24, 1992 caused water loss, because Smith\u2019s replacement well was drilled three years after G <em>&amp; </em>A obtained its permit, the loss is not covered under the statute. Code \u00a7 45.1-258(B); 4 VAC \u00a7 25-130-817.41(j).</p>\n<p id=\"b731-6\">Smith argues that the DMLR\u2019s decision was \u201carbitrary\u201d and that it acted outside the scope of its authority in this case. There has been no showing that the DMLR acted in an arbitrary manner, nor that it acted outside the scope of its authority in rendering the Technical Report which determined that Smith\u2019s alleged water losses were not compensable. Smith has also failed to show that a reasonable mind would necessarily disagree with these findings. Because we review the decision of an agency with deference to its findings of fact, where substantial evidence in the record exists to support the agency\u2019s conclusions, we may not substitute our own judgment for that of the agency. <em>Johnston-Willis, Ltd. v. Kenley, </em>6 Va.App. 231, 242, 369 S.E.2d 1, 7-8 (1988). We hold that substantial evidence was introduced to support the hearing officer\u2019s conclusion that the DMLR properly refused to order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"688\">*688</page-number>the replacement of Smith\u2019s water losses. The circuit court did not err in its affirmation of the agency decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-4\">\n<em>CONCLUSION</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b732-5\">Because substantial evidence in the agency record supports the decision that the DMLR was not required to order G &amp; A to replace Smith\u2019s lost residential water supplies, the trial court\u2019s order upholding the agency\u2019s determination is affirmed. Smith\u2019s additional \u201cRequest for Writ Requiring Completion of Record by Agency\u201d is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b732-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b727-8\">. The provisions of Part 5A of the Rules relating to completion of the record refer to the transmittal of the record from the circuit court to the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"684\">*684</page-number>Court of Appeals. Part 5A does not apply to the transmittal of the record from the agency to the circuit court. <em>See </em>Rule 2A:3.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b730-9\">. Smith attempted to rely on an unrelated matter, referred to as the \"Nelson\u201d report at the hearing. Scales testified that Smith\u2019s attempt to rely on the Nelson report was mistaken, because although in \"Nelson\u201d the hydrology had been adversely affected, it was a \"local impact\u201d which was not related to Smith\u2019s well. Additionally, the mining activities that caused the water loss on the Nelson properly occurred before October 24, 1992; consequently, it was not compensable under Code \u00a7 45.1-258(13).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
