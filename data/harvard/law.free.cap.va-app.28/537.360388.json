He contends the trial court violated his due process rights by imposing pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-10(g) additional punishment for each offense in the form of a suspended term of post-release incarceration, which was \u201cconditioned upon his successful completion of a period of post-release supervision pursuant to \u00a7 19.2-295.2.\u201d For the reasons that follow, we reject appellant\u2019s contention and affirm his sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-8\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b583-9\">On April 9, 1997, appellant was convicted by a jury for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, after previously having been convicted of a like offense, and for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute within one-thousand feet of a school, in violation of Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-248 and 18.2-255.2, respectively. Both offenses occurred on June 11, 1996. The jury fixed punishment at five years and a $1 fine on the first charge and one year and a $1 fine on the second charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-10\">On May 19, 1997, the trial judge sentenced appellant in accordance with the jury verdicts. In addition, pursuant to Code \u00a7 18.2-10, he sentenced appellant to a suspended post-release term of three years on each offense. Pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-295.2(A), he imposed a three-year term of post-release supervision on each charge. Counsel for appellant objected, arguing that the post-release terms violated appellant\u2019s right to due process because they were beyond the sentences imposed by the jury. The trial court rejected appellant\u2019s contention, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b583-12\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b583-13\">Appellant contends the trial court\u2019s imposition of post-release terms of suspended incarceration and supervision un<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>der Code \u00a7\u00a7 18.2-10 and 19.2-295.2 violated his due process right to be sentenced by the jury. Guided by the logic we employed in <em>Allard v. Commonwealth, </em>24 Va.App. 57, 480 S.E.2d 139 (1997),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we affirm appellant\u2019s sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-5\">In Virginia, the legislature has given juries the power to \u201csentence [a] defendant according to the evidence in the trial and within the limits set by the General Assembly for the crimes committed.\u201d <em>See Walker v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 50, 62, 486 S.E.2d 126, 132 (1997); <em>see also </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-295, 19.2-295.1. \u201cThis phenomenon [of jury sentencing] did not arise by accident; the General Assembly made a conscious decision to depart from the common law, under which the court sentenced the defendant.\u201d <em>Walker, </em>25 Va.App. at 61, 486 S.E.2d at 131-32.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-6\">However, nothing in the United States or Virginia Constitution gives a defendant the right to be sentenced by a jury or solely by a jury. <em>See Fogg v. Commonwealth, </em>215 Va. 164, 166-67, 207 S.E.2d 847, 849-50 (1974). As we recognized in <em>Allard, </em>\u201c \u2018[t]he choice of sentencing procedures is a matter for legislative determination^]\u2019 [and] ... under Virginia\u2019s statutory scheme, the sentence ascertained by the jury is not final or absolute.\u201d <em>Allard, </em>24 Va.App. at 67, 480 S.E.2d at 144 (quoting <em>Duncan v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 342, 344-45, 343 S.E.2d 392, 393-94 (1986)).</p>\n<p id=\"b584-7\">Code \u00a7 19.2-303, for example, provides that, \u201c[a]fter conviction, whether with or without a jury, the court may suspend imposition of sentence or suspend the sentence in whole or part and in addition may place the accused on probation under such conditions as the court shall determine.... \u201d That statutory authorization is long standing in Virginia. <em>See </em>1918 Acts ch. 349 \u00a7 2 (enacting predecessor code section). Similarly, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>Code \u00a7 19.2-295.2, and related provisions in Code \u00a7 18.2-10,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> expressly permit the court under certain circumstances to enlarge the sentence recommended by the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-5\">At the time the court imposes sentence upon a conviction for any felony offense committed on or after January 1, 1995, the court may, in addition to any other punishment imposed if such other punishment includes an active term of incarceration in a state or local correctional facility, impose a term in addition to the active term of not less than six months nor more than three years, as the court may determine. Such additional term shall be suspended and the defendant placed under post-release supervision upon release from the active term of incarceration.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-6\">Code \u00a7 19.2-295.2(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b585-7\">Appellant contends that Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1, which provides for bifurcated jury sentencing,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> gives an accused a due process right to be sentenced by a jury, thereby rendering unconstitutional the provisions of Code \u00a7 19.2-295.2, which permit the imposition of a post-release suspended sentence and supervision. Again, guided by the reasoning in <em>Allard, </em>we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>Although we did not expressly consider the provisions of Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 in <em>Allard, </em>we discussed principles of statutory interpretation that are equally applicable here. As we said in <em>Allard, </em>\u201c[a] fundamental rule of statutory construction requires that courts view the entire body of legislation and the statutory scheme to determine the \u2018true intention of each part.\u2019 \u201d 24 Va.App. at 67, 480 S.E.2d at 144 (quoting <em>Virginia Real Estate Bd. v. Clay, </em>9 Va.App. 152, 157, 384 S.E.2d 622, 625 (1989) (quoting <em>McDaniel v. Commonwealth, </em>199 Va. 287, 292, 99 S.E.2d 623, 627 (1957))). \u201cTo do so, \u2018[t]wo statutes which are closely interrelated must be read and construed together and effect given to all of their provisions.\u2019 Potentially conflicting statutes should be harmonized to give force and effect to each.\u201d <em>Zamani v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 59, 63, 492 S.E.2d 854, 856 (1997) (quoting <em>ACB Trucking, Inc. v. Griffin, </em>5 Va.App. 542, 547-48, 365 S.E.2d 334, 337-38 (1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-5\">To interpret Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 in the manner appellant urges would violate these principles. Furthermore, as we reasoned in <em>AUard, </em>\u201ca plain reading\u201d of \u00a7 19.2-295.2 \u201creveals that [it] applies to both bench and jury trials.\u201d 24 Va.App. at 67, 480 S.E.2d at 144. Therefore, we hold that the legislature intended the procedures outlined in Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 for the jury\u2019s ascertainment of punishment to be subject to (1) the provisions of \u00a7 19.2-295, which require the jury\u2019s sentence to be \u201c[w]ithin the limits prescribed by law\u201d; (2) the provisions of \u00a7 19.2-295.2, which permit the trial court to impose a suspended term of incarceration and post-release supervision when the jury\u2019s sentence includes an active term of incarceration; and (3) the provisions of Code \u00a7 19.2-303, which permit the trial court to suspend some or all of a sentence and impose probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b586-6\">As construed above, the provisions of Code \u00a7 19.2-295.2 do not violate due process as alleged by appellant and do not conflict with Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-295, 19.2-295.1 or 19.2-303. Therefore, the trial court did not violate appellant\u2019s due process <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>rights by imposing post-release periods of suspended incarceration and supervision pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-295.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">For these reasons, we affirm appellant\u2019s sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b584-8\">. Appellant contends that the portion of <em>Allard </em>rejecting the argument he advances here is dicta and, therefore, is not controlling. Assuming without deciding that appellant is correct, we remain free to make independent application of the reasoning in <em>Allard </em>to the facts of this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b585-8\">. The relevant portions of Code \u00a7 18.2-10 provide:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-9\">For any felony offense committed on or after January 1, 1995, the court may impose an additional term of not less than six months nor more than three years, which shall be suspended conditioned upon successful completion of a period of post-release supervision pursuant to \u00a7 19.2-295.2 and compliance with such other terms as the sentencing court may require. However, such additional term may only be imposed when the sentence includes an active term of incarceration in a correctional facility.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b585-10\">Code \u00a7 19.2-295.2(A) paraphrases this language and contains additional provisions regarding the period of supervision.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b585-11\">. Code \u00a7 19.2-295.1 provides that, \u2018\u2018[i]n cases of trial by jury, upon a finding that the defendant is guilty of a felony, a separate proceeding limited to the ascertainment of punishment shall be held as soon as practicable before the same jury.\u201d In that proceeding, the Commonwealth may introduce evidence of aggravating factors, including prior convictions, and \"the defendant may introduce relevant, admissible evidence related to punishment.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
