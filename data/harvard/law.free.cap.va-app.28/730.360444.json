Pitt (appellant) appeals his conviction for attempted robbery. He contends the trial court abused its discretion when it granted the Commonwealth\u2019s pretrial motion made pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-262.1 to try him jointly with Lambert Lee Bonds. Appellant argues that, because the Commonwealth intended to introduce at their joint trial Bonds\u2019 out-of-court confession incriminating appellant, the trial court erred when it concluded appellant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to confront the witnesses against him would not be compromised. The Commonwealth contends that Bonds\u2019 statement was admissible under Virginia\u2019s \u201cstatement against penal interest\u201d exception to the hearsay rule, which also rendered it admissible against appellant without violating appellant\u2019s rights under the Confrontation Clause. For the reasons that follow and the position taken by Judge Lemons in his concurring opinion, we affirm the conviction. I would hold, as would Judge Benton, that admission of the statement violated Virginia\u2019s hearsay rule. But, I would hold that its admission was harmless error. I would also hold that its admission did not violate the Confrontation Clause. For these reasons, I would hold that the trial court\u2019s error in joining the trial was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b778-10\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b778-11\">Around 4:00 a.m. on May 29, 1996, appellant and Bonds were arrested in connection with the attempted robbery of Randy Williams (victim). Appellant and Bonds were taken to police headquarters, where each separately waived his <em>Mi</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number><em>randa </em>rights and made a statement to Detective Samuel A. Thomson. Appellant and Bonds were subsequently indicted for attempted robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-5\">Prior to trial, the Commonwealth moved for a joint trial of appellant and Bonds pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-262.1. At a hearing on the Commonwealth\u2019s motion, appellant\u2019s counsel argued that, because both appellant and Bonds made statements to Detective Thomson that the Commonwealth would seek to admit at trial and because neither defendant was likely to testify, \u201cthe Commonwealth is going to have a problem with <em>[Bruton </em>].\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s counsel argued:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-6\">[Ujnder <em>[Bruton], </em>the United States Supreme Court has found that in instances where each defendant has made statements and if neither one takes the stand, neither one of those defendant\u2019s statements can be used against the other.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b779-7\">... I would ask the court, based on the fact that the Commonwealth has got a very real <em>[Bruton </em>] problem here ... that regardless of judicial economy[,] the prejudice to either one of these defendants is going to be so great depending upon the admissibility of either portions of their statements that they can\u2019t be tried together. They need, under the law, to be tried separately.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b779-8\">At the conclusion of the hearing, the trial court granted the Commonwealth\u2019s motion for a joint trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b779-9\">At the joint jury trial, the victim testified that he was walking home from a friend\u2019s house at about 3:45 a.m. on May 29, 1996, when he saw appellant, Bonds, and one other person riding bicycles in a parking lot. Bonds and the unidentified person rode past the victim, and appellant stopped his bike next to the victim. According to the victim, appellant told him, \u201cI got that killer,\u201d and asked the victim if he was \u201clooking.\u201d The victim understood that appellant was talking about illegal drugs and responded by saying, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t do <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"736\">*736</page-number>things like that.\u201d Appellant then rode away on his bike in \u201cthe same direction the other guys was going.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">The victim testified that, after appellant left him, he had \u201ca weary feeling something [was] going to happen.\u201d As a precaution, he removed a twenty-dollar bill from his pocket and placed it inside his mouth. The victim continued walking toward his home. A short while later, appellant and Bonds returned on their bikes and followed the victim. Appellant started asking the victim about drugs. The victim told appellant, \u201cI don\u2019t do that,\u201d and continued walking. After the victim attempted to elude appellant and Bonds by cutting through a grassy area, appellant approached on his bike, dismounted, and blocked the victim\u2019s path. Appellant then grabbed the victim, and the two started \u201ctussling and wrestling.\u201d According to the victim, Bonds then joined the fray and wrestled the victim to the ground. Appellant placed his knees on the victim\u2019s arms, searched through his pockets, and attempted to pry open the victim\u2019s mouth. The victim heard appellant say, \u201cIt is in his mouth.\u201d After about three minutes, the police arrived at the scene, and appellant attempted to flee. The victim testified he was not injured during the fracas with appellant and Bonds, and no property was actually taken from him.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-6\">Detective Thomson testified that he met with appellant and Bonds shortly after they were brought to police headquarters on May 29, 1996. Detective Thomson met with appellant and Bonds in separate rooms at different times. The detective testified that he first met with appellant at 5:45 a.m. According to Detective Thomson, appellant waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights and initially stated he \u201cknew nothing about the robbery.\u201d Appellant stated he thought he had been arrested for assault. Appellant also stated that he knew the victim and that the victim \u201cwas bothering him trying to make cocaine sales.\u201d At this point, the detective stepped out of the room with appellant and met with Bonds at 5:55 a.m. The record does not indicate what, if anything, Bonds told the detective during this meeting.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"737\">*737</page-number>Detective Thomson then returned at 6:00 a.m. and told appellant he did not believe his account. After Detective Thomson provided appellant with a cigarette, appellant stated he was riding bicycles with Bonds when he encountered the victim. Appellant stated he attempted to \u201cobtain cocaine in case [the victim] had cocaine on him.\u201d Appellant stated that he proceeded to \u201c[get] in a struggle with [the victim]\u201d and \u201c[t]hey went to the ground.\u201d According to appellant, \u201cBonds helped to get [the victim] on the ground.\u201d Appellant stated that, when he was on the ground with the victim, he \u201ctried to get cocaine out of [the victim\u2019s mouth]\u201d by prying it open with his hands.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">Detective Thomson testified that he \u201ccame back at 6:48 a.m.\u201d to speak with Bonds, who had previously waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Bonds indicated that he wished to make a statement. Detective Thomson testified that he and Bonds discussed Bonds\u2019 account of the morning\u2019s events, and, at 7:15 a.m., the detective recorded Bonds\u2019 statement on a tape.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">At this point in the trial, the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney indicated her intent to play for the jury the tape of Bonds\u2019 statement. Before the tape was played, appellant\u2019s counsel objected to the admission of Bonds\u2019 statements in the case against appellant. The trial court overruled the objection, stating, \u201cThe jury will be instructed at the time. The evidence is individual as to evidence against each defendant. It will be clear to them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b781-7\">The tape of Bonds\u2019 statement was then played for the jury and admitted into evidence as Commonwealth\u2019s exhibit 1. In his statement,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Bonds said that he and appellant were riding bikes together around 4:00 a.m. on May 29 when they saw the victim. Bonds stated that appellant approached the victim to inquire about obtaining \u201crock cocaine.\u201d Bonds stated that appellant \u201csmoke[d] a little rock,\u201d but he (Bonds) did not use cocaine. According to Bonds, when the victim did not \u201cgive [appellant] a piece of the rock,\u201d appellant met up with Bonds <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"738\">*738</page-number>and told Bonds to ride with him as he followed the victim. Appellant then rode ahead of Bonds and started talking to the victim. As Bonds approached on his bike, appellant and the victim started wrestling. Bonds stated that, when he saw the victim \u201cgetting the best of [appellant],\u201d Bonds \u201cbumped into them to give [appellant] an equal chance with the wrestling.\u201d As Bonds was on the ground wrestling with appellant and the victim, he saw appellant attempt to pry open the victim\u2019s mouth in order to take cocaine appellant believed was hidden there. Bonds stated that he \u201cjust wrestled\u201d the victim down \u201clike a football tackle.\u201d When asked if the victim was injured, Bonds stated, \u201cthere was no trying to hurt no one or nothing like that.\u201d He also stated that neither he nor appellant took any of the victim\u2019s property. Bonds concluded his statement by saying that \u201ceverybody knows ... I\u2019m not a robber or anything like that.\u201d Near the end of the interview, Detective Thomson reminded Bonds that the detective had earlier told him he would talk to the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney and the magistrate \u201cin reference to this case.\u201d After the tape was played, Detective Thomson testified that, following the interview with Bonds, he took appellant and Bonds to the magistrate. Detective Thomson testified that he told the magistrate that \u201cMr. Bonds was cooperative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b782-5\">At the conclusion of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, appellant called Bonds as a witness. Bonds asserted his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and refused to testify about the incident with the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">At the conclusion of the evidence, the trial court gave the following instruction to the jury:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-7\">The Court instructs the jury that any statements made by Lambert Lee Bonds to the police are not evidence against Deshon W. Pitt and may not be considered by you in determining the guilt or innocence of Deshon W. Pitt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b782-8\">The Court instructs the jury that the Commonwealth\u2019s Exhibit No. _JL_ is not evidence against the Defendant, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"739\">*739</page-number>Deshon Pitt, and should not be considered by you against him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b783-4\">The jury convicted appellant of attempted robbery and sentenced him to ten years in prison. Bonds was found guilty of assault and battery and sentenced to six months in jail and a fine of $1,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-6\">MOTION FOR JOINT TRIAL UNDER CODE \u00a7 19.2-262.1</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">Appellant contends the trial court abused its discretion by permitting him to be tried jointly with Bonds pursuant to the provisions of Code \u00a7 19.2-262.1. He argues the trial court erred when it concluded that a joint trial did not pose a serious risk of compromising appellant\u2019s right under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to confront the witnesses against him. Appellant argues that the portions of Bonds\u2019 taped statement that incriminated appellant were inadmissible against appellant under the Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause because Bonds was unavailable for cross-examination and his statement did not bear adequate \u201cindicia of reliability.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The Commonwealth argues that Bonds\u2019 statement was properly admitted as a statement against penal interest under Virginia hearsay rules and, therefore, did not violate the Confrontation Clause. I would hold that the admission of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>Bonds\u2019 statement violated Virginia\u2019s hearsay rule but that its admission was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-4\">The relevant portion of the version of Code \u00a7 19.2-262.1 in effect at the time of the Commonwealth\u2019s motion for joinder stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b784-5\">On motion of the Commonwealth, for good cause shown, the court, in its discretion, may order persons charged with participating in contemporaneous and related acts or occurrences ... to be tried jointly unless such joint trial would constitute prejudice to a defendant. If the court finds that a joint trial would constitute prejudice to a defendant, the court shall order severance as to that defendant or provide such other relief justice requires.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">\u201c[P]rejudice does not exist merely because a co-defendant has a better chance of acquittal if tried separately____\u201d <em>Barnes v. Commonwealth, </em>22 Va.App. 406, 412-13, 470 S.E.2d 579, 582 (1996). Rather, \u201c[prejudice requiring severance ... results only when \u2018there is a serious risk that a joint trial would compromise a specific trial right of one of the defendants, or prevent the jury from making a reliable judgment about guilt or innocence.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 412, 470 S.E.2d at 582 (quoting <em>Zafiro v.

Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 462, 464-65, 237 S.E.2d 779, 781 (1977) (defining hearsay). \u201cAs a general rule, hearsay evidence is incompetent and inadmissible,\u201d and \u201c[t]he party seeking to rely upon an exception to the hearsay rule has the burden of establishing admissibility.\u201d <em>Neal v.

Under the statement against penal interest exception to Virginia\u2019s hearsay rule, an out-of-court statement is admissible to prove the truth of the matters asserted therein if three requirements are met: (1) \u201cthe declarant must be \u2018unavailable\u2019 to testify at trial\u201d; (2) \u201cthe statement must be against the declarant\u2019s interest at the time it was made\u201d; and (3) \u201cthe declarant must be aware at the time the statement is made that it is against his or her interest to make it.\u201d <em>Randolph v. Commonwealth, </em>24 Va.App. 345, 355, 482 S.E.2d 101, 105-06 (1997) (citations omitted).

Bonds\u2019 statement to Detective Thomson satisfies only two of the three elements of a statement against penal interest. Under the first element, the record indicates Bonds was unavailable as a witness because he asserted his Fifth Amendment right not to testify. <em>See Randolph, </em>24 Va.App. at 356, 482 S.E.2d at 106. Under the second element, Bonds\u2019 statement was against his penal interest because he admitted he tackled the victim to the ground, which not only constituted a battery, for which he was convicted, but also assisted appellant\u2019s attempt to rob the victim, thereby subjecting Bonds to liability as a principal in the second degree for attempted robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b787-5\">However, the record does not support the conclusion that Bonds was <em>aware </em>his comments, particularly the portions incriminating appellant, were against his penal interest at the time he made them. <em>See Lilly v. Commonwealth, </em>255 Va. 558, 573, 499 S.E.2d 522, 533, <em>cert. granted, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 119 S.Ct. 443, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (1998). As the Supreme Court held in <em>Lilly, </em>a \u201cstatement\u2019s admissibility is based upon the [declarant\u2019s] <em>subjective </em>belief that he is making admissions against his penal interest.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). In <em>Lilly, </em>the declarant admitted that he stole liquor during the breaking and entering of the victim\u2019s house. <em>Id. </em>at 572, 499 S.E.2d at 533; <em>see also Chandler v. Commonwealth, </em>249 Va. 270, 278-79, 455 S.E.2d 219, 224-25 (1995) (holding evidence proved declarant knew statement was against her interest because she expressly told investigating officer that \u201cshe thought she could be an accessory to the crimes\u201d); <em>Randolph, </em>24 Va.App. at 356-57, 482 S.E.2d at 106 (holding evidence proved declarant knew statement was against her interest because she admitted, while under arrest for credit card theft, that she and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"744\">*744</page-number>appellant went to the airport \u201cto steal ... to pick pockets\u201d); <em>Raia, </em>23 Va.App. at 549-50, 478 S.E.2d at 330 (holding evidence proved declarant knew statement was against her interest because she admitted in statement that she and defendant had planned to lure victim to parking area where defendant would do \u201cwhatever was necessary, including shooting [victim],\u201d to \u201cremove [victim] from her life\u201d and that the plan \u201cwas more her idea than [defendant\u2019s]\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b788-5\">In appellant\u2019s case, by contrast, the vast majority of Bonds\u2019 statement placed the blame on appellant for the fracas with the victim and minimized Bonds\u2019 role in the incident. He characterized his role as that of an innocent bystander who intervened only when necessary to protect appellant. Bonds stated that appellant used cocaine and approached the victim in order to obtain a quantity of this drug. He stated that appellant started wrestling with the victim when the victim \u201cdidn\u2019t give [appellant] a piece of the rock\u201d and that appellant\u2019s intention was to pry open the victim\u2019s mouth and take the cocaine he thought was hidden there. Bonds\u2019 statement that he did not use cocaine tended to negate any motive he might have had for robbing the victim. In addition, he stated he rode behind appellant and the victim and \u201ccaught up to them.\u201d His statements that he approached the scene of the confrontation after appellant and the victim started talking and that he \u201cdidn\u2019t know if [appellant] knew this guy or what\u201d also tend to show he was unaware of appellant\u2019s intent. Bonds stated that he tackled appellant and the victim only when it appeared \u201cthe victim was getting the best of [appellant] in the wrestling.\u201d He also down-played the extent of his intervention. He stated that he \u201cjust wrestled [the victim] down,\u201d that it was \u201clike a football tackle,\u201d and that \u201cthere was no trying to hurt no one or nothing like that.\u201d Bonds concluded his statement by saying, \u201ceverybody knows ... that I\u2019m, you know, I\u2019m not a robber or anything like that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b788-6\">Unlike the statements in <em>Lilly, Chandler, Randolph </em>and <em>Raia, </em>Bonds\u2019 statement did not indicate he was aware that his statement implicated him in appellant\u2019s attempt to rob the victim. <em>See Lilly, </em>255 Va. at 572, 499 S.E.2d at 533; <em>Chan</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"745\">*745</page-number><em>dler, </em>249 Va. at 278-79, 455 S.E.2d at 224-25; <em>Randolph, </em>24 Va.App. at 356-57, 482 S.E.2d at 106; <em>Raia, </em>23 Va.App. at 549-50, 478 S.E.2d at 330. Bonds made no express statement indicating his belief that he could be charged as an accessory to appellant\u2019s attempted robbery. Rather, if his statement is taken at face value, Bonds\u2019 description of the incident with the victim indicates that appellant independently decided to attempt to rob the victim and that Bonds was surprised by appellant\u2019s actions. According to Bonds, he joined only to \u201cgive [appellant] an equal chance with the wrestling\u201d when it appeared the victim was \u201cgetting the best of [him]\u201d and not with the intent to assist appellant\u2019s attempt to rob the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-5\">The Commonwealth does not argue that Bonds\u2019 statement falls under any other exception to the hearsay rule. Bonds\u2019 statement to Detective Thomson was thus not admissible against appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-6\">3.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-7\">\n<em>Use of a limiting instruction to prevent jury from considering Bonds\u2019 confession in determining appellant\u2019s guilt</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b789-8\">The trial court acknowledged some concern over whether Bonds\u2019 statement was admissible against appellant, for it expressly instructed the jury that Commonwealth\u2019s exhibit 1 and Bonds\u2019 statements \u201cto the police are not evidence against [appellant] and may not be considered by you in determining the guilt or innocence of [appellant].\u201d However, this instruction was insufficient to avoid prejudice to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b789-9\">In the trial of a single defendant, we ordinarily apply the principle that, \u201c[w]hen evidence that might otherwise be hearsay is admitted for a limited, non-hearsay purpose, the trial court must instruct the jury that they are to consider the evidence for the specific limited purpose; where such a limiting instruction is given, we presume that the jury followed that instruction.\u201d <em>Hanson v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 173, 187, 416 S.E.2d 14, 22 (1992). We see no reason why this principle may not <em>ordinarily </em>be applied when codefendants are tried jointly under Code \u00a7 19.2-262.1 and evi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"746\">*746</page-number>dence is introduced which is admissible against one codefendant but inadmissible against another. <em>See Richardson v. Marsh, </em>481 U.S. 200, 206-07, 107 S.Ct. 1702, 1707, 95 L.Ed.2d 176 (1987) (recognizing \u201cthe almost invariable assumption of the law that jurors follow their instructions\u201d). As we recognized in <em>Barnes, </em>22 Va.App. at 412, 470 S.E.2d at 582, \u201c[i]n determining the propriety of ordering a joint trial of multiple defendants, the degree of prejudice may be balanced against the effectiveness of using other measures to cure any such risk, such as limiting instructions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b790-5\">However, for the reasons discussed by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Bruton v. United States, </em>391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968) \u2014 a case dealing with the admissibility, in a joint trial, of codefendants\u2019 confessions under the Confrontation Clause \u2014 the trial court\u2019s limiting instruction was insufficient to prevent the jury\u2019s improper consideration of Bonds\u2019 statement as evidence against appellant under the facts of this case. As the Court noted in <em>Bruton,</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b790-6\">there are some contexts in which the risk that the jury will not, or cannot, follow instructions is so great, and the consequences of failure so vital to the defendant, that the practical and human limitations of the jury system cannot be ignored. Such a context is presented here, where the powerfully incriminating extrajudicial statements of a codefendant, who stands accused side-by-side with the defendant, are deliberately spread before the jury in a joint trial.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A-x\"><em>Id. </em>at 135-36, 88 S.Ct. at 1627-28 (citations omitted).

The evidence other than Bonds\u2019 statement overwhelmingly proved that appellant attempted to rob the victim. \u201c \u2018An attempt to commit a crime is composed of two elements: (1) The intent to commit it; and (2) a direct, ineffectual act done towards its commission.\u2019 \u201d <em>Haywood v.

According to both, appellant approached the victim and the two had a discussion about illegal drugs. The victim testified that he had placed a twenty-dollar bill inside his mouth before the wrestling match with appellant. The victim testified and appellant stated in his confession that, after they started wrestling, appellant attempted to pry open the victim\u2019s mouth. The victim heard appellant say, \u201cIt is in his mouth.\u201d Appellant stated in his confession that he was attempting \u201cto get cocaine\u201d out of the victim\u2019s mouth.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-7\">Because the evidence of appellant\u2019s guilt was overwhelming, I would hold that the error in ordering the joint trial was harmless under state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-8\">C.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-9\">SIXTH AMENDMENT RIGHT TO CONFRONT WITNESSES</p>\n<p id=\"b792-10\">Next for determination is whether the trial court erred when it concluded that joinder, accompanied by the admission <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>of Bonds\u2019 out-of-court statement, would pose no serious risk to appellant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to cross-examine the witnesses against him.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-5\">The Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment, which applies to the States, provides: \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\u201d U.S. Const. amend. VI; <em>see Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 62-63, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 2537, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980) (citing <em>Pointer v. Texas, </em>380 U.S. 400, 404, 85 S.Ct. 1065, 1068, 13 L.Ed.2d 923 (1965)). The right to confront witnesses secured by the Sixth Amendment encompasses the right to cross-examine them. <em>See Cruz, </em>481 U.S. 186, 107 S.Ct. 1714; <em>Douglas v. Alabama, </em>380 U.S. 415, 418, 85 S.Ct. 1074, 1076, 13 L.Ed.2d 934 (1965). The right to confront and to cross-examine witnesses is a \u201cfunctional right\u201d that \u201cadvance[s] the pursuit of truth\u201d and \u201cpromotes reliability\u201d in criminal trials by \u201censuring that convictions will not be based on the charges of unseen and unknown \u2014 and hence unchallengeable \u2014 individuals.\u201d <em>Lee v. Illinois, </em>476 U.S. 530, 540, 106 S.Ct. 2056, 2062, 90 L.Ed.2d 514 (1986). Applying this Clause in the context of a joint trial of two or more criminal defendants, the United States Supreme Court has held as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AzKq\">[W]here a nontestifying codefendant\u2019s confession incriminating the defendant is not directly admissible against the defendant, <em>see Lee v. Illinois, </em>the Confrontation Clause bars its admission at their joint trial, even if the jury is instructed not to consider it against the defendant, and even if the defendant\u2019s own confession is admitted against him.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b793-6\"><em>Cruz, </em>481 U.S. at 193, 107 S.Ct. at 1719; <em>see also Bruton, </em>391 U.S. at 135-36, 88 S.Ct. at 1627-28; <em>Douglas, </em>380 U.S. at 419-20, 85 S.Ct. at 1077.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-7\">The record makes clear that the admission of Bonds\u2019 out-of-court statement violated appellant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to cross-examine Bonds, <em>unless the statement was directly admissible against appellant. </em>Bonds\u2019 statement to Detective Thomson incriminated appellant. Bonds stated that appellant \u201csmoke[s] a little rock\u201d and approached the victim because \u201che <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"750\">*750</page-number>wanted a piece of [the victim\u2019s] rock [cocaine].\u201d According to Bonds, appellant started wrestling with the victim when the victim was not forthcoming with the drug. Bonds stated that appellant attempted to pry open the victim\u2019s mouth and that his intent was to \u201ctake the rock\u201d from the victim. Furthermore, the record indicates that Bonds asserted his Fifth Amendment right not to testify when he was called to the witness stand and thus was unavailable for cross-examination about his statement. <em>See Boney v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 638, 643, 432 S.E.2d 7, 10 (1993). Thus, despite the trial court\u2019s jury instruction limiting the use of Bonds\u2019 statement and the fact that appellant\u2019s own confession was admitted into evidence against him, the admission of the portions of Bonds\u2019 out-of-court statement incriminating appellant violated appellant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right of confrontation, unless Bonds\u2019 statement was otherwise directly admissible against appellant. <em>See Cruz, </em>481 U.S. at 193, 107 S.Ct. at 1719.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-5\">Next for consideration is whether Bonds\u2019 out-of-court statements incriminating appellant were directly admissible against appellant. Under the standard set forth by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Lee, </em>476 U.S. 530, 106 S.Ct. 2056, I hold that they were.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-6\">1.</p>\n<p id=\"b794-7\">\n<em>Admissibility of an accomplice\u2019s confession that incriminates a criminal defendant under the Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b794-8\">Under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment, a hearsay statement of an unavailable declarant is admissible \u201conly if it bears adequate \u2018indicia of reliability.\u2019 \u201d <em>Roberts, </em>448 U.S. at 66, 100 S.Ct. at 2539.

In support of this holding, the Supreme Court reasoned:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b796-5\">[The] truthfinding function of the Confrontation Clause is uniquely threatened when an accomplice\u2019s confession is sought to be introduced against a criminal defendant without the benefit of cross-examination____ \u201cDue to his strong motivation to implicate the defendant and to exonerate himself, a codefendant\u2019s statements about what the defendant said or did are less credible than ordinary hearsay evidence.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b796-7\"><em>Id. </em>(citation omitted).

Regarding the circumstances surrounding the confession, a court should consider the extent to which the accomplice was \u201cfree from any desire, motive, or impulse ... either to mitigate the appearance of his own culpability by spreading the blame [to the defendant] or to overstate [the defendant\u2019s] involvement in retaliation for her having implicated him in the [crime].\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 544, 106 S.Ct. at 2064. Regarding the interlocking nature of the accomplice\u2019s and the defendant\u2019s confessions, a court should consider the extent to which those portions of the accomplice's confession <em>regarding the defendant\u2019s participation in the crime </em>are substantiated by the defendant\u2019s own confession. <em>See id. </em>at 545, 106 S.Ct. at 2064. When the discrepancies between the statements are \u201cnot insignificant,\u201d the accomplice\u2019s out-of-court confession is inadmissible under the Sixth Amendment. <em>Id.; see Cruz, </em>481 U.S. at 192-93, 107 S.Ct. at 1718-19 (holding that tightly interlocking nature of confessions establishes reliability, for if codefendant\u2019s confession \u201cconfirms essentially the same facts as the defendant\u2019s own confession it is more likely to be true\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b797-5\">Two factors are <em>irrelevant </em>to the inquiry of whether an accomplice\u2019s confession that incriminates a defendant is admissible under the Sixth Amendment: (1) \u201cwhether the [accomplice\u2019s] confession was found to be voluntary for Fifth Amendment purposes,\u201d <em>see Lee, </em>476 U.S. at 544, 106 S.Ct. at 2064 (stating that \u201csuch a finding does not bear on the [Sixth Amendment] question\u201d), and (2) whether the other evidence at trial (except for the defendant\u2019s own confession) tends to corroborate the truth of the accomplice\u2019s statement, <em>see Idaho v. Wright, </em>497 U.S. 805, 822-23, 110 S.Ct. 3139, 3150, 111 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>L.Ed.2d 638 (1990) (stating that such corroboration is \u201cno substitute for cross-examination of the declarant at trial\u201d and would \u201cpermit admission of a presumptively unreliable statement by bootstrapping on the trustworthiness of other evidence at trial\u201d). Instead, as with all hearsay statements that are deemed admissible under the Confrontation Clause, the portion of the accomplice\u2019s confession incriminating the defendant \u201cmust possess indicia of reliability by virtue of its <em>inherent trustworthiness </em>\u201d such that adversarial testing would add little to its reliability. <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). \u201c[T]he \u2018particularized guarantees of trustworthiness\u2019 required for admission under the Confrontation Clause must ... be drawn from the totality of the circumstances that surround the making of the statement and that render the declarant particularly worthy of belief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 820, 110 S.Ct. at 3149.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-5\">2.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-6\">\n<em>Admissibility of Bonds\u2019 confession against appellant under the Confrontation Clause</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b798-7\">Turning to the facts of this case, sufficient indicia of reliability flow from both the circumstances surrounding Bonds\u2019 confession and the interlocking character of Bonds\u2019 and appellant\u2019s confessions, and these circumstances are sufficient to overcome the Sixth Amendment\u2019s presumption against the admission of Bonds\u2019 uncross-examined statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b798-8\">First, the evidence regarding the circumstances surrounding Detective Thomson\u2019s interview of Bonds indicates that Bonds\u2019 statements were relatively free of any desire, motive, or impulse to overstate appellant\u2019s involvement in the incident with the victim. From the beginning of his encounter with the detective, Bonds indicated a willingness to cooperate by waiving his <em>Miranda </em>rights and answering all of the questions Detective Thomson posed. At no point did Bonds refuse to speak with the detective. Moreover, Bonds made these statements in a context that was free of any motive to retaliate against appellant for statements he made to the police implicating Bonds. The record indicates that, despite Detective <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>Thomson\u2019s knowledge of appellant\u2019s statement that Bonds helped appellant wrestle the victim to the ground, the detective never told Bonds that appellant had implicated him in the incident. Finally, neither the detective nor any other authority offered Bonds leniency in the prosecution against him in exchange for his testimony against appellant. Although Detective Thomson testified that he told Bonds he would speak to the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney and the magistrate, the detective did not testify what he told Bonds he would say on Bonds\u2019 behalf. The detective did testify that he later told the magistrate that Bonds had been \u201ccooperative.\u201d The record does not establish what, if anything, the detective said to the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney regarding Bonds. Thus, the record does not indicate that, at the time of his confession, Bonds stood to gain substantively by inculpating appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">In addition, the portion of Bonds\u2019 confession regarding appellant\u2019s participation in the incident with the victim is thoroughly substantiated by appellant\u2019s own confession. <em>See Cruz, </em>481 U.S. at 193-94, 107 S.Ct. at 1719 (stating that \u201cthe defendant\u2019s confession may be considered ... in assessing whether his codefendant\u2019s statements are supported by sufficient \u2018indicia of reliability\u2019 to be directly admissible against him\u201d under the Confrontation Clause); <em>Lee, </em>476 U.S. at 543-44, 106 S.Ct. at 2063-64 (same). Both appellant and Bonds told Detective Thomson that they were riding bicycles together when they came upon the victim. Both stated that appellant approached the victim in order to obtain cocaine from him. Although some collateral detail in Bonds\u2019 account is missing from appellant\u2019s version regarding the lapse of time between the initial encounter with the victim and the ensuing struggle, both Bonds and appellant stated that appellant started struggling with the victim in order to steal cocaine from the victim\u2019s person. Both Bonds and appellant stated that Bonds joined the fracas by helping appellant tackle the victim to the ground. Finally, both stated that appellant attempted to pry open the victim\u2019s mouth to steal \u201crock\u201d cocaine appellant believed was concealed inside. In addition, statements Bonds made about other factual issues that appellant did not address <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>actually tended to <em>limit </em>appellant\u2019s liability for more serious criminal charges, such as robbery or attempted malicious wounding. Bonds stated that appellant did not succeed in taking any of the victim\u2019s property and that \u201cthere was no trying to hurt no one or nothing like that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">Because the circumstances surrounding Bonds\u2019 confession indicate they were free of all but a theoretical motive to incriminate appellant and because the portions of Bonds\u2019 and appellant\u2019s confessions regarding appellant\u2019s involvement in the crime were essentially identical in all material respects, the portions of Bonds\u2019 out-of-court confession regarding appellant\u2019s involvement were supported by sufficient, particularized guarantees of trustworthiness to permit their admission against appellant despite the fact that Bonds was unavailable for cross-examination. In this case, the portions of Bonds\u2019 confession incriminating appellant were \u201cso trustworthy that cross-examination of the declarant would [have been] of marginal utility.\u201d <em>Wright, </em>497 U.S. at 823, 110 S.Ct. at 3150.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b800-8\">Based upon the foregoing analysis, I would hold as follows: Although the trial court erred in ordering the joint trial, that ruling and the trial court\u2019s subsequent ruling allowing Bonds\u2019 statement to be introduced at the joint trial were harmless error. In addition, the admission of this statement did not violate appellant\u2019s rights under the Confrontation Clause.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>Because Judge Lemons believes that Bonds\u2019 statement was admissible, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-4\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b801-5\">APPENDIX TO OPINION OF THE COUKT</p>\n<p id=\"A20\">The following is a transcription of Bonds\u2019s taped statement, which was admitted into evidence as Commonwealth\u2019s exhibit 1:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b801-6\">DETECTIVE THOMSON: This is a recording of an interview conducted with Mr. Bonds from Detective S.A.

Mr. Bonds, is this true?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-5\">BONDS: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-6\">DETECTIVE THOMSON: Mr. Bonds, concerning an incident that happened today between Mr. Williams and Mr. Pitt, you were riding your bike this morning with Mr. Pitt at approximately 4:00 a.m. in front of the trailer park located on 1152 Virginia (undecipherable) Boulevard in the city of Virginia Beach, is this correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-7\">BONDS: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-8\">DETECTIVE THOMSON: Okay, can you tell exactly what happened from that time on and how you got involved with the situation this morning that brought you to the police headquarters?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-9\">BONDS: Okay, me and Mr. Pitt was riding our bikes around the trailer park. And, the victim came up, I guess to buy some rocks, and Mr. Pitt wanted a piece of his rock, and I guess he didn\u2019t give him a piece of the rock.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Acy\">DETECTIVE THOMSON: Okay, you said \u201crock.\u201d Are you referring to rock cocaine?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-10\">BONDS: Yes, rock cocaine. And, so, Mr. Pitt called me to come on and ride down Virginia Beach Boulevard behind the victim. So, we\u2019re riding behind the victim \u2014 I\u2019m riding behind the victim, Mr. Pitt\u2019s talking to the victim. And, they were saying a few words, and the next thing you know they got into a struggle. I tackled both of them. Knock them both to the ground. And that when the officers came up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-11\">DETECTIVE THOMSON: What was the reason for knocking Mr. Pitt and Mr. Williams to the ground?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b802-12\">BONDS: Um, Mr. Pitt was \u2014 the victim was getting the best of Mr. Pitt on the wrestling, and, I bumped into them to give Mr. Pitt an equal chance with the wrestling.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"759\">*759</page-number>DETECTIVE THOMSON: Okay. Um, did you hear anything in reference to, um, taking any money or was this just strictly trying to take the rock from Mr. Williams?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-5\">BONDS: No, it was the rock.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-6\">DETECTIVE THOMSON: Alright. So, Mr. Pitt, that was his intention. Why did Mr. Pitt want his rock cocaine? Does Mr. Pitt have any problems?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-7\">BONDS: Uh, I\u2019m not sure about his problem, but he smoke a little rock.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-8\">DETECTIVE THOMSON: Okay. Do you smoke any rock, sir?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-9\">BONDS: No, no, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-10\">DETECTIVE THOMSON: Okay. Uh, is there anything else you can \u2014 as far as the victim, did you ever hit the victim or touch him in any other way or did you just wrestle with him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-11\">BONDS: No, I just wrestled him down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-12\">DETECTIVE THOMSON: Okay. How long did it take you to do that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-13\">BONDS: Not long \u2014 like a football tackle.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-14\">DETECTIVE THOMSON: Okay. Did the victim \u2014 did you ever hear the victim yelling for help?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-15\">BONDS: Uh, he hollered. I think he did holler. Uh, by the time he hollered, the police was there, so I don\u2019t....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ap3\">DETECTIVE THOMSON: Okay. Uh, were you all riding down Virginia Beach Boulevard. You live at 1152 Virginia Beach Boulevard?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-16\">BONDS: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-17\">DETECTIVE THOMSON: What was the reason for following the victim? Were y\u2019all heading in that direction anyway? Or were you just \u2014 did Mr. Pitt want to follow the victim?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b803-18\">BONDS: We was heading that way anyway. But, uh, the victim had came up, I guess \u2014 I didn\u2019t know if Mr. Pitt knew this guy or what. So, they, they was, like, walking and riding, he was riding the bike and walking with him at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"760\">*760</page-number>same time. I was at the store by the time they crossed the street, by the gas station. I rode the bike and I caught up with them. I didn\u2019t catch all the way up with them. And, that\u2019s how I got here.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-5\">DETECTIVE THOMSON: Was there any injury to the victim? Was the victim hurt?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-6\">BONDS: No, no. There was no, there was no trying to hurt no one or nothing like that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-7\">DETECTIVE THOMSON: Okay. Did you all take any property from the victim?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-8\">BONDS: Any property?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-9\">DETECTIVE THOMSON: Right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-10\">BONDS: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-11\">DETECTIVE THOMSON: How about Mr. Pitt?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-12\">BONDS: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-13\">DETECTIVE THOMSON: Okay. So you all never got a hold of any property whatsoever?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-14\">BONDS: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-15\">DETECTIVE THOMSON: Who was trying to open the victim\u2019s mouth trying to get to the money?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-16\">BONDS: Mr. Pitt was trying to open his mouth up. DETECTIVE THOMSON: Okay. What were you doing? Help holding the victim at the time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-17\">BONDS: At that time, I was on the ground wrestling with both of them at that time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-18\">DETECTIVE THOMSON: At that time period?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-19\">BONDS: Mmm-hmm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-20\">DETECTIVE THOMSON: Okay. Uh, Mr. Bonds, as far as with me being a detective, uh, I\u2019ve been fair with you ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ap9d\">BONDS: Mmm-hmm.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b804-21\">DETECTIVE THOMSON: and I told you I\u2019d talk to the Commonwealth\u2019s attorney in reference to this case.

A transcript of this statement is attached as an appendix.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b783-8\">. The Commonwealth sirgues that Rule 5A:18 bars appellant from arguing on appeal that his Sixth Amendment right to cross-examine Bonds was prejudiced by the admission of Bonds' confession at a joint trial. The Commonwealth asserts that \u201cthis argument was not raised with specificity in the trial court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b783-9\">Appellant\u2019s reference to the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Bruton, </em>391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, at the hearing on the Commonwealth\u2019s motion for joinder was sufficient under Rule 5A:18 to place the trial court on notice that he was relying on his Sixth Amendment right to cross-examine Bonds as a ground for his objection to a joint trial. In <em>Bruton, </em>the Supreme Court relied squarely on the Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause for its holding that a jury instruction is insufficient to cure the prejudice caused when a statement by a non-testifying codefendant incriminating the defendant is admitted at a joint trial. <em>See id. </em>at 126, 88 S.Ct. at 1622-23.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b784-9\">. In 1997, the General Assembly amended Code \u00a7 19.2-262.1 by substituting \"shall order\u201d for \"in its discretion, may order\u201d in the first sentence of the statute. <em>See </em>1997 Va. Acts, ch. 518.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b785-10\">. As early as 1923, the Virginia Supreme Court recognized this exception for statements incriminating a third-party declarant and exculpating an accused, either directly or indirectly. <em>See Hines v. Commonwealth, </em>136 Va. 728, 739-50, 117 S.E. 843, 846-49 (1923); <em>see also Newberry v. Commonwealth, </em>191 Va. 445, 460-62, 61 S.E.2d 318, 325-26 (1950). However, until more recently, no Virginia appellate court appears to have applied this principle in the context of a party\u2019s efforts to admit an accomplice's statement or confession against penal interest that also incriminates the accused. <em>See, e.g., Chandler v. Commonwealth, </em>249 Va. 270, 278-79, 455 S.E.2d 219, 224-25 (1995); <em>Scaggs v.

United States, </em>512 U.S. 594, 603-04, 114 S.Ct. 2431, 2437, 129 L.Ed.2d 476 (1994).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b795-5\">. <em>See supra </em>note 5.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b795-6\">. <em>See infra </em>note 11.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b795-7\">. As such, I reject the Commonwealth\u2019s argument that the admissibility of Bonds\u2019 out-of-court confession against appellant should be determined solely by assessing whether it is admissible under Virginia\u2019s \"declaration against penal interest\u201d exception to the rule against hearsay. In <em>Cruz, </em>when the United States Supreme Court set forth its test for determining the admissibility at a joint trial of a non-testifying codefendant\u2019s confession incriminating the defendant, it <em>expressly </em>cited <em>Lee </em>after the clause, \"where a nontestifying codefendant's confession incriminating the defendant is not directly admissible against the defendant.\" <em>Cruz, </em>481 U.S. at 193, 107 S.Ct. at 1719. From the placement of this citation to <em>Lee, </em>I conclude that the Supreme Court intended the question of whether this type of out-of-court statement is admissible <em>under the Confrontation Clause </em>should be determined according to the standards set forth in <em>Lee </em>rather than according to the state law test for \"declarations against penal interest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b795-8\">Therefore, an examination of whether the trial court's joinder of appellant's trial with Bonds' was reversible error requires two separate analyses \u2014 one regarding the admissibility of Bonds\u2019 statement under the statement against penal interest exception to Virginia\u2019s hearsay rule and a second, separate analysis under the Confrontation Clause. <em>See Idaho v. Wright, </em>497 U.S. 805, 814, 110 S.Ct. 3139, 3146, 111 L.Ed.2d 638 (1990) (holding that Court has been careful \"not to equate the Confrontation Clause\u2019s prohibitions with the general rule prohibiting the admission of hearsay statements\u201d); <em>Lee, </em>476 U.S. at 539, 106 S.Ct. at 2061 (noting that \"admissibility of the evidence as a matter of state law\u201d was not at issue in that case); <em>see also </em>Christine Nowoiyta, Comment, <em>Admitting Confessions of Codefendants: Has Lee v. Illinois </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number><em>Created, an Additional Hearsay Exception?, </em>48 U. Miami L.Rev. 435, 444-45 (1993); Welsh S.

The approach taken by the Virginia Supreme Court and this Court in prior cases involving a Sixth Amendment challenge to the admissibility of an accomplice's confession that incriminates a criminal defendant conflicts with the approach taken by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Lee. See Lilly, </em>255 Va. at 574-75, 499 S.E.2d at 534; <em>Cooper v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 537, 543-44, 496 S.E.2d 77, 79-80 (1998); <em>Randolph, </em>24 Va.App. at 351-57, 482 S.E.2d at <em>104-06; Raia, </em>23 Va.App. at 549-52, 478 S.E.2d at 330-31. In all of these cases, the Virginia Supreme Court and this Court held that the admissibility of an accomplice\u2019s confession against the defendant under the Confrontation Clause hinges upon whether the confession falls within Virginia\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"757\">*757</page-number>\"statement against penal interest\" exception to the hearsay rule. <em>See Lilly, </em>255 Va. at 574-75, 499 S.E.2d at 534; <em>Cooper, </em>26 Va.App. at 543, 496 S.E.2d at 79-80; <em>Randolph, </em>24 Va.App. at 352-57, 482 S.E.2d at 104-06; <em>Raia, </em>23 Va.App. at 549-52, 478 S.E.2d at 330-31.</p>\n<p id=\"b801-8\">The differences between the United States Supreme Court\u2019s approach and Virginia's approach are potentially significant. Specifically, the factors that may be considered in assessing the \u201cindicia of reliability\u201d of an accomplice\u2019s hearsay confession under Virginia\u2019s approach are notably broader than those that may be considered under the United States Supreme Court\u2019s approach in <em>Lee </em>and <em>Wright. </em>Two factors the United States Supreme Court considers irrelevant to the inquiry of whether an accomplice's confession is admissible under the Sixth Amendment are routinely considered under Virginia\u2019s approach to the issue: (1) whether the other evidence at trial tends to corroborate the truth of die accomplice's statement, <em>see Wright, </em>497 U.S. at 822-23, 110 S.Ct. at 3150, and (2) whether the accomplice\u2019s confession was voluntary, <em>see Lee, </em>476 U.S. at 544, 106 S.Ct. at 2064. For examples of Virginia cases considering either of these two factors when assessing the reliability of an accomplice\u2019s confession under the \u201cstatement against penal interest exception,\u201d see <em>Lilly, </em>255 Va. at 574, 499 S.E.2d at 534 (considering corroborating evidence); <em>Cooper, </em>26 Va.App. at 543, 496 S.E.2d at 80 (considering corroborating evidence); <em>Randolph, </em>24 Va.App. at 356, 482 S.E.2d at 106 (considering corroborating evidence); and <em>Raia, </em>23 Va.App. at 551, 478 S.E.2d at 330 (considering corroborating evidence and voluntariness of confession).</p>\n<p id=\"b801-9\">However, applying Virginia\u2019s approach to the facts of this case would still result in affirmance of appellant\u2019s conviction. As discussed in the text, the trial court\u2019s erroneous admission of Bonds\u2019 hearsay confession against appellant as a statement against penal interest was harmless error under Virginia\u2019s hearsay rules and, therefore, would also constitute harmless error under the Confrontation Clause. Thus, the disposition of this case does not require resolution of the apparent conflict between <em>Lee </em>and the above-cited Virginia cases on this issue of Sixth Amendment jurisprudence.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b805-13\">LEMONS, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Ajf\">concurring.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-14\">I concur in the result reached in Judge Elder\u2019s opinion, but write separately because I believe Bonds\u2019 statement was directly admissible against Pitt as a statement against penal interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b805-15\">In order for a statement against penal interest to be admitted as an exception to the hearsay rule, the declarant must be unavailable to testify at trial, the statement must be against the declarant\u2019s interest at the time it was made, and the declarant must be aware at the time the statement is made that it is against his or her interest to make it. Additionally, such a statement is only admissible upon a showing that the declaration is reliable. <em>See Randolph v. Commonwealth, </em>24 Va.App. 345, 355, 482 S.E.2d 101, 105-06 (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b805-16\">Judge Elder states, \u201c[u]nlike the statements in <em>Lilly, Chandler, Randolph </em>and <em>Raia, </em>Bonds\u2019 statements did not indicate that he was aware that his statement implicated him in appellant\u2019s attempt to rob the victim.\u201d Bonds did not have to know that his statement implicated him in an attempted robbery; he only had to know that his statement implicated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"762\">*762</page-number>him in a crime. \u201cIt is important to remember that the interest of the declarant which is threatened by the declaration need not relate to the matters at issue in the case at trial. All that is required is that the declaration be against some pecuniary, proprietary, or penal interest of the declarant.\u201d 2 Charles E. Friend, <em>The Law of Evidence in Virginia </em>\u00a7 18-12 (4th ed. 1996). In this case, Bonds admitted he tackled the victim. While disclaiming any intent to participate in a robbery, Bonds, nonetheless, confessed to an assault. It is inconceivable that a competent adult would be unaware that, under these circumstances, tackling the victim was an assault and that assault was a crime. Bonds\u2019 statement acknowledged criminal liability. In disclaiming his intent to be a \u201crobber,\u201d but still acknowledging that he assaulted the victim, Bonds merely attempted to differentiate the <em>type </em>of crime he committed.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">\u201cTo be considered as being against the declarant\u2019s penal interest, it is not necessary that the statement be sufficient on its own to charge and convict the declarant of the crimes detailed therein. Rather, the statement\u2019s admissibility is based upon the subjective belief of the declarant that he is making admissions against his penal interest and upon other evidence tending to show that the statement is reliable.\u201d <em>Lilly v. Commonwealth, </em>255 Va. 558, 573, 499 S.E.2d 522, 533, <em>cert. granted, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 119 S.Ct. 443, \u2014 L.Ed.2d - (1998) (citations omitted). That the \u201cstatements were self-serving, in that they tended to shift principal responsibility to others or to offer claims of mitigating circumstances, goes to the weight the jury could assign to them and not to their admissibility.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 574, 499 S.E.2d at 534. Judge Elder\u2019s opinion establishes the inherent reliability of the statement. Under Virginia law, Bonds\u2019 statement qualifies as an exception to the hearsay rule and was directly admissible against Pitt.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-8\">Pitt also maintains that the introduction of Bonds\u2019 statement violated his Sixth Amendment right of confrontation.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b806-9\">[W]hen a hearsay declarant is not present for cross-examination at trial, the Confrontation Clause normally requires a showing that he is unavailable. Even then, his statement is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"763\">*763</page-number>admissible only if it bears adequate \u201cindicia of reliability.\u201d Reliability can be inferred without more in a case where the evidence falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception. In other cases, the evidence must be excluded, at least absent a showing of particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ACi\"><em>Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 66, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 2539, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980). \u201c[A]dmissibility into evidence of [a] statement against penal interest of an unavailable witness is a \u2018firmly rooted\u2019 exception to the hearsay rule in Virginia.\u201d <em>Lilly, </em>255 Va. at 575, 499 S.E.2d at 534. But if the statement made against penal interest is made by a codefendant, it must be considered \u201cpresumptively unreliable.\u201d <em>Lee v. Illinois, </em>476 U.S. 530, 545, 106 S.Ct. 2056, 2064, 90 L.Ed.2d 514 (1986). \u201c[T]he arrest statements of a codefendant have traditionally been viewed with special suspicion. Due to his strong motivation to implicate the defendant and to exonerate himself, a codefendant\u2019s statements about what the defendant said or did are less credible than ordinary hearsay evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 541, 106 S.Ct. at 2062. The proponent of the statement may overcome this presumption by showing sufficient \u201cindicia of reliability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 543, 106 S.Ct. at 2063. Judge Elder\u2019s opinion adequately recites the evidence in support of the trustworthiness of Bonds\u2019 statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-5\">Finally, the trial judge instructed the jury that Bonds\u2019 statement could be considered only against Bonds and not against Pitt. As stated above, the statement was directly admissible against Pitt; consequently, unlike the facts in <em>Bruton v. United States, </em>391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968), no cautionary instruction was required.</p>\n<p id=\"b807-6\">Judge Elder\u2019s opinion maintains that Bonds\u2019 statement was inadmissible against Pitt and that the trial judge erred in ordering a joint trial. For the reasons stated above, I disagree; however, I concur with the judgment that if error occurred, it was harmless.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"concurring-in-part-and-dissenting-in-part\">\n<author id=\"b807-7\">BENTON, Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"Aszz\">concurring in part, and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p id=\"AKc\">In <em>Bruton v. United States, </em>391 U.S. 123, 88 S.Ct. 1620, 20 L.Ed.2d 476 (1968), Bruton\u2019s codefendant\u2019s statement was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"764\">*764</page-number>admitted in evidence solely against the codefendant and not as evidence against Bruton. <em>Id. </em>at 125, 88 S.Ct. at 1622. The United States Supreme Court \u201cheld [in <em>Bruton </em>] that a defendant is deprived of his rights under the Confrontation Clause when his codefendant\u2019s incriminating confession is introduced at their joint trial, even if the jury is instructed to consider that confession only against the codefendant.\u201d <em>Cruz v. New York, </em>481 U.S. 186, 187-88, 107 S.Ct. 1714, 1716, 95 L.Ed.2d 162 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b808-5\">The record is uncontroverted that Deshon Pitt and the codefendant, Lambert Bonds, were tried jointly and that the codefendant\u2019s statement implicating Pitt was proved at trial. The record is also uncontroverted that the codefendant\u2019s statement was admitted at trial against the codefendant but not against Pitt. The trial judge so ruled and, indeed, instructed the jury \u201cthat any statements made by ... [the codefendant] to the police are not evidence against ... Pitt and may not be considered by you in determining the guilt or innocence of ... Pitt.\u201d The Commonwealth did not object to the limiting instruction. Indeed, the Commonwealth informed the trial judge that \u201cthe jury needs to be instructed in that regard.\u201d Thus, Pitt\u2019s trial is indistinguishable on the adjudicatory facts from <em>Bruton.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b808-6\">In <em>Cruz, </em>the defendant and the codefendant were tried together. The defendant\u2019s statement was admitted in evidence only against the defendant and the codefendant\u2019s statement, which implicated the defendant, was admitted in evidence only against the codefendant. 481 U.S. at 189, 107 S.Ct. at 1717. The Supreme Court held that the rule announced in <em>\u201cBruton </em>applies where the defendant\u2019s own confession, corroborating that of his codefendant, is introduced against him\u201d in a joint trial. <em>Id. </em>at 188, 193, 107 S.Ct. at 1716, 1719. Thus, the Supreme Court unambiguously \u201ch[e]ld that, where a nontestifying codefendant\u2019s confession incriminating the defendant is not directly admissible against the defendant, the Confrontation Clause bars its admission at their joint trial, even if the jury is instructed not to consider it against the defendant, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"765\">*765</page-number>even if the defendant\u2019s own confession is admitted against him.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 198, 107 S.Ct. at 1719.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-5\">The Confrontation Clause issue that arises in Pitt\u2019s case is substantially similar to the issue in <em>Cruz. </em>Applying <em>Cruz </em>to this case, we must necessarily conclude that a violation of Pitt\u2019s rights under the Confrontation Clause occurred. Furthermore, <em>Cruz </em>expressly bars, as a Confrontation Clause violation under the <em>Bruton </em>rule, introduction of a codefendant\u2019s confession, even if it \u201cinterlocks\u201d with the defendant\u2019s confession. <em>Id. </em>at 191-93, 107 S.Ct. at 1718-19. Thus, by applying the holding in <em>Cruz, </em>which squarely mirrors the circumstances in this case, I would hold that the admission of the codefendant\u2019s statement deprived Pitt of his Sixth Amendment Confrontation Clause rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b809-6\">As an abstract proposition, I agree with several portions of Judge Elder\u2019s opinion. I concur in Part I; I agree with the analyses in Part II (Motion for joint trial under Code \u00a7 19.2-262.1) but not its conclusion that the admission of the codefendant\u2019s statement was harmless; I concur in Part 11(A)(1); I concur substantially in Part 11(A)(2) and in the conclusion that the codefendant\u2019s statement was hearsay; and I concur in Part 11(A)(3). However, I am unable to give more than a qualified agreement because I believe the basic assumption that underlies Judge Elder\u2019s opinion is not applicable to this case. In my judgment, Judge Elder\u2019s opinion is incorrectly premised upon the view that the codefendant\u2019s statement was admissible as evidence against Pitt. It was not. Because it was not admitted in evidence at trial against Pitt, and, indeed, was not admissible against Pitt, the issue in this case is analogous to the issue in <em>Bruton </em>and <em>Cruz </em>and unlike the issue in <em>Lee v. Illinois, </em>476 U.S. 530, 106 S.Ct. 2056, 90 L.Ed.2d 514 (1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b809-7\">Because Judge Elder uses a <em>Lee </em>analysis rather than a <em>Bruton </em>analysis, and for the reasons that I have more fully explained above, I disagree with and dissent from Part 11(B) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"766\">*766</page-number>and all of Part 11(C) of his opinion.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> I would hold that Pitt\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>rights under the Sixth Amendment\u2019s Confrontation Clause were violated. Furthermore, the constitutional error was not harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-5\">Although \u201cConfrontation Clause error[ ] is subject to ... harmless error analysis[,] ... the correct inquiry is whether, assuming that the damaging potential of the [evidence] were fully realized, a reviewing court might nonetheless say that the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Delaware v. Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. 673, 684, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 1438, 89 L.Ed.2d 674 (1986). The Supreme Court noted the following in <em>Cruz:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b813-6\">[I]t seems to us that \u201cinterlocking\u201d bears a positively inverse relationship to devastation. A codefendant\u2019s confession will be relatively harmless if the incriminating story it tells is different from that which the defendant himself is alleged to have told, but enormously damaging if it confirms, in all essential respects, the defendant\u2019s alleged confession. It might be otherwise if the defendant were <em>standing by </em>his confession, in which case it could be said that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"770\">*770</page-number>codefendant\u2019s confession does no more than support the defendant\u2019s very own case. But in the real world of criminal litigation, the defendant is seeking to <em>avoid </em>his confession \u2014 on the ground that it was not accurately reported, or that it was not really true when made. In the present case, for example, petitioner sought to establish that [the codefendant] had a motive for falsely reporting a confession that never in fact occurred. In such circumstances <em>a codefendant\u2019s confession that corroborates the defendant\u2019s confession significantly harms the defendant\u2019s case, </em>whereas one that is positively incompatible gives credence to the defendant\u2019s assertion that his own alleged confession was nonexistent or false. Quite obviously, what the \u201cinterlocking\u201d nature of the codefendant\u2019s confession pertains to is not its <em>harmfulness </em>....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b814-5\">481 U.S. at 192, 107 S.Ct. at 1718-19 (third emphasis added). Under these circumstances and if, as Judge Elder asserts, the statements were \u201cinterlocking,\u201d the error cannot be said to be harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b814-6\">As the Court further noted in <em>Cruz, </em>the interlocking nature of the defendant\u2019s and the codefendant\u2019s confessions was devastating and prejudicial to the defendant in the eyes of the trier of fact for another significant reason. \u201c[F]or example, the precise content and even the existence of [the defendant\u2019s] own confession were open to question, since they depended upon acceptance of [a witness\u2019] testimony, whereas the incriminating confession of [the] codefendant ... was on videotape.\u201d 481 U.S. at 192, 107 S.Ct. at 1718. These same circumstances hold sway in this case. The officer was testifying from notes and memory regarding Pitt\u2019s statement. However, the codefendant\u2019s confession was recorded and, thus, was presented to the jury without any of the ambiguities and uncertainties of testimony which is dependent upon a witness\u2019 memory. The recorded statement eliminated any uncertainty that the jury might have otherwise entertained. Clearly, under these circumstances we cannot say the error in admitting the codefendant\u2019s statements was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"771\">*771</page-number>For these reasons, I would reverse Pitt\u2019s conviction and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b810-5\">. As stated above, I agree with Judge Elder\u2019s opinion that the statement made by the codefendant was hearsay. It was not admissible against Pitt because the statement did not satisfy Virginia's requirements for a statement against penal interest. However, I strongly disagree with Judge Elder's view that, for Confrontation Clause purposes, the codefendant\u2019s statement <em>could have been </em>admitted against Pitt.</p>\n<p id=\"b810-6\">When a statement against the penal interest of a declarant is also inculpatory as to a defendant, it can only be admitted in evidence in the criminal trial of the defendant when, additionally, it is proved to be trustworthy. <em>See Ellison v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 404, 408, 247 S.E.2d 685, 688 (1978); <em>Randolph v. Commonwealth, </em>24 Va.App. 345, 355, 482 S.E.2d 101, 106 (1997). <em>See also United States v. Rasmussen, </em>790 F.2d 55, 56 (8th Cir.1986); <em>United States v. Boyce, </em>849 F.2d 833, 836 (3d Cir.1988). In addition, when, as in this case, a statement does not fall within a firmly rooted exception to the hearsay rule, the Commonwealth bears the burden of establishing, for Confrontation Clause purposes, that the statement is cloaked with \"indicia of reliability,\u201d which means that the Commonwealth must make \"a showing of particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\u201d <em>Ohio v. Roberts, </em>448 U.S. 56, 66, 100 S.Ct. 2531, 2539, 65 L.Ed.2d 597 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-7\">In <em>Lee v. Illinois, </em>476 U.S. 530, 106 S.Ct. 2056, 90 L.Ed.2d 514 (1986), a codefendant's statement was offered by the prosecution in a joint trial as evidence only against the codefendant. However, the record established that the trial judge, in fact, considered the statement as evidence against Lee when convicting Lee. <em>Id. </em>at 538, 106 S.Ct. at 2060-61. The Supreme Court, in determining admissibility under the Confrontation Clause, considered not only whether the statement fell within a \"firmly rooted hearsay exception\u201d but also \"recognized that even if certain hearsay evidence does not fall within 'a firmly rooted hearsay exception' and is thus <em>presumptively unreliable and inadmissible for Confrontation Clause purposes, it may nonetheless meet Confrontation Clause reliability standards if it is supported by a \u2018showing of particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.' \u201d Id. </em>at 543, 106 S.Ct. at 2063 (citing <em>Roberts, </em>448 U.S. at 66, 100 S.Ct. at 2539) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b810-8\">In this case, there is no \"showing of particularized guarantees of trustworthiness,\u201d <em>id., </em>that would make the codefendant\u2019s statement admissible against Pitt under the second prong of the <em>Roberts </em>test. A very high standard must be met before a statement is deemed to be \"trustworthy\u201d under this second prong. In <em>Lee, </em>the Court stated that under the second prong, \"the [Confrontation] Clause countenances only hearsay marked with such trustworthiness that 'there is no material departure from the reason of the general [hearsay] rule.' \" <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). <em>See also People v. Watkins, </em>438 Mich. 627, 475 N.W.2d 727, 742 (1991) (analyzing <em>Lee, </em>the court reasoned that \u201cbecause [the statement in question in <em>Lee </em>] constituted accusatory hearsay contained in a codefendant confession, it was properly presumed at the outset to be <em>uniquely </em>and <em>especially </em>suspect and unreliable, much <em>more </em>so than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"767\">*767</page-number>typical, run-of-the-mill hearsay\u201d (emphasis in original)). Along similar lines, the Nebraska Supreme Court noted the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-6\">Unlike other exceptions to the hearsay rule, statements made in response to police interrogation generally do not have inherent guarantees of reliability and trustworthiness. For example, the spontaneity of an excited utterance reduces the risk of inaccuracies because the statement is not the result of a declarant's conscious effort to make a statement. On the other hand, a statement made by a person subject to criminal liability, in which the declarant incriminates a third party, may be the result of the declarant\u2019s motivation and opportunity to curry favor with the authorities.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b811-7\"><em>State </em>v. <em>Hughes, </em>244 Neb. 810, 510 N.W.2d 33, 38 (Neb.1993) (citations omitted). These and other cases strongly suggest that the statements made by the codefendant \"suffer from the classic indicia of unreliability affecting virtually all custodial codefendant confessions.\u201d <em>Watkins, </em>475 N.W.2d at 746.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-8\">In <em>Idaho v. Wright, </em>497 U.S. 805, 110 S.Ct. 3139, 111 L.Ed.2d 638 (1990), a child victim's statement was admitted as evidence against Wright. <em>Id. </em>at 809-12, 110 S.Ct. at 3143-45. The Supreme Court stated that \u201c[bjecause evidence possessing 'particularized guarantees of trustworthiness\u2019 must be <em>at least </em>as reliable as evidence admitted under a firmly rooted hearsay exception, ... we think that evidence admitted under the former requirement must similarly be so trustworthy that adversarial testing would add little to its reliability.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 821, 110 S.Ct. at 3149 (emphasis added). The Court gave an indication of what it considered <em>untrustworthy </em>by holding the statement under consideration in that case inadmissible because it was \"not made under circumstances of reliability comparable to those required, for example, for the admission of excited utterances or statements made for purposes of medical diagnosis or treatment.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 827, 110 S.Ct. at 3152.</p>\n<p id=\"b811-9\">Judge Elder correctly points out that one of the factors the United States Supreme Court held to be irrelevant in determining \u201ctrustworthiness\u201d as a basis for admissibility under the Confrontation Clause was whether the other evidence at trial corroborates the truth of the declarant\u2019s statement. <em>See Wright, </em>497 U.S. at 822-23, 110 S.Ct. at 3150-51. <em>See also Watkins, </em>475 N.W.2d at 745 (noting that \"the United States Supreme Court ... squarely prohibited reliance on corroborative evidence <em>of any kind </em>in assessing whether presumptively unreliable hearsay bears sufficient \u2018particularized guarantees of trustworthiness' for Confrontation Clause purposes.\" (emphasis added)); <em>Simmons </em>v. <em>State, </em>333 Md. 547, 636 A.2d 463, 470 (1994) (noting that \"the majority of the [Supreme] Court ... shot down its prior holdings that corroborating evidence could be used\u201d). The Court in <em>Wright </em>summarized the issue as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b811-10\">In short, the use of corroborating evidence to support a hearsay statement's \u201cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness\u201d would permit admission of a presumptively unreliable statement by bootstrapping on the trustworthiness of other evidence at trial, a result we think at odds with the requirement that hearsay evidence admitted under the Confrontation Clause be so trustworthy that cross-examination of the declarant would be of marginal utility----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b812-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"768\">*768</page-number>Moreover, although we considered in <em>Lee v. Illinois </em>the \u201cinterlocking\u201d nature of a codefendant\u2019s and a defendant's confessions to determine whether the codefendant\u2019s confession was sufficiently trustworthy for confrontation purposes, we decline to rely on corroborative physical evidence and indeed rejected the \"interlock\u201d theory in that case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b812-6\">497 U.S. at 823-24, 110 S.Ct. at 3150-51. The Court in <em>Wright </em>further observed that \"[t]he Court [in <em>Cruz\\ </em>said nothing about whether the codefendant's confession would be admissible against the defendant simply because it may have \u2018interlocked\u2019 with the defendant\u2019s confession.\u201d <em>Wright, </em>497 U.S. at 823 n. *, 110 S.Ct. at 3150, n. *.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-7\">In short, we must limit our review to the \"totality of circumstances <em>that surround the making of the [codefendant\u2019s] statement, </em>and that render the [codefendant] particularly worthy of belief.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 820, 110 S.Ct. at 3149 (emphasis added). The prosecution must provide an \"affirmative reason, arising from the circumstances in which the statement was made [that] provides a basis for rebutting the presumption that a hearsay statement is not worthy of reliance at trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 821, 110 S.Ct. at 3149-50.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-8\">In judging \"trustworthiness\u201d of the codefendant\u2019s statement, Judge Elder considers as a factor in this case \"the extent to which the [codefendant's] and the defendant's confessions \u2018interlock.\u2019 \u201d However, Pitt's statement was not recorded and was minimal in its content. The degree of interlock that can be discerned was not so substantial that the codefendant\u2019s statement can be deemed trustworthy by virtue of that circumstance. Significantly, in <em>Lee, </em>the Supreme Court expressly \"reject[ed] Illinois\u2019 second basis for establishing reliability, namely, that because Lee\u2019s and [the codefendant\u2019s] confessions \u2018interlock\u2019 on some points, [the codefendant's] confession should be deemed trustworthy in its entirety.\" 476 U.S. at 545, 106 S.Ct. at 2064. The reliance on this corroborating evidence runs counter to the expressed rulings of the Supreme Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b812-9\">Judge Elder also relies upon the circumstances of the police interrogation in judging \"trustworthiness.\u201d However, other courts generally consider as factors detracting from trustworthiness (1) whether the declarant was being questioned by the police, <em>Watkins, </em>475 N.W.2d at 746 (observing that the statements were \" \u2018given in response to the questions of police, who ... no doubt knew what they were looking for, and [they] w[ere] not tested in any manner by contemporaneous cross-examination by counsel....\u2019 \u201d), (2) \"whether the declarant was in police custody when the statement was made,\u201d <em>Hughes, </em>510 N.W.2d at 39, (3) \u201cwhether the declarant had a motive to mitigate his own criminal liability,\u201d <em>id., </em>and (4) \"whether the declarant made the statement in response to leading questions.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Additionally, when circumstances do not indicate that the declarant\u2019s statement \"was not motivated by a desire to carry favor with the ... police officer interrogating him\u201d and further prove that the declarant was the beneficiary of favorable recommendations from the authorities, the evidence tends to suggest that the statement is not trustworthy. <em>See United States v. Boyce, </em>849 F.2d 833, 836-37 (3rd Cir.1988). I believe these factors suggest that the codefendant\u2019s statement in this case should be deemed sufficiently untrustworthy as to be not admissible against Pitt.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"769\">*769</page-number>According to the codefendant\u2019s statement in this case, a discussion between Pitt and the victim concerning a \"rock\u201d of cocaine escalated to a wrestling struggle. The codefendant did not \"know if ... Pitt knew this guy or what.\u201d The codefendant denied \"trying to hurt no one or nothing like that.\u201d The codefendant also said that when \"the victim [began] getting the best of ... Pitt on the wrestling ... [, the codefendant] bumped into them to give ... Pitt an equal chance with the wrestling.\" Thus, while the codefendant implicates Pitt, he characterized his role in the incident as somewhat of a referee who intervened only to keep the victim from gaining a wrestling advantage over Pitt. Moreover, when the codefendant made this statement to the police, he did so knowing that the interrogating officer intended to inform the prosecutor and the magistrate that he, the codefendant, was fully cooperating with the police in their investigation. Nothing about the circumstances surrounding the making of the codefendant's statement tends to imbue it with an aura of trustworthiness.</p>\n<p id=\"b813-8\">Code \u00a7 19.2-262.1 permits codefendants to be tried jointly \"unless such joint trial would constitute prejudice to a defendant.\u201d The codefendant\u2019s statement was inadmissible against Pitt and would have been barred had Pitt been tried by himself. The only way the codefendant\u2019s statement could properly have been admitted into evidence was in the codefendant\u2019s trial. Thus, Pitt properly contends that he was \"prejudiced\u201d by a joint trial because evidence incriminating him was admitted that would have been inadmissible had the trials been separated.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
