The indictments followed a <em>nolle prosequi </em>in the general district court of warrants charging the identical offenses. Defendant complains on appeal that this procedure denied him a preliminary hearing on the original warrants in violation of Code \u00a7 19.2-218. Finding no error, we affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-14\">On July 17, 1996, defendant was arrested on warrants charging the instant offenses. A witness necessary to prosecution of the offenses was not present at the preliminary hearing in the general district court, and the Commonwealth successfully moved the court to <em>nolle prosequi </em>the charges. Thereafter, on September 9,1996, a grand jury directly indicted defendant for the same offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>Defendant moved the trial court to quash the indictments, arguing that the Commonwealth had pursued a procedural course which circumvented his statutory right to a preliminary hearing on the original arrest warrants. In denying the motion, the court found that a <em>nolle prosequi </em>of the warrants had been granted in accordance with Code \u00a7 19.2-265.3<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> and, therefore, defendant was not entitled to a preliminary hearing pursuant to Code \u00a7 19.2-218 because he was not \u201carrested on a charge of felony\u201d at the time of indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">It is well established that \u201c[w]hen the Commonwealth seeks to prosecute an adult for a felony, it has several options how to proceed, including direct indictment, presentment, information, or arrest warrant followed by a preliminary hearing\u201d in the general district court. <em>Burfoot v. Commonwealth, </em>23 Va.App. 38, 44, 473 S.E.2d 724, 728 (1996); <em>see </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-217, -218. The preliminary hearing which attends prosecution of an arrest warrant is \u201cessentially a screening process ... [to ascertain] whether there is reasonable ground to believe that the crime has been committed and ... the accused is the person who committed it.\u201d <em>Moore v. Commonwealth, </em>218 Va. 388, 391, 237 S.E.2d 187, 190 (1977) (citation omitted); <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 19.2-186. Similarly, direct indictment by a grand jury results from a finding of \u201cjust or probable cause\u201d that the accused committed a specified criminal offense. <em>See Britt v. Commonwealth, </em>202 Va. 906, 907, 121 S.E.2d 495, 496 (1961) (citation omitted); <em>see also </em>Code \u00a7\u00a7 19.2-191, -200, -202. Although neither a preliminary hearing nor an indictment is \u201cjurisdictional and constitutionally imposed,\u201d it is reversible error to deny such statutory rights whenever asserted by an accused. <em>Triplett v. Commonwealth, </em>212 Va. 649, 650-51, 186 S.E.2d 16, 17 (1972) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">An election by the Commonwealth to pursue a felony prosecution either by warrant and arrest or direct indictment has substantive procedural implications. \u201c \u2018[W]here an adult accused is directly indicted ..., without having been previous<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>ly arrested and charged, the jurisdiction of the circuit court is thereby invoked, and no preliminary hearing is required...\u2019\u201d <em>Burfoot, </em>23 Va.App. at 45, 473 S.E.2d at 728 (alteration in original) (citation omitted). Code \u00a7 19.2-218, however, directs that,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b454-7\">[n]o person who is arrested on a charge of felony shall be denied a preliminary hearing upon the question of whether there is reasonable ground to believe that he committed the offense and no indictment shall be returned in a court of record against any such person prior to such hearing unless such hearing is waived in writing by the accused.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">Defendant, therefore, reasons that his earlier arrest on felony warrants triggered the necessity of a preliminary hearing before an \u201cindictment shall be returned.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">Defendant\u2019s argument, however, is belied by the procedural history of the instant prosecution. The <em>nolle prosequi </em>of the original arrest warrants in the general district court \u201cterminated the ... charges, ... as if they had never existed. When the Commonwealth subsequently brought [the] new indictment[s], [they were] \u2018new charge[s], distinct from the original chargefs]....\u2019\u201d <em>Watkins v. Commonwealth, </em>27 Va. App. 473, 475, 499 S.E.2d 589, 590 (1998) <em>(en </em>banc) (quoting <em>Arnold v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 218, 221, 443 S.E.2d 183, <em>185, aff\u2019d en banc, </em>19 Va.App. 143, 450 S.E.2d 161 (1994)). Thus, \u201c \u2018the slate [was] wiped clean, and the situation [was] the same as if \u201cthe Commonwealth had chosen to make no charge.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 475, 499 S.E.2d at 590 (quoting <em>Burfoot, </em>23 Va.App. at 44, 473 S.E.2d at 727 (citation omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-12\">In construing former Code \u00a7 19.1-163.1, the predecessor to Code \u00a7 .19.2-218, the Supreme Court instructed that \u201c \u2018arrested\u2019 ... within this context [references] a person who is detained in custody by authority of law or one ... under a legal restraint.\u201d <em>Moore, </em>218 Va. at 394, 237 S.E.2d at 192 (rejecting argument that the <em>only </em>route to indictment after arrest is through preliminary hearing). An accused \u201cwhose freedom of movement and liberty is not subject to any legal restriction, certainly is not a person who \u2018is arrested on a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>charge of felony\u2019 \u201d within the intendment of Code \u00a7 19.2-218. <em>Id. </em>at 394, 237 S.E.2d at 192. Therefore, direct indictment of an accused not then arrested for such offense is neither \u201cmanipulative [nor] ... a denial of any statutory right to which the defendant was entitled.\u201d <em>Waye v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 683, 689, 251 S.E.2d 202, 206, <em>cert. denied, </em>442 U.S. 924, 99 S.Ct. 2850, 61 L.Ed.2d 292 (1979) (citation omitted); <em>see also Moore, </em>218 Va. at 394, 237 S.E.2d at 192; <em>Land v. Commonwealth, </em>211 Va. 223, 224-25, 176 S.E.2d 586, 587-88 (1970); <em>Seibert v. Commonwealth, </em>22 Va.App. 40, 43-44, 467 S.E.2d 838, 840 (1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">Accordingly, upon <em>nolle prosequi </em>of the offenses charged in the original warrants, defendant was no longer \u201carrested on a charge of felony\u201d contemplated by Code \u00a7 19.2-218 and was thereafter properly indicted without the benefit of a preliminary hearing. We, therefore, affirm the convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b453-7\">. Defendant does not take issue with this finding on appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
