For the following reasons, we affirm the DUI conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">On November 21, 1996, Virginia State Game Warden D.W. Herndon received a dispatch regarding a possible intoxicated driver on Turner Run Road in George Washington National Forest. When Herndon arrived at the specified location, he observed a Ford pickup truck driven by appellant. He followed the truck for approximately two to three miles and observed appellant stop at an intersection, make a wide right turn, and force an oncoming vehicle off the road. Appellant was stopped and, after failing two of four field sobriety tests, was arrested for driving under the influence of alcohol.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">Herndon advised appellant of the implied consent law. Appellant requested a breath test and was taken to the Rocking-ham County Jail. During the administration of the test, the breathalyzer malfunctioned. Appellant was offered a blood test, which he refused. Herndon took appellant before a magistrate who again explained the implied consent law, and appellant again refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">Evidence at trial established that the same model breathalyzer machine was located at the Harrisonburg Police Department (HPD), which was down the street from the Rockingham County Jail. However, Deputy Richard Getz, the breathalyzer operator at the jail, stated he had <em>never </em>used the HPD breathalyzer and it was not standard operating procedure to use it. Getz also testified he had never heard of any of the Rockingham deputies going to the HPD to use that breathaly<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"591\">*591</page-number>zer. Instead, if the jail breathalyzer malfunctioned, the next step was to administer a blood test. A nurse was on duty at the jail and ready to administer the blood test to appellant.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">At the conclusion of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, appellant moved to strike the evidence, contending the Commonwealth failed to meet its burden to establish a valid reason for the unavailability of the breath test requested by appellant. The trial court overruled appellant\u2019s motion and convicted him of driving under the influence, first offense, in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-266.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2(B) provides that any person arrested for driving under the influence \u201cshall submit to a breath test. If the breath test is unavailable ... a blood test shall be given.\u201d Appellant concedes that the breathalyzer at the jail malfunctioned; however, he argues that the breath test was still \u201cavailable\u201d within the meaning of Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2(B) because another breathalyzer was available at the HPD, which was located within one block of the jail. Appellant argues the Commonwealth failed to make a \u201creasonable effort to comply with [the statute]\u201d by transporting him to the other police station and, therefore, the charge should have been dismissed. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">The Commonwealth bears the burden of establishing that the breath test appellant requested was unavailable. Furthermore, the Commonwealth must provide a reasonable explanation for its unavailability. <em>See Breeden v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 148, 151, 421 S.E.2d 674, 676 (1992); <em>see also Mason v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 583, 585, 425 S.E.2d 544, 545 (1993) (decided under former version of Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2(B)). In <em>Breeden, </em>the defendant requested a blood test from a local hospital but was told by officers that no one was available at the hospital to administer the test. No officers checked with the hospital to determine whether such a test could be given. We held the Commonwealth failed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"592\">*592</page-number>establish why the blood test was unavailable within the meaning of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\">Similarly, in <em>Sullivan v. Commonwealth, </em>17 Va.App. 376, 437 S.E.2d 242 (1993), the defendant was told by officers that the <em>only </em>test available to her was a breath test. However, the evidence established that a blood test was available twenty-four hours each day at a local hospital down the street and that the police used the hospital <em>regularly </em>for the drawing of blood. We held in that case the blood test was \u201cavailable\u201d within the meaning of the statute and defendant was entitled to elect which test would be performed.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">This case is distinguishable from both <em>Breeden </em>and <em>Sullivan. </em>Unlike <em>Breeden, </em>Deputy Getz began to administer the breath test requested by appellant and did not attempt to hinder appellant\u2019s election of which test to employ. Contrary to appellant\u2019s argument that a breathalyzer was available at the HPD and that his case is controlled by <em>Sullivan, </em>no evidence was presented that the Rockingham jail officers used that machine on a regular basis or on any prior occasion.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">We believe the instant case is controlled by <em>Commonwealth v. Gray, </em>248 Va. 633, 449 S.E.2d 807 (1994), decided subsequent to both <em>Breeden </em>and <em>Sullivan, </em>in which the Supreme Court affirmed defendant\u2019s refusal conviction. In that case, the sheriffs department did not have a licensed breathalyzer operator on duty at the time of defendant\u2019s arrest. In reviewing the department\u2019s procedures, the Court wrote:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b636-7\">The reasonableness of the Commonwealth\u2019s explanation is determined from a review of all the facts, and courts must subject these facts to particular scrutiny when \u201coffice procedures\u201d are cited in support of an assertion that one test was unavailable at the time of defendant\u2019s arrest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b636-8\"><em>Id. </em>at 636, 449 S.E.2d at 809. According to department procedures in <em>Gray, </em>when no officer was on duty to administer a breath test, a blood test was to be given. The Court concluded that the Commonwealth provided a reasonable explanation as to the unavailability of the breath test. <em>See id. </em>at 636-37, 449 S.E.2d at 810; <em>see also Mason, </em>15 Va.App. at 585, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>425 S.E.2d at 545 (concluding that a blood test was \u201cunavailable\u201d where officer was the only officer on duty and the nearest hospital was in a neighboring jurisdiction).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-5\">In the instant case, the officers attempted to provide appellant with the breath test as requested. When the machine malfunctioned, it became unavailable within the meaning of the statute. The Commonwealth is not required to search the surrounding areas for an otherwise available machine. No evidence was presented that a qualified operator was on duty at the HPD or that the deputies from the jail were allowed to use the machine at the police department. Because the breath test could not be successfully completed, it was unavailable, and the Commonwealth provided a reasonable explanation for its unavailability. <em>See Walker v. City of Lynchburg, </em>22 Va.App. 197, 468 S.E.2d 164 (1996) (holding that a blood test was unavailable when the laboratory technician was unable to draw defendant\u2019s blood after three attempts).</p>\n<p id=\"b637-6\">Accordingly, we affirm appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b637-7\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b634-10\">. Appellant was also convicted of refusal to take a blood or breath test in violation of Code \u00a7 18.2-268.2, which is not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
