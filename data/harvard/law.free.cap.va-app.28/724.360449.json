The sole issue raised is whether the evidence established a reasonable, articulable suspicion upon which to stop appellant. Finding the evidence sufficient, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-10\">The faets are undisputed. On February 6, 1997 between 1:00 p.m. and 2:00 p.m., Trooper J.L. Turner (Turner) and two other officers were conducting a roadblock at the intersection of Routes 606 and 674 in Henry County. Traffic was \u201clight.\u201d There was a knoll on the road north of the roadblock, and a driver travelling south could not see the roadblock until the vehicle came to the top of the knoll.</p>\n<p id=\"b769-11\">As Turner looked north from the roadblock, he saw appellant\u2019s vehicle reach the top of the knoll, \u201cstop suddenly,\u201d and turn right into the driveway of a private residence approximately 50-75 yards (150-225 feet) from the roadblock. Turner stated that appellant drove slowly into the driveway as if hesitant about stopping there and he continued to look at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>Turner. As appellant stepped out of the vehicle, he continued to look at Turner and the other two troopers.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b770-5\">Turner walked toward appellant, who knocked on the front door of the residence and then walked back toward his vehicle. Turner approached appellant and asked him for his \u201cdriver\u2019s permit.\u201d Appellant stated that it was in his car and he went to retrieve it. He gave Turner a Virginia identification card rather than a driver\u2019s license. Turner said, \u201cYou\u2019re on a suspended license,\u201d and appellant responded, \u201cNo, I\u2019m an habitual offender.\u201d Turner then placed appellant in his patrol car and ran a DMV check, which verified that appellant was an habitual offender.</p>\n<p id=\"b770-6\">Turner testified that at the time he first saw appellant he was committing no traffic violation. Additionally, appellant did not attempt to make a U-turn to avoid the roadblock. Rather, Turner testified that \u201c[t]he only reason I approached [appellant] in the first place was his suspicious way he was going through the driveway and kept looking at me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b770-7\">Appellant was charged with driving after having been declared an habitual offender, second offense, in violation of Code \u00a7 46.2-857. In denying appellant\u2019s pretrial motion to suppress, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b770-8\">In this situation ... [appellant\u2019s] vehicle immediately came to a stop and then in a very hesitant fashion turned into a private driveway at the same time, according to the trooper, the [appellant] is basically keeping his eye on the police officers, goes up and knocks on the door. While he\u2019s knocking on the door, he\u2019s still watching the State Troopers. It\u2019s my feeling the trooper in this case had reasonable <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>articulable suspicion and had the perfect right to go up and see what was going on.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b771-6\">Accordingly, the trial court found appellant guilty as charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-7\">When the police stop a vehicle and detain its occupants, the action constitutes a \u201cseizure\u201d of the person for Fourth Amendment purposes. <em>See Delaware v. Prouse, </em>440 U.S. 648, 653, 99 S.Ct. 1391, 1395-96, 59 L.Ed.2d 660 (1979); <em>Zimmerman v. Commonwealth, </em>234 Va. 609, 611, 363 S.E.2d 708, 709 (1988). If the stop of the vehicle is without a warrant, the Commonwealth has the burden to prove the stop was legal. <em>See Coolidge v. New Hampshire, </em>403 U.S. 443, 454-55, 91 S.Ct. 2022, 2032, 29 L.Ed.2d 564 (1971); <em>Simmons v. Commonwealth, </em>238 Va. 200, 204, 380 S.E.2d 656, 659 (1989). Any warrantless stop of a vehicle which leads to an arrest of its occupants requires probable cause to believe that a crime has been committed. <em>See Prouse, </em>440 U.S. at 654 n. 10, 99 S.Ct. at 1396 n. 10. However, if an officer has an \u201carticulable and reasonable suspicion that a motorist is unlicensed or that an automobile is not registered, or that either the vehicle or an occupant is otherwise subject to seizure for violation of the law,\u201d the officer may conduct an investigatory stop of the vehicle limited in time and scope to ascertaining whether the suspicions are accurate. <em>Id. </em>at 663, 99 S.Ct. at 1401; <em>Berkemer v. McCarty, </em>468 U.S. 420, 439-40, 104 S.Ct. 3138, 3150, 82 L.Ed.2d 317 (1984); <em>Zimmerman, </em>234 Va. at 611, 363 S.E.2d at 709.</p>\n<p id=\"b771-8\">In the present case, appellant was seized within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment when Turner approached and asked for appellant\u2019s driver\u2019s license. <em>See Thomas v. Commonwealth, </em>24 Va.App. 49, 55-56, 480 S.E.2d 135, 138 (1997) <em>(en </em>banc); <em>Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>17 Va.App. 694, 695, 440 S.E.2d 619, 620 (1994). However, at the time of the seizure, Turner had a reasonable basis for believing that appellant was evading the roadblock. <em>See Commonwealth v. Eaves, </em>13 Va.App. 162, 408 S.E.2d 925 (1991); <em>Stroud v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 633, 636, 370 S.E.2d 721, 723 (1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b772-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"728\">*728</page-number>In <em>Stroud, </em>we held that a police officer had a reasonable, articulable suspicion of wrongdoing when he observed the defendant make a U-turn within 100-150 feet of a police roadblock. <em>See Stroud, </em>6 Va.App. at 636, 370 S.E.2d at 723. The officer testified that based upon his eleven years of experience with the state police he suspected from the driver\u2019s conduct that he was attempting to avoid the roadblock because he was either unlicensed or otherwise in violation of the law. <em>See id. </em>at 634-35, 370 S.E.2d at 722.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-5\">Likewise, in <em>Eaves, </em>the officer observed the defendant make a U-turn approximately 100 feet to 1/10 mile before the traffic checkpoint. The officer testified that the defendant was traveling in the left southbound lane when \u201call of a sudden\u201d he engaged his turn signal at a deceleration lane, made a U-turn, and headed back in the opposite direction from the roadblock. <em>See Eaves, </em>13 Va.App. at 165, 408 S.E.2d at 927. The deceleration lane was only about 35-40 feet long. The officer described the turn of the vehicle as \u201cabrupt,\u201d \u201cimmediate,\u201d and \u201cquick.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We concluded that the officer\u2019s observations gave him a reasonable, articulable suspicion to stop the defendant. <em>See id. </em>at 166, 408 S.E.2d at 927-28.</p>\n<p id=\"b772-6\">In the instant case, appellant\u2019s conduct produced at least as much reasonable suspicion of possible criminal activity as that involved in <em>Stroud </em>and <em>Eaves </em>and was sufficient to support Turner\u2019s stop of appellant. As Turner looked north from the roadblock, he saw appellant\u2019s vehicle reach the top of the knoll, \u201cstop suddenly,\u201d and turn right into the driveway of a private residence. Turner described appellant\u2019s behavior as \u201creal hesitant,\u201d \u201cslow to stop,\u201d \u201cgoing real slow,\u201d \u201clike he was real hesitant about stopping in the driveway.\u201d Moreover, appellant \u201cstarted easing up into the driveway ... looking at [Turner] at all times.\u201d We find that this evidence gave Turner reasonable suspicion that appellant turned to avoid the roadblock because he was unlicensed or otherwise in violation of the law. <em>Murphy v. Commonwealth, </em>9 Va.App. 139, 384 S.E.2d 125 (1989), relied on by appellant, is distinguishable from this case. We held in <em>Murphy </em>that a legal right turn onto a dead-end road with a roadblock in view, <em>without more, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"729\">*729</page-number>did not give police reasonable suspicion to suspect the defendant of criminal misconduct. <em>See id. </em>at 141, 384 S.E.2d at 126. Appellant argues that like the driver in <em>Murphy, </em>his actions in making a right turn into a private driveway 50-75 yards ahead of the roadblock did not give Turner a reasonable suspicion that criminal activity may have occurred or been occurring. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">In <em>Murphy, </em>the officer observed the defendant make a <em>\u201cnormal </em>and legal\u201d right turn onto a dead-end street approximately 350 feet before a checkpoint. <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added). The officer acknowledged that nothing distinguished the operation of the defendant\u2019s vehicle from that of any other driver attempting to make a right turn. <em>See id. </em>Unlike the situation in <em>Murphy </em>where no suspicious circumstances existed apart from a lawful turn into an existing roadway, Turner observed factors which <em>\u201cindependently raise[d] suspicion of criminal activity </em>\u201d and suggested that appellant made the turn into the private residence to evade the roadblock. <em>Id. </em>at 145, 384 S.E.2d at 128 (emphasis added). Turner described appellant\u2019s car as \u201cstop[ping] suddenly\u201d when it reached the top of the knoll. Additionally, appellant \u201cslowly\u201d turned into the driveway while constantly keeping his eyes on Turner. Under the circumstances of this case, we hold that Turner possessed a reasonable suspicion that appellant\u2019s purpose in turning was to avoid the roadblock because he was unlicensed or involved in criminal activity. Accordingly, we affirm appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b770-9\">. Specifically, Trooper Turner testified that \u201c[t]he vehicle was kind of real hesitant about going in the driveway. I can remember that. It was real slow to stop. As he was turning in the driveway, I was watching the vehicle and the driver, and the driver kept looking toward me. He was going real slow, like he was real hesitant about stopping at the driveway.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
