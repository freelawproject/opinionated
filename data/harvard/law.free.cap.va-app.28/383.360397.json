Employer contends the commission erred when it concluded that the supporting documentation filed with employer\u2019s application failed to establish probable cause to believe employer\u2019s claims were meritorious. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-10\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-11\">FACTS</p>\n<p id=\"b428-12\">In 1994, claimant suffered a compensable back injury. Claimant and employer subsequently executed a memorandum of agreement providing claimant with medical and temporary total disability benefits. Employer compensated claimant pursuant to their agreement until September 30, 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-13\">On September 30, 1997, employer filed an application alleging a change in condition with the commission. In the application, employer requested the suspension of claimant\u2019s benefits <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>on two grounds: (1) \u201c[claimant\u2019s] current disability is unrelated to the industrial accident,\u201d and (2) \u201c[c]laimant has been removed from the job market for reasons unrelated to his compensable accident.\u201d In support of its first ground of relief, employer designated a letter from Dr. Bruce I. Tetalman, claimant\u2019s treating physician for pain management but not his back injury. In the letter, dated July 24, 1997, Dr. Tetalman stated that claimant\u2019s work-related injury had reached maximum medical improvement and that he \u201ccan work in above sedentary capacity.\u201d Dr. Tetalman set forth several restrictions for any work performed by claimant. Dr. Tetalman also noted that claimant \u201cappears to have apparent psychiatric problems that are unrelated to the work injury and that may impact upon his ability to work at these capacities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">Regarding its second ground of relief, employer designated a letter from Joyce W. Conner, a vocational counselor for CorVel Corporation, as the supporting documentation. In her letter, dated September 2, 1997, Ms. Conner stated that employer had contacted her regarding claimant. She stated that they previously had concluded \u201cit would not be reasonable to pursue vocational rehabilitation placement efforts for [claimant] based on his unrelated psychiatric condition.\u201d She stated she recently spoke to an employer who stated \u201cthey might possibly be able to consider [claimant]\u201d if his work hours were increased. Ms. Conner concluded her letter by stating \u201cit is unfortunate that [claimant] is unable to participate actively in job search placement efforts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b429-5\">A senior claims examiner found no probable cause justifying a suspension of claimant\u2019s benefits and refused to docket employer\u2019s application for a hearing. Employer appealed the claims examiner\u2019s determination, and the full commission affirmed. The commission reasoned that, even if claimant\u2019s psychiatric problems were unrelated to his compensable injury, none of employer\u2019s supporting documentation tended to prove that claimant\u2019s continuing disability was unrelated to his compensable injury or that claimant had refused to participate in vocational rehabilitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-4\">PROBABLE CAUSE TO JUSTIFY HEARING EMPLOYER\u2019S APPLICATION</p>\n<p id=\"b430-5\">Employer argues that the commission erred when it concluded that the letters written by Dr. Tetalman and Ms. Conner were insufficient to establish probable cause that either of its grounds for relief was meritorious. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b430-6\">This case involves the application of the commission\u2019s prehearing procedural rules. Under Commission Rule 1.4(A) and (B), an employer\u2019s application for hearing based upon a change in condition must be in writing and under oath and must state the grounds for relief and the date for which compensation was last paid. In addition, the employer must designate and send to the employee copies of the documentation supporting its application. <em>See </em>Commission Rule 1.4(A). Under Commission Rule 1.5(A), the commission is required to review the employer\u2019s application for compliance with the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act and the commission\u2019s rules. At this preliminary stage, whether an employer is entitled to a suspension of benefits and to a hearing on the merits of its application hinge upon whether its application is \u201ctechnically acceptable.\u201d <em>See </em>Commission Rule 1.5(C).</p>\n<p id=\"b430-7\">The decisions of the commission since Rules 1.4 and 1.5 became effective in 1994 indicate it has interpreted its prehearing procedural rules to include a test that previously was stated expressly in its former Rule 13. An employer\u2019s application for hearing will be deemed not \u201ctechnically acceptable\u201d and will be rejected unless the employer\u2019s designated supporting documentation is sufficient to support a finding of probable cause to believe the employer\u2019s grounds for relief are meritorious.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See, e.g., Mixon v. Bay Area Movers &amp; Storage, Inc., </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>VWC File No. 169-52-56 (Va. Workers\u2019 Comp. Comm\u2019n Apr. 21, 1997); <em>Robinson v. Dynalectric, </em>VWC File No. 170-12-48 (Va. Workers\u2019 Comp. Comm\u2019n June 13, 1996); <em>Sadoff v. Mary\u2019s Flower Shop, </em>VWC File No. 167-44-65 (Va. Workers\u2019 Comp. Comm\u2019n Apr. 19, 1995); <em>Graham v. Consolidated Stores Corp., </em>VWC File No. 161-81-78 (Va. Workers\u2019 Comp. Comm\u2019n Sept. 29, 1994).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The commission has defined the standard of \u201cprobable cause\u201d as \u201c[a] reasonable ground for belief in the existence of facts warranting the proceeding complained of.\u201d <em>Mixon, </em>VWC File No. 169-52-56 (quoting <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>1081 (5th ed.1979)).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-4\">Applying these rules to this case, we hold that the commission did not err when it affirmed the claims examiner\u2019s conclusion that the supporting documentation designated by employer was insufficient to support a finding of probable cause to believe that either of employer\u2019s grounds for relief was meritorious. First, Dr. Tetalman\u2019s letter of July 24, 1997 does not support employer\u2019s allegation that claimant\u2019s \u201ccurrent disability is unrelated to the industrial accident.\u201d In fact, Dr. Tetalman\u2019s opinion supports the opposite conclusion. He opined that claimant was still partially disabled and that this disability was \u201c[biased on the work-related injury.\u201d Although the doctor also opined that claimant \u201cappears to have apparent psychiatric problems that are unrelated to the work injury,\u201d nothing in his letter tends to prove that these psychiatric problems prevented claimant from returning to light duty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>employment. Instead, the doctor merely opined that these problems \u201cmay impact\u201d claimant\u2019s ability to work. It is well established that \u201c[a] medical opinion based on a \u2018possibility\u2019 is irrelevant [and] purely speculative.\u201d <em>Spruill v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 475, 479, 271 S.E.2d 419, 421 (1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">In addition, Ms. Conner\u2019s letter failed to provide any evidentiary support for employer\u2019s allegation that \u201c[claimant has been removed from the job market for reasons unrelated to his compensable accident.\u201d Although Ms. Conner stated \u201cit would not be reasonable to pursue vocational rehabilitation placement efforts for [claimant] based on his unrelated psychiatric condition,\u201d her letter does not indicate how she could competently conclude that claimant\u2019s \u201cpsychiatric problems\u201d prevented him from participating in vocational rehabilitation. Even if Ms. Conner had read Dr. Tetalman\u2019s letter, the doctor\u2019s letter provided no support for the conclusion that claimant\u2019s psychiatric problems <em>actually affected </em>his ability to work at the restricted level approved by the doctor. Furthermore, none of employer\u2019s designated supporting documentation indicated the nature of claimant\u2019s psychiatric problems. The commission held that it could not accept a vocational rehabilitation worker\u2019s opinion as medical evidence of claimant\u2019s psychological condition. Regardless of her qualifications to render such an opinion, Ms. Conner could not have assessed the disabling effect of claimant\u2019s unknown psychiatric problems on his fitness for vocational rehabilitation without resorting to speculation regarding the nature of these problems. Furthermore, credible evidence supports the commission\u2019s finding that \u201c[u]ntil vocational rehabilitation is actually offered to the claimant, he has not refused to participate in vocational rehabilitation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the decision of the commission.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b430-8\">.
