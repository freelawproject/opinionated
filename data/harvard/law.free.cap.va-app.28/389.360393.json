For the reasons that follow, we reverse and remand the case to the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">\n<em>BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b434-10\">Richardson, a juvenile, pleaded guilty in the Spotsylvania County Juvenile and Domestic Relations District Court (juvenile court) to two probation violations and was adjudicated delinquent on May 29, 1997. On June 11, 1997, the juvenile court committed him to the Department of Juvenile Justice (DJJ). He did not appeal that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-11\">In the June 11, 1997 order, the juvenile court scheduled a commitment review hearing for August 7, 1997, and stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-12\">[The] Court will strongly consider releasing George from the commitment if he is in compliance with all requirements of Department of Juvenile Justice and is doing well.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-15\">At the August 7, 1997 review hearing, the juvenile court declined to rescind the commitment. On August 18, 1997,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Richardson appealed that judgment to the Spotsylvania County Circuit Court (trial court). On September 15, 1997, the trial court dismissed the appeal as untimely, holding that the June 11, 1997 commitment order, not the August 7 order, was the appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>II.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">\n<em>JURISDICTION OF CIRCUIT COURT</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">Richardson contends that the trial court erred in ruling that a juvenile court\u2019s judgment in a commitment review hearing is not appealable. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-7\">Code \u00a7 16.1-289, entitled \u201cReview of order of commitment,\u201d provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b435-8\">The juvenile court or the circuit court, as the case may be, of its own motion may reopen any case and may modify or revoke its order. The juvenile court or the circuit court shall before modifying or revoking such order grant a hearing after notice in writing to the complainant, if any, and to the person or agency having custody of the child; provided, however, that this section shall not apply in the case of a child committed to the Department [of Juvenile Justice] after sixty days from the date of the order of commitment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b435-9\">Code \u00a7 16.1-289 permits a trial court to review <em>sua sponte </em>the commitment of a juvenile. The trial court, in its discretion, may revoke, modify or continue the commitment. The only statutory limitations on such proceedings are as follows: (1) the trial court cannot revoke or modify a commitment after sixty days from the date of the order of commitment; and (2) the trial court must provide written notice of the hearing to the complainant, if any, and. to the person or agency having custody of the child.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-10\">A commitment review is not a re-examination of the underlying order of delinquency or commitment. The delinquency or commitment order is a final order for purposes of appeal pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-296. A commitment review permits the trial court to evaluate the utility of continuing the commitment in the light of post-commitment developments and circumstances. Such an assessment is consistent with the juvenile law\u2019s paramount concern with the welfare of the child and family, the safety of the community, and protection of the rights of victims. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 16.1-227. A commitment review <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>order revoking, modifying or continuing the commitment is a final, appealable order as to the decision whether to revoke, modify or continue the commitment.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">The right of appeal from a juvenile court is set forth in Code \u00a7 16.1-296. <em>See Walker v. Dept. of Public Welfare, </em>223 Va. 557, 562, 290 S.E.2d 887, 890 (1982). Code \u00a7 16.1-296(A) provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b436-6\">From any final order or judgment of the juvenile court affecting the rights or interests of any person coming within its jurisdiction, an appeal may be taken within ten days from the entry of a final judgment, order or conviction.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Acr\">This statutory language makes plain that the appellate jurisdiction of the circuit court encompasses \u201cany final order\u201d of the juvenile court. The juvenile court\u2019s August 7, 1997 order was a final order.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">An order determining whether to modify, revoke or continue a juvenile\u2019s commitment following a review hearing pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-289, is final because it concludes that issue and \u201c \u2018leaves nothing to be done by the court.\u2019 \u201d <em>Hairfield v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va.App. 649, 655, 376 S.E.2d 796, 799 (1989) (citations omitted) (juvenile transfer orders are \u201cfinal\u201d). <em>See Alexander v. Morgan, </em>19 Va.App. 538, 540, 452 S.E.2d 370, 371-72 (1995). That issue is separate and distinct from the issues determining the original finding of delinquency and the commitment order.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">The term \u201cany\u201d in Code \u00a7 16.1-296(A) is neither limited nor qualified. <em>Cox v. Cox, </em>16 Va.App. 146, 148, 428 S.E.2d 515, 516 (1993). We note that Code \u00a7 16.1-296(E) requires that an adult\u2019s appeal from conviction of an offense within the jurisdiction of the juvenile and domestic relations district court shall be treated as an appeal from a general district court. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 16.1-136. Code \u00a7 16.1-296(E) provides that the procedures for appealing a charge of non-support are governed by Code \u00a7 20-61, <em>et seq. </em>Code \u00a7 16.1-285.2, governing release and review hearings for serious offenders, states expressly that \u201c[t]he order of the court shall be final and not subject to appeal.\u201d Code \u00a7 16.1-285.2(D). By contrast, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>language in Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-289 and 16.1-296 neither limits a juvenile\u2019s right to appeal a commitment review order nor states that such an order is not appealable.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">The Commonwealth misapprehends the basis for Richardson\u2019s appeal, arguing that it was barred because Richardson did not timely appeal the order of commitment. Richardson appealed the juvenile court\u2019s August 7,1997 decision to continue his commitment. He did not, and could not on August 18, 1997, appeal the June 11, 1997 order of commitment, because the statutory time for appealing that order had run. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 16.1-296(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">Because the August 7, 1997 order was appealable, we reverse and remand the case to the trial court to consider Richardson\u2019s appeal with respect to the issues determined by that order.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b434-16\">. August 17, 1997 was a Sunday. See Code \u00a7 1-13.3:1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
