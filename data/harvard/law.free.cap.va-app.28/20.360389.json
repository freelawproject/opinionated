On appeal, he contended the trial court erroneously denied his motion to suppress the cocaine and held the evidence sufficient to prove he intended to distribute the cocaine. A divided panel of this Court reversed and dismissed the conviction, holding the cocaine upon which his conviction was based was discovered as the result of an unreasonable seizure of his person, in violation of the Fourth Amendment. <em>See Welshman v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 599, 491 S.E.2d 294 (1997). Upon rehearing <em>en banc, </em>we hold the trial court properly denied appellant\u2019s motion to suppress and the evidence is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>sufficient to prove appellant intended to distribute the cocaine. Accordingly, we affirm his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-5\">During June 1995, Investigator Thomas of the Lynchburg Police Department conducted ongoing surveillance in the 2100 block of Main Street, which was known as an open-air drug market. Between January 1994 and August 11, 1995, the police \u201chad [703] calls in the [2100] block of Main Street,\u201d 136 of which were for drug offenses. Sixty-eight of the drug offense calls directly involved the residence at 2110 Main Street, which was a reputed crack house. Police also received seventeen \u201cshots fired\u201d calls for that block during the same period.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-6\">On June 29, 1995, Investigator Thomas used binoculars to observe two individuals engaging in hand-to-hand transactions with drivers and pedestrians in the 2100 block of Main Street. He saw those two individuals carry white chunks of what appeared to be crack cocaine in their hands and exchange the chunks for cash. He believed the two were selling cocaine. Appellant, along with about seven other people, had been standing in front of the residence at 2110 Main Street for at least fifteen minutes, but appellant was not visibly involved in any of the apparent drug transactions.</p>\n<p id=\"b70-7\">Investigator Thomas radioed his observations to a team of four officers, including Officer Duff, who approached the scene to apprehend the two individuals suspected of selling cocaine. It was about 8:25 p.m. and \u201cwas just barely light outside.\u201d When Investigator Thomas radioed the team, the two target individuals were \u201cin the middle of the street ... making a transaction\u201d with a \u201cstopped ... vehicle.\u201d However, \u201cwhen the officers began approaching in their vehicle[,] both individuals ran back into [the] little group where [appellant] was.\u201d This group was on the sidewalk area in front of 2110 Main Street, between the front porch and a van with its doors open parked in front of the residence. Four or five people, \u201cmale and female and some children,\u201d were on the front porch of the residence, and about three people were inside the van. In addition, \u201c[t]here were other pedestrians within the block.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"27\">*27</page-number>Investigator Thomas testified that the officers \u201calways want to outnumber the individuals we\u2019re getting out with, but in some cases we can\u2019t do it.\u201d The officers \u201celected to go in with what they had,\u201d but upon arriving at the scene, Officer Duff called for additional officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b71-5\">\u201cDue to the nature and reputation of the area and [Officer Duffs] experience with the area, and, also some of the people that [he] had observed there,\u201d he decided to direct everyone on the sidewalk at the scene to he \u201cin a prone position momentarily\u201d for the safety of the officers and the civilians. Duff also wanted to apprehend the target subjects before they had a chance to dispose of any cocaine they may have possessed. The officers intended to secure the two target individuals and the scene \u201ceither by having people leave or making sure that ... the people [who] decided to stay\u201d had no weapons. Duff previously had seen a pellet gun in the mailbox of the residence, which was located only three to four feet from where appellant was standing, and in the possession of one of the occupants of the residence. He also was aware of several prior \u201cshots fired\u201d calls involving that residence and knew police previously had seen an individual firing a weapon in front of that residence. The 2100 block \u201cwas known as a high crime, very volatile area.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b71-6\">As the officers were exiting the car, Officer Duff told everyone on the sidewalk, including appellant, to get on the ground and extend their arms out from their bodies. He said he would have allowed anyone other than the target individuals to leave the scene, but he did not inform them of this option. Everyone complied with Officer Duffs directive. While other officers secured the target subjects, Officer Duff noticed appellant had not extended his arms as directed and instead had kept them under his torso. Fearing appellant was reaching for a weapon, Duff \u201cimmediately went to [appellant]\u201d and again told him to extend his arms. As Duff began to roll appellant over, appellant complied by extending his arms. Duff saw nothing in the area where appellant had been lying but was concerned about the officers\u2019 safety and frisked appellant for weapons. When he patted the exterior of appel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>lant\u2019s left front pants pocket, he detected an object that \u201cfelt like several smaller objects that were hard and it felt like ... they were wrapped in some type of baggy-type wrap.\u201d Without manipulating the contents of appellant\u2019s pocket, Duff immediately concluded the objects were crack cocaine. He then pulled from appellant\u2019s pocket a piece of a brown paper bag containing five or six chunks of crack cocaine weighing 1.44 grams. Other than appellant and the target individuals, police did not frisk anyone else at the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-5\">In a search of appellant incident to arrest, the officers found $150 in cash, comprised of five $20 bills and one $50 bill. They found no devices for ingesting cocaine in appellant\u2019s possession. After <em>Mirandizing </em>appellant, Officer Duff asked him if he smoked crack cocaine. Appellant said, \u201cDo I look like I smoke cocaine?\u201d When Duff replied, \u201cNo,\u201d appellant said, \u201cAll right then.\u201d Appellant said he was not holding the cocaine for anyone else and denied having an intent to sell it.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-6\">At trial, Officer Duff qualified as an expert and testified appellant\u2019s possession of 1.44 grams of crack cocaine was inconsistent with possession for personal use. He testified that crack cocaine was commonly sold in the Lynchburg area in $20 and $40 rocks and that one gram of cocaine would cost $150 to $175. Investigator Thomas testified that, in his experience, people selling cocaine commonly carry several rocks in pieces of brown paper or small pieces of cellophane, plastic wrappers or plastic bags. Purchasers, by contrast, he testified, \u201cusually just get the rock and leave.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b72-7\">Appellant moved to suppress, contending the seizure of his person and the subsequent pat-down search and removal of the cocaine from his pocket violated the United States and Virginia Constitutions. The trial court denied the motion to suppress, finding \u201cthe police officers in the case acted properly and had reasonable probability or reasonable basis to believe that the area involved was very dangerous; that it was a high crime area.\u201d As a result, he held the officers\u2019 \u201cactions were reasonable.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b73-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"29\">*29</page-number>At trial, appellant moved to strike the Commonwealth\u2019s evidence, but the trial court denied the motion and convicted appellant of possessing cocaine with intent to distribute. The trial court \u201c[drew] the inference based on [appellant\u2019s] answers [to] what the police officer asked him\u201d that \u201c[appellant] was not a [cocaine] user.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">\n<em>Motion to Suppress</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">In reviewing a trial court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress, \u201cthe burden is upon [appellant] to show that this ruling, when the evidence is considered most favorably to the Commonwealth, constituted reversible error.\u201d <em>Fore v. Commonwealth, </em>220 Va. 1007, 1010, 265 S.E.2d 729, 731 (1980). Determining whether police may make a warrantless search or seizure involves issues of both law and fact and is reviewed <em>de novo </em>on appeal. <em>See Ornelas v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 690, 696-97, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996) (articulating standard for reviewing determinations of reasonable suspicion and probable cause). However, \u201c[i]n performing such analysis, we are hound by the trial court\u2019s findings of historical fact unless \u2018plainly wrong\u2019 or without evidence to support them[,] and we give due weight to the inferences drawn from those facts by resident judges and local law enforcement officers.\u201d <em>McGee v. Commonwealth, </em>25 Va.App. 193, 198, 487 S.E.2d 259, 261 (1997) <em>(en </em>banc) (citing <em>Ornelas, </em>517 U.S. at 699, 116 S.Ct. 1657).</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">\n<em>Detention</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b73-8\">The Commonwealth concedes appellant was seized within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment when Officer Duff ordered him to lie face down on the ground and extend his arms. The Commonwealth also concedes the officers had no reason to believe appellant had been engaged in criminal activity. The question on appeal, therefore, is whether the officers\u2019 detention of appellant nevertheless was constitutionally justified. We hold that it was.</p>\n<p id=\"b74-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"30\">*30</page-number>\u201cThe [F]ourth [A]mendment does not proscribe all seizures, only those that are \u2018unreasonable.\u2019 Whether a seizure is unreasonable is determined by balancing the individual\u2019s right to be free from arbitrary government intrusions against society\u2019s countervailing interest in preventing or detecting crime and in protecting its law enforcement officers.\u201d <em>Bethea v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 474, 476, 419 S.E.2d 249, 250 (1992) <em>(en </em>banc), <em>aff\u2019d on other grounds, </em>245 Va. 416, 429 S.E.2d 211 (1993); <em>see </em>U.S. Const. amend. IV; Va. Const. art. I, \u00a7 10. The validity of a seizure \u201c \u2018turns on an objective assessment of the officer\u2019s actions in light of the facts and circumstances confronting him at the time,\u2019 and not on the officer\u2019s actual state of mind at the time the challenged action was taken.\u201d <em>Maryland v. Macon, </em>472 U.S. 463, 470-71, 105 S.Ct. 2778, 86 L.Ed.2d 370 (1985) (quoting <em>Scott v. United States, </em>436 U.S. 128, 136, 98 S.Ct. 1717, 56 L.Ed.2d 168 (1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-5\">Ordinarily, in the absence of consent, even a brief detention must be based on at least a reasonable, articulable suspicion the person seized is engaged in criminal activity. <em>See, e.g., McGee, </em>25 Va.App. at 198-99, 487 S.E.2d at 261-62. However, as the United States Supreme Court has held, the absence of probable cause or reasonable suspicion of criminal activity does not necessarily render a detention unlawful. <em>See Maryland v. Wilson, </em>519 U.S. 408, 117 S.Ct. 882, 886, 137 L.Ed.2d 41 (1997); <em>Michigan v. Summers, </em>452 U.S. 692, 705, 101 S.Ct. 2587, 69 L.Ed.2d 340 (1981); <em>see also United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, </em>428 U.S. 543, 556-62, 96 S.Ct. 3074, 49 L.Ed.2d 1116 (1976) (upholding border patrol stops of vehicles at fixed checkpoint in absence of reasonable suspicion that vehicle contained illegal aliens).</p>\n<p id=\"b74-6\">In <em>Michigan v. Summers, </em>452 U.S. 692, 101 S.Ct. 2587, 69 L.Ed.2d 340, for example, the Court held that \u201ca warrant to search for contraband founded on probable cause implicitly carries with it the limited authority to detain the occupants of the premises while a proper search is conducted.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 705, 101 S.Ct. 2587 (footnote omitted). Among various \u201clegitimate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"31\">*31</page-number>law enforcement interest[s]\u201d in detaining the occupants, it emphasized the</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b75-4\">importance ... [of] minimizing the risk of harm to the officers.... [T]he execution of a warrant to search for narcotics is the kind of transaction that may give rise to sudden violence or frantic efforts to conceal or destroy evidence. The risk of harm to both the police and the occupants is minimized if the officers routinely exercise unquestioned command of the situation.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b75-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 702-03, 101 S.Ct. 2587 (footnote omitted). Although the Court stressed the importance of the existence of the search warrant to justify the detention in that case, <em>see id. </em>at 701, 101 S.Ct. 2587, it also noted its holding did not \u201cpreclude the possibility that comparable police conduct may be justified by exigent circumstances in the absence of a warrant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 702 n. 17, 101 S.Ct. 2587.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">In the more recent case of <em>Wilson, </em>519 U.S. 408, 117 S.Ct. at 886, the Court extended <em>Pennsylvania v. Mimms, </em>434 U.S. 106, 98 S.Ct. 330, 54 L.Ed.2d 331 (1977), to hold that a police officer making a routine traffic stop may order a passenger out of the car for safety reasons, even if the officer has no reason to suspect the passenger of criminal behavior. <em>See also Bethea, </em>14 Va.App. 474, 419 S.E.2d 249. The Court noted the \u201creasonableness [of an officer\u2019s actions] \u2018depends \u201con a balance between the public interest and the individual\u2019s right to personal security free from arbitrary interference by law officers.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>Wilson, </em>519 U.S. 408, 117 S.Ct. at 885 (quoting <em>Mimms, </em>434 U.S. at 109, 98 S.Ct. 330 (quoting <em>United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, </em>422 U.S. 873, 878, 95 S.Ct. 2574, 45 L.Ed.2d 607 (1975))). \u201cOn the public interest side of the balance,\u201d the Court identified a \u201cweighty interest in officer safety,\u201d advanced by depriving the occupants of access to any weapons which might be concealed in the passenger compartment. <em>See id. </em>at 885-86, 95 S.Ct. 2574. It concluded that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Ah\">danger to an officer from a traffic stop is likely to be greater when there are passengers in addition to the driver in the stopped car. While there is not the same basis for ordering the passengers out of the car as there is for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"32\">*32</page-number>ordering the driver out, the additional intrusion on the passenger is minimal.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b76-6\"><em>Id. </em>at 886, 95 S.Ct. 2574.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-7\">Under the reasoning of <em>Summers </em>and <em>Wilson, </em>we hold the officers here were justified in ordering appellant to lie on the ground briefly, both for his safety and the safety of the officers and other bystanders. The officers lacked reasonable suspicion or probable cause to believe appellant was engaged in criminal activity and did not have an arrest warrant for the two target individuals. However, they had probable cause to believe the two target individuals were then engaged in selling cocaine in plain view directly in front of a reputed crack house, about which officers had received numerous \u201cshots fired\u201d complaints. When the four officers first began to approach the scene, the two target individuals were standing by a car in the middle of the street. By the time the officers arrived, the two men had retreated to the sidewalk into the group of about eight people, of which appellant had been a part for at least fifteen minutes. Once the target subjects had retreated into the group, that group outnumbered the police officers by a ratio of two to one. Other people, including children, were in close proximity.</p>\n<p id=\"b76-8\">Although the officers had not seen any weapons on the people at the scene, given the number of people in close proximity, the reputation of the house and block for violence, <em>see Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 282, 234 n. 1, 421 S.E.2d 911, 912 n. 1 (1992) (recognizing that \u201cpresence in a high crime area\u201d is a factor which may be considered in determining whether an investigatory stop is appropriate), and the nature of the crime for which they sought to apprehend the target subjects, <em>see, e.g., Logan v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 437, 445, 452 S.E.2d 364, 369 (1994) <em>(en </em>banc) (noting that relationship between distribution of controlled substances and possession and use of dangerous weapons \u201cis now well recognized\u201d), the evidence supports the trial court\u2019s conclusion that the officers reasonably feared for their safety and the safety of the bystanders and properly ordered those people on the sidewalk with the target subjects to he on the ground.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>We conclude the trial court did not err in denying the motion to suppress. Requiring the officers to notify the members of the group on the sidewalk that they were free to leave before or while the officers apprehended the target subjects could have posed an increased risk to the safety of the officers, the members of the group on the sidewalk, and the other bystanders if the target subjects had attempted to dispose of evidence, resist arrest, or flee the scene. Therefore, the officers\u2019 order to the bystanders on the sidewalk to lie on the ground \u201cmomentarily\u201d while the target subjects were taken into custody was not unreasonable. <em>See Baker v. Monroe Township, </em>50 F.3d 1186, 1191-92 (3d Cir.1995) (in federal civil rights action, holding that police executing no-knock search warrant for drugs could detain mother and her three children, who were climbing steps to target apartment, to protect both the officers and those detained); <em>Willowby v. City of Philadelphia, </em>946 F.Supp. 369, 373-74 (E.D.Pa.1996) (in federal civil rights action, holding that police executing search warrant for drugs did not violate constitutional rights of those present on porch of adjacent row house by ordering them to \u201cget down ... in the interest of the bystanders\u2019 and officers\u2019 safety\u201d) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b77-5\">Moreover, the officers briefly detained only those people in immediate proximity to the target subjects and not those on the nearby porch or in the van. In addition, Officer Duff testified he intended to allow people to leave the scene immediately after the target subjects had been secured and he would have frisked only those who chose to stay at the scene.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-6\">Viewing the facts in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, we cannot say the brief detention of appellant violated his rights under the United States or Virginia Constitutions.</p>\n<p id=\"b77-7\">\n<em>Frisk for Weapons</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b77-8\">Appellant also contends Officer Duff violated his Fourth Amendment rights when Duff frisked him for weapons. Again, we disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>Under settled principles, once an officer has lawfully detained an individual, \u201che is \u2018authorized to take such steps as [are] reasonably necessary to protect [his and others\u2019] personal safety and to maintain the status quo during the course of the stop.\u2019 \u201d <em>Servis v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 507, 519, 371 S.E.2d 156, 162 (1988) (quoting <em>United States v. Hensley, </em>469 U.S. 221, 235, 105 S.Ct. 675, 83 L.Ed.2d 604 (1985)). An officer may preserve the status quo by ordering the person detained to place his hands where the officer can see them. <em>See Woodson v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 787, 793-94, 421 S.E.2d 1, 5 (1992), <em>aff\u2019d, </em>245 Va. 401, 429 S.E.2d 27 (1993); <em>Bethea, </em>14 Va.App. at 478, 419 S.E.2d at 252.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-5\">Additional information may provide the basis for a frisk of the person for weapons. An officer \u201cmay conduct a limited pat-down search of the suspect\u2019s outer clothing to search for weapons if the officer reasonably believes, based on specific and articulable facts, that the suspect might be armed and dangerous.\u201d <em>Phillips v. Commonwealth, </em>17 Va.App. 27, 30, 434 S.E.2d 918, 920 (1993). The refusal of a person detained to show his hands may provide just such a basis. <em>See James v. Commonwealth, </em>22 Va.App. 740, 745-46, 473 S.E.2d 90, 92 (1996) (permitting frisk of passenger who appeared jittery and did not respond to officer\u2019s order to keep hands in view). Additional factors appropriate for consideration may include the reputation of the neighborhood as a high-crime area. <em>See Brown, </em>15 Va.App. at 234 n. 1, 421 S.E.2d at 912 n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b78-6\">Officer Duff initially detained appellant for safety reasons and did not have reasonable suspicion of criminal activity by appellant. However, Officer Duff was lawfully there investigating criminal activity that Investigator Thomas had observed. Once appellant had been detained, Duff was entitled to take reasonable steps to protect the safety of the officers, the target individuals, and everyone else at or near the scene. In determining what measures were appropriate, Duff was entitled to consider the reputation of the immediate area for violence and drug-related crime. <em>See id. </em>Duff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"35\">*35</page-number>attempted to maintain safety in a minimally intrusive manner by ordering appellant and the others on the sidewalk to lie prone and extend their arms from their bodies so their hands would be in plain view. When appellant refused Officer Duffs order to extend his hands from his body, placing them under his torso instead, Duff had specific and articulable facts giving rise to the reasonable belief appellant \u201cmight be armed and dangerous.\u201d <em>See id.; see also United States v. Moorefield, </em>111 F.3d 10, 13-14 (3d Cir.1997) (upholding pat-down of passenger following his failure to obey officer\u2019s order to place hands in view); <em>Lansdown v. Commonwealth, </em>226 Va. 204, 212-13, 308 S.E.2d 106, 111-12 (1983), <em>cert. denied, </em>465 U.S. 1104, 104 S.Ct. 1604, 80 L.Ed.2d 134 (1984) (permitting frisk of van\u2019s passenger for weapons where driver was stopped for multiple traffic infractions including reckless driving and attempting to elude a police officer and where passenger \u201cindividually did nothing to indicate he possessed a concealed weapon\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b79-5\">Appellant\u2019s subsequent compliance with Duffs order and Duffs failure to find a weapon on the ground beneath appellant did not remove the possibility appellant had a weapon on his person and might again try to access it.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-6\">Under these facts, we conclude the frisk for weapons was not an unreasonable search.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-7\">\n<em>\u201cPlain Feel\u201d Doctrine</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b79-8\">When Officer Duff felt the rocks of crack cocaine in appellant\u2019s pocket, the plain feel doctrine of <em>Minnesota v. Dickerson, </em>508 U.S. 366, 113 S.Ct. 2130, 124 L.Ed.2d 334 (1993), permitted their seizure. Under that doctrine,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b79-9\">[i]f a police officer lawfully pats down a suspect\u2019s outer clothing and feels an object whose contour or mass makes its identity immediately apparent, there has been no invasion of the suspect\u2019s privacy beyond that already authorized by the officer\u2019s search for weapons; if the object is contraband, its warrantless seizure would be justified by the same <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>practical considerations that inhere in the plain view context.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b80-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 375-76, 113 S.Ct. 2130.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">Here, Officer Duff testified he identified the item when he first felt it and did not have to manipulate it in order to complete the identification. Therefore, viewed in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, the evidence supported the trial court\u2019s denial of appellant\u2019s motion to suppress on this issue. <em>See also Ruffin v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 206, 208-09, 409 S.E.2d 177, 178-79 (1991) (applying plain view doctrine to uphold seizure where officer conducting pat-down for weapons found item he thought to be controlled substance).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">\n<em>Intent to Distribute</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">Appellant also challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to prove intent to distribute. In evaluating such a challenge, we view the record in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. <em>See Martin v. Commonwealth, </em>4 Va.App. 438, 443, 358 S.E.2d 415, 418 (1987). The credibility of a witness, the weight accorded the testimony, and the inferences to be drawn from proven facts are matters to be determined by the fact finder. <em>See Long v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 194, 199, 379 S.E.2d 473, 476 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">Circumstantial evidence may establish the elements of a crime, provided it excludes every reasonable hypothesis of innocence. <em>See, e.g., Tucker v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 141, 143, 442 S.E.2d 419, 420 (1994). However, \u201cthe Commonwealth need only exclude reasonable hypotheses of innocence that flow from the evidence, not those that spring from the imagination of the defendant.\u201d <em>Hamilton v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 751, 755, 433 S.E.2d 27, 29 (1993). Whether a hypothesis of innocence is reasonable is a question of fact, <em>see Cantrell v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va.App. 269, 290, 373 S.E.2d 328, 339 (1988), and a finding by the trial court is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"37\">*37</page-number>binding on appeal unless plainly wrong. <em>See Martin, </em>4 Va.App. at 443, 358 S.E.2d at 418.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">\u201cBecause direct proof of intent [to distribute drugs] is often impossible, it must be shown by circumstantial evidence.\u201d Ser<em>vis v. Commonwealth, </em>6 Va.App. 507, 524, 371 S.E.2d 156, 165 (1988). Such evidence may include the quantity of drugs and cash possessed and whether appellant used drugs. <em>See Poindexter v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 730, 734-35, 432 S.E.2d 527, 530 (1993). Possession of a large sum of money, especially in small denominations, and the absence of any paraphernalia suggestive of personal use, also are regularly recognized as factors indicating an intent to distribute. <em>See Colbert v. Commonwealth, </em>219 Va. 1, 4, 244 S.E.2d 748, 748-49 (1978).</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">Here, appellant possessed 1.44 grams of crack cocaine rocks and $150 in cash, comprised of five $20 bills and one $50 bill. Officer Duff, who was accepted by the court as an expert, testified the quantity of cocaine found was inconsistent with personal use and consistent with distribution. He testified appellant\u2019s possession of the $20 bills also was consistent with distribution of crack cocaine, which usually was sold in $20 and $40 increments. Finally, police found no evidence of personal use of cocaine, and appellant denied holding it for someone else. These facts, combined with appellant\u2019s indignant response to police when they asked if he smoked crack cocaine, permitted the inference that he possessed the cocaine with the requisite intent to distribute. The trial court, as the trier of fact, drew just such an inference, and we cannot say it erred in doing so. Officer Duff admitted an addict could consume one gram of cocaine in a day, and Investigator Thomas admitted appellant could have purchased the drugs as they were packaged. However, no evidence in the record showed appellant personally used cocaine, and appellant\u2019s statement to Officer Duff negated such an inference. Therefore, the trial court was entitled to conclude that the only reasonable hypothesis flowing from the evidence was that appellant intended to distribute the cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"38\">*38</page-number>For these reasons, we hold the trial court did not err in denying appellant\u2019s motion to suppress and in finding the evidence sufficient to prove he intended to distribute the cocaine.

After appellant assumed a prone position, but kept his hands under his torso, Duff conducted a pat-down search and discovered the cocaine used to support appellant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">\u201c[PJeople are not shorn of all Fourth Amendment protection when they step from their homes onto the public sidewalks.\u201d <em>Delaware v.

A central concern in balancing these competing considerations in a variety of settings has been to assure that an individual\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy is not subject to arbitrary invasions solely at the unfettered discretion of officers in the field. To this end, the Fourth Amendment requires that a seizure must be based on specific, objective facts indicating that society\u2019s legitimate interests require the seizure of the particular individual, or that the seizure must be carried out pursuant to a plan embodying explicit, neutral limitations on the conduct of individual officers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b83-7\"><em>Brown v.

First, in <em>Michigan v. Summers, </em>452 U.S. 692, 705, 101 S.Ct. 2587, 69 L.Ed.2d 340 (1981), the Court held that police could, without objective suspicion, detain the occupant of a house <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"41\">*41</page-number>during a search conducted pursuant to a valid warrant. <em>See also Allen v. Commonwealth, </em>3 Va.App. 657, 661-62, 353 S.E.2d 162, 165 (1987) (applying <em>Summers </em>to substantially identical facts). The Court explained that the state\u2019s interest in officer safety outweighed the \u201cincremental intrusion on personal liberty [caused by the defendant\u2019s detention] when the search of a home has been authorized by a valid warrant.\u201d <em>Summers, </em>452 U.S. at 703, 101 S.Ct. 2587.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-5\">Second, courts have held that police may, without objective suspicion, order occupants of a lawfully stopped car to perform certain actions. In <em>Pennsylvania v. Mimms, </em>434 U.S. 106, 110-11, 98 S.Ct. 330, 54 L.Ed.2d 331 (1977) <em>(per curiam), </em>the Court held that police may order the driver of a lawfully stopped car out of the vehicle. The Court reasoned that the important value of officer safety outweighed the \u201cmere inconvenience\u201d to the driver, an \u201cadditional intrusion [which] can only be described as <em>de minimis.\u201d Id. </em>at 111, 98 S.Ct. 330. The Court explained as follows: \u201cThe police have already lawfully decided that the driver shall be briefly detained; the only question is whether he shall spend that period sitting in the driver\u2019s seat of his car or standing alongside it.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In a series of decisions, this Court has applied <em>Mimms </em>to similar orders by police, including orders for passengers to step out of stopped vehicles. <em>See Stanley v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 873, 875, 433 S.E.2d 512, 513 (1993) (citing, <em>inter alia, Mimms, </em>434 U.S. at 111, 98 S.Ct. 330); <em>Thompson v.

Wilson, </em>519 U.S. 408, 117 S.Ct. 882, 884, 137 L.Ed.2d 41 (1997), the United States Supreme Court extended the <em>Mimms </em>rule to passengers. The Court reasoned that, \u201cas a practical matter, the passengers are already stopped by virtue of the stop of the vehicle.\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>519 U.S. 408, 117 S.Ct. at 886. The Court held that the state\u2019s weighty interest in preventing violence to police outweighed the minimal \u201cadditional intrusion\u201d on a passenger\u2019s rights. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"42\">*42</page-number>In the <em>Summers </em>and <em>Wilson </em>lines of cases, the detention of the defendant represented an incremental, additional intrusion following an antecedent search or seizure based on probable cause or reasonable suspicion, such as the execution of a valid search warrant or lawful stop. The first facet of the detentions approved in the <em>Summers </em>and <em>Wilson </em>lines of cases is that the challenged seizure rests on an antecedent determination of probable cause or reasonable suspicion. <em>See Wilson, </em>519 U.S. 408, 117 S.Ct. at 884 (holding that the <em>Mimms </em>rule \u201cthat a police officer may as a matter of course order the driver of a lawfully stopped car to exit his vehicle[ ] extends to passengers as well\u201d); <em>Summers, </em>452 U.S. at 703, 101 S.Ct. 2587 (\u201cThe existence of a search warrant ... provides an objective justification for the detention.\u201d); <em>Mimms, </em>434 U.S. at 109, 98 S.Ct. 330 (\u201c[W]e ... deal only with the narrow question of whether the order to get out of the car, issued after the driver was lawfully detained, was reasonable and thus permissible under the Fourth Amendment.\u201d); <em>Harris v.

See Wilson, </em>519 U.S. 408, 117 S.Ct. at 886 (reasoning that \u201cthe additional intrusion on the passenger is minimal\u201d); <em>Summers, </em>452 U.S. at 703, 101 S.Ct. 2587 (\u201c[T]he detention represents only an incremental intrusion on personal liberty when the search of a home has been authorized by a valid warrant.\u201d); <em>Mimms, </em>434 U.S. at 109, 98 S.Ct. 330 (\u2018We think this additional intrusion can only be described as <em>de minimis.\"); Harris, </em>27 Va.App. at 562, 500 S.E.2d at 261 (\u201cThis authority over passengers at a lawful traffic stop is deemed a \u2018reasonable\u2019 seizure under the Fourth Amendment because the \u2018weighty [public] interest in officer safety\u2019 during traffic stops, which \u2018may be dangerous encounters,\u2019 sufficiently <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>outweighs the minimal additional intrusion upon the private interests of passengers, who \u2018are already stopped by virtue of the [lawful] stop of the vehicle.\u2019 \u201d (quoting <em>Wilson, </em>519 U.S. 408, 117 S.Ct. at 885-86) (alterations in <em>Harris)); Hatcher, </em>14 Va.App. at 491, 419 S.E.2d at 259 (\u201cHere, appellant was not ordered to exit the vehicle but to remain beside it while Officer Reetz conducted his brief follow-up investigation following his detention of the car and its occupants.

In the two cases which did not discuss the minimal, incremental nature of the seizure, the seizure was not challenged by the defendant, and we merely explained the permissibility of the order to exit the vehicle before reversing on other grounds. <em>See Stanley, </em>16 Va.App. at 875, 433 S.E.2d at 513\u201414; <em>Thompson, </em>16 Va.App. at 481, 431 S.E.2d at 74.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">In stark contrast, this case has none of the distinguishing features of <em>Wilson, Summers, Mimms, </em>or the Virginia cases applying them. Prior to ordering appellant to the ground, Duff had made no valid, antecedent determination of reasonable suspicion or probable cause with respect to appellant. Instead, as the Commonwealth concedes, the police had no individualized suspicion of appellant whatsoever. In addition, Duffs seizure of appellant was not an additional increment of intrusion incident to an otherwise justified search or seizure of appellant, <em>see Mimms, </em>434 U.S. at 111, 98 S.Ct. 330, appellant\u2019s home, <em>see Summers, </em>452 U.S. at 701, 101 S.Ct. 2587, or a vehicle, which incidentally and necessarily intruded on appellant\u2019s mobility. <em>See Wilson, </em>519 U.S. 408, 117 S.Ct. at 886. Duff\u2019s order to appellant to lie on the ground was the seizure, and it was not conducted as a component part of any legal search or seizure. Finally, Duffs seizure of appellant cannot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>reasonably be described as \u201ca mere inconvenience,\u201d <em>Mimms, </em>434 U.S. at 111, 98 S.Ct. 330, \u201cminimal,\u201d <em>Wilson, </em>519 U.S. 408, 117 S.Ct. at 886, or <em>\u201cde </em>minimis.\u201d <em>Hatcher, </em>14 Va.App. at 491, 419 S.E.2d at 259. Rather than being ordered to step out of his car or to remain in his house, appellant was ordered to lie face down on the sidewalk with his arms extended from his body. As opposed to the circumstances addressed in <em>Wilson, Summers, </em>and <em>Mimms, </em>Duff did not order appellant to perform a commonplace action like stepping out of his car but instead ordered appellant to submit to complete police control.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">Balancing the individual\u2019s right to be free from arbitrary government intrusions against society\u2019s countervailing interest in preventing and detecting crime and in protecting its law enforcement officers, <em>see Brignoni-Ponce, </em>422 U.S. at 878, 95 S.Ct. 2574, I would hold that Duffs seizure of appellant required reasonable, articulable suspicion of appellant\u2019s involvement in criminal activity. \u201cIn the absence of any basis for suspecting appellant of misconduct, the balance between the public interest and appellant\u2019s right to personal security and privacy tilts in favor of freedom from police interference.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>443 U.S. at 52, 99 S.Ct. 2637; <em>see also Moss v. Commonwealth, </em>7 Va.App. 305, 308, 373 S.E.2d 170, 172 (1988) (citing <em>Brown, </em>443 U.S. at 52, 99 S.Ct. 2637). The majority\u2019s resolution of the balance in favor of police power violates the \u201ccentral concern in balancing these competing considerations\u201d: \u201cto assure that an individual\u2019s reasonable expectation of privacy is not subject to arbitrary invasions solely at the unfettered discretion of officers in the field.\u201d <em>Brown, </em>443 U.S. at 50-51, 99 S.Ct. 2637 (citing <em>Prouse, </em>440 U.S. at 654-55, 99 S.Ct. 1391; <em>Brignoni-Ponce, </em>422 U.S. at 882, 95 S.Ct. 2574). Given the Commonwealth\u2019s concession that Duff did not have reasonable, articulable suspicion to seize appellant, I would hold the seizure unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">The majority lists several facts in support of the officers\u2019 fears for their safety, including the number of people at the scene, the reputation of the area for violence, and the nature of the crime. These factors, however, are relevant only to a determination of whether a seizure is supported by reason<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>able, articulable suspicion.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> They are of no consequence here because the majority does not premise its holding on the ground that the officers had reasonable' suspicion to order appellant to lie down. Instead, it holds \u201c[ujnder the reasoning of <em>Summers </em>and <em>Wilson </em>\u201d that the officers could seize appellant notwithstanding the fact that \u201c[t]he officers lacked reasonable suspicion or probable cause to believe appellant was engaged in criminal activity and did not have an arrest warrant for the two target individuals.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">In his dissent in <em>Wilson, </em>Justice Stevens wrote, \u201cHow far this ground-breaking decision will take us, I do not venture to predict. I fear, however, that it may pose a more serious threat to liberty than the Court realizes.\u201d 519 U.S. 408, 117 S.Ct. at 890. Today, the majority takes the step foreseen by Justice Stevens and expands the reasoning of <em>Wilson </em>far beyond its limited context. The majority\u2019s holding that police may seize individuals without reasonable suspicion or probable cause represents a radical departure from well-established Fourth Amendment principles found in the prior decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States as well as the courts of Virginia. Accordingly, I dissent.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b87-6\">. In three cases, Virginia courts have approved police orders for the occupant of a vehicle to perform certain actions on the basis of reasonable, articulable suspicion. <em>See Bethea </em>v. <em>Commonwealth, </em>245 Va. 416, 419-20, 429 S.E.2d 211, 213 (1993) (criticizing this Court\u2019s Mimms-based reasoning, but approving order to passenger to get out of the vehicle because it was based on reasonable, articulable suspicion); <em>Pryor v. Commonwealth, </em>17 Va.App. 117, 118-19, 435 S.E.2d 417, 418-19 (1993) <em>(en </em>banc) (reciting facts justifying order for passenger to get out of car, and specifically disavowing reliance on our <em>Bethea </em>and <em>Hatcher </em>line of cases); <em>Woodson v. Commonwealth, </em>14 Va.App. 787, 792-94, 421 S.E.2d 1, 4-5 (1992) (explaining <em>Bethea </em>analysis, but ultimately \"find[ing] that the evidence was sufficient to support a reasonable suspicion that [the defendant] was involved in criminal activity\u201d), <em>aff\u2019d on other grounds, </em>245 Va. 401, 429 S.E.2d 27 (1993) (holding that defendant was not seized within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment by the police order to place his hands on the steering wheel because he did not comply).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b90-6\">. The majority cites <em>Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>15 Va.App. 232, 421 S.E.2d 911 (1992), and <em>Logan v. Commonwealth, </em>19 Va.App. 437, 452 S.E.2d 364 (1994) <em>(en banc), </em>in support of the factors it lists. In <em>Brown, </em>we held that an officer's characterization of the park where the defendant was arrested as an \u201copen drug market\u201d was admissible as evidence of possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, 15 Va.App. at 235, 421 S.E.2d at 913, but parenthetically noted in the footnote cited by the majority that \"the defendant's presence in a high crime area, standing alone, does not provide the requisite degree of suspicion to justify an investigatory stop.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 234 n. 1, 421 S.E.2d at 912 n. 1. In <em>Logan, </em>we held that a broken rear vent car window constituted reasonable, articulable suspicion of criminal activity. <em>Logan, </em>19 Va.App. at 441-42, 452 S.E.2d at 367-68.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
