Upon reviewing the record and the briefs of the parties, we conclude that this appeal is without merit. Accordingly, we summarily affirm the commission\u2019s decision. <em>See </em>Rule 5A:27.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-7\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-8\">On appeal, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party below. <em>See R.G. Moore Bldg. Corp. v. Mullins, </em>10 Va.App. 211, 212, 390 S.E.2d 788, 788 (1990). So viewed, the evidence proved that Staton worked for the employer as a caser and label machine operator. In that job, she pulled racks out of the label machine, lowered the racks, loaded the racks with labels, and restarted the machine. She also opened cardboard boxes, folded the flaps of the boxes, placed labels on the boxes, and then put the boxes on a caser. She processed 4,000 to 5,000 such boxes during her daily eight-hour shift, using her left hand more than her right hand. Staton estimated that she processed approximately 550 such boxes per hour, or eight to ten per minute. She performed these tasks for the last twelve of her eighteen years while working for the employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-9\">On September 4, 1997, after Staton had been working for approximately two hours and as she was folding flaps on a box, she experienced a \u201cbad pain\u201d in her left hand. She could not straighten her left hand and she felt pain throughout her hand. After Staton reported this incident to her supervisor, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"653\">*653</page-number>she left work and reported to a physician to whom her employer referred her.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-4\">The following day, Staton began treatment with Dr. Bernard M. Swope, an orthopedic surgeon. Dr. Swope diagnosed Staton as suffering from \u201c[p]robable carpal tunnel syndrome, bilaterally, left greater than right.\u201d Dr. Swope later opined that \u201c[b]ased on the number of years that [Staton] has worked at that job and the repetitive nature of the job, and her recent difficulties on the job, I think that there is a high probability that the carpal tunnel is a result of her work environment.\u201d Dr. Swope performed surgery on Staton\u2019s left hand and arm.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-5\">Staton testified that she did not perform any activities outside of her employment that involved the repetitive use of her hands. In addition, prior to September 4, 1997, Staton had never experienced numbness or pain in either hand while performing activities outside of her work.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-6\">In ruling that Staton\u2019s bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome was a compensable ordinary disease of life pursuant to Code \u00a7 65.2-401, the commission found as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b697-7\">In the absence of any contrary medical evidence, we are left solely with Dr. Swope\u2019s opinion. Section 65.2-401 requires the elements be established by \u201cclear and convincing evidence, <em>(not a mere probability)\u201d </em>(emphasis added). Dr. Swope\u2019s opinion is more than a mere probability. It is a high probability, which we find here is clear and convincing evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b697-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-9\">\u201c Whether a disease is causally related to the employment and not causally related to other factors is ... a finding of fact.\u2019 When there is credible evidence to support it, such a finding of fact is \u2018conclusive and binding\u2019 on this Court.\u201d <em>Ross Laboratories v. Barbour, </em>13 Va.App. 373, 377-78, 412 S.E.2d 205, 208 (1991) (quoting <em>Island Creek Coal Co. v. Breeding, </em>6 Va.App. 1, 12, 365 S.E.2d 782, 788 (1988)).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"654\">*654</page-number>In 1997, the General Assembly amended Code \u00a7 65.2-400 to provide that \u201ccondition[s] of carpal tunnel syndrome are not occupational diseases but are ordinary diseases of life as defined in [Code] \u00a7 65.2-401.\u201d The General Assembly also amended Code \u00a7 65.2-401 to provide that the elements required to prove a compensable ordinary disease of life must be \u201cestablished by clear and convincing evidence, (not a mere probability).\u201d We note that the amendment deleted from the statute the words \u201cto a reasonable medical certainty.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b698-4\">The current statutory standard is well defined in Virginia.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b698-5\">Clear and convincing evidence has been defined as \u201cthat measure or degree of proof which will produce in the mind of the trier of facts a firm belief or conviction as to the allegations sought to be established. It is intermediate, being more than a mere preponderance, but not to the extent of such certainty as is required beyond a reasonable doubt as in criminal cases. It does not mean clear and unequivocal.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b698-6\"><em>Fred C. Walker Agcy. &amp; Aetna Cas. Co. v. Lucas, </em>215 Va. 535, 540-41, 211 S.E.2d 88, 92 (1975) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b698-7\">Dr. Swope\u2019s uncontradicted opinion and Staton\u2019s testimony constitute credible evidence to support the commission\u2019s findings. Dr. Swope expressed his opinion in terms of a \u201chigh probability\u201d not a \u201cmere probability.\u201d Based upon his opinion and Staton\u2019s testimony, the commission, as the trier of facts, could conclude that the evidence proved clearly and convincingly that Staton\u2019s bilateral .carpal tunnel syndrome was a compensable ordinary disease of life.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-8\">For these reasons, we affirm the commission\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b698-9\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
