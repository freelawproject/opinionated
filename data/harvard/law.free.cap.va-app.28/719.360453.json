We disagree and affirm the judgment of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b765-8\">On appeal, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the Commonwealth, granting to it all reasonable inferences fairly deducible therefrom. <em>See Higginbotham v. Commonwealth, </em>216 Va. 349, 352, 218 S.E.2d 534, 537 (1975). The judgment of the trial court sitting without a jury will not be set aside unless plainly wrong or without evidence to support it. <em>Martin v. Commonwealth, 4 </em>Va.App. 438, 443, 358 S.E.2d 415, 418 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b765-9\">During the evening of June 30, 1997, Franklin went to the home of Lashane Turner, his former girlfriend and the mother of his two children. Franklin pounded on the door and threatened to kill Turner when she refused to admit him. She moved a couch in front of the door. However, Franklin managed to break the lock and splinter the door, and inserted his arm and shoulder through the opening into Turner\u2019s apartment. Turner\u2019s neighbor, Lisa Parker, called the police. When a security guard arrived, Franklin fled.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b765-10\">If any person [in the nighttime enters without breaking or in the daytime breaks and enters] with intent to commit assault and battery, he shall be guilty of statutory burglary\u2014</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b765-11\">Code \u00a7 18.2-91. Franklin contends that because the statute provides no definition of \u201centry,\u201d it should be read to require <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"722\">*722</page-number>entry of the entire person. He argues that because only his arm and shoulder entered Turner\u2019s apartment, the evidence fails to support his conviction. We do not interpret the statute thus.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-5\">This case raises an issue of first impression. No previous Virginia case addresses directly what constitutes a burglarious entry. However,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b766-6\">[t]he common law of England, insofar as it is not repugnant to the principles of the Bill of Rights and Constitution of this Commonwealth, shall continue in full force within the same, and be the rule of decision, except as altered by the General Assembly.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b766-7\">Code \u00a7 1-10. Under common law, an entry occurs when any part of the body enters a dwelling. <em>See </em>Roger D. Groot, <em>Criminal Offenses and Defenses in Virginia </em>62 (3d ed. 1994). The legislature has not altered this definition of an entry. Therefore, Franklin\u2019s intrusion of his arm and shoulder into Turner\u2019s apartment constituted an entry under Code \u00a7 18.2-91. The judgment of the trial court is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b766-8\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
