Jones contends the convictions should be reversed because the trial judge denied her the opportunity to present evidence in support of her insanity defense when she refused to enter a plea of \u201cnot guilty by reason of insanity.\u201d For the reasons that follow, we reverse the convictions and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-10\">Rose Marie Outland Jones was indicted for murder and use of a firearm in the commission of murder. Prior to trial, she timely notified the attorney for the Commonwealth that she would put in issue her sanity at the time of the charged offenses and would present psychiatric evidence in support of that defense. When Jones was arraigned, she pled not guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-11\">The Commonwealth\u2019s evidence at trial included Jones\u2019 taped confession to police. In her confession, Jones said she and her husband had been married two months and were having marital problems. Jones said she purchased a gun a month before she married her husband because she was afraid of him. She had previously obtained warrants for his arrest for stalking and assault but dropped both charges because she was afraid of him.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-12\">After trying to make the marital relationship work, she decided it would not work. Her husband was \u201cpressuring\u201d her to live a life-style she did not like. On the day of the shooting, they argued because Jones wanted to separate from him. She told him that she was having \u201cproblems\u201d and needed to get away. Jones\u2019 husband did not want her to leave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"446\">*446</page-number>him and did not \u201cwant to go nowhere.\u201d She said her husband, who had been violent toward her in the past, began to get \u201cupset.\u201d In response to his reaction, Jones went to the bedroom, retrieved her gun, loaded it, and hid it in a laundry hamper beside her bed. When her husband entered the bedroom and suggested they go for a ride, Jones declined and told him she believed he intended to kill them both. Because Jones thought her husband was going to get his gun, she grabbed her gun and tried unsuccessfully to fire it at him. She then pulled back the slide and shot him. Jones said she followed her husband out the door and was going to shoot him again because she wanted to kill him. When he fell to the ground, Jones dialed 911 and reported the incident to the police. She then called the emergency number she had been given to use when she needed to contact a counselor at the Community Help Center.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">Jones\u2019 neighbor testified that she went to her door after she heard a gunshot. She saw Jones\u2019 husband stagger from his front door and heard him say, \u201cGirl, you shot me,\u201d or \u201cWhy did you shoot me?\u201d The neighbor saw Jones with a gun in her hand and watched Jones\u2019 son wrestle the gun from her. When the police arrived and handcuffed Jones\u2019 son, Jones told the police, \u201cHe didn\u2019t have anything to do with it \u2014 I did.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">At the close of the Commonwealth\u2019s case, the Commonwealth objected to Jones defending both on the grounds of self-defense and insanity. The trial judge required Jones\u2019 defense counsel to elect whether to proceed on a plea of not guilty based on self-defense or not guilty by reason of insanity. The trial judge also ruled that he was \u201cnot going to allow the expert to say [Jones was] insane if [Jones was] not pleading \u2018not guilty by reason of insanity.\u2019 \u201d Jones\u2019 counsel then notified the judge that Jones would not proceed with an insanity defense because of the judge\u2019s ruling. Jones proffered to the trial judge an oral summary of the testimony of Dr. Alice Twining, a clinical psychologist, and Dr. Twining\u2019s written report of her forensic evaluation of Jones.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"447\">*447</page-number>In Jones\u2019 defense, several witnesses related the difficulties between Jones and her husband. The witnesses testified that Jones\u2019 husband abused and harassed Jones and had threatened to kill her. A witness testified that in early 1996 she heard Jones\u2019 husband say that \u201cbefore he let [Jones] go he would kill her first.\u201d Jones\u2019 son testified that Jones\u2019 husband threatened to kill Jones and often carried a gun. A police officer testified that three months prior to Jones\u2019 husband\u2019s death, Jones obtained a warrant for her husband\u2019s arrest for stalking her.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">The jury convicted Jones of murder and use of a firearm in the commission of murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-7\">Code \u00a7 19.2-254 provides that \u201c[a]n accused may plead not guilty, guilty or nolo contendere.\u201d Neither that statute nor any other statute authorizes or requires an accused to enter a plea of \u201cnot guilty by reason of insanity.\u201d Indeed, Code \u00a7 19.2-168, which contains the statutory requirement for preserving the defense of insanity, does not require an accused to plead \u201cnot guilty by reason of insanity.\u201d In pertinent part, Code \u00a7 19.2-168 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b491-8\">In any case in which a person charged with a crime intends (1) to put in issue his sanity at the time of the crime charged and (ii) to present testimony of an expert to support his claim on this issue at his trial, he, or his counsel, shall give notice in writing to the attorney for the Commonwealth, at least twenty-one days prior to his trial, of his intention to present such evidence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b491-10\">\n<em>Id.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b491-11\">The Attorney General candidly concedes that \u201c[t]he Commonwealth knows of no legal requirement that a defendant enter a formal plea of \u2018not guilty by reason of insanity\u2019 in order to be permitted to present evidence of insanity.\u201d Furthermore, the parties agree that Jones complied with the statutory notice requirements. In view of the evidence in the record that Jones complied with the requirements of Code <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"448\">*448</page-number>\u00a7\u00a7 19.2-254 and 19.2-168, we hold that the trial judge erred when he ruled that the trial could not proceed in an orderly fashion on Jones\u2019 insanity defense unless Jones entered a formal plea of \u201cnot guilty by reason of insanity.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b492-5\">Arguing that \u201cJones\u2019 evidence of insanity was weak at best\u201d and insignificant in comparison to Jones\u2019 confession, the Commonwealth contends the exclusion of Dr. Twining\u2019s testimony was harmless. We disagree. The record contains a proffer of Dr. Twining\u2019s expected expert witness testimony and her written report. This proffer indicates that Dr. Twining, who examined Jones pursuant to a circuit judge\u2019s order, was prepared to testify concerning Jones\u2019 mental state at the time of the offense. Dr. Twining would have testified that Jones\u2019 illness made her unable to understand the nature and consequences of her acts and unable to understand right from wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">Dr. Twining\u2019s report detailed Jones\u2019 history of psychiatric treatment, including treatment at Eastern State and Maryview Psychiatric Hospitals. The report also disclosed that Jones had suffered at least two \u201ccatatonic episodes.\u201d Dr. Twining reported that Jones \u201csuffers from an Atypical Depression with Psychotic Features, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, a Dissociative Disorder and a Personality Disorder which renders her mentally incompetent in times of extreme stress.\u201d The portion of the report styled \u201cMental State at Time of Offense\u201d and the proffer of Dr. Twining\u2019s expected testimony clearly establish that Dr. Twining could have provided an evidentiary basis upon which the jury might have found that Jones was insane at the time of the offense.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number><em>Shifflett v. Commonwealth, </em>221 Va. 760, 769, 274 S.E.2d 305, 310 (1981) (noting that \u201c[i]n Virginia ... insanity is an affirmative defense that the defendant must establish to the satisfaction of the fact finder\u201d). Our Supreme Court has \u201cgenerally recognized that it is advisable to adduce expert testimony to better resolve such a complex problem [as insanity].\u201d <em>Id. </em>Furthermore, the opinion of an expert witness often \u201ccarries great weight with the jury and could very well have been the decisive factor in their minds in determining the defendant\u2019s guilt.\u201d <em>Callahan v. Commonwealth, </em>8 Va.App. 135, 140, 379 S.E.2d 476, 479 (1989). We cannot say from this record that \u201cthe error did not affect the verdict.\u201d <em>Lavinder v. Commonwealth, </em>12 Va.App. 1003, 1005, 407 S.E.2d 910, 911 (1991) <em>(en banc).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b493-5\">Accordingly, we reverse the convictions and remand for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b493-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b492-7\">. In deciding whether a person can be criminally insane yet intend to commit a criminal act, the Supreme Court stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b492-8\">On the surface, there appears to be a blatant inconsistency in concluding, as we do, that a person may be criminally insane when shooting another, and thus avoid full criminal sanctions, and yet that same individual can be denied insurance coverage because he \"intended\u201d to shoot his victim. A more careful analysis, however, will reveal there is no inconsistency at all.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b493-7\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"449\">*449</page-number>In the law, there are many situations in which a person may intentionally injure or kill another and not be subject to criminal punishment. For example, an individual may kill in self-defense. The executioner may kill with the sanction of the State. A soldier may injure or kill under rules of combat. This conduct is intentional, but it is also excusable. Likewise, an individual may be excused from penally if he is insane at the time he commits a criminal act. As here, he may do the act with every intention of consummating it, but when it is shown that he was mentally ill, he is excused from the imposition of the usual sanctions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b493-8\"><em>Johnson v.
