On appeal, she contends (1) the trial court erred by admitting a police officer\u2019s inadmissible hearsay testimony, and (2) erred by ruling that it had no authority to suspend or modify the jury\u2019s sentence unless it \u201cshocked the conscience of the court or was wholly beyond the evidence presented.\u201d We find that the police officer\u2019s challenged testimony was not inadmissible hearsay. Therefore, we affirm the conviction. On the sentencing issue, the Attorney General concedes, and we agree, that the trial judge applied an incorrect standard in denying the motion to suspend or modify the sentence. The trial judge stated that he could suspend only a sentence that \u201cshocked the conscience of the court.\u201d Because the trial judge had much broader discretion to suspend the sentence, we vacate imposition of the sentence and remand the case for reconsideration of the motion to suspend or modify the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-11\">\n<em>I. BACKGROUND</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b601-12\">During execution of a search warrant at Swain\u2019s home, a police officer stationed at the front door witnessed Swain arrive by car. The officer testified that as Swain exited the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>vehicle and walked toward her house, Juanita Watson came from \u201caround\u201d a parked van and joined Swain.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-5\">The officer testified that as Watson approached Swain, Swain said, \u201csomething similar to, what do you need or what do you want.\u201d Watson replied: \u201cA twenty.\u201d The officer testified that \u201ca twenty\u201d is street terminology for a small piece of crack cocaine. According to the officer, Swain \u201cadvised Ms. Watson to wait a minute or wait just a minute, [or] something similar.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b602-6\">Swain made a pretrial motion to suppress Watson\u2019s statement, \u201ca twenty,\u201d as inadmissible hearsay. Swain contends the Commonwealth offered Watson\u2019s statement for its implied assertion that Swain was a drug dealer. The trial court denied the motion to suppress Watson\u2019s statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b602-7\">At the sentencing hearing, counsel for Swain asked the trial court to suspend part of the jury\u2019s recommended sentence. In denying the motion to suspend the sentence, the trial court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b602-8\">Now, with regard to whether the jury\u2019s recommended sentence is followed or not, the standard of measurement there is ... if it\u2019s a sentence ... that shocks the conscience of the Court, that is wholly beyond the evidence of the case, a miscarriage of justice then the Court has the power and authority to step in and should step in. On the other hand, if it\u2019s within the range of punishment, in this instance at the lower end and is justified by the evidence ... then the Court has no authority to set that jury verdict aside just because the Court might have done differently or may have given \u00e1 lesser sentence had the Court heard the case instead of the jury.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b602-9\">\n<em>II. ANALYSIS</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"AkB\">\n<em>A. Hearsay</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b602-10\">In reviewing a trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suppress, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prevailing party. <em>See Alvarez v. Commonwealth, </em>24 Va.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>App. 768, 775, 485 S.E.2d 646, 649 (1997). \u201c \u2018The admissibility of evidence is within the broad discretion of the trial court, and a ruling will not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of an abuse of discretion.\u2019\u201d <em>Brown v. Commonwealth, </em>21 Va.App. 552, 555, 466 S.E.2d 116, 117 (1996) (quoting <em>Crews v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 115, 118, 442 S.E.2d 407, 409 (1994)). \u201cHearsay evidence is testimony in court ... of a statement made out of court [that is] offered as an assertion to show the truth of matters asserted therein, and thus resting for its value upon the credibility of the out-of-court asserter.\u201d <em>Taylor v. Commonwealth, </em>28 Va.App. 1, 9, 502 S.E.2d 113, 117 (1998) <em>(en banc) </em>(citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-5\">Watson\u2019s statement that she wanted \u201ca twenty,\u201d is hearsay only if offered to prove the truth or falsity of the matter asserted therein. <em>See Brown v. Commonwealth, 25 </em>Va.App. 171, 179, 487 S.E.2d 248, 252 (1997) <em>(en banc). </em>Determining whether a statement is offered to prove the truth or falsity of the matter asserted requires an analysis of the purpose for which the statement is offered into evidence. <em>See generally </em>Lawrence H. Tribe, <em>Triangulating Hearsay, </em>87 Harv. L.Rev. 957, 958-59 (1974) (presenting a method for analyzing the hearsay rule).</p>\n<p id=\"b603-6\">We determine, therefore, the purpose for which the Commonwealth offered the statement. The literal truth of the assertion \u2014 that Watson wanted cocaine \u2014 -was irrelevant and was not the purpose for which the Commonwealth offered the statement. Additionally, Watson\u2019s belief that Swain was a drug dealer was not the reason the Commonwealth offered her statement into evidence. Instead, the Commonwealth offered Watson\u2019s statement, \u201ca twenty,\u201d to explain and give meaning to Swain\u2019s statements. Watson\u2019s statement gives meaning to Swain\u2019s declarations \u201cwhat do you want,\u201d and \u201cjust a minute.\u201d In context, Watson\u2019s response \u201ca twenty,\u201d explained that Swain\u2019s first inquiry was an offer to sell drugs, and the statement, \u201cjust a minute\u201d meant, \u201cI will provide you with drugs in a minute,\u201d both of which were admissible as party <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"560\">*560</page-number>admissions to prove Swain\u2019s intent. <em>See Ragland v. Commonwealth, </em>16 Va.App. 913, 918, 434 S.E.2d 675, 678-79 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-5\">We have recognized that words offered solely to give context to party admissions are not hearsay and are admissible. \u2018Words which constitute a question or accusation that result in a party admission are not barred by the hearsay evidence rule. It is only when the prompting statements have the quality of evidence (offered for the truth of the matter asserted) that they become inadmissible hearsay.\u201d <em>Atkins v. Commonwealth, </em>13 Va.App. 365, 368, 412 S.E.2d 194, 196 (1991) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-6\">A statement offered to provide context to an admission is not hearsay because it is not offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted therein. The evidentiary value of Watson\u2019s statement, \u201ca twenty,\u201d depends solely on the literal words spoken and not on what was actually on Watson\u2019s mind. In other words, Watson\u2019s statement does not \u201crest[ ] for its value upon the credibility of the out-of-court asserter.\u201d <em>Taylor, </em>28 Va.App. at 9, 502 S.E.2d at 117. <em>See e.g., State v. Miller, </em>186 Ariz. 314, 921 P.2d 1151, 1159 (Ariz.1996) (finding that declarant\u2019s statement, made during the course of an interrogation, was not hearsay because it was admitted for its effect on the defendant rather than its substantive content); <em>Williams v. State, </em>669 N.E.2d 956, 958 (Ind.1996) (admitting informant\u2019s statements in course of conversation as non-hearsay because the responses that they prompted \u201cconstituted the evidentiary weight of the conversation\u201d); <em>Worden v. State, </em>603 So.2d 581, 583 (Fla.App.1992) (stating that detectives\u2019 questions and statements were not offered for their truth, but rather to place defendant\u2019s answers in context).</p>\n<p id=\"b604-7\">Because the Commonwealth did not offer Watson\u2019s statement, \u201ca twenty,\u201d for the truth or falsity of the statement, it was not hearsay, and the trial judge did not err in admitting it.</p>\n<p id=\"b604-8\">\n<em>B. Sentencing</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b604-9\">A trial court\u2019s ruling on a motion to suspend a jury\u2019s sentence rests within the sound discretion of the trial court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"561\">*561</page-number>and should not be overturned absent an abuse of that discretion. <em>See Lane v. Commonwealth, </em>223 Va. 713, 719, 292 S.E.2d 358, 362 (1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-5\">The trial judge ruled that he lacked authority to modify a jury\u2019s recommended sentence unless the sentence \u201cshocked the [court\u2019s] conscience\u201d or was \u201cwholly beyond the evidence of the case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b605-6\">The Commonwealth concedes the trial court misstated its authority to modify a jury\u2019s recommended sentence. The jury\u2019s sentence is a \u201cfirst-step decision\u201d in determining the fair and appropriate punishment for a crime. <em>See Duncan v. Commonwealth, </em>2 Va.App. 342, 345, 343 S.E.2d 392, 394 (1986) (citing <em>Vines v. Muncy, </em>553 F.2d 342, 349 (4th Cir.1977)). The jury\u2019s sentence is subject to the judge\u2019s review after considering at the sentencing hearing various mitigating, extenuating, or even aggravating circumstances. <em>See id. </em>By granting the trial court authority to review the jury\u2019s sentence, \u201cthe legislature intended to leave the consideration of mitigating circumstances to the court. It is the court that has the responsibility of pronouncing the sentence after the maximum punishment is fixed by the jury.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cFailure to consider whether a jury sentence should be mitigated because of a belief that the jury sentence is inviolable is an abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>Bruce v. Commonwealth, </em>9 Va.App. 298, 302-03, 387 S.E.2d 279, 281 (1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b605-7\">For the foregoing reasons, we uphold the trial court\u2019s evidentiary ruling but we vacate execution of the sentence and remand the case for a judge of the court to consider Swain\u2019s motion to modify or suspend the jury\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b605-8\">\n<em>Sentence vacated and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
