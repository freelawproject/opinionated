On appeal, Baker contends the circuit court lacked jurisdiction to try him as an adult because the juvenile and domestic relations district court did not comply with the mandatory notice requirements of Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-263 and 16.1-264 concerning the initiation of proceedings against a juvenile. He argues that the juvenile court\u2019s failure to provide service of process upon his. biological father violated the mandatory requirement of Code \u00a7 16.1-263 requiring service of summonses to the \u201cparents\u201d of the juvenile. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-11\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-12\">On March 25,1996, the Commonwealth filed two petitions in the juvenile and domestic relations district court charging Baker with attempted robbery and malicious wounding. The petitions listed Baker\u2019s mother\u2019s name and address. On the line for Baker\u2019s father\u2019s name and address, the petitions read \u201cUK.\u201d A police officer served the petitions on Baker and his mother and arrested Baker. On the line on the back of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>detention order which read \u201cParents notified on_,\u201d the officer wrote the date \u201c3/25/96.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">A month later, a judge of the juvenile court held a transfer hearing pursuant to Code \u00a7 16.1-269.1. The transfer report prepared by the Department of Youth and Family Services listed Donald Michael Baker as Baker\u2019s father, noted the father\u2019s address as \u201cUnknown,\u201d and supplied no information in the spaces provided for the father\u2019s phone number, occupation, or date of birth. \u201cIn describing his relationship with his biological father\u201d in a substance abuse evaluation, Baker stated \u201c \u2018I don\u2019t have one.\u2019 \u201d However, a psychological evaluation noted Baker\u2019s recent contact with his biological father.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">The judge found probable cause to believe Baker had committed the charged offenses, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 16.1-269.1(A)(2), and granted Baker\u2019s motion for a continuance. At the continued transfer hearing, the judge found that Baker was \u201cnot a proper person to remain within the jurisdiction of the Juvenile Court\u201d and transferred Baker to the circuit court to be tried as an adult. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 16.1-269.1(A)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">Prior to the indictment, Baker filed a motion to dismiss the charges or remand the case to juvenile court and alleged that the juvenile court lacked jurisdiction to transfer the case to the circuit court because the juvenile court failed to comply with the notice requirements of Code \u00a7\u00a7 16,1-263 and 16.1-264. The circuit court judge overruled the motion, finding \u201cthat lack of notice to ... the biological father, whose address is unknown, who would have to be proceeded against by order of publication, does not deprive the Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court of jurisdiction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b353-10\">A grand jury later indicted Baker on the transferred offenses. At the trial, a jury convicted Baker of attempted robbery and the lesser offense of unlawful wounding.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-12\">Our juvenile statutes reflect \u201csociety\u2019s special concern for children,\u201d <em>Kent v. United States, </em>383 U.S. 541, 554, 86 S.Ct. 1045, 16 L.Ed.2d 84 (1966), and \u201cprovide judicial proce<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>dures through which the provisions of th[ese] law[s] are executed and enforced and in which the parties are assured a fair hearing and their constitutional and other rights are recognized and enforced.\u201d Code \u00a7 16.1-227(2). At a transfer hearing, the juvenile judge answers the \u201c \u2018critically important\u2019 question whether a child will be deprived of the special protections and provisions\u201d of the juvenile court system and determines \u201cvitally important statutory rights of the juvenile.\u201d <em>Kent, </em>383 U.S. at 553, 556, 86 S.Ct. 1045. Therefore, the procedures for transfer must contain \u201cprocedural regularity sufficient in the particular circumstances to satisfy the basic requirements of due process and fairness, as well as compliance with the statutory requirements of\u2019 notice to the proper and necessary parties. <em>Id. </em>at 553, 86 S.Ct. 1045; <em>see In re Gault, </em>387 U.S. 1, 33, 87 S.Ct. 1428, 18 L.Ed.2d 527 (1967). \u201c[T]he requirement that the parents of [a juvenile] defendant charged with a crime have notification of the time and place of his [or her] trial and an opportunity to be present has remained constant.\u201d <em>Jones v. Commonwealth, </em>213 Va. 425, 428, 192 S.E.2d 775, 777 (1972).</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">In <em>Karim v. Commonwealth, </em>22 Va.App. 767, 473 S.E.2d 103 (1996) <em>(en banc), </em>we held that the provisions of Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-263 and 16.1-264, \u201crelating to procedures for instituting proceedings against juveniles, are mandatory and jurisdictional,\u201d and the failure to \u201cstrictly follow\u201d these notice procedures denies a juvenile defendant \u201ca substantive right and the constitutional guarantee of due process.\u201d 22 Va.App. at 779, 473 S.E.2d at 108-09. In particular, Code \u00a7 16.1-263 provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-6\">A. After a petition is filed, the court shall direct the issuance of summonses, one directed to the juvenile, if the juvenile is twelve or more years of age, and another to the <em>parents, </em>guardian, legal custodian or other person standing in loco parentis, and such other persons as appear to the court to be proper or necessary parties to the proceedings. The summons shall require them to appear personally before the court at the time fixed to answer or testify as to the allegations of the petition. Where the custodian is sum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>moned and such person is not the parent of the juvenile in question, the parent shall also be served with a summons. The court may direct that other proper or necessary parties to the proceedings be notified of the pendency of the ease, the charge and the time and place for the hearing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-5\">B. The summons shall advise the parties of their right to counsel as provided in \u00a7 16.1-266. A copy of the petition shall accompany each summons for the initial proceedings. The summons shall include notice that in the event that the juvenile is committed to the Department or to a secure local facility, the parent or other person legally obligated to care for and support the juvenile may be required to pay a reasonable sum for support and treatment of the juvenile pursuant to \u00a7 16.1-290. Notice of subsequent proceedings shall be provided to all parties in interest. In all cases where a party is represented by counsel and counsel has been provided with a copy of the petition and due notice as to time, date and place of the hearing, such action shall be deemed due notice to such party, unless such counsel has notified the court that he no longer represents such party.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-6\">sf: * * sfc * <em>*</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-7\">E. No such summons or notification shall be required if the judge shall certify on the record that the identity of a parent or guardian is not reasonably ascertainable. An affidavit of the mother that the identity of the father is not reasonably ascertainable shall be sufficient evidence of this fact, provided there is no other evidence before the court which would refute such an affidavit.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">Code \u00a7 16.1-263 (emphasis added). In addition, Code \u00a7 16.1-264(A) provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-10\">If after reasonable effort a party other than the person who is the subject of the petition cannot be found or his post-office address cannot be ascertained, whether he is within or without the Commonwealth, the court may order service of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>the summons upon him by publication in accordance with the provisions of \u00a7\u00a7 8.01-316 and 8.01-317.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">A plain reading of Code \u00a7\u00a7 16.1-263 and 16.1-264 manifests legislative intent that both parents be notified and dispenses with this requirement only when the trial judge has certified on the record that the identity of a parent is not reasonably ascertainable. The trial judge made no such certification on this record. Indeed, the record contains no evidence that any attempt was made by the trial judge or the Commonwealth to ascertain the address of the biological father. In fact, at the hearing on Baker\u2019s motion to dismiss or remand back to the juvenile court, the Commonwealth \u201cconceded that there was no attempt to give the [biological father] notice.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b356-7\">At the least, the Commonwealth was required to make a reasonable inquiry as to the address of Baker\u2019s biological father, and, if the address could not be ascertained \u201c[a]fter reasonable effort,\u201d to effect service of the summons by publication. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 16.1-264. <em>Cf. Unknown Father of Baby Girl Janet v. Division of Social Services, </em>15 Va.App. 110, 116, 422 S.E.2d 407, 410-11 (1992) (noting that where \u201cthe mother\u2019s testimony fails to suggest even a clue as to the father\u2019s identity, his whereabouts, or that a reasonable inquiry or search would successfully identify and locate him,\u201d the trial judge properly certified on the record that father\u2019s identity was \u201cnot reasonably ascertainable\u201d). We disagree with the Commonwealth\u2019s assertion, made at oral argument, that the time requirements of an order of publication \u201cin accordance with the provisions of [Code] \u00a7\u00a7 8.01-316 and 8.01-317,\u201d <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 16.1-264, cannot be reconciled with the twenty-one day time limitation specified in Code \u00a7 16.1-277.1. We note that the twenty-one day period in Code \u00a7 16.1-277.1(A) is not absolute because it may be enlarged, when appropriate, by the trial judge pursuant to other provisions of the statute. <em>See </em>Code \u00a7 16.1-277.1(B) (providing for a period of 120 days under specified circumstances) and Code \u00a7 16.1-277.1(D) (stating that \u201c[t]he time limitations provided for in this section may be extended by the court for a reasonable period of time <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"313\">*313</page-number>based upon good cause shown, provided that the basis for such extension is recorded in writing and filed among the papers of the proceedings\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">Without either a certification on the record that the identity of Baker\u2019s father was not reasonably ascertainable or proof of service of the summons upon Baker\u2019s father by publication, the provisions of Code \u00a7 16.1-263(A), requiring service of summonses on the parents of the juvenile, have not been met. \u201cThe provisions in the Code specifying parents of a juvenile as proper and necessary parties who must receive notice are mandatory.\u201d <em>Karim, </em>22 Va.App. at 776, 473 S.E.2d at 107; <em>see Peyton v. French, </em>207 Va. 73, 79, 147 S.E.2d 739, 743 (1966). Noncompliance with these requirements necessitates reversal of Baker\u2019s convictions. <em>See Williams v. Commonwealth, </em>26 Va.App. 776, 781, 497 S.E.2d 156, 159 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">We further note that the history of the amendments to Code \u00a7 16.1-264 supports the foregoing analysis. Prior to 1991, Code \u00a7 16.1-264 provided in part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-7\">A. If a party designated in \u00a7 16.1-263 A to be served with a summons can be found within the Commonwealth, the summons shall be served upon him in person. <em>However, service of the summons on one parent in person shall be deemed sufficient service on both parents in cases where (i) the child is alleged to be in need of services or delinquent and custody of the child is not in issue and, (ii) the serving officer has reasonable grounds to believe the parents are living together in the same household, provided a copy of the summons is served on the parent who was not served in person by substituted service as prescribed in \u00a7 8.01-296(2) and the serving officer notes on the return that he believes the parents are living together.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b357-8\">(Emphasis added). In 1991, the legislature deleted the italicized portion of the above quoted statutory language. The statute currently provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b357-9\">If a party designated in \u00a7 16.1-263 A to be served with a summons can be found within the Commonwealth, the sum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"314\">*314</page-number>mons shall be served upon him in person or by substituted service as prescribed in \u00a7 8.01-296(2).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b358-6\">Code \u00a7 16.1-264(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b358-7\">When we construe statutes, \u201cwe assume that the legislature\u2019s amendments to the law are purposeful and not unnecessary.\u201d <em>Broadnax v. Commonwealth, </em>24 Va.App. 808, 814, 485 S.E.2d 666, 669 (1997). \u201cWe will not construe legislative action in a manner that would ascribe to the General Assembly a futile gesture. Legislative amendments are presumed as intended to effect a change in the law.\u201d <em>Shaw v. Commonwealth, </em>9 Va.App. 331, 334, 387 S.E.2d 792, 794 (1990); <em>see Wisniewski v. Johnson, </em>223 Va. 141, 144, 286 S.E.2d 223, 224-25 (1982). The General Assembly, by deleting the language \u201cservice of the summons on one parent in person shall be deemed sufficient service on both parents,\u201d clearly intended that such service would no longer be sufficient notice to the \u201cparents\u201d of the juvenile. This amendment to Code \u00a7 16.1-264 and the plain language of Code \u00a7 16.1-263(A) that the \u201cparents\u201d of the juvenile must be served with summonses evince the legislature\u2019s intent that <em>both </em>parents (unless the identity of one parent is not reasonably ascertainable, <em>see </em>Code \u00a7 16.1-263(E)) be notified of the juvenile proceedings initiated against their child. The Commonwealth\u2019s argument that service of a summons on one parent is sufficient is contrary to the General Assembly\u2019s amendment to Code \u00a7 16.1-264, which deleted that very language. \u201cWe will not read into the statute language which the legislature purposefully deleted.\u201d <em>Shaw, </em>9 Va.App. at 334, 387 S.E.2d at 794.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-8\">Moreover, Code \u00a7 16.1-263(E) states that \u201c[a]n affidavit of the mother that the identity of the father is not reasonably ascertainable shall be sufficient evidence of this fact.\u201d If the legislature intended to require or permit service of a summons upon only one parent, that part of subsection (E) relating to \u201can affidavit of the mother\u201d would be unnecessary because the statute presupposes the mother is obviously present and available for service. To interpret subsection (A) as requiring notice to only one parent would render the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>language of subsection (E) superfluous and meaningless. \u201cUnder well-established principles of statutory interpretation, where possible, every word of a statute must be given meaning.\u201d <em>Gray v. Graves Mountain Lodge, </em>26 Va.App. 350, 356, 494 S.E.2d 866, 869 (1998); <em>see Monument Assocs. v. Arlington County Bd., </em>242 Va. 145, 149, 408 S.E.2d 889, 891 (1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b359-5\">Because the notice of the initiation of juvenile proceedings was not properly-served on the required parties, the transfer of jurisdiction was ineffectual and the subsequent convictions are void. Accordingly, we reverse Baker\u2019s convictions and remand to the circuit court with instructions to remand to the juvenile and domestic relations district court to take further action if the Commonwealth be so advised.</p>\n<p id=\"b359-6\">\n<em>Reversed and remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b355-11\">. This subsection was amended in 1997, after the trial of this case, to allow a judge to certify on the record that a parent or guardian's identify or <em>location </em>is not reasonably ascertainable.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
