Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">On February 9, 1998, General Trading, an automobile wholesaler, sold an automobile to Darrell Ley, Charlie Suqua, and Sunnyside Auto Sales for $1,925. On February 1, 1995, General Trading sold two automobiles to Tom Lawson and Coeburn Auto Mart for a total of $7,460. In both transactions, the purchasers paid by check, and the checks were returned for insufficient funds.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">On February 24, 1997, General Trading obtained a judgment against Darrell Ley for $1,925 and a judgment against Tom Lawson for $7,460. On April 16, 1997, General Trading filed with the Board separate Judgment Claim Requests for each claim. In these Judgment Claim Requests, General Trading sought compensation from the Fund for the judgments it had obtained.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">The Board denied both of General Trading\u2019s claims on the basis that General Trading was not eligible for compensation under Code \u00a7 46.2-1527.8. General Trading appealed the Board\u2019s decisions to the Circuit Court of Fairfax County. After hearing oral argument, the circuit court affirmed the Board\u2019s decisions, reasoning that Code \u00a7 46.2-1527.3 \u201cdoes not protect the seller, but, rather, only the purchasers.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">General Trading contends the Board erred in interpreting Code \u00a7 46.2-1527.3 to limit recovery to persons who buy or acquire possession of motor vehicles, and to deny recovery to wholesale sellers of motor vehicles. \u201c[W]hen, as here, the question [presented] involves a statutory interpretation issue, \u2018little deference is required to be accorded the agency decision\u2019 because the issue falls outside the agency\u2019s specialized competence.\u201d <em>Sims Wholesale Co. v. Brown-Forman Corp., </em>251 Va. 398, 404, 468 S.E.2d 905, 908 (1996) (quoting <em>Johnston-Willis, Ltd. v. Kenley, </em>6 Va.App. 231, 246, 369 S.E.2d 1, 9 (1988)). \u201cIn sum, pure statutory interpretation is the prerogative of the judiciary.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citing <em>Hampton Roads Sanitation Dist. Comm\u2019n v. City of Chesapeake, </em>218 Va. 696, 702, 240 S.E.2d 819, 823 (1978)).</p>\n<p id=\"b311-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"267\">*267</page-number>\u201c \u201cWhen the wording of a statute is clear and unambiguous, its plain meaning is to be accepted without resort to rules of interpretation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Kossman v. Commonwealth, Dept. of Motor Vehicles, </em>24 Va.App. 762, 766, 485 S.E.2d 643, 645 (1997) (quoting <em>Commonwealth, Dep\u2019t of Mines, Minerals &amp; Energy v. May Bros., </em>11 Va.App. 115, 118, 396 S.E.2d 695, 696 (1990)). Code \u00a7 46.2-1527.3 provides as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-4\">Whenever any person is awarded a final judgment in a court of competent jurisdiction in the Commonwealth for (i) any loss or damage in connection with the purchase of a motor vehicle by reason of any fraud practiced on him or fraudulent representation made to him by a licensed or registered motor vehicle dealer or one of a dealer\u2019s salespersons acting for the dealer or within the scope of his employment, or (ii) any loss or damage by reason of the violation by a dealer or salesperson of any of the provisions of this chapter in connection with the purchase of a motor vehicle, on or after January 1, 1989, the judgment creditor may file a verified claim with the Board, requesting payment from the Fund of the amount unpaid on the judgment. The claim shall be filed with the Board no sooner than thirty days and no later than twelve months after the judgment becomes final.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-5\">On or after the effective date of this act, the Board shall only consider for payment claims submitted by retail purchasers of motor vehicles, and for purchases of motor vehicles by licensed or registered motor vehicle dealers who contribute to the Fund.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">To bring itself within the ambit of the protections of the statute, General Trading argues that the word \u201cpurchases,\u201d as used in the phrase \u201cthe Board shall only consider for payment claims submitted ... for purchases of motor vehicles by licensed or registered motor vehicle dealers who contribute to the Fund,\u201d authorizes recovery by either the buyer or the seller and that we should hold that a \u201cpurchase[ ]\u201d involves both parties. We reject this analysis in light of the well-settled principles applicable in determining the legislature\u2019s intent in enacting law.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"268\">*268</page-number>\u201c \u2018It is our duty to take the words which the legislature has seen fit to employ and give to them their usual and ordinary signification, and having thus ascertained the legislative intent, to give effect to <em>it...\u2019\u201d Commonwealth v. Sanderson, </em>170 Va. 33, 38-39, 195 S.E. 516, 519 (1938) (quoting <em>Saville v. Virginia Railway &amp; Power Co., </em>114 Va. 444, 453, 76 S.E. 954, 957 (1913)). In the absence of any specific indication to the contrary, words used in a statute will be given their common, ordinary, and accepted meaning. <em>Woolfolk v. Commonwealth, </em>18 Va.App. 840, 847, 447 S.E.2d 530, 533 (1994) (citing <em>Huffman v. Kite, </em>198 Va. 196, 199, 93 S.E.2d 328, 331 (1956)).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">The statute allows recovery only for claims submitted for \u201cpurchases of motor vehicles by licensed or registered motor vehicle dealers who contribute to the Fund.\u201d The ordinary definition of \u201cpurchase\u201d is \u201cthe acquiring of title to or property in anything for a price.\u201d <em>Webster\u2019s Third New International Dictionary </em>1845 (1981). Giving the term \u201cpurchase\u201d its usual and ordinary meaning, we hold that the legislature intended to limit the protections of the statute to those who acquire the property in question by purchase. This holding is consistent with the Supreme Court\u2019s explanation of the General Assembly\u2019s intent in enacting the statute: \u201cto afford uniform protection to those who purchase vehicles at wholesale auctions, <em>for the ultimate benefit of consumers who would purchase the vehicles at retail.\u201d Fredericksburg Auto Auction, Inc. v. Department of Motor Vehicles, </em>242 Va. 42, 46, 406 S.E.2d 23, 26 (1991) (emphasis added).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"269\">*269</page-number>General Trading argues in the alternative that the word \u201cpurchase\u201d as used in Code \u00a7 46.2-1527.3 is ambiguous, requiring this Court to apply the rules of statutory construction to determine its meaning. \u201cLanguage is ambiguous if it admits of being understood in more than one way or refers to two or more things simultaneously.\u201d <em>Brown v. Lukhard, </em>229 Va. 316, 321, 330 S.E.2d 84, 87 (1985) (citing <em>Lincoln Nat\u2019l Life Ins. Co. v. Commonwealth Corrugated Container Corp., </em>229 Va. 132, 136-37, 327 S.E.2d 98, 101 (1985)). We reject this argument because we find that the plain meaning of the statute is capable of only one interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">Given our interpretation of the plain meaning of Code \u00a7 46.2-1527.3, General Trading is ineligible to recover; General Trading was the seller rather than the- purchaser in the transactions at issue here. The agency and circuit court properly denied compensation from the Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">\n<em>Affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b312-6\">. The issue before the Court in <em>Fredericksburg Auto Auction, </em>242 Va. at 45, 406 S.E.2d at 25, was a due process challenge to the 1988 amendments to the statute. The Supreme Court of Virginia reviewed the purposes of the statutory scheme as a necessary part of its reasoning that the statute was rationally related to its legitimate legislative objectives. <em>Id. </em>at 47, 406 S.E.2d at 26. We find that the amendments to the statute following the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Fredericksburg Auto Auction </em>did not alter the statutory purpose; if anything, the amendments strengthened the purposes articulated by the Supreme Court. <em>See 1995 </em>Va. Acts, ch. 767, 816; 1994 Va. Acts, ch. 478; 1991 Va. Acts, ch. 654.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
