There was ample evidence to .establish that the defendant used force in an effort to prevent or to overcome one complainant\u2019s resistance to defendant\u2019s retention of the stolen property and that defendant caused physical injury <em>(People v Thomas, </em>226 AD2d 120, <em>lv denied </em>88 NY2d 887). We see no reason to disturb the jury\u2019s credibility determinations concerning the manner in which the complainant was injured.</p>\n<p id=\"b143-7\">We perceive no abuse of sentencing discretion.
