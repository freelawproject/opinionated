S. Co., </em>216 AD2d 556). The plaintiffs demonstrated both a justifiable excuse for the four- to five-month delay in seeking to restore the action by reason of their counsel\u2019s terminal illness, and a good and meritorious cause of action against the defendant Homedco, Inc. <em>(see, Penn v American Airlines, </em>192 AD2d 385, 386; <em>Smigel v Town of Rensselaerville, </em>125 AD2d 847; <em>Norowitz v Ponconco, Inc., </em>96 AD2d 581). Furthermore, the motion practice and their counsel\u2019s efforts to acquire necessary documentation subsequent to the time the case was marked off the trial calendar on March 21, 1994, evinces an intent to pursue the action rather than abandon it <em>(see, Beltrani v Mirabile, </em>141 AD2d 688, 689; <em>Sheehan v Hollywood, </em>112 AD2d 211). Lastly, no substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>prejudice has been demonstrated as a result of the delay in prosecuting this action. Bracken, J. P., O\u2019Brien, Santucci, Friedmann and Goldstein, JJ., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
