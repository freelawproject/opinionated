The court also awarded Balboa $75,000 in profits lost when three of the defendants sold Balboa\u2019s computer software enhancements.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Balboa cross-appeals from the portions of the judgment in favor of Barry Maashoff.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1181-7\">In the published part of the opinion, we address the impact of federal copyright law upon California law regarding unfair competition. To the extent the unfair competition claims rest on trade secret and breach of confidential or fiduciary relationships, they survive a preemption challenge. In the unpublished parts of the opinion we find substantial evidence of breached duties of fidelity and confidentiality, we uphold the trial court\u2019s appointment of an expert and calculation of damages, and in considering <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1332\">*1332</page-number>Balboa\u2019s cross-appeal, we shall reverse the trial court\u2019s judgment in favor of defendant Barry MaashofF.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-5\">Background</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-6\">Collateral protection insurance covers a lender\u2019s interest in the property that secures a loan. Under typical loan agreements, if the borrower fails to insure the collateral for physical damage, the lender may purchase a policy insuring its security interest and charge the premiums to the borrower.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1182-7\">In 1972, Jack Nelson began a loan collateral tracking service in Stockton. He formed the company eventually known as Collateral Protection Insurance Services (CPIS) to help banks and credit unions keep track of their collateral\u2019s insurance status.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As insurance agents, Nelson and company could then sell insurance for any uninsured collateral.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-8\">The laborious business of tracking thousands of loans on three by five index cards lent itself readily to computerization. By 1979, CPIS had hired programmer Martin Atherton to design software for a Hewlett-Packard computer. That same year, insurance agent Barry MaashofF joined CPIS as its president and manager of the Stockton tracking center. Also that year, to finance the Atherton system, CPIS borrowed $500,000 from Balboa Insurance Company. At the same time, CPIS agreed to sell Balboa\u2019s collateral insurance policies to its tracking customers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-9\">By June 1980, CPIS and its agents owed Balboa \u201cseveral hundred thousand dollars\u201d in premiums for collateral insurance policies placed with Balboa for various lenders. Although CPIS had collected the money from its lenders, it had diverted the funds owed Balboa to \u201c[ojther purposes and other uses than remitting to Balboa[.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1182-10\">To resolve this \u201cout of trust\u201d situation, in June 1980, Balboa required Nelson, MaashofF and other CPIS investors to sign personal guaranties for $1 million. In addition, Balboa required CPIS and its principals to secure the guarantees with the computer tracking system. Finally, Balboa required the new joint venturers of the restructured Stockton service center to write all their business with Balboa.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1183-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1333\">*1333</page-number>In January 1981, Nelson or Maashoff told Balboa that CPIS and its principals could not make even interest payments on the outstanding debt. As a result, Balboa, CPIS, and the joint venturers negotiated four agreements signed in March 1981. At trial, the parties submitted these agreements as joint exhibits and refer to them here by their exhibit numbers. For convenience, we adopt their nomenclature.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-5\">In exhibit 1(a), CPIS gave Balboa\u2019s affiliate, Newport Management Company (NMC), a perpetual, nonexclusive license to use the computer tracking software.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> As part of the license, CPIS authorized NMC to modify the software as NMC saw fit. CPIS agreed that \u201c[a]ny modification made by NMC shall remain the property of NMC.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-6\">In exchange for the license, NMC agreed to pay CPIS \u201cspecial override\u201d commissions. Memorialized in exhibit 1(b), this commission agreement applied to business written on 20 accounts listed on \u201cExhibit A\u201d attached to the override agreement. NMC agreed to pay CPIS between 1 and 5 percent of net insurance premiums received from Exhibit A policies.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1183-7\">In exhibit 1(c), Balboa released Nelson from his obligations as one of CPIS\u2019s guarantors. In exchange, he agreed not to cause any of the 20 accounts listed in Exhibit A or any of an additional 92 accounts listed on an attached Exhibit B to cancel or lapse for 6 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-8\">Finally, in exhibit 1(d), CPIS agreed to transfer to Balboa its rights to normal commissions from the Exhibit A accounts. CPIS also promised \u201cthat it will take no action to cause such policies of insurance to be can-celled, lapse or otherwise terminate.\u201d In exchange, Balboa agreed to pay CPIS a 5 percent servicing override commission and to release CPIS from its obligations under the 1980 $1 million note and security agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1183-9\">In exhibit 1(d), Balboa also agreed to pay a similar 5 percent commission for three years on the ninety-two Exhibit B accounts. In March 1984, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1334\">*1334</page-number>however, the commissions dropped to 1 percent and expired completely five years later. CFIA also signed this agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-4\">Shortly after the parties negotiated the four agreements, NMC took over the Stockton loan tracking center\u2019s operations. NMC hired Maashoff as its employee to manage the center. Maashoff headed the Stockton service center until September 1981. At that time, he left Balboa\u2019s employment to concentrate on selling collateral protection insurance nationwide. In mid-December 1982, Maashoff returned as a \u201cmanagement consultant\u201d to direct the Stockton center\u2019s attempts to run more efficiently and smoothly.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-5\">After it took over the Stockton center\u2019s operations, NMC continued to improve the software licensed from CPIS. It hired the software\u2019s original developer, Martin Atherton, to make some of these enhancements. Balboa\u2019s employees made others. Maashoff was involved in many of the changes. By 1983, the system\u2019s improvements and other changes allowed the Stockton center to become profitable for the first time.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-6\">NMC\u2019s assumption of management duties at the Stockton center and the transfer of the Exhibit A accounts to Balboa reduced CPIS to collecting its service commissions and marketing its software to other potential loan tracking services. Unfortunately for CPIS, when it licensed its software to NMC in March 1981, both CPIS and Atherton had neglected to keep a copy of the base system.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-7\">In 1983, CPIS licensed its software to American Bankers for $ 150,000. To reconstruct the March 1981 base system, Atherton used a copy of Balboa\u2019s system as of September 1981. The September 1981 tape, however, contained extensive changes made by Balboa to the base system. Despite Atherton\u2019s efforts to delete these enhancements, the copy of the system delivered in May 1983 to American Bankers contained some. After discussions with Balboa, Atherton attempted again to remove all of Balboa\u2019s program material. Even after delivery of the amended tape in late 1983, at least one of Balboa\u2019s programs remained in the American Bankers system.</p>\n<p id=\"b1184-8\">By late 1983, while still the \u201cmanagement consultant\u201d streamlining NMC\u2019s Stockton center operations, Maashoff began preparations to form a competing insurance tracking service. He feared that Balboa was going to transfer all of the Stockton center\u2019s business to its own system in Irvine. In addition, he feared that Balboa was going to sell insurance directly to the lending institutions. He felt that Balboa would use these actions to reduce <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1335\">*1335</page-number>or eliminate commissions that CPIS and CFIA might otherwise earn.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> Accordingly, in January 1984, CPIS and Trans Global formed a joint venture to establish the Trans Global Financial Service Center in Stockton.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-5\">That same month, CPIS licensed its tracking software to Trans Global. On January 30, 1984, Trans Global hired Maashoff to manage the Trans Global center.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> He began planning for the new center\u2019s building and equipment. He also planned the center\u2019s personnel requirements. As part of his efforts to staff the new center, Maashoff discussed the strengths and weaknesses of Balboa\u2019s employees with Jan Mehlhaff, a department supervisor at Balboa\u2019s Stockton service center. Maashoff also began to plan to move accounts from Balboa\u2019s tracking service to the new Trans Global center. Fearing that Balboa might find some way to stop it, Maashoff, CPIS, and Trans Global kept their plans secret from Balboa.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-6\">During April and May of 1984, events came to a head. In early April, Maashoff met with Balboa\u2019s head, Jack Trapp, to propose a deal. Maashoff told Trapp that Balboa could service in its Irvine center any accounts it wanted and that Trans Global would service the rest in its new Stockton center for a commission. A few days later, before he could respond definitively, Trapp resigned as Balboa\u2019s president.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-7\">Trans Global then moved forward in its plans to compete with Balboa. Trans Global arranged to sell collateral protection insurance from two other carriers. Nelson and Maashoff had a phone line for Trans Global installed in Balboa\u2019s Stockton tracking center.</p>\n<p id=\"b1185-8\">In late April and early May, Nelson solicited for Trans Global and the new carriers some of the Exhibit A accounts that CPIS had assigned to Balboa in 1981. Maashoff felt that they were just taking back these \u201ccustomers that belonged to [us.]\u201d Many came over. Trans Global promised these customers that the transfer from Balboa to Trans Global meant only a telephone number change; the tracking system, personnel, even the mailbox would remain the same.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1336\">*1336</page-number>In April, Maashoff announced the Trans Global center\u2019s opening to Balboa\u2019s employees. He hoped \u201cto solidify a loyal base of employees for Trans Global in the event that [Balboa] refused to follow [Maashoff\u2019s] proposal [to take over Balboa\u2019s accounts] . . . .\u2019\u2019He directly approached department supervisors Mehlhaff and Fenley as well as employee Jodie Thomas. He successfully lured Mehlhaff. He told other key Balboa employees of the availability of jobs with Trans Global.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-5\">In early May, Maashoff had one of Balboa\u2019s programmers, Susan McCrory, spend two weeks of her vacation working at Trans Global\u2019s new center. Maashoff had her complete programs she had been writing for Balboa so that both Trans Global and Balboa could use them.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1186-6\">The developments\u2019 pace continued to accelerate in early May. At that time, Maashoff learned that Balboa was going to close the Stockton center and transfer the business to its Irvine system. Maashoff encouraged Balboa supervisor Darryl Fenley to organize a walkout of Balboa\u2019s remaining employees. <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Maashoff also urged Balboa\u2019s employees to forward tapes containing certain client information from Balboa to Trans Global without notifying Balboa immediately that the clients were leaving.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-7\">On May 10, 1984, Balboa sued for an injunction and damages against Trans Global. Among other things, its complaint asked the court to enjoin Trans Global from: 1) using or transferring Balboa\u2019s enhancements to the \u201csupport system and software\u201d; 2) \u201cusing . . . any confidential information obtained from [Balboa]\u201d; and 3) soliciting Balboa\u2019s customers, agents, or employees. In late May and early June, the court granted preliminary relief against Trans Global\u2019s use of Balboa\u2019s software and confidential information.</p>\n<p id=\"b1186-8\">Trans Global then answered and cross-complained for breach of contract, breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and abuse of process. The court sustained with leave to amend Balboa\u2019s demurrer to the abuse of process and breach of contract claims. Upon Trans Global\u2019s failure to amend timely, the court dismissed these two causes of action. Balboa eventually dismissed its \u201cbreached good faith covenant\u201d claim, raising the argument solely as an affirmative defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1337\">*1337</page-number>On July 31, 1984, each side deposited in court a copy of their computer software source codes. They stipulated that such software was \u201cvaluable and confidential trade secrets which are the essence of the competitive advantage of their respective businesses\u201d and agreed to limit disclosure only to litigation needs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-4\">Trial eventually began April 16, 1985. The court trial extended over 23 days. The evidence conflicted substantially.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-5\">Following trial, on July 5, 1985, the court appointed Larry Dold to analyze the testimony and exhibits regarding the software copying. Dold outlined his conclusions in a letter to the court. The parties later examined him at a hearing on the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-6\">In his letter, Dold concluded that: \u201c1. Many of the fixes, or corrections of errors, implemented by Balboa after March 1981 remain in the Trans Global program. 2. Some of the enhancements and changes made by Balboa after March 1981 are still in the Trans Global programs. 3. Trans Global requested Susan McCrory to not only come to work for them during 1984, but to also bring with her copies of programs that she was currently working on at Balboa.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-7\">At the hearing, he amplified his conclusions. He noted that the bare number of program lines did not necessarily reveal a given modification\u2019s importance. He also doubted strongly that Atherton\u2019s memory could account for the extent of duplication between the systems. He also testified that Atherton could only have independently recreated the extensive modifications with great difficulty.</p>\n<p id=\"b1187-8\">The court issued its intended decision on December 11, 1985. The court announced its intent to find that the complaint stated one cause of action, for unfair competition.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The court tentatively found that Trans Global and the other defendants competed unfairly in three ways: 1) by soliciting the Exhibit A accounts; 2) by hiring away Balboa\u2019s key employees; and 3) by selling and using Balboa\u2019s software modifications without authorization. The court rejected the defendants\u2019 affirmative defenses.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> It tentatively <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1338\">*1338</page-number>awarded Balboa $3,721,000 as lost profits and $150,000 for the unauthorized sale of the Balboa software modifications.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-5\">The court issued its statement of decision on July 18, 1986. In addition to the three unfair competition grounds tentatively found, the court also concluded that the defendants competed unfairly when they \u201cutilized the managerial efforts of Barry Maashoff to create a competing loan tracking service for Trans Global.\u201d The court left intact its damages calculation. The court refused to find either Maashoff or Nelson liable individually. On July 22, 1986, the court entered judgment and these timely appeals followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-6\">Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-7\">I. Copyright Law Does Not Preempt Unfair Competition Claims Based on Trade Secret and Breaches of Confidence or Fiduciary Duty</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-10\">A. <em>Defendants May Raise Their Preemption Argument</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1188-11\">Defendants contend that federal copyright law preempts Balboa\u2019s unfair competition claim. They admit they did not raise this defense below. Nevertheless, they claim that the copyright preemption defense goes to the trial court\u2019s jurisdiction. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-12\">As Balboa notes, normally we do not consider affirmative defenses not tendered below. (See, e.g., <em>Roystar </em>v. <em>Montanez </em>(1982) 134 Cal.App.3d 362, 366 [184 Cal.Rptr. 560].) Nevertheless, as Witkin notes, exceptions exist. \u201cThe rule that the appellate court will not consider points not raised below . . . is limited to matters involving only the rights and interests of the litigant which could have been cured in the trial court. It does not apply to the following: (1) A noncurable defect of substance where the question is one of law, <em>such as lack of jurisdiction ... or complete failure to state a cause of action. . . </em>.\u201d (9 Witkin, Cal. Procedure (3d ed. 1985) Appeal, \u00a7315, p. 326, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1188-13\">Here, both of the above mentioned exceptions apply. First, to the extent defendants establish preemption, by definition no state cause of action exists. Second, federal law gives exclusive jurisdiction over copyright disputes to the federal courts. (28 U.S.C.S. \u00a7 1338(a).) A successful copyright preemption argument would eliminate the trial court\u2019s very power to enter <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1339\">*1339</page-number>judgment over the defendants here. Accordingly, we shall consider the preemption argument.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1189-5\">B. <em>Copyright Law Does Not Preempt Unfair Competition Claims Based on Trade Secret and Breaches of Confidence or Fiduciary Duty.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1189-6\">Federal law expressly preempts state laws that aim to protect \u201clegal or equitable rights that are equivalent to any of the exclusive rights within the general scope of copyright as specified by [17 U.S.C.S. \u00a7 106]. . . . [After January 1, 1978] no person is entitled to any such right or equivalent right in any such work under the common law or statutes of any State.\u201d (17 U.S.C.S. \u00a7 301(a).) (Further citations to undesignated code sections refer to this title.) At the same time, federal law allows states to regulate \u201cactivities violating legal or equitable rights that are not equivalent to any of the exclusive rights within the general scope of copyright as specified by [17 U.S.C.S. \u00a7 106].\u201d (17 U.S.C.S. \u00a7 301(b)(3).) Moreover, the statute that gives the federal courts exclusive jurisdiction over copyright claims allows jurisdiction over state law \u201cunfair competition\u201d claims when joined with a substantial and related claim under copyright laws. (28 U.S.C.S. \u00a7 1338(b).) Thus, copyright\u2019s preemptive effect on a state unfair competition claim depends upon whether the state law protects \u201clegal or equitable rights that are equivalent\u201d to the exclusive rights specified in section 106.</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-7\">Section 106 generally gives a copyright owner exclusive right: \u201c(1) to reproduce the copyrighted work \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 ; [1J] (2) to prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work; [fl] (3) to distribute copies ... of the copyrighted work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or lending; [fl] (4) [if applicable] to perform the copyrighted works publicly; and [U] (5) [if applicable] to display the copyrighted work publicly.\u201d (17 U.S.C.S. \u00a7 106.)  Borrowing section 106\u2019s language, Professor Nimmer summarizes: \u201ca right which is \u2018equivalent to copyright\u2019 is one which is infringed by the mere act of reproduction, performance, distribution or display.\u201d (1 Nimmer on Copyright (Rel. 23) \u00a7 1.01 [B], at p. 1-12 [fns. deleted; hereinafter, Nimmer].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1189-9\">Nimmer elaborates: \u201cIf under state law the act of reproduction, performance, distribution or display, no matter whether the law includes all such acts or only some, will <em>in itself </em>infringe the state created right, then such <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1340\">*1340</page-number>right is preempted. But if other elements are required, in addition to or instead of, the acts of reproduction, performance, distribution or display, in order to constitute a state created cause of action, then the right does not lie \u2018within the general scope of copyright,\u2019 and there is no preemption.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1-13 [italics in original, fns. deleted].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-5\">Courts have denominated Nimmer\u2019s analysis the \u201c \u2018extra element\u2019 test.\u201d (See, e.g., <em>Gladstone </em>v. <em>Hillel </em>(1988) 203 Cal.App.3d 977, 987 [250 Cal.Rptr. 372].) \u201cWhile generally accepting this test, the courts have demanded that the extra element \u2018must be one that changes the nature of the action so that it is <em>qualitatively </em>different from a copyright infringement claim.\u2019 [Citations, italics in source of quotation.]\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1190-6\"> We assume strictly arguendo that Balboa could have received copyright protection for its software modifications. (See, e.g., <em>Whelan Associates, Inc. </em>v. <em>Jaslow Dental Laboratory </em>(3d Cir. 1986) 797 F.2d 1222, 1229-1242; <em>Apple Computer, Inc. </em>v. <em>Franklin Computer Corp. </em>(3d Cir. 1983) 714 F.2d 1240, 1248 [70 A.L.R.Fed. 153].)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Copyright law would thus have protected Balboa from unauthorized duplication or transfer of its programs by Maashoff, Atherton or CPIS.  To survive preemption, Balboa\u2019s complaint must allege an element beyond \u201cunauthorized duplication or transfer.\u201d Moreover, that element must make the state claim \u201cqualitatively different from a copyright infringement claim.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1190-7\">We turn first to the complaint itself. After a 23-day trial, the court below concluded that the complaint stated only a cause of action for \u201cunfair competition.\u201d<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Admittedly, the defendants\u2019 failure to raise its defense below prevented the trial court from analyzing the complaint under copyright preemption law. Nevertheless, two reasons make the court\u2019s use of the unfair competition label unfortunate.</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1341\">*1341</page-number>First, it merely begs the preemption question: does copyright preempt <em>these kinds </em>of unfairly competitive acts merely because they involve computer software?  \u201cUnfair competition\u201d includes a broad range of claims. At best, copyright preempts only some of the claims included in the term \u201cunfair competition.\u201d (See, e.g., <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Weinstein </em>(S.D.N.Y. 1984) 578 F.Supp. 1297, 1306-1308 [unfair competition preempted only to extent that plaintiffs seek to recover profits defendant derived from unauthorized use of ideas; \u201cpalming off\u201d branch of unfair competition law not preempted; breach of confidence not preempted]; see also <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Time Life Films </em>(2d Cir. 1986) 784 F.2d 44, 53 [unfair competition preempted to extent plaintiff seeks protection against copying; breach of confidence not preempted].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-4\">The breadth and analytical vagueness of unfair competition law complicates the preemption analysis greatly. One branch of unfair competition law involves contractual provisions by one party, usually an employee or partner, not to compete against its former employer or partner. (See, e.g., Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 16600-16602; The Law of Competitive Business Practices (Cont.Ed.Bar. 1981) pp. 60-64.) Courts usually construe these covenants narrowly against the former employer or partner. (See, e.g., <em>KGB, Inc. </em>v. <em>Giannoulas </em>(1980) 104 Cal.App.3d 844, 847-855 [164 Cal.Rptr. 571].) Although defendants here cite many of these competitive restraint cases, no such express covenants apply to this case\u2019s resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-5\">Beyond the contractual branch lies a host of often overlapping theories in the tort branch. \u201c[I]n addition to valid contractual provisions [not to compete unfairly], an employer may use one or more tort theories to support an injunction against unfair competitive activities by a former employee: breach of confidential relationship, breach of fiduciary duty, interference with prospective economic advantage, advantageous business relationships [sz'c], and interference with contractual relations.\u201d (The Law of Competitive Business Practices, <em>supra, </em>at p. 63.) Each of these tort theories raises its own issues. As demonstrated more fully below, the complaint arguably implicates at least two of these tort theories.</p>\n<p id=\"b1191-6\">Two other branches of unfair competition also arguably apply. Courts and commentators frequently analyze separately unfair competition and trade secrets protection. (See The Law of Competitive Business Practices at p. 109 [law of trade secrets \u201ccan augment the traditional business torts of unfair competition . . . and breach of fiduciary duty. . . .\u201d]; see also <em>post, </em>fns. 19-22 and accompanying text.) Nevertheless, at bottom, trade secret protection is itself but a branch of unfair competition law. (See, e.g., <em>KGB, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1342\">*1342</page-number><em>Inc., supra, </em>104 Cal.App.3d at p. 850; Comment, <em>Simultaneous Copyright and Trade Secret Protection for Computer Programs </em>(1983) 23 Santa Clara L.Rev. 1037, 1039 [\u201cTrade secrecy is a branch of unfair competition . . . .\u201d]; Scott, Computer Law, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 5.30, pp. 5-27, 5-28 [hereinafter, Scott].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-4\">Common law misappropriation presents a final legal theory under the broad unfair competition umbrella. The doctrine originated in the United States Supreme Court\u2019s decision of <em>International News Service </em>v. <em>Associated Press </em>(1918) 248 U.S. 215 [63 L.Ed. 211, 39 S.Ct. 68, 2 A.L.R. 293], (See Scott, <em>supra, </em>at p. 5-28.)  \u201cIt is normally invoked in an effort to protect something of value that is not covered either by patent or copyright law on the one hand, or by traditional doctrines of unfair competition, such as trade secret theft or breach of confidential relationship, on the other.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 5-27 to 5-28 [fns. deleted].) The cause of action has three elements: \u201c(1) the plaintiff has invested substantial time and money in development of its . . . \u2018property\u2019; (2) the defendant has appropriated the [property] at little or no cost; and (3) the plaintiff has been injured by the defendant\u2019s conduct.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 5-28.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-6\">In addition to common law unfair competition, California has a statute allowing a court to enjoin unfairly competitive acts. (See Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 17200 &amp; 17203.) The remedies available under the statute are \u201ccumulative to each other and to the remedies or penalties available under all other laws of this state.\u201d (Bus. &amp; Prof. Code, \u00a7 17205.) Plaintiffs have not argued here or below that they seek relief under this statute. Accordingly, it appears they have confined their claim to common law unfair competition.</p>\n<p id=\"b1192-7\">For a second reason the trial court\u2019s use of the unfair competition label is unfortunate.  In a proper case, the same conduct may support relief under multiple theories.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> Preemption law, however, requires analysis of each theory to determine whether it contains the necessary qualitatively different extra element distinguishing it from copyright protection. Indeed, courts and commentators have devoted considerable attention to the preemptive effect of copyright on trade secret alone.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Accordingly, in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1343\">*1343</page-number>reviewing plaintiffs\u2019 complaint, we must consider the range of potential theories of unfair competition. Similarly, in reviewing the case law covering the range of unfair competition claims, we must separate the particular theories confronting each court.</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-4\">Construction of a complaint presents a legal question for our independent review. \u201cAs a reviewing court we are not bound by the construction placed by the trial court on the pleadings but must make our own independent judgment thereon, even as to matters not expressly ruled upon by the trial court.\u201d <em>(Miller </em>v. <em>Bakersfield News-Bulletin </em>(1975) 44 Cal.App.3d 899, 901 [119 Cal.Rptr. 92].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-5\">The critical portions of the complaint come in paragraphs 7 through 13. In those paragraphs, Balboa outlines its claims involving its alleged confidential relationship with Maashoff. The allegations first focus on Maashoff\u2019s \u201caccess to confidential information regarding <em>all </em>aspects of the business of [Balboa], . . .\u201d Balboa then gave four examples of Maashoff\u2019s knowledge of confidential information: 1) \u201cthe content, capabilities, and operation of the updated support system and computer software developed by plaintiffs since acquisition of the system March 4, 1981\u201d; 2) \u201cthe commission structure for the agents writing insurance with Balboa . . .\u201d; 3) \u201cthe terms and conditions of employment of Newport\u2019s Stockton employees\u201d; and 4) \u201cthe identity and other information concerning clients and accounts . . . .\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-6\">The complaint then alleges that Maashoff and the other defendants used the confidential information and \u201chave induced agents and lending institution accounts writing insurance with Balboa through Newport as a general agent to transfer business to Trans Global and are attempting to prevail upon other agents to do the same; defendants induced employees of Newport to terminate employment with Newport and to undertake employment with Trans Global and have threatened to induce all of Newport\u2019s employees to leave Newport for Trans Global.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1193-7\">These portions of the complaint reveal Balboa\u2019s principal claimed right and the effect of the defendants\u2019 alleged wrong. First, Balboa claims a right <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1344\">*1344</page-number>in certain confidential information essential to its business. The computer software plays only one of four specified parts of the overall essential information. Indeed, the software itself is identified in tandem with \u201cthe updated support system.\u201d The complaint\u2019s face thus further narrows the software\u2019s importance by distinguishing the support system in general and the software in particular.</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-5\">Second, the harm allegedly done to Balboa comes from the <em>use </em>of this confidential information to lure Balboa\u2019s clients and employees and render valueless the consideration CPIS paid to Balboa in 1981. In these portions of the complaint, Balboa does not allege an improper \u201creproduction, performance, distribution or display.\u201d Rather, in effect, Balboa alleges that the knowledge gained from the confidential information allowed defendants an improper head start in its competition with Balboa.</p>\n<p id=\"b1194-6\">We construe the complaint liberally. In such light, the above portions of the complaint outline claims arguably arising under four unfair competition theories: breach of confidential relationship,<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> breach of fiduciary duty,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1345\">*1345</page-number>trade secrets<footnotemark>22</footnotemark> and misappropriation.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> Paragraphs 7 through 13 of the complaint focus on the use of a wide range of confidential information that generally has nothing to do with the subject of copyright. Moreover, the claimed damages come from loss of key employees and clients.</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-4\">Two other portions of the complaint, however, complicate the analysis. First, in between two of the paragraphs quoted above, Balboa pleaded: \u201cDefendants have sold said support system and software made and owned by plaintiffs to a competitor, American Bankers Life Insurance Company <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1346\">*1346</page-number>and, unless restrained, will sell said support system and software, including the changes made by plaintiffs since March 4, 1981, to other competitors of plaintiffs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-4\">Second, the complaint highlights the twin roles played in defendants\u2019 success by Maashoff\u2019s confidential information and the access to the Balboa tracking system modifications: \u201cEven with months of advance preparation, defendants\u2019 ability to induce the transfer of business from plaintiffs to Trans Global depends upon the ability of defendants to provide support service by use of the modified support system and software developed and owned by plaintiffs since March 4, 1981, and the utilization of confidential information obtained from plaintiffs by Barry Maashoff while employed as a consultant by Newport.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-5\">Unlike the broader confidential information allegations, these two paragraphs focus directly on two unauthorized uses of Balboa\u2019s software improvements. First, the complaint focuses on the sale to American Bankers. In the prayer for relief, Balboa expressly requests damages for the \u201cprofits derived by defendants from sale of all or any part of plaintiffs\u2019 support system and software.\u201d Second, it emphasizes the importance of Trans Global\u2019s own use of Balboa\u2019s software. By these allegations of unauthorized sale and use of software, Balboa has shifted the complaint towards areas within copyright\u2019s traditional domain.</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-6\">The parties\u2019 preemption dispute thus boils down to whether the \u201cconfidential and fiduciary relationship\u201d allegations, including trade secret, properly subsume the \u201cunauthorized use\u201d allegations and add the necessary \u201cqualitatively different element\u201d to escape preemption. For help, we turn to the copyright preemption cases involving state unfair competition claims based upon breached confidential relationships, breached fiduciary duty, trade secrets and misappropriation</p>\n<p id=\"b1196-7\">We consider first the cases reviewing copyright preemption of trade secret law. Of the four principal cases, only one has found preemption.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> In <em>Videotronics, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bend Electronics </em>(D.Nev. 1983) 564 F.Supp. 1471, 1476-1477, the court expressly held that copyright law preempted state law claims for misappropriation, trade secrets and unfair competition. Plaintiffs developed a computer video program called \u201cChallenger Wild Poker.\u201d The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1347\">*1347</page-number>defendants originally contracted with plaintiffs to distribute the product. Later, however, they began to manufacture and sell copies of plaintiffs\u2019 product without permission. Plaintiffs sued for violations of trade secret under Nevada law. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1475.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-5\">After reciting the Restatement\u2019s outline of trade secrets law, the court found that the defendants had <em>not </em>gotten the information necessary to copy the program by breaching a confidential relationship. (564 F.Supp. at pp. 1475-1476.) The court found that any owner of plaintiff\u2019s game could have decoded the game\u2019s workings. Accordingly, the court found that trade secrets law itself did not protect plaintiffs. (564 F.Supp. at p. 1476.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-6\">The court then looked to the law of misappropriation. It concluded that the copyright protection afforded plaintiffs\u2019 computer program preempted \u201crelief under the state common law doctrines of misappropriation and trade secret . . . .\u201d (564 F.Supp. at p. 1477.)<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1197-7\">Videotronics\u2019s statement about trade secret preemption is pure dicta. The court had earlier found no breach of confidential relationship under state trade secret law. Since no state trade secrets claim existed, the court should have confined itself to its misappropriation holding. Moreover, the analysis leading up to that holding lacks any discussion of how misappropriation law is equivalent to copyright. (See Bender, <em>supra, </em>47 U.Pitt.L.Rev. at p. 927.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1197-8\">Three courts have rejected claims that copyright preempts state actions based on trade secrets.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> In <em>Warrington Assoc., Inc. </em>v. <em>Real-Time Eng. Systems, Inc. </em>(N.D.I11. 1981) 522 F.Supp. 367, the plaintiff sued for wrongful appropriation and use of trade secrets from its computer programs. The court rejected the defendants\u2019 copyright preemption argument. It based its decision on a perceived lack of equivalence between copyright and trade <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1348\">*1348</page-number>secret.<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> The court also found passages in the legislative history of the 1976 revision to the Copyright Act that supported its view.<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> Finally, the court found that the courts of the states that provided the relevant trade secrets law \u201chave continued to recognize causes of action for trade secret misappropriation subsequent to the amendment of the federal Copyright Act of 1976. The common law of each of these forums stresses that the trade secrets tort is premised on concepts of breach of trust and confidentiality, and not copying. [Citations.].\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 369.)<footnotemark>29</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1198-4\">In <em>Brignoli </em>v. <em>Balch Hardy and Scheinman, Inc. </em>(S.D.N.Y. 1986) 645 F.Supp. 1201, the court considered a series of state law claims arising out of a computer program\u2019s unauthorized use. Citing the \u201cqualitatively different extra element\u201d test, the court noted that a mere \u201cclaim that a defendant made unauthorized use of copyrightable material falls squarely within \u00a7 301 and is thus preempted. [Citation.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1205.) Nevertheless, the court found sufficiently different \u201cextra elements\u201d to avoid preemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b1198-5\">The court\u2019s discussion of the second and sixth causes of action is most relevant to the case before us. Concerning the second cause of action, the court stated: \u201cAlthough that part of Brignoli\u2019s second claim which alleges \u2018willful unauthorized use of plaintiff\u2019s property\u2019 might seem to come within \u00a7 301, Brignoli\u2019s allegations that the programs are trade secrets make this claim \u2018qualitatively different\u2019 from a copyright claim.\u201d (645 F.Supp. at p. 1205.) The court then found that the sixth claim \u201calleges a breach of an agreement of confidentiality or duty of confidentiality. Such a claim is not equivalent to a copyright claim. [Citation.]\u201d <em>{Ibid.) </em>Accordingly, without more analysis, the court found that copyright preempted none of plaintiff\u2019s claims. <em>{Id. </em>at p. 1206.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1349\">*1349</page-number>In <em>M. Bryce &amp; Associates </em>v. <em>Gladstone </em>(1982) 107 Wis.2d 241 [319 N.W.2d 907], the Wisconsin Court of Appeals gave the most extensive discussion of preemption matters. For three reasons, it concluded that copyright did not preempt trade secrets law.</p>\n<p id=\"b1199-4\">First, it focused on the differences between copyright and trade secret law. Like the <em>Real-Time </em>court, it found that \u201c[t]he line of demarcation between trade secret and copyright protection is clear. Trade secret law protects content irrespective of form of expression; copyright law protects form of expression but not the underlying ideas.\u201d (319 N.W.2d at p. 915.) It noted that trade secret law bars unauthorized disclosure or use of these ideas \u201conly by persons who are privy to the trade secret by reason of some relationship to the owner which legally limits use or disclosure by them.  Copyright law prohibits unauthorized copying by anyone of the form of expression in which the ideas are fixed by the author. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at pp. 915-916.)<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b1199-5\">Second, the court also reviewed the legislative history of the 1976 and 1980 Copyright Act amendments. Although it found some confusion in the legislative history of the 1976 amendments, it concluded that \u201cthe thrust of the congressional discussion was in the direction of continued state protection.\u201d (319 N.W.2d at p. 918.)<footnotemark>31</footnotemark> It found particular solace in a portion of the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s report on the 1980 amendments. <em>{Ibid.) </em>Those amendments addressed some applications of copyright law to computer software. <em>{Ibid.) </em>The House report stated: \u201cThe Committee consulted the Copyright Office for its opinion as to whether section 301 of the 1976 Copyright Act in any way preempted [unfair competition and trade secret] and other forms of state law protection for computer software. On the basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1350\">*1350</page-number>of this advice and advice of its own counsel the Committee concluded that state remedies for protection of computer software are not limited by this bill.\u201d <em>(Ibid., </em>quoting H.R.Rep. No. 96-1307, pt. I, 96th Cong, 2d Sess. (1980) pp. 23-24.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-4\">Third, the court reviewed the evolution of the Supreme Court\u2019s view of trade secret preemption in patent law. Two unfair competition cases from 1964 suggested an expanded federal law at the expense of state remedies. (See <em>Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Stiffel Co. </em>(1964) 376 U.S. 225, 232-233 [11 L.Ed.2d 661, 667-668, 84 S.Ct. 784]; <em>Compco Corp. </em>v. <em>Day-Brite Lighting, Inc. </em>(1964) 376 U.S. 234, 237-238 [11 L.Ed.2d 669, 672-673, 84 S.Ct. 779].) In <em>Kewanee Oil Co. </em>v. <em>Bicron Corp., supra, </em>416 U.S. 470, 479-480 [40 L.Ed.2d 315, 324-325], however, the court ruled that patent law does not preempt trade secret law. <em>Bryce </em>then concluded: \u201cThe Supreme Court in <em>Kewanee </em>has recognized the value of trade secrets. No significant opposition to this aspect of the <em>Kewanee </em>decision has been shown by Congress, particularly in view of the statutory evidence that Congress did not intend to preempt trade secret law. [][] Since no \u2018unmistakable\u2019 indication has been given to the contrary by Congress and the weight of the evidence points to the recognition by Congress of the value of state protection of trade secrets, we conclude that state trade secret protection has not been preempted by the federal copyright laws.\u201d <em>(Bryce, supra, </em>319 N.W.2d at p. 919.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-5\">One factor distinguishes <em>Bryce. </em>Unlike <em>Real-Time </em>and <em>Brignoli, Bryce </em>arose under the 1906 Copyright Act. (319 N.W.2d at p. 913.) That act, however, has no express preemption clause equivalent to current section 301. (See Bender, <em>supra, </em>47 U.Pitt.L.Rev. at p. 928, fn. 73.) Thus, its discussion of the 1976 and 1980 amendments is dicta. Nevertheless, its analysis is sound. It comports with the majority view and we adopt its reasoning.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-6\">We thus conclude that copyright does not preempt state claims based upon trade secret law. We turn to those cases involving breach of confidence. We initially note that the trade secret cases themselves suggest the lack of preemption in the breach of confidence cases. As outlined above, trade secrets cases frequently involve confidential relationships. (See, e.g., <em>Bryce, supra, </em>319 N.W.2d at p. 915; Rest. 1st Torts \u00a7 757.) Nevertheless, protection of trade secrets may arise even absent a confidential relationship.<footnotemark>32</footnotemark> We thus look to the cases discussing such relationships outside of the trade secret context.</p>\n<p id=\"b1200-7\">\u201cThe law of confidential relationships governs duties of trust that one is not obligated to assume. Once a person commits himself to a confidential relationship, the law requires him to fulfill the duties attendant to the relationship. Confidential relations protects the <em>trust </em>that is implicit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1351\">*1351</page-number>in relationships between employers and employees, between masters and servants, and between principals and agents, rather than the <em>information </em>that may pass between these parties.\u201d (Note, <em>Federal Copyright Protection and State Trade Secret Protection: The Case for Partial Preemption, supra, </em>33 Am.U.L.Rev. 667, 687 [fns. omitted, italics in original].) The courts have generally found that actions for breach of a confidential relationship survive a copyright preemption challenge.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-5\">In addition to <em>Brignoli, supra, </em>645 F.Supp. at pages 1205-1206, several other courts have refused to find such claims preempted. <em>(Walker </em>v. <em>Time-Life Films, supra, </em>784 F.2d at p. 53 [while copyright preempted general \u201cunfair competition\u201d claim, no such preemption of breached confidential or fiduciary relationship claims; evidence, however, insufficient to find such latter claims]; <em>Ronald Litoff, Ltd. </em>v. <em>A. Kush &amp; Assoc., Ltd. </em>(S.D.N.Y. 1985) 621 F.Supp. 981, 986; <em>P.I.T.S. Films </em>v. <em>Laconis </em>(E.D.Mich. 1984) 588 F.Supp. 1383, <em>1386; Sargent v. American Greetings Corp. </em>(N.D.Ohio 1984) 588 F.Supp. 912, 923-924; <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Weinstein </em>(S.D.N.Y. 1984) 578 F.Supp. 1297, 1307; see also <em>Litchfield </em>v. <em>Spielberg </em>(9th Cir. 1984) 736 F.2d 1352, 1358 [state claim for misappropriation preempted but separate state claims for breach of confidential relationship dismissed without adjudication because no meritorious federal claim existed to which they could append]; <em>Mayer </em>v. <em>Josiah Wedgwood &amp; Sons, Ltd. </em>(S.D.N.Y. 1985) 601 F.Supp. 1523, 15, 36 [breach of confidential relationship possibly not preempted].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-6\">The discussion in these cases adds little to the analysis already discussed above in the trade secrets section. We see no basis for distinguishing the cases or the theory.  Accordingly, we agree that copyright does not preempt a cause of action based on breach of confidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1201-7\">We turn to the breach of fiduciary duty cases. In <em>Del Madera Properties </em>v. <em>Rhodes and Gardner, Inc. </em>(9th Cir. 1987) 820 F.2d 973, 977, the Ninth Circuit held that copyright preempted an unfair competition claim based on an alleged breach of fiduciary duty. While partners with plaintiff, the defendants had allegedly misappropriated the plaintiff\u2019s time and effort in creating certain maps and documents. The court found that the breached fiduciary duty allegation \u201cdoes not add any \u2018extra element\u2019 which changes the nature of the action. The argument is constructed upon the premise that the documents and information [one former partner] furnished to the defendants belonged to [plaintiff] and were misappropriated by the defendants. [Plaintiff\u2019s] ownership of this material, and the alleged misappropriation by the defendants, are part and parcel of the copyright claim. Thus, [plaintiff\u2019s] unfair competition claim for misappropriation of its time and effort expended in producing the . . . map and supporting documents is preempted.\u201d <em>{Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1202-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1352\">*1352</page-number>For several reasons, we distinguish <em>Del Madera. </em>First, the court cited no authority for its conclusion that copyright preempts a breach of fiduciary duty claim. In particular, the court completely ignored its earlier holding in <em>Oddo </em>v. <em>Ries </em>(9th Cir. 1984) 743 F.2d 630, 635. In that case, the court stated: \u201cOddo also claimed that Ries breached the fiduciary duty that Ries owed Oddo as a partner. Because a partner\u2019s duty to his co-partner is quite different from the interests preempted by copyright, this cause of action is also not preempted.\u201d <em>(Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1202-4\">Second, the <em>Del Madera </em>plaintiff\u2019s claim appeared to involve <em>only </em>the time and effort involved in creating the arguably copyrightable documents. Here, however, Balboa\u2019s alleged breach of fiduciary duty extends way beyond the unauthorized transfer of software enhancements. Given the broader allegations of breach, we do not find the claim preempted.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-5\">Several other courts have also concluded that a claim for breach of fiduciary duty survives copyright preemption. (See <em>Walker </em>v. <em>Time Life Films, supra, </em>784 F.2d at p. 53; <em>Ronald Litoff Ltd. </em>v. <em>A. Kush &amp; Assoc. Ltd., supra, </em>621 F.Supp. at p. 986; <em>Werlin </em>v. <em>Reader's Digest Ass'n., Inc. </em>(S.D.N.Y. 1981) 528 F.Supp. 451, 464; see also <em>Rand McNally &amp; Co. </em>v. <em>Fleet Management Systems, Inc. </em>(N.D.I11. 1983) 591 F.Supp. 726, 739 [breach of fiduciary duty claim may avoid preemption]; cf. <em>Avco Corp. </em>v. <em>Precision Air Parts, Inc, supra, </em>210 U.S.P.Q. (BNA) 894, 897-898 [trade secret claim preempted where complaint alleged no breach or trust or confidentiality].) Again, like the breach of confidentiality cases, these cases add little analytically to the \u201cextra element\u201d analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-6\">We see little basis for distinguishing the breached fiduciary duty claims from the breached confidential relationship and trade secret claims. They all generally involve the extra element of an important relationship. The damages flow from the disruption of that relationship, in whatever form it occurs. Here, the alleged disruption involved numerous points beyond the software claims. Accordingly, we conclude that the breach of fiduciary duty claim survives preemption.</p>\n<p id=\"b1202-7\">Finally, we turn to the common law misappropriation claim. This claim\u2019s vagueness has engendered various analyses. For example, in <em>Warner Bros. </em>v. <em>American Broadcasting Companies </em>(2d Cir. 1983) 720 F.2d 231, 247, the court stated unequivocally: \u201cstate law claims that rely on the misappropriation branch of unfair competition are preempted, [citations].\u201d Nimmer generally concludes that misappropriation that \u201cconsisted simply of the acts of reproduction and distribution . . . undoubtedly constitutes a right \u2018within the general scope of copyright as specified by [17 U.S.C.S.] section 106.\u2019 \u201d (1 Nimmer, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 1.01[B][1] at p. 1-20.3; see also <em>id. </em>at pp. 1-20.5 to 1-20.6 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1353\">*1353</page-number>[misappropriation by copying of musical tapes also preempted].)<footnotemark>33</footnotemark> At least one court, however, has found no preemption of misappropriation claims. (See <em>Sargent </em>v. <em>American Greetings Corp., supra, </em>588 F.Supp. at p. 924.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1203-4\">In the case before us, we conclude that Balboa has no common law misappropriation claim involving the software. Such a claim adds no extra element such as breach of fiduciary duty, breach of confidentiality or improper revelation of a trade secret.

Some factors to be considered in determining whether given information is one\u2019s trade secret are: (1) the extent to which the information is known outside of [one\u2019s] business; (2) the extent to which it is known by employees and others involved in [one\u2019s] business; (3) the extent of the measures taken by [the proprietor] to guard the secrecy of the information; (4) the value of the information to [the proprietor] and to [the proprietor\u2019s] competitors; (5) the amount of effort or money expended by [the proprietor] in developing the information; (6) the ease or difficulty with which the information could be properly acquired or duplicated by others.\u201d (Rest. 1st of Torts, \u00a7 757, com. b: see <em>Uribe </em>v. <em>Howie, supra, </em>19 Cal.App.3d at p. 208.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1195-8\">In 1984, California adopted its version of the Uniform Trade Secrets Act.

The act, however, does not apply to misappropriations that occurred before January 1, 1985. (Civ. Code, \u00a7 3426.10.)
