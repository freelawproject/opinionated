The Supreme Court vacated and remanded for further consideration in light of <em>Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 127 S.Ct. 625, 166 L.Ed.2d 462 (2006). Sandoval-Vallejo challenges the district court\u2019s increase in his term of imprisonment based on its determination that his conviction of cocaine possession constituted an aggravated felony for purposes of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C). Although Sandoval-Vallejo has been released from prison, his case is not moot, because he is serving his supervised release term and is present in the United States. <em>Cf. United States v. Rosenbaum-Alanis, </em>483 F.3d 381, 382-83 (5th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b586-27\">Under <em>Lopez, </em>the district court committed plain error. <em>See Lopez, </em>127 S.Ct. at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"565\">*565</page-number>638; <em>United States v. Villegas, </em>404 F.3d 355, 364 (5th Cir.2005). Because Sandoval-Vallejo has shown that there is a reasonable probability that he would have received a lesser sentence if not for misapplication of the guidelines, the plain error affected his substantial rights and seriously affected the fairness of the proceeding. <em>See Villegas, </em>404 F.3d at 364-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">Accordingly, the conviction is AFFIRMED, and the sentence is VACATED and REMANDED for resentencing. On remand, Sandoval may seek a modification of his term of supervised release pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(2).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b586-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
