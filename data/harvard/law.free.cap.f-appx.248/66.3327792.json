NLRB, </em>127 F.3d 1300, 1306 (11th Cir.1997) (quoting <em>NLRB v. Malta Constr. Co., </em>806 F.2d 1009, 1010 (11th Cir.1986)). If the NLRB \u201chas made a plausible inference from the record evidence, we may not overturn its findings, even if we would have made contrary findings upon a <em>de novo </em>review of the evidence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>This \u201cexceedingly narrow\u201d standard of review keeps us from disturbing the NLRB\u2019s decision \u201cunless the [NLRBJ\u2019s discretion has been exercised \u2018in an arbitrary or capricious manner.\u2019 \u201d <em>Daylight Grocery Co., Inc. v. NLRB, </em>678 F.2d 905, 908 (11th Cir.1982) (quoting <em>Spartans Indus., Inc. v. NLRB, </em>406 F.2d 1002, 1005 (5th Cir.1969)).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">CSR admits that it refused to bargain with the Union, but contests the validity of the Union\u2019s certification. CSR argues that it refused to bargain in order to get a review of the Regional Director\u2019s direction of election that was not a final order otherwise subject to judicial review. CSR contends that the Regional Director failed to properly apply and weigh community of interest factors in directing a self-determination election to determine whether the facility specialists desired to be included in the existing bargaining unit. CSR maintains that the NLRB\u2019s determination that the facility specialists should be included in the existing bargaining unit composed partly of technical and clerical employees is not supported by substantial evidence. The NLRB counters that it acted within its discretion in determining that CSR\u2019s facility specialists share a community of interest with the other employees, and therefore properly found that CSR violated 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 158(a)(5) and (1) by refusing to bargain with the Union.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">The NLRB is not required to select the most appropriate bargaining unit for employees; instead, it is \u201conly required to select a unit appropriate under the circumstances.\u201d <em>Daylight Grocery, </em>678 F.2d at 908. The record does not demonstrate that the NLRB acted arbitrarily or capriciously in concluding that the facility specialists and the technical and clerical employees constitute an appropriate bargaining unit. Thus, we conclude that there was nothing arbitrary or capricious about the NLRB ordering CSR to recognize and bargain with the Union. Accordingly, the NLRB\u2019s order is enforced.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">ORDER ENFORCED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
