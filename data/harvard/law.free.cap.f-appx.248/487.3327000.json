Dumbuya appeals only the district court\u2019s determination that he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies as required by the Prison Litigation Reform Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a) (2000) (\u201cPLRA\u201d). Even if Dumbuya could prove exhaustion of his administrative remedies under the PLRA, we affirm the entry of summary judgment for the remaining reasons stated by the magistrate judge and adopted by the district court. <em>See Dumbuya v. Riley, </em>No. 9:05-cv-03257-DCN (D.S.C. Mar. 15, 2007). We also affirm the denial of Dumbuya\u2019s discovery motions as moot. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately addressed in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b509-23\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
