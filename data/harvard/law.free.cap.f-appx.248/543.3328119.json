At sentencing, without objection, the district court ordered that Sheid serve his federal sentence consecutively to future Texas sentences that might be imposed on revocation of Sheid\u2019s probation in Palo Pinto County case No. 09355 and in Parker County case No. 10954. Sheid\u2019s appointed trial attorney did not file a direct appeal or a motion to withdraw pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-9\">Sheid argued in the district court (1) that his appointed counsel was ineffective for failing to argue at sentencing for a concurrent or partially concurrent sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(c) and (2) that counsel was ineffective for failing to appeal the consecutive sentence. The district court summarily dismissed the motion on the ground that \u00a7 5G1.3(c) did not apply to Sheid\u2019s sentence; thus, the court concluded that counsel could not have been ineffective for failing to make a frivolous objection. The court did not address Sheid\u2019s claim that appointed counsel failed to file a direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b566-14\">We granted Sheid a certificate of appealability on the issue whether the district court erred in summarily dismissing his claims that counsel was ineffective for failing to argue at sentencing for a concurrent or partially concurrent sentence and for failing to challenge the consecutive federal sentence on direct appeal. <em>United States v. Sheid, </em>No. 1105-10895 (5th Cir. Dec. 12, 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-15\">A \u00a7 2255 motion should be dismissed \u201cif it plainly appears from the motion, any attached exhibits, and the record of prior proceedings that the moving party is not entitled to relief.\u201d <em>Rule k(b), Rules Governing Section 2255 Proceedings. </em>We review for abuse of discretion the denial of an evidentiary hearing to evaluate a \u00a7 2255 movant\u2019s claims of ineffective counsel. <em>United States v. Cervantes, </em>132 F.3d 1106, 1109-10 (5th Cir.1998). A hearing is required on \u00a7 2255 review unless the \u201cmotions, files, and records of the case conclusively show that the prisoner is entitled to no relief.\u201d <em>United States v. Bartholomew, </em>974 F.2d 39, 41 (5th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b566-16\">Section 5G1.3(c) addresses whether a consecutive or concurrent sentence should be imposed in certain situations when the defendant being sentenced is subject to a prior undischarged term of imprisonment. \u00a7 5G1.3(c). The Sentencing Guidelines were amended effective November 1, 2003, to give the district court the discretion whether to impose a consecutive or concurrent sentence pursuant to \u00a7 5G1.3(c). <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"545\">*545</page-number><em>United States v. Huff </em>370 F.3d 454, 464-66 (5th Cir.2004); <em>see also United States v. Perez, </em>225 Fed.Appx. 241 (5th Cir.2007). Although Sheid was sentenced in July 2004, it is not clear from the record that the district court was aware that the recent amendments to \u00a7 5G1.3(c) made Sheid eligible for a concurrent or partially concurrent sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-5\">The district court held that summary dismissal was proper because <em>Huff </em>dictates that \u00a7 5G1.3(c) applies only \u201cwhere the defendant was on parole when the federal offense occurred <em>and </em>his parole was revoked prior to the federal sentencing.\u201d (emphasis in original). To the contrary, <em>Huff </em>does not hold that \u00a7 5G1.3(c) applies only in cases where a defendant\u2019s parole has been revoked prior to his federal sentencing. <em>See Huff, </em>370 F.3d at 463-66. Section 5G1.3(c), by its terms, applies \u201c[i]n any other case involving an undischarged term of imprisonment,\u201d not only to cases in which parole has been previously revoked. Accordingly, the district court erred in holding that \u00a7 5G1.3(c) is inapplicable because Sheid\u2019s state parole had not been revoked at the time of his federal sentencing. Furthermore, the district court\u2019s stated basis for denying \u00a7 2255 relief is inconsistent with the judgment of conviction. The district court denied \u00a7 2255 relief on the ground that, because \u00a7 5G1.3(c) did not apply to Sheid\u2019s sentence, counsel could not have been ineffective for having failed to make a frivolous objection; however, the judgment of conviction imposing the consecutive federal sentence specifically cites \u00a7 5G1.3(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b567-6\">Sheid also argues that his counsel rendered ineffective assistance by failing to appeal the consecutive sentence as requested. A failure to file a requested notice of appeal is ineffective assistance of counsel even without a showing that the appeal would have merit. <em>Roe v. Flores-Ortega, </em>528 U.S. 470, 477, 486, 120 S.Ct. 1029, 145 L.Ed.2d 985 (2000); <em>see also United States v. Tapp, </em>491 F.3d 263, 266 (5th Cir.2007)(\u201c[I]f the petitioner is able to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that he requested an appeal, prejudice will be presumed and the petitioner will be entitled to file an out-of-time appeal, regardless of whether he is able to identify any arguably meritorious grounds for appeal.\u201d). Because the record in the instant case does not conclusively show whether and when Sheid requested that his counsel file an appeal, an evidentiary hearing is necessary. <em>See Tapp, </em>491 F.3d at 266.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-8\">The summary dismissal of Sheid\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion is vacated and the case is remanded for an evidentiary hearing on the issues whether counsel was ineffective for fading to argue at sentencing for a concurrent or partially concurrent sentence pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5G1.3(c) and for failing to challenge the sentence on direct appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b567-9\">VACATED AND REMANDED FOR AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b566-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
