As to the remaining incidents, where Dar Dar\u2019s coworkers touched her buttocks, the district court concluded that they could be severe enough to have subjected her to a hostile work environment. The district court conducted a bench trial on the remaining incidents and, at the end of it, entered judgment for Associated.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-5\">Dar Dar appealed the judgment for Associated, arguing that the district court erred: (1) in granting summary judgment for Associated on her retaliation claim; (2) in granting summary judgment on her hostile work environment claim to the extent that she relied on incidents other than the buttocks touching; and (3) in granting judgment to Associated at the subsequent bench trial on the hostile work environment claim based on the buttocks touching incidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-6\">We affirmed the summary judgment for Associated on her retaliation claim and agreed with the district court that the majority of incidents alleged by Dar Dar to have created a hostile work environment were insufficient as a matter of law to support such a claim. However, we reversed the court\u2019s summary judgment as to two of the incidents found by the court to be insufficient as a matter of law to support a hostile work environment claim \u2014 the inappropriate comments made by Robert Diez and Tony Guzman \u2014 concluding that these, together with the buttocks touching incidents, raised a genuine issue of material fact as to Dar Dar\u2019s hostile work environment claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-11\">We vacated the judgment and remanded for the district court to determine whether the following alleged acts subjected Dar Dar to a hostile work environment: (1) Dar Dar being touched repeatedly on her buttocks by coworkers; (2) Robert Diez asking Dar Dar if she had seen or worn panties with a \u201cbuilt-in butt\u201d; and (3) Tony Guzman telling Dar Dar that he had seen an individual\u2019s \u201cwhale of a dick\u201d in the restroom. <em>Dar Dar v. Associated Outdoor Club, Inc., </em>201 Fed.Appx. 718 (11th Cir. 2006). On remand, the district court found without further evidentiary proceedings that these acts, taken as a whole, did not establish that Dar Dar was subjected to a hostile work environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b106-12\">Dar Dar contends that this Court erred in the first appeal by not directing the district court on remand to consider evidence of the other non-sexual incidents that we concluded in the first appeal were insufficient as a matter of law to support a hostile work environment claim and to consider Associated\u2019s alleged failure to take effective action to address Dar Dar\u2019s complaints. Because we have already ruled on these matters, however, we are bound by the law of the case to reject this contention. \u201cThe law of the case doctrine bars relitigation of issues that were decided, either explicitly or by necessary implication, in an earlier appeal of the same case.\u201d <em>United States v. Jordan, </em>429 F.3d 1032, 1035 (11th Cir.2005). Although exceptions exist, such as when \u201cwe are convinced [that] our decision in the prior appeal is clearly erroneous and following it would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"85\">*85</page-number>work a manifest injustice,\u201d none of them are present in this case. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b107-5\">Dar Dar\u2019s second contention is similar to the first, in that it essentially challenges one of our rulings in the first appeal. Dar Dar contends that we erred in affirming the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment to Associated on the retaliation claim. <em>See Dar Dar, </em>201 Fed.Appx. at 723-24. For the same reasons her first contention is barred by the law of the case doctrine, this one is also.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-6\">Dar Dar\u2019s third contention is that the district court failed to consider the \u201cbuilt-in butt\u201d and \u201cwhale of a dick\u201d comments and the touching of her buttocks under the totality of the circumstances analysis, as we directed it to do. <em>See id. </em>To the contrary, the district court explicitly considered all of the circumstances in concluding that the facts alleged by Dar Dar did not establish a hostile work environment claim under the FRCA or Title VII. For example, the court said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b107-7\">[EJven if Capitano and/or Reker\u2019s touching could be considered sexual in nature or based on Plaintiffs sex, consideration of their conduct in addition to Diaz and Guzman\u2019s comments would not change the outcome in this case, because it is clear to the Court that these incidents, <em>considered together, </em>were not so severe or pervasive that they materially altered the conditions of Plaintiffs employment.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b107-8\">(emphasis added)</p>\n<p id=\"b107-9\">Finally, Dar Dar challenges the district court\u2019s legal conclusion that she did not prove that all of the alleged sexual harassment together created a hostile work environment by a preponderance of the evidence. We review \u201cthe district court\u2019s ... analysis of law <em>de novo.\u201d Doe v. Dekalb County Sch. Dist., </em>145 F.3d 1441, 1445 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-10\">Title VII prohibits \u201chostile work environment\u201d sexual harassment. <em>See Walton v. Johnson &amp; Johnson Servs., Inc., </em>347 F.3d 1272, 1279 (11th Cir.2003). To establish a prima facie case of hostile work environment sexual harassment, a plaintiff must show that: (1) she belongs to a protected group; (2) she has been subject to unwelcome harassment; (3) the harassment was based upon her sex; (4) the harassment \u201cwas sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the terms and conditions of employment and create a discriminatorily abusive working environment\u201d; and (5) the employer is responsible for such an environment. <em>Id. </em>at 1279-80.</p>\n<p id=\"b107-11\">The Supreme Court has identified four factors to consider in determining whether harassing conduct is sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter an employee\u2019s terms or conditions of employment: (1) \u201cthe frequency of the discriminatory conduct\u201d; (2) the severity of the conduct; (3) whether the conduct \u201cis physically threatening or humiliating, or a mere offensive utterance\u201d; and (4) whether the conduct \u201cunreasonably interferes with an employee\u2019s work performance.\u201d <em>Harris v. Forklift Sys., Inc., </em>510 U.S. 17, 23, 114 S.Ct. 367, 371, 126 L.Ed.2d 295, (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b107-12\">There were two sexually inappropriate comments and two incidents of intentional buttocks touching over the course of 22 months. In <em>Gupta v. Fla. Bd. of Regents, </em>over the course of six or seven months, the male supervisor of a female professor repeatedly called her at her home, once complimented her appearance, twice stared at her, once placed his hand on her knee, once touched the hem of her dress, once touched her ring and bracelet, and repeatedly asked her out to lunch. 212 F.3d 571, 585 (11th Cir.2000). The Court held that the supervisor\u2019s conduct, while perhaps \u201cannoying or inappropriate,\u201d was not sufficiently serious to support a sexual <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"86\">*86</page-number>harassment claim. <em>Id. </em>The two instances of employees touching Dar Dar\u2019s buttocks \u2014 in one of which the toucher was a woman in her seventies \u2014 and the two risque comments are no more serious than the conduct we held did not establish a hostile work environment in <em>Gupta. </em>As the Supreme Court has stated, \u201csimple teasing, offhand comments, and isolated incidents (unless extremely serious) will not amount to discriminatory changes in the terms and conditions of employment.\u201d <em>Faragher v. City of Boca Raton, </em>524 U.S. 775, 788, 118 S.Ct. 2275, 2283, 141 L.Ed.2d 662 (1998) (citation omitted). The district court did not err in finding that Dar Dar failed to prove that the alleged sexual harassment created a hostile work environment.</p>\n<p id=\"b108-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b105-14\">. The FCRA is patterned after Title VII, and thus federal case law dealing with Title VII is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"84\">*84</page-number>applicable to employment discrimination claims brought under Florida law. <em>Maniccia </em>v. <em>Brown, </em>171 F.3d 1364, 1368 n. 2 (11th Cir.1999). Therefore, Dar Dar\u2019s FCRA claim will analyzed together with the Title VII claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
