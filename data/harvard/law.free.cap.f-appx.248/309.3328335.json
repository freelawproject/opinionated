We will dismiss this appeal in part for lack of jurisdiction and in part pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b332-18\">In his complaint, Tinsley sought damages and declaratory and injunctive relief against Philadelphia Common Pleas Court Judge Gregory Smith, Judge William Mazzola, Philadelphia District Attorney Lynne Abraham, Assistant District Attorney Diana Anholt, and Warden Adams of the Philadelphia Industrial Correctional Center. Tinsley claimed constitutional violations related to his ongoing criminal case, including violations of his rights to a speedy trial and access to the courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-19\">The District Court dismissed Tinsley\u2019s claims for equitable relief under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A. The District Court explained that Tinsley\u2019s case was ongoing in the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas, and that it would not interfere in the state judicial process where Tinsley had not shown irreparable injury, a flagrant and patent violation of an express constitutional prohibition, or other extraordinary circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-20\">The District Court also dismissed Tinsley\u2019s claims for damages against Judges Smith and Mazzola, District Attorney Abraham, and Assistant District Attorney Anholt based on absolute immunity. And the District Court denied Tinsley\u2019s request for class certification because the complaint centered on Tinsley\u2019s criminal case. Finally, the District Court ruled that Tinsley\u2019s claim against Warden Adams based on an alleged denial of library and legal mail privileges could proceed. Tinsley unsuccessfully sought reconsideration of the District Court\u2019s order, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-21\">We have jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district courts. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. The rule of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>finality requires that the judgment be final as to all parties and causes of action to be appealable. <em>Mellon Bank, N.A. v. Metro Communications, Inc., </em>945 F.2d 635, 640 (3d Cir.1991) (citing <em>Andrews v. United States, </em>373 U.S. 334, 340, 83 S.Ct. 1236, 10 L.Ed.2d 383 (1963)). Tinsley seeks to appeal an order dismissing some, but not all, of the defendants in his case. Because a final order has not been entered as to all parties, and the District Court has not certified its order under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(b), we lack jurisdiction to review the dismissal of Tinsley\u2019s claims for damages against the judges and prosecutors. And, to the extent Tinsley seeks our permission under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(f) to appeal the denial of class certification, we decline to exercise our discretionary jurisdiction. <em>See Newton v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., </em>259 F.3d 154, 163-64 (3d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">We have jurisdiction, however, of appeals from interlocutory orders \u201cgranting, continuing, modifying, refusing or dissolving injunctions, or refusing to dissolve or modify injunctions____\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1). In order to be appealable under \u00a7 1292(a)(1), the order must relate to the relief ultimately sought by the claimant. <em>Hershey Foods Corp. v. Hershey Creamery Co., </em>945 F.2d 1272, 1277-78 (3d Cir.1991). In his complaint, Tinsley sought a preliminary and permanent injunction ordering the defendants to stop denying him his rights to a speedy trial, access to the courts, and assistance of counsel. As noted above, the District Court' dismissed Tinsley\u2019s claims for special or equitable relief based on the ongoing state court proceedings. The District Court\u2019s order relates to the relief Tinsley ultimately sought in his complaint, and the order is appealable under \u00a7 1292(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-8\">Although appealable, we agree with the District Court\u2019s dismissal of Tinsley\u2019s claims for injunctive relief. Tinsley sought federal interference in an ongoing state criminal prosecution. Absent extraordinary circumstances, where the danger of irreparable loss is both great and immediate, injunctive relief is not available. <em>Younger v. Harris, </em>401 U.S. 37, 45-46, 91 S.Ct. 746, 27 L.Ed.2d 669 (1971). Tinsley has not shown that such circumstances are present here.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">Accordingly, we will dismiss Tinsley\u2019s appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction to the extent he appeals from the order dismissing his damages claims and denying class certification. We will dismiss the appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B) to the extent Tinsley appeals from the order dismissing his claims for injunctive relief and the order denying reconsideration of that order.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
