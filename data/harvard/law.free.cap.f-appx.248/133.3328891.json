On appeal, Rabb argues that the district court incorrectly classified his 1995 conviction for discharging a firearm into a dwelling as a crime of violence, for the purposes of the career offender provision of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1. Rabb bases this argument on the statute defining his offense, \u00a7 13A-ll-61(a) of the Alabama Code, and its distinction between discharges in occupied dwellings and discharges in unoccupied dwellings, for sentencing purposes. We review the preliminary determination that a prior conviction qualifies as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d <em>de novo. United States v. Ortiz-Delgado, </em>451 F.3d 752, 754 (11th Cir.2006). After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b156-14\">A defendant is classified as a career offender if the defendant was at least 18 years of age at the time of the commission of the instant offense, the instant offense was a crime of violence or a controlled substance offense, and the defendant has at least two prior convictions for crimes of violence or controlled substance offenses. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a). Section 4B1.2, in turn, defines the term \u201ccrime of violence\u201d as including, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cany offense punishable by a term of imprisonment exceeding one year that ... is burglary of a dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.2(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b156-15\">In <em>United States v. McGill, </em>450 F.3d 1276, 1280 (11th Cir.2006), we observed that the definition of conduct that presents \u201ca serious potential risk of physical injury to another,\u201d within the meaning of \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2), is broadly interpreted \u201cto include crimes that do not fit neatly into a category of hostile, aggressive acts.\u201d We noted that \u201cthe specific language of \u00a7 4B 1.2(a)(2) concerns the potential <em>risk </em>of physical injury rather than the actual <em>use </em>of force against another ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1281. In determining whether a felony is a crime of violence, for purposes of \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2), we need consider only whether the conduct proscribed creates a substantial risk of physical injury to another. <em>Id. </em>at 1282. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"135\">*135</page-number>We need not find a high probability of harm to another person, but rather a mere <em>possibility </em>that harm to another person could occur is enough under the Guideline. <em>United States v. Searcy, </em>418 F.3d 1193, 1197 (11th Cir.2005), <em>cert. denied, </em>546 U.S. 1125, 126 S.Ct. 1107, 163 L.Ed.2d 918 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b157-5\">The Alabama statute under which Rabb was convicted provides that \u201c[n]o person shall shoot or discharge a firearm, explosive or other weapon which discharges a dangerous projectile into any <em>occupied or unoccupied </em>dwelling or building or railroad locomotive or railroad car, aircraft, automobile, truck or watercraft in this state.\u201d Ala.Code \u00a7 13A-ll-61(a) (emphasis added). The statute makes <em>no </em>distinction between occupied and unoccupied dwellings, for purposes of defining the crime. Although the statute goes on to make the discharge into an occupied dwelling a Class B felony, while the same act into an unoccupied dwelling is a Class C felony, the distinction is made for sentencing purposes only. <em>See </em>Ala.Code \u00a7 13A-11-61. Thus, a defendant commits the offense proscribed by \u00a7 13A-11-61, whether the dwelling is occupied or not, and the proscribed offense is a crime of violence, within the meaning of U.S.S.G \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(2), because there is a potential <em>risk </em>of physical injury, which is the only showing our caselaw requires. We are unpersuaded by any of Rabb\u2019s other arguments. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b157-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
