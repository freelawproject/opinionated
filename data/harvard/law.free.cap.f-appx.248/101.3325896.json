L. No. 104-132,110 Stat. 1214 (1996). For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-13\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b124-14\">Bell is currently incarcerated pursuant to his December 20, 2000 conviction on two counts of aggravated battery. He appealed his convictions and sentences to the Fifth District Court of Appeal of the State of Florida, which affirmed in an opinion filed on February 5, 2002, 806 So.2d 600. Bell later filed motions for post-conviction relief in state court on September 3, 2002, January 20, 2004, and January 12, 2005.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-15\">On March 19, 2006, Bell signed and mailed his first <em>pro se </em>\u00a7 2254 habeas petition. In an order dated April 27, 2006, the federal district court ordered Bell to re-file his \u00a7 2254 petition on an approved form within eleven days. Bell completed his petition on the approved form, and he signed and mailed the petition on May 7, 2006. In an order dated May 16, 2006, the district court again ordered Bell to re-file the petition because his first re-filed petition exceeded the allowable page length and did not comply with formatting requirements. Bell signed and mailed his corrected petition on May 25, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b124-16\">In his second re-filed petition, Bell acknowledged that the petition was untimely, but he asserted that newly discovered evidence, inadequate access to the prison law library, and a lack of knowledge of the AEDPA limitations period (resulting from his inability to access the law library) were extraordinary circumstances that justified equitable tolling. Specifically, Bell stated that he was housed at the Polk County Work Camp, which does not have a law library, and officials at the camp denied him access to the \u201cmain prison\u201d library, located across the street. Because he had no access to \u201clegal materials,\u201d Bell contended that he had no \u201cknowledge of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"103\">*103</page-number>AEDPA regarding time limitations.\u201d Bell also noted that he had attached to his initial \u00a7 2254 petition, as \u201cExhibit A,\u201d his November 15, 2005 request for access to the law library, which prison officials had denied because he failed to \u201cprove\u201d that he had a \u201c20 or fewer calendar day deadline imposed on [him] by court order or rule of court.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b125-5\">The district court dismissed Bell\u2019s \u00a7 2254 petition as time-barred. Finding that Bell had not shown sufficiently \u201cextraordinary circumstances beyond his control,\u201d the court rejected Bell\u2019s claim to equitable tolling. The court also rejected Bells\u2019s argument regarding \u201cnewly discovered evidence\u201d on the ground that Bell had not specified the nature of the newly discovered evidence or when he became aware of that evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-6\">Bell filed a notice of appeal and moved for a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d), reiterating his argument that he was entitled to equitable tolling. Specifically, Bell argued that he was housed at the Polk County Work Camp, which does not have a law library, and officials at the work camp denied him access to the \u201cMain Unit\u201d library, located across the street, unless he could \u201cshow a 20 day deadline.\u201d He stated that after his request for access to the Main Unit library was denied, he sought help from \u201cPolk Work Camp Prison Officials\u201d and was told to submit an inmate request to the Main Unit library, which he had already done.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> This court granted a COA on the limited issue of whether Bell was entitled to equitable tolling based on his contention that he was unaware of the limitations period because he was denied access to the prison law library.</p>\n<p id=\"b125-10\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b125-11\">On appeal, Bell argues that the district court erred in concluding that he was not entitled to equitable tolling.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s decision to deny equitable tolling. <em>Drew v. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>297 F.3d 1278, 1283 (11th Cir.2002). But the district court\u2019s determination of relevant facts \u2014 including a determination about a party\u2019s diligence \u2014 is reviewed for clear error. <em>Id. </em>Under the clear error standard, we must \u201caffirm a district court\u2019s findings of fact unless the record lacks substantial evidence to support that determination.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b125-12\">The AEDPA imposes a one-year statute of limitations for filing a \u00a7 2254 habeas petition, which begins to run following, <em>inter alia, </em>the date on which the petitioner\u2019s judgment of conviction becomes final. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1). The judgment becomes \u201cfinal\u201d on the date on which the U.S. Supreme Court issues a decision on the merits of the petitioner\u2019s direct appeal, denies a petition for writ of certiorari, or after the expiration of the 90 days in which the petitioner could have filed such a petition. <em>Bond v. Moore, </em>309 F.3d 770, 773 (11th Cir.2002). But \u201c[t]he time during which a properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim is pending shall not be counted toward any period of limitation....\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>\u201cEquitable tolling can be applied to prevent the application of AEDPA\u2019s statutory deadline when \u2018extraordinary circumstances\u2019 have worked to prevent an otherwise diligent petitioner from timely filing his petition.\u201d <em>Helton v. Sec\u2019y for Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>259 F.3d 1310, 1312 (11th Cir.2001). \u201cA determination as to whether rare and exceptional circumstances are presented requires the examination of the facts in each case,\u201d <em>Arthur v. Allen, </em>452 F.3d 1234, 1253 (11th Cir.2006), and \u201c[t]he burden of establishing entitlement to this extraordinary remedy plainly rests with the petitioner,\u201d <em>Wade v. Battle, </em>379 F.3d 1254, 1265 (11th Cir.2004) (citations omitted). Even if a prisoner shows that \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d occurred, the prisoner must still demonstrate that he acted with due diligence in order to be entitled to equitable tolling. <em>See Helton, </em>259 F.3d at 1313. If a petitioner cannot establish due diligence, we need not consider whether extraordinary circumstances existed. <em>Diaz v. Sec\u2019y for Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>362 F.3d 698, 702 n. 7 (11th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b126-4\">Here, Bell\u2019s limitations period began to run on May 6, 2002 \u2014 after the expiration of the 90 days in which Bell could have petitioned the Supreme Court for writ of certiorari. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(1); <em>Chavers v. Sec\u2019y, Fla. Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>468 F.3d 1273, 1275 (11th Cir.2006) (holding that entry of judgment, and not the issuance of a mandate, starts the clock running for time to petition the Supreme Court for certiorari). Thereafter, beginning on September 3, 2002, Bell filed several motions for post-conviction relief in state court, and the limitations period was tolled by statute during the pendency of these proceedings. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(d)(2). But on December 8, 2004, the one-year limitations period expired.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Because Bell did not file his \u00a7 2254 petition until March 19, 2006, absent equitable tolling, his petition is time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-7\">Bell argues that he was unaware of AEDPA\u2019s one-year limitations period because despite his due diligence, he was denied access to the law library housed at the Main Unit of his prison. According to Bell, his inability to access the law library was an extraordinary circumstance beyond his control, justifying equitable tolling of the limitations period. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b126-8\">The record shows that Bell did not formally request access to the' prison law library until November 15, 2005 \u2014 more than eleven months <em>after </em>the limitations period had expired on December 8, 2004. And there is no record evidence that <em>before </em>the limitations period expired, Bell diligently attempted to determine the applicable limitations period (by, for example, attempting to access the prison law library) or that prison officials thwarted his efforts. Moreover, Bell filed three <em>pro se </em>motions for post-conviction relief in state court during the relevant time period, and there is no evidence that Bell\u2019s access to the law library was so inadequate as to prevent him from researching the legal issues raised in those motions. <em>See Akins v. United States, </em>204 F.3d 1086, 1089 (11th Cir.2000) (rejecting a claim of equitable tolling where petitioner claimed that two prison lockdowns prevented him from using the prison library for a six-month period, because even absent the six-month period of inaccessibility, the petitioner still had four years to prepare and file his habeas motion, and he had access to the library during these four years). As such, Bell has failed to establish that his inability to access the prison law library was an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"105\">*105</page-number>extraordinary circumstance that prevented him from timely filing his \u00a7 2254 petition despite his due diligence. We therefore conclude that the district court did not err in dismissing Bell\u2019s petition as time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b127-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b127-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b125-7\">. There appears to be nothing in the record documenting when Bell was housed in the prison's \"Main Unit\u201d and when he was moved to the prison\u2019s Work Camp.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b125-8\">. In his appellate brief, Bell also raises nine substantive arguments regarding the merits of his \u00a7 2254 petition. Because these issues are outside of the narrow scope of the COA, we do not address them. <em>See Murray v. United States, </em>145 F.3d 1249, 1250-51 (11th Cir.1998).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b126-5\">. The limitations period ran for 120 days from May 6, 2002 to September 3, 2002; 22 days from December 29, 2003 to January 20, 2004; and for 222 days from April 30, 2004 to December 8, 2004.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
