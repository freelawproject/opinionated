The District Court dismissed the action for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. The District Court also dismissed Salkeld\u2019s motion to restrain SCI-Rockview from opening \u201cprivileged\u201d mail concerning legal issues because Salkeld had failed to file a brief in support of his motion as required by a local rule. Salkeld filed an appeal.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Because no substantial question is presented, L.A.R. 27.4, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">We need not repeat the details of Salkeld\u2019s claims here as they are well-known to the parties and are summarized in the District Court\u2019s memorandum. In brief, Salkeld contends his constitutional right of access to the courts was violated when the prison did not advance him sufficient funds to mail a state court filing in a timely fashion. Salkeld contends that because defendants\u2019 actions prevented him from timely filing a statement of issues complained of on appeal in the Pennsylvania Superior Court, all of his appellate issues were waived. Salkeld further contends that the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections\u2019 inmate mail policy (policy number DC-ADM 803) is unconstitutional because it does not provide for the advancement of funds to non-indigent inmates for legal mail.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-10\">We agree that the District Court properly dismissed Salkeld\u2019s claims, but for different reasons. <em>See Erie Telecomms. v. Erie, </em>853 F.2d 1084, 1089 &amp; n. 10 (3d Cir.1988) (an appellate court may affirm a correct decision by a lower court on grounds different than those used by the lower court in reaching its decision). An inmate alleging a violation of <em>Bounds v. Smith, </em>430 U.S. 817, 97 S.Ct. 1491, 52 L.Ed.2d 72 (1977), must show an actual injury, a requirement that derives from the doctrine of standing. <em>Lewis v. Casey, </em>518 U.S. 343, 349, 116 S.Ct. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996). Specifically, the inmate must show that the alleged shortcomings in the prison policy \u201chindered his efforts to pursue a legal claim.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 351, 116 S.Ct. 2174. <em>See also Reynolds v. Wagner, </em>128 F.3d 166, 183 (3d Cir.1997) (no First Amendment right to subsidized mail). However, the injury requirement is not satisfied by just any type of frustrated legal claim; the legal claim must relate to a direct or collateral challenge to a prisoner\u2019s sentence or conditions of confinement. <em>Lewis, </em>518 U.S. at 349, 116 S.Ct. 2174 (\u201cImpairment of any <em>other </em>litigating capacity is simply one of the incidental (and perfectly constitutional) consequences of conviction and incarceration.\u201d) (emphasis in original). Here, Salkeld alleged only that he was unable to timely file a statement of matters appealed from in a \u201ccivil matter\u201d pending in Pennsylvania state court. Further, the state court docket attached to Salkeld\u2019s amended complaint shows that he was a defendant in that civil <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>litigation. Accordingly, the District Court properly dismissed Salkeld\u2019s amended complaint. We also find no error in the District Court\u2019s decision deeming Salkeld\u2019s motion for a temporary restraining order withdrawn because of Salkeld\u2019s failure to comply with a local rule requiring the timely filing of a supporting legal brief.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-5\">For the foregoing reasons, no substantial question is presented and we will affirm the order of the District Court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b364-8\">. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. The parties were previously advised that this appeal was listed for possible dismissal as untimely. However, Salkeld filed a motion under Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(6) which was granted by the District Court. Accordingly, the instant appeal is properly before us.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
