Smoot was treated for a fractured skull, persistent headaches, and psychological injuries. He filed for benefits under the Longshore and Harbor Worker\u2019s Compensation Act, 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 901, <em>et seq. </em>(the \u201cAct\u201d). The Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) awarded Smoot temporary total disability from January 4, 2004 through May 25, 2005 and ongoing temporary partial disability thereafter based on Smoot\u2019s ongoing psychological problems resulting from his injuries. The ALJ also ordered Smoot\u2019s employer, Nabors Offshore Corporation (\u201cNabors\u201d), to pay an additional 10 percent on unpaid installments of compensation pursuant to 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 914(e) and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"575\">*575</page-number>to pay for all reasonable and necessary future medical expenses arising from Smoot\u2019s employment-related psychological injuries. Finally, the ALJ awarded attorney\u2019s fees and expenses. The Benefits Review Board (\u201cBRB\u201d) affirmed this award. Nabors appeals claiming that insufficient evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s award of disability payments. Nabors also challenges (1) the finding that Smoot is entitled to all reasonable and necessary future medical expenses resulting from his psychological injuries; (2) the award of penalties pursuant to 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 914(e); and (3) the award of attorney\u2019s fees and expenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-5\">This Court reviews decisions of the BRB under the same standard the BRB uses to review the ALJ: whether the decision is supported by substantial evidence and is in accordance with the law. <em>SGS Control Servs. v. Dir. Office of Worker\u2019s Comp. Programs, </em>86 F.3d 438, 440 (5th Cir.1996). This court may not substitute its judgment for that of the ALJ or re-weigh evidence; its review is limited to determining \u201cwhether evidence exists to support the ALJ\u2019s findings.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b597-6\">There is a presumption that a claim comes within the provisions of the Act in the absence of substantial evidence to the contrary. 33 U.S.C. \u00a7 920(a); <em>Port Cooper/T. Smith Stevedoring Co. v. Hunter, </em>227 F.3d 285, 287 (5th Cir.2000). To trigger this presumption, the plaintiff must make a prima facie showing of causation. <em>Port Cooper, </em>227 F.3d at 287. A plaintiff meets this burden by proving \u201c(1) that he or she suffered harm, and (2) that ... an accident occurred at work, that could have caused, aggravated, or accelerated the condition.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The record in this case supports the ALJ\u2019s determination that the presumption was triggered, thus shifting the burden to Nabors to rebut this presumption. <em>Id. </em>at 288. The record also supports the ALJ\u2019s finding that Nabors did not rebut the presumption that Smoot\u2019s ongoing psychological problems were causally related to his workplace accident. Also, three separate medical experts opined that Smoot\u2019s psychological condition precludes his return to work, providing ample support for the ALJ\u2019s finding that Smoot was totally disabled through May 25, 2005 and partially disabled thereafter. Although there was conflicting medical testimony in this regard, it is not the role of this court to re-weigh the evidence or make credibility determinations. <em>Mijangos v. Avondale Shipyards, </em>948 F.2d 941, 945 (5th Cir.1991). Moreover, if \u201cthe testimony of medical experts is at issue, the ALJ is entitled to accept any part of an expert\u2019s testimony or reject it completely.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. Marine Pers. Co., </em>46 F.3d 498, 500 (5th Cir.1995). The record in this case also supports the ALJ\u2019s award of future medical benefits for his psychological condition. Finally, with respect to the Section 14(e) penalty assessment and the award of attorney\u2019s fees and expenses, Nabors\u2019 sole argument is that these portions of the ALJ\u2019s award are erroneous because Smoot is not disabled and is not entitled to medical benefits. Because we affirm the finding that Smoot was totally disabled through May 25, 2005 and partially disabled thereafter, these arguments lack merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b597-8\">The order of the Benefits Review Board is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b596-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
