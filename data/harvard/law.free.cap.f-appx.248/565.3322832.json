Lin argues that the BIA erred in finding that he is not eligible for asylum based on this court\u2019s decision in <em>Zhang v. Ashcroft, </em>395 F.3d 531, 532 (5th Cir.2004). Lin argues that unlike <em>Zhang, </em>he has established that he was arrested, detained, and beaten because he refused to tell family planning officials where his pregnant girlfriend was hiding so that they could force her to have an abortion. He contends that his conduct constituted \u201cother resistance\u201d to a coercive population control policy, thereby making him eligible for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-4\">Lin must show that he suffered \u201cpersecution\u201d to obtain relief. <em>See Chen v. Ashcroft, </em>381 F.3d 221, 233 (3d Cir.2004). Lin has not shown that the evidence he presented is so compelling that no reasonable factfinder could fail to find past persecution. <em>See Jukic v. I.N.S., </em>40 F.3d 747, 749 (5th Cir.1994); <em>see also Chen, </em>381 F.3d at 234-35 (past persecution does not cover a forced abortion of petitioner\u2019s girlfriend, the denial of a marriage license, and beatings that did not result in any injuries that required medical treatment,); <em>Nelson v. I.N.S., </em>232 F.3d 258, 264 (1st Cir.2000) (three episodes of solitary confinement of less than 72 hours each and physical abuse not requiring medical attention were not \u201cpast persecution\u201d); <em>Prasad v. I.N.S., </em>47 F.3d 336, 339-40 (9th Cir.1995) (when petitioner was arrested and detained four to six hours, hit on the stomach, and kicked from behind, and no medical treatment was required, this was not past persecution); <em>Kapcia v. I.N.S., </em>944 F.2d 702, 704-08 (10th Cir.1991) (persecution not found where one applicant was \u201carrested four times, detained three times, and beaten once,\u201d and another was detained twice, once for a two-day period where he was interrogated and beaten). Although in <em>Ma v. Ashcroft </em>the Ninth Circuit held that a man could seek asylum for fear of being persecuted for the pregnancy of his girlfriend, in that case the couple had married in a traditional Chinese ceremony despite the Government\u2019s refusal to recognize their marriage due to their young age. 361 F.3d 553, 555, 561 (9th Cir.2004). We have denied asylum to individuals who did not attempt to marry the woman who has, due to pregnancy, caused petitioner to fear persecution from the Chinese government. <em>Zhang, </em>395 F.3d at 532. Lin has not shown that he attempted to marry his girlfriend in a traditional or official ceremony.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">Lin does not brief the issue of withholding of deportation, nor does he brief the issue of relief under the CAT. By failing to brief these issues, Lin has waived or abandoned them. <em>Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003); <em>Calderon-Ontiveros v. I.N.S., </em>809 F.2d 1050, 1052 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-9\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b587-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
