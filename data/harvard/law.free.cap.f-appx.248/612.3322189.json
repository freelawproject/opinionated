The clerk of this court consolidated the Hasnains\u2019 petitions for review. The Hasnains have abandoned their challenge to the denial of the motion to reopen by failing to brief any issues relevant to that denial. <em>See In re Mun. Bond Reporting Antitrust Litig., </em>672 F.2d 436, 439 n. 6 (5th Cir.1982).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">The Hasnains move for this court to remand their case to the BIA for consideration of the approval of Nizar\u2019s 1-140 visa petition on May 2, 2007. We \u201cmay not order the taking of additional evidence,\u201d 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(1), and our review is limited to the administrative record. \u00a7 1252(b)(4)(A). The Hasnains\u2019 motion for remand therefore is denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">The Hasnains contend that the BIA erred by overturning the Immigration Judge\u2019s (IJ) determination that the notices to appear (NTAs) in their case were fatally defective because they were not signed by the proper immigration authority. The NTAs were consistent with 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 239.1(a), which governs who may issue an NTA. <em>See Ali v. Gonzales, </em>435 F.3d 544, 546-47 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-7\">The Hasnains contend that the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System (NSEERS) violates the equal protection principles incorporated into the Due Process Clause. The effect of NSEERS on removal proceedings does not violate equal protection principles. <em>Ahmed v. Gonzales, </em>447 F.3d 433, 440 (5th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b635-8\">The Hasnains contend that the denial of their request for a continuance based on Nizar\u2019s labor certification was an abuse of discretion. Their contention is unavailing. We review the denial of a motion for a continuance for an abuse of discretion. <em>See Ahmed, </em>447 F.3d at 439. It is not an abuse of discretion to deny a continuance when the alien has obtained a labor certification but has not shown that an immigrant visa is immediately available. <em>Id. </em>at 438. The Hasnains submitted the Department of Labor\u2019s December 23, 2005, labor certification and Nizar\u2019s January 23, 2006,1-140 petition as evidence before the BIA. The 1-140 indicated that Nizar did not file an 1 \u2014 485 petition simultaneously with the 1-140 petition, and, although the Hasnains alleged that immigrant visas were available for all employment-based classes, they did not present any evidence, or point to any regulatory provisions, indicating that this is so. Nizar\u2019s quest for adjustment of status had not progressed sufficiently to render the denial of the Hasnains\u2019 motion for a continuance an abuse of discretion. <em>See Ahmed, </em>447 F.3d at 438.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-11\">PETITIONS FOR REVIEW DENIED; MOTION FOR REMAND DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b634-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
