We affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-24\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b148-25\">On July 3, 2005, Kettleman, driving her brother\u2019s Honda Accord with permission, caused an automobile accident that injured Mr. Soulier and caused Mrs. Soulier\u2019s death. Mr. Soulier sought to recover damages from Kettleman on his own behalf for the injuries he suffered, and on behalf of his deceased wife\u2019s estate. Kettleman\u2019s brother, Dennis Cirone, held an automo<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>bile insurance policy for the Accord from Liberty Mutual Insurance Company (\u201cLiberty Mutual\u201d). Additionally, Cirone and his wife held an excess insurance policy from Fireman\u2019s Fund.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">The Fireman\u2019s Fund policy expressly provided for coverage of automobile accidents involving an automobile covered both under the Fireman\u2019s Fund policy and under \u201ca personal automobile policy that qualifies as required underlying insurance.\u201d Here, the Liberty Mutual policy was the Cirones\u2019 required underlying insurance. Fireman\u2019s Fund advised Kettle-man, however, that it would neither cover nor defend her under its policy. Fireman\u2019s Fund then filed a declaratory judgment action, naming Kettleman and Soulier as defendants, and all three parties moved for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">The Fireman\u2019s Fund policy declares that it will \u201cfollow form\u201d of the required underlying insurance. According to the Fireman\u2019s Fund policy, \u201cfollow form\u201d means that Fireman\u2019s Fund \u201cwill use the definitions, coverages, exclusions, conditions, and other provisions of applicable required underlying insurance ... to determine coverage under this policy.\u201d The parties agree that Kettleman was an \u201cinsured\u201d under the Liberty Mutual policy. The issue in the district court was whether the \u201cfollow form\u201d provision in the Fireman\u2019s Fund policy required the use of the definition of \u201cinsured\u201d in the Liberty Mutual policy or that in the Fireman\u2019s Fund policy. The district court ruled that the Fireman\u2019s Fund policy language unambiguously required that Fireman\u2019s Fund use the definition of \u201cinsured\u201d provided in the Liberty Mutual policy. Consequently, the court denied Fireman\u2019s Fund\u2019s motion for summary judgment, granted the motions of Kettleman and Soulier, and entered a final judgment pursuant to those orders.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">We review a grant or denial of summary judgment <em>de novo. Holloman v. Mail-Well Corp., </em>443 F.3d 832, 836 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cSummary judgment is appropriate when no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d <em>Elan Pharm. Research Corp. v. Employers Ins. of Wausau, </em>144 F.3d 1372, 1375 (11th Cir.1998) (citing Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)).</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">The parties disagree as to the proper interpretation of the Fireman\u2019s Fund policy. Kettleman and Soulier argue that the \u201cfollow form\u201d provision in the Fireman\u2019s Fund policy requires that Fireman\u2019s Fund provide coverage for the accident because Kettleman was an \u201cinsured\u201d under the Liberty Mutual policy. Fireman\u2019s Fund argues that the \u201cfollow form\u201d provision in its policy did not extend to the definition of \u201cinsured.\u201d Instead, it argues, Kettleman, as a claimant under the Fireman\u2019s Fund policy, had to satisfy the definition of \u201cinsured\u201d under that policy as a threshold matter before coverage under the policy could be triggered. The district court held that the unambiguous policy language supported the view of Kettleman and Soulier. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-11\">The parties agree that New Jersey law applies to their dispute. The district court properly recognized that it must resolve insurance contract disputes according to the language of the policy. If the express language of a policy is unambiguous, the \u201ccourt is bound to enforce the policy as written.\u201d <em>Royal Ins. Co. v. Rutgers Cas. Ins. Co., </em>271 N.J.Super. 409, 638 A.2d 924, 927 (N.J.Super.Ct.App.Div.1994). Moreover, under a \u201cfollow form\u201d policy provision, \u201cthe parties agree that the coverage issues presented turn solely on the interpretation of the underlying policfy].\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number><em>Houbigant, Inc. v. Fed. Ins. Co., </em>374 F.3d 192, 203 (3d Cir.2004) (applying New Jersey law) (quoting <em>Piper Jaffray Co., Inc. v. Nat\u2019l Union Fire Ins. Co., </em>967 F.Supp. 1148, 1151 (D.Minn.1997)).</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">When, as here, an accident occurs involving an automobile covered by both a required underlying automobile insurance policy and the Fireman\u2019s Fund policy, the unambiguous language of the Fireman\u2019s Fund policy requires that the definition of \u201cinsured\u201d in the underlying policy apply. The Fireman\u2019s Fund policy expressly states that, in following form, it will \u201cuse the definitions\u201d of an underlying policy in such a case. Nowhere in its policy does Fireman\u2019s Fund exclude the definition of \u201cinsured\u201d from its \u201cfollow form\u201d requirements. Thus, the Fireman\u2019s Fund policy required that Fireman\u2019s Fund determine coverage under the policy here using the Liberty Mutual policy\u2019s definition of \u201cinsured.\u201d Because Kettleman was an \u201cinsured\u201d under the Liberty Mutual policy\u2019s definition, Fireman\u2019s Fund was bound under its policy to cover Kettleman.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b150-6\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of Kettleman and Soulier and its denial of Fireman\u2019s Fund\u2019s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
