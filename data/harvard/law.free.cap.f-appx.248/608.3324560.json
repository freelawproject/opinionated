The Government seeks enforcement of the sentence-appeal waiver in the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-20\">Vela argues that the sentence-appeal waiver should not be enforced because her conviction should be reversed, her guilty plea was not knowing and voluntary, the Government breached the agreement, she was denied effective assistance of counsel, and an exception to the waiver applies. <em>United States v. Gonzalez-Lopez, </em>548 U.S. 140, 126 S.Ct. 2557, 2565, 165 L.Ed.2d 409 (2006), is inapplicable to Vela who was represented in the district court by court-appointed counsel. Moreover, the record shows that Vela was not denied her choice of counsel and was not coerced into pleading guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-21\">Vela contends that her guilty plea was not knowing and voluntary due to prosecutorial bad faith or misconduct. Her assertions are not supported by the record. She has not briefed her argument adequately and has not shown that the district court\u2019s actions affected the validity of her guilty plea. <em>United States v. Valdiosera-Godinez, </em>932 F.2d 1093, 1099 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"610\">*610</page-number>Vela also argues that she did not have sufficient notice at rearraignment that she faced an adjustment for use of a juvenile. This assertion is belied by the record. Whether Vela \u201cresisted admitting\u201d and whether the facts at rearraignment supported the U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.4 increase are irrelevant to the validity of her guilty plea. The \u00a7 3B1.4 increase was a sentencing issue. Even <em>post-Booker</em><footnotemark><em>1</em></footnotemark><em> </em>the sentencing judge may continue to find by a preponderance of the evidence all facts relevant to sentencing, even if those facts increase the guideline sentencing range. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 793, 798 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 126 S.Ct. 2884, 165 L.Ed.2d 908 (2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">Vela has not carried her burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that the Government breached the plea agreement. <em>United States v. Laday, </em>56 F.3d 24, 26 (5th Cir.1995). The record is insufficiently developed for us to consider Vela\u2019s ineffective-assistance claims at this time. Accordingly, we decline to consider them. <em>See United States v. Lampazianie, </em>251 F.3d 519, 523 (5th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">Our review of the record shows that Vela\u2019s sentence-appeal waiver was knowing and voluntary and that, under the plain language of the plea agreement, the waiver applies to the circumstances at hand. <em>See United States v. Bond, </em>414 F.3d 542, 544 (5th Cir.2005). Accordingly, Vela\u2019s appeal waiver bars review of her sentencing issues raised on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b631-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
