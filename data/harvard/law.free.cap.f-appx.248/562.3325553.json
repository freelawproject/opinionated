(Zust) appeals the district court\u2019s denial of its summary judgment motion. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b584-22\">Atwood Oceanics, Inc. (Atwood) contracted with Zust in 2002 to be the packer and freight forwarder of an Atwood Beacon Drillers Control Module (DCM), which Atwood was shipping from the Port of Houston, Texas to the Republic of Singapore. The vessel bearing the DCM left Houston on October 28, 2002 and arrived in Singapore on December 15, 2002. Upon inspection, it was allegedly discovered that the boards covering the DCM\u2019s HVAC openings were broken and freshwater was in the cabin, causing $300,000 in damage. On October 19, 2004, Atwood sued Zust on contract and tort theories to recover for the damage to the DCM. Zust filed a conditional motion for summary judgment on March 28, 2006, which the district court denied on May 2, 2006. Upon Zust\u2019s motion, the district court amended its order to comply with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(b) to allow for the interlocutory appeal now before this court.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b585-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"563\">*563</page-number>Zust challenges the district court\u2019s determination that the notice provision contained in the Terms and Conditions that governed the contractual relationship between Zust and Atwood is void as a matter of law because it violates section 16.071(a) of the Texas Civil Practice <em>&amp; </em>Remedies Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-5\">Section 16.071(a) states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-6\">A contract stipulation that requires a claimant to give notice of a claim for damages as a condition precedent to the right to sue on the contract is not valid unless the stipulation is reasonable. A stipulation that requires notification within less than 90 days is void.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3DE\">Under Texas law, this statute \u201cmust be construed liberally in favor of the common right of redress and strictly against contractual infringements of that right....\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AVx\">The contract in this case provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b585-7\">9. Presenting Claims: The Company shall not be liable for any claims of any kind (whether direct or for contribution or indemnity) not presented to it in writing within 90 days of either the date of loss or incident giving rise to the claim.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ah3\">The parties do not dispute that Atwood failed to present its claim to Zust within 90 days, but the district court determined that this provision was void as a matter of public policy because it violated section 16.071(a). We agree. This provision requiring notice of a claim \u201cwithin 90 days\u201d is \u201c[a] stipulation that requires notification within less than 90 days\u201d that is void under section 16.071(a).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b585-13\">Zust argues that Texas Rule of Civil Procedure 4 and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 6(a), which state that-the day of the event is not included in the computation of a period of time prescribed in a procedural rule, somehow extend the notice requirement of the contractual provision beyond 90 days. But Zust cites no authority supporting its contention that a rule of procedure explaining how a court should compute a period of time contained in a <em>procedural </em>rule can influence the timing of a contractual provision that does not incorporate the Rules of Civil Procedure. This argument is therefore without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b585-14\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b584-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
