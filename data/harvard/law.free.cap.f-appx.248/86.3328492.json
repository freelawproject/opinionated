For the reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"88\">*88</page-number>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"AaA\">A. Offense Conduct</p>\n<p id=\"b110-4\">In July 2006, a federal grand jury indicted Kevin and his wife Lavonnia in a ten-count indictment. Pursuant to a written plea agreement, Kevin pleaded guilty to one count of distributing crack cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), and one count of sending a false distress message to the Coast Guard, in violation of 14 U.S.C. \u00a7 88(c). Lavonnia pleaded guilty to making false declarations before a grand jury, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1623.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-5\">According to the presentence investigation reports (\u201cPSI\u201d), a confidential informant purchased crack cocaine from Kevin in Savannah, Georgia on five occasions between late 2004 and early 2005. In August 2005, agents with the Drug Enforcement Administration (\u201cDEA\u201d) traveled to the Washingtons\u2019 home and seized two vehicles that had been used to facilitate drug sales. The next day, the Washingtons met with DEA agents and learned that evidence would soon be presented to the grand jury regarding Kevin\u2019s involvement in selling crack cocaine. The agents offered Kevin the opportunity to assist in the DEA\u2019s investigation of other suspects. Kevin asked for time to consider the offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-6\">On September 13, 2005, Lavonnia\u2019s brother, Timothy Sapp, initiated an emergency distress call to the Coast Guard and reported that Kevin had fallen overboard from a fishing vessel into the Wilmington River. Over the next 48 hours, the Coast Guard conducted an extensive search for Kevin, using boats, helicopters, and an airplane, but they did not find Kevin. The Coast Guard expended a total of $314,019 during the unsuccessful search. On September 28, 2005, Lavonnia contacted the DEA and solicited the agency to pay $33,000 for a diver to continue to search for Kevin\u2019s body. The DEA refused.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-7\">On October 1, 2005, a memorial service was held for Kevin at a church in Savannah. Several friends and family members spoke about Kevin, and after the ceremony, the family placed a wreath in the Wilmington River to memorialize his life.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-8\">Federal agents, however, remained suspicious of the timing and circumstances of Kevin\u2019s disappearance. Believing that Kevin was still alive, agents with the Coast Guard served Sapp a subpoena to appear before a federal grand jury in Savannah. In response, Sapp admitted to the agents that Kevin had staged his death by jumping off of the fishing vessel and boarding the boat of a friend who transported him ashore. Once Kevin reached the shore, he was driven by friends and family to Columbia, South Carolina, where he stayed for two weeks in a motel room rented for him by Lavonnia. Sapp then drove Kevin from Columbia to Yemassee, South Carolina, where he was reunited with Lavonnia. Thereafter, Kevin traveled to Virginia and then to Orlando, Florida. At some point, he assumed a false identity using forged documents.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-9\">On June 9, 2006, Lavonnia testified before the grand jury that she believed Kevin was dead and that she had not seen him since several days before the September 2005 accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-10\">Kevin was ultimately captured and arrested in Orlando, Florida on June 21, 2006. After Kevin\u2019s arrest, Lavonnia admitted that she had always known Kevin was alive and that she had seen him since the feigned boating accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b110-11\">B. Kevin\u2019s Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b110-12\">In the PSI, the probation officer calculated Kevin\u2019s offense level for the cocaine-distribution offense as 34, including a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. Find<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>ing U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2B1.1 (which pertains to economic offenses) to be the most appropriate Guideline for Kevin\u2019s false-distress-signal offense, the probation officer assessed Kevin\u2019s offense level as 18, including a 12-level enhancement for the $814,019 amount of loss incurred by the Coast Guard. Pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2, Kevin\u2019s offenses were grouped together, resulting in an adjusted offense level for the group of 34 (as the highest adjusted offense level of the offenses in the group). The probation officer then assessed a three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a), resulting in a total offense level of 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-5\">Regarding Kevin\u2019s criminal history, the probation officer stated that Kevin was sentenced to six years\u2019 probation on July 26, 1995 in state court after he pleaded guilty to cocaine possession. That probation was revoked upon Kevin\u2019s arrest for marijuana possession in February 1996, and he was imprisoned for 60 days. In November 1999, Kevin was arrested for selling cocaine, and on April 7, 2000, he pleaded guilty to the sale of a controlled substance and possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute. On that same day, Kevin\u2019s probation for his 1995 cocaine-possession conviction was revoked for the balance of the term, which the probation officer calculated as \u201cone year, three months, and 19 days.\u201d In an addendum to the PSI, the probation officer acknowledged that there were no state court records documenting precisely what constituted \u201cthe balance\u201d of Kevin\u2019s probation at the time of the April 2000 revocation. Given the unavailability of the record, the probation officer \u201csimply subtracted the amount of time [Kevin] had served on probation from the amount of time originally imposed.\u201d Because the ealculated term of imprisonment exceeded one year and one month, the probation officer assigned three criminal history points, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b111-8\">The probation officer also assessed one criminal history point each for Kevin\u2019s 1997 conviction for driving with a suspended license and his 1998 conviction for obstruction of a law enforcement officer by providing false information.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Kevin was thus assigned a total of 11 criminal history points, resulting in a criminal history category of V. With a total offense level of 31 and a criminal history category of V, Kevin\u2019s Sentencing Guidelines imprisonment range was 168 to 210 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-9\">Kevin raised several objections to the PSI. As relevant to the instant appeal, Kevin objected to: the two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice; the three criminal history points assessed for his previous conviction for cocaine possession; the criminal history point assessed for his 1997 conviction for driving with a suspended license; and the criminal history point assessed for his 1998 conviction for obstruction of a law enforcement officer. Kevin also asserted that he should receive a downward departure pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.0 because his cocaine-distribution offense had no victim and the advisory Guidelines range was unduly harsh, as it reflected the sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine.</p>\n<p id=\"b111-10\">At the sentencing hearing, Kevin reiterated his objections to the PSI and, for the first time, argued that the two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice constituted double punishment because he had agreed to pay approximately $314,019 in restitution pursuant to his plea agreement. The district court summarily overruled all of Kevin\u2019s objections and found Kevin\u2019s Guidelines range to be 168 to 210 months\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"90\">*90</page-number>imprisonment. After hearing argument from counsel, a statement from Kevin, and statements from several of Kevin\u2019s friends and family members, the court sentenced him to 188 months\u2019 imprisonment. In imposing the sentence, the court discussed the \u201cruse\u201d Kevin staged to evade authorities (that is, faking his death), the costs borne by the resource-strapped Coast Guard as a result of that ruse, and Kevin\u2019s long-time involvement in the sale and use of drugs. The court also noted \u201cthe statutory factors set in 18 U.S.C. [\u00a7 ]3553(a).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-4\">C. Lavonnia\u2019s Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b112-5\">The probation officer assigned Lavonnia a base offense level of 14, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2J1.3. The probation officer then assessed a two-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a), resulting in a total offense level of 12. With an offense level of 12 and a criminal history category of II, Lavonnia\u2019s Guidelines imprisonment range was 12 to 18 months. Lavonnia raised no objections to the PSI, but she submitted a statement to the court requesting a downward departure based on her need to care for her young child.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-6\">At the sentencing hearing, Lavonnia reiterated her request for a downward departure, asserting that her father had recently died, her mother was financially and physically dependent on her, and her young son had no other competent caregiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-7\">Before pronouncing the sentence, the district court made several statements regarding Lavonnia\u2019s conduct. As to Lavonnia\u2019s request that the DEA pay approximately $33,000 for a diver to continue searching for Kevin approximately two weeks after his disappearance, the court stated that \u201cthe most egregious conduct in the whole unfolding of the conspiracy, to have the cheek, the audacity to go and ask for more money to further a search that she knew and she had conspired with, and knew it was bogus from the outset.\u201d Regarding the plea agreement, the district court stated that it \u201cwas a great benefit to [Lavonnia], not only from the advisory guidelines range, [which was] substantially lower than [it] would have been had she been convicted of all counts in the indictment[,]\u201d but \u201cRestitution cannot be ordered to the United States Coast Guard for criminal conduct in which [Lavonnia] played a significant part.\u201d And regarding Lavonnia\u2019s motion for a downward departure, the court stated \u201cI noticed the egregious conduct of this defendant who had considerably above-average earnings, and her pursuit of more investigation, and more money, and more resources to be committed to a hunt ... that she knew was absolutely futile.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b112-9\">Accepting the calculations in the PSI, the court concluded that Lavonnia\u2019s total offense level was 12, her criminal history category was II, and her Guidelines imprisonment range was 12 to 18 months. The court also noted that the statutory maximum sentence for her offense was five years\u2019 imprisonment. Stating that \u201cher conduct in this instance merits that extra six months,\u201d the court sentenced Lavonnia to 24 months\u2019 imprisonment \u201c[p]ursuant to the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984.\u201d Lavonnia raised no objections to the sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b112-10\">II. STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b112-11\">We review for clear error the district court\u2019s findings of fact regarding the imposition of an enhancement and the assessment of criminal history points under the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Rubio, </em>317 F.3d 1240, 1244 (11th Cir.2003); <em>United States v. Hernandez-Martinez, </em>382 F.3d 1304, 1306 (11th Cir.2004). \u201c[W]hen a defendant challenges a factual basis of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"91\">*91</page-number>his sentence, the government has the burden of establishing the disputed fact by a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Polar, </em>369 F.3d 1248, 1255 (11th Cir.2004) (quotation marks omitted). \u201cIt is the district court\u2019s duty to ensure that the Government carries this burden by presenting reliable and specific evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Bernardine, </em>73 F.3d 1078, 1080 (11th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-5\">We review <em>de novo </em>the \u201cdistrict court\u2019s interpretation of the Guidelines and its application of the Guidelines to the facts.\u201d <em>United States v. McGill, </em>450 F.3d 1276, 1278 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-6\">We review the ultimate sentence imposed for reasonableness, in light of the record and the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 788 (11th Cir.2005). Our \u201c[r]eview for reasonableness is deferential,]\u201d and \u201cthe party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both [the] record and the factors in section 3553(a).\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b113-7\">And we review issues raised for the first time on appeal for plain error. <em>See United States v. Shelton, </em>400 F.3d 1325, 1328 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-8\">III. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b113-9\">In this consolidated appeal, Kevin argues that the district court erred by imposing: (1) a two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice; (2) one criminal history point each for his 1997 conviction for driving with a suspended license and his 1998 conviction for obstructing a law enforcement officer; (3) three criminal history points for his 1995 drug-possession conviction; and (4) a sentence that is unreasonable. Lavonnia argues that the district court erred by failing to give her notice that it was contemplating an upward departure. We address each argument in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b113-11\">A. Enhancement for Obstruction of Justice</p>\n<p id=\"b113-12\">Pursuant to \u00a7 3C1.1, a defendant\u2019s offense level may be increased by two levels if the court finds that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b113-13\">(A) the defendant willfully obstructed or impeded, or attempted to obstruct or impede, the administration of justice during the course of the investigation, prosecution, or sentencing of the instant offense of conviction, and (B) the obstructive conduct related to (i) the defendant\u2019s offense of conviction and any relevant conduct; or (ii) a closely related offense____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b113-14\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. Application Note 5 accompanying \u00a7 3C1.1 provides that \u201cavoiding or fleeing from arrest\u201d is a type of conduct that <em>\u201cordinarily </em>\u201d does not warrant application of this enhancement. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 3C1.1, comment. (n.5(e)) (emphasis added). Accordingly, in <em>United States v. Albert, </em>this court held that \u201csuccessfully avoiding arrest, <em>alone, </em>does not warrant an enhancement for obstruction of justice.... [T]he \u00a7 3C1.1 enhancement does not apply to persons engaged in criminal activity who learn of an investigation into that activity and simply disappear to avoid arrest, <em>without more.\u201d </em>28 F.3d 1104, 1107 (11th Cir.1994) (emphasis added). But the obstruction enhancement may be warranted if the defendant \u201cengaged in <em>additional conduct </em>while avoiding arrest, ... particularly if that conduct significantly hindered the investigation or prosecution of [his] offenses.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b113-15\">Kevin first argues that because both the two-level obstruction enhancement <em>and </em>the restitution order were imposed as a result of his false-distress-signal offense (what Kevin terms, \u201cthe obstructive offense\u201d), he has received \u201cdouble punishment\u201d for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"92\">*92</page-number>same conduct. He argues that the restitution order \u201cpunished [him] independently for the obstructive conduct\u201d because his \u201cconviction for false distress signal under 14 U.S.C. \u00a7 88(c) is what triggered the restitution.\u201d According to Kevin, this \u201cresult contradicts Application Note 7 which directs no further adjustment for obstruction unless significant further obstruction occurred,\u201d and \u201cthere was no significant further obstruction.\u201d We are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-4\">The obstruction enhancement did not constitute \u201cdouble punishment\u201d because the purpose of restitution under 14 U.S.C. \u00a7 88(c) is not to punish, but to compensate the Coast Guard for the resources it expended in responding to Kevin\u2019s false distress call. <em>See United States v. James, </em>986 F.2d 441, 444 (11th Cir.1993) (\u201c[T]he cost provision in 14 U.S.C. \u00a7 88(c) requires that [the defendant] be held liable for all costs the Coast Guard incurred in responding to [the defendant\u2019s] false distress message.\u201d). Moreover, the conduct supporting the obstruction enhancement \u2014 sending a false distress signal, faking his death, fleeing to South Carolina, holding a funeral service in which he was eulogized by friends and family, assuming a false identity using forged documents, and evading federal authorities for approximately eight months \u2014 constituted much more than the mere act of \u201csending a false distress signal\u201d and was <em>not </em>fully accounted for in the restitution Kevin was ordered to pay under 14 U.S.C. \u00a7 88(c). Rather, the obstruetion enhancement reflects (and punishes) the series of actions in which Kevin directed and participated as part of his elaborate ruse to evade federal authorities and stymie their investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-7\">Furthermore, Kevin\u2019s reliance on Application Note 7 is misplaced. Although Application Note 7 provides that an obstruction enhancement may not be applied to an obstruction offense, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1, comment, (n.7), here, the obstruction enhancement was applied to Kevin\u2019s cocaine-distribution offense. Thus, even assuming Kevin\u2019s false-distress-signal offense constitutes an \u201cobstruction offense,\u201d the obstruction enhancement was <em>not </em>applied to this offense.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b114-8\">Kevin next argues that his \u201cflight itself was insufficient to support\u201d the enhancement, and he cites Application Note 5 and <em>Alpert </em>to support this contention. He also asserts that there \u201cmay have been other motives\u201d for his flight, including fear of other drug dealers who may have known that he was considering cooperating with federal officials. To that end, he argues that he did not possess the mens rea required under the Guidelines because he did not \u201cwillfully\u201d obstruct justice. Again, we are unpersuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b114-9\">First, although Application Note 5 provides that \u201cavoiding or fleeing from arrest\u201d <em>\u201cordinarily </em>\u201d does not warrant application of the \u00a7 3C1.1 enhancement, it does not entirely foreclose the application of this enhancement, especially where the conduct <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"93\">*93</page-number>at issue involved <em>more </em>than merely \u201cavoiding or fleeing from arrest.\u201d <em>See id. </em>\u00a7 3C1.1, comment. (n.5(e)). And although we held in <em>Alpert </em>that the obstruction enhancement does not apply to persons who learn of an investigation into their criminal activity \u201cand simply disappear to avoid arrest, <em>without more,\u201d </em>we also held that the obstruction enhancement may be warranted if the defendant \u201cengaged in <em>additional conduct </em>while avoiding arrest, ... particularly if that conduct significantly hindered the investigation or prosecution of [his] offenses.\u201d <em>Alpert, </em>28 F.3d at 1107 (emphasis added). Contrary to his assertions, Kevin did \u201cmore\u201d than \u201csimply disappear to avoid arrest.\u201d Kevin not only sent a false distress signal to the Coast Guard, he faked his death, fled the state of Georgia, had his wife and others hold a memorial service for him, assumed a false identity using forged documents, and evaded authorities for approximately eight months. Thus, Kevin \u201cengaged in additional conduct while avoiding arrest,\u201d and this conduct significantly hindered the investigation and prosecution of his underlying offense (cocaine distribution). <em>See id. </em>As such, Kevin\u2019s reliance on Application Note 5 and <em>Alpert </em>is misplaced.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-5\">We also reject Kevin\u2019s argument that he lacked the mens rea of \u201cwillfulness\u201d required under the Guidelines. The timing of Kevin\u2019s feigned death, his subsequent efforts to evade law enforcement (for example, assuming a false identity by using forged documents, and fleeing to South Carolina, Virginia, and ultimately to Florida), his family\u2019s ongoing cover-up of the ruse, and the substantial degree of planning required to execute the ruse all create a strong inference that Kevin \u201cwillfully\u201d obstructed and impeded the Government\u2019s efforts to investigate and prosecute him for his cocaine-distribution activities. That Kevin\u2019s actions may <em>also </em>have been motivated by his fear of other drug dealers is of no moment.</p>\n<p id=\"b115-7\">B. Criminal History Points for Driving with a Suspended License &amp; Obstructing Law Enforcement by Providing False Information</p>\n<p id=\"b115-8\">Section 4A1.1 of the Sentencing Guidelines sets forth the number of criminal history points to assign to certain prior convictions based on a variety of factors, including the length of imprisonment imposed. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.1; <em>United States v. Glover, </em>154 F.3d 1291, 1293 n. 3 (11th Cir.1998). Under \u00a7 4Al.l(a), the district court must assess three criminal history points for each prior sentence of imprisonment exceeding one year and one month. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(a). Pursuant to \u00a7 4Al.l(b), the district court must assign two criminal history points for each prior sentence of imprisonment of at least 60 days that is not counted in \u00a7 4Al.l(a). <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4Al.l(b). And under \u00a7 4Al.l(c), one criminal history point is to be added for each prior sentence that is not included in \u00a7 4Al.l(a) and \u00a7 4Al.l(b). <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4Al.l(c). Sentences imposed for certain enumerated offenses, such as \u201c[d]riving without a license or with a revoked or suspended license\u201d and providing \u201c[f]alse information to a police officer[,]\u201d are counted \u201conly if (A) the sentence was a term of probation of at least one year or a term of imprisonment of at least thirty days, or (B) the prior offense was similar to an instant offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4A1.2(c)(l).</p>\n<p id=\"b115-9\">\u201cA conviction for which the imposition or execution of sentence was totally suspended or stayed shall be counted as a prior sentence under \u00a7 4Al.l(c).\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4A1.2(a)(3). To that end, Application Note 2 accompanying \u00a7 4A1.1 provides that \u201c[f]or the purposes of applying \u00a7 4Al.l(a), (b), or (c), the length of a sentence of imprisonment is <em>the stated maxi</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number><em>mum </em>.... That is, criminal history points are based on the sentence <em>pronounced, </em>not the length of time actually served.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4A1.2, comment, (n.2) (emphasis added). Thus, for example, in <em>United States v. Baker, </em>116 F.3d 870 (11th Cir.1997), following the defendant\u2019s conviction in state court for writing worthless checks, the state court sentenced him to one year of probation, contingent upon his paying the assessed fees. <em>Id. </em>at 873. This court applied the \u201cstated maximum\u201d rule and held that \u201cthe length of the probationary sentence <em>received by </em>\u201d the defendant \u201cis \u2014 for the purpose of computing his criminal history score \u2014 one year, the \u2018stated maximum.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 874 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-4\">Here, the PSI states that Kevin pleaded guilty to driving with a suspended driver\u2019s license in 1997, and he was sentenced to 12 months\u2019 probation and ordered to pay a $400 f\u00edne. The PSI also states that in 1998, Kevin pleaded guilty to obstructing a law enforcement officer by providing false information, and he was given a suspended sentence of 12 months\u2019 probation and ordered to pay a $150 fine. Kevin was assessed one criminal history point for each of these offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-5\">Kevin asserts that the one year of probation imposed following his 1997 conviction for driving with a suspended license was contingent on payment of a fine, and once he paid the fine, the probation was terminated. He further asserts that the state court suspended the one year of probation imposed following his 1998 conviction for obstructing a law enforcement officer by providing false information. Thus, according to Kevin, because he did not actually serve the probation imposed for either the 1997 or the 1998 convictions, the assessment of a criminal history point for each of these convictions was in error. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-6\">As stated above, the Guidelines provide that sentences imposed for driving \u201cwith a revoked or suspended license\u201d and providing \u201c[f]alse information to a police offieer[,]\u201d are counted in assessing criminal history points if, <em>inter alia, </em>\u201cthe sentence was a term of probation of at least one year.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(l). And \u201ccriminal history points are based on the sentence <em>pronounced, </em>not the length of time actually served.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 4A1.2, comment. (n.2) (emphasis added); <em>Baker, </em>116 F.3d at 873 n. 6 (\u201c[T]he relevant inquiry is what sentence was <em>imposed, </em>not what sentence was actually <em>served.\u201d). </em>Because the sentence actually <em>pronounced </em>following each of the offenses at issue was one year of probation, the assessment of one criminal history point for each of these offenses was not erroneous. That Kevin may not have actually served one year of probation for these offenses is irrelevant. <em>See Baker, </em>116 F.3d at 873 n. 6.</p>\n<p id=\"b116-7\">C. Criminal History Points for Cocaine Possession</p>\n<p id=\"b116-8\">As discussed above, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(a), the district court must assess three criminal history points for each prior sentence of imprisonment exceeding one year and one month, and under \u00a7 4Al.l(b), the district court must assign two criminal history points for each prior sentence of imprisonment of at least 60 days that is not counted in \u00a7 4Al.l(a). U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(a), (b).</p>\n<p id=\"b116-9\">On appeal, Kevin argues that the assignment of three criminal history points for his 1995 cocaine-possession conviction is \u201cspeculative\u201d because there is no record evidence that he served more than one year and one month in prison as a result of this conviction. Kevin states that as a result of his 1999 arrest for selling cocaine, in April 2000, he was convicted of selling and distributing cocaine in violation of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"95\">*95</page-number>state law, and he was sentenced to six years and six months of imprisonment. He contends that the probation imposed for his 1995 conviction was revoked following his 2000 convictions, and \u201c[t]he time served for revocation was served concurrently with the sentence\u201d imposed for these convictions. In support of this contention, Kevin submits a document from the Superior Court of Chatham County, Georgia, which shows that on April 7, 2000, his probation was revoked \u201cin full,\u201d and the time to be served upon revocation would \u201crun concurrent\u201d with the sentence imposed for his 2000 convictions. According to Kevin, however, there is \u201cno other specific evidence\u201d regarding how much time he actually served in prison as a result of his 1995 cocaine-possession conviction, and absent \u201cspecific information\u201d regarding \u201cthe exact amount of time served\u201d following the April 2000 revocation, \u201cit is impossible to know how many criminal history points should be assessed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b117-5\">We need not address these arguments, however, because even had the Government failed to establish that the balance of Kevin\u2019s 1995-imposed probation exceeded one year and one month at the time of the April 2000 revocation, the resulting error was harmless, as Kevin\u2019s Guidelines imprisonment range would remain unchanged. Kevin does not dispute that he was confined for 60 days following a 1996 revocation of his 1995-imposed probation. And, pursuant to \u00a7 4Al.l(b), the district court must assign two criminal history points for each prior sentence of imprisonment of at least 60 days. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Al.l(b). Thus, even excluding the April 2000 revocation, the 60 days of imprisonment Kevin served pursuant to the 1996 revocation would result in the assessment of two criminal history points. Kevin would therefore have 10 total criminal history points, which would result in a criminal history category of V, as the district court determined. <em>See </em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual, ch. 5, pt. A (2006) (Sentencing Table). As such, Kevin\u2019s Guidelines imprisonment range would remain unchanged at 168 to 210 months. <em>See id. </em>Accordingly, even had the district court erred in assessing three criminal history points for the 1995 cocaine-possession offense, the error was harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"b117-7\">D. Reasonableness of Kevin\u2019s Sentence</p>\n<p id=\"b117-8\">After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), sentencing requires two steps. \u201cFirst, the district court must consult the Guidelines,\u201d which, \u201cat a minimum, obliges the district court to calculate <em>correctly </em>the sentencing range prescribed by the Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Crawford, </em>407 F.3d 1174, 1178 (11th Cir.2005). The district court must then impose a sentence that is reasonable in light of the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. These factors include: the nature and circumstances of the offense, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1); the history and characteristics of the defendant, <em>id.; </em>the need- for the sentence to reflect the seriousness of the offense, promote respect for the law, and provide just punishment for the offense, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A); the need for the sentence to afford adequate deterrence, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B); the need to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B); and the Guidelines imprisonment range, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(4)(A). Although sentencing courts must be guided by these factors, the district court is not required to state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of these factors or to discuss each of these factors. <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>446 F.3d 1348, 1357 (11th Cir.2006). Moreover, \u201c[t]he weight to be ac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>corded any given \u00a7 3558(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court[,]\u201d and \u201c[w]e will not substitute our judgment in weighing the relevant factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>456 F.3d 1353, 1363 (11th Cir.2006) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b118-4\">Kevin argues that his sentence is unreasonable in light of <em>Booker </em>and \u00a7 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) because \u201c[a] substantially lesser sentence would definitely comply with the purposes of sentencing and would be more than adequate to deter this type of misconduct.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-5\">First, as we concluded above, the district court correctly calculated Kevin\u2019s Guidelines imprisonment range as 168 to 210 months. Moreover, noting \u201cthe statutory factors set in 18 U.S.C. [\u00a7 ]3553(a),\u201d the court discussed Kevin\u2019s history of drug use, his past participation in drug sales, the death \u201cruse\u201d he staged to evade authorities, and the costs incurred by the Coast Guard during its efforts to search for him upon receiving the false distress signal. Thus, it is clear that, in accordance with <em>Booker, </em>the court discussed and considered Kevin\u2019s history and characteristics, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), the nature and circumstances of the offense, <em>see id., </em>the seriousness of the offense, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A), and the need to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(B). And although a sentence within the Guidelines range is not <em>per se </em>reasonable, when, as here, \u201cthe district court imposes a sentence within the advisory Guidelines range, we ordinarily will expect that choice to be a reasonable one.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 788. We therefore conclude that Kevin has failed to carry his burden of establishing that the 188-month sentence is unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-9\">E. Upward Departure</p>\n<p id=\"b118-10\">Lavonnia argues that the district court erred by failing to give her notice that it was contemplating an upward departure before imposing sentence. Because Lavonnia did not raise this argument to the district court, we review it for plain error. <em>See Shelton, </em>400 F.3d at 1328. Under the plain error standard, Lavonnia must show (1) error, (2) that is plain, (3) that affects her substantial rights, and (4) that \u201cseriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1329.</p>\n<p id=\"b118-11\">Rule 32(h) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure requires the district court to give the parties \u201creasonable notice that it is contemplating a departure\u201d from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"97\">*97</page-number>applicable sentencing range \u201con a ground not identified for departure either in the presentence report or in a party\u2019s prehearing submission....\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(h). But this notice requirement does not apply to a sentence outside of the advisory Guidelines range as a result of the district court\u2019s imposition of a variance in light of the factors set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Irizarry, </em>458 F.3d 1208, 1212 (11th Cir.2006), <em>petition for cert. filed, </em>(U.S. Oct. 26, 2006) (No. 06-7517). To that end, in <em>Irizarry, </em>this court held that \u201c[a]fter <em>Booker, </em>parties are inherently on notice that the sentencing guidelines range is advisory\u201d and \u201ccannot claim unfair surprise or inability to present informed comment ... when a district court imposes a sentence above the guidelines range based on the section 3553(a) sentencing factors.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b119-5\">Here, it is clear that the district court did not impose a Guidelines \u201cdeparture,\u201d rather, the court imposed a <em>variance </em>\u2014 an above-the-Guidelines sentence based upon its consideration of the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a). First, the district court did not cite to a specific Guidelines departure provision. <em>See United States v. Eldick, </em>443 F.3d 783, 788 n. 2 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 251, 166 L.Ed.2d 196 (2006). Second, during the sentencing hearing, the district court\u2019s discussion of Lavonnia\u2019s \u201cegregious\u201d act of requesting \u201cmore money to further a search that she knew\u201d to be \u201cbogus from the outset,\u201d even though she \u201chad considerably above-average earnings\u201d indicates that the court considered the nature and circumstances of the offense, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1), and Lavonnia\u2019s history and characteristics, <em>see id. </em>The court also stated that Lavonnia\u2019s \u201cconduct in this instance merits that extra six months\u201d; Lavonnia had received a \u201cgreat benefit\u201d from her plea agreement because restitution could not be ordered to the Coast Guard \u201cfor criminal conduct in which [Lavonnia] played a significant part\u201d; and \u201cthe advisory guidelines range\u201d is \u201csubstantially lower\u201d than had Lavonnia been convicted of all counts in the indictment. The court also noted that the statutory maximum sentence for Lavonnia\u2019s offense is five years\u2019 imprisonment. These statements demonstrate that the court considered the seriousness of Lavonnia\u2019s offense, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A), and the advisory Guidelines range, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 3553(a)(4). Thus, rather than impose a Guidelines departure, the district court exercised its post <em>-Booker </em>discretion to impose a reasonable sentence outside the Guidelines range because it concluded that a sentence inside of that range was inadequate. Because the district court did not impose a Guidelines departure, it was under no obligation to give Lavonnia advance notice under Rule 32(h). <em>See Irizarry, </em>458 F.3d at 1212.</p>\n<p id=\"b119-8\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b119-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the sentences.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b111-6\">. Kevin was sentenced to one year of probation for each of these convictions.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b114-5\">. As discussed above, Kevin\u2019s offense level for the cocaine-distribution offense was calculated as 34, including the two-level enhancement for obstruction of justice, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3C1.1. Kevin's offense level for sending a false distress signal was calculated as 18, including a 12-level enhancement for the $314,019 amount of loss incurred by the Coast Guard, pursuant to \u00a7 2B 1.1 (b)(1)(G). Thus, an enhancement for obstruction of justice was <em>not </em>applied to the false-distress-signal offense. Pursuant to \u00a7 3D 1.2, Kevin's cocaine-distribution offense was grouped with his false-distress-signal offense, resulting in an adjusted offense level for the group of 34 (which is the highest adjusted offense level of the two offenses in the group). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3D1.2(a)-(c). Kevin\u2019s offense level was then reduced by three levels assessed for his acceptance of responsibility, pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(a), resulting in a total offense level of 31.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b118-6\">. Kevin also argues that the district court erred by denying his motion for a downward departure because his criminal history score over-represents the seriousness of his criminal history, and the Guidelines\u2019 100-to-l ratio between crack and powder cocaine is unduly harsh. Because nothing in the record suggests that the district court believed it lacked the authority to downwardly depart, we lack jurisdiction to review the court\u2019s refusal to do so. <em>See United States v. Dudley, </em>463 F.3d 1221, 1228 (11th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1245 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b118-7\">. In this circuit, we do not presume that a sentence within the properly calculated Guidelines range is reasonable. <em>See United States v. Hunt, </em>459 F.3d 1180, 1185 (11th Cir.2006). \"Recently, however, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld other circuits\u2019 decisions affording such a presumption, noting that a sentence, independently calculated by the district court in accordance with <em>Booker, </em>that falls within the properly calculated Guidelines range 'significantly increases the likelihood that the sentence is a reasonable one.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>491 F.3d 1306, 1313 (11th Cir.2007) (citing <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. -, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)). \"We recognize that the Court\u2019s rationale in <em>Rita </em>calls into question our reasons for not affording a presumption of reasonableness.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1314 n. 8 (contrasting <em>Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2463-67, with <em>Hunt, </em>459 F.3d at 1185).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
