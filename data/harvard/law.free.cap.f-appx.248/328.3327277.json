As the appeal presents no substantial question, we will summarily affirm the order of the District Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-28\">Following a guilty plea, Ishola was convicted of conspiracy to commit identification fraud pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1028(a)(7), (b)(2)(B) and (f) in January 2004. He did not file a direct appeal or a motion to vacate or set aside his sentence pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. In April 2007, Ishola filed a petition for a writ of error coram nobis. The District Court construed the petition as raising three claims: (1) the Government violated the plea agreement by not resolving who opened and obtained money from certain bank accounts; (2) Ishola\u2019s counsel, the prosecutor, and the Court overlooked the substantial assistance he provided in identifying the leader of the conspiracy; and (3) a possible argument that Ishola\u2019s sub<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>stantial assistance warranted a reduction of sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">The District Court properly found that Ishola could seek relief using coram nobis, as he had served his sentence for the conviction, but was continuing to suffer continuing consequences. However, we agree with the District Court that because Ishola could have pursued his claims on direct appeal or in a motion filed pursuant to \u00a7 2255, he failed to show sound reasons for failing to seek relief earlier. Thus, Ishola did not meet the requirements for coram nobis relief. <em>See United States v. Stoneman, </em>870 F.2d 102, 106 (3d Cir.1989); <em>United States v. Osser, </em>864 F.2d 1056, 1062 (3d Cir.1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we will summarily affirm the order of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
