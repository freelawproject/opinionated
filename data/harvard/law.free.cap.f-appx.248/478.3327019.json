Tucker argues that this court improperly affords a presumption of reasonableness to sentences that fall within the properly calculated guidelines range, and that the sentence he received exceeded the term necessary to effectuate the sentencing objectives set forth in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a) (West 2000 <em>&amp; </em>Supp.2006). As we conclude that neither claim has merit, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-21\">At sentencing, the parties agreed that the applicable advisory guidelines range was seventy to eight-seven months\u2019 imprisonment. The eighty-four month term of imprisonment imposed by the district court falls within that range.<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> Moreover, the term is substantially below the twenty-year maximum authorized by 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(C) (2000). Accordingly, Tucker\u2019s sentence is presumptively reasonable. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>445 F.3d 339, 341 (4th Cir.2006). Although Tucker challenges the validity and constitutionality of this presumption of reasonableness, the Supreme Court recently upheld our appli<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>cation of the presumption, <em>Rita v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 208 (2007), and Tucker offers no compelling argument to rebut it. Accordingly, Tucker\u2019s challenge fails. We further reject Tucker\u2019s conclusory contention that his sentence exceeds that which would be necessary to fulfill the sentencing objectives enumerated in 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b501-7\">We affirm Tucker\u2019s sentence. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b501-8\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b500-14\"> Although Tucker\u2019s brief states that he received an eighty-seven month sentence, the judgment provides a term of eighty-four months' imprisonment.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
