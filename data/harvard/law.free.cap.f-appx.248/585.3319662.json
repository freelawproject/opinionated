Garrett contends that he filed a Step One grievance based on deliberate indifference but could not timely file it because he was first in a hospital and then in a prison infirmary during the fifteen-day period allowed him by prison procedures for filing a Step One grievance. The magistrate judge noted in his consent opinion that the evidence showed Garrett had filed another, unrelated grievance based on a disciplinary matter that was timely filed within the fifteen-day period during which Garrett had to file his Step One grievance on the deliberate indifference matter. Thus, the magistrate judge concluded Garrett could have also timely filed the latter grievance.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-11\">We review <em>de novo </em>a dismissal of a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint for failure to exhaust administrative remedies pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e. <em>Days v. Johnson, </em>322 F.3d 863, 866 (5th Cir.2003). As amended, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a) (West 2003) provides that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b608-15\">No action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under section 1983 of this title, or any other Federal law, by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b608-16\">Exhaustion is mandatory, and we have strictly construed the exhaustion requirement of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e. <em>Days, </em>322 F.3d at 866.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-17\">In <em>Days, </em>a Texas inmate alleged that he was unable to comply timely with the prison grievance procedure due to a serious injury. We vacated the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint for failure to exhaust administrative remedies and remanded the case. We determined that because Days\u2019s injury prevented him from timely filing a grievance and his untimely grievances were returned unprocessed, Days had exhausted the administrative remedies that were personally available to him. 322 F.3d at 867.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-18\">Unlike the inmate in <em>Days, </em>the evidence properly admitted into court shows that Garrett did not attempt to exhaust the administrative remedies that were personally available to him. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the dismissal of Garrett\u2019s civil rights complaint for failure to exhaust available administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b608-19\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b608-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
