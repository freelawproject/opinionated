Lopez Alfaro asserts that the waiver of appeal in her plea agreement is invalid because the government breached the plea agreement. She contends that the government violated U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.8 and, consequently, the plea agreement when it used statements she made during debriefing to oppose her request for an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1. Lopez Alfaro further contends that the district court erred in failing to grant an acceptance adjustment, because she pleaded guilty, agreed with the factual resume, and debriefed for the government. Lopez Alfaro\u2019s arguments are unavailing.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-9\">This court considers whether the government breached a plea agreement even if, as here, the agreement contains an appeal wavier provision. <em>United States v. Branam, </em>231 F.3d 931, 931 n. 1 (5th Cir.2000). We ordinarily review <em>de novo </em>whether the government has breached a plea agreement. <em>See United States v. Reeves, </em>255 F.3d 208, 210 (5th Cir.2001). Because Lopez Alfaro did not argue breach in the district court, however, review is for plain error. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b600-14\">To show plain error, Lopez Alfaro must demonstrate \u201c(1) there was an error; (2) the error was clear and obvious; and (3) the error affected [her] substantial rights. When these elements are present, [this Court] may exercise [its] discretion to correct the error only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Gracia-Cantu, </em>302 F.3d 308, 310 (5th Cir.2002) (internal quotation and citation omitted). We apply the general principles of contract law to interpret the terms of a plea agreement. <em>Hentz v. Hargett, </em>71 F.3d 1169, 1173 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b600-15\">Lopez Alfaro contends that the government violated \u00a7 1B1.8 and, consequently, the plea agreement when it used statements she made during debriefing to oppose her request for an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility under \u00a7 3E1.1. The government informed the district court that Lopez Alfaro had been uncooperative during debriefing because she refused to identify certain financial institutions. Thus, the government did not disclose facially self-incriminating information as prohibited by \u00a7 1B1.8. There was no error that is plain or obvious. Accordingly, because the government did not violate \u00a7 1B1.8, it did not breach the plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b600-16\">Lopez Alfaro\u2019s reliance on <em>United States v. Keresztury, </em>293 F.3d 750, 755-57 (5th Cir.2002), in support of her argument that the government improperly relied on her debriefing statements is misplaced. The government did not make any specific promises in the plea agreement regarding an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility under \u00a7 3E1.1. Thus, the government did not breach an express provision <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"579\">*579</page-number>of the agreement when it opposed an adjustment for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b601-5\">Because Lopez Alfaro has failed to establish that the government breached the plea agreement, the waiver of appeal is enforceable and bars the appeal. Accordingly, the judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b600-10\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
