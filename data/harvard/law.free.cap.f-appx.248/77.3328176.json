According to Brooks, these risks, of which he was not informed, included that, upon conviction, he would receive a life sentence as a recidivist offender, under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841, and that if sentenced to life, he would not be eligible for parole. On appeal, Brooks argues the district court erred by rejecting his claims, because he satisfied his burden under the two-part test of <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 687-88, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-14\">A district court\u2019s legal conclusions in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 proceeding are reviewed <em>de novo, </em>and its factual findings are reviewed for clear error. <em>Lynn v. United States, </em>365 F.3d 1225, 1232 (11th Cir.2004). Whether a defendant ultimately has received ineffective assistance of counsel is a mixed question of fact and law reviewed <em>de novo. Mincey v. Head, </em>206 F.3d 1106, 1142 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b100-15\">After thorough review of the record and careful consideration of the parties\u2019 arguments, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b100-16\">The relevant facts are straightforward. After Brooks pled not guilty to the charged cocaine conspiracy, a jury ultimately returned a guilty verdict. He was sentenced, as a recidivist, to a life term, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841. At the sentencing hearing, the district court inquired as to Brooks\u2019s trial counsel\u2019s position regarding the \u201cstatutory mandatory minimum sentence,\u201d and counsel responded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b100-17\">Judge, I thought I had a good argument. There is a distinction between prior felonies when you look at career guideline <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"79\">*79</page-number>definition, but I did some more research between the time Mr. Elder submitted the report to you and today, and there is an [Eleventh] Circuit case that refers to 21 United States Code Section 802 subsection I think it\u2019s 40 that has a broader definition of prior felony. In light of the <em>[United States v. Hansley, </em>54 F.3d 709 (11th Cir.1995) ] case out of the [Eleventh] Circuit, I think that the sentence would be life at this point.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b101-5\">In his memorandum of law filed in support of his \u00a7 2255 motion, Brooks claimed that he received ineffective assistance of trial counsel because, although he understood that a conviction might result in a life sentence based on the Sentencing Guidelines, counsel never advised him, in connection with his decision to plead not guilty and proceed to a jury trial, that, if convicted, he would be sentenced, as a recidivist, to a \u201cguaranteed\u201d life term, under the mandatory minimum provisions of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a). Brooks also argued that counsel was ineffective for failing to tell him that if convicted, he would be ineligible for parole. Brooks asserted that as a result of his trial attorney\u2019s ineffectiveness, he was unable to make an informed decision on whether to accept the government\u2019s plea offer of a 20-year sentence, which he \u201cprobably\u201d would have accepted had he been adequately informed.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-6\">Without holding an evidentiary hearing, the district court denied Brooks\u2019s ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims regarding his counsel\u2019s alleged failure to adequately advise him of the consequences of a conviction in connection with his \u201cnot guilty\u201d plea.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> With respect to Brooks\u2019s claim \u201cthat he was not made aware of the possibility he would serve a life sentence if he was convicted,\u201d the court concluded that Brooks did not lack a full understanding of the risks of going to trial and, consequently, was able to make an intelligent choice of whether to accept a plea or proceed to trial, because he had admitted that he was aware that he could receive a life sentence under the Sentencing Guidelines, if convicted.</p>\n<p id=\"b101-9\">As for Brooks\u2019s claim that counsel failed to advise him that a federal sentence did not include the possibility of parole, the district court determined that Brooks could not show that his trial counsel\u2019s performance was constitutionally deficient, because counsel\u2019s failure to inform Brooks about parole possibilities was objectively reasonable, particularly when compared to cases in which courts have found deficient performance based on erroneous advice concerning parole. In reaching this conclusion, the district court explained its reasoning as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b101-10\">Brooks contends that he was never made aware that a federal sentence came without the possibility of parole: \u201cI believed that if I was convicted and received a life sentence, I would be eligible for parole in seven years.\u201d Tellingly, Brooks does not assert that his counsel told him he would be eligible for parole in seven years, or even that he communicated this belief to the attorney and relied on his silence. There is considerable authority for the proposition that erroneous advice regarding parole may constitute deficient performance. <em>McAdoo v. Elo, </em>365 F.3d 487, 499 (6th Cir.2004). These courts distinguish, however, between giving bad advice and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>giving nothing at all. <em>See id. </em>(\u201cAffirmative misstatements about parole possibilities are more objectively unreasonable than failure to inform the defendant about the parole possibilities.\u201d); <em>accord James v. Cain, </em>56 F.3d 662, 667 (5th Cir.1995). Indeed, the practical significance of the distinction was noted by the Third Circuit when it determined that, while \u201ca defendant does not have a constitutional right to be provided parole eligibility information prior to entering a plea, ... any information that is provided by defense counsel must be accurate.\u201d <em>Meyers v. Gillis, </em>142 F.3d 664, 667 n. 2 (3d Cir.1998) (citations omitted).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A2\">Thus, the district court concluded that affirmative misstatements about parole possibilities were more objectively unreasonable than what occurred here \u2014 a failure to inform about those possibilities.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">The district court granted Brooks a certificate of appealability (\u201cCOA\u201d) on the following issue: \u201cwhether Petitioner was denied the right to effective assistance of counsel by his attorney\u2019s \u2018fail[ure] to inform [Petitioner] about the consequences that would result from a conviction at trial\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">\u201cThe Sixth Amendment guarantees criminal defendants the effective assistance of counsel.\u201d <em>Yarborough v. Gentry, </em>540 U.S. 1, 5, 124 S.Ct. 1, 157 L.Ed.2d 1 (2003). The legal standard governing ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims is set forth in <em>Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984), in which the Supreme Court established a two-prong test for adjudicating such claims. <em>See also Hill v. Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 58, 106 S.Ct. 366, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985)(holding that \u201cthe two-part <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>test applies to challenges to guilty pleas based on ineffective assistance of counsel\u201d). First, a movant must show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052. The proper measure of attorney performance is \u201creasonableness under prevailing professional norms.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Counsel is \u201cstrongly presumed\u201d to have rendered adequate assistance and to have exercised reasonable professional judgment. <em>Id. </em>at 690, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Counsel\u2019s performance is deficient if counsel made errors so egregious that he was not functioning as the counsel guaranteed under the Sixth Amendment. <em>Id. </em>at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052. Second, a movant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. <em>Id. </em>Where an ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim relates to the entry of a guilty plea, a movant \u201cmust show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s errors, he would ... have pleaded guilty and would [not] have insisted on going to trial.\u201d <em>Coulter v. Herring, </em>60 F.3d 1499, 1504 (11th Cir.1995) (quotation omitted) (citing <em>Hill v. Lockhart, </em>474 U.S. 52, 59, 106 S.Ct. 366 (1985)). \u201cIt is not enough for the defendant to show that the errors had some conceivable effect on the outcome of the proceeding.\u201d <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 693, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-8\">On appeal, Brooks argues that his trial counsel was ineffective for misadvis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>ing him as to his maximum sentencing exposure under the Sentencing Guidelines, rather than the life term he faced as a recidivist, under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841, and failing to tell him that he would not have the possibility of parole in connection with any sentence imposed.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Brooks asserts that had his trial counsel informed him that he faced a life sentence without the possibility of parole if convicted at trial, he \u201cprobably\u201d would have accepted the government\u2019s plea offer. Brooks maintains that because of trial counsel\u2019s misapprehension of the law, trial counsel\u2019s advice was unreasonably deficient and influenced his decision to accept the government\u2019s plea offer.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-5\">With respect to Brooks\u2019s claim that he was misadvised concerning the sentence he faced and that this somehow affected his decision to plead not guilty and proceed to trial, we are unpersuaded. Brooks alleged, based on comments made by his attorney at sentencing, that counsel mistakenly did not think that Brooks faced a mandatory life sentence under 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841, but rather that Brooks faced a Guidelines sentence of something less than life imprisonment. At no point, however, has Brooks <em>ever </em>so much as alleged that his trial counsel relayed this information to him, in connection -with the plea negotiations, which had occurred <em>well </em>before Brooks\u2019s sentencing hearing. Indeed, in his \u00a7 2255 filings, Brooks acknowledged the he was aware he faced a life sentence if convicted at trial. On this record, because Brooks never alleged that counsel relayed any \u201cmiscalculation\u201d with him during plea negotiations, Brooks failed to allege a sufficient ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-7\">As for Brooks\u2019s claim concerning his attorney\u2019s failure to tell him that he would not be eligible for parole, in <em>Holmes v. United States, </em>876 F.2d 1545, 1552 (11th Cir.1989), we considered a similar issue, although we \u201cle[ft] open the issue of what circumstances may exist under which eironeous advice as to eligibility for parole may be deemed constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d In <em>Holmes, </em>we recognized, however, a \u201cdistinction between failure to inform and giving misinformation\u201d and noted that the failure to inform is less likely to constitute ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>Id. </em>n. 8 (citing <em>Strader v. Garrison, </em>611 F.2d 61, 64-65 (4th Cir.1979)(holding that misinformation of parole consequences is ineffective assistance of counsel)).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">Moreover, in <em>United States v. Campbell, </em>778 F.2d 764 (11th Cir.1985), we found that an attorney did not render ineffective assistance by failing to inform a defendant of \u201ccollateral consequences,\u201d which we also have held include parole eligibility, as opposed to \u201cdirect consequences,\u201d resulting from of a guilty plea. <em>See </em>778 F.2d at 768 (failure to inform defendant of collateral consequences is not ineffective assistance); <em>Holmes, </em>876 F.2d at 1549 (\u201cparole eligibility is a collateral rather than a direct consequence of a guilty plea\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Morse, </em>36 F.3d 1070, 1072 (11th Cir.1994) (holding that a district court\u2019s failure to inform a defendant of potential parole implications does not violate the requirement that a plea be voluntary and an intelligent choice among the alternative courses of action (citing <em>Holmes, </em>876 F.2d at 1548)).</p>\n<p id=\"b104-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>From our review of the record, it is clear that Brooks\u2019s allegations concern a failure to inform, and not misinformation, and accordingly the district court did not err by rejecting Brooks\u2019s ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim. This conclusion is further supported by the fact that Brooks has acknowledged that he was aware that he could receive a sentence of life imprisonment if he proceeded to trial and was convicted, and so he was aware of his maximum possible sentence. Moreover, since we held that parole eligibility is only a collateral consequence of a guilty plea, and that counsel is not ineffective for failing to advise on collateral consequences, trial counsel\u2019s failure to inform Brooks regarding parole did not constitute objectively unreasonable performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-4\">Finally, we note that even if Brooks satisfied his burden on the first prong of <em>Strickland, </em>he would not be able to satisfy the prejudice prong of the two-part test. The record reflects that throughout the entire case, Brooks had not expressed any desire or intent to plead guilty. In his declaration, Brooks asserted that he was wrongly accused and the testimony of his codefendants that implicated him in unsuccessful attempts to purchase cocaine and marijuana was false. He also said that had he been allowed to testify at trial, he would have explained that he was not aware of any drug deals and did not know most of his codefendants. Even in this Court, he says only that he \u201cprobably\u201d would have pled guilty. On this record, which includes Brooks\u2019s adamant and consistent assertions of innocence and his skepticism regarding the government\u2019s plea offer, we cannot conclude that but for either of the instances of alleged ineffecfive, Brooks would have pled guilty, or that even if he did, the district court would have accepted the plea.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b104-7\">In sum, the district court did not clearly err in its factual findings, nor did it commit legal error, in its analysis and denial of Brooks\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b104-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b101-7\">. The district court referred to a magistrate judge consideration of Brooks\u2019s claim that counsel was ineffective by allegedly preventing him from testifying. After an evidentiary hearing on that claim, the magistrate judge recommended denial of the claim. In its final order, the district court adopted the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation. The disposition of that claim is not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b102-6\">. In issuing the COA, the district court stated: When the Court determined that counsel's failure to inform Petitioner of the non-possibility of parole did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel, it relied upon cases from the Third, Fifth, and Sixth Circuits because the Eleventh Circuit has not addressed the question. Although the Court believes that [counsel\u2019s] failure, if true, to inform Petitioner that the sentence resulting from a federal conviction comes without the possibility of parole does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel, the Eleventh Circuit should be given an opportunity to consider the question.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b103-6\">. As an initial matter, we disagree with the government's suggestion that the COA does not encompass both of these arguments. Construing the issue specified in the COA, in light of the pleadings and other parts of the record, we will address Brooks's \u201cmiscalculation\u201d claim, as it reasonably comes with the context of his parole claim and the COA issued for that claim.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b104-5\">. We also reject Brook's argument that he was entitled to an evidentiary hearing on his \u00a7 2255 motion. He failed to satisfy his burden to \"allege[] facts that, if true, would entitle him to relief.\u201d <em>Aron v. United States, </em>291 F.3d 708, 714-15 (11th Cir.2002) (citation omitted).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
