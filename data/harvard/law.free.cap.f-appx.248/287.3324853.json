SMITH, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b310-14\">Petitioner Timothy E. Flake asks this Court to reverse the decision of the Administrative Review Board (\u201cARB\u201d) of the U.S. Department of Labor and hold that his former employer, New World Pasta Company, was covered by the whistleblower protection provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Respondent is the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Labor.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Secretary maintains that Flake\u2019s whistleblower claim was discharged when New World Pasta emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy. New World Pasta intervened in this case to assert that Flake\u2019s claim was discharged and, in the alternative, that the ARB\u2019s decision was correct. We will deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-19\">In 1999, New World Pasta registered an issue, due in 2009, of 9/4 percent Senior Subordinated Notes in the principal amount of $160 million with the Securities Exchange Commission. At all times since the issue, there have been fewer than 300 record holders of the notes. The indenture agreement governing the notes required New World Pasta to file a copy of \u201call quarterly and annual financial information that would be required to be contained in a filing with the [Securities Exchange] Commission on Forms 10-Q and 10-K if the Company were required to file such forms,\u201d and \u201call current reports that would be required to be filed with the Commission on Form 8-K if the Company were required to file such reports.\u201d According to the agreement, such filings were to be made \u201c[w]hether or not [they were] required by the Commission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b310-20\">Flake was employed by New World Pasta as its Corporate Controller and Chief Accounting Officer. Flake was suspended by New World Pasta on November 11, 2002. On January 29, 2003, he filed a complaint with the Occupational Safety <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>and Health Administration (\u201cOSHA\u201d) pursuant to the whistleblower protection provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1514A (\u201cthe Act\u201d). He alleged that New World Pasta retaliated against him because he had informed his supervisor of material accounting irregularities. Flake\u2019s employment was terminated on March 21, 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">OSHA investigated Flake\u2019s complaint and, on April 9, 2003, found that New World Pasta had not violated the Act. <em>See </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 42121(b)(2) and 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1980.105(a)(2) and (b). On May 12, 2003, Flake filed objections to OSHA\u2019s findings and requested a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (\u201cALJ\u201d). <em>See </em>49 U.S.C. \u00a7 42121(b)(2)(A) and 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1980.106(a). On July 7, 2003, the ALJ granted New World Pasta\u2019s motion for summary decision on the grounds that New World Pasta was not covered by the whistleblower protection provision of the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">Flake appealed to the ARB on July 21, 2003. On February 25, 2004, the ARB affirmed the ALJ\u2019s decision and dismissed the complaint. On April 20, 2004, Flake petitioned this Court for review of the ARB\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">On May 10, 2004, New World Pasta filed a voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101 et seq. On or about May 27, 2004, Flake was served with notice of the bankruptcy case by mail. On June 7, 2004, Flake filed a letter which was construed as a motion for a suggestion of bankruptcy in this Court, and which was granted on June 22, 2004. The appeal was stayed until either the automatic stay in the bankruptcy case was lifted or the claims discharged. New World Pasta emerged from bankruptcy on December 7, 2005. The plan of reorganization discharged all pre-petition claims against the company and enjoined the prosecution of discharged claims. <em>See </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1141; 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 524.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-10\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-11\">Flake asserts that the ARB\u2019s decision that the terms of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1514A(a) do not apply to New World Pasta is erroneous. The relevant portions of section 1514A provide that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b311-12\">No company with a class of securities registered under section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. <em>781), </em>or that is required to file reports under section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78o(d)), ... may discharge, demote, suspend, threaten, harass, or in any other manner discriminate against an employee in the terms and conditions of employment because of any lawful act done by the employee \u2014 (1) to provide information ... regarding any conduct which the employee reasonably believes constitutes a violation of section 1341,1343, 1344, or 1348, any rule or regulation of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or any provision of Federal law relating to fraud against shareholders, when the information or assistance is provided to ... (C) a person with supervisory authority over the employee</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number><em>Id. </em>Flake does not contest that New World Pasta does not have a class of securities registered under section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act. Instead, Flake asserts that New World Pasta was subject to the whistleblower protection provision in \u00a7 1514A(a) because it had publicly traded debt and it was required to file reports under section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act. New World Pasta asserts that because it had fewer than 300 record holders at the time Flake was hired through his termination, it was not required to make any filings with the Commission pursuant to section 15(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b312-4\">Flake\u2019s argument that New World Pasta is required to file reports under section 15(d) of the Securities Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78o(d), is premised on the terms of the indenture agreement. He asserts that even if New World Pasta was not statutorily required to file reports, the agreement with its debtholders is sufficient to show that the company was required to make such filings \u201cunder section 15(d).\u201d We do not need to resolve this question, however, because Flake\u2019s claim was discharged in the bankruptcy proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">The confirmation order of New World Pasta\u2019s reorganization plan was issued on November 21, 2005. The order stipulated that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-6\">[A]ll existing Claims against ... the Debtors shall be, and shall be deemed, discharged and terminated, and all holders of Claims ... shall be precluded and enjoined from asserting against the Debtors ... any other or further Claim ... based upon any act or omission, transaction, or other activity of any kind or nature that occurred prior to the Effective Date....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b312-7\">[Ejach holder ... of a Claim ... shall be deemed to have forever waived, released, and discharged the Debtors, to the fullest extent permitted by section 1141 of the Bankruptcy Code, of and from any and all Claims, rights, and liabilities that arose prior to the Effective Date. Upon the Effective Date, all such persons forever shall be precluded and enjoined, pursuant to section 524 of the Bankruptcy Code, from prosecuting or asserting any such discharged Claim against ... the Debtors.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">Flake received multiple notices regarding the bankruptcy proceedings. His name and address appeared on the service lists for the \u201cNotice of Commencement of Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Cases,\u201d dated June 4, 2004; the \u201cNotice of Motion of Debtors for Order Establishing a Bar Dates For Filing Proofs of Claim and Approving the Manner and Notice Thereof,\u201d dated August 13, 2004; a notice of various motions by the debtors, including scheduling a hearing and establishing a hearing for confirmation of the reorganization plan, dated July 29, 2005; and on \u201cSchedule F\u2014 Creditors Holding Unsecured Non-Priority Claims.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b312-10\">As a known creditor of New World Pasta, Flake was entitled to actual written notice of the bankruptcy filing and bar date for claims. <em>See, e.g., City of New York v. New York, N.H. &amp; H.R. Co., </em>344 U.S. 293, 296, 73 S.Ct. 299, 97 L.Ed. 333 (1953); <em>Chemetron Corp. v. Jones, </em>72 F.3d 341, 346 (3d Cir.1995). The bankruptcy filings indicate that he was served with the requisite notice, and he does not suggest otherwise. To the contrary, Flake wrote to this Court that he had been \u201cinformed by counsel for New World Pasta Corporation that they have filed for bankruptcy,\u201d and expressed his opinion that his \u201cappeal must be stayed pending the completion of the bankruptcy proceeding.\u201d His letter was construed as a suggestion of bankruptcy and was accepted. Accordingly, Flake received due process of law. <em>See, e.g., Jones v. Chemetron Corp., </em>212 F.3d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>199, 209 (3d Cir.2000) (\u201c[I]f a potential claimant lacks sufficient notice of a bankruptcy proceeding, due process considerations dictate that his or her claim cannot be discharged by a confirmation order.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">As in <em>Chemetron Corp. v. Jones, </em>\u201c[e]xcept for narrow statutory exceptions not relevant here, confirmation of the debtor\u2019s reorganization plan discharges all prior claims against the debtor.\u201d 72 F.3d at 346; <em>see also </em>11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1141(d)(1)(A); 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 524(a)(2). Flake filed his complaint with OSHA on January 29, 2003, over a year before New World Pasta\u2019s petition for bankruptcy relief. That complaint constituted a claim under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 101(5)(A), which was subsequently discharged by the terms of the reorganization plan for New World Pasta. Because his claim was discharged and he is statutorily precluded from continuing to prosecute it, we will dismiss Flake\u2019s petition for review of the ARB\u2019s decision.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b310-15\">. The case was filed under the heading <em>Flake v. United States Department of Labor, Administrative Review Board. </em>However, the Secretary of the Department of Labor is the respondent in this appeal. The ARB is the entity whose decision Flake asks us to review.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b311-8\">. The Secretary of the Department of Labor had subject matter jurisdiction over Flake\u2019s complaint based on 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1514A(b)(l)(A). The Assistant Secretary of OSHA had responsibility for receiving and investigating whistleblower complaints per Secretary\u2019s Order 5-2002; Delegation of Authority and Assignment of Responsibility to the Assistant Secretary for Occupational Safety and Health, 67 Fed.Reg. 65,008 (Oct. 22, 2002). <em>See also </em>29 C.F.R. \u00a7 \u00a7 1980.104 and 1980.105. We have jurisdiction to review the Secretary\u2019s order under 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 42121(b)(4)(A).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"A9X\">. Alternatively, even if Flake\u2019s claim was not discharged in bankruptcy, our independent review of the record reveals that the Administrative Review Board was not clearly erroneous in finding that the whistleblower provision under Section 806 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act does not apply to New World Pasta and thus does not make relief available to Flake. Because there have been fewer than 300 holders of New World Pasta registered securities since its inception, the company\u2019s duty to file reports under Section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 was automatically suspended by statute. <em>See </em>15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78o(d). Flake\u2019s arguments regarding the legislative history and public policy underlying the Sarbanes-Oxley Act are without merit, since 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 78o(d) expressly excludes closely-held companies such as New World Pasta from the Act\u2019s provisions, which are aimed at widely-held public corporations.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
