The procedural history of these cases and the details of St. Louis\u2019s claims are well-known to the parties, set forth in the District Court\u2019s orders, and need not be discussed at length. Briefly, St. Louis filed two civil rights complaints pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1988. St. Louis sued persons he believed were responsible for his conviction for rape and sexual abuse of a child. After the District Court dismissed the actions pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B), St. Louis filed timely notices of appeal and motions for the appointment of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-10\">Because St. Louis is proceeding <em>in for-ma pauperis, </em>we must analyze his appeals for possible dismissal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). Under \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B), we must dismiss an appeal if the action (i) is frivolous or malicious, (ii) fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted, or (iii) seeks monetary damages from a defendant with immunity. An action or appeal can be frivolous for either legal or factual reasons. <em>Neitzke v. Williams, </em>490 U.S. 319, 325, 109 S.Ct. 1827, 104 L.Ed.2d 338 (1989).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-13\">For substantially the reasons given by the District Court, we agree that St. Louis\u2019s claims are frivolous and malicious. St. Louis may challenge his conviction only through a habeas corpus petition, <em>see Preiser v. Rodriguez, </em>411 U.S. 475, 93 S.Ct. 1827, 36 L.Ed.2d 439 (1973), and cannot recover damages for wrongful incarceration until his conviction has been invalidated.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). Moreover, the father of his victim, the father\u2019s girlfriend, and St. Louis\u2019s public defender are not state actors, <em>see Polk County v. Dodson, </em>454 U.S. 312, 325, 102 S.Ct. 445, 70 L.Ed.2d 509 (1981), and the prosecutor has immunity. <em>See Imbler v. Pachtman, </em>424 U.S. 409, 96 S.Ct. 984, 47 L.Ed.2d 128 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-14\">In its April 24, 2007, order in <em>St. Louis v. Marshall, </em>Civ. No. 07-cv-00084, the District Court stated that St. Louis was not required to pay any previously assessed fees or the filing fee. The District Court was correct that St. Louis did not have to immediately pay the full filing fee as its March 1, 2007 order had directed. But pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(b)(1), \u201cif a prisoner brings a civil action or files an appeal in forma pauperis, the prisoner shall be required to pay the full amount of a filing fee.\u201d A prisoner <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>who is permitted to proceed <em>informa pauperis </em>must still pay the full filing fee; however, he may do so in installments. Thus, St. Louis must pay the full filing fee in installments. We note that when these proceedings are final, St. Louis will have had three actions or appeals that have been dismissed as frivolous and may no longer proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>unless he is in imminent danger of serious physical injury. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(g); <em>St. Louis v. Wilson, </em>D. Del. Civ. No. 06-cv-00682 (April 24, 2007); <em>St. Louis v. Heverin, </em>D. Del. Civ. No. 06-cv-00641 (April 24, 2007); <em>St. Louis v. Wilson, </em>D. Del. Civ. No. 05-cv-00038, 2005 WL 2217012 (Sept. 13, 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">In C.A. No. 07-2363, we will summarily affirm the District Court\u2019s order to the extent that it dismissed St. Louis\u2019s complaint as frivolous and malicious, summarily vacate the District Court\u2019s order to the extent that it relieved St. Louis of paying the filing fee, and remand the matter to the District Court to enter an order directing that the fee be collected from St. Louis\u2019s prison account in installments when funds are available. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(b)(2).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> In C.A. No. 07-2362, we will dismiss the appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915(e)(2)(B). In both appeals, St. Louis\u2019s motion for the appointment of counsel is denied.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b366-11\">. The Supreme Court of Delaware affirmed St. Louis\u2019s conviction on direct appeal and subsequently affirmed the denial of post-conviction relief. We denied St. Louis\u2019s request for a certificate of appealability to appeal the District Court\u2019s denial of his petition filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"ACp\">. We note that the District Court did not require St. Louis to pay the filing fee in <em>St. Louis v. Morris, </em>D. Del. Civ. No. 06-cv-00236 (June 29, 2006). The District Court may wish to re-examine that order as well.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
