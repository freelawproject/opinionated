After careful review of the record and Okpala\u2019s brief, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-24\">A civil complaint filed by a prisoner seeking redress from a government entity, officer or employee is screened by the district court, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A. That section provides that the court shall dismiss the complaint if it is \u201cfrivolous, malicious, or fails to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A(b)(l). We review <em>de </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"73\">*73</page-number><em>novo </em>the district court\u2019s <em>sua sponte </em>dismissal under \u00a7 1915A(b). <em>Leal v. Georgia Dept. of Corr., </em>254 F.3d 1276, 1279 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">Section 1997e of Title 42, United States Code, as amended by the Prison Litigation Reform Act (\u201cPLRA\u201d), provides the following: \u201cNo action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under section 1983 of this title, or any other Federal law, by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). Pursuant to the three-tier system of administrative remedies provided by 28 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 542.10, 542.11-542.16, and the BOP Program Statement 1330.7, in order to exhaust administrative remedies, Okpala was required first to file a written complaint with the warden on form BP-9; he then was required to appeal the Warden\u2019s decision to the BOP regional director on form BP-10; finally, Okpala was required to appeal to the BOP general counsel on form BP-11. It is undisputed that prior to filing his action in district court, Okpala had not received a decision on his form BP-11.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">On this record, the district court did not err by dismissing the complaint, pursuant to \u00a7 1915A, because Okpala\u2019s failure to exhaust administrative remedies \u2014 an affirmative defense \u2014 was clear from the face of the complaint. <em>Cf. Jones v. Bock, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 910, 920-21, 166 L.Ed.2d 798 (2007) (holding that the PLRA\u2019s exhaustion requirement is an affirmative defense, but reiterating that under \u00a7 1915A(b), the normal pleading rules remain unchanged, and thus, \u201c[wjhether a particular ground for opposing a claim may be the basis for dismissal for failure to state a claim depends on whether the allegations in the complaint suffice to establish that ground, not on the nature of the ground in the abstract.\u201d). Where, as here, an affirmative defense appears on the face of a prisoner\u2019s complaint, thereby revealing that the prisoner cannot state a claim, the PLRA continues to require a district court to dismiss the complaint. <em>Cf. id. </em>at 920-21 (noting that under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), a complaint may be dismissed if an affirmative defense, such as the statute of limitations or official immunity, appears on the face of the complaint).</p>\n<p id=\"b95-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b94-15\">. <em>See Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, </em>403 U.S. 388, 91 S.Ct. 1999, 29 L.Ed.2d 619 (1971).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b95-9\">. We are unpersuaded by Okpala\u2019s argument that his exhaustion of remedies <em>after </em>he filed this appeal mandates reversal. It is well-settled that the PLRA requires prisoners to exhaust administrative remedies <em>before </em>filing suit with respect to prison conditions. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a); <em>Alexander v. Hawk, </em>159 F.3d 1321, 1328 (11th Cir.1998); <em>see also Higginbottom v. Carter, </em>223 F.3d 1259, 1261 (11th Cir.2000) (recognizing that \u201d[t]he plain language of [\u00a7 1997e(a)] makes exhaustion a precondition to filing an action in federal court\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
