We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"AIt\">We review only the decision of the BIA, except to the extent that it expressly adopts the opinion of the IJ. <em>See Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir.2001). We review <em>de novo </em>the legal determinations of the BIA, <em>id., </em>and review factual findings of the BIA under the substantial evidence test, <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1230 (11th Cir.<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"123\">*123</page-number>2005) . \u201cUnder this highly deferential standard of review, the [BIA\u2019s] decision can be reversed only if the evidence \u2018compels\u2019 a reasonable fact finder to find otherwise.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b145-5\">Ramirez argues that he is entitled to withholding of removal, but to qualify for withholding of removal, Ramirez had to establish that it is more likely than not that he would be persecuted if returned to Colombia. <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283, 1287 (11th Cir.2003); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3). To satisfy his burden, Ramirez was required to present specific and credible evidence (1) of past persecution on account of a protected ground; or (2) that on account of a protected ground it \u201cis more likely than not\u201d he will suffer future persecution. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.16(b)(1), (2). Persecution is an \u201cextreme concept, requiring more than a few isolated incidents of verbal harassment or intimidation,\u201d and \u201cnot all exceptional treatment is persecution.\u201d <em>Zheng v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>451 F.3d 1287, 1290 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-7\">Substantial evidence supports the decision of the BIA that Ramirez failed to meet his burden of proof for at least two reasons. First, Ramirez\u2019s evidence of threats did not compel a finding that he suffered past persecution. Ramirez received threatening telephone calls from guerrillas and two unidentified men attempted to block his path in the road one evening, but Ramirez was never harmed. Ramirez also testified that guerillas demanded money and goods from his stepfather\u2019s company, which employed Ramirez, but the guerillas failed to retaliate when the company refused their demands. Second, the record supports the finding that Ramirez would not suffer persecution if returned to Colombia, because Ramirez\u2019s step-father has remained in Colombia without incident.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-8\">We lack jurisdiction to review Ramirez\u2019s remaining argument that the immigration judge denied him due process, because Ramirez did not raise this argument before the BIA. <em>Amaya-Artunduaga v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1247, 1250-51 (11th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-9\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
