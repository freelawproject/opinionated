The district court calculated an advisory Guideline range of 78-97 months\u2019 imprisonment, and sentenced Segalla to two concurrent 120-month terms of imprisonment. Segalla raises three errors that he contends combined to render his sentence unreasonable. He argues that the district court commit ted an error of law by relying on his intent to commit the \u00a7 2422(b) offense and the time frame in which he talked to the undercover officer posing as a 15-year-old girl, as these were not aggravating circumstances. Segalla also argues that the district court made a factual finding in support of its sentence that was not supported by the record and failed to consider evidence he presented in mitigation. For the reasons set forth more fully below, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b171-16\">We review the district court\u2019s factual findings at sentencing for clear error and the application of the law to the facts <em>de </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number><em>novo. United States v. Clay, </em>483 F.3d 739, 743 (11th Cir.2007). We review the final sentence for reasonableness. <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1245 (11th Cir.2005). We do not, however, apply this standard to each individual decision made during the sentencing process. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b172-4\">Unreasonableness may arise, regardless of the length of the sentence, \u201cif the district court\u2019s selection of the sentence was substantially affected by its consideration of impermissible factors.\u201d <em>United States v. Williams, </em>456 F.3d 1353, 1361 (11th Cir.2006), <em>cert. dismissed, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 3040, 168 L.Ed.2d 755 (2007). We review <em>de novo </em>whether the district court considered an impermissible factor at sentencing, as it is a question of law. <em>Id. </em>at 1361-62. When reviewing such a claim, the party challenging the sentence bears the initial burden of establishing that the court considered an impermissible factor. <em>Id. </em>at 1361. If such an error exists, and if it was preserved for appeal, we will vacate the sentence and remand, unless the party defending the sentence establishes that the error is harmless. <em>Id. </em>at 1362. In this case, Segalla objected to the length of his 120-month sentence as unreasonable, specifically contending that the court should have given more weight to his otherwise good background, work history, and lack of a significant criminal record. However, he did not contend that the district court legally erred by considering his intent or the time frame of his activities. Accordingly, we review this claim for plain error. <em>See United States v. Rodriguez, </em>398 F.3d 1291, 1298 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>545 U.S. 1127, 125 S.Ct. 2935, 162 L.Ed.2d 866 (2005). Under plain error review, there must be: (1) an error; (2) that is plain; (3) that affects substantial rights; and (4) that seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id. </em>In order for an error to be plain, it must be obvious or clear under current law. <em>United States v. Gerrow, </em>232 F.3d 831, 835 (11th Cir.2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b172-8\">One of the facts the district court considered when determining Segalla\u2019s sentence was Segalla\u2019s conversations with the undercover officer posing as a 15-year-old girl, explaining that the duration of that conduct had to be considered, and it demonstrated Segalla\u2019s intent to commit the offense in this case. The error, if any, by the district court was not plain. \u201c[Wjhere the explicit language of a statute or rule does not specifically resolve an issue, there can be no plain error where there is no precedent from the Supreme Court or this Court directly resolving it.\u201d <em>United States v. Lejarde-Rada, </em>319 F.3d 1288, 1291 (11th Cir.2003). When considering the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the court shall consider the nature and circumstances of the offense. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(1). We recently rejected the argument that the district court improperly relied upon conduct that had been taken into account in imposing a Guidelines enhancement, noting that the defendant \u201cpoints to no authority that deems it impermissible for the district court to also have considered this conduct in imposing a variance in light of the factors set forth in \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d 823, 833 (11th Cir.2007). Also, there is no precedent from the Supreme Court or this Court holding that these factors are improper or holding that factors already accounted for by the Guidelines are improper factors in a non-Guideline sentence. <em>See Clay, </em>483 F.3d at 745 (addressing religion and post-offense rehabilitation); <em>United States v. Lorenzo, </em>471 F.3d 1219, 1221 (11th Cir.2006) (addressing post-sentencing behavior); <em>United States v. Castro, </em>455 F.3d 1249, 1252-53 (11th Cir.2006) (addressing early disposition programs); <em>Williams, </em>456 F.3d at 1364-70 (addressing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>the powder and crack cocaine sentencing disparity and disagreement with the career offender enhancement).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-5\">We now turn to Segalla\u2019s remaining arguments. When evaluating the reasonableness of a sentence, we consider the factors outlined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a) and the district court\u2019s reasons for imposing the particular sentence. <em>Williams, </em>456 F.3d at 1360-61. The \u00a7 3553(a) factors take into account:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b173-6\">(1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the Sentencing Guidelines range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b173-7\"><em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 786 (11th Cir.2005) (citing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)). With respect to the final sentence, \u201cthere is a range of reasonable sentences from which the district court may choose\u201d and the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable in light of the record and the \u00a7 3553(a) factors lies with the party challenging the sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 788. \u201cWhen reviewing the length of a sentence for reasonableness, we will remand for resentencing if we are left with the definite and firm conviction that the district court committed a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>456 F.3d at 1363. \u201cThe weight to be accorded any given \u00a7 3553(a) factor is a matter committed to the sound discretion of the district court[,]\u201d and we \u201cwill not substitute our judgment in weighing the relevant factors because our review is not de novo.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation, quotation marks, and alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b173-9\">The district court listed a number of facts that it considered when imposing Segalla\u2019s sentence. It stated that one fact was Segalla\u2019s admission in chats that he met underage girls he talked to on the computer and that he previously had sex with these underage girls. The parties agree that this finding is not supported by the record. However, evidence presented at trial indicates that Segalla discussed having sex with a 13-year-old girl, whom he met on a blind date. The district court discussed a number of other facts that informed its sentence and we cannot conclude that the discrepancies between the court\u2019s statement and the record evidence as to this single fact \u201cinfected the district court\u2019s balancing of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and provides an insufficient basis for imposing a non-Guideline sentence.\u201d <em>United States v. Guidry, </em>462 F.3d 373, 377 (5th Cir.2006). Segalla also argues that there was no evidentiary support for the truthfulness of this statement, noting that what he said is not true just because he said it on the internet. However, the district court specifically referred to the fact that this was an admission by Segalla, and it was up to the district court to determine credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b173-10\">Segalla\u2019s argument that the district court failed to consider all of the mitigating evidence relating to his history and characteristics under \u00a7 3553(a)(1) is based on the following comment by the district court in response to Segalla\u2019s objection that the court should have given more weight to his otherwise good background, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>work history, and lack of a significant criminal record:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b174-4\">[A]ll of those background matters are interesting, certainly, that the court has reviewed, but I have to deal with what the defendant is presently, regardless of what caused him to be there or any seemingly mitigating matters in his past. He still came to this position in life and crimes. But they\u2019re noted for the record.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b174-5\">While this statement is somewhat vague it must be considered in context. It was made in response to Segalla\u2019s assertion that his mitigating evidence was not given enough weight. We conclude that the court was indicating that it considered this evidence, but found that it did not justify a lower sentence in light of other pertinent \u00a7 3553(a) factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-6\">Thus, Segalla has failed to establish that the resulting sentence was unreasonable. <em>Cf. Amedeo, </em>487 F.3d at 833 (rejecting an argument that the district court did not consider certain mitigating evidence based on the court\u2019s failure to mention the evidence and then stating, \u201cMore important, Amedeo has not persuaded us that the resulting sentence was unreasonable in light of the particularly egregious circumstances of this case and the limited mitigating value of the evidence he presented.\u201d). In addition to considering Segalla\u2019s admission regarding having sex with underage girls, the district court discussed a number of other facts it considered when imposing Segalla\u2019s sentence, all relating to the extent of Segalla\u2019s activities and his attempts to dispose of evidence of his criminal conduct. The court also discussed a number of the pertinent \u00a7 3553(a) factors and found that Segalla posed a physical danger to the community at large as he was likely to engage in similar conduct. Upon consideration of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court\u2019s reasons for imposing the sentence, and the extent of Segalla\u2019s conduct, both in terms of his activities on the computer and his attempts to destroy evidence of such activities, we cannot conclude that the district court \u201ccommitted a clear error of judgment in weighing the \u00a7 3553(a) factors by arriving at a sentence that lies outside the range of reasonable sentences dictated by the facts of the case.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>456 F.3d at 1363.</p>\n<p id=\"b174-8\">In light of the foregoing, Segalla\u2019s sentence is</p>\n<p id=\"b174-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
