Cruz asserts the district court erred by sentencing him to additional imprisonment and supervised release because he already had served the three-year statutory maximum term of imprisonment under \u00a7 3583(e)(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-20\">We review <em>de novo </em>the legality of a sentence, including a sentence imposed pursuant to revocation of a term of supervised release. <em>United States v. Mitsven, </em>452 F.3d 1264, 1265-66 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 127 S.Ct. 663, 166 L.Ed.2d 521 (2006). Because Cruz committed the underlying offense of conviction (a Class B felony) in 1997, the 1997 version of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583 applies. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>425 F.3d 987, 988 n. 1 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-23\">Section 3583 empowers a sentencing court to include a term of supervised release as part of a sentence. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(a) (1997). If a defendant violates the conditions of his supervised release, \u00a7 3583(e)(3) permits a district court to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b98-24\">revoke [the] term of supervised release, and require the defendant to serve in prison all or part of the term of supervised release authorized by statute for the offense that resulted in such term of supervised release without credit for time previously served on postrelease supervision, if the court ... finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant violated a condition of supervised release, except that a defendant whose term is re-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>yoked under this paragraph may not be required to serve ... more than 3 years in prison if such offense is a Class B felony....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(e)(3) (1997). The three-year statutory maximum in this section applies to the aggregate of all prison sentences imposed on multiple revocations of supervised release. <em>Williams, </em>425 F.3d at 989 (construing the same version of \u00a7 3583(e)(3)). Thus, although the district court can revoke supervised release any number of times, it may not impose a sentence of imprisonment following any revocation that, when added with all previous sentences of imprisonment following revocation, would exceed the maximum provided under \u00a7 3583(e)(3). <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">Additionally, when the district court revokes a term of supervised release, and imposes a term of imprisonment that is less than the maximum permitted under \u00a7 3583(e), the district court may:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOy\">include a requirement that the defendant be placed on a term of supervised release after imprisonment. The length of such a term of supervised release shall not exceed the term of supervised release authorized by statute for the offense that resulted in the original term of supervised release, less any term of imprisonment that was imposed upon revocation of supervised release.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(h) (1997). For a Class B felony, the statutory maximum term of supervised release is \u201cnot more than five years,\u201d unless otherwise provided. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(b)(1) (1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b99-8\">The district court did not err in imposing a term of 6 months\u2019 imprisonment and 35 months of supervised release following Cruz\u2019s third revocation of supervised release. The 6-month imprisonment term, when added to Cruz\u2019s previous sentences of imprisonment following revocation, does not exceed the 3-year maximum provided under \u00a7 3583(e)(3) for a Class B felony. Additionally, the 35-month supervised release term does not exceed the 5-year maximum provided under \u00a7 3583(b)(1), less \u201cany term of imprisonment ... imposed [on Cruz] upon revocation of supervised release.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(h) (1997). We therefore affirm the district court\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
