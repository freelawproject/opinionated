At the time, Carruthers was covered under an automobile insurance policy issued by GEICO General Insurance Company. Pursuant to Florida's Motor Vehicle No-Fault Law, the policy provided him with $ 10,000 in personal injury protection (PIP) benefits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20627.736\">\n    Fla.

To be entitled to the full $ 10,000, however, the statute required that Carruthers-like all PIP beneficiaries-be diagnosed by an authorized health care provider with an \"emergency medical condition\" (EMC ); without such a diagnosis, he was limited to $ 2,500 in benefits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Fla.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%20627.736\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at \u00a7 627.736(1)(a)(3) - (4) ;\n   <em>\n    Robbins v.

It is also undisputed that, despite the lack of an EMC finding, GEICO paid Carruthers/Gerber $ 7,311 in PIP benefits pre-suit, well in excess of the $ 2,500 cap. Even though Carruthers received almost triple the amount in PIP benefits that he was entitled to, Gerber believed that GEICO had misinterpreted certain language in its automobile policies and that this misinterpretation resulted in GEICO consistently underpaying PIP benefits as a \"general business practice.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Specifically, the policy contains an endorsement identified as FLPIP (01-13), and that endorsement (under the heading \"PAYMENTS WE WILL MAKE\") references fee schedules pursuant to which GEICO will pay 80% of benefits that are medically necessary. The endorsement goes on to state: \"For all other medical services, supplies, and care [GEICO will pay] 200 percent of the allowable amount under [a Medicare Part B fee schedule],\" subject to a limitation of 80% of the \"maximum reimbursable allowance under workers' compensation ....\" Below that statement, GEICO added the following: \"A charge submitted by a provider, for an amount less than the amount allowed above, shall be paid in the amount of the charge submitted.\" The underlying dispute in this case hinges on whether this single sentence is the operative language of the policy for health care provider bills of less than 200% of the fee schedule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   GEICO has taken the position that the policy is an \"80/20 policy\" pursuant to which it was required to pay the lower of 80% of the fee schedule amount or 80% of the charged amount, while insureds are required to pay the remaining 20% as co-insurance. To supports its position, GEICO relied,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , on a document mailed or provided to its PIP policyholders effective on or after January 1, 2013, and identified as M608 (01-13). This document was titled\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   <em>\n    IMPORTANT NOTICE\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   FEE SCHEDULE ENDORSEMENT\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   and it provides in relevant part that \"in no event will the Company pay more than 80 percent\" of properly billed medical expenses. GEICO asserts that M608 (01-13) is an endorsement and, thus, part of the policy. Gerber has argued that M608 (01-13) is not an endorsement/part of the policy, and it further argues that FLPIP (01-13)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   provides that when a health care provider bills for services at an amount less than 200% of the fee schedule, GEICO must pay the charge\n   <em>\n    as billed\n   </em>\n   (that is, \"in the amount of the charge submitted\") without the 20% reduction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Carruthers assigned his rights to his treating chiropractic clinic, Gerber, which later filed a declaratory judgment class action suit in Florida state court in September 2016. The complaint sought certification of a class (with Gerber as the class representative) along with a declaration (a) that GEICO's interpretation of its policy language was wrong, and (b) that the misinterpretation \"constitutes a breach of the insurance Policy.\" Although the complaint sought a declaration that GEICO had breached the policy, the complaint stated that \"there is no claim for monetary relief\" in the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   GEICO removed the case to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida in November 2016, pursuant to the Class Action Fairness Act, and Gerber filed an unsuccessful motion to remand the case for lack of Article III standing. The District Court appointed Gerber as class representative, and it certified the class to include:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   All health care providers that received an assignment of benefits from a claimant and thereafter, pursuant to that assignment, submitted claims for no-fault benefits under GEICO PIP policies to which Endorsement FLPIP (01-13) applies, and any subsequent policies with substantially similar language that were in effect since January 1, 2013, where GEICO utilized the Code BA [billed amount] with respect to the payment of any claims.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Shortly after the action was removed to federal court, and while its motion to remand was pending, Gerber filed an amended complaint. The amended complaint was largely the same as the original complaint, but it added another sentence to re-emphasize that \"this action does not assert a claim for any monetary relief,\" and it deleted the request for a declaration that GEICO's misinterpretation of the disputed policy language \"constitutes a breach of the insurance Policy.\" Thus, as amended, the complaint clarified that it only sought declaratory relief and that there was no claim for breach of contract or request for money damages related thereto. In July 2017-more than two years after the underlying car accident, and ten months after the litigation was filed-Carruthers obtained an EMC medical diagnosis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   On cross motions for summary judgment, GEICO argued,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that Gerber lacked standing at the outset of the lawsuit because it was undisputed that GEICO had paid Gerber more than $ 2,500 before the case was filed, even though he had not been diagnosed with an EMC at that time. By order dated November 17, 2017, the District Court disagreed with GEICO and found there was standing. It also ruled that M608 (01-13) was not an endorsement (but rather was merely a notice) and, thus, it was not part of the policy. Applying a textual interpretation of the FLPIP (01-13) endorsement, the District Court granted summary judgment for Gerber and held that, \"under the disputed provision, when a health care provider bills for covered services in an amount less than 200% of the fee schedule, GEICO is required to pay the charge as billed without any reduction.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   GEICO now appeals, arguing that Gerber lacked standing to bring this case. It further argues that the District Court erred in certifying the class; in limiting the documents that comprise the policy (that is, in failing to treat M608 (01-13) as an endorsement); and in ruling for Gerber on\n   the merits as to the policy interpretation question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We must begin with the question of standing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kondrat'yev v.

Based on that case, the District Court held that GEICO's pre-suit (and pre-EMC) payment in excess of the statutory cap didn't implicate standing, but, rather, it was an exhaustion of benefits affirmative defense. The District Court's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Mills\n   </em>\n   was misplaced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The plaintiffs in that case, Dale and Diane Mills, owned a mobile home that was insured under a policy issued by the defendant, Foremost Insurance Company. They filed a class action alleging that Foremost had failed to pay them (and other insureds) for overhead, profit, and taxes after they sustained hurricane-damaged losses, and they sought compensation for those \"Withheld Payments.\" Notably-and in contrast to this action-the plaintiffs in\n   <em>\n    Mills\n   </em>\n   were seeking both declaratory relief\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   damages for breach of contract. The defendant argued that the plaintiffs had failed to satisfy certain preconditions in the policy that allegedly required them to complete repair or replacement of their damaged property first and then submit a repair or replacement cost claim to the insurance company before entitling them to the Withheld Payments. Foremost argued that the Millses' failure to do so deprived them of standing, and the District Court agreed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   In reversing, we began by holding the District Court erred in interpreting the policy to require that the Millses jump through the aforementioned hoops.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4068482\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/511/1300/\">\n    511 F.3d at 1304-06\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (rejecting the district court's conclusion that preconditions in the policy required the Millses to complete repair or replacement of their damaged property and to submit such a replacement cost claim to be entitled to the Withheld Payments). We then continued:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   The district court also erred in treating these particular insurance coverage issues under the Policy as standing issues. The complaint alleges that the Millses had a mobile home, that Foremost issued an insurance policy covering hurricane damage to the mobile home, that a hurricane damaged the Millses' mobile home, that the Millses made a claim under the Policy for those damages,\n   <em>\n    and that Foremost paid less on the claim than the Millses contend they are owed. Thus, the Millses clearly had standing to sue for damages under the Policy. See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wooden v.

Whether the Millses' complaint pled sufficient facts is likewise a failure-to-state-a-claim issue. We thus reject Foremost's standing arguments as to the Millses' individual claims against Foremost on this basis as well.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11111676\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/247/1262/#p1273\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11111676\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/247/1262/#p1273\">\n    at 1306-07\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Therefore,\n   <em>\n    Mills\n   </em>\n   was not (as here) an exhaustion of benefits case.

This distinction is critical because if the plaintiffs had prevailed in\n   <em>\n    Mills,\n   </em>\n   they would have been entitled to the Withheld Payments. Thus, we found there that \"the Millses clearly had standing to sue\n   <em>\n    for damages\n   </em>\n   under the Policy\" because the plaintiffs alleged that the insurer \"paid [them] less on the claim than [they] contend they are owed,\" and a ruling in their favor on that point would entitle them to the money owed.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4068482\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/511/1300/\">\n    511 F.3d at 1307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

It doesn't have to seek such relief. As earlier noted, however, when a plaintiff\n   is seeking declaratory relief without a claim for money damages for injuries already suffered, the plaintiff must allege facts from which it appears that there is a substantial likelihood that he will suffer injury in the future.\n   <em>\n    E.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   , 772 F.3d at 883. Gerber has not alleged such facts here. Quite to the contrary, a review of Gerber's motion to remand indicates that it specifically tailored its complaint to\n   <em>\n    avoid\n   </em>\n   alleging future injury (as it did with the money damages). Indeed, Gerber unequivocally stated in its motion that \"\n   <em>\n    Plaintiff does not make any claim in the complaint that there is a risk of future injury.\n   </em>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Remand Mot. at 9 (emphasis added).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Gerber now argues-directly contrary to what it previously argued-that there\n   <em>\n    is\n   </em>\n   a risk of future injury here. Specifically, Gerber argues that the dispute about the policy language will continue or be repeated in the future, and it will injure Gerber and other chiropractors insofar as they don't know whether to tell their patients that GEICO is responsible for the full 100% of the relevant charges, or whether the patients are responsible for 20%.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Oral Argument 19:16-20:23. This is significant, Gerber's counsel noted during oral argument, as evidenced by the fact that GEICO had indirectly accused Gerber of insurance fraud in this case for not attempting to collect the 20% from Carruthers, and such accusations could adversely impact its license in the future.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 19:10-20:13.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Whether and to what extent Gerber might be injured is beside the point because the proper inquiry in this case must focus on the potential future injury to\n   <em>\n    Carruthers\n   </em>\n   , not to Gerber or other members of the class.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kostelac v.

I find that analysis irrelevant given that Gerber seeks only declaratory relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   The oddness of this case calls for special emphasis. Gerber has deployed a variety of tactics that make it hard to believe a case like this one will ever arise again. In particular, Gerber vigorously argued in the district court that it lacked Article III standing, and in doing so it expressly disclaimed any interest in future relief. Nevertheless, Gerber decided to avoid the rigors of Rule 23(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and to move to certify a class only under Rule 23(b)(2) -a rule intended, in part, to confer the prospective relief Gerber had disclaimed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   With these things in mind, I agree with the panel that Gerber-and by extension Carruthers\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   -lacks standing. But I agree only with the panel's analysis that concludes that Gerber and Carruthers lack an interest in future relief. I believe that analysis is dispositive on its own.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Gerber and Carruthers seek only a declaration that the PIP requires GEICO to pay 100% of certain charges rather than 80%. The only thing that matters, then, is whether Gerber and Carruthers have an interest in any future relief conferred by the declaration they seek.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Malowney v. Fed.

Yet the panel believes that it matters whether Gerber and Carruthers were paid beyond the PIP limit. The panel reasons that if Gerber and Carruthers have exhausted their benefits, they have not suffered an injury and will not benefit from a favorable declaration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   The problem is that, contrary to GEICO's and the panel's assertion, this case is not about exhaustion of benefits. Again, Gerber's operative complaint seeks only a declaratory judgment regarding how GEICO should pay certain charges. Yet Gerber has disclaimed the notion that GEICO will underpay it in the future.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Doc. 7 at 7-9; Doc. 40 at 4. That disclaimer, not any money GEICO has paid Gerber in the past, is why Gerber lacks standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In short, it does not matter how much money Gerber and Carruthers have been paid. For that reason, the panel's discussion of mootness is also irrelevant. GEICO could not buy its way out of this declaratory judgment action-before or after the action began. A declaratory judgment lawsuit requires the plaintiff to prove a substantial likelihood of future harm. Gerber has disclaimed any such harm. The panel and I agree on this point.

To hold otherwise would mean that if GEICO had denied PIP benefits pre-suit but then paid Gerber $ 7,311 shortly after the case was filed, the case would have become moot and thus non-justiciable, but undisputed evidence showing that those same benefits were paid before the case was filed wouldn't raise any justiciability concerns.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-68\">\n    In her concurring opinion, Judge Branch believes it is irrelevant that GEICO paid in excess of the PIP limit because Gerber is not seeking money damages.

Consistent with the foregoing, counsel for Gerber expressly said at oral argument that if their interpretation of GEICO's policy is correct and Gerber prevails in this lawsuit, the \"monetary claims ... will come\" later. Oral Argument 20:30-20:35. We understand this argument (that there are viable claims for damages that will be raised in the future) to potentially implicate the standing issue. If Gerber were to win on the merits, monetary claims may indeed come later (and there may be standing) for class members who were underpaid as the result of GEICO's misinterpretation of its policy language. However, it is undisputed that when the complaint was filed (the only time that matters) Carruthers (the only person who matters) was paid more in PIP benefits than he was entitled to.\n    <em>\n     See, e.g.,\n    </em>\n    Appellee Brief at 29 (acknowledging that GEICO \"voluntarily pa[id] Gerber $ 7,311 with no EMC determination when Gerber made its insurance claims\"). Thus, there is no monetary claim for Gerber as Carruthers' assignee, and there will be no such claim in the future for Carruthers-even though he was diagnosed with an EMC\n    <em>\n     after\n    </em>\n    this case was filed-because standing must be determined as of the time of filing.
