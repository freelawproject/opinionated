App'x 617\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 620 (9th Cir. 2016). When the case returned to the district court, USFS filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. USFS maintains that it is not subject to suit in this case because RCRA only governs parties that actively contribute to the disposal of solid waste. Two groups of intervenors (\"Intervenors\") filed separate motions presenting additional arguments as to why USFS cannot be sued under the statute with respect to the use of lead ammunition in the Kaibab. Rather than addressing these arguments, the district court held that the Center was requesting an improper advisory opinion and dismissed the lawsuit on justiciability grounds. The Center appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    A.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Kaibab is both home to a variety of wildlife species, including several species of avian predators, and a favorite site for big-game hunting. Some hunters in the Kaibab use lead ammunition, and some of them leave behind the remains of their kill, either because they prefer not to \"pack out\" the remains or because the hunted animal runs away after it is shot and then dies elsewhere. Other animals feed on those remains and ingest fragments of spent lead ammunition. Lead ingestion, even in small amounts, can cause significant adverse effects on animals' health, including death. Because of such health consequences, the federal government has banned the use of lead bullets for waterfowl hunting nationwide since 1991.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2020.108\">\n    50 C.F.R. \u00a7 20.108\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Migratory Bird Hunting: Nationwide Requirement to Use Nontoxic Shot for the Taking of Waterfowl, Coots, and Certain Other Species Beginning in the 1991-92 Hunting Season,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=56%20Fed.%20Reg.%2022%2C100\">\n    56 Fed.

Because condors rely on animal carcasses as a primary food source, the Complaint alleges, \"[l]ead poisoning has been and continues to be the leading cause of condor mortality in Arizona,\" and \"[s]pent lead ammunition has been and continues to be the primary source of the condors' lead exposure in Arizona.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Despite its authority to do so,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   USFS does not regulate hunting in the Kaibab outside certain narrow restrictions, and does not regulate the use of lead ammunition in the Kaibab at all.

USFS does require that any commercial entities operating in the Kaibab, including hunting outfitters, obtain \"special use\" permits, but those permits do not regulate the hunting itself. Instead, USFS defers to Arizona's hunting regulations, which govern National Forest System lands in Arizona.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ariz.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20%C2%A7%2017-234\">\n    Ariz.

In RCRA, Congress expressly authorized private suits such as this one and set forth specific conditions for the exercise of judicial authority in such suits. To the extent the exercise of that authority \"intrudes\"-to use the district court's term-on the exercise of USFS's discretion, it does so because that discretion is subject to the limits enunciated by Congress, and because Congress has sanctioned judicial \"intrusion\" if those limits are exceeded. Typically, we call that \"intrusion\" judicial review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   USFS does not defend the district court's holding that the Center is seeking an advisory opinion. Instead, USFS recasts the district court's ruling and then defends its version of what the court meant: USFS maintains first that \"[t]he district court's decision is better construed as declining jurisdiction based on equitable factors, including deference to the policy choices of the other branches of the federal government.\" USFS then goes on to argue that the district court had discretion to decline jurisdiction over the case because the Center is seeking equitable relief. There are two fatal flaws in this position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   <strong>\n    1.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The district court's opinion cannot plausibly be read as anything other than a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction. Although the court stated in its order that a federal court has discretion over whether to issue a declaratory judgment under the Declaratory Judgment Act, it did not suggest that it had similar discretion to decline to exercise jurisdiction over a request for the injunctive relief expressly authorized by Congress in RCRA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The district court declared at the outset that \"a federal court first must be satisfied that the lawsuit passes\n   <em>\n    constitutional muster\n   </em>\n   and fulfills statutory jurisdictional prerequisites before it exercises its [declaratory judgment] discretion\" (emphasis in original). The court then explained that because \"there [was] no real and substantial controversy\" before it, \"the relief requested by Plaintiffs would necessarily take the form of an advisory opinion.\" The court's subsequent analysis rested entirely on the jurisdictional concerns surrounding advisory opinions. There was no discussion of whether the court might have discretion to decline jurisdiction over the Center's request for equitable relief\n   <em>\n    if\n   </em>\n   there were jurisdiction over the case. The district court concluded its analysis by reiterating that \"[w]ithout jurisdiction the court cannot proceed at all in any case.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   The district court's order dismissing this case was based squarely on its determination that the district lacked jurisdiction. It was not based on any exercise of discretion to decline jurisdiction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In any event, the district court could not properly have exercised discretion to decline jurisdiction over the case. Federal courts have a \"virtually unflagging obligation ... to exercise the jurisdiction given them.\"\n   <em>\n    Colo. River Water Conservation Dist. v.
