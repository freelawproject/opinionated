In 2016, EPA adopted a rule, Revisions to Ambient Monitoring Quality Assurance and Other Requirements,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=81%20Fed.%20Reg.%2017%2C248\">\n    81 Fed. Reg. 17,248\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Mar. 28, 2016) (\"Final Rule\"), modifying its regulations on the subject, specifically Part 58 of Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations. The amendments (1) tightened procedures for state changes to annual monitoring network plans, (2) authorized limited reductions in required sampling frequency, and (3) proposed revisions to certain quality assurance requirements related to monitoring for Prevention of Significant Deterioration.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Sierra Club raises three objections. Resting on EPA's language in the preamble to the rule, it attacks the divergence between EPA's procedures for reviewing SIPs and annual monitoring network plans-a divergence embodied in a 2006 EPA regulation that has long since passed the deadline for seeking judicial review. It challenges (on the merits) the new authority on sampling frequency reductions. And it sees a fatal procedural defect in the quality assurance adjustments in the form of EPA's statement-plainly and concededly mistaken-that no commenter had criticized the changes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the reasons below, however, we find that Sierra Club (1) is barred from seeking review of the claimed legal requirement that monitoring plans be assessed under the same procedures as SIPs because the new rule and EPA's preamble did no more than echo a prior EPA regulation, (2) lacks standing to attack the sampling frequency changes, and (3) has made no showing that the asserted non-response on quality assurance issues manifested any failure to consider factors relevant to the changes. Thus we dismiss the first two claims and deny the third.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The Clean Air Act,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%207401\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7401\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 7671q, establishes a comprehensive system for regulating and improving the nation's air quality, divvying up responsibility between the federal government and the states.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   First, EPA identifies air pollutants that endanger public health or welfare, and sets National Ambient Air Quality Standards, or NAAQS, that specify the maximum permissible concentration of those pollutants in the ambient air.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%207408\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7408\n   </extracted-citation>\n   - 09.

Sierra Club Br. 24.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   But no later than 2006 EPA's regulations pursued the non-SIP path.

Accordingly (absent EPA's reopening the issue), Sierra Club's time for challenging EPA's adoption of a non-SIP approach to reviewing annual monitoring network plans has passed. And because the issue is jurisdictional,\n   <em>\n    Sierra Club v.

Cir. 2011).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   EPA's decision to place annual monitoring network plans outside the SIP-review process was evident. For example, while the statute requires\n   <em>\n    EPA\n   </em>\n   approval of\n   <em>\n    SIP revisions\n   </em>\n   to be preceded by notice and an opportunity for comment, see\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207607\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1)(B), (3), (4)(B)(i), (5), (6)(B) ; see also Sierra Club Br. 8, the 2006 rulemaking provided that, for certain\n   <em>\n    monitoring plans\n   </em>\n   , \"the Regional Administrator is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   required to provide a separate opportunity for comment,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2058.10\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 58.10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2) (2007) (emphasis added); see also\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=71%20Fed.%20Reg.%2061%2C236\">\n    71 Fed. Reg. at 61\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,248/1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The 2006 rulemaking also embodied the same disconnect between\n   <em>\n    state\n   </em>\n   processes for formulating monitoring plans and for formulating SIPs-at least under Sierra Club's reading of the statute. Sierra Club complains that the current provision on the subject is unlawful because it diverges from the statutory requirement applicable to SIP submissions-namely, that states act only after providing \"reasonable notice and public hearings,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%207410\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7410\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1), (a)(2), (\n   <em>\n    l\n   </em>\n   ). See Sierra Club Br. 37. But EPA created that divergence no later than the 2006 rulemaking, which similarly fell short of that standard, demanding only that a monitoring \"plan must be made available for public inspection.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2058.10\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 58.10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(1) (2007).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Thus, by at least 2006 EPA had necessarily concluded that annual monitoring network plans were\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   components of a SIP.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In the rulemaking currently under review EPA simply continued the same approach. In 2014 it proposed two modest revisions to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2058.10\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 58.10\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

Reg. 54,356\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 54,359/1-2 (Sept. 11, 2014) (\"Proposed Rule\"). The proposal gave no indication that EPA intended to address the relationship between annual monitoring network plans and SIPs, or the requirements applicable to SIPs, which are addressed (in great detail) elsewhere, see 40 C.F.R. pt. 51 (concerning the \"Requirements for Preparation, Adoption, and Submittal of [SIPs]\"). In proposing and adopting these tweaks, EPA never purported to close the gap in review procedures between the two types of plans. Rather, it maintained (with slight edits) the non-SIP approach it adopted, at the latest, in 2006.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Accordingly, if Sierra Club disagreed with EPA's disjuncture between monitoring plans and SIPs, it should have raised\n   its objection at the conclusion of the 2006 rulemaking, \"within sixty days of EPA's first use of the [non-SIP-style] approach.\"\n   <em>\n    Medical Waste Inst.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5650634,3556910\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/645/420/\">\n    645 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   427 ; see also, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Am.

See Earthjustice &amp; American Lung Association Comments, EPA-HQ-OAR-2013-0619-0034, at 2 (Nov. 10, 2014) (\"Earthjustice Comments\"), J.A. 96.

In sum, EPA's rejection of Sierra Club's extraneous comment did not give Sierra Club the right to challenge longstanding aspects of EPA's regulations that the agency did not open for reconsideration. (We take no position on the merits of Sierra Club's view that monitoring plans are a subset of SIPs, nor on whether Sierra Club may challenge EPA's refusal to adopt SIP-style-review procedures in another context, such as in a petition for rulemaking.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Sierra Club next challenges EPA's decision to permit Regional Administrators to give case-by-case approval to reductions in the minimum required sampling frequency of monitoring for fine particulate matter. Known as PM2.5, fine particulate matter consists of airborne particles that are 2.5 micrometers in diameter or smaller-less than one-thirtieth the thickness of human hair.

On this, there is no immediate change.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Rather, EPA's revisions created the possibility of exceptions-enabling possible reductions from 1-in-3 days to 1-in-6 days (or for seasonal sampling). EPA sought to\n   address the sort of situation where a particular monitor was \"highly unlikely\" to record an otherwise undetected violation of the PM2.5 NAAQS.

One example it noted was a monitor located in an area with \"very low PM2.5 concentrations relative to the NAAQS.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Another was a monitor in an urban environment surrounded by a superabundance of other monitors, all with higher readings.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . Accordingly, EPA reasoned that in such instances the 1-in-3 sampling frequency might be unnecessary.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   To counteract the possibility of excessive redundancy, EPA gave Regional Administrators a cautiously hedged authority to approve state requests to reduce specific monitors' sampling frequency to 1-in-6 days or to seasonal sampling.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=40%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%2058.12\">\n    40 C.F.R. \u00a7 58.12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(1)(ii) (2018).
