By its very terms, the statute never requires signatures from more than 1% of these voters. However, by choice, the Libertarian Party has barred non-members from voting in its primary-under party policy, only members can vote in the primary. And it does not want its candidates to solicit signatures from non-members; as a consequence, Libertarian candidates must submit signatures equal to 11% to 30% of party membership in their jurisdiction to qualify for the primary ballot. Thus, our dilemma: is the \"significant modicum of support\" measured against all voters eligible under state law to sign a nominating petition and participate in the primary?

There was no adjustment to account for the significant portion of this pool comprised of registered members of other parties, many of whom, it can be reasonably presumed, were unlikely to help nominate a competing candidate or party. Nor was there any suggestion that a candidate should be limited to seeking signatures from voters who have already pledged their support to the candidate or his party or cause.

And we do so again here. Arizona law permits all qualified signers- Libertarian Party members, new party members, and registered unaffiliated voters-to sign a Libertarian candidate's nominating petition and to vote in the Libertarian primary. However, qualified signers who already signed another candidate's nominating petition are excluded from the \"available pool\" of voters able to sign a Libertarian candidate's petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   No evidence suggests that, in practice, the statute's (at most) 1% signature requirement even approaches 5% of this remaining pool of eligible signers. It falls upon the Libertarian Party to demonstrate that Arizona imposes a severe burden, and it has failed to do so here. The party's policy choice to exclude all non-members from its primary and its preference to obtain signatures only from party members do not change the calculus. To hold otherwise would permit a party to determine the number of signatures required by manipulating its nominating petition and primary voting requirements. At the same time, the Libertarian Party's proposed rule would incentivize parties to have fewer registered members and therefore artificially reduce the signature requirements. Just as important: where, in this scheme, is the offensive state action? There is no question that the signature requirement would be constitutional if the Libertarian Party permitted non-members to vote in its primary. A political party cannot manipulate its internal preferences and processes to transform a constitutional statute into an unconstitutional one.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Crucially, Arizona law does not impose any other requirements, such as a strict time period for signature collection, that might nonetheless render the 1% requirement \"an impossible burden\" or \"an impractical undertaking.\"\n   <em>\n    Storer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6180873\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/415/724/#p729\">\n    415 U.S. at 740\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6180873\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/415/724/#p729\">\n    94 S.Ct. 1274\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (requiring 1,000 canvassers to collect 14 signatures each day for 24 days likely imposes a modest burden);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Clingman\n   </em>\n   , 544 U.S. at 589-90,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5872036\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/544/581/\">\n    125 S.Ct. 2029\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (limiting a party's internal structure, decision-making processes, and ability to communicate with the electorate likely imposes a severe burden);\n   <em>\n    Timmons\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11651911\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/351/#p358\">\n    520 U.S. at 363\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11651911\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/520/351/#p358\">\n    117 S.Ct. 1364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (same);\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200638\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/460/780/\">\n    460 U.S. at 790-94\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6200638\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/460/780/\">\n    103 S.Ct. 1564\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (requiring an independent candidate to file several months before party conventions imposes severe burden);\n   <em>\n    Am.

But we face no such situation here. Libertarian candidates can qualify for the primary ballot with signatures from 11% to 30% of party members in their jurisdictions, and no evidence suggests it is impossible to do so as a practical matter.
