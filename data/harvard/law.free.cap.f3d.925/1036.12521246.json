Penal Code \u00a7 4573.6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007). The government argues that the statute is divisible because it criminalizes possession in prison of \"any controlled substances,\" so the question of which individual controlled substance is involved is necessarily an element of the offense. We conclude that the statute is not divisible based on the plain text, state court decisions, and the contrast to convictions under the California Health and Safety Code.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   First, the plain language of the statute suggests that the type of controlled substance is merely a means of satisfying the controlled substance element. Although not dispositive, there are no disjunctive lists in the statute.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Almanza-Arenas v.

The only potentially divisible element of the statute is the type of controlled substance, and the statute refers to \"any controlled\n   <em>\n    substances\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%204573.6\">\n    Cal. Pen. Code \u00a7 4573.6\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (emphasis added). In contrast, statutes in the California Health and Safety Code prohibit possession of \"any controlled\n   <em>\n    substance\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Cal.%20Code%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2011350\">\n    Cal.

This suggests that contemporaneous possession of multiple controlled\n   <em>\n    substances\n   </em>\n   is only a single crime under section 4573.6, and the type of controlled substance is merely a means and not a list of alternative elements.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mathis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598042\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2243/#p2248\">\n    136 S.
