He testified generally that quantity and packaging indicate whether drugs are intended for personal use or trafficking. He opined that in this case, the cocaine was \"individually packaged for sale,\" the ecstacy pills were intended for sale, and the marijuana \"well exceeds what anybody would possess for the purpose of use.\" He also testified generally: (1) \"drug scales, other packaging, firearms, U.S. currency, [and] cell phones\" are \"tools of the trade\" for \"drug distribution;\" (2) dealers often package drugs in \"ready-for-sale\" baggies; (3) dealers use firearms to protect their drugs and money; and (4) dealers often use borrowed vehicles and aliases to avoid law enforcement detection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   McDaniel asserts the court improperly relied on Detective Stanze's testimony because it lacked \"scientific method.\" But Federal Rule of Evidence 702 does not require this. Rather, it allows testimony from \"[a] witness who is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education\" if \"the expert's scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.\"\n   <strong>\n    Fed.
