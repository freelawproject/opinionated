Fiesta alleges that Sanctuary copied its fabric design, which was used to manufacture a blouse that was sold by the defendant retail outlets. Sanctuary filed a counterclaim, seeking invalidation of Fiesta's copyright. Concluding that Fiesta's copyright registration was invalid, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of Defendants. The district court determined invalidity pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=17%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20411\">\n    17 U.S.C. \u00a7 411\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b), finding that Fiesta knowingly included inaccurate information in its copyright application that would have caused the Copyright Office to deny registration. Recognizing that a valid copyright registration is a prerequisite to bringing suit, the district court dismissed Fiesta's complaint. The court also awarded attorney's fees and costs to Defendants. Fiesta appeals the final judgment as of right. Finding no error in the conclusions of the district court, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <em>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Fiesta is a California corporation that creates textile designs and sells fabric to its customers, who use the fabric to make clothing. Sanctuary is a clothing manufacturer; the remaining defendants are retailers who purchased garments from Sanctuary and sold them to customers. Fiesta alleges that it owns the copyright in a two-dimensional textile design entitled 1461-43 (\"1461 Design\"). According to Fiesta, Sanctuary infringed its copyright by creating and selling clothing to retailers featuring a design substantially similar to the 1461 Design.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Effective October 24, 2013, Fiesta registered the 1461 Design under Copyright Registration No. VAu 1-151-509 (\" '509 Registration\"), as part of its \"Grp. 029-Spring/Summer 2014\" collection. In addition to the 1461 Design, the '509 Registration comprises thirty-three fabric designs. In the copyright application, Fiesta's president, Morris Ajnassian, certified that none of the works in the collection had been published as of October 23, 2013. The fabric designs were registered as an unpublished collection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Prior to the registration, Fiesta sold samples of fabric bearing the 1461 Design to \"a limited group of existing and potential customers for the limited purpose of securing full production contracts for hundreds or thousands of yards of fabric.\" Between March 12, 2013, and October 24, 2013, Fiesta sold about 190 yards of fabric featuring the 1461 Design. Ajnassian testified that he knew that sample fabric bearing the 1461 Design had been sold prior to\n   approving the copyright registration application, but that he did not consider sampling to be publication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <em>\n    PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In ruling on the parties' cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court determined that because the 1461 Design had been sold prior to registration, it had been published and, therefore, Fiesta's identification of the 1461 Design as unpublished in the copyright application was inaccurate. Because Fiesta knew that the fabric had previously been sold, the court concluded, it included inaccurate information in its copyright application with knowledge that it was inaccurate. The court deferred a final ruling on whether Fiesta's copyright registration was invalid, and submitted an inquiry to the Copyright Office regarding whether the Register of Copyrights would have rejected Fiesta's application if it had known of the inaccuracy. Specifically, the district court inquired as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   Would the Register of Copyrights have rejected Plaintiff's Registration No. VAu 1-151-509 for 2-dimensional artwork (\"Grp. 029-Spring/Summer 2014,\" filed October 24, 2013) with respect to Design 1461? Thus, would it have done so if, at the time of the application, the Register of Copyrights had known that, although Plaintiff had characterized the work as an unpublished collection that included the 1461 Design, Plaintiff previously had published the 1461 Design when it sold to its customers fabric samples that used the 1461 Design, without limiting further distribution or sale by those customers?\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Register of Copyrights responded that \"had the Office been aware that the 1461 Design had been previously published, the Office would have refused registration of that work using the unpublished collections option because the work was registered as unpublished when in fact it had been published.\" As the district court explained, \"[t]he Register noted that if it is made aware of an error at the time of application, the general practice of the Copyright Office is to correspond with the applicant and give an opportunity to correct the error\" within forty-five days. The Register's response was \"premised on the fact that the error identified in the Court's question was not timely corrected.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In light of the Register's response, the district court granted Defendants' motion for summary judgment, declaring Fiesta's copyright registration to be invalid as to the 1461 Design and dismissing Fiesta's claims with prejudice. Defendants moved for an award of attorney's fees and costs, which the district court granted in the amount of $ 121,423.01.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In the meantime, Fiesta submitted a separate copyright registration application for the 1461 Design, certifying that it was first published on March 12, 2013, approximately six months prior to the date of the original '509 Registration. The Copyright Office issued Registration No. VA 2-006-252 (the \" '252 Registration\"). Citing Fiesta's lack of diligence, the district court denied Fiesta leave to amend its complaint to add the '252 Registration as the basis for its claims. Fiesta has not appealed this ruling. Rather, Fiesta filed a second action based upon the '252 Registration of the 1461 Design.\n   <em>\n    Gold Value Int'l Textile, Inc. v. Sanctuary Clothing, LLC\n   </em>\n   , 2:17-cv-03726 (C.D.

The 1461 Design was registered as part of an unpublished collection. Fiesta suggests that it made a mistake by failing to include a publication date in its application, which could be corrected by a supplemental registration. Fiesta's error was to include published works in an unpublished collection, however. Adding a publication date to the application would not correct this error, because the Copyright Office would not have registered a published design as part of an unpublished collection.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    L.A.

Fiesta provides no authority for the proposition that published and unpublished works may be registered as a group, which is contrary to the regulations, guidance from the Copyright Office, and caselaw.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3757522\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/676/841/#p846\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   ;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=37%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20202.3\">\n    37 C.F.R. \u00a7 202.3\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(4)(i)(B) (effective July 6, 2007) (permitting registration of \"unpublished works ... combined in a single unpublished 'collection.' \"); U.S. Copyright Office,\n   <em>\n    Compendium of U.S. Copyright Office Practices\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 607 (2d ed. 1984) (\"\n   <em>\n    Compendium II\n   </em>\n   \") (\"For the purpose of registration on a single application and payment of a single fee, a number of unpublished works may be registered as a single work.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Fiesta also contends that its '509 Registration was accurate because any publication of the 1461 Design was a \"limited\" distribution for promotional purposes and did not constitute legal publication under the limited publication doctrine.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Acad. of Motion Picture Arts &amp; Scis. v.

In its second copyright application, however, Fiesta certified that the date of first publication of the 1461 Design was March 12, 2013, when Fiesta began selling sample fabric bearing the 1461 Design to its customers. Thus, Fiesta admitted that this allegedly limited distribution constituted legal publication, and that the publication occurred prior to the registration of the 1461 Design as part of an unpublished collection.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Moreover, Fiesta cannot demonstrate that it distributed the fabric \"for a limited purpose, without the right of further reproduction, distribution or sale.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 1452.

The district court found that Fiesta knew the information in the application was inaccurate because it knew that it had previously sold fabric bearing the 1461 Design to customers when it applied for the '509 Registration. Fiesta argues that it did not know that the sale of samples to its customers constituted publication as a matter of law under the Copyright Act, and therefore, it did not have the requisite knowledge or fraudulent intent. The district court characterized Fiesta's position as one of \"ignorance of the law,\" which is \"no excuse,\" and determined that a showing of fraudulent intent is not required to invalidate a copyright registration under \u00a7 411(b).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Both parties rely upon\n   <em>\n    L.A.

L.A. Printex filed an application\n   for supplementary registration to remove the two previously published designs and the Copyright Office issued a certificate of supplementary registration for Small Flower Group A. The defendant argued that L.A. Printex's registration for the design at issue was invalid. Rejecting this argument, we stated that \"[t]he record, when viewed in the light most favorable to L.A.

Printex\n   </em>\n   , Fiesta could not correct its registration by removing the published designs, including the 1461 Design. Had it done so, the '509 Registration would properly include only unpublished designs, but it could not serve as a basis for this action, because it would no longer include the 1461 Design. The district court determined that because the Copyright Office would not have registered the 1461 Design as part of an unpublished collection, \u00a7 411(b)(1)(B) was met and the registration was invalid as to the 1461 Design.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   In light of the Register's response, we agree that \u00a7 411(b)(1)(B) is satisfied and that the inaccuracy in the '509 registration renders it invalid as to the 1461 Design. Fiesta included inaccurate information regarding the 1461 Design in its application, knew the information was inaccurate, and the Register would have refused registration of the collection if it had been aware of the inaccuracy. The district court properly declared the '509 registration invalid as to the 1461 Design, pursuant to \u00a7 411(b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because a valid registration is a precondition to bringing an action for infringement, we affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   IV.\n   <em>\n    Attorney's Fees\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Fiesta asserts that the district court erred by granting attorney's fees in favor of Defendants.
