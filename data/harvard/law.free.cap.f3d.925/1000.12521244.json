Factual History\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 2012, the EPA began an informal consultation process with the Services about a proposed rule for regulating the requirements governing the operation of cooling water intake structures. The EPA requested a formal consultation on the proposed rule in 2013. On November 4, 2013, the Services received a revised version of the proposed rule from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). On November 15, 2013, the Services sent a \"Description of the Action\" (i.e. a summary of what the Services thought the proposed rule set out to do) to the EPA. Finally, on November 26, 2013, the EPA responded with corrections to the Services' description of the rule and the Services incorporated the EPA's corrections. The EPA and the Services tentatively agreed that the FWS and NMFS would each provide a draft biological opinion to the EPA by December 6, 2013, and a final opinion by December 20, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After reviewing the November 2013 proposed rule, both Services prepared draft opinions finding that the rule in its then-current form was likely to cause jeopardy for ESA-protected species and negatively impact their designated critical habitats. The Services also proposed RPAs to accompany those jeopardy opinions. At the same time, NMFS discussed whether the jeopardy opinions should be sent to \"the Hill\" or OMB, or posted to its docket,\n   which was publicly available at regulations.gov.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   NMFS completed its draft jeopardy opinion on December 6, 2013 and FWS completed its draft jeopardy opinion on December 9, 2013, both for transmission to the EPA. The ESA regulations require that the Services make draft opinions available to the Federal agency that initiated the formal consultation upon request.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20402.14\">\n    50 C.F.R. \u00a7 402.14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(5). Here, the Services sent the EPA portions of its December 2013 draft jeopardy opinions, but never formally transmitted them in their entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On December 12, 2013, the FWS Deputy Solicitor called and emailed the EPA General Counsel to \"touch base ... about transmitting a document to EPA.\" He also emailed \"the current draft RPAs\" to the EPA that same day. On December 17, 2013, the NMFS sent a \"Revised Combined NMFS and USFWS RPA\" to the EPA. The Services have further indicated in their briefing that they also provided other unspecified portions of the draft jeopardy opinions to the EPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   After the transmission of these partial December 2013 jeopardy biological opinions and accompanying documents, the EPA issued a new version of the rule, the \"final Rule and Preamble,\" which it sent to the Services on March 14, 2014. On April 7, 2014, NMFS employees completed and internally circulated a draft of another jeopardy biological opinion. During this same time frame, the Services and the EPA discussed whether the EPA agreed with the Services' interpretation and understanding of the March 2014 final rule: On March 31, 2014 the Services sent the EPA a document \"seeking clarification on the Services' understandings of key elements in EPA's proposed action.\" On April 8, 2014, EPA \"provided confirmation on the Services' description and understanding of the key elements of EPA proposed action.\" Finally, on May 19, 2014, the Services issued a joint final \"no jeopardy\" biological opinion regarding the March 2014 final rule. The EPA issued the regulation that same day, and it was published in the Federal Register on August 15, 2014.

For the reasons explained below, we conclude that the December 2013 draft jeopardy biological opinions (NMFS 44516.1 and FWS 252), the accompanying statistical table (NMFS 61721), the accompanying instructional documents (NMFS 5597.1, NMFS 7544.2, NMFS 37695, NMFS 37667, NMFS 14973.1), and the March 2014 RPA (FWS 555) were not both pre-decisional and deliberative. We therefore AFFIRM in part the district court's summary judgment order requiring the production of these records. There is, however, sufficient support for concluding the December 2013 RPAs (FWS 279, 308) and the April 2014 draft jeopardy opinion (NMFS 5427.1) were pre-decisional and deliberative. Because these records satisfy the standard for non-disclosure under FOIA Exemption 5, we REVERSE the district court's order for their production.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <strong>\n    a.

April 2014 NMFS Draft Biological Opinion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   We agree that the April 2014 draft jeopardy opinion (NMFS 542.71) was prepared as an internal agency document. It was only circulated between groups of NMFS employees, and there is nothing in the record that indicates that the jeopardy finding was communicated even informally\n   to the EPA. Where one document reflects an earlier position of the agency-as the April 2014 draft jeopardy opinion does here when compared with the May 2014 final no jeopardy opinion-it is pre-decisional as to the issues addressed in both.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Nat. Wildlife Fed.\n   </em>\n   , 861 F.2d at 1120 (documents that were \"working drafts\" subject to revision are pre-decisional). In other words, it does not appear to represent the conclusion of the agency on the likely impact of the final March 2014 rule, but rather is an interim step, communicated only internally within NMFS. The document expressed the agency staff's initial opinion as to the rule. NMFS never adopted that opinion as the agency's; instead, the NMFS ultimately joined the FWS in a final joint no jeopardy opinion in May 2014 regarding the final March 2014 rule.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   <strong>\n    2. RPAs\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   We also agree that the December 2013 RPAs (FWS 279, 308) are pre-decisional because they appear to be earlier drafts of the third, March 2014 RPA (FWS 555). In other words, the December 2013 RPAs do not reflect the FWS' final position regarding the kinds of changes the November 2013 version of the rule needed in order to comply with the ESA. The December 2013 RPAs, but not the March 2014 RPA, are therefore pre-decisional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   <strong>\n    3. 2013 Draft Biological Opinions\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   We disagree with the Services, however, that the December 2013 draft jeopardy opinions (NMFS 44516.1; FWS 252) are pre-decisional. These two jeopardy opinions represent the final view of the Services regarding the then-current November 2013 proposed rule; the May 2014 no jeopardy opinion represents the final view of Services regarding the later March 2014 revised, proposed rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   Both the Supreme Court and this court have held that the issuance of a biological opinion is a final agency action.\n   <em>\n    Bennett v.

So our focus is on whether each document at issue is pre-decisional as to a biological opinion, not whether it is pre-decisional as to the EPA's rulemaking. Although the December 2013 biological opinions in this case were not\n   <em>\n    publicly\n   </em>\n   issued, they nonetheless represent the Services' final views and recommendations regarding the EPA's then-proposed regulation. The purpose of the December 2013 jeopardy biological opinions and their accompanying documents was not to advise another decision-maker higher up the chain about what the Service's position should be on the proposed rule. Instead, these opinions, created pursuant to an ESA Section 7 formal consultation, contain the final conclusions by the final decision-makers-the consulting Services-regarding whether a proposed regulation will harm protected species and habitat.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   50 C.F.R. 402.14(h)(3) (a biological opinion is \"[t]he\n   <em>\n    Service's\n   </em>\n   opinion\n   on whether the action is likely to jeopardize the continued existence of listed species. ...\") (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Where, as here, a document is created by a final decision-maker and represents the final view of an entire agency as to a matter which, once concluded, is a final agency action independent of another agency's use of that document, it is not pre-decisional.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Maricopa II\n   </em>\n   , 108 F.3d at 1094 (Forest Service's internal investigative report was prepared to advise the Chief of the Forest Service on how the agency should respond to misconduct allegations and was thus predecisional);\n   <em>\n    Kowack v.

The documents had been approved by final decision-makers at each agency: the email correspondence in the record indicates Gary Frazer, the Assistant Director for Ecological Services at FWS who was responsible for overseeing and administering ESA consultations, made final edits to the FWS Service December 9, 2013 jeopardy opinion and that the document was awaiting his autopen signature. NMFS meanwhile was preparing \"talking points\" for its legislative affairs staff and preparing to release the drafts to the public.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Moreover, the Services' own account indicates that the EPA made changes to its proposed regulations\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   December 2013-that is, after both Services' jeopardy opinions were completed and partially transmitted to the EPA-and that the \"final\" May 2014 Biological Opinion reflected the Services' opinion concerning the EPA's later\n   <em>\n    revised\n   </em>\n   proposed regulation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The fact that the December 2013 jeopardy opinions predated the later no jeopardy opinion does not render them predecisional. \"[M]aterial which predate[s] a decision chronologically, but did not contribute to that decision is not predecisional in any meaningful sense.\"\n   <em>\n    Assembly of Cal.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10518092\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/968/916/#p920\">\n    968 F.2d at 921\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (census data prepared by the Department of Commerce \"solely for the purpose of post-decision dissemination\" if the Secretary decided to adjust the census was not pre-decisional merely because it predated the Secretary's decision). The December 2013 jeopardy opinions pre-date the May 2014 no jeopardy opinion, but address and thus make final conclusions about a different version of the EPA's rule. These earlier opinions therefore were not pre-decisional with respect to the later opinion, which addressed a different proposed rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   <strong>\n    4. Other Documents\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   We disagree with the Services' arguments that the remaining documents, which accompanied the December 2013 draft jeopardy opinions, were pre-decisional because they were either \"modified\" or excluded from the May 2014 final no jeopardy opinion. These documents-1) a statistical table showing estimated aggregate effects of cooling water intake structures on ESA-protected species (NMFS 61721); 2) several instructional documents for cooling water intake structure operators detailing how to abate the harmful impacts of those structures on specific species (NMFS 5597.1, \"Abalone Measures\"), (NMFS 7544.2, \"Andromous Salmonid Measures\"), (NMFS 37695, \"Pinniped Measures\"), and (NMFS 37667, \"Sea Turtle Requirements\"); and 3) \"Terms and Conditions\" that operators of cooling water intake structures must follow in implementing\n   the RPAs (NMFS 14973.1)-were largely instructional, and intended to explain best practices for mitigating the projected, harmful effects of the November 2013 proposed rule. They were not early-stage recommendations for mitigating the impacts of the revised, March 2014 rule, and are thus not pre-decisional as to the May 2014 no jeopardy opinion the Services issued in response to that later rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   <strong>\n    b.

Such documents would likely satisfy the two aforementioned conditions of 1) being an inter-agency memorandum that 2) fell within the ambit of deliberative process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   In the case before the court, we know that the draft opinion was transmitted piecemeal to the EPA, the Services and the EPA agreed to extend the time frame for the consultation, and that \"[u]ltimately\n   <em>\n    based on changes to the regulation\n   </em>\n   , the Services' final conclusion was that the regulation\"-the final version-\"was not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of listed species nor likely to destroy or adversely modify critical habitat.\" (emphasis added). The fact that the decision to revise the rule after the jeopardy finding was the result of additional back-and-forth between the Services and the EPA-deliberative discussions that are not memorialized in the documents before us-does not render the December 2013 opinions or accompanying documents pre-decisional or deliberative as to the Services' opinion about the November 2013 version of the EPA regulation or as to the Services' later conclusion about a different version of the rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <strong>\n    1. 2013 Draft Biological Opinions and Other Documents\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   After reviewing the documents in this case in camera to make a\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   determination, we conclude that neither the December 2013 draft jeopardy opinions (NMFS 44516.1; FWS 252), nor the accompanying statistical and instructional documents (NMFS 5597.1, NMFS 7544.2, NMFS 37695, NMFS 37667, NMFS 14973.1) were prepared by low-level officials, or contain merely tentative findings. These are final products that reflect the agencies' findings on the jeopardy posed\n   by the November 2013 proposed rule, and their recommendations for mitigating the harmful impacts of that rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   We note that the documents do not contain line edits, marginal comments, or other written material that expose any internal agency discussion about the jeopardy finding. Nor do these documents contain any insertions or writings reflecting input from lower level employees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The two December 2013 opinions both state they were prepared on behalf of the entire agency and represent that agency's opinion. And the record shows that preparations were being made for the NMFS opinion (NMFS 44516.1), as is, to be publicly \"roll[ed] out\" and published in the administrative record; the FWS opinion (FWS 252), which includes its agency's seal/header, had received final edits from a senior official and was just awaiting his autopen signature.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The only thing the December 2013 draft jeopardy opinions have in common with the draft Forest Plans and EISs in\n   <em>\n    National Wildlife Federation\n   </em>\n   is that they were referred to as \"draft\" documents. But to treat them similarly would ignore clear substantive distinctions. Unlike the documents in\n   <em>\n    National Wildlife Federation\n   </em>\n   , these opinions and accompanying documents represent the final view of the Services on the likely impact of the then-proposed regulation. These final jeopardy opinions from December 2013 pertain to a different rule and are not \"earlier draft\" versions of the no jeopardy opinion from May 2014; that later opinion addressed a new and different proposed rule.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Moreover, taking seriously our obligation to consider the underlying purpose of the deliberative process privilege, these documents do not reveal more about the internal deliberative process that the Services went through before issuing their joint May 2014 no jeopardy opinion than what the Services themselves have already disclosed during this litigation: that the initial proposed regulation resulted in final drafts of jeopardy opinions in December 2013, that the EPA received portions of those opinions and proposed a revised regulation at some point after that, and that the Services ultimately issued a no jeopardy opinion for that revised, proposed regulation. Nor do the December 2013 jeopardy opinions reveal either the Services' internal deliberative processes that lead to reaching those opinions or the EPA's internal deliberative process that resulted in revising the draft regulation.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Assembly of Cal. v.

There is no later draft of the Services' opinion regarding the November 2013 version of the rule that a discerning reader could compare to the two December 2013 opinions requested here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Again, the statistical table (NMFS 61721) and the instructional documents and terms and conditions (NMFS 5597.1, NMFS 7544.2, NMFS 37695, NMFS 37667, NMFS 14973.1) summarize the Services' best practices and recommendations for mitigating environmental harm to certain species, and effectively monitoring the welfare of certain protected species should they appear in the vicinity of a water cooling intake structure. They do not reveal any internal discussions about how those recommendations were vetted and are thus not deliberative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   <strong>\n    2. RPAs\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Our analysis regarding the December 2013 RPAs (FWS 279, 308) is different from our analysis concerning the December 2013 Draft Biological Opinions and Other Documents because, as discussed above, they\n   <em>\n    do\n   </em>\n   appear to be successive drafts of the Services' recommendations for the November 2013 proposed rule. And comparing these drafts would shed light on FWS' internal vetting process. Thus, considering\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   whether the Services have carried their burden in showing that these documents are deliberative, we find that they have done so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   By comparison, disclosure of only the March 2014 RPA (FWS 555) will offer no insights into the agency's internal deliberations. It appears to be the final version in a progression of agency recommendations about how to amend the November 2013 proposed rule. The Services have offered no evidence that there were any subsequent versions of this RPA addressing the November 2013 proposed rule. The March 2014 RPA is therefore not deliberative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    3. April 2014 NMFS Draft Biological Opinion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Finally, we agree with the Services that the NMFS April 2014 draft jeopardy biological opinion is deliberative. As discussed above, it addresses the revised rule that the EPA proposed in March 2014. A reader could thus conceivably reconstruct some of the deliberations that occurred between the April 2014 and May 2014 opinions by comparing the two. Additionally, the Acting Assistant Administrator for NMFS testified in an affidavit provided to the district court that this draft of the jeopardy opinion was only circulated internally between one employee and a group of other lower-level employees. The April 2014 draft jeopardy opinion is therefore deliberative and subject to Exemption 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   For the foregoing reasons the district court's order to produce the December 2013 draft jeopardy biological opinions (NMFS 44516.1 and FWS 252), the March 2014 RPA (FWS 555), and the remaining statistical and instructional documents (NMFS 5597.1, NMFS 61721, NMFS 7544.2, NMFS 37695, NMFS 37667, NMFS 14973.1) is\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED\n   </strong>\n   because the record shows that these materials are not both pre-decisional and deliberative and therefore not exempt under \u00a7 522(b)(5) of FOIA, Exemption 5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   The district court's order to produce the December 2013 RPAs (FWS 279, 308) and the April 2014 draft jeopardy opinion (NMFS 5427.1) is\n   <strong>\n    REVERSED\n   </strong>\n   because these materials are both pre-decisional and deliberative and thus exempt from disclosure under FOIA Exemption 5. The parties agree that reversal would require the district court to perform a segregability analysis on remand. We instruct the district court to perform that analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The case is\n   <strong>\n    REMANDED\n   </strong>\n   for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   WALLACE, Circuit Judge, concurring in the result in part and dissenting in part:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   I concur in the result reached by the majority as to the April 2014 draft opinion (NMFS 5427.1) and the December 2013 RPAs (FWS 279, 308). I dissent from the result reached by the majority as to the rest of the documents. I respectfully disagree with my colleagues that the deliberative process privilege does not protect the December draft opinions (NMFS 44516.1, FWS 252) and other documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   The majority overlooks the \"context of the administrative process which generated\" the December draft opinions.\n   <em>\n    NLRB. v.

The regulations governing that process make clear that the purpose of agency review is to allow the Services to consider changes to the draft opinion based on the agency's comments. Specifically, the regulations forbid the Services from issuing the final opinion before the agency has had time to comment on the draft and build in time for the Services to revise a draft opinion to incorporate or respond to any agency comments.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20402.14\">\n    50 C.F.R. \u00a7 402.14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(5) (Services cannot issue the final opinion \"prior to the 45-day or extended deadline while the draft is under [the agency's] review\" and if the agency submits comments within 10 days of the final opinion deadline, the Services are entitled to a 10-day deadline extension). The preamble to the regulations explains that the \"release of draft opinions to Federal agencies ... facilitates a more meaningful exchange of information,\" \"may result in the development and submission of additional data, and the preparation of more thorough biological opinions,\" and \"helps ensure the technical accuracy of the opinion.\"\n   <em>\n    Interagency Cooperation-Endangered Species Act of 1973\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=51%20Fed.%20Reg.%2019%2C926\">\n    51 Fed. Reg. 19,926\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 19,952 (June 3, 1986). Therefore, the regulations governing formal consultations set up a process by which the Services may receive feedback from the agency on draft opinions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-110\">\n   Moreover, a formal consultation may involve not only the Services making a jeopardy decision, but also a decision about what alternative actions are reasonable and prudent, so-called RPAs. The Services and the agency \"work[ ] closely\" on the \"development of [RPAs]\" contained in a jeopardy opinion.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=51%20Fed.%20Reg.%2019%2C926\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The \"provision to review draft biological opinions\" provides the necessary \"exchange of information for the development of [RPAs].\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=51%20Fed.%20Reg.%2019%2C926\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The Services \"will, in most cases, defer to the Federal agency's expertise and judgment\" as to whether a draft RPA is feasible, but if the Services disagree, the Services make the ultimate call.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=51%20Fed.%20Reg.%2019%2C926\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, even though the Services have discretion as to whether to accept the EPA's comments, the purpose of agency review is to seek the agency's advice on the draft opinion. Seeking comments on a document presupposes the ability to make changes to it, showing it is pre-decisional. It also shows the deliberative nature of the process. Accordingly, the administrative context shows that draft opinions are generally both pre-decisional and deliberative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   A quick look at the record in this case dispels any doubt that the December draft opinions are pre-decisional and deliberative. The FWS draft opinion requests that the EPA \"provide any comments\" and states that the FWS would need about ten days after receiving comments, assuming they are not substantial, to issue the final opinion. Likewise, the government submitted declarations of two management-level Service employees stating that the drafts were subject to revision. Gary Frazer, assistant director of the FWS, stated that both draft opinions \"were subject to internal\n   review within FWS and the Department of the Interior and consultation with the EPA.\" Samuel D. Rauch, an administrator at the NMFS, stated that by transmitting a draft opinion to the EPA, the \"NMFS is not rendering a final decision\" and the document \"remains a draft and is subject to change until final signature.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   The majority asserts that there is nothing in the record that \"indicates whether the EPA sent ... comments to the Services\" on the December draft opinions. Of course, there is not. As the majority observes, the Services \"never formally transmitted\" the drafts to the EPA. The EPA could not mark up a document it never received. The record, however, is clear that the EPA and the Services engaged in extensive discussions about the draft opinions before and after the December 6 deadline. As the deadline approached, the Services decided based on \"internal review and\n   <em>\n    interagency\n   </em>\n   review in December\" that \"additional consultation [with the EPA] was needed to better understand and consider the operation of key elements of EPA's rule.\" The EPA and the Services \"agreed[ ] that more work needed to be done and agreed to extend the time frame for the consultation.\" That the EPA and the Services jointly concluded the draft opinions needed more work shows their predecisional and deliberative nature: the Services had not made a final decision as of December and the deliberative process was ongoing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   The majority and Sierra Club argue that because the December draft opinions were the Services' \"final\" word on the November 2013 regulations, the opinions are not predecisional. I disagree. The Services' decision would become final only \"once the biological opinion is issued.\"\n   <em>\n    Ctr. for Biological Diversity v.

The majority's observation that the December draft opinions did not contribute to the Services' later decision about the March 2014 regulations is beside the point. The draft opinions are pre-decisional as to the November 2013 regulations, which the EPA changed before finalizing. That the Services never gave their final word as to those regulations does not strip the drafts of their privileged status. A draft that \"die[s] on the vine .... is still a draft and thus still pre-decisional and deliberative.\"\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Sec. Archive v.

But even if true, those facts do not show that the drafts are not deliberative. It is well established that circulation of a draft opinion to\n   <em>\n    another\n   </em>\n   agency does not change its privileged status, any more than circulation\n   <em>\n    within\n   </em>\n   the agency. The Supreme Court has spoken decisively on this point: \"By including inter-agency memoranda in Exemption 5, Congress plainly intended to permit one agency possessing decisional authority to obtain written recommendations and advice from a separate agency not possessing such decisional authority without requiring that the advice be any more disclosable than similar advice received from within the agency.\"\n   <em>\n    Renegotiation Bd. v.Grumman Aircraft Eng'g Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"541492\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/421/168/#p188\">\n    421 U.S. 168\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 188,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"541492\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/421/168/#p188\">\n    95 S.Ct. 1491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"541492\" index=\"76\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/421/168/#p188\">\n    44 L.Ed.2d 57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1975). Here, the Services had decisional authority in preparing the opinions, but sought advice from the EPA about the decision.\n   <em>\n    Grumman Aircraft\n   </em>\n   teaches that is precisely the type of inter-agency\n   process that Congress designed the privilege to protect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   The majority's decision sets out a categorical rule that the deliberative process privilege protects only documents \"reflecting the opinions of individuals or groups of employees rather than the position of an entire agency.\" This rule contravenes\n   <em>\n    Grumman Aircraft\n   </em>\n   , which acknowledged Exemption 5's parity between inter- and intra-agency drafts. 421 U.S. at 188,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"541492\" index=\"77\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/421/168/#p188\">\n    95 S.Ct. 1491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Therefore, even if the majority is right that these cases show that \"opinions of individuals or groups of employees\" are generally deliberative, they do not support the contrary proposition that \"the position of an entire agency\" can never be deliberative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Sierra Club makes much of the fact that \"the Services typically include draft biological opinions in their administrative records.\" Again, even if true, the government's waiver of privilege in some contexts does not waive the privilege here,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Assembly of Cal. v.

It does not require draft opinions shared with the EPA to be \"significant\" or to constitute a formal statement of the Services' conclusions. The regulation states that the Services must, upon the agency's request, \"make available to the Federal agency the draft biological opinion for the purpose of analyzing the [RPAs].\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"83\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20402.14\">\n    50 C.F.R. \u00a7 402.14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(5). The regulation, however, does not provide that a draft opinion shared with an agency be at any particular level of completion or approval. For example, nothing appears to preclude the EPA from requesting to see a draft at the beginning of the process. It also does not require that the Services\n   <em>\n    ever\n   </em>\n   provide a draft opinion to the EPA if the EPA does not request it. Given that \"Exemption 5 does not distinguish between inter-agency and intra-agency\" drafts,\n   <em>\n    Grumman Aircraft\n   </em>\n   , 421 U.S. at 188,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"541492\" index=\"84\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/421/168/#p188\">\n    95 S.Ct. 1491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , a draft opinion sent to the EPA is no more disclosable than a draft sent from one working group within the Service to another.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   In conclusion, the administrative process that generated the draft opinions shows that they are pre-decisional and deliberative. They are pre-decisional because they do not reflect the Services' final jeopardy and RPA decisions as to the November 2013 regulations. They are deliberative because they are \"part of the deliberative process\" by which the Services and the EPA consult on those decisions.\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Wildlife Fed'n v. U.S. Forest Serv.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10535430\" index=\"85\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/861/1114/#p1118\">\n    861 F.2d 1114\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1118 (9th Cir. 1988). I conclude that the Services may withhold them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   The deliberative process privilege also protects the other documents at issue in\n   this case. Because the NMFS never finalized or adopted the April draft jeopardy opinion (NMFS 5427.1), my analysis above applies to it with equal force. The same is true for the three draft RPAs (FWS 279, FWS 308, FWS 555), which were part of never-finalized jeopardy opinions. In addition, the Services should be able to withhold the four species-specific protective measures (NMFS 5597.1, NMFS 7544.2, NMFS 37695, NMFS 37667), the affected species table (NMFS 61721), and the terms and conditions (NMFS 14973.1). The protective measures are earlier versions of those included in the final opinion. Likewise, NMFS decided not to include the table in the final opinion after deliberations among scientists. Finally, NMFS staff circulated the terms and conditions internally as a possible precedent for a section of the final opinion. In each case, the documents are privileged because disclosure would allow Sierra Club to \"probe the editorial and policy judgment of the decisionmakers\" by comparing the draft versions to what the Services finally published.\n   <em>\n    Nat'l Wildlife\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10535430\" index=\"86\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/861/1114/#p1118\">\n    861 F.2d at 1122\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   In conclusion, I would reverse the district court's judgment ordering production of all twelve documents and instruct it to perform a segregability analysis on remand.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    <em>\n     Riverkeeper, Inc. v.
