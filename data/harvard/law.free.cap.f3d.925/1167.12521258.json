Resolution of this appeal largely rests on whether Bergelectric's installation of solar panels constitutes \"roofing work.\" We conclude that Bergelectric was not performing roofing work and that substantial evidence supports the finding that it did not comply with the stricter safety standards governing work on unprotected sides and edges. We\n   <strong>\n    DENY\n   </strong>\n   the petition for review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Bergelectric Corporation (\"Bergelectric\") is a California-based electrical contractor. As a single part of a larger renovation project, Bergelectric was hired to install photovoltaic panels (i.e., solar panels) on the roof of a hangar at the Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in San Diego, California. Beginning on February 24, 2016, Compliance Safety and Health Officer Eric Christensen conducted a two-day inspection of the project, including inspection of Bergelectric's activities at the worksite.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   During the inspection, four Bergelectric employees were installing solar panels on the upper roof of the hangar. Bergelectric employees informed Christensen that they were using warning lines and a safety monitor to comply with fall protection obligations. Additionally, the employees indicated they would affix personal fall arrest systems (\"PFAS\") if they moved outside the warning lines. During his time on site, Christensen observed no employees using PFAS and no guardrails in place. The site had no safety nets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Based on the inspection, OSHA issued a citation alleging three serious violations of the fall protection standards found in Subpart M of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (\"the Act\"),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20659\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 659\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c). One violation was based on the general standards of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201926.501\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926.501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(1), which require employees working near the unprotected sides and edges of certain roofs to be protected by guardrail systems, safety net systems, or PFAS. Two violations were based on the alternative standards of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201926.501\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926.501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(10), which apply to employees performing roofing work on low-sloped roofs and allow fall protection obligations to be satisfied by the use of warning lines and a safety monitor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Following a hearing, the administrative law judge (\"ALJ\") found that the principal fall standard of \u00a7 (b)(1) applied because Bergelectric employees were not performing \"roofing work,\" and that Bergelectric violated the standard because it failed to use PFAS, safety nets, or guardrails.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Bergelectric appealed the order to the Commission, which declined review. Therefore, the decision of the ALJ became a final order of the Commission in 2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Bergelectric appeals its violation to this court pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20660\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 660\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . It argues the ALJ erred by applying \u00a7 (b)(1) rather than \u00a7 (b)(10), and that it complied with \u00a7 (b)(10). Bergelectric also argues that, since evidence indicated that its employees would have used PFAS had they moved outside the warning lines, the Secretary cannot prove that the employees were exposed to a risk of falling. We conclude neither argument has merit and the Commission's decision is supported by substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <strong>\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The court has jurisdiction to review the Commission's final order under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20660\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 660\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a).

It makes clear that roofing work does not extend to all materials and equipment that could be applied atop a roof, but rather\n   <em>\n    roofing\n   </em>\n   materials and equipment.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201926.500\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   And there is no trickery here: the plain meaning of the verb \"roof\" is to \"provide or cover with a roof.\"\n   <em>\n    Roof\n   </em>\n   , Oxford English Dictionary, http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/167251 (last visited May 2, 2019);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Safe Air For Everyone v.

To constitute roofing materials and equipment, the materials and equipment must be connected to the act of roofing. This is confirmed by the examples of roofing materials and equipment offered by section 1926.500(b), each of which is an item or process used to roof a building: \"related insulation, sheet metal, and vapor barrier work.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Here, Bergelectric's activities on the hangar have no connection to roofing and were, instead, simply the installation of a system that often happens to sit atop a roof. There is no evidence that Bergelectric was hired to perform anything other than the installation of solar panels, much less work connected to the roofing of the hangar. Therefore, the safety standards of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201926.501\">\n    29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1926.501\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(10) are inapplicable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <strong>\n    II.

Most obviously, \u00a7 (b)(1) requires that Bergelectric protect its employees from falling by providing guardrail systems, safety net systems, or PFAS. Evidence in the record showed it used none of the three. Christensen testified that no employees were using PFAS on the roof of the hangar, and there were no guardrails erected. The parties stipulated that safety nets were not in place around the hangar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Bergelectric is not saved by its contention that, since its employees would have used PFAS had they stepped outside the company's warning lines, the Secretary\n   cannot prove that the employees were ever exposed to a fall hazard. Bergelectric overlooks that exposure to a violative condition can be established by showing that access to the hazard was reasonably predictable, regardless of actual exposure.\n   <em>\n    Sec'y of Labor v.

Multiple employees worked within eight or nine feet of an unprotected edge. The ALJ considered photographs showing that the structure of the upper roof presented the potential for inadvertent tripping and stumbling, including raised seams running the entire length of the roof and wire cabling adjacent to the warning lines. Being eight or nine feet from an unprotected edge-coupled with evidence that tripping hazards existed which could bring them even closer to the edge-is sufficient to find the employees were exposed to a fall hazard.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sec'y of Labor v.
