After further motion practice and discovery, the district court granted summary judgment for the Dealership Defendants and AHFC and dismissed Singh's claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On appeal, Singh contends that the district court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction at the time of removal and, for that reason, erred when it denied his motion to remand.

Finally, Singh contends that the district court did not permit him sufficient discovery before granting summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We hold that the district court did not have subject-matter jurisdiction over this action at the time of removal because CAFA's home state exception barred the exercise of jurisdiction. However, the district court had subject-matter jurisdiction at the time it rendered a final decision on the merits, because Singh voluntarily amended his complaint to assert a federal TILA claim. \"To wipe out the adjudication postjudgment, and return to state court a case now satisfying all federal jurisdictional requirements, would impose an exorbitant cost on our dual court system, a cost incompatible with the fair and unprotracted administration of justice.\"\n   <em>\n    Caterpillar Inc. v.

We decline to impose such a cost.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On the merits, we hold that the district court properly granted summary judgment to the Dealership Defendants and AHFC. We also hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Singh's request for more time for discovery. We affirm the district court's judgment in full.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In February 2016, Singh bought a new Honda Accord from Hinshaw's Honda in Auburn, Washington. The Accord had two stickers. The first sticker listed the car's standard features and a Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (\"MSRP\") of $28,670.00.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The other sticker listed a \"dealer price\" of $29,505.00, as well as individual costs for three dealer add-ons: \"3M,\" \"Pro Pak,\" and \"New Car Detail &amp; Dealer Prep\" (\"Dealer Prep\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   With the add-ons, the listed price of the car was $30,632.00.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Singh negotiated the price of his new Accord down to $27,356.97, before taxes and fees. Singh did not know what the add-ons were when he purchased the car, nor did anyone at Hinshaw's explain them to him. Singh nonetheless thought he was paying for the add-ons because they were listed on the Dealer Addendum and he was not given the chance to decline them. To finance his purchase, Singh obtained financing from AHFC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Singh signed three documents when he purchased his Accord: (1) a Purchase Order, (2) a Sales Contract, and (3) a Retail Installment Sale Contract (\"RISC\"). Singh also initialed a mandatory disclosure form. The Purchase Order listed the base price of the car as $27,356.97-the price Singh negotiated. Under the heading \"ACCESSORIES,\" it stated, \"sold w/ prep\" and \"pro pkg (muds, tray, locks).\" The Sales Contract listed the \"Base Price of Vehicle\n   and Options\" as $27,356.97. It did not list any items under the \"Dealer Added or Deleted Options\" heading. The RISC provided the terms of Singh's financing agreement with AHFC and listed the total vehicle price of the Accord, including taxes, licensing, and other fees. The RISC did not list any add-ons. Finally, on the \"Mandatory Disclosure Statement,\" Singh declined additional services and protections, including \"Rock Guard Chip Protect.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Singh brought this putative class action in Washington state superior court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Singh claimed that Hinshaw's did not provide him the three add-ons it promised on the Dealer Addendum-3M, Pro Pak, and Dealer Prep-and, if he had known what the add-ons were, he would have declined them and paid a lower price for his Accord. Singh claimed that the other Dealership Defendants engaged in similar unlawful practices. Singh further alleged that AHFC profits from the Dealership Defendants' nondisclosures because the nondisclosures lead to higher car prices, which lead to higher interest payments to AHFC from financing agreements with vehicle purchasers. Singh asserted four causes of action against the Dealership Defendants and AHFC: (1) breach of contract; (2) violation of the duty of good faith and fair dealing; (3) negligent supervision; and (4) violation of the Washington Consumer Protection Act (\"WCPA\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   AHFC removed the case to federal court under CAFA. Singh moved to remand, contending that either the home state or the local controversy exception to CAFA barred the exercise of federal subject-matter jurisdiction. The district court rejected those arguments and denied Singh's motion. Singh then amended his complaint to assert a federal TILA claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Dealership Defendants moved for summary judgment and the district court granted that motion. On Singh's breach of contract claim, the district court explained that the contract between Singh and Hinshaw's consisted of \"the Sales Contract ... RISC ... and possibly the Vehicle Purchase Order\"-the documents Singh had signed. Because none of those documents mentions 3M, Pro Pak, or Dealer Prep, the district court held that those add-ons were not part of the bargain between Hinshaw's and Singh and, for that reason, Hinshaw's did not breach its contract with Singh even if it did not provide the add-ons.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district court granted summary judgment against Singh on his WCPA claim because (1) Hinshaw's did not violate Washington's Auto Dealer's Practices Act\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (2) Singh did not demonstrate injury insofar as he paid less than the MSRP of the car. Finally, the district court granted summary judgment against Singh on his TILA claim because the contract did not include any add-ons and therefore their costs did not need to be itemized in the RISC.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Separately, AHFC moved to dismiss Singh's claims against it under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). As part of its motion, AHFC included a copy of the RISC. Singh had not attached the RISC to his complaint, so he objected to its consideration at the motion-to-dismiss stage. But Singh's response included ninety-one pages of declarations and exhibits, which likewise were not attached to his complaint. Because each party cited materials outside the complaint, the district court converted AHFC's motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment and \"deferred consideration of the motion to allow Singh a reasonable opportunity to present all material that would be pertinent.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   After further discovery, Singh objected that he had not received adequate time for discovery. The district court declined to permit Singh more time because Singh had propounded discovery requests on the defendants for two months, he attached a slew of documents obtained in discovery to his responses to the motions for summary judgment, and he did not point to any facts that he lacked.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On the merits, the district court granted summary judgment against Singh on his breach of contract claim because Singh could not show that AHFC violated any financing terms of the RISC, the only contract between AHFC and Singh.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district court granted summary judgment for AHFC on Singh's WCPA claim because AHFC was not directly involved in the allegedly deceptive practice of displaying the Dealer Addendum on vehicles.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, the district court noted that Singh had abandoned his TILA claim against AHFC, although he reserved the right to seek reinstatement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Singh filed timely notices of appeal. He contends that the district court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over this action at the time of removal and therefore erred when it denied his motion to remand. He asks that this case be remanded to Washington state court. In the alternative, Singh contends that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to the defendants, or that it erred in granting summary judgment without permitting him sufficient discovery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   We review de novo whether the district court had subject-matter jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    Chapman v.

The court should then consider whether the defendant is sued directly or alleged to be directly responsible for the harm to the proposed class or classes, as opposed to being vicariously or secondarily liable. The court should also consider the defendant's potential exposure to the class relative to the exposure of other defendants. Courts should not treat these considerations as exhaustive or apply them mechanistically. The inquiry is whether a defendant is a \" 'principal,' 'fundamental,' or 'direct' \" defendant.\n   <em>\n    Vodenichar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3715393\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/733/497/#p505\">\n    733 F.3d at 504\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (relying on\n   <em>\n    Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary\n   </em>\n   923 (10th ed. 2002) to define \"primary\"). Finally, we agree that \"by using the word 'the' before the words 'primary defendants' rather than the word 'a,' [CAFA] requires remand under the home state exception only if all primary defendants are citizens of\" the alleged home state.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3715393\" index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/733/497/#p505\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 506 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Rubenstein,\n   <em>\n    Newberg on Class Actions\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 6:20 (\"Most courts agree that the use of the definite article in 'the primary defendants' requires that all of the primary defendants be citizens of the state in which the action was originally filed.\"). It is insufficient that only some of the primary defendants are citizens of that state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   With these principles in mind, we turn to the allegations in this case. The operative complaint at the time of removal named (1) AHFC, (2) Soraya Motor Co., (3) Arianna Motor Company, Inc., and (4) Hooman H. Bodaghi, d/b/a Hinshaw's Honda,\n   Green River Leasing, Honda of Auburn, Hooman Honda, Hooman Motors Group, Paul Hinshaw Acura, and Hooman Acura, as defendants. Singh described the \"Defendants\" as \"auto dealers and manufacturers doing business in King County, Washington.\" Singh alleged that Hooman Bodaghi either owned or was the alter ego of each of the named dealerships. He further claimed that \"Defendants\" unlawfully charge customers for vehicle add-ons that they do not include and which cannot be declined. Singh alleged that AHFC \"provides the financing for vehicles sold or leased by Defendants to the Plaintiffs\" and \"knows or should know that all of the customers are misled and improperly charged.\" AHFC allegedly \"profit[s] from the misconduct of the other Defendants\" by receiving additional interest under financing agreements with vehicle purchasers. Each cause of action is asserted against all defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Contrary to the district court's determination, we hold that the foregoing allegations show that the Dealership Defendants are the primary defendants and AHFC is a secondary defendant. The Dealership Defendants-all of whom are allegedly controlled in some manner by Hooman Bodaghi-are allegedly responsible for the direct harm to consumers: improperly charging for vehicle add-ons. AHFC's alleged liability stems from permitting this conduct and benefitting from it in the form of additional interest payments. In other words, AHFC's liability depends on a \"threshold finding\" that the Dealership Defendants acted unlawfully, demonstrating that AHFC is a secondary defendant.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Watson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4257968\" index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/821/634/#p641\">\n    821 F.3d at 641\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Moreover, it appears that the Dealership Defendants have more exposure to the class because the alleged benefit to AHFC is interest charged on improper add-ons, whereas the alleged benefit to the Dealership Defendants is the full cost of the add-ons.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Vodenichar\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3715393\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/733/497/#p505\">\n    733 F.3d at 505-06\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In holding that AHFC is a primary defendant, the district court explained in part that AHFC would be directly liable to the class for all claims because each claim in the complaint was asserted against \"Defendants,\" without differentiating between them. It was not enough, however, for the district court to look only at what claims were asserted against which defendants. Although doing so can help determine whether a defendant is directly or secondarily liable to the class and the relative exposure among defendants, a mechanical review of how many claims are asserted against a defendant is inappropriate. Here, although Singh asserts each cause of action against all defendants, Singh's description of the parties shows that AHFC benefits from the alleged misconduct of the Dealership Defendants and is, in that sense, a secondary defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   The district court also found that AHFC was a primary defendant because it \"has the most resources by which to 'satisfy a potential judgment.' \" We disagree that AHFC's ability to satisfy a potential judgment was a relevant consideration here.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nothing in the record indicates that the Dealership Defendants would be unable to satisfy any judgment rendered against them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Because the Dealership Defendants, the primary defendants, and \"two-thirds or more of the members of all proposed plaintiff classes in the aggregate ... are citizens of\" Washington State, the home state exception applies.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201332\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (d)(4)(B).

None of these documents describes the features of the Accord Singh purchased; they instead give the stock number, year, make, model, and VIN of the Accord. Singh contends that we must consider parol evidence to determine the features of the Accord he was promised. Relying on extrinsic evidence-and in particular, the Dealer Addendum-Singh contends that Hinshaw's was contractually obligated to provide him the three add-ons listed on the addendum: 3M, Pro-Pak, and Dealer Prep. Singh contends that Hinshaw's breached its agreement when it did not include All-Season Floor Mats, which were purportedly included with Pro Pak, or 3M with his Accord.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Assuming without deciding that Singh is correct that we must consider extrinsic evidence to determine the features of the Accord he was promised, Hinshaw's did not breach its contract with Singh. Considering all the extrinsic evidence offered, Singh has not demonstrated a genuine issue of material fact as to whether he was promised an add-on that he did not receive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Turning first to whether Singh was promised and provided \"3M,\" the Dealership Defendants' witnesses uniformly testified that \"3M\" refers to \"door edge guards, which [are installed] on most new cars prior to them being placed on the lot.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   On that understanding of the term,\n   Singh has not shown a breach of contract because he does not claim that he was not provided door edge guards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   However, Singh offered the declaration of Ron Kayshel that \"[b]ased on [his] understanding while [he] was employed at Hinshaw's Honda, 3M was a clear film that could be sprayed over the front hood of a car to protect its finish.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   Assuming that the declaration is sufficient to create a genuine dispute of fact as to the meaning of \"3M,\" Singh still has not established a breach of contract. If \"3M\" refers to \"a clear film that could be sprayed over the front hood of a car to protect its finish,\" then Singh explicitly declined that add-on when he initialed the Mandatory Disclosure Statement and declined \"Rock Guard Chip Protect.\" The Mandatory Disclosure Statement explains that Rock Guard Chip Protect \"[s]hields paint from any rock chips/bug damage,\" and witnesses uniformly testified that Rock Guard Chip Protect-which they also referred to as \"3M Full Kit\"-is a \"clear bra that covers the front third of a vehicle.\" In other words, Rock Guard Chip Protect is \"3M,\" as Kayshel uses that term. Singh explicitly declined that add-on. He cannot assert breach of contract for something that was not part of the bargain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   If Singh had agreed to purchase \"a clear film that could be sprayed over the front hood of a car to protect its finish,\" a charge of $999 for \"3M Full Kit\" would have appeared on his Sales Contract under the heading for \"Dealer Added or Deleted Options,\" as evidenced by the sales contracts of two former named plaintiffs in this case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   Singh's Sales Contract does not include a charge for \"3M Full Kit,\" confirming that he did not purchase it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   Turning to whether Singh was promised and provided \"Pro Pak,\" witnesses uniformly testified that \"Pro Pak\" refers to \"mud flaps, trunk tray, and wheel locks.\" This understanding is confirmed by Singh's Vehicle Purchase Order, which under the heading \"ACCESSORIES,\" states, \"pro pkg (muds, tray, locks).\" Singh admits that his car came with these items. And an internal invoice, as well as a \"New Vehicle Inventory\" sheet, confirms the same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   To survive summary judgment, Singh contends that \"Pro Pak\" also includes All-Season Floor Mats, which he never received. He relies on an \"accessories list\" for the Accord, which lists a number of potential add-ons for various cars. The list does not support Singh's contention. The list details four different \"protection packages\" for the Accord. It lists a \"Protection Package,\" which is undefined, for $453.90. It lists an \"All-Season Protection Package,\" which is defined to include a \"splash-guard set,\" \"all-season floor mats,\" and \"a trunk tray,\" for $549.60. It lists an \"All-Season Protection Package I,\" which is defined to include a \"splash-guard set,\" \"all-season floor mats,\" and \"wheel locks,\" for $458.30. And it lists an \"All-Season Protection Package II,\" which is defined to include \"all-season floor mats,\" \"a trunk tray,\" and \"wheel locks,\" for $549.60. None of these options include all four of the\n   items Singh alleges he was promised: mud flaps, a trunk tray, wheel locks, and All-Season Floor Mats. Nor does Singh explain which of the various protection package options he was allegedly promised. He instead pulls products from each. Doing so is insufficient to create a genuine dispute of material fact as to the meaning of \"Pro Pak\" in light of uniform testimony that it includes \"mud flaps, trunk tray, and wheel locks,\" and in light of the notation on Singh's Vehicle Purchase Order stating \"pro pkg (muds, tray, locks).\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The \"accessories list\" also cuts against Singh's argument. Although the \"Protection Package\" for the Accord is undefined, the \"Protection Package\" for the Civic includes \"wheel locks,\" \"trunk tray,\" and \"splash guard set\"-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the items Singh received. The Civic also has an \"All-Season Protection Package\" and \"All-Season Protection Package II\" that mirror those of the Accord, suggesting that the available packages are the same across cars. The \"Protection Package\" for the CR-V likewise includes \"wheel locks,\" \"trunk tray,\" and \"splash guard set,\" as does the \"Protection Package\" for the CR-T, Pilot, HR-V, and Odyssey. Given the items included in the \"Protection Packages\" for other Hondas, the reasonable inference is that the \"Protection Package\" for the Accord includes \"wheel locks,\" a \"trunk tray,\" and a \"splash guard set\"-the accessories Singh received. Singh has not pointed to any evidence that he was promised All-Season Floor Mats.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   Finally, as to Dealer Prep, the Dealership Defendants' witnesses testified that the dealerships generally clean a car when the car arrives on the lot. The dealerships also \"clean and detail that car again prior to delivery [to customers]. And [they] put a fee for that on the\" Dealer Addendum-\"Dealer Prep.\" Singh's Vehicle Purchase Order states it was \"sold w/ prep,\" and an internal Hinshaw's invoice and \"New Vehicle Inventory\" sheet reflect the time spent cleaning his car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Singh contends that, in charging him for \"Dealer Prep,\" Hinshaw's improperly charged Singh twice for cleaning because the cost of cleaning is allegedly included in the MSRP of a car. How this allegation relates to his theories of liability, however, is unclear. In any event, it is unsupported by the record. First, as explained, \"Dealer Prep\" refers to an additional cleaning after a car has been cleaned once and has been sitting on the lot, but before it is delivered to a customer. Singh was not charged twice for one cleaning. Second, Singh has not presented sufficient evidence to create a dispute of fact as to whether the MSRP of his Accord included the cost of cleaning. Singh's expert, Lewis Linet, Jr., surmised that, because the MSRP Sticker states that the \"Total Vehicle Price (Includes Pre-Delivery Service),\" and based on his experience, Hinshaw's double-charged Singh and other customers for preparing cars for delivery. But there is no evidence to show that \"Pre-Delivery Service\" refers to cleaning, or to the same cleaning as \"Dealer Prep.\" Singh was promised that his car would be cleaned before it was delivered, and it was. Singh has not shown a breach of contract on this point.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Because Singh has adduced no evidence that he was promised something he did not receive, the district court correctly granted summary judgment to the Dealership Defendants on Singh's breach of contract claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   <strong>\n    2\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   To prevail on his WCPA claim, Singh \"must establish five distinct elements: (1) [an] unfair or deceptive act or practice; (2) occurring in trade or commerce; (3) public interest impact; (4) injury to [Singh] in his ... business or property;\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   (5) [and] causation.\"\n   <em>\n    Hangman Ridge Training Stables, Inc. v.

Carlson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10539094\" index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/900/1346/#p1349\">\n    900 F.2d 1346\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1349 (9th Cir. 1990).\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    V\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   Finally, we consider Singh's challenges to the district court's decision to convert AHFC's motion to dismiss into a motion for summary judgment. Singh first contends that the district court incorrectly believed that he did not oppose the conversion. That contention is irrelevant. The\n   district court correctly converted AHFC's motion into one for summary judgment when the parties cited materials extrinsic to the complaint, and the district court provided Singh notice and an opportunity to respond. The district court committed no error on this point.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(d) (\"If, on a motion under Rule 12(b)(6) or 12(c), matters outside the pleadings are presented to and not excluded by the court, the motion must be treated as one for summary judgment under Rule 56.\");\n   <em>\n    Barron v.

Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56(d), \"[i]f a nonmovant\" to a motion for summary judgment \"shows by affidavit or declaration that, for specified reasons, it cannot present facts essential to justify its opposition, the court may: (1) defer considering the motion or deny it; (2) allow time to obtain affidavits or declarations or to take discovery; or (3) issue any other appropriate order.\" \"The denial of a request for a continuance of summary judgment pending further discovery is reviewed for an abuse of discretion. A district court abuses its discretion only if the party requesting a continuance can show that allowing additional discovery would have precluded summary judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Michelman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3901697\" index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/685/887/#p892\">\n    685 F.3d at 892\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Here, Singh relied on hundreds of pages of declarations, deposition transcripts, and admissions in opposing the defendants' motions for summary judgment. Those documents form a sizeable record on appeal. Singh offers conclusory statements that he needed further discovery, but Singh has not \"identif[ied] the specific facts that further discovery would have revealed or explain[ed] why those facts would have precluded summary judgment.\"\n   <em>\n    Tatum v.
