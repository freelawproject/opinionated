HIGGINSON, Circuit Judge:\n  </author>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   This personal injury Jones Act case presents two issues. The first is whether the district court erred by failing to act on an allegation that the defendant-appellee provoked the plaintiff-appellant's attorney to withdraw. The second is whether the district court erroneously granted summary judgment to the defendant-appellee because the plaintiff-appellant lacked expert medical evidence of causation. On the first issue, we affirm. On the second, we reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     BACKGROUND\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Plaintiff-Appellant James Earlton Gowdy sued Defendant-Appellee Marine Spill Response Corporation (MSRC) for unseaworthiness and Jones Act negligence. Gowdy alleged that he, while employed as a seaman aboard one of MSRC's vessels, injured his left foot when he stepped off the last rung of a ladder that was dangerously raised four feet off the floor. He also claimed that there was clutter beneath the ladder that required him to jump off to the left. There were no witnesses to the incident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Represented by attorney Matthew Shaffer, Gowdy filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas. Less than three months into the litigation, Shaffer moved to withdraw as counsel, citing \"irreconcilable differences over issues related to ... the management of this litigation.\" Gowdy opposed the motion. After a hearing, the district court permitted Shaffer to withdraw. Gowdy alleged that counsel for MSRC caused Shaffer's withdrawal by providing Shaffer with \"false and misleading information about another person with a similar name.\" Specifically, Gowdy averred that MSRC's counsel sent Shaffer certain documents from a Mississippi criminal case against someone named James\n   <em>\n    Edward\n   </em>\n   Gowdy. According to Gowdy, Shaffer pointed at MSRC's counsel at the conclusion of the hearing on the motion to withdraw and said, \"Here's the guy who sent us all this false information about you.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Following Shaffer's withdrawal, Gowdy proceeded (and remains) pro se.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   MSRC eventually moved for summary judgment. The motion was filed electronically on July 31, 2017. Three hours later, a \"Motion to Oppose Summary Judgment\" from Gowdy was electronically entered on the docket. It had been postmarked July 29, 2017. With due acknowledgement of Gowdy's pro se status, the district court construed that filing as Gowdy's response to MSRC's motion or, alternatively, a cross-motion for summary judgment. We will do the same.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   MSRC's motion began by describing Gowdy's pre-incident medical history of diabetes and chronic kidney disease, as was revealed both in Gowdy's deposition and also in the deposition of his long-time treating physician, Dr. Chad Clause. Dr. Clause's records reflected that Gowdy had been receiving treatment for pressure ulcers on his left foot for about two-and-a-half years preceding the ladder incident. The records also indicated that Gowdy went to see Dr. Clause about four days after the ladder incident. Dr. Clause's notes from that appointment stated, \"On boat, hit foot, painful, red.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   During the deposition, Dr. Clause described that appointment as concerning \"an injury\" that was \"something additional to what we were doing at that time.\" Dr. Clause also characterized that injury as a \"trauma.\" The day after Gowdy's appointment with Dr. Clause, a CT scan revealed fractures in Gowdy's left foot.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Dr. Clause's records described Gowdy's foot as having developed \"Charcot changes,\" which Dr. Clause described as a \"breakdown of certain areas of the foot.\" According to Dr. Clause, Charcot is typically experienced by patients with diabetes and it can be triggered by \"any kind of trauma to the foot.\" As Dr. Clause laid out the timeline in this case, \"From the trauma when he had an injury at work, ... that's when we ended up treating the fracture. And from the fracture ... after that is when he developed the Charcot.\" According to Dr. Clause, \"the Charcot never arose until after ... he had the fracture.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A month after the incident, Dr. Clause performed foot surgery on Gowdy. Two months after that, Gowdy underwent a second surgery to correct complications from the first. Due to continuing problems, Gowdy's foot was later amputated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   MSRC's motion for summary judgment highlighted testimony from Dr. Charles Bain, its designated biomechanical expert. Dr. Bain explained that he had examined the depositions of Gowdy and Dr. Clause along with medical records from the seven medical facilities that had treated Gowdy. He also reviewed photographs of the accident site. Based on that evidence, Dr. Bain opined that Gowdy's foot injury \"would not have occurred by Mr. Gowdy stepping off the bottom rung of the ladder.\" He specified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   Based on the various imaging studies' reports, Mr. Gowdy sustained either a high energy impact to his left mid foot or a crush injury. This type of injury would not occur by stepping off the bottom (fourth) welded rung on the wall of the engine room. Stepping off this rung can be made in a controlled manner. Even coming off the bottom rung in an uncontrolled manner is unlikely to yield the loading necessary to cause Mr. Gowdy's injuries. Mr. Gowdy has described jumping off the bottom rung. Had he done this and landed solely on his left foot, it is unlikely to see his injury pattern considering the low energy involved with this maneuver.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Dr. Bain concluded, \"[I]t is likely that Mr. Gowdy's fractures and joint disruptions in his left foot developed insidiously over\n   time and were not the result of a one-time loading event.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   MSRC's motion for summary judgment argued that Gowdy's failure to designate an expert of his own was \"fatal to his claim\" because a Jones Act plaintiff bears the burden of proving causation by medical expert testimony.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Gowdy's opposition highlighted Dr. Clause's observation that the Charcot changes had occurred in his left foot only\n   <em>\n    after\n   </em>\n   the ladder incident. Gowdy also cited three exam summaries from post-incident medical visits indicating that Gowdy's left foot evinced Charcot changes while his right foot had no deformity. He argued, \"It is something anyone can understand; you cannot step off a 48 inch high ladder rung to a metal floor and expect to not get injured.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After a hearing, the district court orally granted MSRC's motion \"because [Mr. Gowdy did] not have an expert to testify to the jury on the issue of medical causation.\" A written order followed, which stated that Gowdy's evidence was insufficient to create a genuine dispute of material fact as to whether the damage to his left foot was caused by MSRC's negligence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   With liberal construction, Gowdy's brief on appeal presents two issues for our review: (1) whether the district court erred by granting Shaffer's motion to withdraw and failing to investigate allegations that MSRC provoked the withdrawal, and (2) whether the district court erred in granting summary judgment to MSRC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     DISCUSSION\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Withdrawal of Counsel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    a. Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \"An attorney may withdraw from representation only upon leave of the court and a showing of good cause and reasonable notice to the client.\"\n   <em>\n    Matter of Wynn\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10531744,6121699\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/889/644/\">\n    889 F.2d 644\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 646 (5th Cir. 1989). The matter of attorney withdrawal is \"entrusted to the sound discretion of the court and will be overturned on appeal only for an abuse of that discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10531744,6121699\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/889/644/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quotation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    b. Analysis\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Gowdy suggests that the district court erroneously permitted his former counsel, Shaffer, to withdraw. Gowdy also argues that the district court should have investigated his allegations that MSRC was involved in the withdrawal. Both arguments fail.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   First, all evidence in the record indicates that Gowdy's attorney made a showing of good cause and provided reasonable notice to his client. Shaffer's motion to withdraw described \"irreconcilable differences over issues related to ... the management of [the] litigation\" and certified that he had conferred with his client on the matter. No evidence calls the veracity of those statements into question or suggests an alternative set of facts. Shaffer also noted accurately that withdrawal would not materially prejudice Gowdy because the litigation was in its early stages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Second, the district court took procedural care in resolving Shaffer's withdrawal motion. The court prudently held a hearing on the motion, at which time Gowdy had the opportunity to present his opposition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Finally, Gowdy's own description of the conduct that the district court allegedly failed to investigate indicates that the district court was not required to do so. Gowdy's theory is that MSRC's counsel provided Shaffer with information that Shaffer knew to be about a different person. Gowdy does not explain, nor does common sense, why information identifiably about a person unrelated to a case would cause an attorney to withdraw.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In sum, we affirm the decision to grant Shaffer's motion to withdraw and discern no error in the district court's handling of this issue.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Summary Judgment\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    a.

Stepping down from a high ladder rung and fracturing one's foot is closer to breaking one's leg after being hit by a car than to developing cancer after years of toxic tort exposure or experiencing a back injury explicable only by general working conditions underneath a train. The causal link in this case can be understood by jurors based on everyday knowledge and experience.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   The only remaining wrinkle is whether a layperson's ability to understand the injury's causal link to the ladder step changes in light of Dr. Bain's expert opinion that Gowdy's step down from the ladder did not cause the injury. When an expert casts doubt on something that is normally obvious, does the thing cease to be obvious?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Our caselaw indicates no. \"Juries are often asked to make difficult decisions and, even when expert evidence is available to assist them, they are not bound to follow the experts.

Dr. Bain stated that Gowdy \"sustained either a\n   <em>\n    high energy\n   </em>\n   impact to his left mid foot or a crush injury\" but that his \"injury would not [have] occur[ed] by stepping off the [ladder]\" because even if Gowdy had jumped off the ladder \"and landed solely on his left foot, it is unlikely to see his injury pattern considering the\n   <em>\n    low energy\n   </em>\n   involved with this maneuver.\" He asserted both that Gowdy's injury \"would not occur\" from the ladder step and also that it would have been \"unlikely\" to occur from the ladder step. And he commented that \"Mr. Gowdy's Charcot ... pre-dated the alleged event,\" whereas Dr. Clause's records reflected otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   We emphasize that for Jones Act negligence, proximate causation is not required.
