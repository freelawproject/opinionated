In 2012, after more than 10 years in that position, he became suspicious about the city's accounting and budgeting practices. He worried Jon Hanken, the city manager, was hiding something; he believed Hanken was suspiciously defensive about the budget, improperly delayed paying invoices at the end of the fiscal year and had weakened the city's external auditing process. Greisen discussed his concerns with various city council members and others in city government over the following year. In the summer and fall of 2013, Hanken initiated three investigations of Greisen, suspended him, placed him on an indefinite leave and prevented him from speaking publicly, even as Hanken was releasing information about the investigations to the media. After a city review committee recommended retraction of Greisen's suspension, Hanken resigned. Hanken's replacement subsequently fired Greisen, who has since been unable to find work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Greisen sued under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , alleging Hanken violated the First Amendment by subjecting him to adverse employment actions in retaliation for his protected speech. A jury found in Greisen's favor, and Hanken appeals.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We affirm. We hold: (1) Greisen provided sufficient detail about his speech to establish that it substantially involved a matter of public concern; (2) Greisen spoke as a private citizen rather than a public employee; (3) the district court properly concluded that Greisen's retaliation claim could be based in part on Hanken's own speech acts, in the form of defamatory communications to the media; (4) Hanken waived his argument that his actions were supported by an adequate justification; and (5) sufficient evidence supports the conclusion that Hanken's retaliatory actions proximately caused Greisen's termination, and any error in instructing the jury on proximate cause was harmless. We further hold Hanken is not entitled to qualified immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Jon Hanken, the former city manager of Scappoose, was responsible for overseeing the city's budget and for annually submitting a budget to the city council for review.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   According to City Councilor Judi Ingham, Hanken generally submitted his budget to the council soon before the beginning of the budget process, allowing little time for review, and he was defensive about issues relating to the budget. In mid-2012, the city had a particularly contentious budget approval process during which some city councilors advocated unsuccessfully for a budget that would add a police officer to the force. Although Hanken had told Chief of Police Doug Greisen to support the budget at the hearing, Greisen voiced neither support nor dissent. The next day, Hanken told Greisen: \"I'm mad at you. You stay on your side of City Hall. I don't want to see you over here.\" Greisen understood this as an admonition\n   to focus solely on the police department, and to leave the overall city budget to Hanken.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Greisen then learned the city delayed paying police department invoices, sometimes for as long as four months, before the end of the fiscal year on July 1. He became suspicious Hanken was hiding something, and he began asking \"a lot of\" other people, including the city finance administrator, city councilors and other city department heads, about the city's budgeting practices during the remainder of 2012 and early 2013. He learned the city was withholding payment on invoices from other departments as well. He also learned the city had transitioned from a four-person, on-site auditing team to a one-person, off-site auditing firm, and he was concerned about the differences between the firms: by contrast to the first auditing team, he found that the new auditor was less diligent, was unable to state an opinion on the city's finances and followed different practices that he worried were inconsistent with generally accepted accounting principles. He discussed this issue with the city finance administrator and city councilors. He also took a college course on government budgeting and financial management.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Around August 2012, Greisen tried to meet with Hanken to discuss the budget. Hanken was not receptive; he told Greisen that \"Ms. Ingham will be the one that will ruin your career here in the City of Scappoose.\" He also said Greisen \"didn't know what [he was] talking about\" when it came to budgeting and financial management.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In early 2013, Greisen was involved in a police pursuit during which he authorized an officer to perform a \"PIT maneuver,\" a method of stopping a fleeing car by bumping it with a patrol vehicle, sending the fleeing car into a spin. Although the maneuver was successful, another officer, Sergeant Doug Carpenter, wrote a memo to his lieutenant alleging it was executed at a high speed without proper procedure. Carpenter's criticism focused on the officer who actually performed the PIT maneuver, but it implicated Greisen's actions as well. The lieutenant forwarded the memo to Hanken, along with his own memo clarifying Greisen's role in the maneuver and recommending an investigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Hanken arranged for an outside public agency to investigate Greisen. The investigation's purpose, according to the investigator, was to determine \"whether or not there were policy violations,\" not to weigh whether a policy violation was justified. After interviewing various staff, the agency submitted a 25-page report finding Greisen committed 10 policy violations associated with the PIT maneuver.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Upon receiving the report, Hanken suspended Greisen for two weeks without pay. According to the report's author, the subject of such an investigation would \"typically\" have the opportunity to be heard after the report was complete, but Hanken\n   did not afford Greisen this opportunity. In his suspension letter, Hanken wrote: \"As I draft this letter, I cannot help but wonder if you would be able to maintain your position if this report was known by or reported to the news media.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Greisen appealed his discipline to the city's Personnel Review Committee (PRC), which absolved him of wrongdoing. The PRC characterized the outside agency's report as \"an erroneous mischaracterization of the events ... that also purposely omitted pertinent and material facts, to arrive at a conclusion that the PRC finds untenable, out of context and an egregious lack of professionalism.\" In the PRC's view, the outside agency's report was \"not an objective review, but a prosecutorial document that was colored to arrive at a predetermined result.\" The PRC further found that \"the degree of discipline issued to Police Chief Doug Greisen, for minor discrepancies of best practices, is entirely out of proportion based on the totality of the circumstances,\" and it recommended that \"the City Manager retract, and the Scappoose City Council oversee the retraction [of], all discipline issued to Chief Greisen.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   While the PIT maneuver investigation was ongoing, Hanken received another complaint about Greisen from Sergeant Carpenter, this time alleging Greisen had created a hostile work environment. In response, Hanken initiated another investigation by the same outside agency and placed Greisen on indefinite paid administrative leave pending the results of this investigation. Ultimately, the investigation concluded the allegations were not supported by substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In September 2013, while Greisen remained on leave, Hanken informed him the city would conduct a third investigation into his activities. This investigation charged Greisen with unauthorized financial practices relating to $ 2,500 in donations to the police department that Greisen kept in cash in his office. The investigation, conducted by the same outside agency, found five violations of city policy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Hanken sent letters to Greisen precluding him from speaking about the three investigations with anyone other than his wife and attorney. Hanken, however, released information about all three investigations to the media. In September 2013, soon after Greisen appealed his two-week suspension, Hanken released information about the first two investigations. He admitted at trial that his release of information about the ongoing second investigation \"wasn't appropriate.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Similarly, shortly before he resigned as city manager, Hanken spoke to the media about the third investigation, stating \"that a bank bag was discovered in the chief's desk and that its contents raised questions about whether the chief was maintaining an unauthorized account.\" Hanken also said that, \"[i]f any other officer had been caught using an unauthorized account, they would have been fired on the spot.\" He further provided the media with a photo of the cash that he admitted looked like a photo associated with a drug bust or money seizure. Hanken conceded at trial,\n   however, that others in the city knew about the money, that it was associated with authorized accounts and that he spoke to the press to ensure that the second and third investigations he had initiated were not discontinued.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On November 8, 2013, less than a month after the PRC issued its findings that Greisen's discipline for the PIT maneuver was unfounded, Hanken resigned, citing these findings as the reason. He was replaced by Donald Otterman in an interim capacity, and in early 2014 Otterman utilized a \"no-cause\" clause in Greisen's contract to terminate Greisen, who had not returned from administrative leave. Otterman made his decision after reviewing the investigator's reports and speaking with various people, whose views were highly polarized.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Greisen attempted to find other employment, but was unable to do so. A manager from another city who considered hiring Greisen testified that although he knew Greisen personally and respected him, he could not hire Greisen as police chief given the negative media attention he had endured.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   In 2014, Greisen filed this action. As relevant here, he brought a First Amendment retaliation claim against Hanken under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Before trial, Hanken moved for summary judgment on qualified immunity, and the district court denied the motion. The claim was tried to a jury, which found in favor of Greisen, awarding him $ 1,117,488 in economic damages and $ 3,000,000 in non-economic damages. Hanken filed post-trial motions seeking a new trial on the ground that the district court's jury instruction on causation was erroneous and seeking judgment as a matter of law on other grounds. The district court denied the motions, and Hanken timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We review de novo a district court's denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law, but \"[a] jury's verdict must be upheld if it is supported by substantial evidence, ... even if it is also possible to draw a contrary conclusion.\"\n   <em>\n    Pavao v.

He contends that this speech involved a matter of public concern - the mismanagement of city finances. He further contends that his discussions with city officials regarding suspected mismanagement were not part of his job duties, and hence that he engaged in this speech as a private citizen rather than as a public employee. He alleges a number of adverse employment actions - e.g., commencement of the PIT maneuver, hostile work environment and financial mismanagement investigations; the two-week suspension; the indefinite administrative leave; the \"gag order\" prohibiting him from speaking to the press; and the false and inflammatory information Hanken provided to the press about him - and he contends that his protected speech was a substantial or motivating factor in Hanken's decisions to take each of these actions. In addition, although he does not contend that Otterman's decision to terminate him was itself retaliatory, he seeks damages arising from the termination on the ground that it was proximately caused by Hanken's retaliatory actions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Hanken challenges the verdict in favor of Greisen on the first, second, third and fourth of the questions in the sequential analysis. In addition, he challenges Greisen's recovery of damages arising from the termination. We address these contentions in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   A number of Hanken's arguments also implicate qualified immunity. In resolving whether a government official is entitled to qualified immunity, a court \"must decide whether the facts that a plaintiff has alleged or shown make out a violation of a constitutional right,\" and, if so, \"whether the right at issue was 'clearly established' at the time of defendant's alleged misconduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Pearson v.

We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   We agree, of course, that a court must have sufficient information about the content, form and context of speech to determine whether it was on a matter of public concern. A plaintiff, however, need not provide transcriptions of the conversations. Here, Greisen provided enough. With regard to the\n   <em>\n    content\n   </em>\n   of the speech, Greisen testified about the discussions he had with the city finance administrator and other department heads regarding Hanken's practice of delaying payment of invoices. Greisen used these discussions, among other things, to learn about how other departments handled invoice payments. Greisen also testified that he discussed his concerns about the new auditor with some city councilors and with the city finance administrator. His concerns included the fact that the auditor was not on-site, the auditor's inability to offer an opinion about the city's finances and the quality of the auditor's written reports. As to\n   <em>\n    form\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    context\n   </em>\n   , Greisen provided a general timeline, identified the roles of his interlocutors and described his motivations for the discussions. The district court, therefore, had enough information before it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     The district court properly concluded the speech substantially involved matters of public concern\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Even assuming the information was sufficient, Hanken argues the district court erred by concluding that Greisen's speech substantially involved matters of public concern. He argues that, even if \"the content of the speech does at first glance look like it raises a public concern because it involves the city's finances,\" \"the form and context suggest that the speech is really about a power struggle between plaintiff and defendant - more specifically, about a power play by plaintiff.\" Hanken maintains that Greisen's speech \"was more like the airing of an internal grievance, the grinding of a private ax, not [an] effort to provoke a public debate on an issue of public concern.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   The evidence does not support this contention. It shows that Greisen was interested in uncovering mismanagement involving city funds. He spoke to other city officials to learn about the financial management process. He took a college course on budgeting and finance. His interest in the welfare of the city is clear from the record. His family had lived in Scappoose for 30 years, and he \"was very involved in the community,\" where he had \"volunteered endlessly.\" He also testified he was motivated by \"the cop in [him]\" to investigate whether something was being hidden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   That Greisen spoke privately to other city officials, rather than publicly, does not show that he was motivated by a private grudge rather than a desire to detect and expose potential mismanagement. The choice \"to convey ... views privately rather than publicly is not determinative of whether ... expression is entitled to protection.\"\n   <em>\n    Thomas v.

Here, Greisen's concerns related to ferreting out \"corruption or systemic\n   abuse\" in city finances and management, and these functions were not part of his official duties as chief of police. His concerns about the budget related to secrecy and potential wrongdoing: a lack of oversight on the part of the new auditor, Hanken's unwillingness to let anyone into the budgeting process and the failure to pay vendors on time. No evidence suggests these matters fell within Greisen's regular job duties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   With regard to the last factor (contravention of supervisors), there is strong evidence that Hanken, Greisen's supervisor, did not want him discussing or looking into the overall city budget or Hanken's accounting practices.

Hanken points to Otterman's testimony that his decision was based on the results of the three investigations Hanken initiated. There is some reason to doubt that these investigations were independent. Hanken selected the outside agency that performed the investigations, and, more strikingly, he admitted at trial that when he learned that the city council was considering ending the investigations, he made a false report to the media in a seemingly successful effort to keep them going.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Even assuming, however, that the investigations were fully independent and that Hanken cannot be held responsible for what they uncovered,\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lakeside-Scott\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3329859\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/556/797/#p804\">\n    556 F.3d at 806-07\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , they are not the whole story. Otterman acknowledged that there were \"some other things\" motivating his decision, including the negative media attention surrounding Greisen and the fact that \"the police department employees felt that they could no longer rely on ... Greisen as the chief of police.\" Hanken's wrongful actions - which amounted to a campaign of public humiliation through, among other things, false and misleading representations - almost certainly played a direct and substantial role in creating or exacerbating these conditions. Otterman did not assert that he made any effort to shield his termination decision from the influence of Hanken's actions.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Poland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6047191\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/494/1174/#p1182\">\n    494 F.3d at 1183\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And there is no contemporaneous evidence that Otterman's decision was based solely on the investigation results. On the contrary, rather than identifying a particular justification for the dismissal - like the employer did in\n   <em>\n    Lakeside-Scott\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3329859\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/556/797/#p804\">\n    556 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   809 - he concluded \"that the best situation for the City was to exercise the, quote, 'no-cause,' unquote, clause\" in Greisen's contract. Otterman further made clear that Hanken's actions created an environment of unrest that framed and dictated the timeline of the decision:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-93\">\n   There were several articles about [Greisen] and about what was going on in the City. ... The police chief was on administrative leave. And that causes commotion or turmoil in the organization and needs to be resolved as soon as possible.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   On this evidence, a reasonable jury could have found that Hanken's actions were a causal factor in Otterman's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n    <em>\n     Any error in the jury instruction on proximate cause was harmless\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   As noted, Hanken argues he is entitled to a new trial because jury instruction number 17 misstated the law of proximate cause by failing to require a direct relation between Hanken's actions and Greisen's termination. In relevant part, that instruction stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-97\">\n   You can award money only for those damages that arise naturally and necessarily from the violation of law that the Plaintiff has proven. ...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-98\">\n   If you find that the Defendant wrongfully retaliated against the Plaintiff in violation of the Plaintiff's constitutional rights, and if you also find that it was reasonably foreseeable that such wrongful retaliatory conduct, if any, by the Defendant would render the Plaintiff unable to maintain either his position or his salary (either at the City of Scappoose or at another employer), then you may award the Plaintiff any non-speculative, foreseeable economic damages caused by the Defendant's wrongful retaliatory conduct.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   We need not determine whether jury instruction number 17 was erroneous because\n   any error was harmless.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dunlap v.

Even fully crediting Otterman's testimony, he acknowledged that the media attention and Greisen's recent reputation in the department - almost certainly influenced by Hanken's actions - played a role in his termination decision. Otterman further admitted that Hanken's actions had placed the city in turmoil, which he felt \"need[ed] to be resolved as soon as possible.\" He did not provide formal reasons for the termination but rather used a \"no-cause\" provision in Greisen's contract.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Lakeside-Scott\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3329859\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/556/797/#p804\">\n    556 F.3d at 809\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Nothing in his informal review process shielded Otterman from the influence of Hanken's actions. In sum, the evidence strongly suggests Hanken's actions were a causal factor in Otterman's termination decision, and thus it is more probable than not a jury would have so found.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Moreover, the instructions required the jury to find that any damages arose \"naturally and necessarily\" from Hanken's unlawful conduct. It would be illogical for a jury to find that Otterman's decision to terminate Greisen followed naturally and necessarily from Hanken's adverse employment actions, but nevertheless was unrelated to those actions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   We thus hold that any error in jury instruction number 17 was harmless because it is more probable than not that the jury would have reached the same result had it been instructed as Hanken argues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   <strong>\n    IV.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The district court properly denied Hanken's renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law and motion for a new trial.
