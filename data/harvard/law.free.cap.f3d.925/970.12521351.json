The Board's order concluded that Anderson violated the NLRA by failing to make contractually mandated contributions to the Contractors, Laborers, Teamsters and Engineers Health and Welfare and Pension Fund (\"CLT&amp;E Funds\") and the Training Fund of Local 571 of the International Union of Operating Engineers (\"Union\"). Anderson cross-petitions for review of the Board's order, arguing that the Board erred in failing to find that the Union's unfair labor practice charge against it was time-barred. The Board responds that the Union's charge was timely filed within six months of Anderson's clear and unequivocal repudiation of its collective bargaining obligations. We deny Anderson's petition and grant the Board's application for enforcement of its order.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I.\n   <em>\n    Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Anderson is a construction company based in Omaha, Nebraska, established by Virgil Anderson (\"Virgil\"). Virgil and his wife, Virginia Anderson (\"Virginia\"), co-own the company. The Union represents heavy equipment operators. It negotiates collective bargaining agreements (CBA or CBAs) on their behalf with a group of large construction employers in Omaha.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Smaller employers, such as Anderson, may then adopt those CBAs. The CBAs set the employees' terms and conditions of employment. The CBAs also require employers to make contributions to several benefit funds and withhold and remit dues to the Union.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Anderson has been a signatory to CBAs with the Union for many years. In 1996, Anderson executed a Heavy Highway Agreement with the Union. The agreement contained a recognition clause explicitly acknowledging the Union as the exclusive collective bargaining representative of the employees in the bargaining unit described in the agreement. In 2004, Anderson executed another Heavy Highway Agreement with the Union.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   After the 2004 Heavy Highway Agreement expired in 2006, it was superseded by CBAs covering the periods 2006-2008, 2008-2010, 2010-2012, 2012-2014, and 2014-2018. The Union negotiated each CBA with a group of large construction employers in the Omaha area. Following the ratification of each CBA, the Union sent a one-page document to all signatories to complete. Anderson has not signed or returned any of these documents since 2004. Thus, the 2004 Heavy Highway Agreement was the last CBA that Anderson executed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Nevertheless, Anderson continued adhering to the CBAs. First, Anderson sought and received employee referrals from the Union's hiring hall. Second, it paid employees in accordance with the CBAs. Third, Anderson made the contributions required by the CBAs on behalf of its employees to the CLT&amp;E Funds\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and Training Fund. Fourth, Anderson regularly submitted reports signed by Virginia in her capacity as Anderson's president.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   These reports contained a certification that the funds were being paid on behalf of employees who had performed work covered by a CBA between Anderson and the Union. Fifth, Anderson remitted employee dues to the Union in accordance with the amounts required under each agreement and submitted corresponding reports signed by Virginia.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In 2010, the CLT&amp;E Funds audited Anderson and found that it owed the CLT&amp;E Funds $ 2,612.14. Anderson remitted this amount to the CLT&amp;E Funds. In 2013, the CLT&amp;E Funds conducted another audit. It determined that Anderson failed to make contributions for certain employees who had, in the CLT&amp;E Funds' opinion, performed work covered by the relevant CBA. The audit found Anderson $ 83,000 in arrears.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On March 25, 2014, the CLT&amp;E Funds and the Union filed suit against Anderson in federal district court under the Labor Management Relations Act to recover the arrearage.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Complaint,\n   <em>\n    Marshall v. Anderson Excavating &amp; Wrecking Co.\n   </em>\n   , No. 8:14-CV-96 (D. Neb. March 25, 2014), ECF No. 1. The complaint alleged that Anderson executed the 2004 Heavy Highway Agreement with the CLT&amp;E Funds and the Union and agreed to be bound by trust agreements requiring contributions to the CLT&amp;E Funds. In its answer filed on May 16, 2014, Anderson \"admit[ted] it reported hours and made employer contributions to the [CLT&amp;E Funds].\" Defendant Anderson Excavating Co.'s Answer and Affirmative Defenses at 2, \u00b6 9,\n   <em>\n    Marshall v. Anderson Excavating &amp; Wrecking Co.\n   </em>\n   , No. 8:14-CV-96, (D. Neb. May 16, 2014), ECF No. 10. Anderson also set\n   forth the affirmative defense that \"[t]he [CBA] the action is based upon terminated on April 30, 2006, and is therefore no longer a valid agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 3. Anderson also relied on the additional affirmative defense that Anderson \"is not a party to the Trust Agreements, and is not bound by the same.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In its Rule 26(f) discovery report\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   filed on June 17, 2014, Anderson took the position that \"[e]mployees identified by the audit were improperly classified as operating engineers and were not performing covered work and are not covered by the [CBA] between Defendant Anderson Excavating Co., and the International Union of Operating Engineers, Local 571.\" Rule 26(f) Report at 3,\n   <em>\n    Marshall v. Anderson Excavating &amp; Wrecking Co.\n   </em>\n   , No. 8:14-CV-96 (D. Neb. June 17, 2014), ECF No. 13. The Rule 26(f) report also reiterated Anderson's affirmative defense that the CBA referenced in the complaint expired on April 30, 2006, and was no longer valid.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Despite its claimed defense, prior to and during the course of the litigation, Anderson remitted dues to the Union, made payments to the CLT&amp;E Funds and the Training Fund, and otherwise complied with the 2014-2018 CBA. First, Anderson continued remitting dues and submitting employer remittance reports signed by Virginia.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Second, Anderson continued making contributions to the Training Fund and submitted Training Fund Reports for all of 2014 and for January, February, and March 2015.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The reports contained the following certification signed by Virginia:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   I certify that the individuals identified on this report are employees of the company who, during the reporting period specified, performed work covered by a [CBA] between this employer and the applicable union. \"Employee\" is defined as any person performing work covered by the [CBA] between the employer and the union which agreement provides for payments to the IUOE Local 571 Training Fund on behalf of such employee.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Petitioner's App. at 271-287.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In addition, Anderson continued making contributions to the CLT&amp;E Funds and submitted CLT&amp;E Fringe Benefit Reports. The reports contained a signed certification from Virginia substantially similar to the one contained in the Training Fund Reports.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Petitioner's App. at 308-326.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Finally, when a new CBA went into effect in 2014, Anderson paid the new CBA's increased CLT&amp;E contribution amount, which increased from $ 3.65 to $ 3.95 per hour.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   On May 20, 2015, Virgil and Virginia gave depositions in the federal lawsuit. Both denied that they had any CBAs with the Union and stated that they were making payments to the union funds and remitting union dues based on an unspecified and unwritten agreement with their employees. The same month, following Virgil's and Virginia's depositions, Anderson stopped making trust fund contributions and remitting dues to the Union.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   On June 19, 2015, Larry Murray, the CLT&amp;E Funds Administrator, notified Virginia via letter that counsel for the CLT&amp;E Funds informed him of Anderson's position that it had no CBA relationship with the Union. Because Anderson had \"advised of the termination of the [CBA] obligations with [the Union],\" Murray explained that counsel instructed him \"that it is unlawful for these Plans to accept employer contributions or provide benefits pursuant to the Trust Agreements and Plan documents.\" Respondent's App. at 84. Murray stated that \"no further payments can lawfully be accepted or benefits provided.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Aaron Fichter, the Union's Business Manager, notified Union members that he, too, was \"advised that it is not lawful for [the CLT&amp;E Funds] to accept Anderson Excavating contributions or provide benefits pursuant to the Trust Agreements and Plan documents.\" Petitioner's App. at 355. Fichter explained the legal dispute between the CLT&amp;E Funds and Anderson and the resulting nonacceptance of contributions as based on Anderson's lack of a CBA and the inability of CLT&amp;E Funds to accept contributions from a non-signatory company.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   On July 16, 2015, the Union filed a charge with the Board alleging that Anderson violated the NLRA by denying it was bound by any CBA with the Union. It amended its charge on January 22, 2016. The amended charge alleged that Anderson violated the Act by withdrawing recognition from the Union and repudiating the parties' 2014-2018 CBA by stating it was not bound by the agreement and by failing to abide by its terms, including provisions requiring payments to the CLT&amp;E Funds and the Training Fund and the remittance of dues to the Union.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In November 2015, Anderson resumed making payments and remittances in accordance with the 2014-2018 CBA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On August 11, 2016, the district court concluded that Anderson was \"liable to the plaintiffs for delinquent contributions under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201145\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\" Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law at 22,\n   <em>\n    Marshall v. Anderson Excavating &amp; Wrecking Co.\n   </em>\n   , No. 8:14-CV-96 (D. Neb. Aug. 11, 2016), ECF No. 77. In reaching this conclusion, the district court found that Anderson \"manifested acceptance to each successive CBA by.... continuously pa[ying] hourly wage rates in accordance with each CBA, withh[olding] administrative dues in accordance with each CBA, and ma[king] contributions\n   to the [CLT&amp;E Funds and Training Fund] in accordance with the rates set forth in each CBA.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 13-14. The court also noted that Anderson \"asked for guidance on withholding administrative dues, sought referrals from the Union hiring hall, and complied with audits\" as further evidence Anderson \"manifest[ed] its acceptance to each of the CBAs succeeding the 2004 CBA.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On August 19, 2016, the administrative law judge (ALJ) concluded Anderson \"violated Section 8(a)(5) and (1) [of the NLRA] in withdrawing recognition from the Union and repudiating its collective bargaining obligations,\" \"is bound by the 2014-2018 Heavy Highway Agreement,\" and \"violated Section 8(a)(5) and (1) [of the NLRA] by repudiating the terms and conditions of the 2014-2018 [CBA].\"\n   <em>\n    Anderson Excavating Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%204426389\">\n    2016 WL 4426389\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (italics omitted). The ALJ rejected Anderson's argument that the Union's charge against it was \"time barred because the Union was on notice that [Anderson] was withdrawing recognition as of May 2014 when it filed its Answer to the Union's District Court complaint.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%204426389\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The ALJ found \"that the Union did not have clear and unequivocal notice of ... Anderson's withdrawal of recognition and repudiation of its collective bargaining obligations until May 2015.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .

To remedy Anderson's violations, the Board ordered Anderson to cease and desist from the unfair labor practices found. It also ordered Anderson to cease and desist from interfering with, restraining, or coercing employees in the exercise of their rights under Section 7 of the NLRA. And, the Board ordered Anderson to recognize the Union as the exclusive collective bargaining representative of its bargaining unit employees and to honor and comply with the 2014-2018 Heavy Highway Agreement. Finally, the Board ordered Anderson to make employees whole for any monetary losses they may have suffered as a result of Anderson's repudiation of the 2014-2018 Heavy Highway Agreement, including any adverse tax consequences of receiving a lump-sum backpay award; make any payments to the CLT&amp;E Funds and Training Fund that it had failed to make since May 20, 2015; reimburse the Union for dues it had failed to remit; and post a remedial notice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   II.\n   <em>\n    Discussion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Anderson challenges the Board's order, arguing that (1) the Union's July 16, 2015 unfair labor practice charge was untimely; (2) Virgil's and Virginia's deposition testimony in the federal lawsuit improperly served as the basis for the unfair labor practice charge; and (3) any of Anderson's conduct that could be construed as an unfair labor practice arose because of the Union's actions, threats, or inducements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   \"We review the Board's findings of fact for substantial evidence on the record as a whole, that is, for such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a finding.\"\n   <em>\n    Cellular Sales of Mo., LLC v.

Notably, when Anderson submitted contributions to the CLT&amp;E Funds and the Training Fund, its reports contained a signed certification by Virginia indicating that the employees \"performed work covered by a [CBA] between this employer and the applicable union.\" Petitioner's App. at 271-287, 308-326.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Anderson's submission of \"all the requisite payments and remittances to the Union and the Trust Funds [continued] until May 2015.\"\n   <em>\n    Anderson Excavating Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%204426389\">\n    2016 WL 4426389\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, it was not until May 2015-when Anderson ceased making payments and remittances-that Anderson's litigation position and conduct aligned. As a result, the Union's July 16, 2015 unfair labor practice charge was properly filed within the six-month statute of limitations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20160\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b).\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   B.\n   <em>\n    Deposition Testimony\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Anderson next argues that the Board erred in finding that Virgil's and Virginia's deposition testimony in the federal case could serve as the basis for the Union's unfair labor practice charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The record does not support Anderson's argument that the deposition testimony served as the basis for the charge. Instead, the Board found that \"even without relying on the depositions, the record establishes that [Anderson] violated Sec. 8(a)(5) by withdrawing recognition from the Union and by repudiating the terms of the 2014-2018 Heavy Highway Agreement.\"\n   <em>\n    Anderson Excavating Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=365%20NLRB%20No.%2063\">\n    365 NLRB No. 63\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%201434211\">\n    2017 WL 1434211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *1 n.2 (Apr. 20, 2017). As explained\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , Anderson's May 2014 answer and June 2014 Rule 26(f) report showed withdrawal of its recognition. Anderson then clearly and unequivocally communicated its repudiation by ceasing to make the required payments in May 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   C.\n   <em>\n    Inducement to Act\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Finally, Anderson argues that the Board erred in failing to find that the\n   Union induced its failure to pay in May 2015. Anderson contends the Union's declaration that it would refuse to accept payments based on Anderson's prior declaration that it was not bound by a CBA triggered its nonpayment. In support of its argument, Anderson references the letter that Fichter, the Union's Business Manager, wrote to Union members notifying them that the Union had been advised that it would be unlawful for the CLT&amp;E Funds to continue accepting contributions from Anderson based on Anderson's position that there was no CBA with the Union. But Fichter's letter also explained that \"[t]his is not the opinion of [the Union]; there is no record of a written termination of the [CBA] and/or collective bargaining relationship between Anderson Excavating and [the Union].\" Petitioner's App. at 355.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Therefore, we reject Anderson's argument that the Union somehow induced Anderson not to make contribution payments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   III.\n   <em>\n    Conclusion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Accordingly, we deny Anderson's petition and grant the Board's application for enforcement of its order.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-54\">\n    The CLT&amp;E Funds are composed of two trusts: a health-and-welfare trust and a pension trust.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-55\">\n    In approximately 2012 or 2013, Virgil retired, and Virginia, his wife, began operating Anderson.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-56\">\n    Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \"26(f) requires that the attorneys of record arrange a conference, outline a discovery plan, and submit the discovery plan to the court in the form of a written report within 14 days.\"\n    <em>\n     Siems v.
