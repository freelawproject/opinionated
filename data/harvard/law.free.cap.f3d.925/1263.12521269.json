Am. Compl. \u00b6 36. According to the amended complaint, the defendants further this scheme by publishing the content of scam locksmiths' websites, translating street-address and area-code information on those websites into map pinpoints, and allegedly publishing the defendants' own original content. The district court dismissed the amended complaint as barred by the Communications Decency Act, which states that \"[n]o provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20230\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1).

The plaintiffs operate businesses that provide legitimate locksmith services.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   They face competition from \"scam\" locksmiths who misrepresent their businesses in terms of \"services offered, pricing, expertise, training, who is behind the website, their location, contact information, and whether they are licensed or registered to do business.\" Am. Compl. \u00b6 57.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   According to the plaintiffs, the internet allows scam locksmiths to amplify their influence. Consumers typically call locksmiths when they are locked out of their homes or cars. In emergencies of this kind, consumers prioritize identifying the locksmith closest to where they are located. Today, the \"primary means\" that an inquiring consumer uses to find a nearby locksmith is \"[l]ocation-based internet search.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6 54.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Both the importance of proximity and the internet's potential to create the facade\n   of proximity are not lost on scam locksmiths. These companies actively cultivate online presences that give the appearance of locality. Scam locksmiths \"publish hundreds or thousands of unique websites targeting nearly every heavily populated geographic location all around the country.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6 57. These pages \"display either a fictitious or no address, and include false claims that [scam locksmiths] are local businesses.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6 58. Moreover, scam locksmiths use call centers to generate \"local-area phone number[s],\" when in reality they may be located far away from the querying consumer.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6 59. All of these efforts are designed to take advantage of the structure of the defendants' search engines. By so doing, the scam locksmiths have \"tricked Google into displaying [scam locksmiths] as physical stores in [the consumers'] neighborhoods, when in reality, they're ghosts.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6 61B (internal quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Legitimate locksmith businesses have suffered significant economic losses due to competition from scam locksmiths.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6\u00b6 42-43. Yet the plaintiffs focus their blame not on the scam locksmiths themselves, but rather on the search engines that Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo! operate. Collectively, these companies control approximately 90% of the online search market.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6 33. According to the plaintiffs, the defendants use their market power with respect to online search to extract payments from legitimate locksmith companies like themselves. The defendants do this by \"deliberately flood[ing] their own organic and map results with locksmith listings they know are seriously inaccurate or even nonexistent to induce both legitimate and scam locksmiths to participate in paid [advertised] results to overcome the false information.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6 66.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The amended complaint alleges that the defendants carry out this scheme by publishing three kinds of content that boost scam locksmith search results and generate advertising revenue. (As discussed below, the plaintiffs also contend that these kinds of content are unprotected by the Communications Decency Act.) First, the defendants publish \"[t]hird-party websites created by scam locksmith[s] that Defendants know do not exist at the addresses stated thereon.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6 63. Second, the defendants publish \"[e]nhanced content that was derived from third-party content, but has been so augmented and altered as to have become new content.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 62. Finally, the defendants publish \"original content, created out of whole cloth.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Taken together, the defendants' publication of these categories of content has \"severely restricted\" consumers' ability to \"discover and contact Plaintiffs and other legitimate locksmiths.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In January 2017, the plaintiffs filed their amended complaint alleging eight violations of federal and state law.

Compl. \u00b6 62. The primary form of \"enhanced\" content to which the plaintiffs object is the defendants' creation of map pinpoints that display scam-locksmith locations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   The first question we must address is whether the defendants' translation of information that comes from the scam locksmiths' webpages -- in particular, exact street addresses -- into map pinpoints takes the defendants beyond the scope of \u00a7 230 immunity. In considering this question, it is helpful to begin with the simple scenario in which a search engine receives GPS data from a user's device and converts that information into a map pinpoint showing the user's geographic location. The decision to present this third-party data in a particular format -- a map -- does not constitute the \"creation\" or \"development\" of information for purposes of \u00a7 230(f)(3). The underlying information is entirely provided by the third party, and the choice of presentation does not itself convert the search engine into an information content provider. Indeed, were the display of this kind of information not immunized, nothing would be: every representation by a search engine of another party's information requires the translation of a digital transmission into textual or pictorial form. Although the plaintiffs resisted this conclusion in their briefs,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Locksmiths' Reply Br. 3 (declaring that the \"location of the inquiring consumer ... is determined entirely by the search engines\"), they acknowledged at oral argument that a search engine has immunity if all it does is translate a user's geolocation into map form,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Recording of Oral Arg. at 12:07-12:10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   With this concession, it is difficult to draw any principled distinction between that translation and the translation of exact street addresses from scam-locksmith websites into map pinpoints. At oral argument, the plaintiffs could offer no distinction, and we see none. In both instances, data is collected from a third party and re-presented in a different format. At best, the plaintiffs suggested that a line could be drawn between the placement of \"good\" and \"bad\" locksmith information onto the defendants' maps.\n   <em>\n    See id.\n   </em>\n   at 12:43-12:58 (accepting that, \"to the extent that the search engine simply depicts the exact information they obtained from the good\n   locksmith and the consumer on a map, that appears to be covered by the [Act]\"). But that line is untenable because, as discussed above, Congress has immunized the re-publication of even false information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The next question is whether the translation of somewhat less-exact location descriptions is protected by the Act. This requires somewhat more discussion. The plaintiffs describe a situation in which the defendants create a map pinpoint based on a scam locksmith's website that says the locksmith \"provides service in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area\" and \"lists a phone number with a '202' area code.\" Locksmiths' Br. 8;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Locksmiths' Reply Br. 4-5. According to the plaintiffs, the defendants' search engines use this information to \"arbitrarily\" assign a map location within the geographic scope indicated by the third party. Locksmiths' Br. 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   We conclude that these translations are also protected. First, as the plaintiffs do not dispute, the location of the map pinpoint is derived from scam-locksmith information: its location is constrained by the underlying third-party information.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In this sense, the defendants are publishing \"information provided by another information content provider.\"\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kimzey v. Yelp!, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4355081\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/1263/#p1270\">\n    836 F.3d 1263\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1270 (9th Cir. 2016) (holding that Yelp's star rating system, which is based on receiving customer service ratings from third parties and \"reduc[ing] this information into a single, aggregate metric\" of one to five stars could not be \"anything other than user-generated data\"). It is true that the location algorithm is not completely constrained, but that is merely a consequence of a website design that portrays all search results pictorially, with the maximum precision possible from third-party content of varying precision.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Carafano v. Metrosplash.com, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9104618\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/339/1119/#p1125\">\n    339 F.3d 1119\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1125 (9th Cir. 2003) (\"Without standardized, easily encoded answers, [Matchmaker.com] might not be able to offer these services and certainly not to the same degree.\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Second, and also key, the defendants' translation of third-party information into map pinpoints does not convert them into \"information content providers\" because defendants use a neutral algorithm to make that translation. We have previously held that \"a website does not create or develop content when it merely provides a neutral means by which third parties can\n   post information of their own independent choosing online.\"\n   <em>\n    Klayman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5918365,4280918\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/753/1354/\">\n    753 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1358 ;\n   <em>\n    accord\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bennett\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12515912\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/882/1163/#p1165\">\n    882 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   1167 ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kimzey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4355081\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/836/1263/#p1270\">\n    836 F.3d at 1270\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that Yelp's \"star-rating system is best characterized as the kind of neutral tool[ ] operating on voluntary inputs that ...

And the Sixth Circuit has held that the \"automated editorial act[s]\" of search engines are generally immunized under the Act.\n   <em>\n    O'Kroley v. Fastcase, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6055447\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/831/352/#p355\">\n    831 F.3d 352\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 355 (6th Cir. 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   Here, the defendants use automated algorithms to convert third-party indicia of location into pictorial form.\n   <em>\n    See supra\n   </em>\n   note 4. Those algorithms are \"neutral means\" that do not distinguish between legitimate and scam locksmiths in the translation process. The plaintiffs' amended complaint effectively acknowledges that the defendants' algorithms operate in this fashion: it alleges that the words and numbers the scam locksmiths use to give the appearance of locality have \"tricked Google\" into placing the pinpoints in the geographic regions that the scam locksmiths desire. Am. Compl. \u00b6 61B. To recognize that Google has been \"tricked\" is to acknowledge that its algorithm neutrally translates both legitimate and scam information in the same manner. Because the defendants employ a \"neutral means\" and an \"automated editorial act\" to convert third-party location and area-code information into map pinpoints, those pinpoints come within the protection of \u00a7 230.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Finally, the plaintiffs allege that the defendants publish \"original content\" devoid of any third-party origination at all. Am. Compl. \u00b6 62. We have addressed some of this allegedly \"original content\" in the previous section. For example, the amended complaint frequently alleges that the defendants create \"false\" or \"fictitious\" addresses.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . \u00b6\u00b6 64, 174. But those allegations refer to the map pinpoints that the search engines generate in neutral fashion based on third-party information like area codes, and we have already concluded that the pinpoints are covered by \u00a7 230 immunity.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Elsewhere in the amended complaint, the plaintiffs allege that the defendants go further. According to the plaintiffs, the defendants \"manually alter their own algorithmic results to maximize profitability,\" untethered from either the information the locksmiths provide or the algorithms the defendants employ.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 116. But the plaintiffs do not discuss this allegation in their appellate briefs, and they have therefore forfeited it.\n   <em>\n    Williams v. Romarm, SA\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5900089,4280943\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/756/777/\">\n    756 F.3d 777\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 783 (D.C. Cir. 2014) ;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   FED. R. APP. P. 28(a)(8)(A).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Finally, the plaintiffs maintain that the defendants' algorithms place the same scam locksmith's map pinpoint in different locations, depending upon a consumer's location, in order to make that locksmith appear to be nearby. This allegation has the mirror-image problem of the allegation just discussed: it is made in the plaintiffs' briefs,\n   <em>\n    see, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , Locksmiths' Br. 18; Locksmiths' Reply Br. 5, but is not made in their amended complaint. It is therefore not relevant in reviewing the validity of the district court's dismissal of that complaint.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hurd v. District of Columbia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12275847\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/864/671/#p678\">\n    864 F.3d 671\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 678 (D.C.

In this vein, we reject the defendants' remarkable suggestion at oral argument that they would enjoy immunity even if they did in fact entirely fabricate locksmith addresses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Recording of Oral Arg. at 37:27-38:20. That assertion is plainly inconsistent with the scope of the immunity that Congress has conferred. If the defendants were to fabricate addresses, those addresses would not be \"information provided by another information content provider.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=47%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20230\">\n    47 U.S.C. \u00a7 230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (c)(1).
