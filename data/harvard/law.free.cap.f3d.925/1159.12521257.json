He possessed an old shotgun that might have been manufactured as early as 1915. Because firearms manufactured in or before 1898 do not qualify as \"firearms\" under \u00a7 922, Defendant argues that the district court erred by refusing to instruct the jury that, to convict, they had to find that Defendant knew that his firearm was manufactured after 1898. Defendant also raises a Confrontation Clause challenge to certain testimony. We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   At the time of his arrest in this case, Defendant was a felon, and law enforcement had authority to conduct warrantless searches of his car and residence. After the local police department received tips that Defendant had engaged in illegal activity, two detectives, Anthony Chavez and Matthew Concannon, conducted surveillance outside the house in the garage of which Defendant resided.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Concannon saw two vehicles, a Volvo and a minivan, parked in front of the house. Concannon also saw Defendant appear from the back of the property and walk to the street, where he opened the sliding door on the minivan's passenger side, climbed into the driver's seat, and moved the van a short distance down the road. Defendant left the van through the same door and returned to the house. At that point, Concannon ran the number on the van's license plate and learned that it belonged to Defendant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Several minutes later, Concannon saw Defendant re-emerge from the back of the house, accompanied by a man named Angel Vasquez and an unidentified woman. All three individuals got into the Volvo and drove away. Chavez and Concannon then searched the garage. They found, among other things, keys to the minivan and an ammunition belt containing four shotgun rounds. Concannon used the keys to open the minivan's locked doors. Next to the sliding door that Defendant used to enter and exit the minivan, Concannon found a shotgun on the floor. The ammunition found in the garage did not match Defendant's shotgun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Defendant's landlord arrived at the property during the search and confirmed that Defendant was the only person living in the garage. Because Defendant was a felon and because the detectives had found the ammunition and the shotgun, Chavez directed that Defendant be arrested. Officers arrested Defendant, Vasquez, and the unidentified woman that same day, and jailed Defendant. Four days later, while Chavez was transporting Defendant to a different jail, Defendant asked Chavez how much prison time he might serve. After Chavez responded, Defendant said that he had not intended to use the shotgun but, instead, wanted only to sell it or give it away.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Defendant went to trial on two counts of violating \u00a7 922(g)(1) -one for the shotgun and one for the ammunition. An agent from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (\"ATF\") testified that the shotgun could not have been manufactured before 1915, given certain engravings on the gun. The agent also testified that the shotgun's model and serial number indicated that it was likely manufactured in the 1920s. The government did not introduce any evidence that Defendant knew the gun's age. A different ATF agent, Daniel Thompson, testified about his interview of Defendant's landlord, who did not testify at trial. Other evidence established that, although only Defendant lived in the garage, the house's other occupants stored items there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   After the government rested, Defendant moved for acquittal. The district court denied his motion. The court also denied Defendant's request for an instruction that the government must prove that he knew that the shotgun was manufactured after 1898. The jury found Defendant guilty on the shotgun count but acquitted him on the ammunition count. Defendant then moved for a new trial, arguing that Thompson's testimony about his interview with the landlord violated the Confrontation Clause. The district court denied the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A.\n   <em>\n    The \"Antique Firearm\" Exception\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Defendant argues that the district court should have instructed the jury that, to find Defendant guilty, they had to find that he\n   <em>\n    knew\n   </em>\n   that his firearm was manufactured after 1898. For the same reason, he argues that the government presented insufficient evidence to convict him. We review de novo \"whether jury instructions omit or misstate elements of a statutory crime,\" and we review de novo\n   the sufficiency of the evidence.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Nevils\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4221363\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/598/1158/#p1163\">\n    598 F.3d 1158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1163 (9th Cir. 2010) (en banc) (internal quotation marks omitted).

Defendant does not dispute that his shotgun met \u00a7 921(a)(3) 's definition of a firearm. Yet he argues that the government was required to prove his knowledge that the shotgun lacked the antiquity that would have placed it beyond \u00a7 922(g) 's reach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Every circuit to address the \"antique firearm\" exception in the criminal context has held that the exception is an affirmative defense to a \u00a7 922(g) prosecution, not an element of the crime.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

In its closing argument, the government brought up the landlord's statement again: \"Special Agent Thompson testified that that interview with the landlady confirmed his suspicions, his knowledge, that it was defendant's gun and defendant's ammunition.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   1.\n   <em>\n    Presence of Error\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   We review de novo whether a Confrontation Clause violation occurred.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

The government does not dispute that the landlord's statements were testimonial and did not meet\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   's requirements. But the government argues that no Confrontation Clause violation occurred because it offered a summation of her statements to show their effect on Thompson, not for the truth of the statements. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The government's argument carries little weight for the following exchange:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   Q: Did your discussion with Ms. Ewen confirm your decision to arrest Mr. Benamor for the firearm and ammunition?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   A: Yes, it did.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In context, that answer implied that the landlord confirmed that Defendant possessed the shotgun and the ammunition. The government made that implication unmistakable during closing argument by\n   again emphasizing the landlord's statement. If the government's argument prevailed here, then \"every time a person says to the police 'X committed the crime,' the statement (including all corroborating details) would be admissible to show why the police investigated X. That would eviscerate the constitutional right to confront and cross-examine one's accusers.\"\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Indeed, a brief description might be even more harmful to\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   's principle than a verbatim recitation. \"With the language actually used by the out-of-court witness obscured, any clues to its truthfulness provided by that language-contradictions, hesitations, and other clues often used to test credibility-are lost, and instead, a veneer of objectivity conveyed.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5715886\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/649/1098/#p1109\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   The parties dispute what level of error would require reversal here. Defendant argues for harmless error, while the government argues that plain error applies because Defendant failed to renew his objection to Thompson's testimony.

To assess whether Thompson's testimony was harmless, we must consider \"a variety of factors, including whether the testimony was cumulative, the presence or absence of [evidence] corroborating or contradicting the testimony on material points, the extent of cross-examination, and of course, the overall strength of the prosecution's case.\"\n   <em>\n    Tuyet Thi-Bach Nguyen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3641777\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/565/668/#p673\">\n    565 F.3d at 675\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    United States v.

And the detectives found the shotgun in Defendant's locked minivan, after they observed Defendant entering and exiting the van right next to the spot where the shotgun rested on the floor. The evidence differed with respect to the ammunition: Defendant did not confess to owning the ammunition, it did not match the shotgun, and it was found in a common area of the house rather than in Defendant's locked vehicle. Indeed, the jury's decision to acquit on the ammunition charge shows that it likely did not rely on the landlord's statement, because both Thompson and the government, in closing argument, stated that the landlord said that Defendant possessed the gun\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   the ammunition. In sum, the testimony was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRMED.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
