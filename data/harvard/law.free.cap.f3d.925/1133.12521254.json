On this basis, we affirm the district court's dismissal of the Third Amended Complaint because, putting aside mere conclusory allegations, the complaint fails to make any claims of discrimination on the basis of sex cognizable under Title IX. We also affirm the dismissal of the remaining due process and state law claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Brandon Austin, Dominic Artis, and Damyean Dotson (collectively, the \"student athletes\") were basketball players on scholarship at the University of Oregon (the \"University\") in 2014. In March 2014, a female student accused the men of forcing her to engage in nonconsensual sex at an off-campus apartment. She reported the alleged sexual assault to the Eugene police department within a few days. When details of the alleged assault became public, in part because the local news published the police report in full, the campus erupted in protest. Although the Lane County District Attorney ultimately decided not to prosecute the student athletes, the University proceeded with a formal disciplinary process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Central to this case is the University of Oregon Student Conduct Code in effect at the time, which defined \"sexual misconduct\" to include penetration without explicit consent. (Other types of sexual activity contemplated by the Code are not at issue here.) The Code also defined \"explicit consent\" as \"voluntary, non-coerced and clear communication indicating a willingness to engage in a particular act,\" including \"an affirmative verbal response or voluntary acts unmistakable in their meaning.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Or.%20Admin.%20R.%20571\">\n    Or.

They opted for the simpler, more streamlined administrative conference. According to the complaint and the University's Special Choice of Resolution Form, the administrative conference procedure included notice of the character\n   of the accusations against each student athlete, a summary description of the types of processes available, and the range of possible penalties; access to the case file; the opportunity to review and respond to the investigative report including witness interviews; representation by an advisor, including counsel; and a neutral administrator as a hearing officer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Or.%20Admin.%20R.%20571\">\n    Or. Admin. R. 571\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -021-0205(1) (2006). The student athletes claim that the hearings deprived them of constitutionally required procedural safeguards.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The University's Director of Student Conduct &amp; Community Standards oversaw the hearing and found the student athletes responsible for sexual misconduct because they had violated the Student Conduct Code by \"engaging in penetration without explicit consent.\" The University suspended the student athletes for at least four years and until the female student is no longer enrolled at the University (but not longer than ten years). It also declined to renew their scholarships.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The student athletes brought this action against the University and various administrators, alleging several causes of action, including Title IX claims based on sex discrimination and due process violations. The district court dismissed the Third Amended Complaint with prejudice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <strong>\n    DISCUSSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    I.

Under\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   , we balance three factors: (1) the private interests subjected to official action; (2) the risk of an erroneous outcome and the \"probable value, if any, of additional or substitute procedural safeguards\"; and (3) the governmental interest involved, including fiscal and administrative concerns.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/#p335\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/#p335\">\n    at 334-35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/#p335\">\n    96 S.Ct. 893\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Nonetheless, they received \"the hallmarks of procedural due process\": notice and a meaningful opportunity to be heard.\n   <em>\n    Ludwig v. Astrue\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3884746\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/681/1047/#p1053\">\n    681 F.3d 1047\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1053 (9th Cir. 2012) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Guenther v.

Notice is not an issue here and nothing in the allegations supports a claim that the student athletes did not receive a meaningful hearing with the right to be heard. Importantly, they were represented by counsel and given a choice of a Special Administrative Conference or a Panel Hearing with a panel of students, faculty, and staff and the option to appeal. They signed a Special Choice of Resolution Form and chose the Special Administrative Conference. In doing so, they removed the possibility of expulsion and negotiated away a potential \"negative notation\" on their academic record, replacing it with a \"notation of finding of Code violation - unspecified.\" Because the student athletes were represented by counsel and negotiated the scope of sanctions, they can hardly be heard to complain about the administrative hearing's procedural safeguards. Under\n   <em>\n    Mathews\n   </em>\n   , a hearing need not include every procedure possible, nor is one entitled to a hearing of one's own design.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/#p335\">\n    424 U.S. at 333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12026449\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/424/319/#p335\">\n    96 S.Ct. 893\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"The fundamental requirement of due process is the opportunity to be heard 'at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.' \" (quoting\n   <em>\n    Armstrong v.
