The basis for these decisions is not any federal statute authorizing a private right of action for victims of foreign genocide, nor even any statute punishing foreign genocide under United States law. Rather, these decisions rest on a statute abrogating the jurisdictional immunity of foreign sovereigns from claims for unlawful takings of property. As a result, the district court must hear genocide claims against foreign sovereigns, but only to determine whether it has subject-matter jurisdiction over common-law tort claims for conversion and the like. Moreover, the plaintiffs bringing these genocide-based takings claims may recover neither for killings nor even for personal injuries, but only for the loss of their property. And the district court must adjudicate these claims-and thus effectively determine the scope of a genocide-without first affording the foreign sovereign an opportunity to provide redress, whether for genocide or conversion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Before allowing this remarkable scheme to proceed further, we should reconsider it en banc.

These decisions create a clear split with the Seventh Circuit, are in tension with decisions from the Ninth and Eleventh Circuits, disregard the views of the Executive Branch on a matter of obvious foreign-policy sensitivity, and make the FSIA more amenable to human-rights litigation against foreign sovereigns than the Alien Tort Statute (ATS) is to human-rights litigation against private defendants abetting the sovereigns. Moreover, they clear the way for a wide range of litigation against foreign sovereigns for public acts committed within their own territories. This includes claims not only for genocide, but also for the violation of most other norms of international human-rights law.

Here, several contextual considerations support the narrower reading.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   To begin, genocide is not about the taking of property. Rather, it involves the attempted extermination of a national, ethnic, racial, or religious group. A United Nations convention defines genocide as:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial, or religious group, as such: (a) Killing members of the group; (b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; (c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide art. 2, Dec. 9, 1948, 78 U.N.T.S. 277.\n   <em>\n    Simon I\n   </em>\n   reasoned that takings may have a genocidal intent, and thus meet the last prong of this definition.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12309985,4085510\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/812/127/\">\n    812 F.3d at 143-44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But they still must be intended to cause the \"physical destruction\" of a group-what matters is the attempted mass murder. And if genocide involves attempted mass murder, a provision keyed to \"property taken\" would be a remarkably elliptical way of addressing it.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Whitman v.

Moreover, the expropriation exception requires a connection between the property taken and commercial activity in the United States: the property or its proceeds must either be \"present in the United States in connection with a commercial activity carried on in the United States by the foreign state,\" or \"owned or operated by an agency or instrumentality of the foreign state\" that is itself \"engaged in a commercial activity in the United States.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201605\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 1605(a)(3).

Moreover, the logic for requiring exhaustion is even stronger in the context of actions filed in domestic courts; \"if exhaustion is considered essential to the smooth operation of international tribunals whose jurisdiction is established only through explicit consent from other sovereigns, then it is all the more significant in the absence of such explicit consent to jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    Sarei\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5741836\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/550/822/#p828\">\n    550 F.3d at 830\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (plurality opinion).

Statutes of limitation may bar some claims arising from World War II, despite inevitable tolling or concealment arguments, but they will have no effect on claims arising from recent alleged human-rights abuses.

Under\n   <em>\n    Simon I\n   </em>\n   's broad interpretation of the expropriation exception, most modern ATS claims could be recast as FSIA ones. And after\n   <em>\n    Philipp\n   </em>\n   , recasting has significant advantages. For example, ATS claims that a defendant had abetted crimes against humanity by Papua New Guinea must be exhausted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Sarei\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5741836\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/550/822/#p828\">\n    550 F.3d at 824\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (plurality opinion). Yet under\n   <em>\n    Philipp\n   </em>\n   , the same lawsuit would face no exhaustion requirement if filed directly against Papua New Guinea. ATS claims of abetting atrocities committed by a foreign sovereign within its own territory are impermissibly extraterritorial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Kiobel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697039\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/108/#p133\">\n    569 U.S. at 111-12, 124-25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12697039\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/569/108/#p133\">\n    133 S.Ct. 1659\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Yet under\n   <em>\n    Philipp\n   </em>\n   , the same lawsuits, if filed directly against the foreign sovereigns, might survive on the theory that common-law tort claims have no territorial limit.\n   <em>\n    Compare\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mujica\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4292094\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/771/580/\">\n    771 F.3d at 591-96\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (dismissing ATS claims as extraterritorial),\n   <em>\n    with\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4292094\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/771/580/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4292094\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/771/580/\">\n    at 596-615\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (dismissing state-law claims only on comity grounds). Such results are perverse, for FSIA actions against foreign sovereigns raise even greater foreign-policy concerns than do ATS actions against private parties who may abet them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   <em>\n    Finally\n   </em>\n   , the mismatch noted above between jurisdictional and merits issues under\n   <em>\n    Simon I\n   </em>\n   makes exhaustion even more important. If the federal courts must resolve the scope of a genocide in order to decide garden-variety conversion claims,\n   then so much the better if the foreign sovereign can perhaps resolve the claims by addressing only the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   * * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   For these reasons, I would grant rehearing en banc to reconsider the approach to the FSIA's expropriation exception set forth in\n   <em>\n    Simon I\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Philipp\n   </em>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Simon II\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
