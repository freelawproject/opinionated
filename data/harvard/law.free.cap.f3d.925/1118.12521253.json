The two countries made minor amendments in 1935, adding more extraditable crimes and offenses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Supplementary Extradition Treaty, Apr. 29, 1935, U.S.-Czech.,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=49%20Stat.%203253\">\n    49 Stat. 3253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (U.S.T.

Article VIII provides an exception to the general mandate: \"neither of the High Contracting Parties shall be bound to deliver up its own citizens.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Knotek was born in the former Czechoslovakia and, around 1977, he fled his home country to seek refuge on the basis of his anti-Communist political opinion. Knotek was granted refugee status in the United States, and he later naturalized as a U.S. citizen in 1985.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In 1999, while in Prague, Knotek was arrested on allegations that he had attempted to extort representatives from local companies in two separate schemes. In March 2001, the Prague Municipal Court found Knotek guilty of two attempts of\n   criminal extortion in violation of the Czech Criminal Code sections 8(1) and 235(1), and imposed a sentence of five and a half years' imprisonment, \"indefinite deportation\" from the Czech Republic, and a fine of 250,000 Czech Koruna (\"CZK\").\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On appeal, the High Court of Prague affirmed Knotek's conviction, but reduced his sentence to four years' imprisonment based on the lack of any prior convictions in the country. In June 2002, the Supreme Court of the Czech Republic rejected Knotek's extraordinary appeal. By that time, Knotek had left the Czech Republic.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In 2003, following Knotek's failure to pay the court-ordered fine, the Prague Municipal Court increased his sentence to four and a half years' imprisonment. The court also issued an arrest warrant. In 2010, the Czech Republic's Ministry of Justice formally contacted the U.S. Department of Justice to request Knotek's extradition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On August 30, 2013, the U.S. government sought and obtained from the magistrate judge a warrant for Knotek's provisional arrest. The magistrate judge granted the government's request and issued an order certifying Knotek as extraditable to the Czech Republic. To challenge the extradition order, Knotek filed a habeas petition in the district court, arguing that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203196\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3196\n   </extracted-citation>\n   is an unconstitutional unilateral amendment of the Treaty by the Senate and that his Czech conviction did not fall within the Treaty.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The district court denied the petition, concluding that\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203196\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3196\n   </extracted-citation>\n   is constitutional and that Knotek's attempted extortion conviction falls within the Treaty.

Such a conclusion, however, overlooks the plain language of the relevant text and legal principles discussed above.

We therefore conclude that section 3196 is a permissible act of Congress because section 3196 does not amend or conflict with the Treaty and Congress has authority to adopt domestic laws regulating extradition.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Valentine\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5722963\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/299/5/\">\n    299 U.S. at 18\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5722963\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/299/5/\">\n    57 S.Ct. 100\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   <strong>\n    2.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Knotek argues in the alternative that even if section 3196 is constitutional, it does not authorize his extradition based on the \"last-in-time\" canon of construction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Whitney\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3524633\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/124/190/#p194\">\n    124 U.S. at 194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3524633\" index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/124/190/#p194\">\n    8 S.Ct. 456\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that when a treaty and statute conflict, \"the one last in date will control the other\"). He argues that because the United States and Czech Republic made no changes to Article VIII of the Treaty in 2006-despite amending analogous clauses in 13 other pre-\n   <em>\n    Valentine\n   </em>\n   treaties-this reflects the two countries' intent to prohibit the extradition of their own citizens. Knotek relies on these other treaty amendments to show that the United States knew how to remedy the\n   <em>\n    Valentine\n   </em>\n   problem, but explicitly left Article VIII in place with the Czech Republic.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Knotek's argument, however, relies on the same flawed assumption-that section 3196 amends or conflicts with the Treaty as enforced in 2006, when it in fact does not. Moreover, nothing in the record surrounding the Treaty's revisions in 2006 indicates the United States' or Czech Republic's intention, one way or another, in keeping the language of Article VIII. Rather, the Senate Executive Report, \"Extradition Treaties with the European Union,\" indicates that the parties' concerns were to incorporate modern dual-criminality provisions, streamline the authentication and transmission of extradition documents, provide for temporary transfers, incorporate assurances against the use of the death penalty, and simplify the extradition process.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   It would be a different situation if the United States and Czech Republic had explicitly amended Article VIII to prohibit the extradition of their own citizens. This would render section 3196 inapplicable because the statute confers authority only \"[i]f the applicable treaty or convention\n   <em>\n    does not obligate\n   </em>\n   the United States to extradite its citizens to a foreign country.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%203196\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3196\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

Knotek was convicted of attempted extortion and sentenced to four and a half years of imprisonment under Czech Criminal Code section 235(3) for causing \"extensive damage\" of at least five million CZK. The U.S. federal counterpart for criminal extortion,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201951\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , carries a maximum sentence of 20 years' imprisonment.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 1951(a).

The documents submitted with the extradition request included: the decisions of the Prague Municipal Court, High Court of Prague, and Supreme Court of the Czech Republic; the 2003 sentencing order by the Prague Municipal Court; and, the 2004 arrest warrant for Knotek. These supporting documents confirm that Knotek was convicted of attempting to extort representatives from two companies, Teleaxis Praha (\"Teleaxis\") and Eurotel Praha (\"Eurotel\"), in two separate schemes throughout 1999.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   First, the Czech courts concluded that Knotek, along with co-conspirator Tat'ounova, had threatened to interfere with an advertising contract between Teleaxis and Eurotel. Tat'ounova was at the time director of the press department of Eurotel. Over four months, Knotek repeatedly communicated with a Teleaxis representative, Peter Kovarcik, demanding to be paid a commission of 2.5 million CZK or he would otherwise use his influence with Eurotel to prevent that contract from being signed. Through Tat'ounova, Knotek obtained Teleaxis' official copy of the signed contract,\n   thereby holding up the payment of a third invoice owed to Teleaxis. Tat'ounova repeatedly obstructed officials from the companies from meeting to discuss the withheld invoice and contract. When they were finally able to meet, the CEO of Eurotel, Edward Rockwell Kingman, received an inflammatory text message from Knotek attempting to discredit the Teleaxis representative, Kovarcik. Tat'ounova was promptly fired based on her relationship with Knotek.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The Czech courts also concluded that in a second scheme, Knotek had threatened the CEO of Eurotel, Kingman, to go public about a Eurotel product failure in exchange for a pay-off. Kingman reported the situation to the company's board of directors and eventually contacted the police, who obtained recordings of meetings between Knotek and Kingman during which Knotek demanded, in exchange for his information, at least $ 50,000 USD and an increase in contracts with a separate company in which he had interest. Shortly thereafter, Kingman lodged a criminal complaint against Knotek, who was taken into custody and eventually convicted of criminal extortion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Knotek argues that the conduct underlying his 2001 Czech conviction for both schemes cannot be characterized as criminal but, rather, tortious because the tactics he used qualified as \"hard bargaining\" at most and, therefore, do not support an extortion charge under U.S. federal law. It is true that extortion is more broadly defined under Czech law than U.S. federal law. Under Czech Criminal Code 235(1), extortion is defined as when a person \"forces another to do something, not to do something or to tolerate something by violence, the threat of violence or threat of other grave harm.\" Conversely, criminal extortion in the United States is defined as \"the obtaining of property from another, with his consent, induced by\n   <em>\n    wrongful\n   </em>\n   use of actual or threatened force, violence, or fear, or under color of official right.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"78\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201951\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1951\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (b)(2) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The United States recognizes a \"claim of right\" defense against economic fear-based extortion claims.\n   <em>\n    United States v.

With regard to the advertising contract between Eurotel and Teleaxis, Knotek insists that he believed he was entitled to the commission for negotiating the contract. This does not explain, however, why after the contract\n   was finalized, Knotek helped his co-conspirator withhold a copy of the contract from Teleaxis and block Eurotel's payment of Teleaxis's third invoice. This conduct evinces an intent beyond simply hard bargaining.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Villalobos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5888843\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/748/953/#p956\">\n    748 F.3d at 957-58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (concluding that the jury could have found the defendant guilty because the means used to obtain the property were unlawful and clearly wrongful under the circumstances). As for the second scheme, Knotek argues that he had the right to go to the press with the story and that his actions were in the context of contract negotiations. This overlooks the evidence from Eurotel's CEO and other witnesses, including a video recording of Knotek's actions, that show that his offered services were \"imposed\" and \"unwanted,\" rather than \"genuine services\" which the company sought.\n   <em>\n    Enmons\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11957338\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/410/396/#p399\">\n    410 U.S. at 400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11957338\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/410/396/#p399\">\n    93 S.Ct. 1007\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .
