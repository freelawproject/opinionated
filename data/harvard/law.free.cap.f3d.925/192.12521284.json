When Muhammad filed a negligence claim against his employer under the Federal Employers' Liability Act (\"FELA\"), the district court granted the employer's motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. The court concluded that Muhammad was injured \"upon navigable waters\" and was engaged in \"maritime employment\" and therefore that the Longshore and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act (\"LHWCA\") provided the exclusive remedy for his claim. Because we conclude, however, that Muhammad's injury did not occur \"upon navigable waters,\" as required by the LHWCA, we reverse and remand for further proceedings.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In May 2016, while Muhammad was employed by Norfolk Southern Railway Company as a carpenter in its \"bridge and building\" maintenance department, he performed maintenance work replacing railroad crossties on Norfolk Southern's South Branch Lift Bridge in Virginia. The Bridge crosses the Elizabeth River, which has been declared navigable by the U.S. Coast Guard, and the center span of the Bridge lifts upward to allow vessels to navigate under it. The train traffic crossing the Bridge primarily serves businesses to the west of the Elizabeth River, often traveling to the Portlock Railyard, which is landlocked and approximately a mile east of the River.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The work crew with whom Muhammad was working traveled to the South Branch Lift Bridge via truck, and their work never required the use of boats. While Muhammad was working on the Bridge on May 19, a portion of the walkway on which he was walking collapsed. He was able to avoid falling into the River but sustained serious injuries that have prevented him from returning to work.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Muhammad then commenced this action against Norfolk Southern under the FELA,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2051\">\n    45 U.S.C. \u00a7 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   <em>\n    et seq\n   </em>\n   ., claiming that Norfolk Southern's negligence caused his injuries. Norfolk Southern filed a motion to dismiss Muhammad's action, claiming that \"the court lack[ed] subject matter jurisdiction over [the] action and the LHWCA ha[d] exclusive jurisdiction.\" Granting the motion would benefit Norfolk Southern by limiting its damages exposure to the scheduled and specified amounts\n   provided by the LHWCA, which is a workers' compensation statute, as distinct from the unscheduled damages to which it was exposed by a negligence claim under the FELA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The district court granted Norfolk Southern's motion and dismissed Muhammad's complaint. In doing so, the court held that \"the LHWCA provides the exclusive remedy for [Muhammad's] claim\" and that it therefore \"[did] not have subject matter jurisdiction to proceed\" on Muhammad's FELA action. In holding that the LHWCA applied exclusively to cover Muhammad's injuries, the court concluded that the circumstances of the incident satisfied both the \"situs\" requirement of the LHWCA that Muhammad's injury be \"upon navigable waters\" and the \"status\" requirement that he be engaged in \"maritime employment.\" Relying on\n   <em>\n    LeMelle v.

It thus held that it did not have subject-matter jurisdiction and dismissed the action under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(1). This lack-of-jurisdiction conclusion was misplaced, however, as Muhammad's claim under the FELA indisputably invoked the district court's subject-matter jurisdiction under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=45%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2056\">\n    45 U.S.C. \u00a7 56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (conferring jurisdiction on district courts for FELA claims) and\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201331\">\n    28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (conferring jurisdiction on district courts for claims arising under the laws of the United States).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   To be sure, if Muhammad's injury was covered by the LHWCA, then that Act, as a workers' compensation law, would provide him with the exclusive remedy for his work-related injury.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20905\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 905\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a) (providing that the employer's liability for covered injuries \"shall be exclusive and in place of all other liability of such employer to the employee\");\n   <em>\n    In re CSX Transp., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11709857\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/151/164/#p171\">\n    151 F.3d 164\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 171 (4th Cir. 1998) (holding that \"LHWCA coverage is exclusive and preempts [the plaintiff] from pursuing an FELA claim\").

Prior to 1972, \"the [LHWCA] applied only to injuries\n   <em>\n    occurring on navigable waters\n   </em>\n   . Longshoremen loading or unloading a ship were covered on the ship and the gangplank\n   <em>\n    but not shoreward\n   </em>\n   , even though they were performing the same functions whether on or off the ship.\"\n   <em>\n    Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Ry. v.

In 1972, Congress obviated this anomaly by\n   amending the Act, inserting the parenthetical language in \u00a7 903(a) that expands the situs definition of \"upon navigable waters\" to include \"any adjoining pier, wharf, dry dock, terminal, building way, marine railway or other adjoining area customarily used by an employer in loading, unloading, repairing, dismantling, or building a vessel,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=33%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20903\">\n    33 U.S.C. \u00a7 903\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a), thereby \"extend[ing] coverage to the area adjacent to the ship that is normally used for loading and unloading.\"\n   <em>\n    Schwalb\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11329645\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/493/40/\">\n    493 U.S. at 46\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11329645\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/493/40/\">\n    110 S.Ct. 381\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Recognizing that this \"expansion of the definition of navigable waters to include rather large shoreside areas necessitated an affirmative description of the particular employees working in those areas who would be covered,\" Congress also added the \"maritime employment\" requirement as part of the 1972 amendments in order to limit its expansion of the Act shoreside.\n   <em>\n    Herb's Welding, Inc. v.

Because Muhammad's injury did not occur on a \"pier, wharf, dry dock, terminal, building way [or] marine railway,\" our inquiry must focus on whether his injury occurred in an \"other adjoining area.\" And in order for an \"other adjoining area\" to constitute a covered situs, \"it must be a discrete shoreside structure or facility\" that is \" 'customarily used by an employer in loading, unloading, repairing, dismantling, or building a vessel,' as the statute provides.\"\n   <em>\n    Sidwell v.

Norfolk Southern argues otherwise, asserting that a bridge allowing commercial navigation to travel underneath it provides a sufficient connection to \"navigable waters\" to support LHWCA coverage for injuries on that bridge. But the nexus to loading and unloading must not be so remote as to include any situs that is simply somehow\n   <em>\n    related\n   </em>\n   to navigable waters. Indeed, Norfolk Southern's argument would extend LHWCA coverage to injuries occurring on\n   <em>\n    every bridge\n   </em>\n   that allowed ships to pass under it. Congress clearly did not intend so broad a coverage. As the Supreme Court has noted, in enacting the 1972 amendments, Congress did not \"seek to cover all those who breathe salt air. Its purpose was to cover those workers on the situs who are involved in the essential elements of loading and unloading.\"\n   <em>\n    Herb's Welding\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11299444\" index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/414/#p423\">\n    470 U.S. at 423\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11299444\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/470/414/#p423\">\n    105 S.Ct. 1421\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In reaching the contrary conclusion that the South Branch Lift Bridge was indeed a situs covered by the LHWCA, the district court relied principally on two cases,\n   <em>\n    LeMelle v.

Thus, our statement in\n   <em>\n    LeMelle\n   </em>\n   , which the district court took out of context, referred to bridge work performed upon navigable waters insofar as the work was performed from barges, launches, and the like that were\n   <em>\n    actually on\n   </em>\n   navigable waters.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   And in\n   <em>\n    Zapata\n   </em>\n   , the employee was working as an airplane pilot for a commercial fishing company, spotting fish from the air to aid commercial fishing boats.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10541766\" index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/933/256/#p259\">\n    933 F.2d at 257-58\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because we concluded that \"fish spotting was traditionally an activity inherent to commercial fishing\" - citing expert testimony that, \"traditionally, crewmen would climb to the crow's nests of fishing vessels to spot fish\" - we concluded that the employee performing that traditional\n   fishing function was covered by the LHWCA.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id\n   </em>\n   . at 260.
