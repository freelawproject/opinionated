McGrath received a tip from a known informant that Nicholas Finley was selling methamphetamine from Room 131 of the Red Roof Inn in Greenville, South Carolina. Deputy McGrath was aware of Finley's reputation as a person involved with narcotics and firearms, and she knew that he was a convicted felon. On May 11, 2017, at approximately 4:30 p.m., she and another deputy drove to the Red Roof Inn to investigate the tip and see if there was any suspicious activity occurring there. Room 131 was located on the back side of the motel. The only car in the parking lot was in front of Room 131, and it had a fake paper tag. As Deputy McGrath was checking the VIN of the vehicle to see if it was stolen, Finley came to the door of Room 131, with a big gray pit bull at his side. Deputy McGrath recognized Finley and asked permission to enter the room. Finley agreed and put the dog in the bathroom.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   There were seven people inside Room 131, including Drummond, all of whom voluntarily produced identification. Deputy McGrath asked Finley if anyone else was present in the room, and Finley assured her that there was not. After checking the identifications provided by the occupants of the room, Deputy McGrath asked for Finley's permission to check the bathroom. He again consented. Aware that the dog was inside the bathroom, Deputy McGrath slowly opened the door. There she found a woman, who could not be identified at the time by the name given. There was an orange hypodermic needle cap near the woman's feet. Deputy McGrath asked the occupants of the room if anyone had a medical condition that would explain the presence of the needle cap. No one admitted to any such condition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   While her partner stayed with the occupants in the room, Deputy McGrath sought\n   a warrant to search Room 131, based on the following affidavit:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   The Affiant obtained knowledge that the occupant of this room, Nicholas Finley was selling Methamphetamine from room 131 at this motel. When I performed an extra patrol of this motel, I observed a suspicious vehicle parked in front of the motel room with a fake paper tag. As I walked up to the vehicle, Nicholas Finley began exiting the motel room. I observed multiple people inside the hotel room along with a large pit bull. As Nicholas put the dog in the bathroom, I asked if I could enter the hotel room and Nicholas stated I could. Due to the large amount of people in the room I asked to see identification and asked if anyone else was in the room. I was advised there was no one else. After checking everyone's identifications, I asked Nicholas if I could check the bathroom to ensure no one else was in the room. I found a female that could not be identified at this time by her name given and I observed an orange hypodermic needle cap on the floor next to her feet. No one in the room was a diabetic and could provide a reason for having this drug paraphernalia. I believe through the execution of this search warrant, more narcotics and paraphernalia will be located.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   J.A. 71. The magistrate issued the search warrant, which resulted in the discovery of firearms, ammunition, multiple baggies with methamphetamine residue, and various items of drug paraphernalia, including hypodermic needles.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In a backpack located near Drummond's feet, the officers found a Smith &amp; Wesson .38 caliber revolver, fully loaded with .38 caliber rounds, a Crown Royal bag containing additional .38 caliber ammunition, and job-related paperwork in Drummond's name. Drummond's fingerprints were subsequently found on the gun.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Drummond was charged with being a felon in possession of a firearm, in violation of\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20922\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g)(1). Prior to trial, he moved to suppress the evidence seized in the search, asserting that the search warrant was not supported by probable cause. The government argued that Drummond lacked standing to challenge the search of the motel room and that, even if he did have standing, the search warrant was supported by probable cause. The district court denied the motion to suppress. Drummond was subsequently convicted by a jury of the felon-in-possession charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Over Drummond's objections, the district court imposed an enhancement under the ACCA, based upon Drummond's three prior felony convictions in South Carolina for criminal domestic violence. Drummond received a sentence of 247 months' imprisonment. He appeals the district court's denial of his motion to suppress and the imposition of the ACCA sentence enhancement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   We begin with Drummond's appeal of his \u00a7 922(g)(1) conviction, which was based solely on his claim that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress. More specifically, Drummond contends that the affidavit prepared by Deputy McGrath was insufficient to establish probable cause for the magistrate to issue the search warrant. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The Fourth Amendment protects individuals from \"unreasonable searches and seizures,\" and provides that \"no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\" U.S. Const. amend.

She testified that this was because of the danger that the subject posed and the unwillingness of the tipster to be known. Contrary to Drummond's view, however, the affidavit for the warrant was not based solely on the informant's tip. The tip, coupled with Deputy McGrath's knowledge of Finley's drug-dealing reputation, led her to conduct the extra patrol of the motel in order to investigate the tip. This investigation, in turn, led to facts and circumstances that demonstrated probable cause to obtain the warrant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   First, the tip provided to Deputy McGrath was partially corroborated immediately upon the officers' arrival at the motel room. Finley walked out of the specific room identified by the informant as the place where drugs were being dealt. The only car in the lot was parked directly in front of the room and had a fake paper\n   tag. There were a large number of people in the small motel room in the afternoon hours. When Deputy McGrath asked for permission to enter the room, Finley consented, but put his pit bull in the bathroom. Finley then lied to the deputies about whether there was a person in the bathroom. After Finley consented to Deputy McGrath's request to check the bathroom, a woman was found sitting on the floor of the bathroom who could not be identified by the name given, and who had drug paraphernalia at her feet.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We hold that these circumstances, viewed in their totality, were sufficient to justify the magistrate's determination that there was a fair probability that evidence of methamphetamine distribution and additional drug paraphernalia would be found in the motel room. Accordingly, we affirm the district court's denial of Drummond's motion to suppress the evidence against him, and we affirm his conviction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Drummond next challenges the district court's enhancement of his sentence under the ACCA, which was based upon three predicate convictions for criminal domestic violence in South Carolina. One was for Drummond's third offense for criminal domestic violence (\"CDV\").\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=S.C.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2016-25-20\">\n    S.C.

An \"offer\" to commit physical harm is, at a minimum, a threat to do so.\n   <em>\n    See Threat\n   </em>\n   , Black's Law Dictionary (10th ed. 2014) (defining a \"threat\" as \"a declaration, express or implied, of an intent to inflict loss or pain on another\");\n   <em>\n    Offer,\n   </em>\n   Merriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary (10th ed. 1998) (defining an \"offer\" as including a \"threat\");\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

South Carolina law addressing the question of what constitutes an \"offer\" also likens it to a \"threat\" to engage in a prohibited act.\n   <em>\n    See e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mellen v.

In other words, there must be a threat to inflict physical harm or injury\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   circumstances sufficient to cause the victim to reasonably fear that the physical harm or injury will be done. This element closely parallels and more than satisfies the ACCA's requirement that there be a threatened use of physical force that is \"capable\n   <em>\n    of causing physical pain or injury\n   </em>\n   \" to the victim.\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12446767,3581927\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/133/\">\n    559 U.S. at 140\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12446767,3581927\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/559/133/\">\n    130 S.Ct. 1265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   C.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   The crux of Drummond's argument is that, notwithstanding the plain language of the CDV statute, a CDV conviction cannot categorically be deemed a violent felony because we have held that South Carolina's common law offense of assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature (\"ABHAN\") is not categorically a violent felony.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hemingway,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3717861\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/734/323/#p327\">\n    734 F.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   335 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    United States v.

Drummond argues that the minimum CDV offense is nothing more than a common-law assault offense inflicted upon a household member and, therefore, that we must reach the same conclusion here. The flaw in Drummond's argument, however, is that, unlike ABHAN, the statutory crime of CDV does not reference nor rely upon South Carolina's definition of assault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In South Carolina, common-law assault has historically \"been defined as an 'attempted battery' or an unlawful attempt or offer to commit a\n   <em>\n    violent injury\n   </em>\n   upon another person, coupled with the present ability to complete the attempt or offer by a battery.\"\n   <em>\n    State v.

As to the violent-injury element, the court noted that, despite the \"misleading\" language of the standard definition of assault, an assault conviction does not actually require violence or even serious injury; an actual or attempted \"touching of the person of an individual in a rude or angry manner\" will suffice.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 471 (internal quotation marks omitted). The court therefore concluded that the \"violent injury\" element of common-law assault did not require\n   <em>\n    more\n   </em>\n   than the \"physical harm or injury\" element of CDV. The court, however, did not address the separate question of whether the\n   <em>\n    CDV statute\n   </em>\n   required more than common-law assault in terms of the nature or degree of injury required to support a conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Thus, contrary to Drummond's proffered interpretation,\n   <em>\n    LaCoste\n   </em>\n   does not stand for the proposition that the only difference between CDV and simple assault is the identity of the victim,\n   <em>\n    i.e.,\n   </em>\n   a household member. That was not the issue before the court, nor does the opinion lead us to this conclusion. There was no issue in\n   <em>\n    LaCoste\n   </em>\n   regarding the marital status of the defendant and his victim. But because Mrs. LaCoste testified on her husband's behalf, denied that he struck her, and there was no evidence of physical injuries, the jury could have concluded that LaCoste's conduct rose to the level of a \"violent injury\" for purposes of an assault, but not to the level of \"physical harm or injury\" necessary to convict him of CDV.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Golston,\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3882106\" index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/399/393/\">\n    732 S.E.2d at 178\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that jury charge on lesser offense is warranted when \"the evidence viewed as a whole [is] such that the jury could conclude the defendant is guilty of the lesser offense\n   <em>\n    instead of\n   </em>\n   the indicted offense\"). In other words, while the threat of an offensive touching is a necessary predicate for a CDV conviction\n   <em>\n    and\n   </em>\n   an assault conviction in South Carolina, the threat of an offensive touching alone would\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   be sufficient for a CDV conviction, because the CDV statute additionally requires that the offensive touching be sufficient to cause \"physical harm or injury\" to the other person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The physical harm-or-injury element thus distinguishes CDV from common-law assault, making CDV the greater offense encompassing the lesser offense of assault. The same element also brings CDV within the bounds of a violent felony under the ACCA. Accordingly, regardless of the fact that common-law assault can be committed without causing injury, CDV is a different offense, and it requires at least a threat of physical harm or injury under circumstances reasonably creating fear of imminent peril. That satisfies the Supreme Court's definition of physical force under the ACCA, which means that South Carolina's CDV statute categorically qualifies as a violent felony under the ACCA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   D.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Although Drummond makes the same common-law-assault argument to all three of his CDV convictions, common-law assault was abolished as a criminal offense in 2010, when the South Carolina General Assembly passed an act making numerous changes to the criminal law, including the\n   creation of a new statutory scheme of criminal assault offenses.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Omnibus Crime Reduction and Sentencing Reform Act of 2010, Act No. 273,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20S.C.%20Acts%201937\">\n    2010 S.C.

Only Drummond's first offense - a CDVHAN offense committed in 2003 - was committed at a time when he could have been convicted of common-law assault. The other offenses (a third-offense CDV and another CDVHAN) were committed in 2012 and 2014, after the effective date of the statutory scheme. At the time of those offenses, the least-serious assault offense was third-degree assault and battery, which is violated if the defendant \"unlawfully injures another person, or offers or attempts to injure another person with the present ability to do so.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=S.C.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%2016-3-600\">\n    S.C.

Nonetheless, the analysis set out above resolves the question as to the later offenses as well. Regardless of the conduct that might be sufficient to support a conviction for statutory assault, the CDV statute requires the defendant to at least threaten to cause physical harm or injury \"with apparent present ability under circumstances reasonably creating fear of imminent peril.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=S.C.%20Code%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%2016-25-20\">\n    S.C.

Ct. App. 1999), the dissent contends that it makes no sense for the CDV statute to have created an offense that is harder to prove than common-law assault. Like Drummond, the dissent believes that the only difference between common-law assault and CDV is the identity of the victim. Accordingly, because common-law assault can be based on the threat of a rude or offensive touching, the dissent believes that a CDV conviction can be based on the threat of a rude or offensive touching of a household member. In our view, this argument fails to acknowledge or grapple with the actual language of the CDV statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   The CDV statute, which was passed at a time when common-law assault was a prosecutable crime in South Carolina, does not borrow the language of common-law assault, but instead uses a very different phrase requiring a defendant to cause or threaten to \"cause physical harm or injury to a person's own household member with apparent present ability under circumstances reasonably creating fear of imminent peril.\" S.C.

Hemingway\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3717861\" index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/734/323/#p327\">\n    734 F.3d 323\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (4th Cir. 2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   As the majority discusses, we have issued unpublished opinions concluding that CDV is categorically a crime of violence. Since those cases are not binding, I consider in the first instance whether CDV is a crime of violence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   I agree with the parties and with my colleagues in the majority that CDV should be analyzed using the categorical approach, as opposed to the modified categorical approach. Under that approach, we are to review the elements of the crime and discern \"the minimum conduct necessary for a violation under state law.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   <em>\n    United States v. Gardner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5917339\" index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/823/793/#p803\">\n    823 F.3d 793\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 803 (4th Cir. 2016) (internal quotation marks omitted). South Carolina Code \u00a7 16-25-20(A) states that an individual commits CDV when they \"(1) cause physical harm or injury to a person's own household member; or (2) offer or attempt to cause physical harm or injury to a person's own household member with apparent present ability under circumstances reasonably creating fear of imminent peril.\" The least culpable means of committing CDV is to \"offer ... to cause physical harm or injury to a person's own household member with apparent present ability under circumstances reasonably creating fear of imminent peril.\" Thus, the operative question is whether that conduct amounts to \"threatened use of physical force against the person of another ....\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20924\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(2)(B)(i). I would hold that the answer is no.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   Most CDV cases adjudicated by South Carolina state courts involve violent physical assaults that easily fall under the ACCA's force clause.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Chase\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"125\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2011%20WL%2011734321\">\n    2011 WL 11734321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (S.C. Ct. App. 2011) (affirming defendant's conviction of criminal domestic violence of high and aggravated nature where he choked and brutally assaulted victim). And there is good reason to conclude that the CDV statute does not encompass words uttered at a significant physical or temporal remove, no matter how vulgar or violent; in\n   <em>\n    State v. Hawes\n   </em>\n   , the South Carolina Court of Appeals held that recordings of a wife threatening to kill her husband and his new girlfriend were not evidence of CDV because \"the recordings do not indicate [the wife] had 'apparent present ability[,] under circumstances reasonably creating fear of imminent peril[,]' 'to cause physical harm or injury' to [her husband].\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3882049\" index=\"126\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/399/211/\">\n    399 S.C. 211\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3882049\" index=\"127\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/399/211/\">\n    730 S.E.2d 904\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 905 n.1 (S.C. Ct. App. 2012),\n   <em>\n    vacated on other grounds\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4079869\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/411/188/\">\n    411 S.C. 188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4079869\" index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/411/188/\">\n    767 S.E.2d 707\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   But there is a spectrum of conduct between the recordings the\n   <em>\n    Hawes\n   </em>\n   court refused to find as evidence of CDV and the brutal assault in\n   <em>\n    Chase\n   </em>\n   that easily satisfies the \"physical force\" contemplated by ACCA's force clause. It is in this murky middle ground that the \"most innocent conduct\" of an \"offer ... to cause physical harm\" exists. However, no South Carolina state court case discusses this conduct in the context of the CDV statute. For guidance, then, I turn to South Carolina's interpretation of similar language in the common-law crime of assault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Under South Carolina law, assault is \"an unlawful attempt or offer to commit a violent injury upon another person, coupled with the present ability to complete the attempt or offer by a battery.\"\n   <em>\n    State v. Murphy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"89712\" index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/322/321/\">\n    322 S.C. 321\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"89712\" index=\"131\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/322/321/\">\n    471 S.E.2d 739\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 741 (S.C. Ct. App. 1996). In\n   <em>\n    LaCoste\n   </em>\n   , the South Carolina Court of Appeals recognized that \"assault and subsection (2) of the CDV statute appear very similar,\" and went on to acknowledge that assault had been defined as \"any touching of the person of an individual in a rude or angry manner, without justification.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"214301\" index=\"132\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/347/153/\">\n    553 S.E.2d at 471\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    State v. Mims\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2166826\" index=\"133\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/286/553/\">\n    286 S.C. 553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2166826\" index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/286/553/\">\n    335 S.E.2d 237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 237 (1985) ). The\n   <em>\n    LaCoste\n   </em>\n   court discussed the inclusion of the term \"violent injury\" in the common-law crime of assault, reasoning that \"[t]he adjective 'violent' may be somewhat misleading,\" as assault and battery has also been defined as \"any touching of the person of an individual in a rude or angry manner, without justification.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2166826\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/286/553/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Mims\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2166826\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/286/553/\">\n    335 S.E.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   237 ). The\n   <em>\n    LaCoste\n   </em>\n   court concluded that \"[the CDV statute] merely includes the additional element that the person of another be a household member.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 472.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   As there are no South Carolina cases analyzing what an \"offer\" of \"physical\n   harm\" means in the context of a CDV conviction,\n   <em>\n    LaCoste\n   </em>\n   's analysis should guide our own. And although\n   <em>\n    LaCoste\n   </em>\n   does not speak with perfect clarity on the issue at hand, the most natural reading of the court's analysis is that under the CDV statute, an \"offer ... to cause physical harm\" includes an offer to touch a person in a rude or angry manner. We have already determined that \"rude or angry\" touching does not count as \"physical force\" within the meaning of ACCA's force clause.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hemingway\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3717861\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/734/323/#p327\">\n    734 F.3d at 369\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (holding that South Carolina crime of assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature is not a crime of violence because it could be committed even if \"no real force was used against the victim.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   Accordingly, I would hold that South Carolina CDV is not a crime of violence and remand for resentencing without the ACCA enhancement. In concluding the contrary, the majority makes two analytical errors. First, the majority's analysis assumes that South Carolina's definition of common-law assault has no bearing on the definition of \"physical harm\" in the CDV statute. But for the reasons just discussed, that assumption does not square with\n   <em>\n    LaCoste\n   </em>\n   . Moreover, the majority infers based on the facts of\n   <em>\n    LaCoste\n   </em>\n   , in which the jury heard evidence that LaCoste \"repeatedly struck a woman who identified herself as his wife,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3717861\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/734/323/#p327\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3717861\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/734/323/#p327\">\n    at 469\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , that CDV necessarily involves greater harm or injury than assault. However, that portion of the\n   <em>\n    LaCoste\n   </em>\n   decision responds to the defendant's argument that he was entitled to a directed verdict, and merely recites this testimony for the purpose of showing that there was sufficient evidence to submit the case to the jury.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3717861\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/734/323/#p327\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   It does not support the conclusion that the element of harm or injury in CDV offenses is categorically more severe than the element of injury in assault offenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   The majority's reading of a higher threshold of force into CDV offenses assumes a higher bar for obtaining a CDV conviction than an assault conviction, a result seemingly at odds with the \"essential purpose of the [CDV] statute ... to protect against harm and violence from members of an individual's household.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Arthurs v. Aiken Cty.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"147856\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/338/253/\">\n    338 S.C. 253\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"147856\" index=\"141\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sc/338/253/\">\n    525 S.E.2d 542\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 549 (S.C. Ct. App. 1999). I see no commonsense reason for South Carolina to try to protect people from violence at the hands of their own household by creating a statutory crime that is\n   <em>\n    harder\n   </em>\n   to prove than common-law assault. Yet the majority's analysis requires us to assume that South Carolina did just that. I cannot agree. For this reason and the reasons already stated, I cannot agree that CDV is categorically a violent felony under the ACCA.\n   <footnotemark>\n    *\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"*\">\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    The PSR indicates only three past convictions that would be \"violent felonies\" for ACCA purposes. Therefore, if CDV is not a crime of violence then Drummond would not have the requisite three predicate convictions to qualify for armed career criminal status. In the recent case of\n    <em>\n     United States v. Hodge\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12518441\" index=\"142\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/902/420/\">\n     902 F.3d 420\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (4th Cir. 2018) we held that the government must identify all of the convictions it wishes to use to support an enhanced sentence under ACCA at the time of sentencing, and may not preserve the ACCA enhancement upon resentencing with a prior conviction that was not designated as an ACCA predicate in the PSR. Accordingly, we need not determine whether CDVHAN is a crime of violence.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
