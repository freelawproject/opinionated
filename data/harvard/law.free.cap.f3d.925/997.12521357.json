At sentencing, the district court\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   determined that Robinson's prior conviction for first-degree aggravated robbery under Minnesota Statutes \u00a7 609.245 was a \"crime of violence\" under the sentencing guidelines, resulting in a base offense level of 20.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   USSG \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(4)(A). The court calculated Robinson's advisory guideline range at 51-63 months and sentenced him to 60 months' imprisonment. Robinson argues on appeal that his prior Minnesota conviction does not qualify as a crime of violence, and that he should be resentenced based on a different guideline range calculated from a base offense level of 14.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20922\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(6).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   A state felony conviction qualifies as a \"crime of violence\" under the \"force clause\" of the definition if it \"has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20922\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 4B1.2(a)(1);\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%C2%A7%20922\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 2K2.1, comment.

Because the force clauses under the Act and the sentencing guidelines are identical, the reasoning of\n   <em>\n    Libby\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Pettis\n   </em>\n   establishes that first-degree aggravated robbery in Minnesota qualifies as a crime of violence.
