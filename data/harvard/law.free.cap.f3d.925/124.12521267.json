In 2006, Sambare was admitted to the United States as a lawful permanent resident. In the years following his admission to the United States, Sambare was convicted of various crimes, including credit card theft and forgery. In connection with these convictions, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\") initiated removal proceedings in August 2013, when Sambare returned to the United States from Ghana, where he was visiting his mother. ICE asserted that Sambare was inadmissible pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(A)(i)(I), insofar as it alleged that Sambare previously had been convicted of \"crime[s] involving moral turpitude.\" In October 2013, however, an Immigration Court granted Sambare's application for a waiver of inadmissibility pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201182\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (h) and thus restored his status as a lawful permanent resident.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In September 2015, police in York County, Pennsylvania, stopped Sambare in his vehicle after he allegedly made an illegal U-turn. During the traffic stop, the officer informed Sambare that he detected the scent of marijuana, and Sambare-who at one point provided a false name to the officer-admitted that he had smoked marijuana prior to operating the vehicle. Pursuant to a subsequent drug screening, Sambare tested positive for marijuana in his system. The Commonwealth charged Sambare with, among other crimes, driving under the influence of a Schedule I controlled substance, in violation of the Pennsylvania DUI Statute. In April 2016, Sambare pleaded guilty to violating the Pennsylvania DUI Statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   As a result of Sambare's conviction for violating the Pennsylvania DUI Statute, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security initiated removal proceedings, asserting that Sambare's conviction was for a \"violation of ... any law or regulation of a State ... relating to a controlled substance ..., other than a single offense involving possession for one's own use of 30 grams or less of marijuana\" under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201227\">\n    8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (a)(2)(B)(i).
