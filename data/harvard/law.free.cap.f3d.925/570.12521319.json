After a seven-week trial, the jury awarded the plaintiffs damages which, after trebling, amounted to $ 655.5 million. On appeal, this Court held that the federal courts lacked personal jurisdiction over the defendants with respect to the plaintiffs' claims. This Court vacated the judgment of the district court and remanded the case with instructions to dismiss the action. The mandate issued on November 28, 2016, and the Supreme Court denied the plaintiffs' petition for a writ of certiorari on April 2, 2018. The plaintiffs have now moved to recall the mandate based on the recently enacted Anti-Terrorism Clarification Act (\"ATCA\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The ATCA became law on October 3, 2018.

The provision states that \"regardless of the date of the occurrence of the act of international terrorism upon which [a] civil action [brought under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202333\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2333\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ] was filed,\" a defendant shall be deemed to have consented to personal jurisdiction in such action if the defendant either (a) accepts any of three specified forms of assistance after the date that is 120 days after Section 4 of the ATCA was enacted or (b) is \"benefiting from a waiver or suspension of section 1003 of the [ATA]\" and, after the date that is 120 days after Section 4 of the ATCA was enacted, establishes or continues to maintain \"any office, headquarters, premises, or other facilities or establishments within the jurisdiction of the United States.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202334\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On October 8, 2018, the plaintiffs filed the present motion to recall the mandate issued in this case. They argue that Section 4 of the ATCA provides the federal courts with jurisdiction over the defendants with respect to the plaintiffs' claims. The defendants counter that the plaintiffs have failed to show circumstances that warrant the extraordinary remedy of recalling the mandate and that, in any event, Section 4 of the ATCA does not apply retroactively to closed cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The federal courts of appeals \"possess an inherent power to recall [a] mandate, subject to review for abuse of discretion.\"\n   <em>\n    Taylor v.

As to the first factual predicate, acceptance of a qualifying form of United States assistance, the plaintiffs state only that the defendants have accepted qualifying assistance in the past; they do not contend that the defendants currently do so. Meanwhile, in\n   <em>\n    Klieman v. Palestinian Authority\n   </em>\n   , which was decided on May 14, 2019, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit accepted the representation the Department of Justice made in an amicus curiae brief that neither the PLO nor the PA accept United States assistance.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12521007\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/923/1115/#p1128\">\n    923 F.3d 1115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1128-29 (D.C. Cir. 2019). The papers the plaintiffs filed in connection with this motion do not provide any reason to doubt the Department of Justice's representation or the\n   <em>\n    Klieman\n   </em>\n   court's adoption of that representation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The plaintiffs also fail to show that, in accordance with Section 4's second factual predicate, the defendants benefit from a waiver or suspension of Section 1003 of the ATA and have established or continued to maintain an office or other facility \"within the jurisdiction of the United States.\" Both conditions are necessary under Section 4's second factual predicate.\n   <em>\n    Klieman\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12521007\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/923/1115/#p1128\">\n    923 F.3d at 1129\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   As to the first condition, the plaintiffs have not established that the defendants benefit from an express waiver or suspension under Section 1003 of the ATA. The plaintiffs contend that an express waiver is not required by Section 4 of the ATCA, and that the President impliedly suspended Section 1003 of the ATA with respect to the defendants by permitting the defendants to engage in conduct allowed only if Section 1003 were suspended. But the\n   <em>\n    Klieman\n   </em>\n   court persuasively rejected a similar argument, reasoning that allowing implied waivers to qualify under Section 4 of the ATCA would \"neglect the actual language of the legal authorization to issue waivers under [ATA] \u00a7 1003, ... which creates legal consequences when the President\n   'certifies in writing' that a waiver is to be issued.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12521007\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/923/1115/#p1128\">\n    923 F.3d at 1131\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The plaintiffs in this case have not put forth anything that could qualify as, or substitute for, an express waiver or suspension under Section 1003 of the ATA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Moreover, the plaintiffs in this case have not shown that the defendants have established or continued to maintain an office or other facility within the jurisdiction of the United States. Although the PLO maintains its United Nations Observer Mission in New York, the prohibitions of Section 1003 of the ATA do not apply to that office.\n   <em>\n    Klinghoffer v. S.N.C.

The Observer Mission is not considered to be within the jurisdiction of the United States.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Klinghoffer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10521606\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/937/44/#p46\">\n    937 F.2d at 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[T]he PLO's participation in the UN is dependent on the legal fiction that the UN Headquarters is not really United States territory at all, but is rather neutral ground over which the United States has ceded control.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The plaintiffs point out that, according to\n   <em>\n    Klinghoffer\n   </em>\n   , \"activities not conducted in furtherance of the PLO's observer status may properly be considered as a basis of jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10521606\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/937/44/#p46\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10521606\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/937/44/#p46\">\n    at 51\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But this statement was made in reference to determining whether such activities conferred personal jurisdiction over the PLO under \u00a7 301 of the New York Civil Practice Laws and Rules. Nothing in\n   <em>\n    Klinghoffer\n   </em>\n   suggests that the PLO's engaging in activities unrelated to its observer status transforms the PLO's Observer Mission into an office or other facility for the PLO \"within the jurisdiction of the United States.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   In sum, the plaintiffs have provided no basis to conclude that a factual predicate of Section 4 of the ATCA has been met in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   <strong>\n    B.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   This Court's interest in finality also weighs against recalling the mandate. When its factual predicates are met, Section 4 provides jurisdiction over a defendant \"regardless of the date of the occurrence of the act of international terrorism upon which [the relevant] civil action was filed,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=18%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%202334\">\n    18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (e)(1), providing that the defendant subsequently commits certain acts. But irrespective of whether this language suggests that Section 4 applies retroactively to pending cases, such as the appeal in\n   <em>\n    Klieman\n   </em>\n   , it does not suggest that courts should reopen cases that are no longer pending. Legislation applies prospectively unless Congress explicitly provides for retroactive application.\n   <em>\n    Vartelas v.

The mandate in this case was issued two and a half years ago, and the Supreme Court denied the plaintiffs' petition for a writ of certiorari more than six months before the plaintiffs filed their motion to recall the mandate.
