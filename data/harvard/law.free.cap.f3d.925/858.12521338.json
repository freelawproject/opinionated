Kentucky argues that these measures, enacted to prevent corruption and protect its citizens' trust in their elected officials, comport with the Constitution. The district court, for the most part, disagreed with the Commonwealth. We see it differently.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    I. BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   John Schickel, the incumbent state senator for the 11th Senatorial District in Kentucky, and David Watson, who unsuccessfully ran for the 6th House District in 2016, brought this suit alleging that several of Kentucky's campaign finance and ethics statutes violated their rights protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. They sued several members of Kentucky's Registry of Election Finance (KREF) and Legislative Ethics Commission (KLEC), agencies charged with enforcing the campaign finance and ethics laws.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   This appeal challenges the now defunct campaign finance provision that restricted the amount a candidate may loan to his campaign.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=Ky.%20Rev.%20Stat.%20Ann.%20%C2%A7%20121.150\">\n    Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. \u00a7 121.150\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (13). As for the ethics provisions, the legislators challenge seven of them. Of the seven, three groups of two mirroring\n   provisions-one proscribing certain conduct by legislators and the corollary version for lobbyists-impose:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   (1)\n   <strong>\n    a contribution ban\n   </strong>\n   , \u00a7\u00a7 6.767(2) and 6.811(6), which prohibits a legislator, candidate for the legislature, or his or her campaign committee from accepting a campaign contribution from a lobbyist, and a lobbyist from making the same;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   (2)\n   <strong>\n    a regular session contribution ban\n   </strong>\n   , \u00a7\u00a7 6.767(3) and 6.811(7), which prohibits a legislator, candidate for the legislature, or his or her campaign committee from accepting a campaign contribution from an employer of a lobbyist or a political committee (PAC) during a regular session of the General Assembly, and an employer of a lobbyist from making the same; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   (3)\n   <strong>\n    a gift ban\n   </strong>\n   , \u00a7\u00a7 6.751(2) and 6.811(4), which prohibits a legislator or his spouse from accepting \"anything of value\" from a lobbyist or his employer, and a lobbyist or employer of a lobbyist from knowingly offering the same to a legislator, candidate, or his family.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The final ethics provision applies only to lobbyists:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   (4)\n   <strong>\n    a solicitation/treasurer ban\n   </strong>\n   , \u00a7 6.811(5), which prohibits a lobbyist from (i) serving as a campaign treasurer, and (ii) directly soliciting, controlling, or delivering a campaign contribution to a legislator or candidate.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The district court dismissed the campaign finance claim as moot because a legislative amendment eliminated the provision. As for the ethics provisions, the court found that the laws burdened \"core political speech\" and curtailed freedom of association, requiring strict scrutiny of every ethics provision except the regular session contribution ban. It ultimately upheld the regular session contribution ban, but found all the other challenged ethics provisions unconstitutional and unenforceable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Defendants then moved this court for a stay pending appeal, which we granted. The parties cross-appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   <strong>\n    II. CAMPAIGN FINANCE PROVISION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   We begin with the self-funding restriction, repealed in 2017 by the Kentucky legislature, which limited the amount a candidate could personally loan his own campaign.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 121.150(13) (repealed 2017). Though this court found the provision wholly unconstitutional in\n   <em>\n    Anderson v.

In a pre-enforcement challenge, such as here, a plaintiff satisfies the injury-in-fact requirement by alleging \"an intention to engage in a course of conduct arguably affected with a constitutional interest, but proscribed by a statute, and there exists a credible threat of prosecution thereunder.\"\n   <em>\n    Susan B.

KREF has not enforced this provision since\n   <em>\n    Anderson\n   </em>\n   struck it down. Indeed, \"if a statute is unconstitutional on its face, the State may not enforce the statute under\n   any circumstances.\"\n   <em>\n    Women's Med. Prof'l Corp. v. Voinovich\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11888853\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/130/187/#p193\">\n    130 F.3d 187\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 193 (6th Cir. 1997). The legislators cite several alleged enforcements, but all involve other provisions- \u00a7\u00a7 121.180 and 121.150(1), (6), (12), and (20) -not this one.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Russell v. Lundergan-Grimes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4182096\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/784/1037/#p1049\">\n    784 F.3d 1037\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1049 (6th Cir. 2015) (history of past enforcement against others established injury in fact). Nor have the legislators shown that KREF has any intention to enforce this provision. At its 30(b)(6) deposition, in its motion for summary judgment, and during oral argument before this panel, KREF explicitly disavowed enforcement against the legislators for any violations of this provision. The legislators' case does not resemble those it cites to support its position.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Thus, because there exists no credible threat of prosecution, the legislators lack standing to challenge this provision. We affirm the district court's dismissal of the claim on standing grounds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    III. LOBBYING RESTRICTIONS\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Before addressing the merits, we consider whether the legislators have standing to assert challenges to the four ethics provisions governing only the conduct of lobbyists. If the legislators cannot establish constitutional standing, \"their claims must be dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\"\n   <em>\n    Loren v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Mich.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5859373\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/505/598/#p607\">\n    505 F.3d 598\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 607 (6th Cir. 2007).
