They each spent close to two and a half of those years on death row.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   These men cannot get back any of the time they lost or erase the things they experienced. The best they can hope for is a remedy of damages under\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201983\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983\n   </extracted-citation>\n   and Ohio law. This appeal concerns whether their complaints state sufficient facts for certain claims not to be dismissed and whether the men have presented enough evidence for other claims to overcome summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In 1975, Jackson, Ajamu, and Bridgeman were convicted of murder. Their convictions were based largely on the purportedly eyewitness testimony of Edward Vernon, who then was thirteen years old. In 2014, nearly forty years later, Vernon recanted, disclosing that police officers had coerced him into testifying falsely. Vernon's recantation led to the overturning of appellants' convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The exonerated men filed suit in the Northern District of Ohio, alleging \u00a7 1983 claims based on alleged violations of their constitutional rights by the officers and the City of Cleveland (\"Cleveland\"), along with state-law claims for indemnification against Cleveland. This appeal requires us to untangle a knot of legal issues surrounding the district court's grant of appellees' motions for judgment on the pleadings and for summary judgment and its denial of appellants' motions to amend their complaints. We\n   <strong>\n    AFFIRM\n   </strong>\n   the district court's grant of summary judgment as to the \u00a7 1983 claims based on conspiracy, but we\n   <strong>\n    REVERSE\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    REMAND\n   </strong>\n   the district court's (1) judgment on the pleadings as to the indemnification claims; (2) denial of appellants' motions to amend their complaints to substitute the administrator of the estates of the deceased officers as a party in their place; (3) summary judgment\n   as to \u00a7 1983 claims arising from violations of\n   <em>\n    Brady v.

Although it was generally understood that anything in a detective's file that was pertinent to a case \"should go to the prosecutor,\" it was up to individual officers whether they followed this policy, and they did not always do so. R. 103, PageID 3794. The general practice at the time, followed in \"every case,\" was for detectives to provide prosecutors with only \"arrest reports, witness forms and written statements taken by the Statement Unit,\" and \"photos,\" while omitting to turn over other evidence, including potentially exculpatory evidence, unless it was specifically requested by the prosecutor.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"931781\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/434/461/#p464\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at PageID 3672-75.

This was done, one officer testified, \"because winning the case was what it was all about. It wasn't about what was fair, it wasn't about what was honest, it was about winning.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"931781\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/434/461/#p464\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at PageID 3967-68.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Against this backdrop of evidence of incomplete\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   knowledge and frequent\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violations, the record tells the following story.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On May 19, 1975, Edward Vernon, then twelve years old, was riding the bus home from school when he heard two gunshots. Being twelve, Vernon exited the bus at the\n   earliest opportunity and ran to where he believed the shots originated. Coming upon the scene, Vernon found a gunshot victim, but nothing to indicate who was responsible for the shooting. After police had secured the area, Vernon left and met up with a friend who told Vernon that the perpetrators were Ricky Jackson, Kwame Ajamu (then known as Ronnie Bridgeman), and Wiley Bridgeman (collectively, \"Plaintiffs\"). Vernon, a civic-minded youth, returned to the crime scene and told an officer that he knew who had committed the shooting, whereupon the officer recorded Vernon's contact information.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The next day, Detectives Eugene Terpay and James Farmer went to Vernon's house and requested that he go down to the station to give a statement. As Vernon later recounted, when his mother asked to accompany him to the station, the officers \"told her, no, he'll be all right, he'll be all right.\" R. 99-1, PageID 1183. At the station, Vernon told Terpay and Farmer that Plaintiffs had committed the shooting and gave their descriptions, which he was able to do because he knew them from the neighborhood. The following day, Terpay and Farmer again went to Vernon's house and asked him for Plaintiffs' addresses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Detective John Staimpel, along with his partner Frank Stoiker, was working the case with Terpay and Farmer. On May 25, Staimpel and another detective, whose name Vernon cannot remember, picked Vernon up at his house to bring him to a line-up. Vernon's mother again asked to accompany him, and Vernon recalls the detectives saying, \"[N]o, he'll be all right. We'll bring him back after the lineup.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"931781\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/434/461/#p464\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at PageID 1189. The detectives brought Vernon to the line-up and, as he recollects, asked him if \"I see anybody that I recognize up there,\" which Vernon interpreted as asking whether he had seen anyone in the line-up commit the shooting.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"931781\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/434/461/#p464\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at PageID 1190. Vernon replied that he had not. Ricky Jackson and Wiley Bridgeman, who had been arrested earlier in the day, were in that line-up. From Vernon's point of view, he had been forthright up until this point: he had honestly told the detectives that (he thought) he knew who had committed the crime, but he had never said that he had actually witnessed the crime, and so when he was asked at the line-up whether he saw anyone whom he had seen commit the crime, he said no.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The two detectives then brought Vernon into a room, whereupon Staimpel accused Vernon of lying, threatened to send his parents to jail for perjury, banged on a table, and used racial pejoratives to describe Vernon. (Vernon and Plaintiffs are African-Americans.) After Vernon began to cry, Staimpel said, \"[W]e'll fix it,\" and the detectives left the room.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"931781\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/434/461/#p464\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at PageID 1191. When the detectives returned, they gave Vernon a piece of paper, explained to him that it said he had failed to identify Jackson and Bridgeman in the line-up because he had been scared of their retaliating, and told Vernon to sign it, which Vernon did.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Stoiker signed a police report dated May 25, 1975, which described Stoiker and Staimpel's picking Vernon up and taking him to the line-up, Vernon's failing to identify Jackson and Bridgeman, and Vernon's explaining this failure as due to his being \"very afraid\" of Plaintiffs. R. 114-19, PageID 5113.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The day after the line-up, Terpay and Farmer again spoke with Vernon. The detectives brought Vernon to the station, where he told them that he had not witnessed the crime and that he had never said that he had witnessed the crime. Terpay was wroth, yelling at Vernon and accusing him of having lied when he had gone to the line-up and said \"that this is not them.\" R. 99-1, PageID 1194. Terpay\n   threatened to send Vernon's parents to jail for perjury, and Vernon agreed to testify that he had seen Plaintiffs commit the crime.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   A police report dated May 28, 1975 indicates that Stoiker and Staimpel \"[c]onsulted with [the prosecutor] who issued papers charging [Plaintiffs] with [homicide].\" R. 114-28, PageID 5321.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Prior to Jackson's trial, Terpay coached Vernon regarding his testimony and afterwards reviewed the trial transcript with Vernon to ensure that his testimony in the trials of Bridgeman and Ajamu was consistent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Plaintiffs were convicted at separate trials. They were sentenced to death, but their sentences were later reduced to life imprisonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   For nearly forty years, Vernon struggled with the knowledge that his testimony had put Plaintiffs in prison. He later testified, \"Through out [sic] the years this case has ... be[en] heavy on my emotion, my everything.\" R. 99-2, PageID 1234. \"I wanted to come forward throughout the years, but I was scared, scared to come forward and tell the truth ... with this battle in my mind, battle in my spirit, battle in my heart .... I'm battling with this ... pretty much all my life ....\" R. 99-1, PageID 1203. The years did not lessen the turmoil in Vernon's mind.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   One day in 2013, Vernon finally disburdened his conscience. He was lying in a hospital bed, stricken with hypertension and kidney failure, when his pastor visited and told him that Innocence Project attorneys were seeking to exonerate Plaintiffs. Vernon testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   So, after he stated that and I said, okay, well, you know what-I got up out of the bed and I just broke down and I cried on his shoulder and I said, well, I'm ready to tell the truth, I'm ready to come forward and tell the truth that Ricky Jackson did not commit the crime that he went to prison for.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204596\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/475/469/#p480\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at PageID 1203-04.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Vernon formally recanted his testimony against each of the three Plaintiffs in November 2014. After the recantation, the prosecutor for Cuyahoga County, where Cleveland is located, admitted that there was \"no evidence tying any of the three convicted defendants to the crimes\" and that \"[t]hey have been victims of a terrible injustice.\" R. 116, PageID 6302-03.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   B. Procedural History\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   On May 19, 2015, Jackson filed suit against Terpay, Farmer, Stoiker,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Staimpel, and Cleveland (collectively, \"Defendants\"), as well as others,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   alleging a multitude of state and federal claims. Bridgeman and Ajamu filed suit against the same defendants on July 2, 2015. On October 1, 2015, Cleveland moved for judgment on the pleadings, under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c), as to the state-law claims in both complaints. The district court granted both motions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   In November 2015, Jackson, and Bridgeman and Ajamu in their parallel lawsuit, all moved for leave to file amended complaints substituting the administrator of the estates of the deceased Defendants (the \"administrator\") for those Defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   (J. Reid Yoder is the administrator of all of the estates.) The district court denied those motions as futile, reasoning that a \u00a7 1983 claim brought in Ohio does not survive a defendant's death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   On January 27, 2017, Stoiker (the only living individual Defendant) moved for summary judgment in both lawsuits, arguing that he was not involved in any unconstitutional activity and that, even if he was, he is protected by qualified immunity. On the same date, Cleveland also moved for summary judgment as to the\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   claims, arguing that Plaintiffs had failed to provide evidence sufficient for a jury to find Cleveland liable. The district court granted both motions for summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   II. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   We review de novo a judgment on the pleadings under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c), applying the same standard we apply to review the grant of a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6).\n   <em>\n    Warrior Sports, Inc. v.

The\n   <em>\n    Tinney\n   </em>\n   plaintiff had sued in Ohio; therefore, his \u00a7 1983 claims were subject to Ohio survival rules just as Plaintiffs' claims are here. Noting that the\n   <em>\n    Tinney\n   </em>\n   court did not apply Ohio's survival rule for personal injury actions to a \u00a7 1983 malicious prosecution claim, the\n   <em>\n    Crabbs\n   </em>\n   court announced that it was \"part[ing] way with\"\n   <em>\n    Tinney\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Crabbs\n   </em>\n   , 880 F.3d at 296.

The court's language could not be clearer: \"the appropriate level at which to generalize a \u00a7 1983 claim under state law is as\n   <em>\n    a personal injury action, sounding in tort, and nothing further\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6201048\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/261/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6201048\" index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/471/261/\">\n    at 296\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

After\n   <em>\n    Crabbs\n   </em>\n   , all claims brought under \u00a7 1983 are to be treated as actions sounding in personal injury tort. Because Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 2305.21 provides that actions for personal injury survive the death of the tortfeasor, and that statute does not conflict with the laws of the United States,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Crabbs\n   </em>\n   , 880 F.3d at 295, all \u00a7 1983 actions brought in Ohio survive the death of the tortfeasor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Therefore, through no fault of its own because its ruling predated\n   <em>\n    Crabbs\n   </em>\n   , the district court was in error as to its grounds for finding that the proposed amendments, substituting the administrator of the estates of Terpay, Staimpel, and Farmer for those Defendants, would be futile.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   2. Timeliness of Plaintiffs' Claims Against the Estates\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   Defendants argue that we should affirm the district court on alternative grounds-namely, that the claims against the estates were not timely brought. Proper adjudication of this issue requires analysis of both Ohio and federal law. Defendants argue that Ohio estate law regarding the timely filing of claims defines which entities have the capacity to be sued, while Plaintiffs argue that those provisions are merely statutes of limitations.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Ohio Rev. Code \u00a7\u00a7 2117.06, 2117.37.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The points of contention do not end there, however. If Plaintiffs are correct that Ohio estate law merely establishes statutes of limitations, the parties also dispute whether those statutes or the general Ohio statute of limitations applies to \u00a7 1983 suits. On the other hand, if Defendants are correct that Ohio estate law defines which entities have the capacity to be sued, the parties also disagree over whether federal courts hearing \u00a7 1983 actions are bound by that definition, as well as whether an exception to that definition, provided in Ohio Revised Code \u00a7 2117.06(G), applies to the facts of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The district court did not address these issues, instead relying on its holding that the \u00a7 1983 claims did not survive the deaths of the deceased Defendants.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"It is the general rule that a federal appellate court does not consider an issue not passed upon below.\"\n   <em>\n    Lindsay v.

It did so for two reasons. First, it held that there was insufficient evidence for a jury to find that Stoiker was involved with the unconstitutional activity at all, noting that Vernon had never identified Stoiker as one of the officers involved.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Second, even if Stoiker were involved, the district court held, there was insufficient evidence that he was aware of any exculpatory evidence, and an officer unaware of exculpatory evidence cannot suppress that evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   We disagree with the district court's reasoning. Given the evidence in the record, although a jury might ultimately find that Stoiker did not suppress evidence, it would not be unreasonable in finding that he had.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Consider the following evidence. Vernon testified that Staimpel and another officer led him into a room after he failed to identify Plaintiffs at a line-up and coerced him into signing a false statement about that line-up. Staimpel testified at trial that (1) Stoiker was his partner and (2) Stoiker was present for the line-up. Based on Staimpel's testimony, a reasonable jury could infer that (3) Stoiker was present during the post-line-up interview of Vernon and (4) Stoiker was present when Vernon signed his false statement explaining his \"fear\" of Plaintiffs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   In addition, the record contains a police report, signed by Stoiker and dated the day that Vernon testified he was coerced into signing a false statement by two detectives, detailing the version of the line-up and subsequent interview that Vernon alleges were fabricated. The district court is correct that the report does not say that Stoiker was involved in that line-up and interview, but a jury is \"allowed to make reasonable inferences from facts proven in evidence having a reasonable tendency to sustain them,\"\n   <em>\n    Galloway v.

And if Stoiker was present\n   when Vernon was coerced into signing the allegedly false statement, he knew that Vernon had\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   given fear of Plaintiffs as his true reason for not identifying them-in other words, that the statement was false.

While his possible awareness of this evidence is less clear-cut than of the above-mentioned pieces of exculpatory evidence, it would not be unreasonable for a jury to infer that Stoiker knew Vernon had said he had not seen Plaintiffs commit the crime with which they were charged. Whether or not Stoiker was told by other officers that Vernon had not seen Plaintiffs commit the murder, Vernon stated that he was asked at the line-up \"if I could recognize anyone there who was at the shooting\" and that he answered that question in the negative.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   R. 99-3, PageID 1236.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   Stoiker and the district court interpret that question as asking whether Vernon recognized anyone in the line-up.

A reasonable jury could find that Vernon, the only witness to the events who has testified to the contents of that conversation, interpreted the question correctly.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   As Stoiker did not disclose any of this evidence to prosecutors, a reasonable jury could find that Stoiker suppressed exculpatory evidence in violation of\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   As to the third element of a\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   claim, a reasonable jury could find that Plaintiffs suffered prejudice as a result of the alleged suppression.

Because Vernon's coerced statement formed the core of the prosecution's case, there is a reasonable likelihood that, had the juries in Plaintiffs' trials known that that statement was fabricated and coerced, or that Vernon had orally stated that he had not seen the shooting, the juries would not have convicted Plaintiffs.

First, he contends there was insufficient evidence that he was involved in the fabrication of Vernon's statement. Second, Stoiker argues there was insufficient evidence that the fabricated statement affected the decision of the jury. The district court agreed with both of Stoiker's arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Turning to the first argument, a reasonable jury could find, as discussed in section II(C)(1)(a),\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , that Stoiker was in the room when Vernon was initially intimidated, left the room with Staimpel, and then returned to the room with Staimpel, at which point Staimpel coerced Vernon into signing the statement. This does not necessarily entail that Stoiker participated in the creation of the false statement, but a reasonable jury could infer that Stoiker either drafted, or assisted Staimpel in drafting, the false statement. If Stoiker was actively involved in the fabrication of the false statement, he knowingly fabricated evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-112\">\n   As for the second argument, there is, in fact, sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to conclude that the false statement influenced the juries at Plaintiffs' trials. True, as the district court noted, although the statement was introduced in evidence by the defense at Jackson's trial, it was used only by defense counsel in an attempt to impeach Vernon's testimony and \"it is unclear whether the jury in the Jackson trial had the statement while they were deliberating.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Jackson v.

Ohio Aug. 4, 2017). Also, the statement was not admitted in evidence at Bridgeman's or Ajamu's trial at all. And it is fair to conclude, as the district court reasoned, that \"Vernon's live testimony,\" not the statement, \"led to the conviction[s] in all three trials.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"134\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%203380456\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   But the relevant question is not whether the fabricated evidence was\n   <em>\n    shown\n   </em>\n   to the jury; it is whether the statement\n   <em>\n    affected\n   </em>\n   the decision of the jury. For example, a fabricated search warrant affidavit, used to obtain evidence later shown to the jury, can form the basis for a fabrication-of-evidence suit.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Webb v.

And fabricated evidence that \"is used as [the] basis for a criminal charge\" can form the basis for a \u00a7 1983 claim because, absent that evidence, there would have been no jury.\n   <em>\n    Halsey v. Pfeiffer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4066643\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/750/273/\">\n    750 F.3d 273\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 294 n.19 (3d Cir. 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   A reasonable jury in the present case could find that the fabricated statement impacted the juries' decisions in the criminal trials in at least two ways. First, the prosecutor testified that his understanding of Vernon's statement was based on the copy in the police report and that, if he had known what had actually happened on the day of the line-up, he would have declined to prosecute: he does not, as he put it, \"believe in prosecuting innocent people.\" R. 114-29, PageID 5350. The prosecutor did not speak to Vernon prior to bringing charges, and so the false statement constituted the entire basis for his understanding of Vernon's involvement. If Staimpel and Stoiker had not fabricated Vernon's statement, therefore, charges would not have been brought, and, of\n   course, a jury that is never empaneled is a jury that does not return a guilty verdict.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   A jury in the present case also could find that the falsified statement caused the criminal verdicts because the statement coerced Vernon to testify in conformance with it. Unlike Staimpel's baseless threat to prosecute Vernon's parents if Vernon failed to sign a statement saying that he had seen Plaintiffs commit the crime, Vernon would have faced a real threat of prosecution for perjury had his testimony conflicted with his earlier signed statement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Osburn v.

I, 214-15 (1835) (admitting as evidence of perjury a paper signed by the defendant).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   A reasonable jury could therefore find both that Stoiker participated in the fabrication of Vernon's statement and that there is a reasonable probability the statement affected the juries at Plaintiffs' trials.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   c. Conspiracy to Withhold and Fabricate Evidence\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   To make out a claim for conspiracy to deprive them of their due process rights, Plaintiffs must show \"that (1) a single plan existed, (2) the conspirators shared a conspiratorial objective to deprive the plaintiffs of their constitutional rights, and (3) an overt act was committed in furtherance of the conspiracy that caused the injury.\"\n   <em>\n    Robertson v.

Whether a defendant is protected by qualified immunity turns not on whether the defendant was on notice that his actions satisfied the elements of a particular cause of action, but instead on whether the defendant was on notice that his actions violated the laws of the United States.

If they were not inconsistent, then a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether Cleveland had such a policy, and summary judgment was improper on Plaintiffs' first\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   a. The Text of GPO 19-73\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   Cleveland notes that the only language in GPO 19-73 discussing officers' disclosure obligations simply made it clear that they were not permitted to give any physical evidence directly to a defendant; it did not say officers were permitted to withhold exculpatory evidence from prosecutors. Under this reading of GPO 19-73, the purpose of the order was to ensure that officers did not give evidence directly to defendants and, perhaps as something of an addendum, let officers know what prosecutors might have to do with the evidence officers gave them. The section permitting disclosure of exculpatory witness statements, after all, argues Cleveland, was prefaced by the statement that \"by application to the Prosecuting Attorney and/or the court, the defense counsel may be entitled\" to various evidence, and that language appears to concern the interaction between prosecutors and defendants, not officers and prosecutors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   Cleveland's interpretation of GPO 19-73 may be plausible, but it is not the only reasonable interpretation. The incorporated letter from the County Prosecutor informed Cleveland police officers that \"Rule 16 is going to be the concern of\n   <em>\n    police departments\n   </em>\n   and prosecutors,\" not just prosecutors. (emphasis added). The incorporated letter recreated in part the text of Rule 16, which dealt only with what sorts of evidence required disclosure, not with who would do the disclosing. That GPO 19-73 told officers that Rule 16 was their concern and provided the text of that Rule, which described which evidence must be disclosed, could suggest that GPO 19-73 was promulgated for the purpose of ensuring officers knew what particular evidence they had to disclose to prosecutors so that the prosecutors could then disclose that evidence to the defense. Under this reading, GPO 19-73 did more than simply inform\n   officers that they should not give evidence directly to defendants; it also served as the directive to officers as to what evidence they should, and should not, give to prosecutors. Particular to the last point, the \"EXCEPTION TO THE FOREGOING\" provision could be read to direct officers not to turn over to prosecutors the documents described in that provision, which included \"statements made by witnesses or prospective witnesses to state agents.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   Therefore, one reasonable reading of GPO 19-73 is that it (1) spoke to police officers about their disclosure obligations and (2) informed them that they did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   need to disclose exculpatory witness statements to the Prosecutor's Office. Because GPO 19-73 can be read as consistent with a policy of not disclosing exculpatory witness statements, we turn to the other written rules to see whether any of those foreclosed such a policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   b. Other Rules\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   Cleveland's second argument for why a reasonable jury could not read GPO 19-73 as embodying a policy of allowing officers to withhold exculpatory witness statements from prosecutors is stronger, but ultimately unavailing. Instead of looking at GPO 19-73 in a vacuum, Cleveland urges us to consider the text of GPO 19-73 in the context of other rules and regulations. These other sources fall into two groups: sections of the Division of Police's Manual of Rules and the full text of Rule 16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   i. The Manual\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   The Manual contained a number of rules that were applicable to all Cleveland police officers in 1975. Cleveland points to four rules as requiring, when read in conjunction with GPO 19-73, that officers disclose exculpatory witness statements to prosecutors. While all laudable, each of these policies can, however, reasonably be interpreted as consistent with a reading of GPO 19-73 that permitted officers to withhold exculpatory witness statements from prosecutors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   Rule 14\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-221\">\n   Case Preparation and Fraud Unit\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-222\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-223\">\n   (2) The officer in charge shall cause statements to be taken from persons brought to the Unit in the course of criminal investigations; and shall see that such statements are properly filed and preserved. These statements shall be available only to the officers and members of the Division of Police who are interested in the presentation of a particular case, to the office of the County Prosecutor or the Law Department of the City of Cleveland. Under no circumstances shall they be given or exhibited to any other person without the written consent of the Chief of Police.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   R. 102-2, PageID 1910-11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   Rule 14 only applied to statements given by persons brought to the Case Preparation and Fraud Unit, and there was no requirement that all witnesses be brought to that unit when giving a statement.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nor did it require officers to affirmatively disclose exculpatory statements to prosecutors; it required only that detectives make statements available. This reading is consistent with testimony that it was the practice of Cleveland detectives to withhold evidence not contained in arrest reports, witness forms, or written statements unless\n   it was specifically requested by prosecutors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   Rule 66 [No Title]\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-227\">\n   (1) Officers and members prosecuting persons charged with a crime shall thoroughly familiarize themselves with all of the facts and details concerning such case, so that all of the evidence may be properly presented to the court.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204596\" index=\"295\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/475/469/#p480\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at PageID 1941.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-229\">\n   Rule 66 said nothing about disclosure of evidence to prosecutors, much less exculpatory evidence. More importantly, it only required familiarity with the facts and details of a case insofar as such familiarity was required to \"properly present\" those facts to a court. As discussed above, GPO 19-73 can reasonably be interpreted as not requiring officers to disclose exculpatory witness statements to prosecutors for disclosure in turn to defendants (or, presumably, to courts). Read in conjunction with GPO 19-73, then, Rule 66 can reasonably be interpreted as not applying to exculpatory witness statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   Rule 77 [No Title]\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-231\">\n   (1) Officers and members shall report on all matters referred to or investigated by them.

It did not require that such reports contain all exculpatory information that they may have learned. Importantly, it did not require that any reports be disclosed to prosecutors, and it allowed reports to be made verbally to a superior officer, a method well suited to the withholding of information from prosecutors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-236\">\n   Rule 78 [No Title]\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-237\">\n   Written and verbal reports, testimony in court and conversation of any kind affecting the Division of Police, its officers, members, employees or persons under its jurisdiction shall be truthful and unbiased.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-238\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204596\" index=\"297\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/475/469/#p480\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at PageID 1946.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-239\">\n   Even read in conjunction with GPO 19-73 and the other rules discussed herein, the limitations of Rule 78 render it incapable of carrying the weight with which Cleveland burdens it. It required not that all reports be complete but only that they be truthful and unbiased.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nor did it require that any reports, which may have been made verbally to a superior officer, be disclosed to prosecutors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-240\">\n   None of the rules contained within the Manual, taken individually or collectively,\n   are inconsistent with an interpretation of GPO 19-73 that permits officers to withhold exculpatory information from prosecutors. These rules can be read by a reasonable jury as consistent with a policy of permitting the withholding of exculpatory evidence in violation of\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   ii. Ohio Rule of Criminal Procedure 16\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-242\">\n   Cleveland also argues that the full text of Rule 16 made clear that defendants were entitled to all exculpatory evidence, including witness statements. The version of Rule 16 in force in 1975 read in pertinent part as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-243\">\n   (B) Disclosure of evidence by the prosecuting attorney.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-244\">\n   <em>\n    (1) Information subject to disclosure.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-245\">\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-246\">\n   (f) Disclosure of evidence favorable to defendant. [description of exculpatory evidence]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-247\">\n   (g) In camera inspection of witness' [sic] statement. [description of procedure for in camera inspection of witness statements]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-248\">\n   <em>\n    (2) Information not subject to disclosure.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-249\">\n   <em>\n    Except as provided in subsections (B)(1)\n   </em>\n   (a), (b), (d),\n   <em>\n    (f), and (g)\n   </em>\n   , this rule does not authorize the discovery or inspection of reports, memoranda, or other internal documents made by the prosecuting attorney or his agents in connection with the investigation or prosecution of the case, or of statements made by witnesses or prospective witnesses to state agents.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-250\">\n   <em>\n    Proposed Ohio Rules of Criminal Procedure\n   </em>\n   , 46 Ohio BAR 817, 849-52 (1973) (emphases added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-251\">\n   Unlike GPO 19-73 and the rules in the Manual, Rule 16 made it quite clear that defendants were entitled to exculpatory witness reports. Rule 16(B)(2) excepted witness statements from the general disclosure requirements, using language almost identical to that used in GPO 19-73. Unlike GPO 19-73, however, Rule 16(B)(2) included an additional clause, excepting exculpatory witness statements from the exception for witness statements generally. Rule 16(B)(2) thereby placed exculpatory witness statements back into the universe of mandatory disclosure. As a result, the full text of Rule 16 made it clear that prosecutors were obligated to disclose all exculpatory witness statements to defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-252\">\n   This fact does not, however, save Cleveland, at least not at this stage of the litigation. Cleveland has provided no evidence that Cleveland required that its officers follow the official version of the Ohio Rules of Criminal Procedure, that those rules were followed by Cleveland officers, or that Cleveland officers were even aware of those rules. There is evidence, of course, that Cleveland officers were bound by Rule 16 : GPO 19-73 can reasonably be interpreted as directing that Cleveland officers follow the requirements of Rule 16. But GPO 19-73 could be read as directing Cleveland officers to follow a modified version of Rule 16-the version included in GPO 19-73.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-253\">\n   And that version differed in at least one material way from the official Rule 16. Both GPO 19-73 and the official Rule 16 included a paragraph excepting witness\n   statements from the general disclosure requirements. But although, as mentioned, that paragraph in the official Rule 16 contained an additional clause in paragraph (B)(2) excepting (by reference to the requirements of (B)(1)(f) and (g))\n   <em>\n    exculpatory\n   </em>\n   witness statements from that exception-and the paragraph in the official Rule thereby required that\n   <em>\n    exculpatory\n   </em>\n   witness statements be\n   <em>\n    disclosed\n   </em>\n   -the version of Rule 16 in GPO 19-73\n   <em>\n    omitted\n   </em>\n   the clause in that paragraph excepting exculpatory witness statements. The paragraph in the version of Rule 16 included in GPO 19-73 merely provided:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-254\">\n   The foregoing [disclosure requirements] do[ ] not authorize the discovery or inspection of reports, memoranda, or other internal documents made by the Prosecuting Attorney or his agents (police departments are his agents) in connection with the investigation or prosecution of the case, or of statements made by witnesses or prospective witnesses to state agents.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-255\">\n   R. 101-7, PageID 1630. It was this modified version of Rule 16-the one that could plausibly be interpreted as allowing the withholding of exculpatory witness statements-by which a reasonable jury could find Cleveland officers were bound.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-256\">\n   c. Conclusion\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-257\">\n   GPO 19-73 and the rules in Cleveland's police manual, read together, could be understood to authorize Cleveland officers to withhold exculpatory witness statements from prosecutors. It is for a jury to consider GPO 19-73 and the rules in the Manual in light of Cleveland's actual practices and determine whether Cleveland had a policy of permitting\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violations. Because Cleveland does not contest that it promulgated GPO 19-73 or that the individual Defendants were acting in conformance with GPO 19-73 when they withheld Vernon's exculpatory statements, a reasonable jury could find Cleveland liable under\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Garner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10509282,10509203\" index=\"298\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/8/358/\">\n    8 F.3d at 364-65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-258\">\n   Because a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether Cleveland had a policy of permitting\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violations, the district court's grant of summary judgment to Cleveland on Plaintiffs' first\n   <em>\n    Monell\n   </em>\n   theory was improper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-259\">\n   2.

Cleveland disagrees, citing deposition testimony to show that officers received official training in their disclosure obligations as well as unofficial on-the-job training in their disclosure obligations. The district court agreed with Cleveland.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-266\">\n   It is undisputed that Cleveland officers received, and were trained in, the Manual. But as discussed in section II(D)(1)(b)(i),\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   , those rules could be read as insufficient to inform officers of their disclosure obligations, as none of the rules in the Manual explicitly mandated disclosure of exculpatory witness statements to prosecutors. The only rule from the Manual that came close to requiring disclosure of witness statements to prosecutors was Rule 14, which applied only to witness statements made to the Case Preparation and Fraud Unit, and it only required that those statements be available to prosecutors, not that they be proactively disclosed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-267\">\n   Cleveland presents deposition testimony that \"in the police academy ... [y]ou were told to give [exculpatory evidence] to ... a prosecutor\" and that \"Cleveland police officers are trained and instructed to turn over the entire product of their investigation to the prosecutor.\" R. 103, PageID 3664, 3672.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-268\">\n   Cleveland also presents evidence that officers were trained on the job to disclose evidence. One officer testified that although the rule was not always followed, \"the rule was, you should turn over all evidence acquired in an investigation to the prosecution.\" R. 104, PageID 3949-50. That officer also testified:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-269\">\n   Police officers that conduct interviews are instructed to write down the statement as close to what the witness said as possible, whether it is good or bad. But it is part of what was said, and it needs to be, the entire thing needs to be presented to the prosecutor, the entire thing, not parts of it, the entire thing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-270\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204596\" index=\"305\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/475/469/#p480\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at PageID 3972.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-271\">\n   But Plaintiffs provide testimony that conflicts with Cleveland's account of the training received, both in the academy and on the job.

He also testified that there was \"[n]o specific training\" requiring police detectives \"to disclose exculpatory evidence.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at PageID 1777.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-274\">\n   The district court interpreted these statements as indicating only that no official training had been provided, not that no on-the-job training had been provided.\n   <em>\n    Jackson v.

Plaintiffs cite no Sixth Circuit or Supreme Court case in support of their theory that they have a\n    <em>\n     Monell\n    </em>\n    claim-separate from their failure-to-train claim-based on Cleveland's unconstitutional failure to adopt a policy.

That makes sense: the harm alleged and the analysis required under the failure-to-train theory are functionally indistinguishable from the harm Plaintiffs allege and the analysis they wish us to conduct under the failure-to-adopt-a-policy theory.
