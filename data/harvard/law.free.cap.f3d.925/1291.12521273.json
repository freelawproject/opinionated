They are thus committed to the custody of the federal government. At some point, an unaccompanied minor might be released to an approved sponsor (usually a relative) pending determination of her entitlement to stay in the United States. If no suitable sponsor exists, an unaccompanied minor might remain in the government's custody for an extended period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Certain unaccompanied alien children are pregnant when they arrive in federal custody, after what is often a hazardous journey. Though many carry their pregnancies to term, some desire to terminate their pregnancies. But in 2017, the government instituted a policy effectively barring any unaccompanied alien child in its custody from obtaining a pre-viability abortion. This case concerns the constitutionality of that new policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The policy functions as an across-the-board ban on access to abortion. It does not matter if an unaccompanied minor meets all the requirements to obtain an abortion under the law of the state where she is held-including, for instance, demonstrating she is mature enough to decide on her own whether to terminate her pregnancy. Nor does it matter if she secures her own funding and transportation for the procedure. It does not even matter if her pregnancy results from rape. Regardless, the government denies her access to an abortion. And the government's newfound ban applies only to pregnant\n   <em>\n    minors\n   </em>\n   : anyone aged 18 (or older) in immigration custody\n   is allowed to terminate her pregnancy. Minors alone, that is, must carry their pregnancies to term against their wishes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The claim of one minor in this case brings the policy's breadth and operation into stark relief. She had been raped in her country of origin. After her arrival here and her placement in government custody, she learned she was pregnant as a result of the rape. She repeatedly asked to obtain a pre-viability abortion, to no avail. She remained in government custody as an unaccompanied minor because there was no suitable sponsor to whom she could be released. Nor was there any viable prospect of her returning to her country of origin: indeed, she eventually received a grant of asylum (and lawful status here) due to her well-founded fear of persecution in her country of origin. Still, the government sought to compel this minor to carry her rape-induced pregnancy to term.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   She is one of the named plaintiffs who brought this challenge to the government's policy on behalf of a class of pregnant unaccompanied minors. The district court granted a preliminary injunction in favor of the plaintiffs, and the government now appeals. We initially agree with the district court that the case is not moot, and we find no abuse of discretion in the court's certification of a plaintiffs' class consisting of pregnant unaccompanied minors in the government's custody. On the merits, we sustain the district court's preliminary injunction in principal part.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Under binding Supreme Court precedent, a person has a constitutional right to terminate her pregnancy before fetal viability, and the government cannot unduly burden her decision. The government accepts the applicability of that settled framework to unaccompanied alien children in its custody. Those controlling principles dictate affirming the district court's preliminary injunction against the government's blanket denial of access to abortion for unaccompanied minors. We are unanimous in rejecting the government's position that its denial of abortion access can be squared with Supreme Court precedent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   We vacate and remand, though, a separate aspect of the district court's preliminary injunction, which bars disclosure to parents and others of unaccompanied minors' pregnancies and abortion decisions. That portion of the preliminary injunction, we conclude, warrants further explication to aid appellate review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Unaccompanied alien children (UACs) are minors in the United States with no lawful immigration status and no parents or legal guardians in the country able to care for them.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=6%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20279\">\n    6 U.S.C. \u00a7 279\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (g).

Previously, there had been no need for a shelter to secure the Director's approval before assisting a minor with accessing abortion services (unless federal funds were to be used directly for the procedure). A shelter thus could assist a minor if an abortion would be consistent with the relevant state's laws. If a shelter objected to permitting a minor abortion access on religious or other grounds, ORR would transfer her to a shelter willing to provide access.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Under the new policy's requirement to secure the ORR Director's approval before permitting abortion access, Scott Lloyd, who became Director in March 2017, denied every abortion request presented to him during his tenure.

An affirmative answer to both questions ordinarily will suffice to trigger relation back.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Doe and Roe have demonstrated that the exception applies in this case. The claims at issue likely will, or at least might, end quickly. The average length of custody for a minor was 41 days in fiscal year 2017, when the initial complaint was filed, and was roughly 90 days by the beginning of fiscal year 2019. Of course, that is just an average, and certain events could end the claims earlier. A minor under ORR custody may turn 18 years old or successfully seek voluntary departure to her country of origin. The government acknowledges that it may find a sponsor at any point and that it may obviate the claim by finding one swiftly.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Oral Arg. Recording 1:16:13-36. Such is the case for Moe, for whom the government located a sponsor three days after she had joined the case. Thus, as the district court noted, \"the length of time that pregnant [minors] will remain in ORR custody is uncertain and unpredictable.\"\n   <em>\n    Garza\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524648\" index=\"143\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/304/145/#p150\">\n    304 F. Supp. 3d at 159\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The government responds that, for any individual claim, the district court will know in advance the viability date and the relevant abortion deadline for the state where ORR keeps the minor, and that the motion may be decided ahead of those dates. Gov't Br. 24-26; Gov't Reply Br. 5-6. The argument errs in ignoring sponsorship and voluntary departure as potential terminating events. And even if viability were the appropriate time frame for the mootness analysis, we would reject the government's argument. Just as the one-year immigration detention in\n   <em>\n    Preap\n   </em>\n   would end too soon, so too would a full term of pregnancy, let alone the remaining weeks for obtaining a pre-viability abortion after a minor becomes aware of her pregnancy. Furthermore, the Court in\n   <em>\n    Gerstein\n   </em>\n   underscored that a defendant's pretrial detention could come to an end (thus mooting the claim) \"upon acquittal or conviction after trial,\" which might not occur for many months.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11642843\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/420/103/\">\n    420 U.S. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   110 n.11,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11642843\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/420/103/\">\n    95 S.Ct. 854\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The government also stresses that Doe's and Roe's claims remained live long enough for the district court to decide their merits through temporary restraining order applications. Gov't Br. 25-26. The district court \"necessarily ha[d] time to take action\" on the certification request because it had enough time to decide the merits. Gov't Reply Br. 5-6. No case law supports this argument. We reject its upshot as unworkable and inequitable: that some class actions would evaporate because the irreparable harm to individual plaintiffs was clear enough to warrant immediate relief but the class definition issue was complex enough to require discovery. Relatedly, we fear that accepting the argument would vitiate the mootness exception. Courts may issue temporary relief in virtually every case; a judge sometimes will sign a restraining order on the day the plaintiff files her complaint. Indeed, there would have been no need to apply the exception in\n   <em>\n    Gerstein\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    McLaughlin\n   </em>\n   , because the lower courts could have granted interim relief releasing detainees from pretrial custody.

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(a) requires putative class representatives to show that: \"(1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable; (2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class; (3) the claims or defenses of the representative parties are typical of the claims or defenses of the class; and (4) the representative parties will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class.\" Fed.

Here, the government contends that the class fails to meet each of those requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   A proposed class must also satisfy one of the three requirements of Rule 23(b). The district court certified the class under Rule 23(b)(2), which applies when a defendant \"has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief or corresponding declaratory relief is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(b)(2). The government raises no argument of any error in certifying an injunctive class under Rule 23(b)(2), instead confining its arguments to Rule 23(a)'s requirements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   We review the district court's certification of the class only for abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    DL\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12276282\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/860/713/#p722\">\n    860 F.3d at 724\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

How, then, would courts distinguish the circumstances in which subjective opposition gives rise to a conflict of interest precluding class certification from those in which it does not?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   If, say, a Second Amendment claim were brought on behalf of a class of persons subject to a firearms regulation, would there be a need to deny class certification because some absent members may strongly support gun-control measures like the challenged one? Or if a (b)(2) challenge to the consideration of race in a college-admissions process were brought on behalf of all members of the allegedly disfavored racial groups (e.g., Caucasian) denied admission-as was precisely the case in\n   <em>\n    Gratz v.

That manner of logic could ultimately stymie certification in virtually any (b)(2) case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Our dissenting colleague's responses to those situations only confirms that (b)(2) classes can include ideologically opposed members. With regard to the challenge to\n   the firearms regulation, our colleague says that the class would be limited to those who \"\n   <em>\n    claim\n   </em>\n   injury.\" Dissenting Op. 1347. But of course a class could not in fact be defined simply as persons who \"claim injury\"; and regardless, even in a class including only those who, say, own firearms and are therefore subject to the regulation, some members may still oppose the action because they generally support gun-control measures. With regard to the college-admissions challenge, our colleague notes that the class in\n   <em>\n    Gratz\n   </em>\n   was limited to applicants who \"suffered an injury\" when denied admission.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1347. Again, though, some of those rejected applicants may have opposed the suit based on their support of affirmative action, yet they were still part of the class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   Nothing in Rule 23 affords a basis for distinguishing between class members ideologically opposed to the action in\n   <em>\n    Gratz\n   </em>\n   and class members ideologically opposed to the action in this case. Our colleague suggests that, in a case like\n   <em>\n    Gratz\n   </em>\n   , a class member who supports affirmative action may be \"satisfied with the status quo\" but still not be \"opposed to the recognition of the\n   <em>\n    right\n   </em>\n   not to be discriminated against.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1347. But that ostensible distinction is not discernible anywhere in Rule 23. At any rate, the distinction depends on the level of generality at which one conceives of the right: a class member supportive of affirmative action might well oppose \"recognition of the right not to be discriminated against\" when it specifically concerns an asserted right to strict race neutrality. The suggested distinction between supporting the status quo and opposing the right is elusive in this case too. Indeed, our colleague says that there is \"hardly a differen[ce]\" between \"people who support[ ] the Government's challenged policy\" and people who \"have moral/religious objections to abortion.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1342.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   The upshot is that, in a Rule 23(b)(2) action, there is no fixed requirement to give absent class members who may be ideologically opposed to the case the effective equivalent of an opt-out from the action. After all, in a (b)(2) case, an \"injunction prohibiting a defendant's action against 'the class as a whole' would halt the action\n   <em>\n    regardless whether some of\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    those affected might have withdrawn from the suit if given the option\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Richards v.

While our colleague does not indicate what would be a proper class definition in this case, he believes the class cannot include pregnant minors who oppose abortion on moral or religious grounds. But a class definition that excludes persons based on their ideological convictions would necessarily turn on a person's subjective (and possibly unannounced) beliefs. Such a definition would be, in the parlance of class actions, \"unascertainable\" or \"indefinite,\" because membership is not readily discernable by objective criteria.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   1 Rubenstein, Newberg on Class Actions \u00a7 3:3 ;\n   <em>\n    City Select Auto Sales Inc. v.

Consider the class's core claim: that the ORR Director's veto power, exercised as a ban, violates the class members' protected right to choose to terminate their pregnancies before viability. That policy applies on uniform grounds applicable to every member of the class, regardless of the circumstances of her pregnancy. Not only do all class members present the same challenge to the policy, but there also is no evident variation among them concerning their ultimate entitlement to relief: if any person in the class has a meritorious claim, they all do.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-157\">\n   Correspondingly, the government's arguments in defending against that claim cut across the entire class. The government maintains that denying a pregnant minor the choice to obtain a pre-viability abortion while in ORR custody works no deprivation of her due process rights because she can seek to voluntarily depart the United States or she might be released to a sponsor.

But to destroy typicality, a distinction must differentiate the \"\n   <em>\n    claims or defenses\n   </em>\n   \" of the representatives from those of the class. Fed. R. Civ.

Though absent class members may elect to exercise their choice in a different manner than Doe and Roe, the claims and defenses of the representatives are substantially-arguably entirely-identical to those of the class.

R. Civ. P. 23(a)(1). The government, though, does not argue that there is any numerosity problem with the class certified by the district court-i.e., pregnant unaccompanied minors who are or will be in ORR custody. And because we sustain that class definition, there is no numerosity objection to consider.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   It bears noting, though, that even as to a narrowed class of the kind contemplated by the government, the government's numerosity argument would run into significant questions about how to account for the class's size. The government stresses that it received 18 abortion requests in fiscal year 2017 and that classes containing fewer than 20 members generally fall short of the numerosity requirement.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't Br. 36. But there is nothing talismanic about the one-year timeframe hand-picked by the government. Indeed, there presumably would be a need to account for minors who will request abortions in\n   <em>\n    future\n   </em>\n   years. And classes including future claimants generally meet the numerosity requirement due to the \"impracticality of counting such class members, much less joining them.\" 1 Rubenstein, Newberg on Class Actions \u00a7 3:15 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Jones v.

And the government, as noted, accepts in this case that the undue-burden framework fully applies to unaccompanied minors in ORR custody.

Instead, as we explain below, our colleague believes the government should be permitted to delay access to a pre-viability abortion for a limited period in which it can continue searching for a suitable sponsor. But any delay, our colleague allows, must end if the pregnancy \"come[s] close to viability.\" Dissenting Op. 1334.

The government's effort to situate this case in that line of precedents is misconceived. This case does not involve government funding of abortions. A preexisting policy specifies that ORR funding is not to be used to pay for abortion services (except with the Director's approval in cases of rape, incest, or danger to the pregnant minor's life).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Memorandum from David Siegel, Acting Dir., Office of Refugee Resettlement, on Medical Services Requiring Heightened ORR Involvement (Mar. 21, 2008), https://perma.cc/LDN8-JNL5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   Jane Doe, for example, secured private funding and transportation for the abortion she sought to access. Yet Director Lloyd still denied the shelter authorization to permit Doe to leave the facility for the procedure. That is not a refusal to\n   <em>\n    fund\n   </em>\n   an abortion; it is a refusal to\n   <em>\n    allow\n   </em>\n   it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   The government seeks to invoke the funding decisions in service of the more abstract proposition that it need not \"commit any resources to facilitating abortions.\" Gov't Br. 40 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Webster\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6216899\" index=\"353\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/492/490/#p509\">\n    492 U.S. at 511\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6216899\" index=\"354\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/492/490/#p509\">\n    109 S.Ct. 3040\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ). But even if we assume that those decisions support a general \"non-facilitation\" principle, they are of no help to the government here. Consider the specific government conduct at issue. The government cites the need to \"maintain[ ] appropriate custody over the child\" during the procedure and \"monitor the child's health\" immediately afterward as a form of \"facilitation.\" Gov't Br. 40-41. But the government is obligated to \"maintain appropriate custody\" over a UAC and \"monitor the child's health\" regardless of any decision about an abortion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"355\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=6%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20279\">\n    6 U.S.C. \u00a7 279\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If those costs must be incurred regardless, and if a UAC secures private funding for an abortion procedure and associated travel expenses, what \"facilitation\" is left?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   The government points to a need to \"provide direction to the shelter on its role in connection with the procedure\" and to \"draft and execute approval documents\"-which appear to be essentially ministerial functions associated with any procedure for any medical condition. Gov't Br. 41. Such functions are a far cry from funding of abortions. And when we consider the Supreme Court's funding decisions alongside its decisions establishing a constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy pre-viability, we do not read the former decisions to mean that the government can compel a minor to carry her pregnancy to term against her wishes so that the government can be relieved of a self-imposed administrative requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-201\">\n   In that respect, the government's effort to extract its non-facilitation principle from the Supreme Court's funding decisions fundamentally misapprehends those precedents. Those decisions are rooted in the idea that, \"although government may not place obstacles in the path of a woman's exercise of her freedom of choice, it need not remove those obstacles\n   <em>\n    not of its own creation\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    McRae\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1787609\" index=\"356\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/448/297/#p317\">\n    448 U.S. at 316\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1787609\" index=\"357\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/448/297/#p317\">\n    100 S.Ct. 2671\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). Here, though, the government asserts that it need not remove obstacles that\n   <em>\n    are\n   </em>\n   of its own creation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   The \"facilitation\" the government says it wants to avoid involves constraints it imposed on itself: an unaccompanied minor's abortion hinges on ORR's drafting and executing approval documents only because ORR itself has conditioned abortion access on its execution of approval documents. But if the government could create such a requirement for itself and then refuse to satisfy it as a form of \"non-facilitation,\" the right to terminate a pregnancy before viability could be entirely subsumed by the principle recognized in the funding cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-203\">\n   To say that the government has an interest in declining to satisfy self-imposed constraints on abortion, then, would be to say that it has a cognizable interest in blocking abortion. That is, whereas the funding cases involved an interest in not \"facilitating\" abortion in the sense of not\n   <em>\n    affirmatively funding\n   </em>\n   abortion, here, the claimed interest in not \"facilitating\" an abortion amounts to an interest in not\n   <em>\n    allowing\n   </em>\n   abortion. But as the Supreme Court's precedents establish, a \"purpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion\" is by definition an impermissible, \"undue burden.\"\n   <em>\n    Stenberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9414367\" index=\"358\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/914/#p921\">\n    530 U.S. at 921\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9414367\" index=\"359\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/914/#p921\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Casey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480969\" index=\"360\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/833/#p879\">\n    505 U.S. at 877\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480969\" index=\"361\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/833/#p879\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2791\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (plurality)).

They instead ask for the government to step out of the way. We thus cannot accept the government's effort to reconceive of ORR's no-exceptions ban on access to abortion as a mere refusal to \"facilitate\" abortion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-206\">\n   ii. What the government deems \"facilitation\" that it wants to steer clear of giving to an unaccompanied minor, moreover, is something it willingly gives to all others in federal custody. Pregnant adults in immigration custody are held by DHS, which allows access to abortion, as does the Bureau of Prisons for federal inmates.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ICE Guidelines, Detention Standard 4.4, Medical Care, https://www.ice.gov/doclib/detention-standards/2011/4-4.pdf;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"369\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=28%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%20551.23\">\n    28 C.F.R. \u00a7 551.23\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The government, then, is sensitive to the asserted burden of \"facilitating\" abortions solely when it comes to\n   <em>\n    minors\n   </em>\n   in immigration custody. The result is that a 17-year-old (or even someone considerably younger) is compelled to carry her pregnancy to term against her wishes,\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Doe v. ORR\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12516173\" index=\"370\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/884/269/\">\n    884 F.3d 269\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (5th Cir. 2018) (per curiam) (14-year-old pregnant\n   minor in ORR custody), whereas an 18-year-old can choose otherwise.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-207\">\n   Consider the circumstances of Jane Doe's pregnancy. Recall that Director Lloyd barred her Texas shelter from releasing her for a (privately funded) abortion even though she qualified for an abortion under Texas law. At the time, she was at least 14 weeks pregnant and 17 years old. She turned 18 several weeks later, at a time she still would have been pregnant had ORR's refusal to allow an abortion stood. But while the federal government permits a person in immigration custody at age 18 to obtain an abortion, Doe's pregnancy presumably would have become post-viability by that time, such that her right to seek a pre-viability abortion would have expired. The government's policy thus would have denied her access to an abortion while she had that right, only to allow her access when it was too late.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-208\">\n   Or consider the implications of the government's on-and-off interest in \"non-facilitation\" if Doe's pregnancy still would have been\n   <em>\n    pre\n   </em>\n   -viability when she turned 18. In that situation, ORR's policy would have simply forced her to\n   <em>\n    wait\n   </em>\n   a significant number of weeks to obtain a pre-viability abortion, pending her inevitable transfer from one form of government custody (ORR) in which abortion is barred to another (DHS) in which it is allowed. Why require her to wait several weeks for a later-term abortion that is sure to occur rather than permit her to obtain it earlier in her pregnancy? Solely so that the procedure then happens on DHS's watch rather than ORR's.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-209\">\n   Those unjustified and anomalous disparities substantially undercut the government's reliance on its ostensible interest in non-facilitation. And they reinforce the inapplicability of the funding decisions in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-210\">\n   b.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-211\">\n   The government next contends that, even if ORR's policy works as a ban on access to an abortion rather than as a mere withholding of funding, an unaccompanied minor can easily avoid the ban by seeking voluntary departure from the United States. And because she could readily avoid the ORR ban by making use of voluntary departure, the argument goes, the ban does not impose any cognizable burden-much less an undue burden-on her choice to terminate her pregnancy. The government's argument is misguided.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-212\">\n   To see why, think about the government's argument in the context of the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt\n   </em>\n   , --- U.S. ----,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598075\" index=\"371\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2292/\">\n    136 S. Ct. 2292\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12598075\" index=\"372\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/2292/\">\n    195 L.Ed.2d 665\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016). There, the Court invalidated Texas laws that had the effect of significantly reducing the number of available abortion providers in the State and forcing women to travel longer distances for an abortion without an offsetting health benefit. The Court held that the laws imposed an undue burden on access to abortion. But under the logic of the voluntary-departure argument the government now advances here, the Texas laws struck down in\n   <em>\n    Whole Woman's Health\n   </em>\n   in fact imposed no undue burden because women desiring an abortion could always travel to another state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-213\">\n   That sort of argument presumably could not have carried the day in\n   <em>\n    Whole Woman's Health\n   </em>\n   . And the government's voluntary-departure argument cannot carry the day here either. A state could not ban abortions outright on the theory that pregnant women can just go elsewhere. And the federal government has no greater leeway to ban abortions on the theory that pregnant women can go elsewhere via voluntary departure. In a number of respects, in fact, the voluntary-departure argument pressed by the government here is even\n   <em>\n    less\n   </em>\n   tenable than an (already-unacceptable) argument that the Texas laws invalidated in\n   <em>\n    Whole Woman's Health\n   </em>\n   should have been sustained because a person could leave the State.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-214\">\n   To begin with, the government's voluntary-departure argument is grounded in an assumption that an unaccompanied minor can easily avoid the ORR ban by simply departing the country. The ready ability to leave the jurisdiction may be true of a Texas resident: she would be free to leave the State (at least as a legal matter) and go elsewhere to access an abortion. Voluntary departure, though, does not work that way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-215\">\n   Recall that voluntary departure is a form of immigration relief granted only at the discretion of the government.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   p. 1302,\n   <em>\n    supra\n   </em>\n   ; 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1229c(a)(1) (\"The Attorney General\n   <em>\n    may\n   </em>\n   permit an alien to voluntarily depart ....\" (emphasis added)). That is because voluntary departure leaves an individual better off than if she were removed from the country.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Dada\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677357\" index=\"373\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/1/#p8\">\n    554 U.S. at 8\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3677357\" index=\"374\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/554/1/#p8\">\n    128 S.Ct. 2307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . So whereas a Texas resident can leave the State without needing any approval, an unaccompanied minor could obtain voluntary departure only if the government grants it. Voluntary departure, then, is not a freely available escape hatch from a government veto on abortion. It is instead a second government veto.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-216\">\n   Relatedly, a Texas resident could choose how soon to leave the State to access an abortion elsewhere. That is significant because the right to a pre-viability abortion has an inherent expiration date. And even before that date, forcing a person to delay obtaining an abortion itself entails an escalating burden and risk over time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-217\">\n   With voluntary departure, though, it is not just that the government can choose when (and whether) to grant relief. It is also that the government has given no sense of how long the process can (or usually does) take from the time a person seeks the relief to the time the arrangements can come into order for her departure to another country. The process might well take considerable time in a context in which time is of the essence. In the case of Jane Doe, for instance, government correspondence in the record observed that her voluntary departure case was \"not likely to be far [along] at all given [her] recent referral date\" to ORR, indicating that voluntary departure, though possible, is far from instantly available. Email from Jonathan White, Deputy Dir. for Children's Programs, to Scott Lloyd, Dir., Office of Refugee Resettlement (Sept. 22, 2017), P.A. 26.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-218\">\n   What is more, any suggestion that a ban on abortion works no impermissible burden because a person can freely go elsewhere necessarily assumes the availability of abortion in the destination. That might be true of a Texas resident traveling to another state. But that is not true in the case of a pregnant unaccompanied minor in ORR custody: even assuming the government were to grant her voluntary departure and could expeditiously arrange for her return to her country of origin, she very likely could not obtain an abortion there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-219\">\n   That is because virtually all minors in ORR custody-more than 90%-come from Honduras, Guatemala, or El Salvador, the so-called Northern Triangle countries.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ORR Fact Sheet 2. Abortion is criminalized in all three countries, so much so that only Guatemala even provides an express exception for a threat to the life of the pregnant woman.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   World Health Org., Global Abortion Policies Database, https://abortion-policies.srhr.org/ (last accessed May 14, 2019);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Immigrant Rights Advocates Amicus Br. 4, 18. It is no\n   surprise, then, that the government conceded in Jane Doe's case that abortion would have been unavailable to her in her country of origin. In light of the unavailability of abortion in unaccompanied minors' countries of origin, the supposed accessibility of voluntary departure could not be seen to alleviate the burden imposed by ORR's ban.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-220\">\n   Finally, even if voluntary departure would in fact pave the way for a UAC to obtain an abortion in her country of origin, it comes at a significant cost. Voluntary departure requires withdrawing any claims for other forms of immigration relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"375\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=8%20C.F.R.%20%C2%A7%201240.26\">\n    8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1240.26\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . And according to ORR, \"[m]any unaccompanied alien children meet conditions that make them eligible for legal relief to remain in the United States including[ ] but not limited to asylum; special visas for children who have been abused, neglected[,] or abandoned by the parents or guardian; special visas for victims of severe forms of trafficking and other types of crime; or adjustment of status for those who have a legal resident or citizen family member.\" ORR, UAC Services;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Immigrant Rights Advocates Amicus Br. 4, 17-23. In that context, requiring an unaccompanied minor to carry her pregnancy to term unless she waives any claim for relief to stay in the United States is itself a substantial burden on her exercise of her rights.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Garza v. Hargan\n   </em>\n   , No. 17-5236,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"376\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2017%20WL%209854555\">\n    2017 WL 9854555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3-4 (D.C.

Recall that she became pregnant as the result of rape, but Director Lloyd still refused to authorize an abortion, forcing her to go to court to obtain an order (over the government's opposition) enabling her to terminate her pregnancy. She ultimately received a grant of asylum entitling her to stay in the United States. According to the government's voluntary-departure theory, she should have been forced to choose between (i) carrying her unwanted pregnancy to term even though it resulted from rape, and (ii) returning to her country of origin, a place where, according to the government's own determination in granting her asylum, she faced a well-founded fear of persecution. Putting her to that choice, to say the least, amounts to a \"substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion.\"\n   <em>\n    Stenberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9414367\" index=\"377\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/914/#p921\">\n    530 U.S. at 921\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9414367\" index=\"378\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/914/#p921\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Casey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480969\" index=\"379\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/833/#p879\">\n    505 U.S. at 877\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1480969\" index=\"380\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/505/833/#p879\">\n    112 S.Ct. 2791\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (plurality)).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-222\">\n   For those reasons, we cannot accept the government's effort to justify ORR's ban on access to abortions on the theory that unaccompanied minors can voluntarily depart the country. The undue-burden framework has never been thought to tolerate any burden on abortion the government imposes simply because women can leave the jurisdiction. That is especially so for voluntary departure, which: is granted only at the government's discretion; may not come soon enough even if awarded; is exceedingly unlikely to enable an unaccompanied minor to obtain an abortion in her country of origin in any event; and requires abandoning potentially viable claims of entitlement to stay in the United States.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-223\">\n   c.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-224\">\n   The government's last defense involves the prospect that an unaccompanied minor could be released to a sponsor, at which point ORR would no longer prevent her from obtaining an abortion. Because of that possibility, the government argues, the ban on accessing an abortion while in ORR custody does not impose an undue burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-225\">\n   i. The government's sponsorship argument, in our view, is ultimately no more persuasive than its voluntary-departure one. Those arguments share important\n   parallels. In both, the central idea is that an unaccompanied minor may find herself no longer in ORR custody-either because she voluntarily departs the country or because she is released to a sponsor-in which event she would be free to access an abortion without the burden of ORR's policy. Some of the same deficiencies that require rejecting the government's voluntary-departure argument also undermine its sponsorship argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-226\">\n   First, as with voluntary departure, sponsorship is not simply there for a UAC's taking. Rather, release to a sponsor is at the discretion of the government and is contingent on factors outside the UAC's control-most importantly, the existence of a willing and qualified sponsor. The process of approving a suitable sponsor is understandably an involved one. As ORR explains, \"the safe and timely release of an unaccompanied alien child from ORR custody involves many steps including: the identification of sponsors; the submission by a sponsor of the application for release and supporting documentation; the evaluation of the suitability of the sponsor, including verification of the sponsor's identity and relationship to the child, background checks, and in some cases home studies; and planning for post-release.\" ORR Guide \u00a7 2.1.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-227\">\n   As with voluntary departure, moreover, there is no guarantee that release to a sponsor-if it occurs at all-would happen in a timely fashion, even though the right to a pre-viability abortion carries a finite endpoint and its delayed recognition entails an accumulating burden and risk over time. According to recent ORR data, the average length of time a UAC spends in ORR custody is roughly 90 days. ORR Fact Sheet 2. And because that is merely an average, a sizable share of unaccompanied minors will spend more time than that in ORR custody before any release to a sponsor, with some never released to a sponsor because a suitable one is never found.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-228\">\n   Jane Doe, for instance, was released to a sponsor after months in ORR custody, at a time when she would have been at least some 26 weeks pregnant had she not been permitted to terminate her pregnancy under court order. And Jane Poe remained in ORR custody for approximately one year without ORR ever locating a suitable sponsor.\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Santos v.

Va. 2017) (no release for 29 months).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-229\">\n   In defending its sponsorship argument, the government relies on Supreme Court decisions sustaining judicial-bypass regimes that can impose some delays on a minor's ability to obtain an abortion absent parental involvement. The government notes that, in one decision, the Court upheld against a facial challenge a bypass procedure for minors that could have taken up to 22 days to complete (in an improbable, \"worst-case analysis that may never occur\").\n   <em>\n    Akron Ctr. for Reproductive Health\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6217149\" index=\"382\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/497/502/#p511\">\n    497 U.S. at 514\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6217149\" index=\"383\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/497/502/#p511\">\n    110 S.Ct. 2972\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Here, though, the average length of time an unaccompanied minor remains in ORR custody before release to a sponsor is more than four times that number of days; and the worst-case scenario is\n   <em>\n    no\n   </em>\n   release,\n   <em>\n    ever\n   </em>\n   (at least until age 18, at which point a person would be transferred to DHS custody as an adult).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-230\">\n   Apart from the arithmetic, there is a more fundamental flaw in the government's effort to analogize the time before release to a sponsor to the time to secure a judicial bypass. The government does not contend only that, for that subset of minors who can gain placement with a sponsor within a given period (e.g., in less than 22 days), it would be constitutional to delay access to an abortion to them for that time. Instead, the government's argument extends\n   to all minors in ORR custody, regardless of whether they are ever released to a sponsor. In the government's apparent view, the possibility that\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   minor could be released to a sponsor quickly enough to obtain a pre-viability abortion justifies a ban on\n   <em>\n    every\n   </em>\n   minor for the entire time she is in ORR custody. Thus, Jane Poe, for whom a suitable sponsor was never found, can be compelled to carry to term a pregnancy resulting from rape, because someone else might be more fortunate in securing release to a sponsor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-231\">\n   In other words, that lightning might strike for\n   <em>\n    some\n   </em>\n   , the government evidently believes, means it can deny an abortion to\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   . That of course cannot be so. Under that logic, a state could enforce a blanket requirement of parental consent even without affording any judicial bypass because at least some parents might change their minds.\n   <em>\n    But see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bellotti\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184603\" index=\"384\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/443/622/#p643\">\n    443 U.S. at 643\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184603\" index=\"385\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/443/622/#p643\">\n    99 S.Ct. 3035\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (opinion of Powell, J.);\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184603\" index=\"386\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/443/622/#p643\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184603\" index=\"386\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/443/622/#p643\">\n    at 654\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184603\" index=\"387\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/443/622/#p643\">\n    99 S.Ct. 3035\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (opinion of Stevens, J.). The abstract possibility of release to a sponsor thus affords no basis to deny access to abortion across the board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-232\">\n   It bears emphasis, moreover, that the judicial-bypass context fundamentally differs from the sponsorship context. The delay from a judicial bypass is justified by the need to ensure that a minor is sufficiently mature to decide to terminate her pregnancy without parental involvement.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184603\" index=\"388\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/443/622/#p643\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184603\" index=\"388\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/443/622/#p643\">\n    at 636\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184603\" index=\"389\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/443/622/#p643\">\n    99 S.Ct. 3035\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (opinion of Powell, J.). That interest was served in Jane Doe's case, for instance, when she obtained a bypass from a Texas court that found her competent to make her own choice to terminate her pregnancy. By contrast, ORR's policy here has been justified only on the basis of the government's interest in avoiding \"facilitation.\" And nothing in the record suggests that ORR had in mind any potential benefits of sponsorship for unaccompanied minors when it instituted and applied the ban.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-233\">\n   Nor does the structure of ORR's policy suggest any aim to provide pregnant UACs with any benefits of sponsorship when deciding whether to terminate a pregnancy. The search for a sponsor begins for\n   <em>\n    every\n   </em>\n   unaccompanied minor at the moment she (or he) enters ORR custody, and there is no intensified effort to identify a sponsor just because a minor is pregnant and considers an abortion. Plus, far from improving the conditions for a minor's decision-making, barring abortion access unless a sponsor is found would deny some minors the ability to make a decision at all (in cases like Jane Poe's, in which no suitable sponsor is identified before viability). When Director Lloyd explained his denial of Poe's request for an abortion, he thus made no mention of sponsorship or its potential advantages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-234\">\n   Our dissenting colleague suggests that, regardless of whether Director Lloyd (or anyone in the government) considered the advantages of sponsorship when establishing or implementing the ORR policy, the government in its briefing before us has now referenced the \"benefits of adult guidance\" afforded by sponsorship and has argued \"that sponsorship does provide that benefit to a pregnant minor.\" Dissenting Op. 1349. That may be so, but it is beside the point. Everyone agrees that\n   <em>\n    sponsorship\n   </em>\n   benefits UACs: that is why the government seeks release to a sponsor for all UACs, pregnant or not. The salient question, though, is whether the\n   <em>\n    challenged ORR policy\n   </em>\n   -i.e., the ban on abortion access-is adequately aimed to (or operates to) realize those benefits of sponsorship for unaccompanied minors, even though it denies them abortion access without regard to the prospects of their release to a suitable sponsor. For the reasons explained, we think the answer is no.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-235\">\n   In short, nothing in the ORR policy's design or operation suggests that its purpose or effect is to confer upon UACs deciding whether to terminate a pregnancy the benefit of adult consultation and support. The government's justification for the policy instead has consistently been the same one it invokes with respect to voluntary departure-i.e., the interest in withholding government \"facilitation\" of abortions while a pregnant minor is in ORR custody. In the context of that interest, the government can no more deny her abortion access based on the abstract possibility of sponsorship than it can do so based on the abstract availability of voluntary departure.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-236\">\n   ii. The government suggests a fallback variation of its sponsorship argument in its reply brief: even if the abstract possibility of release to a sponsor does not allow the government to bar abortion access outright in all instances, the district court at least should have narrowed its preliminary injunction to give the government additional time to find a sponsor \"when it is expeditious.\" Gov't Reply Br. 18. Our dissenting colleague accepts a form of that argument. In his view, when a UAC \"says she wants an abortion,\" the government should be allowed to delay abortion access for a \"limited time\" while it continues searching for a sponsor; but the delay in all events would need to end before the pregnancy \"come[s] close to viability,\" at which point the government would have to allow an abortion. Dissenting Op. 1348-49. Our colleague does not specify the length of the \"limited time,\" but says that it would need to be \"expeditious\" and that \"up to a three-week delay ha[s] been recognized as expeditious\" in the context of a judicial bypass.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6184603\" index=\"390\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/443/622/#p643\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   That species of fallback argument does not advance the government's cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-237\">\n   As an initial matter, the government has not provided a sound reason for any delay in the circumstances of this case, as we have already rejected its reliance on the one interest it presses-non-facilitation. And in any event, it is far from clear that the government could justify delaying abortion access for\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   minors for an additional period of up to three weeks on the mere chance that placement with a sponsor could occur in that window for\n   <em>\n    someone\n   </em>\n   . The government would have been looking for a sponsor for every minor, all along, and would continue to do so with the same intensity regardless of an abortion request. There is then no reason to suppose that the search will happen to yield a sponsor in an additional three weeks often enough to justify imposing a blanket delay of that duration-and the government has not attempted to make any argument or showing to that effect.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-238\">\n   Our dissenting colleague nonetheless asserts that the sponsorship process is in fact affected by an abortion decision. He supposes that the government's search for a sponsor \"surely\" is \"accelerated\" when an unaccompanied minor says she wants an abortion. Dissenting Op. 1348. But there is no reason to think our colleague's speculation is accurate, and every reason to think it is not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-239\">\n   The government has never suggested, in any materials submitted in this case or in any of its published guidance on the sponsorship process, that its efforts to find a sponsor go from half-hearted to full-hearted if it learns that a particular UAC desires an abortion. Rather, the imperative to find a suitable sponsor exists for\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   unaccompanied minors from the moment they enter ORR custody until a sponsor is found because release to a sponsor is desirable in all instances, regardless of pregnancy (or abortion). The government thus continued trying to find a sponsor for Jane\n   Doe after she obtained an abortion, with no evident deceleration in its (eventually successful) efforts. Indeed, even as to a minor who is pregnant, release to a sponsor presumably would be at a premium not just if she says she wants an abortion, but also if she does\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   : she can then have the direct assistance and support of a family member or other responsible adult as she proceeds to delivery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-240\">\n   Our colleague's proposed up-to-three-week delay when a minor says she wants an abortion has no relation to anything we know about the sponsorship process. Though the Supreme Court upheld a bypass mechanism that could take up to three weeks to complete in a worst-case circumstance,\n   <em>\n    Akron Ctr. for Reproductive Health\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6217149\" index=\"391\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/497/502/#p511\">\n    497 U.S. at 514\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6217149\" index=\"392\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/497/502/#p511\">\n    110 S.Ct. 2972\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the delay was justified by the particular interest served by the bypass and the time needed for that process to run its course. There is nothing sacrosanct, though, about a three-week waiting period. The Court did not hold that\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   three-week delay advancing\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   interest to\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   degree is invariably constitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-241\">\n   Here, without knowing whether, why, or how often an extra three weeks is likely to result in placement of minors with sponsors, we cannot weigh a three-week delay's putative benefits against its burdens.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Whole Woman's Health\n   </em>\n   , 136 S. Ct. at 2309. The three-week figure has simply been plucked from the judicial-bypass context and rotely transposed here, rather than justified based on a three-week delay's purported benefits pertaining to identifying a sponsor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-242\">\n   At any rate, even assuming the government\n   <em>\n    could\n   </em>\n   justify some additional period of delaying access to an abortion that is tied to its efforts to identify a sponsor, the district court had no obligation to fashion its interim injunction around that possibility. True, \"an injunction must be narrowly tailored to remedy the harm shown.\"\n   <em>\n    Gulf Oil Corp. v. Brock\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3604466,1526915\" index=\"393\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/778/834/\">\n    778 F.2d 834\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 842 (D.C. Cir. 1985). That principle, however, does not require district courts enjoining unconstitutional government policies to fashion narrower, ostensibly permissible policies from whole cloth. After all, what might a narrower policy look like here? The government never said, and the district court did not need to propose a range of conceivable polices to the government until the government found one to its liking.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-243\">\n   For instance, perhaps in lieu of the blanket ban the government sought to defend, it might consider a regime of the kind hypothesized by our dissenting colleague, under which it would delay access to an abortion for a given period in which it might somehow augment its ongoing efforts to find a sponsor, with viability as a backstop. Our colleague traces that approach to then-Judge Kavanaugh's opinion in an earlier stage of the proceedings in this case. Dissenting Op. 1347. But after that opinion, the government at no point asked the district court in the ensuing proceedings to consider crafting a remedy that would give the government some extra time period to find a sponsor upon learning of a UAC's interest in an abortion. Nor did the government suggest the contours of any such approach. The district court, then, did not abuse its discretion by leaving such a regime out of its preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-244\">\n   What, for instance, would be an appropriate amount of additional time to identify a sponsor? And if the start time, per our colleague's proposal, is when a minor requests an abortion, would the extra time to find a sponsor vary depending on the amount of time remaining until viability, which in turn might vary depending on the particularities of state law? Additionally, would there be a fixed period of delay for\n   all unaccompanied minors regardless of the prospects of identifying a sponsor, as our dissenting colleague appears to presume, or would delay be warranted only for those minors for whom the prospect of expeditiously identifying a sponsor is sufficiently promising? If the latter, by what criteria would those minors be identified? And by what proper purpose would the government justify an additional period of delay, given that, as explained, it has yet to assert such a purpose?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-245\">\n   This case, in short, is not one in which crafting a narrower remedy is a \"relatively simple matter.\"\n   <em>\n    Ayotte v.

Confronted with a blunt policy barring access to an abortion across the board for anyone in ORR custody, the district court understandably issued a corresponding remedy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-246\">\n   d.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-247\">\n   i. The district court's remedy does not compel \"abortion-on-demand,\" contrary to the government's (and our dissenting colleague's) characterization.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Gov't Reply Br. 14; Dissenting Op. 1349. With or without the preliminary injunction, an unaccompanied minor can obtain an abortion only if state law permits it. That is why Jane Doe needed to obtain a judicial bypass from a Texas court. A regime in which an unaccompanied minor needs to secure a judicial bypass under Texas law cannot be seen as \"abortion-on-demand\" unless Texas law itself is seen to allow abortion-on-demand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-248\">\n   What is more, even if we set aside the need to satisfy state law and consider only the federal government's efforts to add its own constraints, nothing in our analysis necessarily prevents the government from attempting to regulate UACs' abortion access under a different policy consistent with the Supreme Court's precedents. If the government wishes to devise a narrower policy than a blanket veto and ban (including one tethered to the sponsorship process), it can do so and then test the policy in the courts. But until then, the district court is not obligated to undertake the task of chiseling from the government's across-the-board ban a different policy the government never identified, endorsed, or defended.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-249\">\n   ii. As something of a last resort, the government asserts that upholding the district court's decision \"would constitutionally mandate what would amount to abortion tourism, where minors who cannot obtain abortions lawfully in their country of nationality demand abortion services at our border or upon illegal entry to our country.\" Gov't Br. 45. The government's supposition that the possibility of a lawful abortion would alone cause unaccompanied minors to attempt the journey here is unsupported.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-250\">\n   As ORR itself explains, \"[u]naccompanied alien children have multiple inter-related reasons for undertaking the difficult journey of traveling to the United States, which may include rejoining family already in the United States, escaping violent\n   communities or abusive family relationships in their home country, or finding work to support their families in the home country.\" ORR, UAC Services. And the \"age of these individuals, their separation from parents and relatives, and the hazardous journey they take make unaccompanied alien children especially vulnerable to human trafficking, exploitation[,] and abuse.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1333702\" index=\"401\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/513/454/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-251\">\n   Those perils have become only more pronounced. A recent letter from the DHS Secretary to Congress advises that \"[r]eports of violence and sexual assault along the route are now pervasive, meaning that many arriving migrants require especially focused care. In some cases, girls as young as 10 years old in DHS custody require pregnancy tests so we can make sure they get essential medical support.\" Nielsen Letter 2. That hazardous journey for minors is not \"tourism,\" much less \"tourism\" to \"demand abortion.\" Gov't Br. 45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-252\">\n   More fundamentally, even if the availability of constitutional rights in this country affords an inducement to attempt that journey, we are unable to accept the government's argument. It is difficult to imagine the government arguing, say, that unaccompanied minors should be denied the right to freely worship while in ORR custody because those denied religious liberty in their native countries might otherwise be enticed to come to the United States. And correspondingly, we cannot accept the suggestion that minors in ORR custody should be compelled to carry pregnancies to term against their wishes-even in cases of rape-so that others will be deterred from desiring to come here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-253\">\n   To be sure, the \"right to an abortion\" is viewed to have a \"controversial nature,\" as to which people \"sincerely hold directly opposing views.\"\n   <em>\n    Stenberg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9414367\" index=\"402\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/914/#p921\">\n    530 U.S. at 920-21\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9414367\" index=\"403\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/914/#p921\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We see no basis to set aside the district court's assessment of those remaining preliminary-injunction factors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-258\">\n   The government argues that the plaintiffs' class will not suffer irreparable\n   harm absent a preliminary injunction. Noting the district court's grant of temporary restraining orders to Jane Doe, Jane Poe, and Jane Moe, the government contends that the court could similarly deal with abortion requests on a rolling, emergency basis as they arise in the course of the litigation. But it is precisely because of a risk of irreparable harm that an individual litigant would be entitled to emergency relief in a given case. And the government provides no reason why the district court was required to privilege one form of interim relief that individual class members could seek in the future (one-by-one temporary restraining orders) over another form of interim relief that the class seeks now (a classwide preliminary injunction). Efficiency considerations, if nothing else, plainly favor the latter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-259\">\n   Next, the government contends that the \"government (and public) have a legitimate and significant interest in protecting potential life and therefore refusing to affirmatively facilitate abortions that the Constitution does not require.\" Gov't Br. 49. And the public interest, the government continues, \"weighs against incentivizing illegal immigration.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524648\" index=\"409\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/304/145/#p150\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The first argument assumes the correctness of the government's position on the merits (which we have found is unlikely to succeed). And as to the second argument, there is no evidence supporting the idea that pregnant unaccompanied minors make the journey to the country and attempt to (unlawfully) enter solely for the sake of obtaining a (lawful) abortion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-260\">\n   Finally, the government submits that \"the public interest weighs heavily in favor of allowing ORR to fulfill its statutory obligations,\" and notes that \"ORR must assume a\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   parent role for [pregnant UACs], who often lack the maturity to independently make such crucial life decisions.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 49-50. Consequently, the government contends, it \"is in the public interest to allow ORR to fulfill that obligation, including by assisting these minors with navigating complex moral, mental, and physical issues they face.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 50. But ORR's policies are not calculated to assist minors with navigating the decision whether to continue (or terminate) a pregnancy. Instead, ORR's policies aim to block a decision in one direction alone until ORR can absolve itself of its de-facto parental role via either voluntary departure or release to a sponsor (or release to DHS when a minor turns 18). There was no reversible error in the district court's consideration of the public interest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-261\">\n   * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-262\">\n   Because the plaintiffs have made a sufficient showing that the various preliminary-injunction factors weigh in their favor, we affirm the district court's order preliminarily enjoining the government from interfering with unaccompanied minors' access to a pre-viability abortion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-263\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-264\">\n   We consider next that portion of the district court's order enjoining the government from revealing (or from forcing the plaintiffs to reveal) \"the fact of their pregnancies and/or abortion decisions to anyone.\" Prelim Inj. Order (Apr. 16, 2018), G.C.A. 275. The plaintiffs allege that ORR maintained a practice of disclosing, or of coercing class members to disclose, information about their abortion decisions and pregnancies to their parents (and, in some cases, to potential sponsors). They argued that the disclosure practices violate their rights under the First and Fifth Amendments. The district court evidently agreed, and the government now appeals that aspect of the preliminary injunction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-265\">\n   We decline to reach the merits of that challenge, however, because we lack an\n   adequate understanding of the content of the disclosure policies we would be charged with reviewing. The district court, in the portion of its decision granting certification of the class, noted that the \"[p]laintiffs have offered evidence to support their contention that\" ORR maintains \"a series of restrictions that apply to all pregnant UCs in its custody,\" including \"a parental notification requirement that cannot be bypassed.\"\n   <em>\n    Garza\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524648\" index=\"410\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/304/145/#p150\">\n    304 F. Supp. 3d at 156\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . But while the court observed that the plaintiffs had \"offered evidence\" supporting a parental notification requirement, the court did not make an ultimate finding on whether such a requirement in fact exists. Nor did the court make findings about the parameters of the alleged notification requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-266\">\n   For instance, there is no finding or statement speaking to whether parental notification pertains to (or is triggered by) an abortion request, or whether notification may also encompass the fact of a minor's pregnancy regardless of an abortion request. There is also no finding addressing whether (and to what extent) ORR undertakes a case-by-case determination concerning a minor's best interests before notifying parents, as the government claims, or whether any notification instead occurs on a blanket basis. Nor is there a finding concerning whether and to what extent ORR is in the practice of disclosing abortion requests (or the fact of pregnancy) to prospective sponsors as well as parents, and whether the ORR disclosure practice is the same both pre- and post-viability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-267\">\n   The answers to those sorts of questions would inform the constitutional analysis and bear on its contours. And the answers would enable us to ensure that we avoid issuing an advisory opinion about aspects of an alleged disclosure policy that do not in fact exist. In addition, a remand would allow the district court to identify which of the plaintiffs' three constitutional theories about the alleged disclosure policies (a Fifth Amendment claim under\n   <em>\n    Planned Parenthood v. Casey\n   </em>\n   , a Fifth Amendment \"informational privacy\" claim, or a First Amendment claim) promises a likelihood of success on the merits and why. As it stands, the court's legal analysis speaks to ORR's challenged interference with abortion access without separately discussing the alleged disclosure polices. Nor did the decision address the other preliminary-injunction factors as they may specifically pertain to the alleged disclosure policies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-268\">\n   We appreciate the pressure on the district court to move with haste, particularly given the nature of the claims and the multiple prior rounds of emergency litigation. We also acknowledge the breadth of the legal issues raised-as the length of this opinion manifests-and the understandable desire to streamline the order. And the parties did not always draw clear distinctions between the access restriction and alleged disclosure mandate in their arguments.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-269\">\n   Nonetheless, we are unable to meaningfully review the portion of the district court's preliminary injunction addressed to the alleged disclosure policies without a more developed understanding of the content of those polices. We thus vacate the portion of the district court's order preliminarily enjoining the government from disclosing (or forcing class members to disclose) information related to their pregnancies and abortion decisions, so that the district court on remand can give a more fulsome account of its findings and conclusions in that regard.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-270\">\n   * * * * *\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-271\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the class certification order and the portions of the preliminary injunction enjoining obstructions to abortion access. We vacate\n   those portions of the order relating to ORR's alleged disclosure policies and remand for further explanation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-272\">\n   <em>\n    So ordered.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-273\">\n   Silberman, Senior Circuit Judge, dissenting:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-274\">\n   I should note at the outset my disagreement with the majority regarding the propriety of the district judge's certification of the class.

The crux of my dispute on this issue is that I believe that the class is much too broad; it should not include pregnant minors who do not wish an abortion, whether you refer to that as a violation of commonality, typicality, or adequacy. Indeed, I believe that the class not only violates Rule 23(a), it also violates the Constitution since it includes many class members who do not claim injury-in-fact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-275\">\n   But before I reach that matter, I also disagree with the majority regarding another constitutional question, as to whether this case is moot, because the class representatives' claims are moot, or whether mootness is avoided because of the exception for claims that are \"inherently transitory.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-276\">\n   Finally, since the majority decides these procedural questions contrary to my views and reaches the merits, so do I; for I disagree on the merits as well.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-277\">\n   <strong>\n    I.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-278\">\n   It is common ground in this case that the only relevant exception to the mootness doctrine is based on the inherently transitory exception. That is to say the\n   <em>\n    claims\n   </em>\n   must be inherently transitory. Generally, the cases in which Supreme Court majorities have recognized this exception have been cases in which the class members' alleged legal violations have, from the outset of the claim, been expected to last only days or a very brief period of time - too short a period for a conscientious district judge to be expected to rule on a motion for certification.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    County of Riverside v. McLaughlin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6216695\" index=\"417\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/500/44/#p51\">\n    500 U.S. 44\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 47, 50-52,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6216695\" index=\"418\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/500/44/#p51\">\n    111 S.Ct. 1661\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6216695\" index=\"419\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/500/44/#p51\">\n    114 L.Ed.2d 49\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1991). Therefore, even if the class representatives' claims are mooted, the class of plaintiffs remains so long as members still have live claims. Which presents the question: What period is too short? My colleagues put it in terms of whatever amount of time would be \"reasonable,\" keeping in mind the demands placed on a busy judge. I am afraid that is a way of turning any injunctive claim that is indefinite into an inherently transitory claim. The exception would swallow the rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-279\">\n   Determining whether a claim is\n   <em>\n    inherently\n   </em>\n   transitory requires us to judge whether the claim on its face (no matter when the certification motion is actually heard) was one that a hypothetical judge would not have had adequate time to hear and decide the certification issue. In other words, the claim must be evaluated\n   <em>\n    ex ante\n   </em>\n   - when made - not in the context of events that transpire after the claim. The words \"inherently transitory,\" therefore, necessarily suggest apparent fleeting claims. The Supreme Court recently seemed to indicate my analysis is correct - it said \"this doctrine has invariably focused on the fleeting nature of the challenged conduct giving rise to the claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Genesis Healthcare Corp. v.

Moreover, the number of variables implicit in that approach is inconsistent with the term \"inherently transitory.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Contractors' Labor Pool, Inc. v.

Op. at 1310-11. Yet the Appellees dispute quite vigorously the availability and operation of sponsorship and voluntary departure. Indeed, the district court's findings certainly suggest that these factors do not support the application of the exception. The court found sponsorship to be \"typically a lengthy, complex process involving multiple stages.\"\n   <em>\n    Garza v.

Nor do Appellees argue that sponsorship happens quickly,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Appellees' Br. 45, or suggest that voluntary departure is a significant option for pregnant minors,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    id.\n   </em>\n   at 44. Of course, there might be some movement out of the class, but that does not\n   <em>\n    ex ante\n   </em>\n   make the claims of putative class representatives fleeting for purposes of the inherently transitory exception.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-283\">\n   It should be recalled that the inherently transitory exception has a second requirement that there be a constant class of individuals with live claims (this is, of course, related to the Rule 23(a) numerosity requirement,\n   <em>\n    see infra\n   </em>\n   note 2). I have rather serious doubts that this prong is met either. The majority emphasizes that the Government does not contest this point, but since it goes to Article III standing, we have an obligation to examine the matter ourselves. The district court merely determined that \"the claims of numerous potential class members remain unaddressed.\"\n   <em>\n    Garza\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12524648\" index=\"426\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/304/145/#p150\">\n    304 F.

Similarly, Appellees rely on the large size of the class, but if I am correct that the class is much too large, this requirement also becomes problematic. The majority opinion, on the other hand, relies on a statement at oral argument that only \"about a dozen [minors] expressed an interest in abortion or related information\" in the six-month period after the issuance of the injunction. Op. at 1312. I do not think that such a small number is sufficient to assure the court of a continuing existence of a class of individuals with live claims for purposes of the inherently transitory exception, and we are obligated to be \"certain\" of the existence of a live class.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Gerstein v.

The facts, however, are quite similar to the original case,\n   <em>\n    Gerstein\n   </em>\n   , but since the average length of time of detention in\n   <em>\n    Preap\n   </em>\n   was one year, it can hardly be called fleeting, which is what Justice Thomas pointed out in his concurrence.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 976 (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment). That leads me to believe that although the plurality provided us with no analysis, its justification for ignoring the lengthy average time of detention was the Government's complete control of the timing of any removal - which, in some cases, could be fleeting. That isn't true in our case. Two factors affect the timing of the Appellees' claims - voluntary departure and sponsorship.

That many of the class members in our case have moral/religious objections to abortion is hardly a different point; it is not only implicit, it is obvious in today's world.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-289\">\n   In that regard, the majority ignores the independent obligation of the district court to assure itself of the propriety of class certification. Although, in my view, both the pleadings and common sense presented this issue, the Supreme Court has cautioned that \"sometimes it may be necessary for the court to probe behind the\n   pleadings before coming to rest on the certification question.\"\n   <em>\n    Falcon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6186289\" index=\"435\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/457/147/\">\n    457 U.S. at 160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6186289\" index=\"436\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/457/147/\">\n    102 S.Ct. 2364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Any court faithfully performing the \"rigorous analysis\" mandated by the Supreme Court should have anticipated and engaged with the obvious problems posed by this class.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6186289\" index=\"437\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/457/147/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6186289\" index=\"437\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/457/147/\">\n    at 161\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6186289\" index=\"438\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/457/147/\">\n    102 S.Ct. 2364\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . So, too, any district judge in the United States should have recognized that many pregnant minors who favored the Government's policy would have moral/religious reasons for doing so. In any event, the majority confronts the argument on its merits and dismisses it as mere value or ideological interests. Op. at 1318.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-290\">\n   The Government makes a related powerful argument with respect to adequacy: the class representatives, both of whom sought an abortion, cannot adequately represent the interests of pregnant minors who wish to carry their babies to birth. The majority's response is that the district judge's order ostensibly is also directed to the benefit of the minors who don't want an abortion. It states the Government is banned from interfering with pregnancy-related care. But that is obviously window dressing ; no one has been arguing that the Government has been derelict in providing care to those minors who wish to give birth.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-291\">\n   Of course, the adequacy of the class representatives is directly related to the question whether the class has a common legal interest. The Appellees contend that all pregnant minors - whether or not they want an abortion - are really aligned with the class representatives because the relevant constitutional right in their view is the right to\n   <em>\n    choose\n   </em>\n   whether or not to have an abortion. I think that confuses a political slogan\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   with a constitutional right. No one questions any woman's legal right to carry a fetus to birth; the only constitutional issue is whether there is a constitutional right to have an abortion under some circumstances. So it is misleading for Appellees to speak of a constitutional right to choose whether to carry a pregnancy to birth. No one, least of all the Government, threatens such a \"choice.\" The Appellees' articulation of constitutional rights carried over, for example, to the Second Amendment would be phrased as a\n   <em>\n    choice\n   </em>\n   whether to keep arms or not, implying a constitutional right\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   to keep arms - which would be ridiculous. The majority adopts the Appellees' choice theory: \"class members all assert a common entitlement to make that choice on their own, free from any veto power retained (unconstitutionally, the class says) by ORR.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Op. at 1314.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-292\">\n   As a consequence of its thinking, the majority treats pregnant minors who wish to deliver a baby - the much larger group - as merely indifferent to or uninterested in the class action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   It is claimed there is no conflict between those pregnant minors who wish to give birth and those who wish an abortion. Op. at 1313-19. In my view, given the fierce differences, based in part on religious beliefs, that divide people in the United States and all over the world on the morality of abortion, to blithely suggest that those pregnant minors who do not want an abortion are\n   merely uninterested in the Government's policy seems quite intolerant of religious views.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-293\">\n   Alternatively, the majority determines, even if some members of the class, hypothetically, are strongly opposed to abortion, there are two reasons to ignore their concerns. First, identification of those minors who have such convictions would not be easily ascertainable for the purpose of carving them out of the class action. That is so. But the inappropriateness of the class is not to be cured by carving out those with a hypothetical level of moral or religious opposition to abortion. It is sufficient to recognize, as apparently the majority does, that many persons, including presumably many of the pregnant minors, have these convictions. (Can one imagine how terrified pregnant alien minors would be if questioned about their views on the Government's policy?) After all, it is the plaintiff who bears the burden in a class certification proceeding to meet the requirements of Rule 23(a).\n   <em>\n    Richards v. Delta Air Lines, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3456764,6046701\" index=\"439\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/453/525/\">\n    453 F.3d 525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 529 (D.C. Cir. 2006). Thus, even if - which I do not advocate - minors with moral/religious convictions in favor of the policy should be excised from the class, it would be the Plaintiffs' burden to identify them, and since the majority acknowledges that would be virtually impossible, it is the Plaintiffs who do not satisfy their burden.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-294\">\n   It would be willful blindness not to recognize that any randomly selected group - particularly one drawn largely from countries with substantial Catholic populations - would include women who fiercely oppose abortion as murder. In other words, once it is realized - and I think we can take judicial notice of it - that a number of the pregnant minors are likely to have moral/religious convictions that abortion is murder, that is a powerful reason to conclude the class is improperly certified. But - and this is important - I do not argue that the class is improperly certified\n   <em>\n    only\n   </em>\n   because it includes minors who have moral/religious objections to abortion. That a number are likely to have religious objections just illustrates the lack of commonality.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-295\">\n   The second reason the majority brandishes is that mere ideological opposition - which apparently includes religious views - is not the kind of conflict of interest that threatens the class certification. Op. at 1317. Tell that to the bakers who risked sanctions for religious reasons, rather than bake a cake for a gay wedding. The Supreme Court was more sympathetic.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. v. Colo.

Indeed, the whole body of jurisprudence dealing with abortion is infused with religious views and secular values.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-296\">\n   The majority argues that because a (b)(2) class action has no \"opt-out\" requirement, we need not worry about the inclusion of members who do not belong and likely do not wish to be included in the class. But the justification for the lack of an opt-out right in a (b)(2) case is that \"injunctive relief benefits the entire class.\"\n   <em>\n    Richards\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3456764,6046701\" index=\"442\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/453/525/\">\n    453 F.3d at 530\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . That only holds true when the class is properly defined. Indeed, since (b)(2) class members lack the ability to opt out, the district court must be particularly vigilant in defining the class.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-297\">\n   To be sure, plain ideological considerations have been repeatedly held as insufficient to constitute injury-in-fact for standing purposes.\n   <em>\n    Sierra Club v.

But when one is placed in a class represented by political antagonists,\n   one's objection is not merely an abstract ideological concern.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-298\">\n   For instance, the majority's concept would permit a class of all federal government workers (approximately 3 million) if, let us say, Congress passed a law banning continuing government employment of individuals belonging to an organization that secretly supports ISIS or similar groups, and a class action based on the First Amendment was brought. All government employees, including persons employed in the CIA and the Defense Department, would have a \"choice\" whether or not to belong to such an organization, so their ideological opposition to the target organization supposedly would be irrelevant. According to the majority's reasoning, they would all be merely indifferent to the claims of the hypothetical class representatives. By the same token, a neo-Nazi group that brought that sort of class action could include all Jewish government employees, and a white supremacist class action could include African-Americans.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-299\">\n   In response to my hypothetical relating to a neo-Nazi First Amendment claim in the form of a class action that would include all federal employees, the majority points out that Jewish employees might have grounds to claim a conflict with the class because they would have to work alongside the neo-Nazis. (Why only Jewish employees? And would half-Jews qualify? And what about those employees who are working thousands of miles away from where the neo-Nazis wish to work?) I believe being associated in an action on behalf of the neo-Nazis is a good deal more troublesome than working in the same location.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-300\">\n   I can just imagine how the dissident groups in my examples would react when told they are part of the class. The majority suggests \"not to worry\" the dissident groups might never know they were included in the class action. Op. at 1318. I wouldn't bet on that. Indeed, the resulting publicity would horrify most of the unnamed members of the class. I think they would probably have a First Amendment freedom of association claim themselves, i.e., an objection to a governmentally imposed membership in a politically offensive class.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   Maximilian A. Grant, Comment,\n   <em>\n    The Right Not to Sue: A First Amendment Rationale for Opting Out of Mandatory Class Actions\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"449\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=63%20U.%20Chi.%20L.%20Rev.%20239\">\n    63 U.

That is quite different from the Supreme Court's recognition in\n   <em>\n    Diamond v. Charles\n   </em>\n   that someone supporting legislation for ideological reasons, without injury, lacks standing.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Op. at 1318.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-301\">\n   In sum, the implications of the majority's interpretation of Rule 23(a) make obvious its flawed reasoning, but in my view, its concept of a proper class, like its mootness analysis, also runs counter to constitutional standing doctrine. The Supreme Court has stated that \" Rule 23's requirements must be interpreted in keeping with Article III constraints.\"\n   <em>\n    Amchem Products, Inc. v.

Certification of a class consisting mostly of class members who plan to carry their pregnancies to term and who do not\n   <em>\n    claim\n   </em>\n   to be injured by the Government's policy violates Article III's requirement that a plaintiff suffer injury-in-fact.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-302\">\n   The majority concludes that it is irrelevant whether all members of the class claim an injury, relying primarily, by analogy, to the way the Supreme Court treats a case of joint plaintiffs. It is black letter law that once a federal court determines one of joint plaintiffs has standing, it is unnecessary to determine whether the others have standing.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Bowsher v.

But the analogy, in my view, doesn't hold because in the joint plaintiff case, it is irrelevant whether the \"others\" have standing - they are only interested in the resolution of the legal issue, like everyone else. In other words, they are not parties.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Planned Parenthood of Idaho, Inc. v.

To be sure, the Supreme Court once - because, as so often happens, it was anxious to reach the merits of an argument - sanctioned deciding an issue that had been waived,\n   <em>\n    U.S. Nat'l Bank of Or. v.

But since the Court set forth no standard - other than it be an anterior legal question - to guide the lower courts\n   as to when they should follow that practice, most courts ignore it. I try to - as did Judge Kavanaugh.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-312\">\n   The Government did make a somewhat different argument in our case not presented in the previous individual claims. It asserted, alternatively, that the district court's preliminary injunction, even assuming an injunction was proper, was much too broad. The majority responds by asserting that a narrower injunction would oblige the district court to make policy judgments so a blunderbuss rather than a rifle was necessary. The majority's apprehension seems rather ironic. After all, the whole body of constitutional jurisprudence relating to abortion is more driven by policy concerns than law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-313\">\n   Be that as it may, the majority's concerns seem overwrought. It discounts narrowing concepts such as giving limited time to the Government to find a sponsor because it would require the district judge to make \"policy\" decisions as to when the duty would start and when it would end. But it is our equitable obligation to fashion narrow relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-314\">\n   The Government's obligation to search for a sponsor should start the moment the pregnant minor says she wants an abortion. Although the Government may well have been seeking a sponsor before that time, and, as I noted earlier, that process can be lengthy, surely its efforts would be accelerated in light of the new information - or would be if my opinion were adopted. The Government's interest is to find a sponsor as quickly as possible in that situation. (We must assume the U.S. Government would be acting in good faith.) Of course, even if the Government is moving expeditiously, it could be unsuccessful for a period so there would have to be an end point. Using the analogy of the parental consent and judicial bypass cases, procedures that could cause up to a three-week delay have been recognized as expeditious.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Ohio v. Akron Ctr. for Reprod. Health\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6217149\" index=\"489\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/497/502/#p511\">\n    497 U.S. 502\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 514,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6217149\" index=\"490\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/497/502/#p511\">\n    110 S.Ct. 2972\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6217149\" index=\"491\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/497/502/#p511\">\n    111 L.Ed.2d 405\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1990). Of course, any injunction would have to include a recognition that the mother's health must be paramount and in no event could the process come close to viability. I would leave it to the district court to arrive at a figure that meets the Supreme Court's expeditious requirement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-315\">\n   The majority seems to find it irrational that the Government might treat minors differently than adults. Yet \"[t]he law does not always treat minors in the same way as adults, as the Supreme Court has repeatedly emphasized in the abortion context.\"\n   <em>\n    Garza\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12265713\" index=\"492\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/874/735/\">\n    874 F.3d at 755\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting). I agree with the Government that, even if the class were properly certified, the district court's injunction is far too broad because it ignores the Government's legitimate interest in the minor's welfare. The majority mistakenly analogizes the Government's policy articulated by counsel before us to a piece of legislation which would have to be accepted or rejected. Since we are presented with the Government's alternative argument regarding its policy that the injunction the district court adopted was too broad, as I noted, we have an equitable obligation to fashion the narrowest feasible injunction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State of Neb. Dep't of Health &amp; Human Servs. v. U.S. Dep't of Health &amp; Human Servs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3451649,936347\" index=\"493\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/435/326/\">\n    435 F.3d 326\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 330 (D.C. Cir. 2006). After all, \"[t]he need for narrow tailoring ... is particularly important in the context of a preliminary injunction or temporary restraining order, where the court has yet finally to resolve the merits of the dispute.\"\n   <em>\n    U.S. Ass'n of Reptile Keepers, Inc. v. Jewell\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4361512\" index=\"494\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/106/125/#p126\">\n    106 F. Supp. 3d 125\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 126 (D.D.C. 2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-316\">\n   The majority suggests that the Government's real interest in sponsorship is\n   nothing more than avoiding facilitation of abortion. This is unfair. It seems to me irrelevant as to what the \"record\" reveals of ORR's \"thinking\" - whatever that means - about the benefits of adult guidance for a pregnant minor. Contrary to the assertions of the majority, in this litigation, the Government has argued that sponsorship does provide that benefit to a pregnant minor.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Appellants' Br. 44 (\"Particularly in light of the benefits sponsorship provides, such a modest waiting period does not impose an undue burden on the minor's ability to pursue an abortion.\"). The majority seems to regard this case as if it were an APA challenge to agency action in which the express reasoning of the agency must be defended. But we are not reviewing administrative action, so we can rely upon the legal arguments made before us. And it is clear that the Government has invoked the benefits of sponsorship for the pregnant minors who are \"considering and pursuing such a personal and sensitive decision as abortion.\"\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-317\">\n   I am afraid the majority's refusal to consider narrowing the scope of the district court's order justifies Judge Kavanaugh's accusation that the court is endorsing abortion on demand - at least as far as the federal Government is concerned.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-320\">\n    The Ninth Circuit's statutory analysis was a terribly tempting target. Sometimes the Court is more driven by issues than procedural limitations.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-321\">\n    Resolution of this argument implicates the fourth requirement, numerosity. I am doubtful that a properly defined class could meet the numerosity requirement, which is likely why the Appellees defined the class in such broad terms. I think the majority's suggestion that even a smaller class might be appropriate is quite speculative.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    Op. at 1322-23.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-322\">\n    Like \"right to life.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-323\">\n    To be sure, the \"choice\" wording comes from the plurality opinion in\n    <em>\n     Casey\n    </em>\n    , but it seems to me that that strange wording itself had a political objective.
