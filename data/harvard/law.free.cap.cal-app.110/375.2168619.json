J.</author>\n<p id=\"A_c\">This is-an application for a writ of <em>supersedeas, </em>presented some time ago, asking for a stay of proceedings in the trial court in the case of <em>City of Los Angeles </em>v. <em>J. G. Oliver, Leonard J. Woodruff, </em>and others, then pending on appeal in this court and still pending here for certain purposes. Upon the presentation of the application a temporary <em>supersedeas </em>was ordered. Upon oral argument the order was not disturbed. On December 5, 1930, we filed our opinion disposing of the appeal, by it affirming the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">This conclusion having been reached by us, we think the temporary <em>supersedeas </em>should not stand for the few remaining days during which the cause in which the appeal was taken will be <em>sub judice </em>in this court for the purpose of passing upon a possible petition for rehearing. All points presented on the appeal having been determined adversely to petitioner, appellant on the appeal, the cause is in a very different situation from that it occupied when the temporary <em>supersedeas </em>was issued. We are satisfied that the appeal is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">The order for a temporary <em>supersedeas </em>is vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">Thompson (Ira F.), J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-9\">Craig, J., and Archbald, J., <em>pro </em>fern., were not present at the oral argument and did not participate in the foregoing decision.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
