He had judgment against both defendants and Sawano alone appeals on typewritten transcripts.</p>\n<p id=\"b647-11\">The due execution of the note is admitted, Sawano and the corporation being joint makers.

The appellant offered testimony of a number of witnesses tending to show that in January, 1926, the plaintiff delivered the note in suit to the corporation and took in lieu thereof two other notes executed by the corporation alone.

Its motion to restore the corporation as a defendant was granted over the objection of Sawano, but without objection from the corporation.
