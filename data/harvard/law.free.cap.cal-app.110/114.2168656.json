The size of each of the lots was approximately 42 by 133 feet. The \"action was predicated upon the asserted ground that the lot other than <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>the one upon which the dwelling of defendants was located could not properly be regarded as a part of the legal homestead of defendants for the reason that it was not used or occupied by them. Judgment was rendered in favor of defendants, and plaintiff appeals therefrom.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">On the trial of the action, among other things, the evidence included testimony given by one of the defendants to the effect that for \u201cat least ten years\u201d next preceding the date when the homestead was placed on the two lots, the so-called vacant lot in question had been used by defendants \u201cfor a chicken yard and garden\u201d, and that it had \u201cfruit trees on it\u201d, which consisted of an orange, a lemon, a walnut and a fig tree. Another witness testified that for \u201cseven years that I know of . . . Mrs. Lockwood has a chicken yard on the back end of it, and every summer, every year, she has a garden there; and in the summer when she is not working she cleans that yard up, cut down all the weeds and cleans it all up. And she has some fruit trees on it, and the trail from her house on that side is pretty well over in that lot.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">The cases of <em>Englebrecht </em>v. <em>Shade, </em>47 Cal. 627, <em>Arendt </em>v. <em>Mace, </em>76 Cal. 315 [9 Am. St. Rep. 207, 18 Pac. 376], <em>In re Allen, </em>2 Cal. Unrep. 835 [16 Pac. 319], and <em>Skinner </em>v. <em>Hall, </em>69 Cal. 195 [10 Pac. 406], are authorities which in principle clearly sustain the ruling of the trial court as to the sufficiency of the evidence herein upon which to rest the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">No other point being seriously presented by appellant, it is ordered that the judgment be and it is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">Conrey, P. J., and York, J., concurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">A petition for a rehearing of this cause was denied by the District Court of Appeal on December 16, 1930, and a petition by appellant to have the cause heard in the Supreme Court, after judgment in the District Court of Appeal, was denied by the Supreme Court on January 26, 1931.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
