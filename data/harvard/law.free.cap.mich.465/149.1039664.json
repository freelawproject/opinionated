The circuit court granted defendant\u2019s motion to quash and dismissed all charges against him on the basis <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>that it was legally impossible for him to have committed any of the charged crimes. We conclude that the concept of impossibility, which this Court has never adopted as a defense, is not relevant to a determination whether a defendant has committed attempt under MCL 750.92, and that the circuit court therefore erred in dismissing the charge of attempted distribution of obscene material to a minor on the basis of the doctrine of legal impossibility. We additionally conclude that, although the Court of Appeals erred to the extent that it relied upon the concept of \u201cimpossibility\u201d in dismissing the charge of solicitation of third-degree criminal sexual conduct, the charge was nevertheless properly dismissed because there is no evidence that defendant solicited any person to <em>\u201ccommit a felony\u201d </em>or to \u201cdo or omit to do an act which if completed would <em>constitute a felony\u201d </em>as proscribed by MCL 750.157b. Accordingly, we reverse in part and affirm in part the decision of the Court of Appeals and remand this matter to the circuit court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-5\">I. FACTUAL<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b422-6\">Deputy William Liczbinski was assigned by the Wayne County Sheriffs Department to conduct an undercover investigation for the department\u2019s Internet Crimes Bureau. Liczbinski was instructed to pose as a minor and log onto \u201cchat rooms\u201d on the Internet for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>the purpose of identifying persons using the Internet as a means for engaging in criminal activity.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-5\">On December 8, 1998, while using the screen name \u201cBekka,\u201d Liczbinski was approached by defendant, who was using the screen name \u201cMr. Auto-Mag,\u201d in an Internet chat room. Defendant described himself as a twenty-three-year-old male from Warren, and Bekka described herself as a fourteen-year-old female from Detroit. Bekka indicated that her name was Becky Fellins, and defendant revealed that his name was Chris Thousand. During this initial conversation, defendant sent Bekka, via the Internet, a photograph of his face.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-6\">From December 9 through 16, 1998, Liczbinski, still using the screen name \u201cBekka,\u201d engaged in chat room conversation with defendant. During these exchanges, the conversation became sexually explicit. Defendant made repeated lewd invitations to Bekka to engage in various sexual acts, despite various indications of her young age.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b423-7\">During one of his online conversations with Bekka, after asking her whether anyone was \u201caround there,\u201d watching her, defendant indicated that he was sending her a picture of himself. Within seconds, Liczbinski received over the Internet a photograph of male genitalia. Defendant asked Bekka whether she liked and wanted it and whether she was getting \u201chot\u201d yet, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>and described in a graphic manner the type of sexual acts he wished to perform with her. Defendant invited Bekka to come see him at his house for the purpose of engaging in sexual activity. Bekka replied that she wanted to do so, and defendant cautioned her that they had to be careful, because he could \u201cgo to jail.\u201d Defendant asked whether Bekka looked \u201cover sixteen,\u201d so that if his roommates were home he could lie.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">The two then planned to meet at an area McDonald\u2019s restaurant at 5:00 P.M. on the following Thursday. Defendant indicated that they could go to his house, and that he would tell his brother that Bekka was seventeen. Defendant instructed Bekka to wear a \u201cnice sexy skirt,\u201d something that he could \u201cget [his] head into.\u201d Defendant indicated that he would be dressed in black pants and shirt and a brown suede coat, and that he would be driving a green Duster. Bekka asked defendant to bring her a present, and indicated that she liked white teddy bears.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">On Thursday, December 17, 1998, Liczbinski and other deputy sheriffs were present at the specified McDonald\u2019s restaurant when they saw defendant inside a vehicle matching the description given to Bekka by defendant. Defendant, who was wearing a brown suede jacket and black pants, got out of the vehicle and entered the restaurant. Liczbinski recognized defendant\u2019s face from the photograph that had been sent to Bekka. Defendant looked around for approximately thirty seconds before leaving the restaurant. Defendant was then taken into custody. Two white teddy bears were recovered from defendant\u2019s vehicle. Defendant\u2019s computer was subsequently seized from his home. A search of the hard drive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>revealed electronic logs of Internet conversations matching those printed out by Liczbinski from the Wayne County-owned computer he had used in his Internet conversations with defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">Following a preliminary examination, defendant was bound over for trial on charges of solicitation to commit third-degree criminal sexual conduct, MCL 750.157b(3)(a) and 750.520d(l)(a), attempted distribution of obscene material to a minor, MCL 750.92 and 722.675, and child sexually abusive activity, MCL 750.145c(2).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">Defendant brought a motion to quash the information, arguing that, because the existence of a child victim was an element of each of the charged offenses, the evidence was legally insufficient to support the charges. The circuit court agreed and dismissed the case, holding that it was legally impossible for defendant to have committed the charged offenses. The Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal of the charges of solicitation and attempted distribution of obscene material to a minor, but reversed the dismissal of the charge of child sexually abusive activity.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> 241 Mich App 102 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"156\">*156</page-number>We granted the prosecution\u2019s application for leave to appeal.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 463 Mich 907 (2000).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">H. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">We must determine in this case whether the circuit court and the Court of Appeals properly applied the doctrine of \u201clegal impossibility\u201d in concluding that the charges against defendant of attempt and solicitation must be dismissed. The applicability of a legal doctrine is a question of law that is reviewed de novo. <em>James v Alberts, </em>464 Mich 12, 14; 626 NW2d 158 (2001). Similarly, the issue whether \u201cimpossibility\u201d is a cognizable defense under Michigan\u2019s attempt and solicitation statutes presents questions of statutory construction, which we review de novo. <em>People v Clark, </em>463 Mich 459, 463, n 9; 619 NW2d 538 (2000); <em>People v Morey, </em>461 Mich 325, 329; 603 NW2d 250 (1999).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">m. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">A. THE \u201cIMPOSSIBILITY\u201d DOCTRINE</p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">The doctrine of \u201cimpossibility\u201d as it has been discussed in the context of inchoate crimes represents the conceptual dilemma that arises when, because of the defendant\u2019s mistake of fact or law, his actions could not possibly have resulted in the commission of the substantive crime underlying an attempt charge. Classic illustrations of the concept of impossibility <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"157\">*157</page-number>include: (1) the defendant is prosecuted for attempted larceny after he tries to \u201cpick\u201d the victim\u2019s empty pocket<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>; (2) the defendant is prosecuted for attempted rape after he tries to have nonconsensual intercourse, but is unsuccessful because he is impotent<footnotemark>7</footnotemark>; (3) the defendant is prosecuted for attempting to receive stolen property where the property he received was not, in fact, stolen<footnotemark>8</footnotemark>; and (4) the defendant is prosecuted for attempting to hunt deer out of season after he shoots at a stuffed decoy deer.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In each of these examples, despite evidence of the defendant\u2019s criminal intent, he cannot be prosecuted for the <em>completed </em>offense of larceny, rape, receiving stolen property, or hunting deer out of season, because proof of at least one element of each offense cannot be derived from his objective actions. The question, then, becomes whether the defendant can be prosecuted for the <em>attempted </em>offense, and the answer is dependent upon whether he may raise the defense of \u201cimpossibility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b427-5\">Courts and legal scholars have drawn a distinction between two categories of impossibility: \u201cfactual impossibility\u201d and \u201clegal impossibility.\u201d It has been said that, at common law, legal impossibility is a defense to a charge of attempt, but factual impossibility is not. See American Law Institute, Model Penal Code and Commentaries (1985), comment to \u00a7 5.01, pp 307-317; Perkins &amp; Boyce, Criminal Law (3d ed), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"158\">*158</page-number>p 632; Dressier, Understanding Criminal Law (1st ed), \u00a7 27.07[B], p 349. However, courts and scholars alike have struggled unsuccessfully over the years to articulate an accurate rule for distinguishing between the categories of \u201cimpossibility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b428-6\">\u201cFactual impossibility,\u201d which has apparently never been recognized in any American jurisdiction as a defense to a charge of attempt,<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> \u201cexists when [the defendant\u2019s] intended end constitutes a crime but she fails to consummate it because of a factual circumstance unknown to her or beyond her control.\u201d Dressier, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 27.07[C][1], p 350. An example of a \u201cfactual impossibility\u201d scenario is where the defendant is prosecuted for attempted minder after pointing an unloaded gun at someone and pulling the trigger, where the defendant believed the gun was loaded.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b428-7\">The category of \u201clegal impossibility\u201d is further divided into two subcategories: \u201cpure\u201d legal impossibility and \u201chybrid\u201d legal impossibility. Although it is generally undisputed that \u201cpure\u201d legal impossibility will bar an attempt conviction, the concept of \u201chybrid legal impossibility\u201d has proven problematic. As Professor Dressier points out, the failure of courts to distinguish between \u201cpure\u201d and \u201chybrid\u201d legal impossibility has created confusion in this area of the law. Dressier, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 27.07[D][1], p 351.</p>\n<p id=\"b428-8\"><em>\u201cPure legal impossibility </em>exists if the criminal law does not prohibit <em>D\u2019s </em>conduct or the result that she has sought to achieve.\u201d <em>Id., </em>\u00a7 27.07[D][2], p 352 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"159\">*159</page-number>(emphasis in original). In other words, the concept of pure legal impossibility applies when an actor engages in conduct that he believes is criminal, but is not actually prohibited by law: \u201cThere can be no conviction of criminal attempt based upon d\u2019s erroneous notion that he was committing a crime.\u201d Perkins &amp; Boyce, <em>supra, </em>p 634. As an example, consider the case of a man who believes that the legal age of consent is sixteen years old, and who believes that a girl with whom he had consensual sexual intercourse is fifteen years old. If the law actually fixed the age of consent at fifteen, this man would not be guilty of attempted statutory rape, despite his mistaken belief that the law prohibited his conduct. See Dressier, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 27.07[D][2], pp 352-353, n 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-4\">When courts speak of \u201clegal impossibility,\u201d they are generally referring to what is more accurately described as \u201chybrid\u201d legal impossibility.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-5\">Most claims of legal impossibility are of the hybrid variety. <em>Hybrid legal impossibility </em>exists if d\u2019s goal was illegal, but commission of the offense was impossible due to a factual mistake by her regarding the legal status of some factor relevant to her conduct. This version of impossibility is a \u201chybrid\u201d because, as the definition implies and as is clarified immediately below, d\u2019s impossibility claim includes both a legal and a factual aspect to it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-6\">Courts have recognized a defense of legal impossibility or have stated that it would exist if D receives unstolen property believing it was stolen; tries to pick the pocket of a stone image of a human; offers a bribe to a \u201cjuror\u201d who is not a juror; tries to hunt deer out of season by shooting a stuffed animal; shoots a corpse believing that it is alive; or shoots at a tree stump believing that it is a human.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b429-7\">Notice that each of the mistakes in these cases affected the legal status of some aspect of the defendant\u2019s conduct. The status of property as \u201cstolen\u201d is necessary to commit <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"160\">*160</page-number>the crime of \u201creceiving stolen property with knowledge it is stolen\u201d\u2014i.e., a person legally is incapable of committing this offense if the property is not stolen. The status of a person as a \u201cjuror\u201d is legally necessary to commit the offense of bribing a juror. The status of a victim as a \u201chuman being\" (rather than as a corpse, tree stump, or statue) legally is necessary to commit the crime of murder or to \u201ctake and carry away the personal property <em>of another.\u201d </em>Finally, putting a bullet into a stuffed deer can never constitute the crime of hunting out of season.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-6\">On the other hand, in each example of hybrid legal impossibility <em>D </em>was mistaken about a fact: whether property was stolen, whether a person was a juror, whether the victims were human or whether the victim was an animal subject to being hunted out of season. [Dressier, <em>supra, </em>\u00a7 27.07[D][3][a], pp 353-354 (emphasis in original).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-8\">As the Court of Appeals panel in this case accurately noted, it is possible to view virtually any example of \u201chybrid legal impossibility\u201d as an example of \u201cfactual impossibility\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b430-9\"><em>\u201cUltimately any case of hybrid legal impossibility may reasonably be characterized as factual impossibility. . . . </em>[B]y skillful characterization, one can describe virtually any case of hybrid legal impossibility, which is a common law defense, as an example of factual impossibility, which is <em>not </em>a defense.\u201d [241 Mich App 106 (emphasis in original), quoting Dressier, Understanding Criminal Law (2d ed), \u00a7 27.07[D][3][a], pp 374-375.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b430-11\">See also Weiss, <em>Scope, mistake, and impossibility: The philosophy of language and problems of mens rea, </em>83 Colum L R 1029, 1029-1030 (1983) (\u201c[because ordinary English cannot adequately distinguish among the various kinds of impossible attempts, courts and commentators have frequently misclassified certain types of cases\u201d); <em>United States v Thomas, </em>13 CMA 278, 283; 32 CMR 278, 283 (1962) (\u201c[w]hat is abun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>dantly clear ... is that it is most difficult to classify any particular state of facts as positively coming within one of these categories to the exclusion of the other\u201d); <em>State v Moretti, </em>52 NJ 182, 189; 244 A2d 499 (1968) (\u201c[o]ur examination of [authorities discussing the doctrine of impossibility] convinces us that the application of the defense of impossibility is so fraught with intricacies and artificial distinctions that the defense has little value as an analytical method for reaching substantial justice\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b431-5\">It is notable that \u201cthe great majority of jurisdictions have now recognized that legal and factual impossibility are \u2018logically indistinguishable\u2019 . . . and have abolished impossibility as a defense.\u201d <em>United States v Hsu, </em>155 F3d 189, 199 (CA 3, 1998).<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> For example, several states have adopted statutory provisions similar to Model Penal Code, \u00a7 5.01(1),<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-6\">A person is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime if, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for commission of the crime, he:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-7\">(a) purposely engages in conduct which would constitute the crime if the attendant circumstances were as he believes them to be; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b431-8\">(b) when causing a particular result is an element of the crime, does or omits to do anything with the purpose of causing or with the belief that it will cause such result without further conduct on his part; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"162\">*162</page-number>(c) purposely does or omits to do anything which, under the circumstances as he believes them to be, is an act or omission constituting a substantial step in a course of conduct planned to culminate in his commission of the crime.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">In other jurisdictions, courts have considered the \u201cimpossibility\u201d defense under attempt statutes that did not include language explicitly abolishing the defense. Several of these courts have simply declined to participate in the sterile academic exercise of categorizing a particular set of facts as representing \u201cfactual\u201d or \u201clegal\u201d impossibility, and have instead examined solely the words of the applicable attempt statute. See <em>Darnell v State, </em>92 Nev 680; 558 P2d 624 (1976); <em>Moretti, supra </em>at 189; <em>People v Rojas, </em>55 Cal 2d 252; 358 P2d 921 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">B. ATTEMPTED DISTRIBUTION OF OBSCENE MATERIAL TO A MINOR</p>\n<p id=\"b432-7\">The Court of Appeals panel in this case, after examining Professor Dressler\u2019s exposition of the doctrine of impossibility, concluded that it was legally impossible for defendant to have committed the charged offense of attempted distribution of obscene material to a minor. The panel held that, because \u201cBekka\u201d was, in fact, an adult, an essential requirement of the underlying substantive offense was not met (dissemination to a minor), and therefore it was legally impossible for defendant to have committed the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-8\">We begin by noting that the concept of \u201cimpossibility,\u201d in either its \u201cfactual\u201d or \u201clegal\u201d variant, has never been recognized by this Court as a valid defense to a charge of attempt. In arguing that impossibility is a judicially recognized defense in Michigan, defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>relies heavily on our statement in <em>People v Tinskey, </em>394 Mich 108; 228 NW2d 782 (1975), that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-5\">[i]t is possible, <em>although we need not decide, </em>that defendants could not have been convicted of attempted abortion; at common law the general rule is that while factual impossibility is not a defense <em>(People v Jones, </em>46 Mich 441; 9 NW 486 [1881])[<footnotemark>14</footnotemark>], legal impossibility is a defense. LaFave &amp; Scott, Criminal Law, \u00a7 62, p 474. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">As is readily apparent, our statement in <em>Tinskey </em>regarding \u201clegal impossibility\u201d as a defense to an attempt charge is nothing more than obiter dictum. The defendants in <em>Tinskey </em>were not charged with attempt; rather, they were charged with statutory conspiracy. Moreover, we <em>specifically declined </em>in <em>Tinskey </em>to express any opinion regarding the viability of the \u201cimpossibility\u201d defense in the context of attempts. No other Michigan Supreme Court case has referenced, much less adopted, the impossibility defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">Finding no recognition of impossibility in our common law, we turn now to the terms of the statute. MCL 750.92 provides, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b433-8\">Any person who shall attempt to commit an offense prohibited by law, and in such attempt shall do any act towards the commission of such offense, but shall fail in the perpetration, or shall be intercepted or prevented in the execution of the same, when no express provision is made by law for the punishment of such attempt, shall be punished as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b434-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>3. If the offense so attempted to be committed is punishable by imprisonment in the state prison for a term less than 5 years, or imprisonment in the county jail or by fine, the offender convicted of such attempt shall be guilty of a misdemeanor ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b434-5\">Under our statute, then, an \u201cattempt\u201d consists of (1) an attempt to commit an offense prohibited by law, and (2) any act towards the commission of the intended offense. We have further explained the elements of attempt under our statute as including \u201can intent to do an act or to bring about certain consequences which would in law amount to a crime[<footnotemark>15</footnotemark>]; and ... an act in furtherance of that intent which, as it is most commonly put, goes beyond mere preparation.\u201d <em>People v Jones, </em>443 Mich 88, 100; 504 NW2d 158 (1993), quoting 2 LaFave &amp; Scott, Substantive Criminal Law, \u00a7 6.2, p 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-6\">In determining whether \u201cimpossibility,\u201d were we to recognize the doctrine, is a viable defense to a charge of attempt under MCL 750.92, our obligation is to examine the statute in an effort to discern and give effect to the legislative intent that may reasonably be inferred from the text of the statute itself. <em>People v McIntire, </em>461 Mich 147, 152-153; 599 NW2d 102 (1999). \u201cWhen a legislature has unambiguously conveyed its intent in a statute, the statute speaks for itself and there is no need for judicial construction; the proper role of a court is simply to <em>apply </em>the terms of the statute to the circumstances in a particular <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 153 (citation omitted). Accordingly, if our Legislature has indicated its intent to criminalize certain conduct despite the actor\u2019s mistake of fact, this Court does not have the authority to create and apply a substantive defense based upon the concept of \u201cimpossibility.\u201d See <em>People v Glass (After Remand), </em>464 Mich 266; 627 NW2d 261 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">We are unable to discern from the words of the attempt statute any legislative intent that the concept of \u201cimpossibility\u201d provide any impediment to charging a defendant with, or convicting him of, an attempted crime, notwithstanding any factual mistake\u2014regarding either the attendant circumstances or the legal status of some factor relevant thereto\u2014that he may harbor. The attempt statute carves out no exception for those who, possessing the requisite criminal intent to commit an offense prohibited by law and taking action toward the commission of that offense, have acted under an extrinsic misconception.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">Defendant in this case is not charged with the substantive crime of distributing obscene material to a minor in violation of MCL 722.675.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> It is unquestioned that defendant could not be convicted of that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>crime, because defendant allegedly distributed obscene material not to \u201ca minor,\u201d but to an adult man. Instead, defendant is charged with the distinct offense of attempt, which requires only that the prosecution prove intention to commit an offense prohibited by law, coupled with conduct toward the commission of that offense. The notion that it would be \u201cimpossible\u201d for the defendant to have committed the <em>completed </em>offense is simply irrelevant to the analysis. Rather, in deciding guilt on a charge of attempt, the trier of fact must examine the unique circumstances of the particular case and determine whether the prosecution has proven that the defendant possessed the requisite specific intent and that he engaged in some act \u201ctowards the commission\u201d of the intended offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">Because the nonexistence of a minor victim does not give rise to a viable defense to the attempt charge in this case, the circuit court erred in dismissing this charge on the basis of \u201clegal impossibility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">C. SOLICITATION TO COMMIT THIRD-DEGREE CRIMINAL SEXUAL CONDUCT</p>\n<p id=\"b436-7\">1. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b436-8\">Defendant was additionally charged, on the basis of his Internet conversations with \u201cBekka,\u201d with solicita<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>tion to commit third-degree criminal sexual conduct. Defendant maintains that it was \u201clegally impossible\u201d for him to have committed this crime, because the underlying felony requires the existence of a child under the age of sixteen.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> The Court of Appeals panel agreed, concluding that it was legally impossible for defendant to have committed the crime because the underlying form of third-degree criminal sexual conduct charged, MCL 750.520d(l)(a), required the existence of a person under the age of sixteen. The panel further concluded that it was legally impossible for defendant to have committed the crime for the additional reason that he did not \u201csolicit^ another person to commit a felony\u201d as proscribed by the solicitation statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">Our solicitation statute, MCL 750.157b, provides as follows, in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-6\">(1) For purposes of this section, \u201csolicit\u201d means to offer to give, promise to give, or give any money, services, or anything of value, or to forgive or promise to forgive a debt or obligation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-7\">(3) . . . [A] person who solicits <em>another person to commit a felony, </em>or who solicits <em>another person to do or omit to do an act which if completed would constitute a felony, </em>is punishable as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b437-8\">(a) If the offense solicited is a felony punishable by imprisonment for life, or for 5 years or more, the person is guilty of a felony .... [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b438-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number>The Court of Appeals erred to the extent that it relied on the doctrine of \u201cimpossibility\u201d as a ground for affirming the circuit court\u2019s dismissal of the solicitation charge. As we have explained, Michigan has never adopted the doctrine of impossibility as a defense in its traditional <em>attempt </em>context, much less in the context of <em>solicitation </em>crimes. Moreover, we are unable to locate any authority, and defendant has provided none, for the proposition that \u201cimpossibility\u201d is a recognized defense to a charge of solicitation in other jurisdictions.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">Nevertheless, the solicitation charge was properly dismissed for the reason that there is no evidence that defendant in our case solicited anyone \u201cto commit a felony\u201d or \u201cto do or omit to do an act which if completed would constitute a felony\u201d as prohibited by MCL 750.157b. Pursuant to the plain statutory language, the prosecution was required to present evidence that defendant requested that <em>another person </em>perform a criminal act. The evidence here shows only that defendant requested that \u201cBekka\u201d engage in sexual acts with him. While the requested acts might well have constituted a crime on defendant\u2019s part, \u201cBekka\u201d (or Liczbinski) would not have committed third-degree criminal sexual conduct had she (or he) done <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>as defendant suggested. As the Court of Appeals properly concluded:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-5\">What is lacking here is defendant\u2019s request to another person to commit a crime. \u201cBekka,\u201d the fourteen-year-old online persona of Deputy Liczbinski, was not asked to commit a crime. That is, while it would be a crime for defendant to engage in sexual intercourse with a fourteen-year-old girl, a fourteen-year-old girl is not committing a criminal offense (or at least not csc-m) by engaging in sexual intercourse with an adult. Thus, whether we look at this case as defendant asking fourteen-year-old \u201cBekka\u201d to engage in sexual intercourse with him or as defendant asking Deputy Liczbinski to engage in sexual intercourse with him, he did not ask another person to commit csc-m. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b439-6\">For the above reasons we conclude that the trial court properly dismissed the charge of solicitation to commit criminal sexual conduct. [241 Mich App 111.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">Accordingly, while the concept of \u201cimpossibility\u201d has no role in the analysis of this issue, we agree with the panel\u2019s conclusion that an element of the statutory offense is missing and that the solicitation charge was therefore properly dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">2. RESPONSE TO THE DISSENT</p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">In his partial dissent, Justice Taylor opines that our construction of MCL 750.157b(3) renders the second phrase of that subsection a \u201cnullity,\u201d and that this phrase\u2014\u201cor who solicits another person to do or omit to do an act which if completed would constitute a felony\u201d\u2014should be read to encompass \u201csituations where the solicitee could not be charged with the felony, but the solicitor could be.\u201d <em>Post </em>at 181. We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>We first note that, pursuant to the plain language of this phrase, it is the act of <em>\u201canother </em>person\u201d that must, if completed, \u201cconstitute a felony.\u201d We believe that the plain language of the statute does not support the interpretation our dissenting colleague gives it.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">Moreover, our construction of \u00a7 157b(3) does not render the second phrase of that subsection \u201cnugatory\u201d or \u201csurplusage.\u201d Rather, it appears that the Legislature, by its use of the phrase \u201cdo or omit to do an act which if completed would constitute a felony,\u201d intended to make clear that the solicited offense does not have to be completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">It is noteworthy that \u00a7 157b was substantially amended in 1986, following this Court\u2019s holding in <em>People v Rehkopf, </em>422 Mich 198; 370 NW2d 296 (1985). In <em>Rehkopf, </em>this Court examined two cases in which the defendants were charged under the former version of \u00a7 157b. Defendant Rehkopf had asked an undercover police officer to kill her husband, and defendant Snyder had asked someone to kill his brother. In neither case did the intended murder ever occur. This Court held that the statute was not violated where the defendants\u2019 conduct did not lead to the results the defendants urged\u2014namely, the deaths of Rehkopf\u2019s husband or Snyder\u2019s brother.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">In 1985, the statute read as follows, in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b440-8\">Any person who incites, induces or exhorts any other person to ... do any act which would constitute a felony . . . shall be punished in the same manner as if he had committed the offense incited, induced or exhorted.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">The <em>Rehkopf </em>majority held that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b441-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>\u00a7 157b does not subject a person to criminal responsibility for utterances that do not result in the commission of the offense sought to be committed. A person who does no more than utter words seeking the commission of an offense is subject to liability only for the common-law offense of solicitation. <em>[Id. </em>at 205.][<footnotemark>19</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">Justice Boyle and Chief Justice Williams dissented, opining that \u00a7 157b contained no requirement \u201cthat the solicitation result in either actual incitement or completion of the solicited offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 223.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">In 1986, the Legislature rewrote \u00a7 157b. The first clause of current subsection 157b(3) (\u201ca person who solicits another person to commit a felony\u201d), apart from using the term \u201csolicits,\u201d is quite similar to the phrase \u201c[a]ny person who incites, induces or exhorts any other person to do any act which would constitute a felony\u201d as used in the prior version of \u00a7 157b. However, the Legislature apparently deemed it necessary\u2014reasonably so, in light of the <em>Rehkopf </em>Court\u2019s construction of \u00a7 157b\u2014to clarify that the solicited act need not be completed in order to satisfy the elements of the statute. Accordingly, the second clause of subsection 157b(3) provides further that the statute is violated where the defendant \u201csolicits another person to do or omit to do an act which <em>if completed </em>would constitute a felony\u201d (emphasis supplied). It is quite probable that the Legislature believed that the phrase \u201csolicits another person to commit a felony\u201d would not have reached solicitations in which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number>solicited act never came to fruition, and that the second clause was added for this purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-5\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b442-6\">This Court has never recognized the doctrine of impossibility. Moreover, we are unable to discern any legislative intent that the doctrine may be advanced as a defense to a charge of attempt under MCL 750.92. Accordingly, the circuit court erred in dismissing this charge on the basis that it was \u201clegally impossible\u201d for defendant to have committed the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b442-7\">Furthermore, although we do not agree with the circuit court or the Court of Appeals that \u201clegal impossibility\u201d was properly invoked by defendant as a defense to the charge of solicitation, we nevertheless affirm the dismissal of this charge. There is no evidence that defendant solicited anyone \u201cto commit a felony\u201d or \u201cto do or omit to do an act which if completed would constitute a felony.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b442-8\">Accordingly, we reverse in part, affirm in part, and remand this matter to the circuit court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.

Bekka mentioned that her birthday was in 1984 and that she was in ninth grade, and defendant asked when she would be fifteen.

MCL 750.92, 722.675.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-5\">- I would also find that legal impossibility, while a viable defense to solicitation, is inapplicable to the charge of solicitation to commit third-degree criminal sexual conduct in this case. MCL 750.157b(3)(a), 750.520d(l)(a). I agree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that there is no evidence that defendant solicited anyone to commit csc-m. Therefore, I would affirm the Court of Appeals decision affirming the circuit court\u2019s dismissal of the solicitation charge, but on different grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-6\">I. \u201cLEGAL IMPOSSIBILITY\u201d IN MICHIGAN</p>\n<p id=\"b443-7\">The majority errs in concluding that \u201clegal impossibility\u201d has never been adopted in Michigan. It focuses on language in Tinskey<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> pertaining to \u201clegal impossibility\u201d as a defense to attempt, but ignores the reasoning of the decision. Viewing the forest as well as the trees, one observes that the reasoning and the conclusion of the <em>Tinskey </em>Court prove that it accepted the doctrine of \u201clegal impossibility.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b443-8\"><em>Tinskey </em>held that the defendants could not be guilty of conspiracy to commit abortion because the woman who was to be aborted was not pregnant. <em>Tinskey, supra </em>at 109. The Court reasoned that the Legislature, in enacting the statute, purposely required that conspiracy to abort involve a pregnant woman. It thereby rejected prosecutions where the woman was not pregnant. It concluded that the defen<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"174\">*174</page-number>dants in <em>Tinskey </em>could not be prosecuted for conspiracy to commit abortion because one of the elements of the crime, a pregnant woman, could not be established.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">Significantly, the <em>Tinskey </em>Court stated that \u201c[t]he Legislature has not, as to most other offenses, so similarly indicated that impossibility is not a defense.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>By this language, <em>Tinskey </em>expressly recognized the existence of the \u201clegal impossibility\u201d defense in the common law of this state. Even though the reference to \u201clegal impossibility\u201d regarding the crime of attempt may be dictum, the later statement regarding the \u201cimpossibility\u201d defense was part of the reasoning and conclusion in <em>Tinskey. </em>This Court recognized the defense, even if it did not do so expressly concerning charges for attempt or solicitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">Moreover, Michigan common law<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> is not limited to decisions from this Court. The majority should not ignore decisions from the Court of Appeals. That Court has accepted \u201clegal impossibility\u201d as a defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">For example, in <em>People v Ng, </em>the Court of Appeals distinguished between \u201cfactual impossibility\u201d and \u201clegal impossibility\u201d in rejecting a defendant\u2019s argument that he was not guilty of attempted murder. 156 Mich App 779, 786; 402 NW2d 500 (1986). It found <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>that factual impossibility is not a defense to a charge of attempted murder, but observed that legal impossibility <em>is </em>a defense, citing <em>Tinskey. </em>Similarly, in <em>People v Cain, </em>the court distinguished between \u201clegal impossibility\u201d and a defense based on a claim of right. 238 Mich App 95, 117-119; 605 NW2d 28 (1999). It implicitly read <em>Tinskey </em>as acknowledging the existence of the \u201clegal impossibility\u201d defense.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, in this case, the Court of Appeals correctly considered \u201clegal impossibility\u201d a viable defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\">H. INTERPRETATION OF THE ATTEMPT STATUTE</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">Even if \u201clegal impossibility\u201d were not part of Michigan\u2019s common law, I would disagree with the majority\u2019s interpretation of the attempt statute. It does not follow from the fact that the statute does not expressly incorporate the concept of impossibility that the defense is inapplicable.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">Examination of the language of the attempt statute leads to a reasonable inference that the Legislature did not intend to punish conduct that a mistake of legal fact renders unprohibited. The attempt statute makes illegal an \u201c. . . attempt to <em>commit an offense prohibited by law </em>. . . .\u201d MCL 750.92 (emphasis added). It does not make illegal an action not prohibited by law. Hence, one may conclude, the impossibility of completing the underlying crime can provide a defense to attempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>This reasoning is supported by the fact that the attempt statute codified the common-law rule regarding the elements of attempt. See <em>People v Youngs, </em>122 Mich 292, 293; 81 NW 114 (1899); <em>People v Webb, </em>127 Mich 29, 31-32; 86 NW 406 (1901). At common law, \u201clegal impossibility\u201d is a defense to attempt. <em>United States v Hsu, </em>155 F3d 189, 199-200 (CA 3, 1998); Dressier, Understanding Criminal Law (2d ed), \u00a7 27.07[B], p 369; 21 Am Jur 2d, Criminal Law, \u00a7 178, p 254. Absent a statute expressly abrogating \u201clegal impossibility,\u201d this common-law rule continues to provide a viable defense. <em>Bandfield v Bandfield, </em>117 Mich 80, 82; 75 NW 287 (1898), rev\u2019d in part on other grounds <em>Hosko v Hosko, </em>385 Mich 39; 187 NW2d 236 (1971).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">This state\u2019s attempt statute, unlike the Model Penal Code and various state statutes that follow it, does not contain language allowing for consideration of a defendant\u2019s beliefs regarding \u201cattendant circumstances.\u201d Rather, it takes an \u201cobjective\u201d view of criminality, focusing on whether the defendant actually came close to completing the prohibited act. 1 Robinson, Criminal Law Defenses, \u00a7 85(a), pp 423-424; \u00a7 85(b), p 426, n 22. The impossibility of completing the offense is relevant to this objective approach because impossibility obviates the state\u2019s \u201cconcern that the actor may cause or come close to causing the harm or evil that the offense seeks to prevent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 424.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>The majority\u2019s conclusion, that it is irrelevant whether it would be impossible to have committed the completed offense, contradicts the language used in the attempt statute. If an element of the offense cannot be established, an accused cannot be found guilty of the prohibited act. The underlying offense in this case, disseminating or exhibiting sexual material to a minor, requires a minor recipient. Because the dissemination was not to a minor, it is legally impossible for defendant to have committed the prohibited act.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-4\">This Court should affirm the Court of Appeals decision, determining that it was legally impossible for defendant to have committed the charged offense of attempted distribution of obscene material to a minor, MCL 750.92, 722.675.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">m. THE SOLICITATION STATUTE</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">I further disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that \u201clegal impossibility\u201d is not a recognized defense to a solicitation charge. As discussed above, the defense has been implicitly acknowledged in Michigan\u2019s case law. The majority states that no authority supports the proposition that \u201clegal impossibility\u201d is a defense to solicitation in other jurisdictions. However, this fact is unremarkable in light of the rarity with which the defense is invoked. Moreover, \u201cthe impossibility issue can arise in all inchoate offenses,\u201d including solicitation. Robinson, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 85(f)(2), p 436.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">The language of our solicitation statute demonstrates that an illegal solicitation must concern an act that would constitute a felony if completed. The stat<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>ute states, \u201ca person who solicits another person to commit a felony, or who solicits another person to do or omit to do an act which if completed would constitute a felony, is punishable as follows . . . MCL 750.157b(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">\u201cLegal impossibility\u201d would be a defense if the defendant\u2019s goal were illegal but the offense incomplete due to the defendant\u2019s factual mistake concerning the legal status of a relevant circumstance. See Dressier, <em>supra </em>at \u00a7 27.07[D][3][a], p 373 (discussing \u201chybrid legal impossibility\u201d). In this case, defendant was mistaken regarding the legal status of \u201cBekka,\u201d whom he believed to be a female minor but who was actually a male adult.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">However, defendant\u2019s factual mistake is irrelevant in analyzing the charge of solicitation to commit third-degree criminal sexual conduct. Even if he had made his request to engage in sexual intercourse to a fourteen-year-old girl, defendant, not the girl, would have violated the csc-m statute. Therefore, I agree with the majority that defendant did not solicit \u201cBekka\u201d to commit an act that constituted a felony within the meaning of the solicitation statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">I note that this is the same conclusion reached by the Court of Appeals. See 241 Mich App 102, 111; 614 NW2d 674 (2000). That Court erred, however, in applying a \u201clegal impossibility\u201d analysis. It was not defendant\u2019s mistake regarding the minority status of \u201cBekka\u201d that is significant. Rather, an element of the solicitation charge is missing. \u201cLegal impossibility\u201d is, therefore, irrelevant under the facts of this case. The solicitation charge was properly dismissed because the prosecution could not prove all elements of the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>iv. conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\">As judges, we often decide cases involving disturbing facts. However repugnant we personally find the criminal conduct charged, we must decide the issues on the basis of the law. I certainly do not wish to have child predators loose in society. However, I believe that neither the law nor society is served by allowing the end of removing them from society to excuse unjust means to accomplish it. In this case, defendant raised a legal impossibility argument that is supported by Michigan case law. The majority, in determining that legal impossibility is not a viable defense in this state, ignores that law.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">In keeping with precedent and legal authority, I would affirm the Court of Appeals decision that it was legally impossible for defendant to commit the charged offense of attempted distribution of obscene material to a minor. Of course, if this view prevailed, defendant could still be prosecuted for his alleged misconduct. He is to be tried on the most serious of the charges, child sexually abusive activity, MCL 750.145c.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">With regard to the solicitation charge, I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that \u201clegal impossibility\u201d is not a defense to solicitation. However, the defense does not apply under the facts of this case. Even if the facts had been as defendant believed, defendant did not solicit \u201cBekka\u201d to commit csc-m. Hence, an essential element of the solicitation charge is missing. The charge was properly dismissed for that reason, not because of the availability of the \u201clegal impossibility\u201d defense.</p>\n<judges id=\"b449-8\">Cavanagh, J., concurred with Kelly, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b443-9\"> <em>People v Tinskey, </em>394 Mich 108; 228 NW2d 782 (1975).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b444-8\"> I take this to mean that with respect to conspiracy to abort, as with most other statutory crimes, the Legislature has not indicated that impossibility is not a defense.

Thus, I concur with parts i, n, m(A), and m(B) of the majority opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">However, I respectfully dissent from the majority\u2019s analysis of the solicitation of third-degree criminal sexual conduct (csc-m) charge in part m(c). In my view, defendant may be charged with solicitation on the basis of the evidence that he solicited a person whom he believed to be a fourteen-year-old child to engage in an act of sexual penetration even though a child victim of such an act of csc-m would not be guilty of csc-m for \u201cvoluntarily\u201d engaging in the act.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">My difference with the majority is in its understanding of the solicitation statute, MCL 750.157b(3). That section provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b450-7\">[A] person who solicits another person to commit a felony, <em>or who solicits another person to do or omit to do an act which if completed would constitute a felony, </em>is punishable as follows: .... [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">As to the first clause (\u201ca person who solicits another person to commit a felony\u201d), I agree with the majority that defendant cannot be considered to have asked \u201cBekka\u201d to <em>commit </em>the felony of csc-m in violation of the solicitation statute because she cannot commit this felony by engaging in sex with an adult. If an adult and a child aged thirteen to fifteen engage in an act of \u201cconsensual\u201d sexual penetration, only the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number>adult would be committing the crime of csc-m.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thus, an adult who asks a fourteen-year-old child to engage in such an act cannot be considered to have asked the child to commit csc-m. That is, the solicitor has not breached the first clause in this section.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-5\">However, regarding the disjunctive clause that follows the first clause, i.e., \u201cor who solicits another person to do or omit to do an act which if completed would constitute a felony,\u201d this language is broader in scope than merely prohibiting a person from soliciting another person to commit a felony. I believe this language makes it unlawful to solicit another person to do an act that if the act were completed would be a felony. While this part of the statute surely is not as clear as it could be,<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> we must use statutory construction rules to give it meaning. A primary rule is that we should avoid making the second clause a nullity by giving it the same meaning as the first clause.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Using this tool, I conclude that the second clause means it is unlawful to solicit another person to join with the solicitor in doing an act that would constitute a fel<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>ony whether the solicited party could be guilty of the felony or not.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">This all means that the first clause requires that the solicited act would be a felony for which the solicitee could be charged. The second clause encompasses situations where the solicitee could not be charged with the felony, but the solicitor could be. This construction of the statute gives viability to both clauses of the section at issue and is, thus, in my view, not only preferable, but required.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">The gist of the majority opinion, with regard to the solicitation issue, is that the second phrase, i.e., \u201cor who solicits another person to do or omit to do an act which if completed would constitute a felony,\u201d is merely clarifying language to make clear that the Legislature did not intend to require that the solicitee actually complete the solicited felony in order for the solicitor to have violated the statute. That is, the majority states that the second clause was \u201cintended to make clear that the solicited offense does not have to be completed.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 170. Yet, the majority seems to acknowledge that the first clause is also violated by a solicitation to commit a felony even if the felony is never actually completed. This, then, makes the second clause a nullity. It is that outcome that disciplined readers of statutes should avoid.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">Also, the majority indicates that my interpretation is contrary to the plain language of the statute because \u201cit is the act of <em>\u2018another </em>person\u2019 that must, if completed, \u2018constitute a felony.\u2019 \u201d <em>Ante </em>at 170. I disagree because the majority\u2019s view on this point fails to give meaning to the words \u201cif completed.\u201d If, as the majority argues, the conduct of the solicitee in itself must constitute a felony, then the language of the sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>ond phrase has no different meaning than if it simply referred to \u201can act which . . . would constitute a felony.\u201d The reason is that, if the statutory language read \u201cor who solicits another person to do or omit to do an act which would constitute a felony,\u201d then it might well be argued that the solicited person\u2019s contemplated \u201cact,\u201d standing alone, must constitute a felony for the statute to be violated. However, the \u201cif completed\u201d language allows for the imposition of liability where completion of the solicited act by another person would necessarily constitute a felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">I agree with the majority that the current language of the solicitation statute, MCL 750.157b, seems to be in large measure a reaction to this Court\u2019s interpretation of the preceding statutory language at issue in <em>People v Rehkopf, </em>422 Mich 198; 370 NW2d 296 (1985). However, that means only that the Legislature intended to include circumstances in which the solicited felony is never actually committed within the scope of the solicitation statute. Indeed, the language of the first clause proscribing a person from merely asking another person \u201cto commit a felony\u201d suffices, by its plain and unambiguous meaning, to accomplish that goal. That does not mean, however, that the Legislature might not have wanted to cover more situations inasmuch as it was acting to broaden the scope of the statute. Accordingly, the discussion of <em>Rehkopf </em>does not alter my view that, in keeping with the canon of construction against rendering statutory language nugatory or surplusage, the second clause must be taken as encompassing more than the first clause, standing alone, does.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">Turning to the circumstances of the present case, there was evidence that defendant solicited \u201cBekka,\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"184\">*184</page-number>believing \u201cher\u201d to be a fourteen-year-old child, to engage in an act of sexual penetration with him. In other words, defendant solicited \u201cBekka\u201d to engage with him in an act of sexual penetration between an adult and a fourteen-year-old child. Thus, defendant solicited \u201cBekka\u201d to do an act that, \u201cif completed\u201d by the participation of defendant, would constitute the felony of csc-m on defendant\u2019s part. Accordingly, I conclude that such a solicitation falls within the range of conduct in the solicitation statute\u2019s prohibition of soliciting another person \u201cto do ... an act which if completed would constitute a felony.\u201d MCL 750.157b(3).</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">Of course, I recognize that because \u201cBekka\u201d was actually Deputy William Liczbinski, an adult, the solicited person could not actually have committed the act envisioned by defendant. However, that is immaterial. There is nothing in the language of the pertinent part of the solicitation statute, MCL 750.157b(3), that requires that it be possible for the solicited person to carry out the conduct that is solicited in order for the statute to be violated. Thus, consistent with the majority opinion\u2019s rejection of the \u201clegal impossibility\u201d defense, I conclude that it is immaterial that the deputy could not have carried out the solicited act.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">Accordingly, I agree with the majority\u2019s treatment of the attempted distribution of obscene material to a minor charge. However, I would also reverse the Court of Appeals with regard to the solicitation of csc-m charge, and would remand to the circuit court for trial on that charge.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b451-6\"> The csc-m statute provides, in pertinent part, that \u201c[a] person is guilty of [csc-iii] if the person engages in sexual penetration with another person and . . . [t]hat other person is at least 13 years of age and under 16 years of age.\u201d MCL 750.520d(l)(a). As one would expect, this language is phrased so as to impose criminal liability on an adult who engages in sexual penetration with a child aged thirteen to fifteen without imposing liability on the child victim of the crime.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b451-7\"> Perhaps the Legislature will want to consider revising the solicitation statute to employ more straightforward language in place of the phrase \u201cto do or omit to do an act which if completed would constitute a felony.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b451-8\"> \u201cIt is a maxim of statutory construction that every word of a statute should be read in a way as to be given meaning, and a court should avoid a construction that would render any part of the statute surplusage or nugatory.\u201d <em>In re MCI Telecommunications, </em>460 Mich 396, 414; 596 NW2d 164 (1999); see also <em>People v Warren, </em>462 Mich 415, 429, n 24; 615 NW2d 691 (2000) (no word of a statute should be treated as surplusage or rendered nugatory).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
