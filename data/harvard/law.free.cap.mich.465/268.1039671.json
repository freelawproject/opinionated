This undertaking is one where we, as our predecessor courts have done for over a quarter century, are interpreting and applying our own rules concerning guilty pleas. MCR 6.302(B)(3)(c) requires the trial court to inform the defendant that he waived his right at trial to be presumed innocent until proven guilty. Here, the trial court did not inform defendant of the presumption of innocence during the guilty plea hearing. However, earlier in the day defendant was present while the same judge instructed the jury that convened for defendant\u2019s trial\u2014on the charge to which he subsequently pleaded guilty\u2014that the defendant was presumed innocent until proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. In light of the <em>Guilty Plea Cases, </em>395 Mich 96; 235 NW2d 132 (1975), the question is whether there <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"271\">*271</page-number>was <em>substantial, </em>not strict, compliance with the requirements of MCR 6.302.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">Despite the trial court\u2019s omission of the presumption of innocence during the plea hearing, we hold that defendant \u201cwas informed of such constitutional rights and incidents of a trial as reasonable to warrant the conclusion that he understood what a trial is and that by pleading guilty he was knowingly and voluntarily giving up his right to a trial and such rights and incidents.\u201d <em>Guilty Plea Cases, supra </em>at 122. We reverse the Court of Appeals decision and reinstate defendant\u2019s plea of guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b541-7\">Jury selection for defendant\u2019s trial<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> began on the morning of April 13, 1998. In the afternoon of the first day of trial, after the first witness testified, the defendant decided to accept the prosecutor\u2019s plea bargain offer. Pursuant to that offer defendant pleaded guilty to one count of receiving and concealing stolen property, MCL 750.535, and to being a fourth felony offender, MCL 769.12. The trial judge engaged in a lengthy hearing with defendant on his guilty plea.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> However, during that hearing the trial judge did not inform defendant that by pleading guilty he was giving up the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> On July 17, 1998, defendant was sentenced as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>an habitual offender, fourth offense, to a prison term of twelve to forty years.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">On December 14, 1998, defendant moved to withdraw his plea on the ground that the trial court failed to inform him of the presumption of innocence. After a hearing on January 25, 1999, the trial court denied the motion. On March 28, 2000, the Court of Appeals issued a memorandum opinion<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> reversing the trial court\u2019s denial of defendant\u2019s motion to withdraw his guilty plea. The prosecution appealed to this Court, and we granted leave to appeal. 463 Mich 907 (2000).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">n</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">The procedures governing the acceptance of a guilty plea were first adopted by this Court in 1973<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> and are currently set forth in MCR 6.302. MCR 6.302(A) provides that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b542-7\">[t]he court may not accept a plea of guilty or nolo contendere unless it is convinced that the plea is understanding, voluntary, and accurate. Before accepting a plea of guilty or nolo contendere, the court must place the defendant under oath and personally carry out subrules (B)\u2014(E).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b542-8\">In <em>People v Shekoski, </em>393 Mich 134; 224 NW2d 656 (1974), this Court had held that \u201cstrict adherence to those requirements<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> is mandatory and that neither <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>substantial compliance nor the absence of prejudicial error will be deemed sufficient.\u201d However, one year later in <em>Guilty Plea Cases, supra, </em>this Court renounced the <em>Shekoski </em>holding that \u201cany failure of strict adherence to the procedure and practice specified in Rule 785.7 [now MCR 6.302] mandates reversal.\u201d <em>Guilty Plea Cases, supra </em>at 113. Instead, the Court adopted a doctrine of substantial compliance, holding that \u201c[w]hether a particular departure from Rule 785.7 justifies or requires reversal or remand for additional proceedings will depend on the nature of the noncompliance.\u201d <em>Guilty Plea Cases, supra </em>at 113. Thus, the question on appeal is whether it appears on the record that the defendant was informed of such constitutional rights and incidents of a trial as is reasonable to warrant the conclusion that he understood what a trial is and that by pleading guilty he was knowingly and voluntarily giving up his right to a trial and such rights and incidents. <em>Id. </em>at 113, 122.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">To determine if there was substantial compliance with the court rule, the first question is whether the right omitted or misstated is a <em>\u201cJaworski </em>right.\u201d In <em>People v Jaworski, </em>387 Mich 21; 194 NW2d 868 (1972), this Court held that a plea of guilty must be set aside where the record of the plea proceedings shows that the defendant was not advised of all three constitutional rights involved in a waiver of a guilty plea: 1) the right to trial by jury, 2) the right to confront one\u2019s accusers, and 3) the privilege against self-incrimination, relying on <em>Boykin v Alabama, </em>395 US 238; 89 S Ct 1709; 23 L Ed 2d 274 (1969). If a <em>Jaworski </em>right is omitted from the plea proceedings, then reversal is mandated. However, the omission from the plea proceedings of one or another of the rights attendant to a trial, other than a <em>Jaworski </em>right, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>or the imprecise recital of any such right, including a <em>Jaworski </em>right, does not necessarily require reversal. <em>Guilty Plea Cases, supra </em>at 122.</p>\n<p id=\"b544-6\">Here, the trial court failed to inform the defendant of the presumption of innocence. Informing defendant of his right to be presumed innocent is required under MCR 6.302(B)(3)(c),<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> but is not one of the three <em>Jaworski </em>rights. We note that in some cases the Court of Appeals has stated or assumed that the presumption of innocence had the same status as the three <em>Jaworski </em>rights\u2014that its omission mandates an automatic reversal. See <em>People v Russell, </em>73 Mich App 628, 629-630; 252 NW2d 533 (1977), and <em>People v Bender, </em>124 Mich App 571; 335 NW2d 85 (1983). In other cases, this Court and the Court of Appeals have reversed a guilty plea, without engaging in further analysis, when the trial court omitted the presumption of innocence. See <em>People v Lawrence, </em>413 Mich 866; 317 NW2d 856 (1982),<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> <em>People v Mitchell, </em>125 Mich App 475; 336 NW2d 31 (1983), and <em>People v </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number><em>Heintzelman, </em>142 Mich App 94; 368 NW2d 903 (1985).<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> To the extent that these cases held that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>omission of the presumption of innocence from guilty plea proceedings requires an automatic reversal of the guilty plea, we disapprove of them.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b546-6\">In <em>Guilty Plea </em>Cases, we did recognize that the presumption of innocence is \u201cat the core of our criminal process and fundamental to defendant\u2019s understanding of a trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 125. Nevertheless, the omission from a plea proceeding of a right attendant to trial, other than a <em>Jaworski </em>right, does not necessarily require reversal. <em>Id. </em>at 122. If from the record it appears that the defendant has been informed of his right to a trial and that this right is being waived by his plea of guilty, reversal is not required by the omission of any of the rights enumerated in the court rule, even the presumption of innocence. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b546-7\">Here, defendant was not informed of the presumption of innocence during the plea hearing. However, earlier in the day, while defendant was present, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>same judge had given the defendant\u2019s jury, which was empaneled on the same charge to which defendant pleaded guilty, a thorough explanation of the presumption of innocence,<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-5\">A person accused of a crime is presumed to be innocent. This means that you must start with the presumption that the defendant is innocent. This presumption continues throughout the trial, and entitles the defendant to a verdict of not guilty unless you find from the evidence beyond a reasonable doubt that he is.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-6\">Every crime is made up of parts called elements. The prosecutor must prove each element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-7\">The defendant is not required to prove his innocence or to do anything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-8\">Should you find that the prosecutor has not proven every element beyond a reasonable doubt, then you must find the defendant not guilty.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b547-9\">A reasonable doubt is defined as a fair, honest doubt growing out of the lack of evidence or the evidence in the case. It is, however, not an imaginary or a possible doubt. Instead, it is a doubt based upon reason, and common sense. It is a doubt which is considered reasonable after a careful and considered examination of all the facts and circumstances in the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b547-10\">Before defendant pleaded guilty, his trial on the charge to which he pleaded guilty had begun. Defendant had participated in having his constitutional rights to a trial by jury implemented, and specifically <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>had witnessed the jury being informed of the presumption of innocence to which he was entitled.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-5\">In <em>Guilty Plea Cases, supra </em>at 114-115, we approved cases where the trial judge did not personally address the defendant by informing him of the maximum sentence (Courtney) or the charge that the defendant was facing <em>(Bauer). </em>We concluded that the <em>prosecutor\u2019s </em>statement of that information in the presence of the defendants was sufficient. We stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-6\">These departures do not justify reversal. While it would be better for the judge to cover all the points himself, as long as he assumes the principal burden of imparting the required information, as did the judges in <em>Courtney </em>and <em>Bauer, </em>the purpose of requiring him personally to address the defendant and in so doing observe his demeanor and responses is achieved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b548-7\">A guilty plea conviction will not be reversed if the judge engages in the required colloquy but fails to mention an item which the record shows was established through, for example, an opening statement of or interjection by the prosecutor or defense counsel <em>in the hearing of the judge and defendant. </em>It is proper for the prosecutor or the clerk to read the information in the judge\u2019s presence. [Emphasis supplied.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b548-8\">Here, the trial judge addressed defendant with respect to eveiy right contained in the court rules save one. That failure was rectified by <em>the judge\u2019s </em>earlier statement, in defendant\u2019s presence, that informed the jury\u2014and defendant\u2014at length concerning the presumption of innocence. Thus, the judge clearly assumed \u201cthe principal burden of imparting the required information,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 114.</p>\n<p id=\"b548-9\">In <em>Courtney </em>and <em>Bauer, </em>this Court approved the practice of some of the required information being imparted by the prosecutor\u2014or, indeed, as we stated <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"279\">*279</page-number>later, by \u201can opening statement of or interjection by the prosecutor or defense counsel in the hearing of the judge and defendant.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 114-115. In such situations the reviewing court will rely on the defendant\u2019s <em>presence </em>when the information regarding the presumption of innocence is imparted to conclude that the defendant is aware of that information and that, therefore, his plea is knowing and understanding.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The clear import of our statements in <em>Guilty Plea Cases </em>is that observing the demeanor and responses of the defendant when advice regarding the \u201cbulk\u201d of the rights is imparted is sufficient to establish compliance with the \u201cpersonally address\u201d requirement.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b549-5\">In contrast to the situations already approved by us in the <em>Courtney </em>and <em>Bauer </em>cases, in this case it was the <em>judge </em>who imparted the additional information. Thus, we conclude that \u201cthe purpose of requiring [the judge] to personally address the defendant and in so doing observe his demeanor and responses [has been] achieved.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 114.</p>\n<p id=\"b549-6\">m</p>\n<p id=\"b549-7\">Apparently the dissent agrees with us on the legal principles involved. Both opinions recognize that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"280\">*280</page-number>defendant\u2019s plea must constitute a knowing and intelligent waiver of the defendant\u2019s rights. We also agree that reversal of defendant\u2019s conviction is not required if there is substantial compliance with the court rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b550-5\">The point of difference between the majority and the dissent is in the dissent\u2019s application of the concept of \u201csubstantial compliance.\u201d The majority abides by the interpretation of our rules set forth in <em>Guilty Plea Cases </em>that has held sway for over twenty-five years: there is substantial compliance with the \u201cpersonally address\u201d requirement if, even though the judge fails to recite a specific right at the guilty plea proceeding, the omission is rectified by recitation of the right in the defendant\u2019s presence at some other point during the in-court proceedings. The dissent apparently would require strict compliance with MCR 6.302(B)(3)(c), and mandate reversal whenever the defendant was not instructed on the presumption of innocence at the guilty plea hearing itself. In so doing, the dissent would sub silentio overrule <em>Guilty Plea Cases, </em>and return to the strict compliance rule of <em>People v Shekoski. </em>We believe that the crucial question is whether the defendant\u2019s plea was knowing and voluntary, not whether the trial court has engaged in a letter-perfect \u201ctalismanic chant.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Under the court rule, a failure to state one of the rights at the plea hearing does not require vacating the conviction where, as here, the court has directly addressed the defendant regarding the enumerated rights generally and the defendant has otherwise been informed adequately of the omitted right. The dissent has not identified any basis in the rule to support its contrary position. Thus, we decline the dissent\u2019s invitation to turn our <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"281\">*281</page-number>backs on established precedent and re-interpret \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d to require strict compliance at the time of the plea-taking.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-5\">Finally, the dissent suggests that the presumption of innocence has the same status as the three <em>Jaworski </em>rights\u2014that its omission mandates an automatic reversal. In <em>Jaworski </em>this Court held that in order for there to be a valid guilty plea, there must be an enumeration and a waiver on the record of the three federal constitutional rights as set forth in <em>Boykin v Alabama, </em>supra: the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination, the right to trial by jury, and the right to confront one\u2019s accusers. The United States Supreme Court has not held that the presumption of innocence is such a right. See <em>Johnson v Ohio, </em>419 US 924, 925; 95 S Ct 200; 42 L Ed 2d 158 (1974). Although we continue to recognize the importance of the presumption of innocence, we decline to elevate it to the status of the <em>Boykin/Jaworski </em>rights.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-6\">iv</p>\n<p id=\"b551-7\">On the basis of the whole record, including the beginning of the jury trial earlier that same day, we find that the trial judge\u2019s initial determination that the defendant knowingly and voluntarily gave up his right to a trial and all the attendant rights was correct.</p>\n<p id=\"b551-8\">We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals vacating defendant\u2019s guilty plea, and reinstate defendant\u2019s conviction and sentence.</p>\n<judges id=\"b551-9\">Corrigan, C.J., and Taylor and Young, JJ., concurred with Weaver, J.</judges>\n<p id=\"b551-10\">Young, J. I join in the majority opinion and fully concur that an omission <em>from the plea proceedings </em>of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"282\">*282</page-number>one or another of the rights attendant to trial, other than a <em>Jaworski </em>right, does not necessarily require reversal. However, I write separately because I wish to clarify that, in my view, there was no omission of the \u201cpresumption of innocence,\u201d and thus, no error under MCE 6.302(B)(3)(c) occurred in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b552-5\">The trial court, during the plea proceeding, advised defendant that he had a right to a trial by jury and that he had a right to have his guilt proven beyond a reasonable doubt. Specifically, the trial judge directly said the following to defendant:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-6\"><em>The Court: </em>You obviously know what a jury trial is. You\u2019ve been sitting here during jury selection, and you\u2019ve seen witnesses testify so you understand that you\u2019re here because you have the right to be here. Meaning you have the right to have this trial, and <em>you have the right to have the jury decide the facts, and decide whether or not your guilt is proven beyond a reasonable doubt. </em>And you\u2019ve seen cross-examination so you understand you have the right to see, hear and cross-examine the State\u2019s witnesses. Am I correct in inferring that? [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b552-7\"><em>The Court: </em>Do you understand that you give up those rights, and give up the right to a trial if you change your plea to guilty?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b552-8\">In my view, advising defendant that he had a right to have his guilt proven beyond a reasonable doubt necessarily encompassed the advice that he would have been presumed innocent. The presumption of innocence is \u201cnothing more than an amplification of the prosecution\u2019s burden of persuasion.\u201d See 2 McCormick, Evidence (5th ed), \u00a7 342, p 437. If the presumption of innocence adds anything, it is merely \u201ca warning not to treat certain things improperly as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"283\">*283</page-number>evidence.\u201d 9 Wigmore, Evidence (3d ed), \u00a7 2511, p 409.</p>\n<p id=\"b553-4\">The court did not recite literally the court rule terminology. However, when defendant was told that he had a right to have his guilt proven beyond a reasonable doubt, he necessarily learned that he would be considered innocent in the absence of such proof of his guilt. In my view, this advice adequately informed defendant of the \u201cpresumption of innocence.\u201d No single method of recital is required. <em>Guilty Plea Cases, </em>395 Mich 96, 119-120; 235 NW2d 132 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b553-5\">I believe that the phrase \u201cpresumption of innocence\u201d is merely a shorthand way of referring to the right to have a jury find a defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. Accordingly, I believe defendant was in fact informed of the \u201cpresumption of innocence\u201d and that no omission of advice as required by the rule occurred in this case.</p>\n<judges id=\"b553-6\">Corrigan, C.J., concurred with Young, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b541-8\"> Defendant was charged with five counts: 1) home invasion, second degree, MCL 750.110a(3), 2) home invasion, second degree, MCL 750.110a(3), 3) receiving and concealing weapons or firearms, MCL 750.535b, 4) receiving and concealing stolen property in excess of $100, MCL 750.535, and 5) receiving and concealing stolen property in excess of $100, MCL 750.535.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b541-9\"> The transcript for the hearing totals thirty-one pages.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b541-10\"> MCR 6.302(B)(3)(c).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b542-9\"> Unpublished memorandum opinion, issued March 28, 2000 (Docket No. 217802).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b542-11\"> In granting leave, we directed the parties to \u201cinclude discussion of whether the alleged error is subject to harmless error review and, if so, what is the appropriate harmless error standard in this case.\u201d Because we hold that the trial court substantially complied with the requirements for taking a plea, we do not reach the question of harmless error.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b542-12\"> 389 Mich lv-lvii.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b542-13\"> At that time, the requirements, which were substantially similar to those of MCR 6.302, were found in GCR 1963, 785.7.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b544-7\"> MCR 6.302(B)(3)(c) requires the court to advise the defendant and determine that the defendant understands that if his plea is accepted the defendant will not have a trial and gives up the rights he would have had at trial, including the right \u201cto be presumed innocent until proven guilty.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b544-8\"> The order in <em>Lawrence, </em>read, in its entirety:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b544-9\">On order of the Court, the defendant having filed a request for review of his conviction, this Court having issued an order to show cause why the defendant\u2019s conviction should not be reversed because he was not advised of the presumption of innocence as required by GCR 1963, 785.7(l)(g)(iii), and the prosecutor\u2019s response to that order having been considered by the Court, now, therefore, it is ordered that the request for review be treated as an application for leave to appeal and, pursuant to GCR 1963, 853.2(4), in lieu of granting leave to appeal, we reverse the defendant\u2019s convictions because he was not advised of the presumption of innocence.

We would note that in <em>Russell, supra, </em>the Court of Appeals <em>affirmed </em>the defendant\u2019s conviction despite the trial court\u2019s failure to \u201c[speak] the precise words \u2018presumed innocent.\u2019 \u201d 73 Mich App 631. In <em>People v Jackson, </em>71 Mich App 468; 248 NW2d 551 (1976), the Court of Appeals affirmed the defendant\u2019s conviction where, although he was not informed of his right to be presumed innocent at the guilty plea proceeding, he was informed of that right in a <em>prior </em>guilty plea entered the <em>preceding day </em>before the same judge. <em>Id. </em>at 469-470.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-6\">We futher note that the decision of the Court of Appeals in <em>People v Ingram, </em>166 Mich App 433; 424 NW2d 19 (1988), did not involve a failure to advise, but rather an imprecise recital of the right to be presumed innocent. The trial court stated that the defendant would be \u201cpresumed innocent of this offense until proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d The Court of Appeals affirmed the defendant\u2019s guilty plea, finding that \u201c[i]t appears on the record that defendant was sufficiently informed of his constitutional rights and the incidents of trial to warrant a conclusion that he understood what a trial is and that by tendering his plea he was knowingly and intelligently giving up his right to a trial and its consequent rights and protections.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 437-438.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-7\">In <em>Heintzelman, supra, Mitchell, supra, </em>and <em>People v Wilson, </em>78 Mich App 307; 259 NW2d 356 (1977), the Court of Appeals reversed the defendants\u2019 convictions where there was a <em>total absence </em>of advice concerning the presumption of innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b545-8\">Finally, in <em>Bender, supra, </em>the defendant pleaded guilty to an habitual offender charge after being tried and found guilty by a jury on the accompanying substantive offenses. The Court of Appeals observed that defendant was informed of a number of his rights through the statement of those rights by his counsel when the defendant expressed a desire to plead guilty to the habitual charge <em>while the jury was still deliberating on the substantive charges. </em>The Court of Appeals stated: \u201cAlthough defendant was not personally advised of a number of his rights by the trial court, defense counsel\u2019s on-the-record statement of some of defendant\u2019s rights satisfies the requirement that the trial court \u2018personally address\u2019 the defendant as to those rights. ... As long as defendant is orally informed in open court of his rights and the trial court can personally observe defendant\u2019s demeanor and responses, the purpose of the personally address requirement is achieved. . . . Nor is it fatal to the plea that defendant was informed of his rights before the jury returned a guilty verdict on the principal charge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 577 (citations omitted). Thus, the decision of the Court of Appeals in <em>Bender </em>supports this Court\u2019s analysis in the present case in determining that the recital of a right in open court at a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>time other than the actual plea proceeding is sufficient to satisfy the \u201cpersonally address\u201d requirement; the Court vacated the guilty plea only because there was a <em>total absence </em>of advice concerning the presumption of innocence. We note, of course, that under current practice, a defendant does not plead guilty to an habitual supplementation.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-9\">Therefore, while we agree with the dissent\u2019s view that \u201c[t]his line of precedent firmly establishes [that a complete failure] to advise [a] defendant of his right to be presumed innocent\u201d will continue to result in reversal of a defendant\u2019s guilty plea, we conclude that the above precedent does not stand for the ultimate proposition urged by the dissent: that advice concerning the presumption of innocence delivered at an in-court proceeding close in time to the guilty plea proceeding is insufficient compliance with the court rule. In our view, the above precedent fully supports our conclusion in this case that the advice imparted earlier in the case by the trial court was sufficient compliance with MCR 6.302(B).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b546-10\"> We continue to emphasize the point we made in <em>People v Williams, </em>386 Mich 277; 192 NW2d 466 (1971), and <em>Jaworski, supra, </em>that it is important for the trial court to make a full and complete record of protecting all the defendant\u2019s rights.

PURPOSE AND GOAL OF GUILTY PLEA HEARING</p>\n<p id=\"b554-5\">The primary purpose of MCR 6.302\u2019s mandate that the defendant be personally addressed with the required statements is grounded in the principle that the defendant\u2019s plea must constitute a \u201cknowing and intelligent\u201d waiver of his constitutional rights. <em>McCarthy v United </em>States, 394 US 459, 465; 89 S Ct 1166; 22 L Ed 2d 418 (1969). To that end, the rule: (1) provides the court accepting the guilty plea the opportunity to observe the defendant\u2019s demeanor and the manner in which he responds to the court\u2019s statements and questions; (2) impresses upon the defendant the full gravity and import of his plea, and that, in so pleading, he waives the right to a trial and all of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"285\">*285</page-number>Ms other related constitutional rights;<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> and (3) creates a record of factors relevant to ascertaiMng the voluntariness of defendant\u2019s plea.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>People v Napier, </em>69 Mich App 46, 48; 244 NW2d 359 (1976), see also <em>Guilty Plea Cases, </em>395 Mich 96, 122; 235 NW2d 132 (1975).</p>\n<p id=\"b555-4\">n. PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b555-5\">The principle of the presumption of innocence is an essential foundation of our adversarial system of crimmal justice. <em>In re Winship, </em>397 US 358, 363; 90 S Ct 1068; 25 L Ed 2d 368 (1970), see also <em>Coffin v United States, </em>156 US 432, 453; 15 S Ct 394; 39 L Ed 481 (1895). The presumption of innocence is \u201cthe undoubted law, axiomatic and elementary, and its enforcement lies at the foundation of the admimstration of our criminal law.\u201d <em>Coffin, supra </em>at 453.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> \u201cThe accused during a criminal prosecution has at stake <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"286\">*286</page-number>interest of immense importance, both because of the possibility that he may lose his liberty upon conviction and because of the certainty that he would be stigmatized by the conviction.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b556-6\">A guilty plea constitutes a waiver of the fundamental right to a jury trial. <em>Parke v Raley, </em>506 US 20, 29; 113 S Ct 517; 121 L Ed 2d 391 (1992). It is because of the waiver of these rights and because a guilty plea is itself effectively a self-imposed conviction, that the process \u201cdemands the utmost solicitude of which courts are capable in canvassing the matter with the accused to make sure he has a full understanding of what the plea connotes and of its consequence.\u201d <em>Boykin v Alabama, </em>395 US 238, 243-244; 89 S Ct 1709; 23 L Ed 2d 274 (1969). It is with this principle in mind that a court must review a guilty plea and determine whether the accused has been informed of all the rights that he is waiving.</p>\n<p id=\"b556-7\">m. MCR 6.302</p>\n<p id=\"b556-8\">MCR 6.302 states that the defendant is entitled during the guilty plea hearing to a <em>direct </em>and <em>explicit </em>statement from the court concerning the rights set <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"287\">*287</page-number>forth in the rule. It is expressly required that the court \u201cspeak[] directly to\u201d the defendant, and that the court \u201cmust advise\u201d the defendant and \u201cdetermine that the defendant understands\u201d that he has the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty. MCR 6.302.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-4\">Clearly, the omission in this case was more than merely an imprecise recital of the rights to which defendant was entitled and which he was surrendering by virtue of his plea. See <em>People v </em>Russell, 73 Mich App 628, 631; 252 NW2d 533 (1977), asserting that \u201c[t]he determinative question ... is whether the trial judge omitted advice on that subject or merely gave an imprecise recital.\u201d The flaw in procedure in the instant case was not that the wrong formulation or the wrong articulation of defendant\u2019s rights was provided, but rather that <em>no </em>formulation and <em>no </em>articulation were provided. As the majority recognizes, I agree that substantial compliance with MCR 6.302, with regard to the right to be presumed innocent, is all that is required. However, the question in the instant case is whether there was <em>any </em>compliance with the rule. I can only answer this in the negative because the statement required by the rule was not made, precisely or imprecisely, perfectly or imperfectly, at the guilty plea hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b557-5\">IV. analysis of the majority opinion</p>\n<p id=\"b557-6\">The majority cites the <em>Guilty Plea Cases, </em>395 Mich 96, 113; 235 NW2d 132 (1975), and states that \u201c[w]hether a particular departure from [the rule] justifies or requires reversal or remand for additional proceedings will depend on the nature of the noncompliance.\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 273. The majority then asserts that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"288\">*288</page-number>inquiry on appeal \u201cis whether it appears on the record that the defendant was informed of such constitutional rights and incidents of a trial as is reasonable to warrant the conclusion that he understood what a trial is and that by pleading guilty he was knowingly and voluntarily giving up his right to a trial and such rights and incidents.\u201d <em>Id., </em>citing <em>Guilty Plea Cases, supra </em>at 122. The actual rule itself appears to be little more than a bit actor in this process.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-6\">While it is true that the <em>Guilty Plea Cases </em>established that the determination whether MCR 6.302 was \u201csubstantially complied with\u201d was to be part of a case-by-case inquiry, this Court also made clear at the time that the rule requires that a defendant be advised of his right to be presumed innocent, because such right is \u201cat the core of our criminal process and fundamental to defendant\u2019s understanding of a trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 125. In <em>Guilty Plea Cases, </em>this Court reversed a conviction entered on a plea of guilty where the trial court had failed to inform the defendant, during the guilty plea hearing, of his right to be presumed innocent. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b558-7\">Further, this Court has had subsequent occasion to address whether a defendant must be advised of this right, and has concluded that a trial court\u2019s failure to advise the defendant, at the guilty plea hearing, that he has the right to be presumed innocent is error requiring reversal of the conviction. In <em>People v Allen, </em>396 Mich 829 (1976), the defendant was not advised of the presumption of innocence, and, as a result, had his conviction set aside. In <em>People v Lawrence, </em>413 Mich 866 (1982), there was an omission of any statement to the defendant that he had the right to be presumed innocent and, as a result, his conviction was reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"289\">*289</page-number>The Court of Appeals has also followed this established precedent. In <em>People v Ingram, </em>166 Mich App 433, 437-438; 424 NW2d 19 (1988), the Court of Appeals held that a defendant must be advised at the guilty plea hearing, however imprecisely, that he is relinquishing his right to be presumed innocent. In <em>People v Heintzelman, </em>142 Mich App 94, 95; 368 NW2d 903 (1985), the defendant\u2019s conviction was reversed where the trial court had failed to advise him of his right to be presumed innocent. In <em>People v Mitchell, </em>125 Mich App 475, 477; 336 NW2d 31 (1983), the Court of Appeals reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction where the trial court did not advise him of his right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty. In <em>People v Bender, </em>124 Mich App 571, 578; 335 NW2d 85 (1983), the Court of Appeals held that \u201c[t]he right to be presumed innocent is of preeminent importance and, therefore, a defendant must be informed of this right on the record or his plea is constitutionally defective.\u201d The Court proceeded to reverse the defendant\u2019s conviction where the record did not disclose that he was \u201cpersonally informed, precisely or imprecisely, of his right to be presumed innocent.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In <em>People v Wilson, </em>78 Mich App 307, 308; 259 NW2d 356 (1977), the Court of Appeals reversed the defendant\u2019s conviction where the record did not establish that the trial court had advised him of his right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-4\">This line of precedent firmly establishes that, where a trial court has completely failed to advise the defendant of his right to be presumed innocent at the guilty plea hearing, the defendant is entitled to a reversal of his conviction, and either to replead or proceed to trial. In this case, defendant was not in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"290\">*290</page-number>formed, in any manner, of his right to be \u201cpresumed innocent until proved guilty.\u201d MCR 6.302(B)(3)(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">A waiver of the constitutional right set forth by the rule is supposed to be \u201can <em>intentional </em>relinquishment or abandonment of a <em>known </em>right or privilege.\u201d <em>Johnson v Zerbst, </em>304 US 458, 464; 58 S Ct 1019; 82 L Ed 1461 (1938) (emphasis added); see also <em>People v Siebert, </em>450 Mich 500, 510; 537 NW2d 891 (1995). In this case, it is impossible to conclude that defendant made an <em>intentional </em>relinquishment of his right at trial to be presumed innocent. <em>People v Scott, </em>381 Mich 143, 147-148; 160 NW2d 878 (1968). This is simply because defendant was never informed at all of this right. Obviously, it could not be determined that he understood that this right was being \u201cforever relinquished\u201d with respect to the charges to which he pleaded guilty. Given the circuit court\u2019s omission in this case, we cannot conceivably determine whether the purpose of MCR 6.302 was fulfilled, i.e., whether the defendant\u2019s pleas constituted a \u201cknowing and voluntary\u201d waiver of his constitutional rights.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">I am unpersuaded by the argument of the majority that, while this Court has previously stated that a failure to advise the defendant of his right to be presumed innocent at the guilty plea hearing is error requiring reversal, it is not error if the omitted statements concerning the presumption of innocence were made <em>at some point </em>during the criminal justice pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"291\">*291</page-number>cess, although not, as expressly required, at the guilty plea hearing itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">The majority observes, in this regard, that \u201cearlier in the day defendant was present while the same judge instructed the jury that convened for defendant\u2019s trial\u2014on the charge to which he subsequently pleaded guilty\u2014that the defendant was presumed innocent until proven guilty . . . .\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 270. The majority accords greater weight to this happenstance than to the fact that the judge failed to comply with its obligation that it \u201cmust . . . personally\u201d advise defendant of his constitutional rights, and that it must do so <em>at </em>the guilty plea hearing. The majority opinion continues in this regard:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-5\">In light of the <em>Guilty Plea Cases, </em>395 Mich 96; 235 NW2d 132 (1975), the question is whether there was <em>substantial, </em>not strict, compliance with the requirements of MCR 6.302.[<footnotemark>6</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-6\">Despite the trial court\u2019s omission of the presumption of innocence during the plea hearing, we hold that defendant \u201cwas informed of such constitutional rights and incidents of a trial as reasonable to warrant the conclusion that he understood what a trial is and that by pleading guilty he was knowingly and voluntarily giving up his right to a trial and such rights and incidents.\u201d <em>[Ante </em>at 270-271, quoting <em>Guilty Plea Cases, supra </em>at 122.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"292\">*292</page-number>One could hardly imagine a trial proceeding where the <em>jury </em>has not been informed that the defendant has a right to enjoy the presumption of innocence. Is it the majority\u2019s new rule that where, as might commonly occur, a guilty plea is taken after a defendant has decided to abort a trial, the court need not comply with those aspects of MCR 6.302 that were touched upon in any manner during such trial? Does such a partial trial effectively nullify the requirement that a pleading defendant be apprised of his presumption of innocence? Is the explicit requirement of the rule that the trial court \u201cspeak directly\u201d to the defendant satisfied where the court instead \u201cspeak[s] directly\u201d to the jury? Is the explicit requirement of the rule that the trial court advise the defendant of his rights during the guilty plea hearing satisfied when the defendant overhears these words in the court\u2019s statement to the jury? Is the purpose of the rule, that the defendant be advised of his rights when he is most focused upon the implications of his nearly irrevocable decision to convict himself by a guilty plea, fulfilled where he overhears these rights in a context far removed from this moment of irrevocability?<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">To all of these questions, I answer that it is the defendant, not the members of the jury, who must ultimately consider the gravity of an admission of guilt. And it is unwarranted to equate, as the majority does here, the defendant\u2019s <em>possible </em>awareness of these rights when they were brought to the attention of the jury with the defendant himself being personally advised of these rights at the guilty plea hearing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>after he has chosen to acknowledge the crime for which he has been charged.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> It is not during the jury trial that the defendant has made the momentous decision to admit guilt, and, thus, it is not at that juncture that he must be impressed with the import of his decision to plead guilty and be apprised of the consequences of his decision. Indeed, as this Court stated in the <em>Guilty Plea Cases:</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-4\">That a defendant may have been tried by a jury in another case or learned of his rights in an earlier plea-taking proceeding would no more negate his right to be informed of the right to and incidents of a trial <em>at the time a plea of guilty is offered </em>than would proof that he had seen Perry Mason on television or read Erie Stanley Gardner.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b563-5\">Many defendants have been made aware at one time or another of the right to and incidents of a trial and the consequences of a plea of guilty. Nevertheless, <em>whatever the personal history of the accused and the quality of his representation, </em>the appearance of justice and the integrity of the process by which pleas of guilty are offered and accepted require, <em>in the solemn moment of passage from presumed innocence to conviction and potential imprisonment, </em>that the judge apprise every defendant of the rights he is waiving and the consequences of his plea and make the other determinations required by the rule. <em>However, a recital of rights to one defendant by one judge on one day, </em>may suffice as a recital of rights to that same defendant by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>the same judge on that same day in another case. <em>[Id. </em>at 121-122 (emphasis added).].[<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b564-7\">That is, a recital of rights at a <em>previous guilty plea hearing in the same case </em>of the rights that a defendant is waiving may suffice to satisfy the requirements of MCR 6.302. However, this Court has never before subscribed to the proposition that the mere fact that a jury, in a partial trial, has been instructed on a defendant\u2019s right to be presumed innocent is sufficient to obviate the specific requirements of the court rules.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark>\n<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b564-8\">The fundamental error that pervades the majority opinion is in its reading of <em>Guilty Plea Cases </em>and its holding that \u201cthere is substantial compliance with the \u2018personally address\u2019 requirement . . . even though the judge fails to recite a specific right at the guilty plea proceeding . . . .\u201d <em>Ante </em>at 280. The focus of the majority opinion in this regard is on the language found at 114-115 of <em>Guilty Plea Cases. </em>There, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>Court addressed the requirement of the rule that the judge \u201cpersonally address[] the defendant\u201d at the guilty plea hearing. The Court concluded in one of the twenty-four consolidated cases, <em>Courtney, </em>that the judge did not \u201cpersonally advise the defendant of the maximum sentence but in moving to add a second count the prosecutor stated the maximum penalty of five years.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 114. The Court next addressed <em>Bauer, </em>a case in which \u201cthe judge did not state the charge but the prosecutor read the information <em>on the plea record.\u201d Id. </em>(emphasis added).<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> This Court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-4\">These departures do not justify reversal. While it would be better for the judge to cover all the points himself, as long as he assumes the principal burden of imparting the required information, as did the judges in <em>Courtney </em>and <em>Bauer, </em>the purpose of requiring him personally to address the defendant and in so doing observe his demeanor and responses is achieved.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b565-5\">A guilty plea conviction will not be reversed if the judge engages in the required colloquy but fails to mention an item which the record shows was established through, <em>for example, an opening statement of or interjection by the prosecutor or defense counsel in the hearing of the judge and defendant. It is proper for the prosecutor or the clerk to read the information in the judge\u2019s presence. [Id. </em>at 114-115 (emphasis added).]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b565-6\">Both <em>Courtney </em>and <em>Bauer </em>involved the assessment of statements occurring <em>during the guilty plea hearing </em>itself in order to determine whether there had been substantial compliance with the rule. Contrary to the majority opinion, <em>Guilty Plea Cases </em>does not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>rely upon statements or events occurring outside the four comers of the guilty plea hearing.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Therefore, I reject its assertion that \u201ctwenty-five years\u201d of precedent establish that the required statements do not have to be made <em>at the guilty plea hearing. </em>Rather, the precedent cited in this opinion establishes that for twenty-five years, since the <em>Guilty Plea Cases, </em>Michigan courts have adhered to the principle that a defendant must be informed <em>at the guilty plea hearing </em>that he has a right to be presumed innocent. The majority\u2019s extrapolation from focusing upon substantial compliance <em>at </em>the guilty plea hearing to focusing upon substantial compliance over some indeterminate period surrounding the hearing runs counter to this well-established precedent. It also runs counter to the principle that, in order for a guilty plea to be knowing and voluntary, a defendant must be informed of the rights he is surrendering at that time, at that hearing at which he finally decides to admit guilt.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b566-6\">The majority seeks to distinguish the right to be presumed innocent until proved guilty from the rights identified in <em>Jaworski </em>of which a defendant <em>must </em>be informed.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> However, the mere fact that the <em>Jaworski </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>rights have not encompassed the presumption of innocence does not indicate that this right is of any less consequence or should be treated in any different fashion, nor does the majority suggest any rationale for such treatment. In <em>Russell, supra </em>at 629-630, the Court of Appeals noted that, in the <em>Guilty Plea Cases, </em>this Court \u201celevated the presumption of innocence to the same status as the three <em>Jaworski </em>rights.\u201d<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> See also <em>Johnson v Ohio, </em>419 US 924, 926; 95 S Ct 200; 42 L Ed 2d 158 (1974) (Douglas, J., dissenting), in which one justice, in dissenting to a denial of certiorari, observed that \u201c[t]he <em>Boykin </em>enumeration [of rights to which a pleading defendant is entitled to be advised] was illustrative, not exhaustive.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b568-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>V. RESPONSE TO THE CONCURRENCE</p>\n<p id=\"b568-6\">I also respectfully disagree with the concurrence that advising the defendant at his guilty plea hearing that he was relinquishing the right to have the jury decide whether his guilt could be proven beyond a reasonable doubt sufficiently imparted the idea that he was also relinquishing his right to be presumed innocent. MCR 6.302(B)(3)(c) requires a statement to the defendant that the judge, jury, and prosecutor are to presume his innocence until his guilt is proven. MCR 6.302(B)(3)(d) requires a separate statement informing the defendant that it is the prosecutor\u2019s burden to prove his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. Thus, subrules (c) and (d) are distinct requirements of the guilty plea hearing.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b569-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>The distinction between the presumption of innocence and the \u201creasonable doubt\u201d standards has been extensively discussed by the United States Supreme Court. <em>Coffin v United States, supra </em>at 460-461 (holding that a trial judge\u2019s failure to instruct the jury on the presumption of innocence required reversal, notwithstanding the adequacy of instructions provided on the closely related reasonable doubt standard). In <em>Coffin, </em>the Court traced the \u201cpresumption of innocence\u201d back to ancient law, and stated of the argument that \u201cproof beyond a reasonable doubt\u201d and \u201cpresumption of innocence\u201d are equivalent:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b569-4\">To say that the one is the equivalent of the other is therefore to say that legal evidence can be excluded from the jury, and that such exclusion may be cured by instructing them correctly in regard to the method by which they are required to reach their conclusion upon the proof actually before them; in other words, that the exclusion of an important element of proof can be justified by correctly instructing as to the proof admitted. The evolution of the principle of the presumption of innocence, and its resultant, the doctrine of reasonable doubt, make more apparent the correctness of these views, and indicate the necessity of enforcing the one in order that the other may continue to exist, <em>lid. </em>at 460.][<footnotemark>18</footnotemark>]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>Subsequently, in <em>Taylor v </em>Kentucky, 436 US 478, 484; 98 S Ct 1930; 56 L Ed 2d 468 (1978), the Supreme Court observed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b570-6\">[The requirement that a jury be informed both of the presumption of innocence and of the requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt] derives from a perceived salutary effect upon lay jurors. While the legal scholar may understand that the presumption of innocence and the prosecution\u2019s burden of proof are logically similar, the ordinary citizen well may draw significant additional guidance from an instruction on the presumption of innocence.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b570-7\">In my judgment, this reasoning applies with equal force to the guilty plea hearing, where a criminal defendant is faced with the decision to admit or deny guilt. Omitting the instruction on the presumption of innocence deprives such a defendant of an opportu<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>nity to fully assess his own circumstances and intelligently reflect upon his options.</p>\n<p id=\"b571-4\">While a scholar of the law may well recognize the close philosophical and constitutional connection between (indeed the inextricability of) the right to be presumed innocent and the right to be proved guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, MCR 6.302 understandably sets these apart as discrete rights to be explained to the pleading defendant. The rules do so because, considered together, these formulations explain more thoroughly and more clearly to the non-scholar, to the defendant, the full measure of the rights that he is rehnquishing by his guilty plea.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b571-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b571-6\">The <em>Guilty Plea Cases </em>established that a trial court\u2019s failure to comply with MCR 6.302 and advise the defendant of his right to be presumed innocent constituted error requiring reversal. Until today, this Court has not wavered from adherence to this principle. In my judgment, the trial court is obligated under the Michigan rule to inform the defendant of his presumption of innocence at the guilty plea hearing, and the extent to which there has been \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d with this obligation must be assessed in terms of what occurred at such hearing. Because there was a complete failure on the part of the trial court in this case to comply with MCR 6.302 by advis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>ing defendant, at his guilty plea hearing, of his right to be presumed innocent, I would affirm the Court of Appeals decision reversing defendant\u2019s conviction.</p>\n<judges id=\"b572-6\">Cavanagh and Kelly, JJ., concurred with Markman, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b553-8\"> MCR 6.302, in pertinent part, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b553-9\">(A) Plea Requirements.

Pew, if any, concepts are more deeply rooted in our traditions. . . . The layperson may quite naturally be quick to adjudge an accused guilty in his or her own mind and be sometimes joined by the press, particularly in America, but the Anglo-Saxon legal profession on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, and throughout the English-speaking world, has done its best to adhere to the time-honored principle that an accused person is presumed to be innocent until proved otherwise beyond a reasonable doubt by due process of law.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b560-8\"> Indeed, it appears that one fundamental difference between \u201cimprecise recitals,\u201d which we have deemed appropriate in most instances, and no recital at all, is that, with respect to the former, it can still be determined, however imperfectly, on the appellate review whether a defendant\u2019s plea has been made knowingly and voluntarily, whereas with the latter, it is impossible to conclude similarly because there is simply no record evidence at all.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b561-7\"> While I agree that the proper inquiry is whether the trial court has \u201csubstantially complied\u201d with the court rule, I disagree that a complete failure to make the required statements can nonetheless be characterized as \u201csubstantial\u201d compliance. It is not as if, for example, the court had advised the defendant that he had a right to be presumed \u201cnot guilty\u201d as opposed to being presumed \u201cinnocent.\u201d Rather, there has been no compliance at all. As noted, our jurisprudence clearly articulates that there is a substantial difference between \u201cimprecise recitals\u201d and situations in which the required statement advising the defendant of his rights is not made at all.

Defendant, at the time, may instead have been daydreaming or distracted or confused or consulting with his lawyer. The virtue of MCR 6.302 is that, because the court must <em>personally </em>address the defendant and take into consideration the nature of his response in determining whether to accept the guilty plea, appellate courts can be reasonably confident that a defendant has intelligently relinquished the full panoply of rights attendant to a jury trial.

Would the majority also conclude that no compliance with the rule is required for the defendant-lawyer or the defendant-judge because of his presumed knowledge of constitutional law? Simple adherence to the express requirements of the rule would avoid this Court having to determine which class of defendants possessed alternative means by which to become informed of the rights that they were relinquishing by a plea of guilty.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"10\">\n<p id=\"b564-10\"> See also <em>People v Jackson, </em>71 Mich App 468, 471-472; 248 NW2d 551 (1976) (Burns, J., dissenting), disagreeing with the majority\u2019s holding that advisement of a defendant\u2019s rights at a guilty plea hearing earlier in the day constituted sufficient waiver of his rights at a subsequent hearing, and citing the <em>Guilty Plea Cases, </em>noting that while the presumption of innocence is not a <em>Jaworski </em>right, this Court \u201chas deemed it necessary to continue to require reversal in cases where the guilty-pleading defendant is not advised of that incident of trial.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"11\">\n<p id=\"b565-7\"> <em>Courtney </em>and <em>Bauer </em>were the only two cases among the twenty-four cases consolidated in <em>Guilty Plea Cases </em>that specifically concerned the \u201cpersonally address\u201d requirement of MCR 6.302.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"12\">\n<p id=\"b566-7\"> One of the reasons for requiring that a guilty plea hearing be conducted in a discrete proceeding is to preserve the overall integrity of the defendant\u2019s decision to plead guilty.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"13\">\n<p id=\"b566-8\"> Further, contrary to the majority\u2019s statement at 14 that \u201c[t]he dissent has not identified any basis in the rule to support\u201d its position that trial judges must personally advise the defendant at the guilty plea hearing concerning the right to be presumed innocent, I believe that my position is adequately supported by the language of MCR 6.302(B).

That the juror must be so transformed ensures that the evidence used to convict a defendant will be powerful. Reasonable doubt requires only that a juror be subjectively certain that defendant committed the crime before voting for guilt.
