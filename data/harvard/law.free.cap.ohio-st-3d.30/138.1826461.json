The claim number assigned to this claim by the Ohio Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation is 32074-27.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b169-9\">\n<em>Per Curiam.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"A1X\">The narrow issue presented in this appeal is whether a writ of prohibiton will issue to prevent a court of common pleas from exercising appellate jurisdiction over a claimant\u2019s appeal from a decision of the Industrial Commission, where the claimant\u2019s notice of appeal erroneously states that he is appealing from the decision of the regional board of review, but otherwise complies with the technical requirements of R.C. 4123.519. For the following reasons, we hold that such writ will not issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b169-10\">As we noted in <em>State, ex rel. Rockwell Internatl., </em>v. <em>Ford </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St. 2d 234, 235, 15 O.O. 3d 250, 400 N.E. 2d 884, 885:</p>\n<p id=\"b169-11\">\u201cA writ of prohibition will issue only when: '(1) the court or officer against whom it is sought must be about to exercise judicial or quasi-judicial power; (2) the exercise of such power must amount to an unauthorized usurpation of judicial power; and (3) it must appear that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"140\">*140</page-number>refusal of the writ would result in an injury for which there is no adequate remedy.\u2019 <em>State, ex rel. D.P. &amp; L. Co., </em>v. <em>Kistler </em>(1979), 57 Ohio St. 2d 21, 22.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b170-5\">In <em>Rockwell, </em>we held that a writ of prohibition would issue to prevent a court of common pleas from proceeding in an underlying action where it had no jurisdiction over such action. We further held, relying on <em>Cadle </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp. </em>(1976), 45 Ohio St. 2d 28, 74 O.O. 2d 50, 340 N.E. 2d 403, that under R.C. 4123.519, a court of common pleas is not vested with jurisdiction over an appeal from the regional board of review when the claimant\u2019s notice of appeal states that he is appealing from the decision of the Industrial Commission, refusing to hear the claimant\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-6\">Earlier this term, in <em>Fisher </em>v. <em>Mayfield </em>(1987), 30 Ohio St. 3d 8, 30 OBR 16, 505 N.E. 2d 975, we overruled <em>Cadle </em>and replaced its harsh rule of strict compliance with R.C. 4123.519 with a rule of substantial compliance. Our syllabus in <em>Fisher </em>provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b170-7\">\u201c1. The jurisdictional requirements of R.C. 4123.519 are satisfied by the filing of a timely notice of appeal which is in substantial compliance with the dictates of that statute. <em>(Cadle </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp. </em>[1976], 45 Ohio St. 2d 28, 74 O.O. 2d 50, 340 N.E. 2d 403, overruled.)</p>\n<p id=\"b170-8\">\u201c2. Substantial compliance for jurisdictional purposes occurs when a timely notice of appeal filed pursuant to R.C. 4123.519 includes sufficient information, in intelligible form, to place on notice all parties to a proceeding that an appeal has been filed from an identifiable final order which has determined the parties\u2019 substantive rights and liabilities.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b170-9\">In the case <em>sub judice, </em>Shelton\u2019s notice of appeal included \u201csufficient information, in intelligible form,\u201d to place all parties on notice that he was appealing \u201cfrom an identifiable final order which has determined the parties\u2019 substantive rights and liabilities.\u201d The notice of appeal clearly and correctly stated Shelton\u2019s and Ernest\u2019s names and the number assigned to Shelton\u2019s claim, accurately set forth the dates of the decisions of the regional board and the Industrial Commission staff hearing officers, and undeniably indicated the fact that Shelton was appealing. Here, as in <em>Fisher, \u201c* </em>*.* [n]o party has alleged, and no party can now demonstrate, surprise or unfair prejudice to its interest.\u201d 30 Ohio St. 3d at 11, 30 OBR at 19, 505 N.E. 2d at 978.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-10\">Therefore, we hold that Shelton\u2019s notice of appeal substantially complied with R.C. 4123.519 and thus vested the court of common pleas with jurisdiction over his appeal. Hence, no writ of prohibition will issue to prevent Judge Fuerst from proceeding with that appeal, as the three-prong test for such issuance set forth in <em>Rockwell </em>cannot be satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-11\">Accordingly, the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-12\">\n<em>Judgment affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b170-13\">Sweeney, Locher, Holmes, Douglas and H. Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b170-14\">Moyer, C.J., and Wright, J., concur in judgment only.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
