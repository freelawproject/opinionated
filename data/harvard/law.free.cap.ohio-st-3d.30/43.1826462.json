Nevertheless appellant would have us overrule <em>Philada. </em>To do so would be to abandon the long-standing exclusive-use rule. That rule, succinctly reiterated in <em>National Church Residences </em>v. <em>Lindley </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St. 3d 53, 18 OBR 87, 479 N.E. 2d 870, which approved <em>Philada, </em>at 55, 18 OBR at 89, 479 N.E. 2d at 873, \u201c* * * is that the furnishing of low-cost housing at or below market prices, where residents pay a part or all of their rental costs, is not, in and of itself, an exclusive use of the property for charitable purposes.\u201d We decline to abandon such rule, which arose from our function of judicial interpretation, and any change thereof is, of course, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>prerogative of the General Assembly. At the same time we endorse the Board of Tax Appeals\u2019 statement that, \u201c* * * [we admire] the appellant\u2019s intent and dedication, and we commend its benevolence and kindness toward women in need. * * *\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b75-6\">Accordingly, we hold that R.C. 5709.12 was neither unreasonably nor unlawfully construed by the board in the instant case and we therefore affirm its decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-7\">\n<em>Decision affirmed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b75-8\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Holmes, Douglas and H. Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b75-9\">Locher and Wright, JJ., concur in judgment only.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b74-13\"> We note that appellant does not raise any claim for exemption of such property under R.C. 5709.12 as a \u201c* * * home for the aged, as defined in section 5701.13 of the Revised Code * * R.C. 5701.13 sets forth detailed criteria necessary to qualify for tax-exempt status as a \u201chome for the aged,\u201d which include the availability of medical, nursing and additional services for full care. The absence of such services here is the obvious reason that no claim for exemption under R.C. 5709.12 is urged by appellant.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b75-10\">Locher, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AdZ\">concurring in judgment only. I recognize that the instant case does not involve any claim for exemption of the property in question under R.C. 5709.12 as a <em>\u201c* </em>* * home for the aged, as defined in section 5701.13 of the Revised Code * * However, I also recognize that the average age of the residents at Cogswell Hall is between seventy-eight and eighty years.</p>\n<p id=\"b75-11\">Thus, I concur separately for the reasons expressed in my concurrence in part and dissent in part in <em>Ohio Presbyterian Homes </em>v. <em>Kinney </em>(1984), 9 Ohio St. 3d 90, 96, 9 OBR 319, 324, 459 N.E.2d 500, 505. I once again strongly urge the legislature to weigh the results of today\u2019s decision against the contributions of this state\u2019s senior citizens and remedy the technicalities that negate the debt we owe to them.</p>\n<judges id=\"b75-12\">Wright, J., concurs in the foregoing opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
