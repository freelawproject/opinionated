We hold that R.C. 2945.67 is inapplicable to the state\u2019s right of direct appeal in expungement cases for the reason that expungement under R.C. 2953.32 is a postconviction relief proceeding, remedial in nature, and is governed by the Ohio Rules of Appellate Procedure as applicable to civil actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-5\">Our holding follows paragraph two of the syllabus in <em>State </em>v. <em>Nichols </em>(1984), 11 Ohio St. 3d 40, 11 OBR 188, 463 N.E. 2d 375, wherein this court ruled that \u201c[p]ostconviction relief proceedings [are] governed by the Ohio Rules of Appellate Procedure as applicable to civil actions.\u201d The <em>Nichols </em>court determined that R.C. Chapter 2953 does not explicitly mandate the use of the Rules of Appellate Procedure as applicable to criminal cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-6\">We further observe that this court, considering R.C. 2953.31 <em>et seq. </em>in <em>Barker </em>v. <em>State </em>(1980), 62 Ohio St. 2d 35, 16 O.O. 3d 22, 402 N.E. 2d 550, determined the statute to be remedial in nature and subject to liberal construction as mandated by R.C. 1.11.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-7\">It therefore follows that appellant had a civil right of appeal in the instant matter, and that the court of appeals committed error in dismissing the appeal upon the premise that it was without jurisdiction of the appeal as a criminal matter under R.C. 2945.67.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-8\">We do not here reach the merits of the state\u2019s appeal as to whether the trial court committed error in granting expungement under R.C. 2953.31 <em>et seq. </em>to one convicted of soliciting a bribe while holding office as a public official.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-9\">The judgment of the court of appeals is hereby reversed, and the cause is remanded to that court for disposition on its merits.</p>\n<p id=\"b151-10\">\n<em>Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b151-11\">Moyer, C.J., Ford, Holmes, Douglas, Wright and H.
