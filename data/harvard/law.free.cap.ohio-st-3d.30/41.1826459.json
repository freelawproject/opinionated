The trial judge had not, as required by Civ. R. 41(B), given notice to plaintiffs\u2019 counsel prior to issuing that order. The order of vacation came within two weeks of the dismissal and specified that the case be reinstated on the court\u2019s docket.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-13\">It has long been settled that, during a term of court, a trial court has inherent discretion with respect to its orders. In <em>Niles </em>v. <em>Parks </em>(1892), 49 Ohio St. 370, 371, 34 N.E. 735, 736, it was held: \u201cThe court of common pleas had complete control over its own orders during the term at which they were entered, and might set aside the sale and entry of confirmation, at its discretion.\u201d See, also, <em>Huntington &amp; McIntyre </em>v. <em>W.M. Finch &amp; Co. </em>(1854), 3 Ohio St. 445; <em>Knox County Bank </em>v. <em>Doty </em>(1859), 9 Ohio St. 506; <em>Huber Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>Sweny </em>(1897), 57 Ohio St. 169, 48 N.E. 879; <em>Wagner </em>v. <em>Long </em>(1937), 133 Ohio St. 41, 10 O.O. 11, 11 N.E. 2d 247.</p>\n<p id=\"b72-14\">The trial court\u2019s inherent power with respect to its docket has been modified by statute. R.C. 2505.02 defines a final order as \u201c* * * an order vacating or setting aside a judgment and ordering a new trial.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b72-15\">The order of the trial judge on September 4, 1984 is not equivalent to \u201cordering a new trial\u201d since no trial in the case <em>subjudice </em>was ever held. Accordingly, the order of September 4, 1984 vacating the dismissal and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>reinstating the case to the trial court\u2019s docket remains within the trial court\u2019s inherent power and was not a final appealable order.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-5\">Inasmuch as we hold that the order of September 4, 1984 was not a final appealable order, the court of appeals lacked jurisdiction to undertake a review of that order and to mandate a dismissal of the case for want of prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-6\">Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and order the cause reinstated on the docket of the Court of Common Pleas of Erie County.</p>\n<p id=\"b73-7\">\n<em>Judgment reversed.</em>\n</p>\n<judges id=\"b73-8\">Moyer, C.J., Sweeney, Locher, Hildebrandt, Douglas, Wright and H. Brown, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b73-9\">Hildebrandt, J., of the First Appellate District, sitting for Holmes, J.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b72-16\"> The legislature has amended R.C. 2505.02, effective March 17,1987. The definition of a \u201cfinal order\u201d as \u201c* * * an order vacating or setting aside a judgment <em>and </em>ordering a new trial * * *\u201d has been changed to \u201c* ** an order that vacates or sets aside a judgment <em>or </em>grants a new trial * * (Emphasis added.) Whether an order vacating a judgment is, by this statutory change, made a final appealable order, is a question we need not address.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
