No objection was made to the certificate by the association on account of such omission, and the secretary, in a letter to plaintiff acknowledging receipt of same, spoke of it as \u201csubstituting your name as beneficiary. \u201d <em>Held, </em>that such declaration was evidence against the association, warranting a verdict that a change of beneficiary had been duly effected; there being no evidence that the acts required of th\u00e9 association to effect the change had not been done.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b90-7\">Appeal from circuit court, Ulster county.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b90-8\">Appeal by the Equitable Reserve Fund Life Association, defendant, from a judgment in favor of the plaintiff, John M. Mayer, entered upon the verdict of the j ury upon the trial at the Ulster county circuit; also from the order denying the motion made by the defendant upon the minutes to set aside the verdict, and grant a new trial. The action was brought by the plaintiff to recover as assignee upon a certificate of membership issued by the defendant to Charles Stephan. This certificate was a contract of insurance upon the life of Stephan for $5,000, subject to certain terms and conditions. The defendant answered, and alleged a breach of the warranties upon which the certificate was issued; fraud, collusion, and misrepresentation in its procurement; no title in the plaintiff. The certificate of membership, constituting the contract for insurance, provided that \u201cin consideration of the representations, warranties, and agreements made to and with this association in the application for this certificate of membership,\u201d and the payment, etc., the defendant receives Charles Stephan \u201cinto its membership,\u201d and agrees \u201cthat, within ninety days after the receipt of due notice,and satisfactory proofs of the death of the above-named-member during the continuance of this certificate of membership, there shall be payable to the heirs or legal representatives of said member the sum of $5,0U0 from the death fund,\u201d etc. The certificate recites that it is \u201csubject to all the provisions contained in the constitution and by-laws of the association,\u201d and also that it is issued and accepted \u201csubject to the express conditions that * * * if any of the statements, answers, declarations, or representations made in or accompanying the application for this certificate, which application is hereby referred to and made a part hereof, are in any respect untrue, then, in each and every such case, this certificate shall cease and determine, and be null and void.\u201d The application was signed by Charles Stephan. It contained numerous questions, and recited that the applicant-should answer \u201cfully and truly, with representations upon which, as part consideration, the certificate, if issued, will be based.\u201d The application contained this declaration: \u201cIt is hereby declared and warranted that the foregoing answers and statements are full, complete, and true, and it is agreed that this declaration and warranty shall form the basis and shall be a part of the contract between the undersigned and the Equitable Reserve Fund Life Association, and are offered to said association as a consideration of the con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"81\">*81</page-number>tract applied for, \u201d etc. Accompanying the appplication is the medical examiner\u2019s report\u2018containing a list of printed questions to which the applicant made answers, and signed a declaration similar to the above. The defendant is an association organized under chapter 175, Laws 1883, for the purpose of transacting the business of life insurance upon the \u201cassessment plan. \u201d</summary>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b91-4\">Argued before Learned, P.

Upon the trial much testimony was given on the part of the defendant tending to show that several of the answers made by the insured in his application and upon his medical examination were not \u201cfully and truly\u201d answered. According to the terms of the contract, these answers were warranties; and, if not fully and truly made, the contract was, by its own terms, void. Such was the agreement of the parties to it,\u2014an agreement which it is hardly necessary to say it was entirely competent for the parties to make, and which the court cannot unmake, but must accept as made, and enforce. <em>Foot </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>61 N. Y. 571; <em>Cushman </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>63 N. Y. 404; <em>Baker </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>64 N. Y. 648; <em>Edington </em>v. <em>Insurance Co., </em>77 N. Y. 564, 100 N.

In the application<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> made by the insured, there was one question, the eighth, which required an answer respecting the age, health, etc., of the father, mother, brothers and sisters, and grandparents of the insured. The question was: \u201cState, so far as you know, what was the age at death, cause of death, duration of final illness, and state of previous health, of each of the following persons, if deceased? What is the age and present state of health of each of them if now living?\u201d Following this question were these, among others: <em>Ninth. </em>\u201cAre you now in good health, and is your health usually good?\u201d The answer was, \u201cYes.\u201d <em>Tenth. </em>\u201cHave you ever had any serious illness, local disease, or personal injury. If yes, state nature, date, and duration and severity of attack.\u201d The answer was, \u201cHo.\u201d <em>Fourteenth. </em>\u201cHome and residence of your usual medical attendant?\u201d The answer was, \u201cHone.\u201d The testimony on the part of the defense tended to show that the answers given were false. The court charged the jury that the qualification in the eighth question, \u201cso far as you know,\u201d was implied and understood in each of the other questions. The court said, referring to the latter questions and the answers to them: \u201cIf he [the insured] does answer, according to the judgment of the jury, fairly and honestly, then he has performed his warranty.\u201d We think the learned judge fell into an error. The qualifying words in the eighth question are manifestly inserted because the insured is called upon to speak with respect to the health, etc., of others. He was supposed to have some, but possibly he had only small, knowledge of the matters inquired of. Respecting himself, and his own health and medical attendant, he was presumed to know. If the charge of the court in this respect is sustained, then the insured, whose warranty required him to answer \u201cfully and truly,\u201d might with entire safety have answered falsely and partly, if the jury should think they could excuse him upon the ground that he answered \u201cfairly and honestly.\u201d It is not difficult to see that such a definition of the terms of the contract opened the way for the jury to hold the defendant liable, although every answer of the insured might have been false, and known by him to be so. It substituted for the fact itself an inquiry into the dead man\u2019s belief respecting the fact. It is enough to say that the defendant had entered into no contract requiring it to abide such a hazard.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">The defendant urges that the plaintiff has no title to the certificate or to the claim against the defendant, if any valid claim exists. The eighteenth sec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"82\">*82</page-number>tian of the act under which the defendant was organized (chapter 175, Laws 1883) gives a member the right, with the consent of the association, to make a change in his beneficiary. The act gives the association power to make by-laws for the conduct of its affairs. Section 4. The defendant\u2019s by-laws provided that the member desiring to change his beneficiary should execute a certificate before a notary public or other proper officer, \u201cin such form as the executive committee shall prescribe or appoint,\u201d stating his name in full, number of certificate, name and place of residence of the beneficiary whom he desires to substitute, name or names of those whom he desires to supersede, and file' it with the secretary of the association, who shall, upon its receipt, immediately examine it, and if in due form, duly executed and acknowledged, he shall make the proper entries to show that the change has been made. \u201cNo change of beneficiary shall be effectual unless the certificate thereof shall have been filed, examined, and found correct, and the necessary change made in the records of the association, before the receipt of notice of the death of such member.\u201d Here Charles Stephan, the insured, executed and acknowledged an assignment before a notary public on the 25th day of October, 1883, and delivered it to the plaintiff. The assignment complied with all the specified requirements of the by-laws, except it did not give the names of the beneficiaries to be superseded. It was delivered to the secretary of the defendant on or previous to November 19, 1883. On that day the secretary wrote to the plaintiff that \u201cthe association has to inform you that it duly received a certificate made by Charles Stephan substituting your name as the beneficiary of his certificate of membership in this association. Such certificate is numbered 244. \u201d No objection was taken to the form, contents, or omissions of the assignment. The defendant spoke of it as \u201csubstituting your name as beneficiary;\u201d and we think that declaration is evidence against the defendant sufficient to support a verdict that the assignment had been duly examined, filed, approved, and the proper entry made, and the change in beneficiary effected. There is no evidence that these acts were not done by the association. Our examination leads to the conclusion that the law does not defeat the plaintiff\u2019s right of recovery upon the ground of defects in his paper title, but makes it dependent upon the issues of fact.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">As there must be a new trial for the reasons first assigned, we do not deem it needful to examine the other grounds of error alleged, since, upon a new trial, they may not arise. The judgment should be reversed; a new trial granted; costs to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">Learned, P. J., concurs. Ingalls, J., not sitting.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
