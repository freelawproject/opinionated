Persons taxed in cities cannot be constitutionally subjected to a different kind of government. Towns and cities are corporate bodies, but their corporate character has no more political influence than the corporate character of a private corporation. Abroad, the corporate character of cities has been exalted and exaggerated until cities, as corporate bodies, and frequently as chartered corporate bodies have become tyrannical and oppressive, disregarding and working an atrophy of the rights of the citizen. Here the inhabitants of cities are, equally with the inhabitants of towns, entitled to the protection of the constitution. Cities are towns no longer meeting in a popular assembly, but meeting in select committee in some form chosen by the people,-as a common council. In Brooklyn the wards of the city are by statute declared to be towns of the county of Kings. Chapter 863, Laws 1873, tits. 2, 3.. If it is unconstitutional to tax persons in the towns and counties by legislative commission, it is unconstitutional to tax them in the city of Brooklyn by legislative commission. There is no warrant, express or implied, for the delegation of the absolute power of taxation for expenses incurred in executing the powers inherent in a city, except to the city as a community, or the county board of supervisors. If delegated to the city, such delegated absolute authority must be exercised by the mayor, aldermen, and commonalty in common council convened, or by some similar board chosen by the citizens. There is no warrant, express or implied, for the' delegation of the power of absolute taxation for general town, county, or city purposes to a commission appointed by the legislature. Any other construction of the constitution permits the legislature to destroy the county organization for fiscal purposes in every county. It would permit the arbitrary construction and reconstruction of schemes of local government, and their establishment in Brooklyn, or in any part of the state, under the pretense of organizing a city. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Acton, </em>48 Barb. 524, it was decided that the legislature cannot create a commission with power to enact a municipal by-law. <em>A fortiori, </em>the legislature cannot invest a commission with an absolute power of taxation.</p>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b98-5\">Barnard,P. J.</author>\n<p id=\"A4I\">The argument against the constitutionality of the arrears law of Brooklyn rests principally upon the lack of power in the legislature to delegate the right of taxation to a board of commissioners. The legislative power of taxation is very great, and the right to delegate it to towns, villages, and municipal agencies is constantly practiced and recognized, and has been for many years. The assessors of the city of Brooklyn are a city agency in respect to taxation, and I do not understand the appellant to question the legality of a tax imposed upon real property through the regular action of this board of assessors. If the arrears of taxes are legally imposed, then the delegation of the authority to remit a portion of the tax so in arrears can in no proper sense be' deemed an imposition of the tax. The tax was imposed and was unpaid, and the land-owner is in no position to object to the reduction of a legal tax. The law apparently is for his benefit, and is designed to collect a less sum in lieu of a greater one legally existing against the land. The arrear is not a new tax, but an abatement of the old; and the argument that the legislature cannot delegate the power of taxation to a commission has no relevancy or force. Ho additional obligation could be imposed by the commission. The law is not liable to objections in other respects. It provides for a hearing even when the proposal is to reduce the amount to be paid by the land. The right to sell follows the right to tax at all. It provides for a list of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>conclusions of the commission, and for its delivery to all applicants, and it provides for redemption, after sale, for 12 months. It requires a notice of the sale, to be given to every record owner, or person interested in the title by mortgage thereon. A great indebtedness of the city of Brooklyn, occasioned by the default of those who were assessed for their property, could not be met by a more humane law, both in its justice and in the provisions for its execution. Judgment should therefore be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-5\">Pratt, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
