McKenzie, 42 N. Y. Super. Ct. 192. An attorney has a lien for his services from the commencement of an action, * * * which attaches to a verdict * * * or judgment in his client\u2019s favor, * * * and cannot be affected by any settlement between the parties, before or after judgment. Code Civil Proc. \u00a7 66. And no notice of lien on a judgment which is exclusively for cbsts and disbursements Is required, as the record itself is sufficient notice of lien. <em>Wright </em>v. <em>Fleming, </em>10 Wkly. Dig. 450. The record of the judgment is notice to all the parties to the action of the existence of such lien. <em>Lesher </em>v. <em>Roessner, </em>3 Hun, 217. And such lien cannot be discharged by payment to any one but the attorney. <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Meech, </em>51 N. Y. 143. Besides, the rights of the plaintiff\u2019s attorney in the judgment for $86.34, were passed upon by Chief Justice McAdam, on December 14, 1887, in <em>Kaufman </em>v. <em>Keenan, </em>13 Civ. Proc. R. 225, in which it was held that the judgment for costs, $86.34, was owned by the plaintiff\u2019s attorney. The order made therein not having been vacated.or reversed, the question of the plaintiff\u2019s attorney\u2019s rights in said judgment is <em>res adjudicata. </em>The order appealed from must therefore be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b406-5\">Pitshke, J., concurring.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
