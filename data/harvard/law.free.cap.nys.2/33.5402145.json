Inspection of the case, however, shows that the appellant is estopped to raise either of these questions. It is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number>true, the respondent\u2019s notice was that the judgment, a copy of which he served, had been duly filed, instead of entered, in the office of the county clerk. When the judgment of dismissal of the complaint was served, the appellant\u2019s attorney admitted in writing, over his signature, \u201cdue and timely service of a copy of the within judgment and notice of entry. \u201d Upon the judgment for costs being served, the appellant\u2019s attorney submitted due and timely service of a copy of that paper also. The appellant, having thus admitted due and timely service of the papers and of the entry of the judgment dismissing the complaint, cannot be heard afterwards to claim that there was any irregularity in the mode of service or in the contents of the notices. Moreover, a notice of the filing with the clerk of a judgment, accompanying the service of a judgment upon the defeated party, is tantamount to a notice of the entry of the judgment. An attorney can do no more than to file with the clerk the papers in the action, and the law immediately makes it the duty of the clerk, if the paper be a judgment, to enter, it in the proper book provided for that purpose. It follows that the order should be affirmed, with costs and disbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b44-5\">Van Brunt, P. J., and Bartlett, J., concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
