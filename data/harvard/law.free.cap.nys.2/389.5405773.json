Durant and others against the East River Electric Light Company for certain chattels alleged to be in premises leased by and in possession of defendant.

The answer discloses the date of the lease, (January 4, 1888;) the parties thereto, (the plaintiffs and defendant herein;) the premises leased; and the chattels claimed under said lease, viz., the chattels named in the complaint. Ample provision is made in the Code for an inspection, and a copy of the lease, if required by the plaintiff, (Code Civil Proc. \u00a7 80S;) and also for its production upon the trial. The-claim of the defendant is set forth in his answer witli sufficient definiteness to enable the plaintiff to prepare for trial-. A party cannot obtain his opponent\u2019s evidence by a motion to make his pleading more definite and certain, but, if entitled to, must seek it either under the provision of the Code, permitting an examination of the party before trial, or requiring the service of a bill of particulars. <em>Agnew </em>v. <em>Railroad Co., </em>13 Civ. Proc. R. 25. A bill of particulars is the appropriate remedy where the party seeks to be fully apprised of the particulars or circumstances of time and place of the matters set forth in his opponent\u2019s plead<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"391\">*391</page-number>ings. <em>Tilton </em>v. <em>Beecher, </em>59 N. Y. 176. An order requiring a complaint to be made more definite and certain may involve a substantial right, and if so is appealable. <em>Brownell </em>v. <em>Bank, </em>13 Wkly. Dig. 371. The order appealed from must be reversed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-5\">Nehrbas, J., concurring.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
