The paper that purports to be an .assignment is not acknowledged, nor is there an iota of proof of the defendant\u2019s signature, of the delivery of.the paper, or of the time of its execution. A singular feature of the case is that the attorney to whom it is said the assignment was made has not sworn that the assignment was for value, or that .lie ever received it, or that it was given to him at the date that appears upon \u00e1ts face. He has not claimed any lien, nor has he asserted that anything is \u2022due to him. A paper, unproved, unauthenticated, unvouclied for,\u2014a paper \u2022that- ought not to have been read until some one\u2019s oath had lent to it at least the Authority of an exhibit, is all that there is to show that any assignment was ever made. There is not, ns we have already said, the slightest proof that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"717\">*717</page-number>the attorney has, or ever had, a lien, or that liis client ever owed him a dollar; and the attorney who might have proved these things\u2014if they were susceptible of proof\u2014is silent. Upon this state of facts, no question can arise as to-the validity or the legal effect of the supposed assignment. There is no assignihhnt before the court. The order appealed from is reversed, with costs- and disbursements.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
