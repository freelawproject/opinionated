The action was to recover $2,000, the contract price. Upon the proofs the plaintiff may not have been entitled to recover this sum; but it does not follow, where the contract price was payable in installments every two weeks, as the work\u2022 progressed, that the plaintiff was entitled to recover nothing. The trial judge dismissed the complaint, but the'printed case fails to show the ground- upon wrhich the dismissal w7as granted. The defects in the plaintiff\u2019s proofs ought to have been specifically pointed out, that the plaintiff might have supplied the deficiencies. <em>Devoe </em>v. <em>Brandt, </em>58 Barb. 493; <em>Newton </em>v. <em>Harris, </em>6 N. Y. 345; <em>Binsse </em>v. <em>Wood, </em>37 N. Y. 526. Upon the record, as it stands, the judgment appealed from must be reversed, and a new trial ordered, w7ith costs to abide the event.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
