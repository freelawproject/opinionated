J.</author>\n<p id=\"Ax4\">In 1859, Elvira Harbeck deposited with the Bowery Savings-Bank $350. \u201cfor Henrietta Barker.\u201d The law in respect to such deposits is now very well settled. Mrs. Harbeck either deposited Henrietta Barker\u2019s money, or constituted herself a trustee of the fund by a completed gift of the money deposited. <em>Martin </em>v. <em>Funk, </em>75 N. Y. 134; <em>Mabie </em>v. <em>Bailey, </em>95 N. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>Y. 206; <em>Young </em>v. <em>Young, </em>80 N. Y. 482. It is proven that after the deposit remained some years Mrs. Harbeck, the trustee, drew it out, and applied it to her own use. If the gift was complete when the trustee drew out the money, she held it as trustee. <em>Mabie </em>v. <em>Bailey, supra.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b436-5\">The remaining question is one of fact upon the question of the identity o\u00ed the plaintiff\u2019s intestate. The deposit was made for Henrietta Barker, as has been stated. Mrs. Barker was a sister of Mrs. Harbeck, and* her name was Harriet. There was no other member of Mrs. Harbeck\u2019s family who was named Barker, and there was none who were named either Harriet, Henrietta, or Harrietta. The evidence established that the deceased, Mrs. Harbeck, declared that Mrs. Barker\u2019s name was Harrietta. The deposit is*for Henrietta. The jury have found in favor of the plaintiff\u2019s intestate, and it is difficult to arrive at any other conclusion. The donor or trustee meant some one, and Mrs. Barker can be selected as the proper donee, although there was a difference as to the fact whether Harriet, Harrietta, or Henrietta. The real donee is quite plainly proven. The verdict of the jury, therefore, rests upon suffir cient evidence, and the judgment should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-6\">Pratt, J., concurs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
