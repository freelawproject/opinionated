Owners and operators of the two vessels involved in the collision filed suit under the Limitation of Liability Act (the \u201cAct\u201d)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> in federal district court seeking to limit their respective liabilities to the values of the respective vessels. The district court held that the shipowners were entitled to limit their liability and thus stayed concurrent state court actions involving the incident. The district court subsequently held, inter alia, that both shipowners were entitled to exoneration from liability to one of the claimants \u2014 Defendant-Appellant Harris Jar-reau \u2014 as he had failed to prove medical causation, <em>i.e., </em>that he was injured in the accident. Jarreau appealed, arguing that the court erred by (1) staying state court proceedings, and (2) concluding that both shipowners were entitled to exoneration from liability for his claims. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS</p>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">Underway at night, the lead barge in the tow of the MTV MISS CAROLYN, a vessel owned by the Port Arthur Towing Company, Inc. (\u201cPATCO\u201d), rammed the stern of the M/V JOHN W., a vessel owned by John W. Towing, Inc. (\u201cJWT\u201d). As a result of this collision, several seamen, including Jarreau and Defendant-Appellee Joshua Verdin, both serving on the MW JOHN W. at the time, filed suit in state court stating claims under the Jones Act and General Maritime Law for injuries that they allegedly suffered in the mishap.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b380-15\">In response, JWT and PATCO filed separate limitation complaints in federal district court, invoking that court\u2019s admiralty jurisdiction and praying for exoneration from or limitation of liability on claims arising from the collision. These actions were consolidated, after which JWT filed a cross claim against PATCO seeking indemnification, court costs, and attorneys\u2019 fees. All parties agreed to have the cases adjudicated by a magistrate judge.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-16\">A concursus was deposited into the registry of the district court, which then issued an order staying all related state court proceedings. Jarreau, Verdin, and JWT tried to negotiate a mutually agreeable stipulation that would enable Jarreau and Verdin to have the stay lifted and pursue their claims in state court. Agreement on a mutually acceptable stipulation could never be reached, however, so the three parties voluntarily abandoned their efforts to produce such a stipulation. Eventually Jarreau and Verdin \u2014 but not JWT \u2014 did enter into a stipulation, then moved the court to lift the order staying the state court actions. But as JWT was not a party to the agreement, the court denied this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-17\">The district court conducted a hearing, at the conclusion of which it exonerated JWT from all liability and found PATCO solely responsible for the collision. The magistrate judge then determined after a bench trial that Jarreau had not proved that he sustained any injury as a result of the collision; thus PATCO was entitled to exoneration from Jarreau\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-18\">The court found that, although Jarreau chronically suffers from degenerative disc pathology, his condition did not result from the collision but antedated it. Dr. Edmund C. Landry, Jr., an orthopedic surgeon who examined Jarreau at the request of PATCO and JWT, stated that x-rays of Jarreau\u2019s back taken less than a month after the acci<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"315\">*315</page-number>dent showed that the degenerative change predated the accident by more than a year and probably resulted from some prior trauma. Dr. John D. Jackson, Jarreau\u2019s treating physician who did not review the x-rays, could not say that the objective pathology was caused by the collision. Jarreau testified that he had no prior back problems and that his back started hurting either immediately or shortly after the accident.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">After considering this evidence, the court concluded that \u201cthere is no objective evidence to aid the doctors in determining whether Jarreau, in fact, was injured in the accident at issue. This determination is totally dependent upon Jarreau\u2019s credibility when he says that he had no prior back problems but had the onset of pain either immediately or shortly after the accident.\u201d The court then considered evidence bearing on Jarreau\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">In the court\u2019s recap of that evidence, it noted that (1) the captain of the M/V MISS CAROLYN testified that immediately after the accident Jarreau stated that he was not injured; (2) another crew member of the M/V MISS CAROLYN testified that Jarreau told him that he was not injured, but that he was going to sue anyway; and (3) four to five days after the accident Jarreau gave a statement in which he denied being injured. In addition to these statements, which were inconsistent with Jarreau\u2019s trial testimony, the court noted that Jarreau\u2019s manner and demeanor on the witness stand weighed against his credibility. Accordingly, the court found Jarreau\u2019s testimony not credible and ruled that he had failed to establish that he was injured in the collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">Jarreau appealed, contending that the court erred in denying his motion to lift the order staying the state court proceedings, and in finding that PATCO and JWT were entitled to exoneration from liability for his claims, because Jarreau had failed to prove that the collision caused his injuries.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b381-12\">ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b381-13\">A. Staying the State Co\u00fcRt Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b381-14\">A shipowner facing potential liability for a maritime accident may file suit in federal court seeking protection under the Act, a statute that permits a shipowner to limit his liability for damages or injuries arising from a maritime accident to \u201cthe amount or value of the interest of such owner in such vessel, and her freight then pending,\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> if the accident occurred without the shipowner\u2019s \u201cprivity or knowledge.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> \u201cWhen a shipowner files a complaint seeking limited liability, the federal district court stays all related claims against the shipowner pending in any forum, and requires all claimants to assert their claims in the limitation court.\u201d<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> This accords with the federal courts\u2019 exclusive jurisdiction of suits brought under the Act.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b381-15\">Although it has granted such exclusive jurisdiction to the federal courts, Congress has also \u201c \u2018sav[ed] to suitors ... all other remedies to which they are otherwise entitled\u2019 \u201d (the \u201csaving-to-suitors clause\u201d).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We have previously recognized that \u201cthis statutory framework has created \u2018recurring and inherent conflict\u2019 between the saving-to-suitors clause, with its \u2018presumption in favor of jury trials and common law remedies,\u2019 and the \u2018apparent exclusive jurisdiction\u2019 vested in the admiralty courts by the Act.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> In con<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"316\">*316</page-number>nection with this tension, we have noted that \u201c[t]he court\u2019s primary concern is to protect the shipowner\u2019s absolute right to claim the Act\u2019s liability cap, and to reserve the adjudication of that right in the federal forum.\u201d<footnotemark>10</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">The Act therefore is directed at maritime misfortunes in which the losses claimed exceed the value of the vessel and its freight.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> But when a shipowner is not exposed to potential liability in excess of that amount, the shipowner\u2019s absolute right to limit its liability is not implicated and \u201cthe saving-to-suitors clause dictates that the admiralty court <em>must </em>allow suits pending against the shipowner in a common law forum, in this ease the state court, to proceed.\u201d <footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Over the years, courts have identified several exceptional circumstances in which a district court must permit a state action to proceed, even though a limitation action has been filed in federal court. Today we must determine whether the district court was here faced with such a situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">1. <em>When A Stay Is Appropriate</em></p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">As we recently explained, \u201c[cjlaims may proceed outside the limitations action (1) if they total less than the value of the vessel, or (2) if [all] claimants stipulate that the federal court has exclusive jurisdiction over the limitation of liability proceeding and that [the claimants] will not seek to enforce a greater damage award until the limitation action has been heard by the federal court.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> In this case, multiple claimants sought more in damages than the total value of the vessels and their pending cargo; thus, to proceed in state court, all claimants were first required to enter into a stipulation that would protect the shipowner\u2019s right to limit its liability.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-11\">2. <em>Adequacy of the Stipulation</em></p>\n<p id=\"b382-12\">The district court denied Jarreau\u2019s motion to lift the order staying his state court action, finding that the claimants had not entered into a stipulation sufficient to protect PATCO\u2019s interests. Jarreau argues that this was error, insisting that both he and Verdin, the only other crew member remaining in the suit at that time, had proposed an adequate stipulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-13\">But the record is clear that the stipulation proposed by Jarreau and Verdin was inadequate to protect PATCO\u2019s right to limit its liabilities: That agreement would not have bound all necessary parties. Even though they eventually agreed between themselves to the terms of a proposed stipulation, Jar-reau and Verdin never convinced JWT to enter into it. Yet JWT was a codefendant with a cross claim against PATCO seeking damages, attorneys\u2019 fees and costs. Indeed, the fact that Jarreau, Verdin, and JWT were unable to arrive at an acceptable stipulation among themselves was confirmed when they informed the district court that they had abandoned all efforts to obtain a mutually agreeable stipulation, after which Jarreau and Verdin proceeded to try their cases before that court.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-14\">On this point the law is clear: When the aggregate of the damages being sought by all claimants exceeds the value of the concursus, actions in state court cannot proceed unless <em>all </em>claimants enter into a stipulation that adequately protects the shipowner which has filed a complaint in federal court seeking to limit its liability.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> We recently stated that a \u201cclaimant\u201d in this context includes a code-fendant who is asserting a cross claim for indemnification, costs, and attorneys\u2019 fees.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"317\">*317</page-number>As none dispute that JWT was doing precisely that, or that JWT refused to enter into a stipulation with Jarreau and Verdin, PATCO would have been exposed to a multiple elaim-ant/inadequate fund situation had Jarreau been permitted to pursue his action in state court.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Clearly, then, the trial court would have abused its discretion had it lifted its earlier order staying Jarreau\u2019s state court proceeding.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> In sum, not only was the district court\u2019s decision to deny Jarreau\u2019s motion to lift the stay entirely proper, it was required by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">B. Jaeeeau\u2019s Injury: Medical Causation</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">Jarreau argues that the district court\u2019s exoneration of both PATCO and JWT from liability for Jarreau\u2019s injury must be reversed. He urges that court made errors of fact and law. \u201cWe independently review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law. We may reverse its findings of fact, however, only if we determine that they were clearly erroneous.\u201d <footnotemark>18</footnotemark> We consider whether Jarreau proved that the collision caused his back injury, entitling him to receive compensation from the concursus.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">A limitation proceeding generally comprises a two-step process,<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> the first being \u201cthe establishment of liability of the shipowner to the claimant, as to which the claimant (or libellant) bears the burden.\u201d<footnotemark>20</footnotemark> \u201cThe whole doctrine of limitations of liability presupposes that a liability exists which is to be limited. If no liability exists there is nothing to limit.\u201d<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> Thus Jarreau was required initially to prove facts supporting his claim that PATCO was liable to him for his alleged injury.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">The trial court concluded that PAT-CO was entitled to exoneration from liability to Jarreau because he failed to prove that the collision played any part, however small, in causing his injury. Jarreau challenges that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"318\">*318</page-number>finding. We review the court\u2019s finding for clear error.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b384-4\">In eases involving issues of medical causation, it is not the function of a court to search the record for conflicting circumstantial evidence which supports alternative theories of causation.<footnotemark>24</footnotemark> Jarreau presented his own live testimony and the deposition of his treating physician, Dr. Jackson. Jarreau testified that he had no prior back problems and that his back started hurting either immediately or shortly after the collision occurred. Jarreau\u2019s expert, Dr. Jackson, stated that Jarreau does suffer from a back injury, but he (Dr. Jackson) could not tell if the injury resulted from the collision.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">PATCO and JWT also presented an expert witness, Dr. Landry, who had personally examined Jarreau and reviewed x-rays of Jar-reau\u2019s back that were taken only one month after the accident. The x-rays satisfied Dr. Landry that Jarreau had a degenerative disc disease and that the disease was caused by trauma. But Dr. Landry was also convinced that the trauma and the condition it caused predated the collision. Thus there was expert testimony that the collision did not cause Jarreau\u2019s condition but no such testimony that it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">The district court observed that \u201cthere is no objective evidence to aid the doctors in determining whether Jarreau, in fact, was injured in the accident at issue.\u201d Thus, stated the court, the answer to the question whether Jarreau was injured as a result of the collision \u201cis totally dependent] upon Jar-reau\u2019s credibility when he says he had no prior back problems but had an onset of pain either immediately or shortly after the accident.\u201d Continuing, the court noted that two crew members of the MTV MISS CAROLYN testified that immediately after the accident Jarreau told them that he was not injured; and, within a week after the accident Jarreau himself gave a statement in which he denied having been injured in the collision. Based on Jarreau\u2019s conflicting statements and his manner and demeanor on the stand, the court expressly concluded that Jarreau\u2019s testimony regarding his injury was not credible. The court found as a matter of fact that the collision played no part whatsoever in injuring Jarreau.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-10\">As the trial court noted, the record contains no extrinsic, objective evidence proving precisely when or how Jarreau was injured. The court thus was faced with two equally plausible but diametrically opposed possibilities: Jarreau was injured in the collision or he was not. Based largely on its assessment of Jarreau\u2019s credibility, the district court found that Jarreau was not injured in the accident. Under the totality of the evidence, we cannot say that this was clear error, particularly when reviewing this finding under the highly deferential standard applicable to credibility calls by the trier of facts.<footnotemark>25</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b384-11\">\u201cWeighing conflicting evidence and inferences and determining the relative credibility of witnesses to resolve factual disputes is the [factfinder\u2019s] province.\u201d<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> \u201cIts decisions must be accepted if the record contains \u2018competent and substantial evidence fairly tending to support the verdict ... even if different inferences and conclusions also might be supported by the evidence.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>27</footnotemark> In fact, the Supreme Court has admonished that \u201cwhen a trial judge\u2019s finding is based on his decision to credit the testimony of one of two or more witnesses, each of whom has told a coherent and facially plausible story that is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"319\">*319</page-number>not contradicted by extrinsic evidence, that finding, if not internally inconsistent, can virtually never be clear error.\u201d<footnotemark>28</footnotemark> That is why we previously have written that if \u201c[t]he district court\u2019s finding is based in part on its assessment of the credibility of the witness[ ], we will not depart from such an assessment except in the very rarest of circumstances.\u201d<footnotemark>29</footnotemark> This case presents no such circumstances.<footnotemark>30</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">Jarreau appeals an evidentiary ruling of the district court that excluded evidence of medical records. Jarreau raises this issue in his opening brief, but he fails to make the argument. A question posed for appellate review but not argued in the opening brief is waived.<footnotemark>31</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">The district court did not err in denying Jarreau\u2019s motion to lift its order staying his state court proceeding. Furthermore, the district court did not err in ruling that both shipowners were entitled to exoneration from liability for Jarreau\u2019s injury based on its finding that Jarreau failed to prove that the collision caused his injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b380-11\">. 46 U.S.C. app. \u00a7\u00a7 181-189 (1988).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b380-12\">.
