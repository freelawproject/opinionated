[making] any threat to take the life of or to inflict bodily harm upon the President of the United States ....\u201d<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> The incident <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>which led to petitioner\u2019s arrest occurred on August 27, 1966, during a public rally on the Washington Monument grounds. The crowd present broke up into small discussion groups and petitioner joined a gathering scheduled to discuss police brutality. Most of those in the group were quite young, either in their teens or early twenties. Petitioner, who himself was 18 years old, entered into the discussion after one member of the group suggested that the young people present should get more education before expressing their views. According to an investigator for the Army Counter Intelligence Corps who was present, petitioner responded: \u201cThey always holler at us to get an education. And now I have already received my draft classification as 1-A and I have got to report for my physical this Monday coming. I am not going. If they ever make me carry a rifle the first man I want to get in my sights is L. B. J.\u201d \u201cThey are not going to make me kill my black brothers.\u201d On the basis of this statement, the jury found that petitioner had committed a felony by knowingly and willfully threatening the President. The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed by a two-to-one vote. 131 U. S. App. D. C. 125, 402 F. 2d 676 (1968). We reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b780-5\">At the close of the Government\u2019s case, petitioner\u2019s trial counsel moved for a judgment of acquittal. He contended that there was \u201cabsolutely no evidence on the basis of which the jury would be entitled to find that [petitioner] made a threat against the life of the Presi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"707\">*707</page-number>dent.\u201d He stressed the fact that petitioner\u2019s statement was made during a political debate, that it was expressly made conditional upon an event \u2014 induction into the Armed Forces \u2014 which petitioner, vowed would never occur, and that both petitioner and the crowd laughed after the statement was made. He concluded, \u201cNow actually what happened here in all this was a kind of very crude offensive method of stating a political opposition to the President. What he was saying, he says, I don\u2019t want to shoot black people because I don\u2019t consider them my enemy, and if they put a rifle in my hand it is the people that put the rifle in my hand, as symbolized by the President, who are my real enemy.\u201d We hold that the trial judge erred in denying this motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-5\">Certainly the statute under which petitioner was convicted is constitutional on its face. The Nation undoubtedly has a valid, even an overwhelming, interest in protecting the safety of its Chief Executive and in allowing him to perform his duties without interference from threats of physical violence. See H. R. Rep. No. 652, 64th Cong., 1st Sess. (1916). Nevertheless, a statute such as this one, which makes criminal a form of pure speech, must be interpreted with the commands of the First Amendment clearly in mind. What is a threat must be distinguished from what is constitutionally protected speech.</p>\n<p id=\"b781-6\">The judges in the Court of Appeals differed over whether or not the \u201cwillfullness\u201d requirement of the statute implied that a defendant must have intended to carry out his \u201cthreat.\u201d Some early cases found the will-fullness requirement met if the speaker voluntarily uttered the charged words with \u201can <em>apparent </em>determination to carry them into execution.\u201d <em>Ragansky </em>v. <em>United States, </em>253 F. 643, 645 (C. A. 7th Cir. 1918) (emphasis supplied); cf. <em>Pierce </em>v. <em>United States, </em>365 F. 2d 292 (C. A. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"708\">*708</page-number>10th Cir. 1966). The majority below seemed to agree. Perhaps this interpretation is correct, although we have grave doubts about it. See the dissenting opinion below, 131 U. S. App. D. C., at 135-142, 402 F. 2d, at 686-693 (Wright, J.). But whatever the \u201cwillfullness\u201d requirement implies, the statute initially requires the Government to prove a true \u201cthreat.\u201d We do not believe that the kind of political hyperbole indulged in by petitioner fits within that statutory term. For we must interpret the language Congress chose \u201cagainst the background of a profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open, and that it may well include vehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials.\u201d <em>New York Times Co. </em>v. <em>Sullivan, </em>376 U. S. 254, 270 (1964). The language of the political arena, like the language used in labor disputes, see <em>Linn </em>v. <em>United Plant Guard Workers of America, </em>383 U. S. 53, 58 (1966), is often vituperative, abusive, and inexact. We agree with petitioner that his only offense here was \u201ca kind of very crude offensive method of stating a political opposition to the President.\u201d Taken in context, and regarding the expressly conditional nature of the statement and the reaction of the listeners, we do not see how it could be interpreted otherwise.</p>\n<p id=\"b782-6\">The motion for leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis </em>and the petition for a writ of certiorari are granted and the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.

L. Rev. 724, 725 (1919). It is said that one Walter Walker, a 15th century keeper of an inn known as the \u201cCrown,\u201d was convicted under the Statute of Treasons for telling his son: \u201cTom, if thou behavest thyself well, I will make thee heir to the Crown.\u201d He was found guilty of compassing and imagining the death of the King, hanged, drawn, and quartered. 1 J. Campbell, Lives of the Chief Justices of England 151 (1873).</p>\n<p id=\"b783-7\">In the time of Edward IV, one Thomas Burdet who predicted that the king would \u201csoon die, with a view to alienate the affections\u201d of the people was indicted for \u201ccompassing and imagining of the death of the King,\u201d 79 Eng. Rep. 706 (1477) \u2014 the crime of constructive treason<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> with which the old reports are filled.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>In the time of Charles II, one Edward Brownlow was indicted \u201cfor speaking these words, that he wished all the gentry in the land would kill one another, so that the comminalty might live the better.\u201d 3 Middlesex County Rec. 326 (1888). In the same year (1662) one Robert Thornell was indicted for saying \u201cthat if the Kinge did side with the Bishops, the divell take Kinge and the Bishops too.\u201d <em>Id., </em>at 327.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-6\">While our Alien and Sedition Laws were in force, John Adams, President of the United States, en route from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Quincy, Massachusetts, stopped in Newark, New Jersey, where he was greeted by a crowd and by a committee that saluted him by firing a cannon.</p>\n<p id=\"b784-7\">A bystander said, \u201cThere goes the President and they are firing at his ass.\u201d Luther Baldwin was indicted for replying that he did not care \u201cif they fired through his ass.\u201d He was convicted in the federal court for speaking \u201csedicious words tending to defame the President and Government of the United States\u201d and fined, assessed court costs and expenses, and committed to jail until the fine and fees were paid. See J. Smith, Freedom\u2019s Fetters 270-274 (1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b784-8\">The Alien and Sedition Laws constituted one of our sorriest chapters; and I had thought we had done with them forever.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b785-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>Yet the present statute has hardly fared better. \u201cLike the Statute of Treasons, section 871 was passed in a 'relatively calm peacetime spring/ but has been construed under circumstances when intolerance for free speech was much greater than it normally might be.\u201d Note, Threatening the President: Protected Dissenter or Political Assassin, 57 Geo. L. J. 553, 570 (1969). Convictions under 18 U. S. C. \u00a7 871 have been sustained for displaying posters urging passersby to \u201chang [President] Roosevelt.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Apel, </em>44 F. Supp. 592, 593 (D. C. N. D. Ill. 1942); for declaring that \u201cPresident Wilson ought to be killed. It is a wonder some one has not done it already.

Ohio 1917); for declaring that \u201cWilson is a wooden-headed son of a bitch. I wish Wilson was in hell, and if I had the power I would put him there,\u201d <em>Clark </em>v. <em>United States, </em>250 F. 449 (C. A. 5th Cir. 1918). In sustaining an indictment under the statute against a man who indicated that he would enjoy shooting President Wilson if he had the chance, the trial court explained the thrust of \u00a7 871:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b785-5\">\u201cThe purpose of the statute was undoubtedly, not only the protection of the President, but also the prohibition of just such statements as those alleged in this indictment. The expression of such direful intentions and desires, not only indicates a spirit of disloyalty to the nation bordering upon treason, but is, in a very real sense, a menace to the peace and safety of the country. ... It arouses resentment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"712\">*712</page-number>and concern on the part of patriotic citizens.\u201d <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jasick, </em>252 F. 931, 933 (D. C. E. D. Mich. 1918).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b786-6\">Suppression of speech as an effective police measure is an old, old device, outlawed by our Constitution.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b783-8\"> The prosecution in those cases laid bare to the juries that the treasonous thoughts were the heart of the matter; \u201cthe original of his Treasons proceeded from the imagination of his heart; which imagination was in itself High-Treason, albeit the same proceeded not to any overt fact: and the heart being possessed with the abundance of his traitorous imagination, and not being able so to contain itself, burst forth in vile and traitorous Speeches, and from thence to horrible and heinous actions.\u201d <em>Trial of Sir John Perrot, </em>1 How. St. Tr. 1315, 1318 (1592). \u201c[T]he high treason charged, is the compassing or imagining (in other words, the intending or designing) the death of the king; I mean his NATURAL DEATH; which being a hidden operation of the mind, an overt act is any thing which legally proves the existence of such traitorous design and intention \u2014 I say that the design against the king\u2019s natural life, is the high treason under the first branch of the statute; and whatever is evidence, which may be legally laid before a jury to judge of the traitorous intention, is a legal overt act; because an overt act is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"710\">*710</page-number>nothing but legal evidence embodied upon the record.\u201d <em>Trial of Thomas Hardy, </em>24 How.

Likewise, judges and juries, in their willingness to presume evil intent on the part of Republican writers, largely nullified the safeguards erected by the Sedition Act itself. Criticism of the President and Congress \u2014 in which every American indulges as his birthright \u2014 was severely punished; yet this practice <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"711\">*711</page-number>manifestly has only a remote tendency to injure and bring into contempt the government of the United States. In short, much that has become commonplace in American political life was put under the ban by the Federalist lawmakers and judges of 1798.\u201d J.
