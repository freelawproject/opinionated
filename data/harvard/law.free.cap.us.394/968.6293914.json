But the Army denied relief. Petitioner then appealed to the Army Board for Correction of Military Records, which denied relief.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-10\">Meanwhile petitioner filed a petition for habeas corpus in the Federal District Court (D. C. N. D. Calif.) asking <em>inter alia </em>for a stay of his shipment overseas pending disposition of his claim before the Army Board. The District Court denied relief and petitioner appealed to the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-11\">On April 7, 1969, petitioner asked me as Circuit Justice to stay his shipment overseas, pending disposition of his appeal by the Court of Appeals. The application reached me at 7:30 p. m., April 7. The shipment of petitioner overseas was scheduled for April 8, 1969, at 10 a. m. (E. S. T.). So I issued the stay about 8:15 p. m., April 7. My stay ran through April 18, and was issued so that the Conference could pass on the questions which seemed to me to be substantial.</p>\n<p id=\"b994-12\">Federal courts do not intervene on the merits pending exhaustion of military administrative remedies. <em>Gusik </em>v. <em>Schilder, </em>340 U. S. 128. But the question is whether the federal courts have any oversight over members of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"969\">*969</page-number>the Armed Forces when they are seeking to exhaust their military administrative remedies. Moreover, when military administrative remedies are exhausted, can a federal court maintain the <em>status quo </em>while it determines the merits? That is to say, can a federal court \u201cin aid of\u201d its jurisdiction, 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1651, keep a member of the Armed Services from being spirited out of the country? Some lower courts have granted interim relief pending exhaustion of military administrative remedies. <em>Schwartz </em>v. <em>Covington, </em>341 F. 2d 537. Cf. <em>Nelson </em>v. <em>Miller, </em>373 F. 2d 474.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-5\">Army Regulation 15-185, \u00a7 III, par. 9 (Jan. 8, 1962), provides: \u201cThe application to the Board for correction of a record will not operate as a stay of any proceedings being taken with respect to the person involved.\u201d While that gives the Army a directive, it is of no significance in resolving the \u201cin aid of\u201d question under 28 U. S. C. \u00a7 1651.</p>\n<p id=\"b995-6\">This question is, in my mind, so substantial that it warrants issuance of the stay.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
