In his charge to the jury, the trial judge simply read the regulation under which petitioners were charged, without defining or limiting any of the terms contained therein. There was no objection to the charge. On appeal, petitioners challenged the sufficiency of the evidence. Petitioners raise several challenges to the validity of their convictions in their petition before this Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b978-8\">The Government, without conceding the more extreme of petitioners\u2019 arguments, does not oppose granting the writ and reversing the judgments of conviction on the ground that the minimal instructions given the jury make it \u201cquite possible that the present convictions rest upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"953\">*953</page-number>an unacceptably broad reading of the regulation,\u201d and that such a defect can be noticed by this Court even though no objection was made to the instruction in the trial court.
