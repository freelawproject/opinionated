Brown, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A2O\">concurring. I join the majority in denying the request for rehearing by appellant John Bednar and his supporting <em>amici. </em>Appellant was granted the relief he sought by this court\u2019s judgment, and thus has no standing to move for a rehearing. The <em>amici, </em>of course, have no more standing to move for rehearing than they do to file a notice of appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b159-18\">Having said that, I would observe that the law as announced in paragraph one of the syllabus is (in my opinion) dictum. The issue considered in syllabus one was addressed, perhaps mistakenly when viewed in retrospect, because counsel for the Industrial Commission and counsel for the <em>amici </em>sought a ruling on the issue in their briefs and in their oral arguments.</p>\n<judges id=\"b159-19\">Re snick, J., concurs in the foregoing concurring opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b159-20\">Douglas, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A6q\">dissenting. In my judgment, rehearing should be granted and a new opinion should issue eliminating any discussion or holding with regard to issues not properly before us. Accordingly, I adhere to the views expressed in my concurring and dissenting opinion, following the majority\u2019s original decision. See <em>State, ex rel. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., </em>v. <em>Indus. Comm. </em>(1990), 52 Ohio St. 3d 144, 150-152, 556 N.E. 2d 467, 473-474.</p>\n<judges id=\"b159-21\">Sweeney, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
