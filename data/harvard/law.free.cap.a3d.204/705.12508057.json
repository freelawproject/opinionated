The plaintiffs claim that their revised complaint alleged facts sufficient to support the conclusion that the defendants engaged in extreme and outrageous conduct toward them. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are pertinent to our decision. The original complaint was brought by John Strano on his own behalf and as the father and next friend of his minor son. The plaintiffs alleged, in relevant part, that the minor\n   plaintiff, a scout\n   in the Essex Boy Scouts Troop 12, had been bullied by a fellow scout. After John Strano requested that Azzinaro and other adult troop leaders intervene to stop the bullying and John Strano attended troop meetings to monitor his son's treatment, Azzinaro sent John Strano a letter notifying him that the minor plaintiff was no longer permitted to attend troop meetings or events, because John Strano's presence at troop meetings disrupted the group's functioning.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The defendants filed a motion to strike the complaint on the ground that the plaintiffs failed to allege facts sufficient to establish that the defendants had engaged in extreme and outrageous conduct. The court granted the motion to strike, concluding that no reasonable fact finder could find that the defendants' conduct was extreme and outrageous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The plaintiffs filed a revised complaint, in which they pleaded additional facts in support of their claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress. The revised complaint added that the minor plaintiff had been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, which diagnosis qualified him for an Individual Education Plan pursuant to Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=29%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%20794\">\n    29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794\n   </extracted-citation>\n   et seq., and that the defendants were aware that the minor plaintiff required educational accommodations. The revised complaint also described several instances in which a fellow scout had bullied the minor plaintiff, as well as remedial actions that the alleged bully's parents and the defendants had taken in response to the bullying.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The defendants filed a motion to strike the plaintiffs' revised complaint on the ground that it, like the original complaint, failed to plead facts sufficient to allege that the defendants had engaged in extreme and outrageous\n   conduct toward them. The court granted the defendants' motion. The plaintiffs did not file a new pleading within the time allotted in Practice Book \u00a7 10-44. The defendants filed a motion for judgment, which the court granted. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The plaintiffs claim that the court erroneously determined that no reasonable fact finder could find that the defendants' alleged conduct had been extreme and outrageous and, therefore, erred in striking their revised complaint. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"The standard of review for granting a motion to strike is well settled. In an appeal from a judgment following the granting of a motion to strike, we must take as true the facts alleged in the plaintiff's complaint and must construe the complaint in the manner most favorable to sustaining its legal sufficiency.... A motion to strike admits all facts well pleaded.... A determination regarding the legal sufficiency of a claim is, therefore, a conclusion of law, not a finding of fact. Accordingly, our review is plenary.... If facts provable in the complaint would support a cause of action, the motion to strike must be denied....

The plaintiffs alleged that John Strano asked the defendants to intervene to protect the minor plaintiff from bullying. Subsequently, Azzinaro sent a letter to John Strano expelling the minor plaintiff from the troop. Azzinaro allegedly stated that John Strano's presence \"at troop meetings [was] a major disruption to the other scouts, scout parents, Rider and leaders of the troop.\" The plaintiffs alleged that this statement was false and that the defendants punished the minor plaintiff \"for the purpose of causing pain and injury to John Strano.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   He alleged, in essence, that the defendants inflicted emotional distress on him by expelling his son, and that the expulsion was effected for the purpose of inflicting distress on John Strano. This conduct is not different in kind or degree from that alleged in cases such as\n   <em>\n    Appleton\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Board of Education\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1116849\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/254/205/#p211\">\n    254 Conn. at 205\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=757%20A.2d%201059\">\n    757 A.2d 1059\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , and\n   <em>\n    Dollard\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Board of Education\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"124075\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/63/550/\">\n    63 Conn.

Even if hurtful, the conduct did not exceed all bounds of decency in civilized society. We, therefore, affirm the trial court's judgment as to John Strano.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Our analysis of the minor plaintiff's claim is modified by two factors that do not apply to the claim of John\n   Strano. The Restatement provides that conduct may be deemed extreme and outrageous if the actor knew that \"the other person was especially vulnerable.\" 2 Restatement (Third), supra, \u00a7 46, comment (d). The Restatement also provides: \"Whether an actor's conduct is extreme and outrageous depends on the facts of each case, including the relationship of the parties, [and] whether the actor abused a position of authority over the other person ....\" Id., comment (d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The complaint alleged facts sufficient to trigger consideration of the additional factors. The plaintiffs alleged that the minor plaintiff exhibited neuroatypical behaviors associated with his autism spectrum diagnosis, and that the defendants knew that the minor plaintiff required speech and language services at school to address deficits in social skills and executive functioning. They further alleged several instances in which the minor plaintiff was bullied by a fellow scout while participating in troop activities. Although the defendants notified the other scout's parents of these instances and suspended the fellow scout from meetings\n   for four weeks, they refused to take any further-and, impliedly, more harsh-disciplinary action against the bully. The revised complaint asserts, as well, that the defendants had a duty to protect troop members from bullying and sets forth facts sufficient to conclude that the defendants were in a position of authority over the minor plaintiff. Thus, vulnerability on the part of the minor plaintiff and the position of authority on the part of the defendants were alleged.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The allegation of additional factors, however, does not necessarily compel the conclusion that the element of extreme and outrageous conduct has been adequately alleged. There remains the dispositive question as to whether under the circumstances, which include vulnerability and the exercise of authority, the alleged conduct was extreme and outrageous, as defined and\n   illustrated in case law. We turn, then, to illustrative cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Karlen\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Westport Board of Education\n   </em>\n   , Docket No. 3:07-CV-309 (CFD),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%203925961\">\n    2010 WL 3925961\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. Conn. September 30, 2010), the plaintiff alleged that the defendant failed to act to mitigate racially motivated harassment of a minor student. The court noted that in response to the plaintiff's reporting that she was the victim of racially motivated harassment, the defendant investigated her allegations, met with her parents, and promptly honored her father's request to transfer the plaintiff to another school. Id., at *18. In light of such actions, the District Court, applying Connecticut law, concluded that summary judgment was appropriate because \"the plaintiffs have not alleged conduct that is sufficiently 'extreme and outrageous' to constitute intentional infliction of emotional distress.\" Id.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   It is instructive to note a qualitative difference between\n   <em>\n    Bell\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Karlen\n   </em>\n   . In\n   <em>\n    Karlen\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Westport Board of Education\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2010%20WL%203925961\">\n    2010 WL 3925961\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , the defendant superintendent allegedly made an effort to address the hurtful behavior complained of, though the effort may have been unproductive. In\n   <em>\n    Bell\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Board of Education\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"248961\" index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/55/400/#p404\">\n    55 Conn.

Conn. March 29, 2018) (although plaintiff allegedly had learning disorder and allegedly had been called \" 'like a fifth grader,' 'not too swift,' 'slow,' and 'stupid' \" by instructor, expulsion from professional training school after telling prospective students about instances in which she was criticized, demeaned, and unfairly treated by instructor was not basis for intentional infliction of emotional distress claim, as such conduct did not transgress all bounds of decency).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   With these principles in mind, we turn to the precise allegations of the minor plaintiff. As stated previously, the revised complaint alleged that the minor plaintiff was autistic and that the defendants knew that he required speech and language services at school to address deficits in his executive ability and social skills. The revised complaint alleged that he had been bullied\n   several times, most notably by a particular fellow scout. The defendants suspended the bully for four weeks but did not take further action against him. The defendants then expelled the minor plaintiff for the stated reason that the presence of his father, the plaintiff John Strano, at troop activities was \"a major disruption to the other scouts, scout parents, [the minor plaintiff] and leaders of the troop.\" The stated reason was false, according to the revised complaint, as John Strano had asked the defendants to intervene to protect the minor plaintiff from bullying, and it was the defendants' obligation to do so.\n   The revised complaint concluded by alleging that the defendants punished the minor plaintiff for the actions of his father in order to cause John Strano pain and injury, and, as a result of the conduct of the defendants, both of the plaintiffs suffered extreme emotional distress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   It is instructive to note what was not alleged. It was not alleged that the minor plaintiff was expelled because he was autistic, nor was it alleged that the defendants promoted bullying and the minor plaintiff suffered distress as a result. Nor were the mechanics of the expulsion allegedly abusive or degrading. Rather, it allegedly was the expulsion itself, for an allegedly false reason\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   based on the minor plaintiff's behavior or character, that caused him extreme emotional distress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   In these circumstances, we conclude that the expulsion in itself was not sufficient to constitute extreme and outrageous conduct for purposes of a claim sounding in intentional infliction of emotional distress. In so concluding, we are mindful of the minor plaintiff's alleged vulnerability. We recognize that troop participation may have been a valuable opportunity for the minor plaintiff to interact positively with others, and that being terminated from participation in that activity may have caused him distress. Although efforts by the defendants\n   allegedly were inadequate to end the bullying, we are not persuaded that, in light of the previously discussed authorities, their alleged conduct toward the minor plaintiff was extreme and outrageous, beyond all bounds of civilized behavior.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Additionally, the manner in which the minor plaintiff was expelled does not rise to the level of intentional infliction of emotional distress. The revised complaint does not allege that the defendants used any harsh or humiliating language in the letter or, for that matter, at any time. Even if the defendants' given reason for the expulsion was untrue, the scenario does not exceed the bounds of civilized behavior.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The allegations in the present case present a scenario that may well have been difficult, and the plaintiffs perhaps may have been treated unfairly. Allegedly uneven discipline and punishment for a parent's actions are a far cry from the two years of an intensely fearful environment such as was presented in\n   <em>\n    Bell\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Board of Education\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"248961\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/55/400/#p404\">\n    55 Conn.

The circumstances of this case are consistent with the scenarios in those cases that present unfortunate, but not totally uncivilized, behavior.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-42\">\n    In their brief, the defendants claimed that the Federal Volunteer Protection Act,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%2014503\">\n     42 U.S.C. \u00a7 14503\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (a), barred recovery.
