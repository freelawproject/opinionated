(Bank of America), appeals from the judgment of the trial court opening the supplemental judgment that had been rendered in its favor and, thereafter, rendering a supplemental judgment in favor of the defendant Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (Wells Fargo), in the amount of $ 348,097.16.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On appeal, Bank of America claims that the court erred in granting Wells Fargo's motion to open the supplemental judgment more than four months after it was rendered on the basis of fraud committed by a homeowner in securing multiple mortgages years before this action to foreclose a blight lien commenced. We agree that the court erred and reverse the judgment of the trial court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts, as found by the trial court or as stipulated to by the parties,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and procedural history are relevant to this appeal. On October 29, 2007, the defendant Ismat Rahman acquired title to property located at 150 Doolittle Road in Stamford for a purchase price of $ 780,000. He executed a promissory note in favor of World Savings Bank, in the principal amount of $ 624,000. To secure the note, Rahman executed a mortgage in favor of World Savings Bank (Wells Fargo mortgage),\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   which was recorded in the Stamford land records in volume 9187 at page 347.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Approximately six months later, on April 8, 2008, Rahman executed a promissory note in favor of Countrywide Home Loans Servicing, LP, in the principal amount of $ 417,000, which note was secured with a mortgage on the property (Bank of America mortgage).\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Bank of America mortgage was recorded in volume 9318 at page 259 of the Stamford land records. Less than one month later, on May 2, 2008, Rahman executed a promissory note in favor of Washington Mutual Bank in the principal amount of $ 500,000, which note was secured with a mortgage on the property (JPMorgan Chase mortgage).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The JPMorgan Chase mortgage was recorded in volume 9346 at page 260 of the Stamford land records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At the closing of the Bank of America mortgage, Rahman presented a document titled \"Satisfaction of Mortgage\" purportedly executed by Mortgage Electronic Registrations System, Inc., as nominee for World Savings Bank (satisfaction). The satisfaction was fraudulent and was never recorded on the Stamford land\n   records. Rahman also presented the satisfaction at the closing of the JPMorgan Chase mortgage.\n   The defendant JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, filed a claim against its title insurance policy issued by the defendant Chicago Title Insurance Company, now known as Fidelity National Title Group, arising out of Rahman's presentation of the fraudulent satisfaction at the time of acquiring the JPMorgan Chase mortgage. Chicago Title Insurance Company, in turn, instituted a fraud action against Rahman and, on March 17, 2011, obtained judgment in its favor in the amount of $ 627,730.67 plus 6 percent per annum postjudgment interest. See\n   <em>\n    Chicago Title Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Rahman\n   </em>\n   , Superior Court, judicial district of Stamford-Norwalk, Docket No. CV-10-5013365-S (March 17, 2011). A judgment lien was recorded in the Stamford land records at volume 10193 at page 257 as to the property. Bank of America was neither a party to, nor had any knowledge of, the fraud action against Rahman.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Prior to this foreclosure action, three other foreclosure actions were commenced with respect to the property. The first was commenced on November 4, 2008, by Wells Fargo's predecessor, which withdrew the action on March 4, 2010. See\n   <em>\n    Wachovia Mortgage, FSB\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Rahman\n   </em>\n   , Superior Court, judicial district of Stamford-Norwalk, Docket No. CV-08-5009298-S. The second was commenced on January 13, 2009, by JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association, and was dismissed by the court on October 8, 2010, pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 14-3, governing dismissal for lack of diligence. See\n   <em>\n    JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Assn.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Rahman\n   </em>\n   , Superior Court, judicial district of Stamford-Norwalk, Docket No. CV-09-5010015-S (October 8, 2010). Wells Fargo's predecessor also commenced a third foreclosure action in 2009. Bank of America appeared in that action and filed an answer and special defense, dated\n   May 5, 2010, based on the satisfaction, which it attached to its pleading.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On August 14, 2012, the plaintiff commenced the present action by way of a one count complaint seeking foreclosure of a blight lien held by the plaintiff and recorded in the Stamford land records. The complaint also named other defendants, including Wells Fargo, and alleged that these defendants may claim an interest in the property. See footnote 1 of this opinion. On October 23, 2012, the plaintiff filed a motion for default against Wells Fargo for failure to appear, which was granted by the clerk of the court on November 7, 2012. On February 19, 2013, the court rendered judgment of foreclosure by sale. The court found the total debt and attorney's fees due the plaintiff to be $ 28,618.75 and the fair market value of the property to be $ 410,000. The court set a sale date for May 4, 2013, and the property was sold for $ 400,000. On July 29, 2013, the plaintiff filed a motion for determination of priorities and supplemental judgment and subsequently filed a revised motion, which the court granted.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   The remaining proceeds from the sale, in the amount of $ 348,097.16, were paid to the clerk of the court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On February 6, 2014, Bank of America filed a motion for a supplemental judgment in which it claimed that the amount owed to it exceeded the remaining sale proceeds. It therefore requested a supplemental judgment disbursing the remaining sale proceeds to it. Bank of America argued that Wells Fargo had been defaulted\n   for failure to appear and had not filed an affidavit of debt by which the court could determine what, if any, amount remained owed to Wells Fargo. It further argued that Wells Fargo had commenced a prior foreclosure proceeding, in which Bank of America appeared and asserted a special defense, that Wells Fargo had received payment in full and that the Wells Fargo mortgage had been released by the satisfaction. Bank of America argued that after it filed a request for production seeking documents related to payment and release of the Wells Fargo mortgage, Wells Fargo withdrew its prior foreclosure complaint without having produced any such documents.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The court rejected Bank of America's motion for a supplemental judgment, stating that it needed \"verification of release of the Wells Fargo mortgage that was filed on the land records prior to [the Bank of America mortgage].\" On April 1, 2014, Bank of America filed a motion for reconsideration, in which it acknowledged that the satisfaction was never recorded on the land records. It argued, however, that in the event the court were to deny Bank of America's motion, \"the net proceeds from the sale of this property will be held indefinitely by the court, without any indication that any money is still owed under the Wells Fargo mortgage.\" On April 17, 2014, the court reconsidered its decision and granted Bank of America's motion for a supplemental judgment, ordering the clerk of the court, following the expiration of the twenty day appeal period, to disburse to Bank of America $ 348,097.16, the amount of the sale proceeds remaining with the clerk.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   <em>\n    More than three years later\n   </em>\n   , on June 2, 2017, counsel for Wells Fargo filed an appearance and a motion to open the supplemental judgment, arguing that the judgment had been procured by fraud or mutual mistake. Wells Fargo contended that Rahman's fraud in forging the satisfaction provided the court with authority to\n   open the judgment after the four month period set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 52-212a. Wells Fargo did not contend that Bank of America, itself, had engaged in fraud but, rather, claimed that Bank of America had \"unknowingly perpetuated [Rahman's] conduct when seeking the supplemental judgment.\" Wells Fargo requested that the supplemental judgment be opened and the remaining proceeds from the foreclosure sale be paid to Wells Fargo. Bank of America filed an objection, in which it argued, inter alia, that the supplemental judgment had not been procured by fraud because the court had been made aware that the satisfaction was never recorded and, thus, that Wells Fargo's mortgage had not been released from the land records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On August 30, 2017, Bank of America and Wells Fargo appeared before the court for a hearing on the motion to open.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The parties subsequently submitted supplemental briefing concerning the legal standard applicable to a motion to open a judgment on the basis of fraud.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   On September 22, 2017, the court issued a memorandum\n   of decision in which it granted Wells Fargo's motion to open the supplemental judgment and its motion for a supplemental judgment.\n   The court first found that Wells Fargo sufficiently had established fraud to invoke the exception to the four month limitation on opening or setting aside a judgment pursuant to \u00a7 52-212a. Applying the factors set forth in\n   <em>\n    Varley\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Varley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1951444\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/180/1/#p3\">\n    180 Conn. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 3-4,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=428%20A.2d%20317\">\n    428 A.2d 317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1980) ; see footnote 10 of this opinion; the court found that there was no laches or unreasonable delay on the part of Wells Fargo. The court stated: \"Due to the massive and continuing fraud perpetrated on three separate banks, that had the banks scrambling to protect their own interests, it is understandable to this court that considerable delay and confusion presented itself before [Wells Fargo] had a full understanding of all the facts.\" It further concluded that there was no indication of prejudice to Bank of America as a result of the delay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Turning to the second\n   <em>\n    Varley\n   </em>\n   factor of diligence in trying to discover the fraud, the court found that Wells Fargo, as the holder of the first mortgage on the property, had no reason to be aware of the recordation of any mortgages executed and recorded thereafter. It further concluded that Wells Fargo, having been defaulted for failure to appear, had not received notice of the motion for a supplemental judgment or the motion for reconsideration. Concluding that \"[t]he supplemental judgment is a separate statutory proceeding and equity requires notice to all encumbrancers even if defaulted in the first part of the foreclosure action,\" the court determined that the \"failure of notice itself should open the judgment.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The court then found that Wells Fargo had established the third and fourth\n   <em>\n    Varley\n   </em>\n   factors. As to the third factor of clear proof of the fraud, the court found that Rahman's presentation of the forged satisfaction at the time of the closing of the Bank of America and JPMorgan Chase mortgages, which was confirmed by the civil judgment obtained by Chicago Title Insurance\n   Company, satisfied this factor. Lastly, as to the fourth factor, the court determined that the Wells Fargo mortgage was first in time and, therefore, had priority over the Bank of America mortgage, such that there was a substantial likelihood that the result of a new trial would be different. Having concluded that Wells Fargo established all four\n   <em>\n    Varley\n   </em>\n   factors, the court granted its motion to open the supplement judgment. The court then granted Wells Fargo's motion for a supplemental judgment and ordered Bank of America to pay $ 348,097.16 to the clerk of the court and further ordered the clerk of the court to pay that sum to Wells Fargo. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   We first set forth the applicable legal principles. Section 52-212a provides in relevant part: \"Unless otherwise provided by law and except in such cases in which the court has continuing jurisdiction, a civil\n   judgment or decree rendered in the Superior Court may not be opened or set aside unless a motion to open or set aside is filed within four months following the date on which it was rendered or passed....\" \"Courts have interpreted the phrase, [u]nless otherwise provided by law, as preserving the common-law authority of a court to open a judgment after the four month period.... It is well established that [c]ourts have intrinsic powers, independent of statutory provisions authorizing the opening of judgments, to vacate [or open] any judgment obtained by fraud, duress or mutual mistake.\" (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Simmons\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Weiss\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12490794\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/168/617/#p99\">\n    176 Conn.

Citing\n   <em>\n    Varley\n   </em>\n   , the court held that \"the\n   defendant clearly had not exercised the requisite diligence in uncovering the purported malfeasance.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=952%20A.2d%201\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   In the present case, we are convinced that the trial court's finding that Wells Fargo had proven diligence is clearly erroneous. The court's determination improperly was supported by its finding that Wells Fargo, as the holder of the first mortgage on the property, had no reason to be aware of the recordation of any mortgages executed and recorded thereafter. The fraud of which Wells Fargo complained occurred in April and May, 2008, when Rahman, in what the trial court described as \"blatant acts of forgery,\" presented the fraudulent satisfaction to two lenders in an effort to obtain multiple mortgages on the property. More than nine years later, on June 2, 2017, Wells Fargo filed a motion to open the supplemental judgment in this action. During that nine year period, Wells Fargo itself was in the best position to discover Rahman's fraud but failed to exercise any diligence in attempting to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In fact, the trial court took judicial notice of not one, but two foreclosure actions instituted by Wells Fargo or its predecessor with respect to the property. In the second foreclosure action, commenced in October, 2009, Bank of America's predecessor had filed a special defense alleging that the Wells Fargo note had been paid off\n   <em>\n    and attached the satisfaction.\n   </em>\n   After the filing of the special defense and satisfaction, Wells Fargo withdrew its complaint.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, as of 2009, Wells\n   Fargo was aware of the existence of the satisfaction purporting to release its mortgage on the property, yet it did nothing to investigate the validity of the satisfaction for\n   <em>\n    eight years.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   We also reject the determination underlying the court's finding of diligence that Wells Fargo was entitled to notice of the supplemental judgment proceedings despite its default for failure to appear \"in the first part of the foreclosure action.\" Our rules of practice do not require service of motions on nonappearing, defaulted parties. See Practice Book \u00a7 10-12 (a) (\"[i]t is the responsibility of counsel or a self-represented party filing the same\n   <em>\n    to serve on each other party who has appeared\n   </em>\n   one copy of every pleading subsequent to the original complaint, every written motion other than one in which an order is sought ex parte and every paper relating to discovery, request, demand, claim, notice or similar paper\" [emphasis added] ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Moreover, Wells Fargo did not demonstrate how its access to information regarding the satisfaction was limited in any way during the present action. In fact, during the hearing on the motion to open, Wells Fargo declined to offer any evidence at all beyond the stipulation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Had it appeared in the present action, it would\n   have received notice of the supplemental judgment proceedings, including Bank of America's motion for a supplemental judgment, to which it attached the satisfaction, and its subsequent motion for reconsideration, which informed the court that the satisfaction had not been recorded on the land records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Lastly, we note that counsel for Wells Fargo conceded during oral argument before this court that Wells Fargo discovered the fraud in 2017 upon a review of its own files. Wells Fargo's apparent failure to conduct such a review sooner, either by its predecessor during the pendency of the two foreclosure actions it initiated or during the course of the present action, repudiates any diligence in trying to uncover fraud. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court's finding that Wells Fargo had satisfied\n   <em>\n    Varley\n   </em>\n   's second factor of \"diligence in the original action, that is, diligence in trying to discover and expose the fraud,\" is clearly erroneous.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because\n   Wells Fargo failed to satisfy the second\n   <em>\n    Varley\n   </em>\n   factor,\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   the court erred in opening the supplemental judgment on the basis of fraud beyond the four month time limitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Bank of America also claims that the court erred in opening the supplemental judgment because the judgment was not procured by any fraud on its part. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   The conclusion underlying the trial court's opening of the supplemental judgment, that the fraudulent action of a defaulted party prior to the litigation at issue satisfies the exception to the four month limitation for judgments obtained by fraud, is a question of law. \"When ... the trial court draws conclusions of law, our review is plenary and we must decide whether its conclusions are legally and logically correct and find support in the facts as they appear in the record.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Saggese\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Beazley Co.
