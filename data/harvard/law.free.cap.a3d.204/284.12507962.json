Following a trial, the jury found that defendant was sixty percent responsible for the accident while Patrick\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   was responsible for the remaining forty percent. The jury awarded plaintiff Mary Dutton, representing her son's estate, $ 500,000 in wrongful death damages and $ 108,000 in survivorship damages. The trial court entered judgment in the sum of $ 364,800 in damages and additional interest, fees, and costs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Defendant appeals from the judgment memorializing the verdict and from the trial court's order denying his motion for a new trial. Among other things, defendant contends that the jury's award of wrongful death damages is unsupported by the evidence, particularly without any expert testimony to substantiate the pecuniary value of the loss of Patrick's advice, guidance, and companionship. We reject defendant's contention and reaffirm the long-standing principle, as expressed in\n   <em>\n    Lesniak v. County of Bergen\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1386003\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/117/12/#p32\">\n    117 N.J. 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 32-33,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=563%20A.2d%20795\">\n    563 A.2d 795\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989), that expert testimony is not required to establish the pecuniary value of such services in claims for wrongful death. For the reasons that follow, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On October 2, 2013, plaintiff filed a civil action under the New Jersey Survivor's Act, N.J.S.A. 2A:15-3, and the New Jersey\n   Wrongful Death Act, N.J.S.A. 2A:31-1 to -6, alleging that defendant's negligent operation of his motor vehicle caused Patrick's death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On August 15, 2016, defendant filed a pretrial motion in limine, arguing that plaintiff's wrongful death claim was barred because plaintiff was not planning to introduce any evidence substantiating the replacement cost of Patrick's advice, guidance, and companionship. The trial court denied the motion, finding it premature to decide whether plaintiff had presented a factual basis for damages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   A jury trial took place between August 16 and August 24, 2016. We recite the relevant facts from the testimony and evidence presented at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <em>\n    Liability-Related Proofs\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On the evening of February 26, 2012 defendant, an off-duty Atlantic City police officer, was driving his SUV in the left lane on the eastbound side of Black Horse Pike in Egg Harbor Township, with his wife, Jennifer Rando, sitting in the passenger seat. Black Horse Pike is a four-lane highway with two eastbound and two westbound lines that are divided by a concrete, grassy median. A two-foot space separates the median from the fog line of the left lane on the eastbound side of the road. The posted speed limit is fifty miles per hour. It was dark that night, ambient lighting was minimal, and the roads were damp and filled with puddles from an earlier thunderstorm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Indisputably, the Rando's SUV struck Patrick that night while the decedent was on his bicycle at or near an intersection between Black Horse Pike and Tower Avenue, where there is a forty-six-foot gap between the concrete medians dividing the highway. The impact sent Patrick several feet in the air until he came to rest on the westbound portion of Black Horse Pike where he bled to death on the road. Patrick was nineteen years old at the time of the accident. At trial, the nature of the collision and how it occurred was heavily disputed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   When Officer Kevin Devlin, of the Egg Harbor Township Police Department,\n   responded to investigate the collision that night, he observed Patrick laying on the westbound side of the road with the remains of the bicycle and other debris scattered throughout the left lane of the eastbound road. Officer Devlin concluded that defendant's SUV hit the bicycle while Patrick was traveling in a westerly direction in the left-hand travel lane of Black Horse Pike eastbound. In Devlin's view, the evidence did not support that the SUV had swerved prior to the collision. Based on the scuff marks on the road, Devlin determined the impact projected Patrick in a northeasterly direction until his body came to rest on the westbound side of the road.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Plaintiff's expert, Dr. Steven Batterman, testified that the physical evidence did not support Officer Devlin's conclusion that a head-on collision occurred in the left lane of the eastbound road. Instead, he believed that the vehicles were perpendicular at the point of impact and that the collision occurred in the center of the intersection in the gap between the concrete medians. Batterman noted the projectile direction of debris from the collision was northeast and that the damage to the SUV was primarily relegated to the front left wheel, headlights, and fender. The lack of damage to the windshield of the SUV, in Batterman's opinion, also weighed against the possibility that the front of the vehicle hit Patrick head-on. Based on the braking distance of the SUV and the amount of damage caused, Batterman believed defendant was traveling between sixty and sixty-five miles per hour prior to impact in an area where the speed limit was fifty. Batterman concluded that defendant was inattentive, failed to observe Patrick, and that \"for reasons unknown\" the SUV swerved to the left, hitting both Patrick and the bicycle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   William Meyer, the defense's accident reconstruction expert, disagreed with Batterman about the point of impact, believing, as Officer Devlin did, that the collision occurred in the left lane of Black Horse Pike eastbound. Because the damage to the bicycle was localized to the front section, Meyer disagreed with Batterman\n   that the vehicles were perpendicular at the point of impact and concluded that Patrick had entered defendant's lane, traveling at a southwest angle. In Meyer's opinion, defendant did not have enough time to observe and react to Patrick to avoid the collision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Defendant testified that he never saw Patrick before he heard and felt the impact of the collision. Jennifer Rando testified that she did see Patrick but only in the moment immediately prior to impact when she had turned to speak to her husband. She attempted to yell to alert him, but it was too late to avoid impact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Apart from the Randos, the only testifying witness who directly observed the collision was Gary Maisano, who stated that he was driving on the eastbound side of Black Horse Pike and drove past Patrick as the latter stood on the median, \"straddling\" his bicycle with his feet on the ground, stationary. Maisano testified that Patrick was perpendicular to Maisano's vehicle, facing south. Immediately after passing Patrick, from his left side view mirror, Maisano observed Patrick's silhouette cross in front of a car just before a loud impact.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   April Roadside, with her passenger, Tamara Baum, was driving in the right lane of the eastbound side of the road behind defendant's SUV prior to the crash. Roadside and Baum both testified that the SUV suddenly swerved left and, immediately afterwards, sparks and debris flew towards them, forcing Roadside to maneuver their car to avoid being hit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   Karen Carboni saw Patrick traveling on Black Horse Pike prior to the accident. Carboni testified that she was driving in\n   the right lane of the eastbound side of the highway when part of Patrick's bicycle came into her lane of travel, causing her to quickly veer left to avoid striking him. Carboni did not see Patrick until she was a car length and a half behind him. Patrick had been dressed in dark clothing and had no visible reflectors on his bicycle, leading Carboni to comment to her daughter seated next to her that Patrick's manner of travel was \"very dangerous.\" Carboni did not see or hear the collision.\n   <em>\n    Damages-Related Proofs\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Plaintiff presented testimony regarding her relationship with Patrick. Patrick's aunt Irene testified that Patrick had been living with her in the year prior to his death, while plaintiff was living in a homeless shelter. Patrick's older brother Brandon testified that Patrick and he had been putting aside money every week to buy plaintiff a house or apartment and that Patrick had been saving between twenty and fifty dollars per paycheck to that end. Irene mostly corroborated Brandon's account, though she recalled that Patrick had been saving between fifty and seventy-five dollars per week and that he had intended to buy a car before purchasing a family home. Irene also recounted that Patrick was outgoing, helpful, and a hard worker with a good reputation at his two jobs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Plaintiff testified that the companionship Patrick provided her was \"definitely one of the important things\" in her life. Plaintiff and Patrick had been speaking over the phone on a nightly basis and saw each other once or twice per week to have meals together, go to the park, or walk the boardwalk, among other activities. Patrick had comforted plaintiff with his words, sense of humor, and displays of affection. Plaintiff attested that these interactions with her late son had given her \"a whole different outlook on life\" and that Patrick \"lifted [her] up even when the clouds were real grey.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Plaintiff also testified that she probably would not have accepted money from either of her sons, because, as their mother, she felt it her duty to help them rather than accept help from them. Though her family offered for plaintiff to stay with them, plaintiff refused, because, in her words, she was \"stubborn\" and \"didn't want to burden\" them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   At the close of plaintiff's case-in-chief, defendant moved for involuntary dismissal of the wrongful death claim, renewing the argument that plaintiff had not provided any evidence of the pecuniary value of the services Patrick provided plaintiff and that no reasonable juror could find that plaintiff had established proof of damages. The court denied the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   <em>\n    The Jury Charge, Verdict, and New Trial Motion\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In the final charge to the jury before deliberation, the trial judge read the model jury charge on wrongful death without objection from either party. Among other things, the model charge directs juries: not to consider either emotional distress plaintiff may have suffered as a result of the decedent's death or emotional satisfaction plaintiff may have derived from the decedent's companionship; to limit the damages to plaintiff's financial loss from the death, including the value of companionship services that Patrick would have provided to plaintiff for the remaining years of her life, had he survived; to estimate the reasonable value of the companionship services provided by determining the value of substantially similar services provided \"by paid companions or homemakers who are often hired by the aged or infirm or ... by nurses or practical nurses\" and to consider that \"future losses cannot go beyond the point when it is expected that [plaintiff] will survive.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Model Jury Charge (Civ\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    il)\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   , 8.43, \"Wrongful Death\" (March 2010). In accordance with the model charge, the court advised the jury that plaintiff's anticipated life expectancy was 29.4 years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On the second day of deliberations, the jury asked the court for an \"explanation/clarification of question number 7,\" which was the question on the verdict sheet pertaining to wrongful death damages. With no party objecting, the trial judge once again issued the wrongful death model charge.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   On the same afternoon, the jury reached its verdict, finding that defendant and Patrick were both negligent and that each proximately caused the collision, with sixty percent of the liability residing with defendant and forty percent with Patrick. The jury awarded plaintiff a gross sum of $ 108,000 for Patrick's conscious pain and suffering on the Survivor's Act claim and a gross sum of $ 500,000 for the pecuniary loss of Patrick's advice, counsel, and companionship on the Wrongful Death Act claim. The court molded the awards to the sum of $ 364,800 to reflect decedent's comparative fault.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Defendant moved for a new trial, which the trial court denied on September 30, 2016. On the same day, the court entered an order for judgment, finding defendant liable to plaintiff in the molded sum of $ 364,800 in damages. Having found that the jury verdict was more than 120% of the claimant's offer of judgment, pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Rule\n   </em>\n   4:58-2, the court awarded an additional $ 31,207.89 in accrued interest, $ 80,162.50 in attorney fees, and $ 20,331.06 in litigation costs, resulting in a total award and final judgment of $ 496,501.45.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   This appeal followed. On appeal, defendant raises the following points for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   I. The evidence clearly established that the defendant was not at fault for the happening of plaintiff's decedent's accident - much less a finding that defendant's fault was greater than that of plaintiff's decedent - therefore the only explanation for the jury's verdict is sympathy, bias, pity and passion and the trial court erred in not vacating the jury's liability verdict.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   II. As plaintiff failed to present her wrongful death claim in a manner which would permit the jury to fashion an award for the pecuniary value of plaintiff's loss of advice, counsel and companionship without speculating, the trial court erred in permitting the issue to go to the jury and erred in failing to vacate the jury's ultimate award of damages.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Plaintiff has not cross-appealed on any issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   II.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Turning to defendant's first point, we find that the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion for a new trial on liability. \"The standard of review on appeal from decisions on motions for a new trial is the same as that governing the trial judge-whether there was a miscarriage of justice under the law.\"\n   <em>\n    Risko v.

To overturn a jury verdict, \"[t]he verdict must shock the judicial conscience.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"712182,712190\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/643/564/\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Applying this deferential standard of review, we find that the jury's liability verdict neither shocks the judicial conscience nor amounts to a miscarriage of justice. In denying the motion for a new trial, the trial court held that the jury's verdict regarding defendant's apportioned liability was \"not clearly and convincingly contrary to the weight of the evidence.\" The court reasoned:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   Witnesses testified as to the decedent's visibility and location, as well Defendant's actions, such that the jury's finding of Defendant's 60% liability for the accident would not be clearly and convincingly contrary to the weight of the evidence. Specifically, other vehicle operators and Defendant's passenger visibly saw decedent prior to the collision, one witness testified that the decedent was on the median prior to the collision and not in Defendant's lane of traffic, and a further witness testified to seeing Defendant's vehicle swerve toward the median prior to the collision. In light of such facts, it would not be unreasonable for a factfinder to find liability as the jury in this case did, and thus this argument fails.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Having reviewed the record, we conclude that the trial judge's findings and reasoning are amply supported by the record. We therefore affirm the trial court's order denying defendant's motion for a new trial on liability.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   B.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   We next address defendant's argument that the jury's award of wrongful death damages is unsupported by any evidence that would permit the jury to fashion an award for the pecuniary value of plaintiff's loss of advice, counsel and companionship. Specifically, defendant contends the trial court erred in denying his motion for an involuntary dismissal of plaintiff's wrongful\n   death claim at the close of plaintiff's case-in-chief and in refusing to vacate the jury's verdict awarding a gross sum of $ 500,000 in wrongful death damages. Defendant argues that either expert or other specific testimony was required as a matter of law to substantiate the economic value of Patrick's lost companionship. In the absence of this evidence, defendant claims, the verdict could only have been premised on \"pure speculation coupled with sympathy, passion and prejudice.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In addressing defendant's arguments, we first consider the background of New Jersey's Wrongful Death Act. When a defendant is found liable under the Wrongful Death Act for negligently causing a person's death, the jury may award \"such damages as they shall deem fair and just with reference to the pecuniary injuries resulting from such death, together with the hospital, medical and funeral expenses incurred for the deceased, to the persons entitled to any intestate personal property of the decedent.\" N.J.S.A. 2A:31-5.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   As no civil remedy for wrongful death existed under the common law,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    generally\n   </em>\n   Jacob A.
