(Mother) petitions for review of a final order of the Department of Human Services (Department), Bureau of Hearings and Appeals (Bureau), that dismissed her request for a hearing on two founded reports naming her as a perpetrator of abuse of her twin daughters.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The County Children &amp; Youth Social Service Agency (CYS) initially issued an indicated report. However, after Mother entered an accelerated rehabilitative disposition (ARD) program to resolve a criminal charge of child endangerment, CYS amended the reports to founded. The Department dismissed Mother's request for a hearing for the stated reason she had no right to an administrative hearing on a founded report. In this case of first impression, Mother argues that because the ARD proceeding did not adjudicate any of the facts that were recited in the founded reports, she is entitled to an evidentiary hearing. We reverse and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On July 6, 2017, CYS filed indicated reports that named Mother as a perpetrator of abuse of her twin daughters, C.F. and Chl.F., then 15 months old. The two reports were identical, except for the name of the child. The reports stated that on May 7, 2017, at 2:00 a.m., the police found Mother semi-conscious and intoxicated on a public street and transported her to a hospital for suspected alcohol poisoning. At 6:30 a.m., the hospital contacted police because Mother informed the staff that her two children were home alone. The police went to Mother's residence, where they met W.F. (Father), who worked the late shift. He had been called to the hospital but headed home when he learned that the children were alone. Father and the police found the twins asleep in their cribs. The report stated that Mother admitted that she had left the twins home alone to go to a bar.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The police charged Mother with the crime of \"endangering the welfare of children.\" 18 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 4304(a)(1).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The criminal complaint stated as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   [Mother] did on or about, May 7\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   2017, in the County of [ ], while supervising the welfare of a child under 18 years of age commit[ ] an offense [by] knowingly endanger[ing] the welfare of the child by violating a duty of care, protection or support, that is to say [Mother] did leave her two (2), 15[-]month[-]old children alone in their respective cribs, with no other adult supervision in the home and left the residence during the hours of 0100 through 0800 hours. This is in violation of Section 4304(a)(1) of the Pennsylvania Crimes Code, as amended, 18 Pa.C.S. [\u00a7]4304(a)(1).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Criminal Complaint at 2; Reproduced Record at 4a (R.R. ----). The affidavit of probable cause filed in support of the criminal complaint stated, in relevant part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   2. On 7 May 2017 at 0643 hours, [police officers were] dispatched to [Mother's residence] for a check on the welfare complaint. The complainant was the Charge Nurse at the [ ] Emergency Room. The request made at the time was for the [police] to check on (2) two children who were left alone at the residence. The complainant reported the person making the request was the children's mother who was in the Emergency Room and was intoxicated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-16\">\n   3. [An officer] responded to the residence and attempted to make contact with the occupants.... He had no other information as to who the children were or how old they were. There was no response from the residence after repeated knocking on the door. [The officer] contacted the Charge Nurse for more information and was advised [Father] had just arrived at the [h]ospital, learned that the children were alone, and [was on his way to the residence]. [The officer] stayed at [the residence] awaiting [Father's] arrival.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   4. At approximately 0745 hours, [Father] arrived at his residence and entered the residence with Officer [ ]. No persons were found in the home except for [C.F. and Chl.F.]. [C.F. and Chl.F.] are 15[-]month[-]old twin females. They were found asleep in their respective cribs on the 2\n   <sup>\n    nd\n   </sup>\n   floor of the residence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   5. While waiting for the arrival of [Father at the residence], [the officer] was contacted by the [ ] Borough Police and informed that [Mother] had been transported to the [hospital] at about 0230 hours on May 7\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   2017 due to being extremely intoxicated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   6. On 9 May 2017, [Mother] was interviewed [by the police]. [Mother] admitted to leaving the residence sometime after 0001 (sic) hours on May 7\n   <sup>\n    th\n   </sup>\n   2017 and going to [a bar] and consuming alcohol to the point that she lost consciousness.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Affidavit of Probable Cause, \u00b6\u00b6 2-6; R.R. 6a.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On August 3, 2017, Mother appealed the indicated reports and requested a hearing. The Department assigned her appeal to an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) to conduct a hearing. Prior to the hearing, CYS amended the reports, changing their status from indicated to founded. This was based on Mother's acceptance into an ARD program on the criminal charge of \"child endangerment.\" CYS filed a motion to dismiss Mother's appeals, asserting that because Mother was named as a perpetrator in a founded report, she had no right to a hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Mother filed a response, asserting that the facts recited in the affidavit of probable cause for the criminal charges did not constitute serious physical neglect under the Child Protective Services Law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   23 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 6303(a). She further asserted that acceptance into the ARD program to resolve a criminal charge of child endangerment did not constitute an adjudication of the facts set forth in the criminal complaint or in the founded reports.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The ALJ issued a recommended report that Mother's request for a hearing be dismissed. The ALJ noted that the Child Protective Services Law,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , defines a \"founded report\" as one issued where \"[t]here has been an acceptance into an accelerated rehabilitative disposition program and the reason for the acceptance involves the same factual circumstances involved in the allegation of child abuse.\" 23 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 6303(a). The ALJ concluded that the reason for Mother's acceptance into ARD on the child endangerment charge involved the same factual circumstances covered in the founded reports. Accordingly, CYS appropriately revised the indicated reports to founded reports. Because the Child Protective Services Law does not authorize an administrative hearing on a founded report, the ALJ granted CYS's motion to dismiss Mother's hearing request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The Bureau adopted the ALJ's recommended adjudication in its entirety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    Appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Mother petitioned for this Court's review, raising one issue.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   She asserts that the Bureau erred in dismissing her appeal without an evidentiary hearing. Her acceptance into ARD did not adjudicate the factual allegations in the criminal complaint or in the affidavit of probable cause. There has never been a hearing in any tribunal to adjudicate those facts. Stated otherwise, the factual claims in the founded reports to support the conclusion that Mother committed \"serious physical neglect\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   have never been adjudicated. Further, a defendant may be innocent of the criminal charge but choose ARD simply to avoid the risk of an unfair verdict. Mother contends that she is entitled to an evidentiary hearing to provide her version of events and to explain her reasons for entering into ARD.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The Department responds that the affidavit of probable cause contains the same statements as those recited in the founded reports. Thus, Mother's acceptance into ARD constitutes a founded report of child neglect, and the Child Protective Services Law does not authorize any perpetrator a hearing on a founded report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    The Child Protective Services Law\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   There are two different types of child abuse reports that are maintained by the\n   ChildLine Registry:\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   indicated and founded. The Child Protective Services Law defines an indicated report as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   (1) Subject to paragraphs (2) and (3), a report of child abuse made pursuant to this chapter if an investigation by the department or county agency determines that substantial evidence of the alleged abuse by a perpetrator exists based on any of the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-31\">\n   (i) Available medical evidence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-32\">\n   (ii) The child protective service investigation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   (iii) An admission of the acts of abuse by the perpetrator.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   (2) A report may be indicated under paragraph (1)(i) or (ii) for any child who is the victim of child abuse, regardless of the number of alleged perpetrators.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-35\">\n   (3) A report may be indicated under paragraph (1)(i) or (ii) listing the perpetrator as \"unknown\" if substantial evidence of abuse by a perpetrator exists, but the department or county agency is unable to identify the specific perpetrator.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   23 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 6303(a). By contrast, a founded report of child abuse is issued,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , in the following circumstances:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   A child abuse report involving a perpetrator that is made pursuant to this chapter, if any of the following applies:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   (1)\n   <em>\n    There has been a judicial adjudication based on a finding that a child who is a subject of the report has been abused and the adjudication involves the same factual circumstances involved in the allegation of child abuse\n   </em>\n   . The judicial adjudication may include any of the following:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   (i) The entry of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-40\">\n   (ii) A finding of guilt to a criminal charge.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-41\">\n   (iii) A finding of dependency under 42 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 6341 (relating to adjudication) if the court has entered a finding that a child who is the subject of the report has been abused.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   (iv) A finding of delinquency under 42 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 6341 if the court has entered a finding that the child who is the subject of the report has been abused by the child who was found to be delinquent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   (2) There has been an acceptance into an accelerated rehabilitative disposition program and the\n   <em>\n    reason for the acceptance involves the same factual circumstances involved in the allegation of child abuse\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   23 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 6303(a) (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The Child Protective Services Law allows a perpetrator of child abuse named in an indicated report to request the expunction of that report from the ChildLine Registry. Section 6341states, in relevant part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   (a) General rule. - Notwithstanding section 6338.1 (relating to expunction of information of perpetrator who was under 18 years of age when child abuse was committed):\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-47\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-48\">\n   (2) Any person named as a perpetrator, and any school employee named, in an indicated report of child abuse may, within 90 days of being notified of the status of the report, request an administrative review by, or appeal\n   and request a hearing before, the secretary to amend or expunge an indicated report on the grounds that it is inaccurate or it is being maintained in a manner inconsistent with this chapter. The request shall be in writing in a manner prescribed by the department.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   (c) Review of refusal of request.--Subject to subsection (c.1), if the secretary refuses a request under subsection (a)(1) or a request for administrative review under subsection (a)(2), or does not act within the prescribed time, the perpetrator or school employee shall have the right to appeal and request a hearing before the secretary to amend or expunge an indicated report on the grounds that it is inaccurate or it is being maintained in a manner inconsistent with this chapter....\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   (c.1) Founded reports.--A person named as a perpetrator in a founded report of child abuse must provide to the department a court order indicating that the underlying adjudication that formed the basis of the founded report has been reversed or vacated.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   (c.2)\n   <em>\n    Hearing.--A person making an appeal under subsection (a)(2) or (c) shall have the right to a timely hearing to determine the merits of the appeal\n   </em>\n   ....\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   23 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 6341 (emphasis added). The hearing guaranteed by Section 6341(c.2) of the Child Protective Services Law is limited to indicated reports and does not apply to founded reports. The Child Protective Services Law is silent with respect to hearings on founded reports.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    Relevant Precedent\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    J.G. v.

Cmwlth. 2002), the CYS issued an indicated report of child abuse against both parents because their two-month-old son suffered from \"a condition commonly known as 'Shaken Baby Syndrome.' \" J.G. (the mother) appealed. In a civil proceeding involving both parents, the child was found to be the victim of child abuse and adjudicated dependent by a trial court. Based on the trial court's adjudication, CYS amended the indicated report to founded. The Department dismissed the mother's appeal because the Child Protective Services Law does not provide for a hearing on founded reports. The mother petitioned for this Court's review, and we concluded that the mother was entitled to a hearing before the Department.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   We acknowledged that the Child Protective Services Law did not provide a mechanism for a perpetrator to challenge a founded report. However, we concluded that \"[t]his statutory omission does not mean that a named perpetrator in a founded report does not have any right of appeal.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9428418\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/795/1089/#p1090\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9428418\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/795/1089/#p1090\">\n    at 1092\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In reaching this conclusion, we looked to the Administrative Agency Law, which defines an \"adjudication\" as a final order that affects a person's personal or property rights or privilege. 2 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 101.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   A founded report of child abuse constitutes an \"adjudication\" because it impacts a \"perpetrator's personal rights by branding him or her as a child\n   abuser in a Statewide central register of child abuse.\"\n   <em>\n    J.G.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9428418\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/795/1089/#p1090\">\n    795 A.2d at 1092\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Administrative Agency Law expressly states that no agency adjudication is valid unless the parties thereto are given a hearing. 2 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 504.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, a founded report issued without a hearing on the factual statements in the report constitutes an invalid adjudication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   In the dependency proceeding that took place in\n   <em>\n    J.G.\n   </em>\n   , the trial court found that the child suffered physical abuse while under the supervision of both parents. However, it did not find that the mother was the one who committed the abuse. Because this critical factual question had not been decided, the mother was entitled to an administrative hearing before the Department to challenge the accuracy of the founded report naming her as a perpetrator of child abuse. We reversed the Department's dismissal of her appeal and remanded the matter for hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In reaching this conclusion, this Court cautioned that an administrative hearing on a founded report will not be allowed where it would constitute a collateral attack of a judicial adjudication. We stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-59\">\n   Where ... a founded report is based upon a judicial adjudication in a non-criminal proceeding, such as a dependency action, in which the court enters a finding that the child was abused, but does not issue a corresponding finding that the named perpetrator was responsible for the abuse,\n   <em>\n    a named perpetrator is entitled to an administrative appeal before the secretary to determine whether the underlying adjudication of child abuse supports a \"founded report\" of abuse.\n   </em>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   <em>\n    J.G.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9428418\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/795/1089/#p1090\">\n    795 A.2d at 1093\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    R.F. v.

On appeal, this Court held that the father was entitled to a hearing as to whether the\n   <em>\n    nolo contendere\n   </em>\n   plea itself established child sexual abuse.

None of the facts recited in the founded reports have ever been adjudicated in a court of law. Mother asserts that the criminal charge of \"child endangerment\" is not the same as \"serious physical neglect,\" which must be \"repeated, prolonged or egregious.\" 23 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 6303(a). The Department responds that\n   <em>\n    J.G.\n   </em>\n   is distinguishable because it involved a dependency proceeding. Mother cannot be permitted to lodge a collateral attack on her entry into an ARD program, which involves a criminal, not a civil, matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   It is well established that a judgment of a court of law cannot be subjected\n   to collateral attack in a subsequent proceeding. Our Supreme Court has held that \"a judgment, order or decree rendered by a court having jurisdiction of the parties and the subject matter, unless reversed or annulled in some proper proceeding, is not open to collateral attack in any other proceeding.\"\n   <em>\n    Moeller v.

There was no answer, and police were unaware that the children were inside. Subsequently, a charge nurse contacted police, who went to Petitioner's home again at 6:30 a.m. and again found no response. The children's father went to the hospital and was directed to go home.

Criminal docket, S.R.R. at 33b. Based on Petitioner's admission into ARD, CYS amended the indicated reports of child abuse to founded reports of child abuse, in accord with Section 6303 of the CPSL, 23 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 6303.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   On December 18, 2017, the County Solicitor filed a Motion to Dismiss Petitioner's appeal from the indicated reports because the reports were amended from indicated to founded based on Petitioner's admission into ARD. Thereafter, Petitioner requested a hearing, asserting that the findings in the affidavit of probable cause do not meet the definition of child abuse and that an ARD disposition on charges of Endangering the Welfare of a Child does not provide\n   a basis for a founded report of child abuse.\n   <em>\n    Specifically\n   </em>\n   , citing Section 6303(b.1) of the CPSL, Petitioner alleged that the facts supporting probable cause for the charges of Endangering the Welfare of a Child do not establish that Petitioner created an imminent risk of serious physical injury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   An administrative law judge (ALJ) of the Department of Human Services, Bureau of Hearings and Appeals (BHA) considered Petitioner's request \"to overturn founded reports of child abuse.\" R.R. at 8a. The ALJ explained that Section 6303(b.1)\n   <em>\n    does not require\n   </em>\n   that a child suffer serious physical injury or that a perpetrator\n   <em>\n    create an imminent risk of serious physical injury\n   </em>\n   . Instead, under Section 6303(b.1),\n   <em>\n    causing serious physical neglect\n   </em>\n   of a child constitutes child abuse. R.R. at 12a. Further, the ALJ explained, \"serious physical neglect\" is defined in part as a repeated, prolonged, or\n   <em>\n    egregious failure to supervise a child\n   </em>\n   in a manner that is appropriate considering the child's developmental age and abilities, and that endangers a child's life or health or threatens the child's well-being. The ALJ noted that the criminal complaint stated that Petitioner left her 15-month-old children home alone for approximately seven hours and that the CYS investigative reports concluded that by doing so she caused serious physical neglect of C.F. and Chl.F. As set forth in investigative reports, the agency's investigations confirmed the relevant facts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The ALJ determined that the identical actions that are described in the affidavit of probable cause and the CYS investigative reports \"unequivocally meet the definition of child abuse. [Petitioner] failed to supervise two 15-month-old children for at least seven hours while [she] was drinking at a bar, constituting a prolonged and egregious failure to supervise that endangered the children's life, health and well-being.\" R.R. at 12a. Finally, the ALJ explained that the ARD disposition on charges of Endangering the Welfare of a Child provided a basis for a founded report of child abuse under Section 6303 of the CPSL because the reason for the acceptance \"involves the same factual circumstances involved in the allegation of child abuse.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9410009\" index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/801/646/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The ALJ issued a decision on February 28, 2018, recommending that Petitioner's appeal be dismissed. R.R. at 7a. The ALJ's recommendation was adopted in its entirety by Final Administrative Action dated March 28, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   <strong>\n    Issue on appeal\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   On appeal to this Court, Petitioner argues that the record does not establish that \"the ARD disposition produced a judicial finding concerning the\n   <em>\n    severity of any injuries or level of risk Petitioner created by her actions\n   </em>\n   because there is no record of the ARD proceeding.\" Petitioner's brief at 8 (emphasis added). She further contends that, without a record of the ARD proceeding, \"there is no reliable way to determine if there has been an acceptance into ARD and [that] the reason for the acceptance involves the same factual circumstances involved in the allegation of child abuse.\" Petitioner's brief at 9. Simply, Petitioner argues that in the absence of a transcript of the ARD proceeding, the criteria for issuing a founded report set forth in Section 6303 of the CPSL were not established in this case. Petitioner's argument specifically relies on a different definition of \"child abuse\" than CYS has consistently cited.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   As to Petitioner's first argument, the ALJ already explained that the definition of \"child abuse\" in Section 6303(b.1) of the CPSL does not require a determination concerning the severity of injuries or the level of risk created by Petitioner's actions. As to her second contention, the criminal\n   docket sufficiently demonstrates that Petitioner was accepted into ARD to resolve pending charges of Endangering the Welfare of a Child. S.R.R. at 31b-38b. Petitioner\n   <em>\n    has never challenged the accuracy of the documents reflecting\n   </em>\n   that she admittedly left her 15-month-old daughters alone in their cribs overnight. Petitioner's assertion that the\n   <em>\n    statutory criteria\n   </em>\n   for issuance of a founded report have not been met necessarily fails.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   To the extent Petitioner raises the question, the remaining issue is whether the provisions of the CPSL are sufficient to satisfy due process concerns. The Majority concludes that a hearing not afforded under the CPSL is required.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     J.G.\n    </em>\n    and\n    <em>\n     R.F.\n    </em>\n    are distinguishable\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   Our decision in\n   <em>\n    J.G.\n   </em>\n   does not support this result.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   To the contrary, in\n   <em>\n    J.G.,\n   </em>\n   where both parents were named in a founded report of child abuse, we sustained the mother's appeal and held that a founded report of abuse is appealable \"\n   <em>\n    for the limited purpose\n   </em>\n   of determining whether or not the underlying adjudication supports a founded report\n   <em>\n    that the named perpetrator is responsible\n   </em>\n   for the abuse.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9410009\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/801/646/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added). Here, there is no confusion as to the identity of the person who left the two 15-month-old children alone in their cribs overnight.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    J.G.\n   </em>\n   , this Court also stated, without elaboration, that a \"founded report of child\n   abuse\n   <em>\n    constitutes an adjudication\n   </em>\n   as it is a final determination [that] affects a named perpetrator's personal rights\n   <em>\n    by branding him or her as a child abuser\n   </em>\n   on a Statewide central register of child abuse.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9428418\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/795/1089/#p1090\">\n    795 A.2d at 1092\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added). We have often repeated that conclusory statement. However, a founded report does not decide disputed charges or facts. Rather, a founded report has always been\n   <em>\n    premised upon a prior adjudication\n   </em>\n   , or, as now amended, a voluntary disposition of charges. Consequently, it is more accurate to say that a founded report\n   <em>\n    is a reflection of an adjudication\n   </em>\n   , not an adjudication in and of itself.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Our decision in\n   <em>\n    R.F.\n   </em>\n   is likewise distinguishable. Therein, the founded report named a parent who pled\n   <em>\n    nolo contendere\n   </em>\n   to\n   <em>\n    child abuse\n   </em>\n   as a perpetrator of child\n   <em>\n    sexual\n   </em>\n   abuse. We held that the parent was entitled to a hearing to determine whether the plea itself established child sexual abuse. Here, however, and as explained by the ALJ,\n   <em>\n    Petitioner does not dispute\n   </em>\n   that\n   <em>\n    her entry into the ARD program and the founded report of child abuse were based on identical factual circumstances\n   </em>\n   : Petitioner's leaving her 15-month-old children alone for more than seven hours.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   This case does not raise questions as to the identity of the perpetrator or to Petitioner's conduct on May 7, 2017. Because the facts in this appeal are completely dissimilar to the facts in\n   <em>\n    J.G.\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    R.F.\n   </em>\n   , I believe the Majority's reliance on these opinions is misplaced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     R. v.

Further, as explained below, I believe that the CPSL's criteria regarding indicated and founded reports provide adequate safeguards to protect an individual's right to reputation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   <strong>\n    ARD\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Because Petitioner's argument involves ARD proceedings, a brief review of Chapter 3 of the Rules of Criminal Procedure (Rules), which govern ARD, is provided.

In other words, a founded report was not, itself, an adjudication of facts, but a consequence of facts previously decided in a judicial adjudication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   As amended in 2013, Section 6303(a) of the CPSL now states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-132\">\n   <strong>\n    \"Founded report.\"\n   </strong>\n   -A child abuse report involving a perpetrator that is made pursuant to this chapter, if any of the following applies:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-133\">\n   (1) There has been a judicial adjudication based on a finding that a child who is a subject of the report has been abused and the adjudication involves the same factual circumstances involved in the allegation of child abuse.

The voluntary occurrences identified in subsections (2) and (3) as criteria for a founded report must involve the same factual circumstances involved in the allegation of child abuse, but they do not involve an adjudication. Each of these voluntary occurrences offers the individual an opportunity for rehabilitation and the expungement of her criminal records, under terms and conditions that balance the community's need for protection. In any event, a founded report always requires that the adjudication or voluntary predicate involves the same factual circumstances that are involved in the allegation of child abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   <em>\n    Here, Petitioner does not argue that the factual circumstances are not the same,\n   </em>\n   but instead sets forth an irrelevant argument, that the facts do not establish the \"\n   <em>\n    severity of any injuries or level of risk Petitioner created by her actions.\"\n   </em>\n   Petitioner's brief at 8. Petitioner\n   <em>\n    does not assert\n   </em>\n   that the criminal charges disposed of by ARD were not based on facts evincing a \"failure to supervise\" as contemplated by Section 6303(a) of the CPSL. Because she does not argue that the factual circumstances are not the same,\n   <em>\n    J.G.\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    R.F.\n   </em>\n   are materially distinguishable, and a hearing could serve no discernable purpose.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   <strong>\n    Section 6341\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   Section 6341 allows a hearing for amendment or expunction of information in limited circumstances.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   For an indicated report, which may be based on an investigation and does not require a prior adjudication, those circumstances include newly discovered evidence or evidence that the perpetrator no longer represents a risk of child abuse. 23 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 6341(a)(1). The agency supports an indicated report of child abuse by way of substantial evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   For a founded report, which is based on a\n   <em>\n    prior judicial adjudication or a voluntary judicial disposition\n   </em>\n   , the circumstances constituting good cause to amend or expunge a report are a court order reflecting that the adjudication that formed the basis of the founded report has been reversed or vacated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   23 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 6341(c.1). When a founded report is premised on entry in ARD, the requisite order becomes available upon successful completion of the program.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   In my view, the CPSL affords different but adequate due process for challenging both indicated and founded reports.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   <strong>\n    Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-150\">\n   Consistent with their distinct underlying purposes, the Rules governing ARD and the provisions of the CPSL allow for different consequences for Petitioner's leaving her 15-month-old daughters alone and unsupervised overnight. ARD offers Petitioner an opportunity to avoid a criminal conviction based on her admitted conduct and start over with a \"clean slate.\" The lack of a transcript of the ARD hearing is required by the Rules and serves to benefit defendants. The CPSL serves different purposes, including the swift and competent investigation of reported child abuse and \"providing protection for children from further abuse.\" Section 6302 of the CPSL, 23 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 6302. In furtherance of those purposes, the CPSL provides that judicial adjudications and voluntary dispositions of criminal charges based on facts establishing child abuse support the issuance of a founded report. By now recognizing that persons can avoid adjudication of criminal charges by way of ARD or consent decree, the legislature has arguably filled a preexisting statutory gap.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   Our Supreme Court has recognized that harm to one's constitutionally protected right to reputation is not, as suggested by\n   <em>\n    J.G.\n   </em>\n   , an inevitable result of being named in a founded report. Moreover, an individual who does not contest that the adjudication or voluntary disposition \"involves the same factual circumstances\" involved in the allegation of child abuse does not fall within the narrow application of\n   <em>\n    J.G.\n   </em>\n   or\n   <em>\n    R.F.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   The Majority concludes that Petitioner \"is entitled to a hearing on whether CYS correctly amended the indicated reports of child abuse to make them founded reports.\" Majority op. at 1049. Because Petitioner\n   <em>\n    does not argue\n   </em>\n   that her ARD disposition involves different factual circumstances than are involved in the allegation of child abuse, she raises no issue necessitating a hearing under the CPSL.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Based on the foregoing, I would clarify our analysis in\n   <em>\n    J.G.,\n   </em>\n   and I would affirm the final order of the BHA.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-156\">\n    Two founded reports were filed, one for each child, but both reports arose from a single incident of \"serious physical neglect.\" Stated otherwise, the two reports involve a single incident.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-157\">\n    The Crimes Code defines \"endangering the welfare of children\" as follows:\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-158\">\n    (1) A parent, guardian or other person supervising the welfare of a child under 18 years of age, or a person that employs or supervises such a person, commits an offense if he knowingly endangers the welfare of the child by violating a duty of care, protection or support.\n   </blockquote>\n   <p id=\"p-159\">\n    18 Pa.
