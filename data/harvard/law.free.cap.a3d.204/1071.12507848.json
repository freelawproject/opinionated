(Christy's). In the wake of that collision, Christy's brought a declaratory judgment action in the Superior Court, naming as defendants both Mr. Lanoie and his insurer, Massachusetts Homeland Insurance Company (Homeland).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   On January 25, 2016, the Providence County Superior Court denied Christy's motion for summary judgment and granted Homeland's cross-motion for summary judgment, after hearings were conducted with respect to both motions. The grant of summary judgment was predicated on the hearing justice's determination that Christy's lacked standing. However, after ruling that Christy's lacked standing, the hearing justice nonetheless went on to opine that Mr. Lanoie's policy of insurance with Homeland did not provide coverage for the collision at issue and that such coverage was not statutorily mandated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Christy's timely appealed to this Court, contending that the hearing justice incorrectly determined: (1) that Homeland did not waive standing as a defense; (2) that Christy's did not have standing to pursue the declaratory judgment action; (3) that Homeland's insurance policy did not provide coverage with respect to the collision at issue; and (4) that coverage was not mandated by G.L. 1956 \u00a7 27-7-6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the hearing justice's ruling with respect to Christy's lack of standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Travel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   In relating the pertinent facts, we rely primarily upon the transcripts of the November 17 and December 17, 2015 hearings in the Superior Court as well as other documents contained in the record before us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   <strong>\n    A\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   <strong>\n    Underlying Truck Rental Agreement and Accident\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On October 9, 2012, Mr. Lanoie entered into a Rental Agreement with Christy's for the purpose of renting a 2007 Mitsubishi Fuso box truck for one day. At that time, Mr. Lanoie was employed by a barbecue vendor as a manager. It is uncontested that he rented the truck in order to transport barbecue equipment back to the vendor's home base after the equipment had been used at a seasonal fair in Topsfield, Massachusetts. When he entered into the\n   Rental Agreement, Mr. Lanoie declined to purchase the proffered \"Liability Protection\" option, and he so indicated by affixing his initials to a section of the Rental Agreement that acknowledged that he \"agree[d] to be responsible for all damage or loss [he might] cause to others.\" At the time that he signed the agreement with Christy's, Mr. Lanoie had a personal automobile insurance policy issued by Homeland. That policy covered Mr. Lanoie's personal vehicle from November 6, 2011 through November 6, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   It is uncontested that, on October 10, 2012, Mr. Lanoie returned the rental vehicle to Christy's and that a corner of the vehicle had been damaged as a result of colliding with a concession trailer at the fair. The concession trailer was owned by Dean and Flynn Fiesta Shows (Dean and Flynn). It appears that the trailer incurred damages in the amount of $ 1,300; Dean and Flynn was compensated by Christy's on December 7, 2012. Several months later, in April of 2014, Christy's sued Mr. Lanoie in order to recover the amount paid to Dean and Flynn and to obtain compensation for the damages to the Christy's vehicle. At the same time, Christy's filed the instant declaratory judgment action against Homeland.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   <strong>\n    B\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    Declaratory Judgment Action Against Homeland\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In the declaratory judgment action against Homeland, Christy's sought a ruling that the damages Mr. Lanoie caused to its rental vehicle and to the Dean and Flynn trailer were covered under Mr. Lanoie's policy with Homeland. In its answer, Homeland asserted that Mr. Lanoie's policy did \"not cover the damages for which the plaintiff complains.\" Homeland also denied many of the allegations set forth in the petition for declaratory judgment-notably including Christy's allegation that the Superior Court \"has jurisdiction to declare the rights, status, and legal relations of the parties pursuant to R.I.G.L. 9-30-1\" and its allegation that \"[t]here is an actual dispute between Plaintiff Christy's Auto Rentals, Inc. and Defendants Massachusetts Homeland Insurance Company and Christian R. Lanoie under the above policy.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On August 21, 2015, Homeland filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing \"that no material issue of fact is in dispute between the parties with regard to [Homeland's] liability to the plaintiff because * * * the plaintiff lacks standing to maintain this direct action against this defendant[.]\" On August 27, 2015, Christy's filed a cross-motion for summary judgment, contending: (1) that \"Homeland * * * waived its right to avail itself of the standing defense by failing to assert it in its Answer;\" and (2) that \"Homeland's argument regarding Christy's standing to assert this declaratory judgment action is fallacious and contrary to the plain language and legislative intent of the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act.\" The hearing justice conducted hearings on the issue of standing on November 17 and December 17, 2015. At the conclusion of the latter hearing, the hearing justice ruled from the bench.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   In his bench decision, the hearing justice ruled that, because standing was \"raised in\n   a motion for summary judgment where the plaintiff had the opportunity and in fact argues substantively on the issue and had the right to address it[;] * * * the issue was not waived by the failure to put it in the answer.\" Having determined that there was no waiver, the hearing justice then proceeded to rule on the merits of the standing argument and held that \"this claim is barred because * * * Christy's lacks standing.\" The hearing justice acknowledged that \"the Supreme Court has never firmly decided this,\" but he noted that \"I do see language that says that in Rhode Island and most other jurisdictions an injured party lacks standing to maintain a direct action for damages against a tortfeasor's insurer until and unless the injured party secured a judgment against the tortfeasor.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Although he had just specifically determined that Christy's lacked standing, the hearing justice did not simply decline to opine on other issues. Instead, he went on to state that, \"even if they [i.e., Christy's] had standing in this particular instance, there wouldn't be coverage under the policy * * *.\" He additionally held that the Rental Agreement at issue \"is not covered by [ \u00a7 27-7-6 ].\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, the hearing justice granted Homeland's motion for summary judgment and denied Christy's cross-motion. Final judgment entered in favor of Homeland on January 25, 2016, and Christy's timely appealed to this Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   It is well established that \"[t]his Court examines an appeal from cross-motions for summary judgment\n   <em>\n    de novo\n   </em>\n   \" and that we \"apply the same standards as those used by the trial court.\"\n   <em>\n    Glassie v.

We will affirm a hearing justice's decision to grant summary judgment \"when, viewing the facts and all reasonable inferences therefrom in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party, the [C]ourt determines that there are no issues of material fact in dispute, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12322056\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/159/88/#p93\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).

Christy's points to Rules 8(c) and 12(h) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure as being supportive of its contention that standing is \"an affirmative defense that may be waived if not properly pled in the answer.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Rule 8(c) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure reads as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \"In pleading to a preceding pleading, a party shall set forth affirmatively accord and satisfaction, arbitration and award, assumption of risk, discharge in bankruptcy, duress, estoppel, failure of consideration, fraud, illegality, injury by fellow servant, laches, license, payment, release, res judicata, statute of frauds, statute of limitations, waiver, and any other matter constituting an avoidance or affirmative defense.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   And Rule 12(h) of the Superior Court Rules of Civil Procedure reads in pertinent part as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-36\">\n   \"A party waives all defenses and objections which the party does not present either by motion as hereinbefore provided or, if the party has made no motion, in the party's answer or reply[.]\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   It is patently clear that standing is not specifically listed in Rule 8(c) as an affirmative defense that is considered to be waived if not presented in a motion, answer, or reply in accordance with Rule 12(h). Nonetheless, in its appellate brief, Christy's argues that one should read this Court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Direct Action for Rights and Equality v. Gannon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11809224\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/713/218/\">\n    713 A.2d 218\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (R.I. 1998), as supportive of its contention that Rules 8(c) and 12(h) mean that standing \"may be waived if not properly pled in the answer.\" In our view, however, Christy's reads this Court's opinion in\n   <em>\n    Direct Action\n   </em>\n   far too broadly. The\n   <em>\n    Direct Action\n   </em>\n   opinion did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   state that the defense of standing must be raised in an answer as though it were one of the defenses itemized in Rule 8(c). What this Court actually noted in\n   <em>\n    Direct Action\n   </em>\n   was that the issue of standing \"was\n   <em>\n    never raised before the trial justice\n   </em>\n   and, therefore, [was] * * * waived.\"\n   <em>\n    Direct Action\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11809224\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/713/218/\">\n    713 A.2d at 222\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The whole thrust of the\n   <em>\n    Direct Action\n   </em>\n   opinion with respect to the waiver of the defense of lack of standing was that the trial justice had not been alerted to that issue at any time; the opinion makes no reference whatsoever to Rules 8(c) or 12(h) or to what must be included in a responsive pleading.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11809224\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/713/218/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Moreover, even assuming\n   <em>\n    arguendo\n   </em>\n   that the defense of lack of standing constitutes an affirmative defense under Rule 8(c) (even though it is not specifically mentioned therein), it is nonetheless our view that Homeland's raising said defense in its motion for summary judgment was sufficient in view of the totality of what transpired in the Superior Court.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Industrial National Bank v.

Christy's argues that it has standing under the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act to pursue a declaration to the effect that Mr. Lanoie's insurance policy with Homeland covers the damages to Christy's own rental vehicle and to the Dean and Flynn trailer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act states:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   \"Any person interested under a deed, will, written contract, or other writings constituting a contract, or whose rights, status, or other legal relations are affected by a statute, municipal ordinance, contract, or franchise, may have determined any question of construction or validity arising under the instrument, statute, ordinance, contract, or franchise and obtain a declaration of rights, status, or other legal relations thereunder.\" General Laws 1956 \u00a7 9-30-2.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   This Court held in\n   <em>\n    Bowen v.

Because Christy's lacked standing to pursue its declaratory judgment action against Homeland, Homeland was indeed entitled to judgment as a matter of law, and the hearing justice properly granted Homeland's motion for summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Christy's does not remain without a remedy; the tort action currently pending\n   against Mr. Lanoie offers Christy's a procedurally proper avenue to pursue the damages to which it believes it is entitled.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Mendez\n   </em>\n   , 849 A.2d at 331 n.2 (stating that \"an injured party lacks standing to maintain a direct action for damages against a tortfeasor's insurer\n   <em>\n    until and unless\n   </em>\n   the injured party has secured a judgment against the tortfeasor\") (emphasis added).
