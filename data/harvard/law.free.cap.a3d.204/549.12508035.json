Claimant obtained that position through a union hall in Delaware.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18. The position in Delaware was temporary and Claimant understood that, once his work was completed, the assignment would end and he would be laid off.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 52. Claimant's pay rate for carpentry work in Delaware was approximately $ 28 per hour.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17. Although Claimant previously worked at the Delaware facility in 2013 and 2014, he was required to obtain a security clearance and identification (ID) badge prior to commencing work at that location in 2016.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 40.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On February 9, 2016, Claimant was building a scaffold when he reached for and missed a railing.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 21.

A temporary employee who works at one of Employer's other locations would not automatically have the same credentials to work at the Delaware facility as \"[i]t's a completely different job.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 24. The rate paid to temporary employees is the trade rate for the State of Delaware.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 17. Once the project is complete, temporary employees are laid off and there is no guaranteed length of employment.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 19, 34. Claimant was hired for such a project through the Delaware union hall.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 18.

As for the first clause, Claimant argues that Employer has a facility in Pennsylvania and he regularly worked at, or from, that facility. As for the third clause, Claimant argues that he is domiciled in Pennsylvania and spent a substantial part of his working time in Employer's Pennsylvania facility.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further Claimant maintains that he had an ongoing employment relationship with Employer through his work in Marcus Hook, Pennsylvania, and that his position at the Delaware facility was not a new contract of hire, but rather \"little more than an extension of [Claimant's] ongoing relationship with Employer.\" Claimant's Br. at 25. Claimant asserts any work performed for other employers in 2015 was \"\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 23.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Essentially, Claimant argues his 2015 work in Marcus Hook created an ongoing employment relationship. The job at Employer's Delaware facility was an extension of that relationship, and, consequently, his employment was principally localized in Pennsylvania. Claimant contends the relationship with Employer was such that Employer\n   specifically sought his services for the Delaware facility, a circumstance which made Claimant a\n   <em>\n    de facto\n   </em>\n   employee.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In response, Employer denies Claimant's job at the Delaware facility was part of an ongoing employment relationship. Rather, Claimant's position at the Delaware facility was separate and distinct from prior work performed for Employer, as Claimant was required to take a pre-employment drug screening test, submit to a background security check, participate in site-specific training in Delaware, and complete and sign new employee paperwork that was completed at the Delaware facility. Claimant's work was performed exclusively in Delaware, and he was paid the Delaware trade rate, which is different from the Pennsylvania rate for such work. Employer maintains Claimant understood that, once the project for which he was hired had been completed, Claimant would be laid off. Employer argues these facts support a conclusion that Claimant's employment was principally localized in Delaware.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Claimant cites two cases to support his assertion that he had an ongoing employment relationship with Employer, however, they are readily distinguishable.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The first is\n   <em>\n    Taylor v.

When Claimant's job in Marcus Hook ended on December 31, 2015, Claimant was not paid again by Employer until he was hired for a different job two weeks later. Claimant's new hire forms filled out prior to commencing the job in Delaware are indicative of his status as a new employee. When Claimant was laid off by the Delaware facility, he was required to return his ID badge.

The Board affirmed. On appeal to this Court, Greenawalt asserted that, although injured in New York, he was hired and trained in Pennsylvania.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . He also argued that jurisdiction was proper in Pennsylvania because he previously completed over 30 jobs for Bristol in Pennsylvania.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6960473\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/91/305/#p311\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   This Court affirmed the Board. While Greenawalt worked under a contract made in Pennsylvania, where he also resided and received training prior to working in New York, Greenawalt worked exclusively at the Rochester, New York, job site at the time he was injured until he was laid off.\n   <em>\n    Greenawalt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6960473\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/91/305/#p311\">\n    91 A.3d at 309\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

This Court agreed with the WCJ that no continuous employment relationship with Bristol could exist where Greenawalt's employment was on a per-job basis, followed by breaks in employment during which he worked for a different employer before being re-hired by Bristol.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Here, Claimant's work for Employer is similar to that of the claimant in\n   <em>\n    Greenawalt.\n   </em>\n   Claimant performed several distinct jobs for Employer. Each of those jobs was separated by periods of time during which Claimant was laid off. Claimant worked for other employers during some of those periods of layoff, and he cites no relevant legal authority which suggests \"\n   <em>\n    de minimis\n   </em>\n   \" work for a different employer should be ignored in our analysis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   In concluding that jurisdiction lay in Delaware, the WCJ considered the work Claimant performed for Employer in Pennsylvania, but he determined these jobs were short-term, job-site specific and \"completely different\" from the job in Delaware.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   WCJ Decision at 8\n   <em>\n    .\n   </em>\n   Claimant's employment in Pennsylvania ended in December 2015 when he was laid off.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6960473\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/91/305/#p311\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The job in Delaware constituted a new employment relationship with Employer.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6960473\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/91/305/#p311\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Having reviewed all the testimony and weighed the evidence, the WCJ concluded Claimant was injured while working for Employer in the State of Delaware and his employment was principally localized at Employer's place of business in Delaware. WCJ Decision, F.F. Nos. 12, 14. These findings of fact were based on the credible testimonies of Mr. Hufford and Mr. File, which the WCJ adopted as fact.

Consequently, Claimant has not established his work for Employer was part of a continuous period of employment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   As stated earlier, jurisdiction only lies in Pennsylvania under Section 305.2(a)(1) if\n   <em>\n    at the time of injury\n   </em>\n   a claimant's employment is principally localized in Pennsylvania. 77 P.S. \u00a7 411.2(a) (emphasis added).
