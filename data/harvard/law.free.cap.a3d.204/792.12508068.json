The petitioner\n   claims on appeal that the habeas court improperly rejected his claim that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing (1) to call a toxicologist as an expert witness in order to present an adequate intoxication defense and (2) to object to improprieties in the prosecutor's closing arguments. We affirm the judgment of the habeas court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts, as set forth by this court in affirming the petitioner's judgment of conviction, and procedural history are relevant to our disposition of the petitioner's appeal. \"In early February, 2009, the [petitioner] and the victim, Sholanda Joyner, were involved in a romantic relationship. The two had known each other since they were children, and had dated intermittently during the preceding eleven years. The victim's relationship with the [petitioner] was, as the victim's sister described it, 'dysfunctional ....'\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \"Several days before February 5, 2009, the [petitioner] went to the victim's apartment on Woolsey Street in New Haven and encountered two of her male acquaintances. A physical altercation between the two men and the [petitioner] ensued, and the [petitioner] was forcefully ejected from the victim's apartment. Shortly thereafter, the [petitioner] purchased a revolver for the purpose of killing the two men. The [petitioner] returned to the victim's apartment the next morning and encountered the individuals who had assaulted him the previous day. After displaying the revolver, the [petitioner] took their money, cell phones, and some drugs....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \"On February 5, 2009, the victim appeared, crying ... at her father's doorstep. Approximately two minutes later, the [petitioner] arrived and demanded that the victim leave with him. Over the protests of the victim's stepmother, the [petitioner] grabbed the victim by the arm and pulled her out the door. Later that evening, at the home of the victim's grandmother, the victim was crying and pleading with the [petitioner] to leave her alone. The [petitioner] again commanded the victim to depart with him, and the two left.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   \"After leaving the house of the victim's grandmother at approximately 11 p.m., the [petitioner] and the victim walked to the victim's apartment. Along the way, the victim stopped and purchased some ecstasy pills and phencyclidine (PCP). The victim and the [petitioner] smoked the PCP while en route to the victim's apartment. After arriving at the victim's home, the [petitioner] and the victim went into the victim's bedroom, and both of them ingested ecstasy. At some point, the [petitioner] retrieved a revolver and asked the victim if she had 'set [him] up ....' The [petitioner] then fired one gunshot into her head, intentionally killing her....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"The [petitioner] was arrested and charged with murder in violation of [General Statutes] \u00a7 53a-54a (a), and carrying a pistol or revolver without a permit in violation of [General Statutes] \u00a7 29-35 (a). At trial, the [petitioner] testified and admitted that he shot the victim. He claimed, however, that the gun had fired accidentally. The jury found the [petitioner] guilty of both charges. The court subsequently sentenced him to a total effective term of sixty years in prison.\" (Footnote omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ross\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=151%20Conn.%20App.%20687\">\n    151 Conn.

The essence of the petitioner's argument is that this failure constituted deficient performance because the jury needed expert testimony to understand the scientific basis underlying the petitioner's intoxication defense and to properly determine whether the effects of the drugs he ingested could affect his ability to form the intent needed for a murder conviction. We are unpersuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The following additional facts, as found by the habeas court, are relevant to the resolution of this claim. \"[Trial counsel] consulted with an expert witness ... Caroline Easton, [Ph.D,] about the influence that ingestion of ecstasy ... and [PCP] typically exerts on people and may have exerted on the petitioner, in particular.... Easton was ready to testify at the petitioner's criminal trial that the illicit drugs consumed by the petitioner before the shooting can cause vivid delusions and visual and auditory hallucinations....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \"[Trial counsel] encountered an unexpected problem at the criminal trial in establishing a foundation for ... Easton's testimony. The difficulty arose because the petitioner altered his version of events surrounding the shooting when he spoke to the state's expert and on the witness stand at his trial from that which he discussed with ... Easton. The petitioner's later description attributed the firing of the weapon to an accidental discharge as he was attempting to put his pistol down rather than as the result of drug-induced derangement of his perceptions about his environment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   This description conflicted with that which the petitioner had recounted to ... Easton.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \"[Trial counsel] asked ... Easton to remain in attendance at the courthouse in case the petitioner's testimony reflected his earlier recitation .... However, once the petitioner ascribed the firing of the gun as purely the result of the accidental mishandling of the weapon, [trial counsel] chose to release ... Easton.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The habeas court concluded that trial counsel's decision not to call Easton\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   to testify did not amount to deficient performance, stating that trial counsel's \"assessment of the nonutility of [Easton's] testimony [was] within the realm of competent legal assistance. It is commonly understood that juries look askance at alternative defenses such as, 'I didn't do it, but if I did do it, I have a good excuse.' \" We agree with the habeas court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   \"[T]here is no requirement that counsel call an expert when he has developed a different trial strategy.\"\n   <em>\n    Stephen J.
