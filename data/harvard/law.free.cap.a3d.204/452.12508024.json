The officer turned westbound onto Main Street and moments later the vehicle's left turn signal activated and the vehicle turned into a field on property belonging to a church. The driver, later identified as [Appellant], stopped the vehicle in the grass in front of the church's office building. Officer Byrne pulled behind the vehicle [without activating the overhead lights or siren on her police cruiser]. [Appellant] turned off the vehicle and he and a female passenger got out. The female passenger approached Officer\n   Byrne and told the officer that she had been giving [Appellant] directions on how to get to her home and he had turned too soon.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-12\">\n   Officer Byrne requested identification from [Appellant] and the passenger and had them return to [Appellant's] vehicle. The officer returned to her patrol car and learned that [Appellant's] driver's license had been suspended for driving-under-the-influence-related offenses. [Although not immediately, at some point during the encounter, Officer Byrne turned on her spotlight.]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   The officer returned to [Appellant's] vehicle and he admitted to knowing his license had been suspended. During this interaction, Officer Byrne detected an odor of alcohol coming from inside the vehicle and observed that [Appellant's] eyes were glassy. [Appellant] told the officer he had had two shots about two hours before. Based on the results of field sobriety tests and a preliminary breath test that showed the presence of alcohol, Officer Byrne arrested [Appellant] for suspicion of driving under the influence. [Appellant] agreed to a chemical test of his breath, which showed a blood alcohol concentration of .161 percent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-14\">\n   The Commonwealth charged [Appellant] with driving under the influence and related offenses. He filed a motion to suppress, which the [trial] court denied after a hearing [on August 28, 2017. Following the hearing, Appellant] proceeded to a stipulated bench trial, at which he was found guilty of one count of driving under the influence, high rate.... Later that day, [the trial] court sentenced [Appellant] to 1-5 years in prison for the DUI offense\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-15\">\n   [Appellant] filed a timely post-sentence motion, seeking application of the Recidivism Risk Reduction Incentive (\"RRRI\"). [The trial] court granted the motion. [Appellant] then filed a timely notice of appeal and, after being appointed new counsel and granted an extension of time, complied with [the trial] court's directive to produce a concise statement of errors under [Pa.R.A.P.] 1925(b).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Trial Court Opinion, 12/22/17, at 1-3 (original footnotes and unnecessary capitalization omitted, footnotes added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Appellant raises the following issues for our review:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   I. Whether the police had reasonable suspicion or probable cause which merited following Appellant's vehicle. Whether reasonable suspicion or probable cause existed to justify the search and seizure of the Appellant. Whether all evidence derived from the illegal stop and seizure must therefore be suppressed as fruit of the poisonous tree.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   II. Appellant challenges the illegal intrusion on the grounds that Officer Byrne alleges that she thought Appellant's car may have been disabled or the passenger experiencing a medical issue where such a belief was unreasonable under the circumstances and a mere pretext for an illegal stop, detention and seizure or Appellant's person and property.

In its brief, the Commonwealth asserts that the trial court correctly determined that the initial interaction between Officer Byrne and Appellant was a mere encounter until she smelled alcohol, at which time she developed a reasonable suspicion of DUI, thereby warranting an investigative detention.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   To secure the right of citizens to be free from unreasonable search and seizure, courts in Pennsylvania require law enforcement officers to demonstrate ascending levels of suspicion to justify their interactions with citizens to the extent those interactions compromise individual liberty.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

For this purpose, courts in Pennsylvania have defined three types of police interaction: a mere encounter, an investigative detention, and a custodial detention. A mere encounter is characterized by limited police presence, and police conduct and questions that are not suggestive of coercion. Such encounters do not obligate the citizen to stop or respond and, consequently, need not be supported by any level of suspicion.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"716460,9347887\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/814/1196/\">\n      id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Thus, the hallmark of a mere encounter is that the subject is free to decline to interact with the police or to answer questions, and is also free to leave at any time.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

To decide whether a seizure has occurred, a court must consider all the circumstances surrounding the encounter to determine whether the demeanor and conduct of the police would have communicated to a reasonable person that he or she was not free to decline the officer's request or otherwise terminate the encounter.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Strickler\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 890 (\"holding that courts must consider the totality of the circumstances when determining whether a seizure occurred.\").

Pointing to Officer Byrne's suppression testimony that she observed no vehicle code violations while she was following Appellant, he argues that there was no probable cause or reasonable suspicion to support the vehicle stop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The trial court concluded that Officer Byrne's \"stop was initiated as a mere encounter to determine the status of the vehicle that pulled off into a field of private property at 3:30 a.m. ...

In so ruling, the trial court credited Officer Byrne's testimony that she suspected that there was car trouble or a medical issue, purportedly invoking the community caretaking doctrine. However, as our Supreme Court explained in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Livingstone\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , \"the issue of whether an individual has been seized is distinct from the issue of whether that seizure was reasonable.

It is only after a seizure has occurred that a court must determine whether the community caretaking doctrine is invoked to validate as reasonable a seizure under state and federal constitutional warrant requirements.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   We disagree with the trial court's determination that Officer Byrne's initial interaction with Appellant was a mere encounter. \"The pivotal inquiry is whether, in light of the facts and circumstances ..., a reasonable man, innocent of any crime, would have thought he was being restrained had he been in the defendant's shoes.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Livingstone\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 621 (cleaned up).

Here, Officer Byrne conceded that she observed no vehicle code violations, and that Appellant was not speeding, stayed within the lanes of traffic, appropriately used his turn signal, and properly slowed for the turn into the church field. N.T. Suppression, 8/28/17, at 39. She articulated no facts to support a reasonable suspicion that criminal activity was afoot prior to blocking Appellant's vehicle. Thus, the evidence would clearly support the finding that Officer Byrne's interaction with Appellant was from its inception an investigative detention unsupported by a reasonable, articulable belief that Appellant was engaged in criminal activity. Accordingly, we will proceed to determine whether the seizure was otherwise justified under the public servant exception of the community caretaking doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Officer Byrne testified that she took obstructive action based on her belief that Appellant's \"car was disabled or maybe they were having some type of medical issue going on.\" N.T.

As noted previously, in order for the public servant exception to apply, Officer Byrne must have been able to point to specific, objective, and articulable facts that would reasonably suggest to an experienced officer that a citizen is in need of assistance.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Livingstone\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     supra\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 636 (\"[A] critical component of the community caretaking doctrine is that the police officer's action be based on specific and articulable facts which, viewed objectively and independent of any law enforcement concerns, would suggest to a reasonable officer that assistance is needed\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Appellant maintains that Officer Byrne \"failed to indicate how the observable behavior and actions of the individuals in the car would have led her to the conclusion that there was a medical emergency.\" Appellant's\n   brief at 23.

Appellant argues that \"[s]ince Officer [Byrne] admitted the stop was made before she had a reason to suspect there was criminal activity afoot ... and that she physically blocked his egress and ability to freely leave even though there was no reasonable suspicion or probable cause to do so, and the community caretaking function does not apply, suppression of the evidence is appropriate.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 28-29.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Based on our review of Officer Byrne's suppression testimony, we are unable to find any articulation of specific, objective facts that would reasonably suggest that either Appellant or his female passenger was in need of assistance.
