C.S. \u00a7 761(c), to conduct an appellate review of the County's appeal from an OOR Final Determination ruling on a request by ALDEA for records of the County. For the reasons that follow, we grant OOR's first and second preliminary objections and ALDEA's first preliminary objection, dismiss Counts I and II of the petition for review and transfer Count III to the Court of Common Pleas of Berks County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On July 27, 2017, ALDEA filed a request with the County pursuant to the Right-to-Know Law\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (RTKL) identifying six categories of records that it sought from the County related to the Berks County Residential Center (BCRC), an immigrant family detention facility. (OOR Certified Record (C.R.) Item 1.) In Items 1 to 4 of the request, ALDEA sought correspondence concerning complaints by or related to four private attorneys and one paralegal that related to conditions at BCRC. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) In addition, Item 5 of the request sought video recordings of the BCRC visitation area on the evening of May 23, 2017, while Item 6 of the request sought any correspondence between BCRC and any other party regarding the identified attorneys and paralegal. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On September 22, 2017, the County responded to ALDEA, asserting that it lacked any documents responsive to Items 1, 4 and 5 of the request and that Item 6 of the request was insufficiently specific to allow the County to respond. (C.R. Item 1.) With respect to Items 2 and 3 of the Request, the County stated that, to the extent any such documents existed, they would be exempt from disclosure because they related to a non-criminal investigation, related to internal, pre-decisional deliberations of an agency, were protected by the attorney-client privilege or constituted attorney work product. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Notwithstanding its responses, the County produced certain records to ALDEA that were not identified as being responsive to any specific item in ALDEA's request. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   )\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   ALDEA appealed the County's failure to produce responsive records to the OOR. (C.R. Item 1.) During the course of the appeal, the OOR Appeals Officer requested an exemption log as to the nine records withheld with respect to Item 2 of the request. (C.R. Item 6.) In its exemption log, the County objected to the disclosure of the records on the basis that they contained internal, pre-decisional deliberations and were protected by the attorney-client privilege. (C.R. Item 7.) The Appeals Officer then issued an order requiring that the County submit these nine records for\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review. (C.R. Item 9.) The order provided that pursuant to OOR's interim procedural guidelines, the records would be stored in a secure location and would not be \"disclosed to any person other than the appeals officer, the Executive Director or OOR staff counsel.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) The County objected to this order, raising arguments that OOR lacks the authority to issue\n   <em>\n    sua\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    sponte\n   </em>\n   orders requiring the submission of documents for\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review and that the review of such documents by non-lawyer OOR staff would be unlawful; nevertheless, the County ultimately submitted the records as ordered by the Appeals Officer.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   (C.R. Items 10, 12.) The County also raised the argument during the proceedings before the Appeals Officer that OOR lacked jurisdiction over ALDEA's appeal because Section 406 of the act commonly known as The County Code\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   governed access to the minute books and other fiscal records of a county and the RTKL was therefore inapplicable. (C.R. Items 4, 7, 10, 12, 16.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On February 9, 2018, the Appeals Officer issued a Final Determination that denied in part and granted in part ALDEA's appeal. The Appeals Officer concluded that the County had demonstrated that no records exist responsive to Items 1, 4 and 5 of the Request, Item 6 of the Request is insufficiently specific and that certain records responsive to Item 2 were protected by the attorney-client privilege or reflected internal, pre-decisional deliberations and were thus exempt. (Final Determination at 6-12, 15-16.) The Appeals Officer granted ALDEA's appeal in part, finding that other requested documents responsive to Item 2 of the Request were not protected by privilege or otherwise exempt under the RTKL and therefore were required to be produced to ALDEA. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11-15.) In addition, the Appeals Officer ruled that Section 406 of The County Code did not bar the release of documents because that provision does not explicitly state that county records are not subject to public access under the RTKL and, in any event, the requested records are not fiscal records as to which Section 406 applies. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5-6.) The County sought reconsideration of the Final Determination, which was denied on February 23, 2018. On March 11, 2018, ALDEA filed an appeal from the Final Determination in the Court of Common Pleas of Berks County.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The County filed this petition for review on March 9, 2018, identifying OOR and ALDEA as respondents and asserting three counts. Counts I and II are claims for declaratory relief. In Count I, the County seeks a declaratory judgment that the provision in The County Code allowing for access to meeting minutes and fiscal documents is in conflict with the RTKL and therefore, pursuant to Section 3101.1 of the RTKL, 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.3101.1,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The County Code preempts the RTKL with respect to public records requests made to counties. Count II seeks declaratory judgment and injunctive relief with respect to OOR's\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review practices based on claims that OOR lacks authority under the RTKL to issue an order requiring that records be submitted for\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review\n   <em>\n    sua sponte\n   </em>\n   and that the practices violate the legislative scheme set forth in the RTKL and the Supreme Court's exclusive authority to regulate the practice of law under the Pennsylvania Constitution. In Count III, the County requests that the Court invoke its ancillary jurisdiction to review the County's appeal of the Final Determination in conjunction with this\n   Court's consideration of the County's two original jurisdiction claims. In that appeal, the County raises the same argument as it does in Count I, that OOR erred by ruling that The County Code does not preempt the RTKL.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   OOR filed three preliminary objections to the petition for review. In the first objection, OOR argues that Count I should be dismissed because the County has an adequate statutory remedy under the RTKL of an appeal to the court of common pleas in which it can argue that The County Code preempts RTKL requests to counties. The second objection is a demurrer to Count II. Finally, OOR objects to certain statements in paragraph 59 of the petition for review on the grounds that they are scandalous and impertinent matter.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   ALDEA filed five preliminary objections. Three of these objections are to Count III of the petition. First, ALDEA argues that this Court lacks jurisdiction to consider Count III and that it will not serve judicial economy to consider the County's appeal here as ALDEA already filed an appeal in the Court of Common Pleas of Berks County. Second, ALDEA challenges Count III for insufficient specificity of pleading. Third, ALDEA asserts that the County has failed to exhaust its statutory remedy with respect to Count III of appealing the Final Determination to the court of common pleas. ALDEA also filed an objection to Count I in the nature of a demurrer, arguing that the County's sweeping view of The County Code preempting RTKL requests to counties fails as a matter of law. Finally, ALDEA argues that it was improperly joined as a party to this action because OOR is the true party in interest and ALDEA has no role in providing redress to the County.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   We first address OOR's preliminary objection to Count I of the petition for review based on the failure to exhaust the statutory remedy under the RTKL of an appeal of a Final Determination to the court of common pleas. It is undisputed that this Court has original jurisdiction over claims against OOR for declaratory relief. 42 Pa.

Furthermore, the County asserts that Count I falls within the exceptions to the doctrine of exhaustion of statutory remedies because it is challenging OOR's jurisdiction to adjudicate disputes concerning access to county records.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Upon review, we conclude that Count I does not fall into the class of disputes that would allow this Court to assume original jurisdiction over the claim and bypass the traditional appeal to the court of common pleas of an OOR determination concerning the records of a local agency. Subsequent to the briefing of the preliminary objections and oral argument in this matter, the General Assembly enacted Act 154 of 2018,\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   which includes extensive revisions to The County Code, including Section 406. At the time that the petition for review was filed, Section 406 provided in full:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   (a) The minute book and other fiscal records and documents of every county may be open to the inspection of any taxpayer thereof, but the proper officers may make reasonable rules and regulations respecting the time of such inspection.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   (b) In case any officer shall refuse to permit the inspection of any fiscal record or document the taxpayers may, by petition to the court of common pleas of the county, set forth his reasons for desiring to make such inspection, and, if the court deems such reasons proper, it shall order the officer to permit the inspection to be made.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   <em>\n    Former\n   </em>\n   16 P.S. \u00a7 406.

(Petition for Review \u00b6 47.) As a result of Act 154, however, there is no longer a need for this Court to consider this prospective declaratory relief as the General Assembly has determined that the RTKL will apply to records requests to counties from December 23, 2018 onward.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Indeed, the County has conceded\n   that the RTKL applies to records requests to counties after Act 154 went into effect and that the declaratory relief it seeks would have to be limited to requests submitted prior to the effective date.

Here, there is no claim that there is a proceeding against the County pending before OOR over which OOR lacks jurisdiction or that there was such a proceeding before OOR at the time that the County filed the petition for review. Rather, the OOR proceeding had already ended with the Final Determination and denial of reconsideration prior to the County filing the petition to review. Moreover, there is no possibility of the same jurisdictional challenges to future OOR proceedings because, as a result of Act 154, the law is clear that records requests directed at counties are subject to the RTKL and that OOR has jurisdiction over appeals from denial of such requests.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Thus, the only statutory remedy to be exhausted here is an appeal in the court of common pleas. No challenge, however, is asserted to the court of common pleas' jurisdiction to rule on the issue that is the subject of Count I, whether the former version of Section 406(a) of The County Code removed records requests against counties from the scope of the RTKL. To the contrary, the County expressly asserts\n   that the courts of common pleas have jurisdiction under Section 406 of The County Code to adjudicate disputes over records requests directed at counties.

Under the RTKL, OOR appeals officers are responsible for adjudicating appeals from local and Commonwealth agency denials of records requests, conducting hearings, making evidentiary rulings and issuing final determinations. 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.1102(a) (setting forth appeals officer duties to request evidence from the requester and agency, rule on procedural matters, hold hearings, make evidentiary rulings and issue final determinations on behalf of OOR);\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Section 1310(a)(5)(ii) of the RTKL, 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.1310(a)(5)(ii) (stating that appeals officers shall hold hearings as necessary to ensure the remedies provided for under the RTKL).

Pursuant to the RTKL, the Executive Director \"shall ensure that the duties of [OOR] are carried out and shall monitor cases appealed to [OOR].\" 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.1310(e).

In particular, we explained that while the Executive Director is vested with administrative responsibilities as head of OOR, these functions are incidental to the Executive Director's core statutory obligation to directly supervise and oversee OOR's unique \"quasi-judicial duty\" in adjudicating disputes arising under the RTKL concerning access to agency records.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 387. We concluded that \"the\n   Executive Director has the responsibility and power to exercise a quasi-judicial duty,\" and \"the Executive Director is part and parcel of the OOR's quasi-judicial mandate.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   In addition, the RTKL provides that OOR may appoint additional staff to fulfill the statutory duties of the RTKL. The RTKL states that the Executive Director \"shall appoint ... additional clerical, technical and professional staff as may be appropriate and may contract for additional services as necessary for the performance of the executive director's duties.\" 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.1310(d). The RTKL also specifically sets forth among the duties of appeals officers to \"[c]onsult with agency counsel as appropriate\" to further their role in resolving RTKL disputes. 65 P.S. \u00a7 67.1102(a)(3).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Thus, the RTKL not only provides that the Executive Director shall directly oversee the adjudicative role fulfilled by OOR appeals officers, but the Executive Director also has authority to appoint other staff members \"as appropriate\" to meet the statutory obligations of the RTKL, and the RTKL explicitly foresees that OOR appeals officers will consult with agency counsel in the furtherance of their role in adjudicating RTKL appeals. Accordingly, it is evident that the RTKL sets forth a legislative scheme allowing for the close supervision of the appeals officers' handling of their cases by the Executive Director and the support of other staff to assist the appeals officers in the completion of their duties, including counsel that can provide advice on legal matters when necessary and appropriate. The County's interpretation of the RTKL as isolating appeals officers from other OOR personnel in their role in adjudicating RTKL disputes and not letting them consult with agency counsel or the Executive Director is contrary to the RTKL and our decision in\n   <em>\n    Arneson\n   </em>\n   . While the RTKL does not specifically state that the Executive Director, staff counsel or other OOR employees may review\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   records, an agency is not foreclosed from taking any action that is not specifically authorized by the text of a statute. \"[A]n administrative agency is vested with the implied authority necessary to the effectuation of its express mandates, because the Legislature cannot foresee all the problems incidental to the agency's carrying out its duties and responsibilities.\"\n   <em>\n    Center Township\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6930656\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/95/354/#p369\">\n    95 A.3d at 369\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (quoting\n   <em>\n    Sewer Authority of the City of Scranton v.

In that decision, we rejected the argument by a local agency that the Supreme Court's exclusive authority to regulate the practice of law deprives OOR of subject matter jurisdiction from rendering decisions with respect to whether a document submitted for\n   <em>\n    in camera\n   </em>\n   review is protected by the attorney-client privilege, attorney work product doctrine or Rule of Professional Conduct 1.6(a), which prohibits a lawyer from disclosing confidential information regarding the representation of a client without the client's informed consent.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6930656\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/95/354/#p369\">\n    95 A.3d at 363-65\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . While recognizing that it would be error for OOR to order the production of records that are protected from disclosure by an applicable privilege or Rule 1.6(a), we concluded that \"when the OOR exercises\n   subject matter jurisdiction and determines whether a request is covered by the attorney-client privilege, the work product doctrine, or the ethics-based rule of confidentiality, the OOR does not infringe upon the Supreme Court's authority under Article V, Section 10(c).\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6930656\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/95/354/#p369\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   at 365 ;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission v.

While the RTKL provides that the Executive Director may supervise the adjudicative function of the OOR and may appoint other staff, including other attorneys, to assist appeals officers in the completion of their duties, nowhere in the RTKL does it provide that the opinion of non-attorney OOR personnel will supersede that of an appeals officer regarding a determination of privilege.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   Because the claims asserted in Count II fail as a matter of law, we sustain OOR's demurrer to Count II. The only remaining claim in the petition for review following the dismissal of Counts I and II is Count III. In Count III, the County requests that this Court exercise ancillary jurisdiction pursuant to Section 761(c) of the Judicial Code over the County's appeal from OOR's determination in the Final Determination that The County Code does not preempt the applicability of the RTKL with respect to ALDEA's request to the County for records related to the BCRC facility. Pursuant to Section 761(c), ancillary jurisdiction is proper \"over any claim or other matter which is related to a claim or other matter otherwise within its exclusive original jurisdiction.\" 42 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 761(c). Because we have dismissed Counts I and II, however, we now lack original jurisdiction claims to which Count III could be ancillary. As Count III was filed in this Court, but we lack jurisdiction to dispose of this claim, Count III must be transferred to \"the proper court of this Commonwealth,\" the Court of Common Pleas of Berks County, where that court may hear the County's appeal of the OOR Final Determination in conjunction with ALDEA's previously filed appeal.

Counts I and II are dismissed. Because both of the original jurisdiction claims are dismissed from this action, we may not assert ancillary jurisdiction over Count III under Section 761(c) of the Judicial Code and therefore we sustain ALDEA's first preliminary objection asserting a lack of jurisdiction over Count III.
