On April 12, 2017, the Agency filed a dependency petition and a petition for temporary custody of Child. In its dependency petition, the Agency stated that Father and Mother (collectively, Parents) have a protracted history with the Agency.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Dependency Pet., 4/12/17, at Allegations of Dependency \u00b6 F.

Due to Parents' failure to attend the hearing, the court permitted counsel for Parents to withdraw. On May 1, 2017, Judge Hoberg entered a shelter care order finding it was not in the best interest of Child to return to the Parents' home, legal and physical custody should remain with the Agency, and visitation should continue as scheduled, subject to a negative drug screen.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Shelter Care Order, 5/1/17. The order included an attachment, which notified Parents that their respective attorneys had withdrawn their appearances due to their failure to appear at the hearing.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Specifically, the attachment included a notation indicating that Father was served individually.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   The attachment further directed Parents to make an appointment to re-qualify for counsel for their next scheduled hearing if they wished to have counsel represent them at said hearing.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   We have included the order and attachment below.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   On May 2, 2017, the Honorable Thomas B. Sponaugle conducted a dependency hearing. Parents failed to attend, and no counsel appeared on Parents' behalf. At the hearing, Ross testified as to the averments in the dependency petition.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   N.T., 5/2/17, at 5-16. Ross further testified that the \"Agency continue[d] to have concerns with substance abuse as this has been an ongoing issue for the family,\" Child's hygiene, and Parents' inability to provide for Child's needs or maintain a\n   stable environment.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 8. She stated that there were also some concerns that Child could have a mental health issue, but that Parents did not address those concerns.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 11-12.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Ross stated that there were aggravating circumstances due to Parents' parental rights being involuntarily terminated as to J.U.2.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 5, 9. She explained that Parents were given a child permanency plan as to J.U.1 and J.U.2 and that they did not complete the objectives.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   8-9. She added that the concerns that led to the placement of J.U.1 and J.U.2 had not been alleviated.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 11. Ross indicated that she attempted to discuss the permanency plan for Child with Parents but could not reach them by phone or in person at their apartment.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 9. She testified that she was able to speak with Parents on May 1, 2017, the day before the hearing, when she personally served them with the notice of the hearing and they indicated that \"they would come early to discuss the case with me.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 9-10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Ross further testified that during the time of the Agency's involvement with J.U.1 and J.U.2, Parents told the Agency that Child lived with maternal grandmother.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 10. She stated that had the Agency known that Child was actually residing with Parents it would have sought to place Child at the same time as it placed J.U.1 and J.U.2.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Finally, Ross stated that Child is adjusting well in the new resource home with maternal aunt.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 15. Child is very excited to have his own bed and his own space.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Child \"also had indicated to me that he did not feel safe going outside of where he was living with [P]arents, so he enjoys being able to play in the driveway and being able to play in a yard.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Currently, Child is placed with his two youngest siblings and has visitation with the rest of his siblings as maternal grandmother and aunt have a close relationship.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at 14.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On May 4, 2017, Judge Sponaugle entered an order adjudicating Child dependent, maintaining his placement in foster care, setting his permanency goal as adoption, and terminating Father's visitation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Order, Adjudication and Disposition, 5/4/17.

It states that it is common that parents fail to appear for hearings despite receiving proper notice.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Further, the Agency asserts that requiring the court to continue hearings until the parents appear in person and then inquire into their desire to have counsel will significantly delay the completion of six-month permanency hearings required by 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6351(e).\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Id.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Section 6337 of the Juvenile Act recognizes that \"there exists in parents a right to counsel in dependency cases,\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     In re N.B.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9366018\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/817/530/#p535\">\n    817 A.2d 530\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 535 (Pa.

In the instant case, the provisions of Rule 1152, governing the waiver of counsel do not apply because the central inquiry on these facts is not waiver, but whether Father was aware of the hearing, and of his right to counsel at the hearing; and whether he applied for counsel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   Father does not dispute that he received notice of the dependency hearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   In fact, there is sufficient evidence of record that Father was aware of the hearing.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Shelter Care Order, 5/1/17;\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     see also\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   N.T., 5/2/17, at 9-10.

In particular, Section 6337 of the Juvenile Act provides that \"\n   <strong>\n    a party is entitled to representation by legal counsel at all stages of any proceedings under this chapter\n   </strong>\n   and if he is without financial resources or otherwise unable to employ counsel, to have the court provide counsel for him.\" 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 6337 (emphasis added).

(\"Father\"), at a shelter care hearing. An attached notice informed Father that appointed counsel would represent him at the shelter care hearing only, and provided Father an address and telephone number he could use to seek further legal representation. The April 12, 2017 order indicates that it was served on Father and Father's appointed counsel. Counsel appeared at the April 18, 2017 shelter care hearing, but Father did not. Counsel then successfully moved for withdrawal but did not inform Father. At oral argument before this Court, counsel represented that she believed the Lancaster County Children and Youth Social Service Agency would notify Father of her withdrawal. The May 1, 2017 shelter care order notified Father that his counsel had withdrawn and directed Father to make an appointment at the Office of Bail Administration if he wished to have counsel at the next scheduled hearing. Father could not have made any such appointment, because the next scheduled hearing took place\n   <strong>\n    the following morning\n   </strong>\n   , at 8:30 a.m. on May 2, 2017. Father failed to attend the May 2, 2017 hearing,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   no counsel appeared on Father's behalf, and the trial court entered the orders presently on appeal. In these circumstances, I would conclude that the trial court failed to enforce Father's statutory right to counsel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   I believe the plain language of 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 6337, read in conjunction with the applicable procedural rules,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   is dispositive. \"When the words of a statute are clear and free from all ambiguity, the letter of it is not to be disregarded under the pretext of pursuing its spirit.\" 1 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 1921(b).\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-95\">\n   The purpose of statutory interpretation is to ascertain the General Assembly's intent and give it effect.

Relatedly, it is well established that resort to the rules of statutory construction is to be made only when there is an ambiguity in the provision.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     In re Adoption of L.B.M.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12278587\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/639/428/\">\n    639 Pa. 428\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12278585,12278587,12316973,12316966\" index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/161/172/\">\n    161 A.3d 172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 179 (2017) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The first sentence of Section 6337\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   gives a party a statutory right to counsel at all stages of a dependency proceeding. That right is not conditioned on a party's request or a party's appearance at a proceeding. The second sentence of Section 6337 requires the court to ascertain whether a parent who appears at a proceeding unrepresented is aware of the right to counsel. It does not, either expressly or impliedly, require a parent to appear at a proceeding before the right to counsel attaches. Section 6337 is silent on the effect of a party's failure to appear at a proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Rule 1151(E) governs the trial court's obligations when no counsel enters an appearance for a party, or when an unrepresented party requests counsel. Neither scenario occurred here. Rather, appointed counsel entered an appearance on Father's behalf prior to the first proceeding. The Majority's reliance on and analysis of Rule 1151(E) is therefore misplaced. Rule 1151(E), like Section 6337, is silent on the effect of a parent's failure to appear or request counsel. All three sentences of Rule 1151(E) state what the court \"shall\" do.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     e.g.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     L.B.M.\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12278585,12278587,12316973,12316966\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/161/172/\">\n    161 A.3d at 179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (noting that the use of \"shall\" in 23 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 2313(a) of the Domestic Code was an unambiguous mandate). Rule 1151(E) imposes obligations on the court, not a party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   The real issue in this case is the propriety and the procedure regarding counsel's withdrawal after only one proceeding. Rule 1152, governing waiver of the right to counsel, does not state that a parent's failure to appear at a proceeding or procure counsel for a subsequent proceeding, in accordance with the instructions of a preprinted document, constitutes a knowing, intentional, and voluntary waiver of the right to counsel. Rather, the official comment to Rule 1152 recommends inquiry into whether (1) the party understands the right to counsel; (2) whether the party understands the dependency allegations; (3) whether the party is aware of the potential outcomes of a dependency proceeding; (4) whether the party understands that he or she must obey the rules of procedure regardless of the presence or absence of counsel; (5) whether the party understands that counsel may be better suited to defend the party against the allegations; and (6) whether the party understands the potential to waive rights and objections. Pa.R.J.C.P. 1152, comment. I understand that the official comment to a\n   Rule is nonbinding, but I find it very problematic that Father's failure to comply with the trial court's notices provides no answers to\n   <strong>\n    any\n   </strong>\n   of these six questions.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because Rule 1152 imposes an affirmative obligation on the court to determine whether a parent's waiver of counsel is knowing, intelligent, and voluntary, it is clear that no valid waiver of counsel occurred in this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   In summary, the trial court failed to enforce Father's statutory right to counsel according to the plain statutory terms, and failed to conduct a valid waiver colloquy. Instead, the trial court elevated local practice over statutory law. This Court must not condone local practices that subvert statutory rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Furthermore, I disagree with the Majority's prompt resolution analysis. Majority Opinion at 961-62 (citing 42 Pa.C.S.A. \u00a7 6351(e)(3), Pa.R.J.C.P. 1404(A), 1409(B), and 1510 ). Proper enforcement of Father's right to counsel would not have delayed this proceeding. Had Father's appointed counsel remained on the case she could have represented Father's interests at the May 2, 2017 hearing, regardless of his presence or absence. In the meantime, the court could have instructed counsel to attempt to contact Father, and act accordingly in response to counsel's report on Father. This would have protected Father's statutory right to counsel with no attendant delay. If appropriate, the trial court could have issued orders identical to those on appeal at the conclusion of the May 2, 2017 hearing with or without Father's participation. Again, the real issue, insofar as Father's right to counsel is concerned, is the trial court's lack of statutory authority to permit counsel's withdrawal on the facts before us. The Majority's conclusion that the trial court would have had to await Father's action apparently rests on its misreading of Rule 1151(E). As I explained above, that Rule imposes obligations on the trial court, not a party, and it does not govern here because counsel was appointed and entered an appearance prior to the first proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Finally, I note that the United States Supreme Court has recognized that \"[t]he fundamental liberty interest of natural parents in the care, custody, and management of their child does not evaporate simply because they have not been model parents or have lost temporary custody of their child to the State.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Santosky v.
