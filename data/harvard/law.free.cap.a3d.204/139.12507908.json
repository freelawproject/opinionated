The case now stands before us, twenty years after the murder of the victim, seventeen-year-old high school senior Hae Min Lee (\"Ms. Lee\"). We review the legal correctness of the decision of the post-conviction court and decide whether certain actions on the part of Respondent's trial counsel violated Respondent's right to the effective assistance of counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <strong>\n    FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   We shall not endeavor to replicate the thorough, carefully-written and well-organized Opinion, penned by then-Chief Judge Patrick Woodward, of the Court of Special Appeals in this case.

Mr. Syed challenged his conviction on direct appeal. In an unreported opinion, the Court of Special Appeals affirmed his conviction on March 19, 2003.\n   <em>\n    Syed v. State\n   </em>\n   , No. 923, Sept. Term 2000. On May 28, 2010, Mr. Syed filed a petition for post-conviction relief, which he supplemented on June 27, 2010. In that petition, Mr. Syed alleged that he received ineffective assistance of counsel and in so alleging lodged claims against his trial counsel, sentencing counsel, and appellate counsel. In the post-conviction petition, Mr. Syed argued nine bases for his claim that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel.\n   <em>\n    Syed\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12494730\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/181/860/\">\n    236 Md.

Of relevance to our inquiry is that none of the nine bases was a claim that his trial counsel failed to challenge an alleged\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   violation regarding the admission of evidence that potentially undermined the reliability of cell tower location evidence that was used as part of the State's case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Mr. Syed did raise and\n   argue that his trial counsel was ineffective for failing to investigate or call Asia McClain (\"Ms. McClain\") as an alibi witness. After a two-day hearing on October 11, 2012 and October 25, 2012, the post-conviction court issued an order and memorandum in which it denied post-conviction relief on January 6, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Thereafter, Mr. Syed filed a timely application for leave to appeal, which presented the issue of his trial counsel's failure to interview or investigate Ms. McClain as a potential alibi witness.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Subsequent to his filing of an application for leave to appeal, Mr. Syed supplemented his application for leave to appeal and requested that the Court of Special Appeals remand the case for the post-conviction court to consider an affidavit from Ms. McClain.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The intermediate appellate court granted Mr. Syed's request and issued a limited remand order in which it afforded Mr. Syed \"the opportunity to file such a request to re-open the post-conviction proceedings\" in the Circuit Court.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Syed\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12494730\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/181/860/\">\n    236 Md.

Mr. Syed continued to maintain his argument that his trial counsel's failure to pursue Ms. McClain as an alibi witness amounted to ineffective assistance of counsel. The Circuit Court granted Mr. Syed's request to reopen his post-conviction proceedings to review both of the aforementioned issues.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   After a five-day hearing, the post-conviction court issued an order, accompanied by a thorough memorandum, in which it denied relief to Mr. Syed on the issue of his counsel's failure to investigate Ms. McClain as an alibi witness. The post-conviction court concluded that although Mr. Syed's trial counsel was deficient for not contacting Ms. McClain, counsel's failure to investigate Ms. McClain's claim did not prejudice Mr. Syed. Next, the post-conviction court concluded that Mr. Syed waived his claim of a\n   <em>\n    Brady\n   </em>\n   violation with respect to the cell tower location evidence because he had not raised the claim in his post-conviction petition. Finally, with respect to Mr. Syed's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel concerning his trial counsel's failure to challenge the cell tower\n   location evidence, the post-conviction court first determined that Mr. Syed did not knowingly and intelligently waive this claim. Then, the post-conviction court reasoned that Mr. Syed's trial counsel's failure to challenge the cell tower information was in fact deficient and that this deficiency prejudiced Mr. Syed. As a result, the post-conviction court vacated the convictions and granted Mr. Syed a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In its review of the post-conviction court's order, the Court of Special Appeals reversed the rulings in two respects. With regard to the claim that Mr. Syed suffered ineffective assistance of counsel due to his trial counsel's failure to investigate a potential alibi witness, the Court of Special Appeals applied the tenets of\n   <em>\n    Strickland v. Washington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    466 U.S. 668\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    80 L.Ed.2d 674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1984), and concluded that Mr. Syed's trial counsel's performance was deficient and that this deficiency resulted in prejudice. Specifically, the intermediate\n   appellate court determined that Mr. Syed was prejudiced by the absence of Ms. McClain's testimony because of the State's timeline of the murder and the fact that the State was required to prove that Mr. Syed caused the death of the victim in order to secure a conviction for first-degree murder.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12494730\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/181/860/\">\n    236 Md.

The court explained that, \"the State had to establish that [Mr.] Syed 'caused the death' of [Ms. Lee], and the State's theory of when, where, and how [Mr.] Syed caused [Ms. Lee's] death was critical to proving this element of the crime.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12494730\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/181/860/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   The court characterized the State's case as a circumstantial one that \"did not directly establish that [Mr.] Syed caused [Ms. Lee's] death sometime between 2:15 p.m. and 2:35 p.m. in the Best Buy Parking lot on January 13, 1999.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12494730\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/181/860/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12494730\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/181/860/\">\n    at 282\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12494730\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/181/860/\">\n    181 A.3d at 916\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . By contrast, according to the intermediate appellate court, Ms. McClain's testimony would have been evidence that could have supplied \" 'reasonable doubt' in at least one juror's mind leading to a different outcome[.]\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12494730\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/181/860/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12494730\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/181/860/\">\n    at 284\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12494730\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/181/860/\">\n    181 A.3d at 918\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   the intermediate appellate court ruled that because Mr. Syed had previously raised the issue of ineffective assistance of\n   counsel in his petition for post-conviction relief, he was precluded from raising the issue again on a totally different ground, namely, the cell tower location ground.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12494730\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/181/860/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12494730\" index=\"20\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/181/860/\">\n    at 237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12494730\" index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/181/860/\">\n    181 A.3d at 890\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

The cell tower ground was not one of those grounds. Consequently, the question of waiver regarding the failure to raise the issue of ineffective assistance of trial counsel is not present here.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12494730\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/181/860/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12494730\" index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/181/860/\">\n    at 236-37\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12494730\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/181/860/\">\n    181 A.3d at 890\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Court of Special Appeals further held that the theory relative to the reliability of the cell tower location evidence was a non-fundamental right, and, as such, Mr. Syed's failure to assert this ground in his post-conviction petition constituted a waiver.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12494730\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/181/860/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12494730\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/181/860/\">\n    at 239\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12494730\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/181/860/\">\n    181 A.3d at 892\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

According to Mr. Syed, it was a dereliction of duty\n   for trial counsel to make no effort to contact Ms. McClain. This is so because, according to Mr. Syed, trial counsel did not raise an alibi defense. Moreover, Mr. Syed argues that because Ms. McClain's alibi was offered for a precise time it was even more crucial for trial counsel to investigate her, and there is no tactical consideration that could have justified a failure to contact Ms. McClain. Finally, Mr. Syed suggests that Ms. McClain was a disinterested witness whose testimony would have \"punctured both the 'when' and the 'where' of the State's core theory[,]\" and, therefore, would have created reasonable doubt as to Mr. Syed's involvement to satisfy the prejudice prong of\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The State, of course, seeks a reversal of the Court of Special Appeals on the issue of trial counsel's efforts to investigate Ms. McClain as an alibi witness. According to the State, the record here is silent as to trial counsel's reasons or motivations for not investigating Ms. McClain and, without more, Mr. Syed cannot satisfy his burden under\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   . The State contends that a proper application of\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   in the face of a silent, ambiguous or incomplete record as to trial counsel's reasons requires that a court deny relief based on the presumption that trial counsel acted reasonably. Here, according to the State, there were several plausible explanations for why Mr. Syed's trial counsel did not need to investigate Ms. McClain's purported alibi. Ultimately, the State concludes that Mr. Syed has failed to show that his trial counsel's performance satisfied the second prong of\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   because the State presented \"overwhelming evidence of [Mr. Syed's] guilt.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    Trial Counsel's Duty to Investigate\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   The Sixth Amendment affords an individual accused of a crime the right to effective assistance of counsel.

Trial counsel's failure to investigate or inquire into whether Ms. McClain might aid Mr. Syed's defense did not meet the standard of reasonable professional judgment. Mr. Syed's trial counsel failed to even contact Ms. McClain.

We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   At a minimum, due diligence obligated Mr. Syed's trial counsel to contact Ms. McClain in an effort to explore her potential as an alibi witness. An attorney cannot be said to be carrying out the ABA's requirement of due diligence without conducting a factual investigation of an alibi witness who claims to have knowledge of the defendant's whereabouts on the day of the crime in question. Even if Mr. Syed's trial counsel knew what facts Ms. McClain would present about seeing Mr. Syed on January 13, 1999, trial counsel should have nevertheless made a bona fide effort to investigate Ms. McClain. An investigation could have verified Ms. McClain's assertions as well as revealed whether Ms. McClain was a disinterested witness. Our conclusion does not change in spite of the \"heavy measure of deference to counsel's judgments\" required by\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   .\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"135\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    466 U.S. at 687, 691\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"136\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    104 S.Ct. at 2064, 2066\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"137\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    80 L.Ed.2d 674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Where a defendant provides his or her counsel with information about an alibi witness, the attorney has an affirmative duty to make reasonable efforts to investigate the information that was provided. Thus, the performance of an attorney who clearly failed to effectuate her duty to investigate a potential alibi witness, or provide a reasonable explanation for not investigating the witness, would be deficient under\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   In the present case, Mr. Syed gave trial counsel the name and address along with facts about the testimony the potential witness would offer. Mr. Syed's trial counsel had received this information and, therefore, had a duty to investigate Ms. McClain as a potential alibi witness. By all accounts, trial counsel did not conduct any inquiry of Ms. McClain. Trial\n   counsel neither confirmed Ms. McClain's statements, nor indicated in her case file the reasons why she did not investigate Ms. McClain's background or alibi. Mr. Syed's trial counsel's task list dated September 4, 1999\n   indicated that one task was to \"[m]ake determination regarding alibi[,]\" and a hand-written \"urgent\" appeared next to this entry. We are mindful of\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   's wisdom that \"[r]epresentation is an art, and an act or omission that is unprofessional in one case may be sound or even brilliant in another.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"138\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    466 U.S. at 693\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"139\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    104 S.Ct. at 2067\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"140\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    80 L.Ed.2d 674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Documentation, though, is not an art. To the extent that an attorney documents the steps of his or her investigation is a reflection of that attorney's minimal competence and\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   a reflection of trial strategy. If trial counsel had interviewed Ms. McClain and decided that the information Ms. McClain had about Mr. Syed's whereabouts on the afternoon of January 13, 1999 was not helpful to Mr. Syed's case, a notation in the file indicating as much would have plainly defeated Mr. Syed's argument on his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.

Moreover, trial counsel's failure to attempt to contact the witness prior to trial did not constitute a reasonable tactical or strategic decision because it was not based upon an adequate investigation of the facts.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v. Borchardt\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3517717\" index=\"144\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/396/586/#p604\">\n    396 Md. 586\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 604,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3517717\" index=\"145\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/396/586/#p604\">\n    914 A.2d 1126\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1136 (2007). Although trial counsel was not available, as a result of her death, to testify at the post-conviction proceedings to explain why she did not attempt to make a reasonable investigation\n   of Ms. McClain's background or alibi, her case file notes were admitted into evidence during those proceedings. Her notes, however, did not explain why the investigation of Ms. McClain was unnecessary or why she failed to ascertain whether Ms. McClain's testimony would aid the defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Our holding is limited to the narrow question of whether trial counsel was deficient for failing to\n   <em>\n    investigate\n   </em>\n   Ms. McClain as an alibi witness. Because we conclude that counsel was deficient for failing to\n   <em>\n    investigate\n   </em>\n   Ms. McClain, we need not and do not hold that trial counsel was deficient for failing to\n   <em>\n    call\n   </em>\n   Ms. McClain as an alibi witness at trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The State strongly advocates that we adopt a broad bright-line rule that would never allow a defendant to prevail on the deficiency prong of the\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   test in the absence of trial counsel's reasoning for his or her failure to investigate an alibi witness. According to the State, \"where the record is silent-or even just incomplete or ambiguous-proper application of\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   's presumption of competence requires that a court deny relief.\" Applied here, the State's reasoning is grounded in the fact that Mr. Syed's trial counsel was unable-due to her death-to explain why she did not contact Ms. McClain as part of trial preparations. Therefore, according to the State, Mr. Syed could not have met, and did not meet, the high burden that\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   demands. The State would have this Court rule that whenever a record is silent as to the reasons why trial counsel failed to investigate a potential alibi witness, the defendant may never prevail on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim because a reviewing court could not declare trial counsel's performance deficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   A ruling such as this would divorce this Court from its obligation to review the totality of the circumstances of ineffective assistance claims through the lens of an \"objective standard of reasonableness.\"\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"146\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    466 U.S. at 687-88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"147\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    104 S.Ct. at 2064\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"148\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    80 L.Ed.2d 674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"When a convicted defendant complains of the ineffectiveness of counsel's assistance, the defendant must show that counsel's representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.

The State focused primarily on Mr. Syed's actions on the evening of January 13, 1999. During the six-hour period from approximately 2:00 p.m. after school dismissed to approximately 8:00 p.m., the State's strongest evidence against Mr. Syed related to the period of time Mr. Syed was involved in burying Ms. Lee's body in Leakin Park and the subsequent abandonment of Ms. Lee's car. The State relied on the testimony of Jay Wilds (\"Mr. Wilds\") to establish that Mr. Syed buried the victim in Leakin Park at approximately 7:00 p.m. Mr. Wilds testified that Mr. Syed received two calls to his cell phone during the time that Mr. Syed was preparing the burial site for the victim's body. The State introduced Mr. Syed's cell phone records to corroborate Mr. Wilds's testimony. The cell phone records showed that Mr. Syed's cell phone received two incoming calls, one at 7:09 p.m. and one at 7:16 p.m. The State's expert testified that the cell towers where the calls were received connected with cell sites that encompassed Leakin Park, which is where Ms. Lee's body was discovered. The State also relied on the testimony of Jennifer Pusateri (\"Ms. Pusateri\"). Ms. Pusateri's testimony served to corroborate the fact of the incoming call at 7:09 p.m. or 7:16 p.m. as well as to place Mr. Syed and Mr. Wilds together at the time of that call. Ms. Pusateri testified that she received a message from Mr. Wilds to call him, so she tried to reach him using the number that was on her caller I.D. from his message. When she called and asked to speak with Mr. Wilds, the person who answered the phone responded that Mr. Wilds was busy and would call her back. The State proved that the number Ms. Pusateri called was the number for Mr. Syed's cell phone. About ten to fifteen minutes after that call, according to Ms. Pusateri, she met Mr. Wilds in a parking lot where she saw Mr. Wilds get out of a car that Mr. Syed was driving.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Additionally the State presented evidence that this was a crime of premeditation and deliberation. For example, through\n   Mr. Wilds's testimony, the State established that Mr. Syed told Mr. Wilds on January 13, 1999, hours before the murder, referring to Ms. Lee, \"I'm going to kill that bitch.\" According to Mr. Wilds,\n   while he and Mr. Syed were standing near the victim's car in the Best Buy parking lot, Mr. Syed showed Mr. Wilds the victim's body in the trunk and boasted, \"I killed somebody with my bare hands.\" Also at that time, Mr. Wilds observed Mr. Syed wearing red gloves. Following this conversation, Mr. Syed directed Mr. Wilds to follow him, in Mr. Syed's car as Mr. Syed drove the victim's car, to a Park and Ride on Interstate 70. Thereafter, according to Mr. Wilds, Mr. Syed said that he needed to return to school so that he could be seen at track practice. They left the victim's car parked at the Park and Ride and drove back to Mr. Syed's school in his car.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   In her discovery responses, Mr. Syed's counsel presented a theory that Mr. Syed had a routine of attending track practice after school followed by attending prayer service at his mosque. On October 4, 1999, Mr. Syed's trial counsel issued an alibi notice to the State, in which she stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-67\">\n   On January 13, 1999, Adnan Masud Syed attended Woodlawn High School for the duration of the school day. At the conclusion of the school day, the defendant remained at the high school until the beginning of his track practice.\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   After track practice, Adnan Syed went home and remained there until attending services at his mosque that evening. These witnesses will testify as to the defendant's regular attendance at school, track practice, and the Mosque; and that his absence on January 13, 1999 would have been noticed.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   The notice also included the names of over eighty individuals who would testify as to Mr. Syed's routine involving track practice and the Mosque.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Md.

This alibi notice to the State was consistent with the statements Mr. Syed had made to the police on prior occasions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   On the evening of January 13, 1999, Officer Scott Adcock spoke with Mr. Syed inquiring about Mr. Syed's knowledge of the whereabouts of Ms. Lee. At that time, Mr. Syed told Officer Adcock that \"he was suppose[d] to get a ride home from the victim, but he got detained at school and felt that she just got tired of waiting and left.\" Mr. Syed did not provide Officer Adcock with an explanation of what detained him or what he did after school. Two weeks after the initial conversation with Officer Adcock, Mr. Syed was interviewed by Detective O'Shea on January 25, 1999. At that time, Mr. Syed said that he had attended track practice after school on January 13, 1999. Detective O'Shea spoke with Mr. Syed again on February 1, 1999 to ask him if he remembered telling Officer Adcock that Ms. Lee was waiting to give him a ride after school. At that time, Mr. Syed told Detective O'Shea that \"[Officer Adcock's information] was incorrect\n   because he drives his own car to school so he wouldn't have needed a ride from her.\" When Mr. Syed was interviewed on February 26, 1999, he told investigators that he could not remember what he did on January 13, 1999. Although Mr. Syed offered conflicting statements to law enforcement about needing a ride after school, the conflict in those statements was not inconsistent with whether he attended track practice that day.\n   In his post-conviction petition, Mr. Syed relied on Ms. McClain's contention that she observed him in the Woodlawn Public Library on the afternoon of January 13, 1999. Specifically, Ms. McClain averred in her 2015 affidavit that she saw Mr. Syed between 2:30 p.m. and 2:40 p.m. and had a conversation with him at that time. In assessing Ms. McClain's value as an alibi for Mr. Syed, her letters tended to show that Mr. Syed and the victim were not together between 2:30 p.m. and 2:40 p.m. on January 13, 1999.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   Even taking Ms. McClain's statements as true, her alibi does little more than to call into question the time that the State claimed Ms. Lee was killed and does nothing to rebut the evidence establishing Mr. Syed's motive and opportunity to kill Ms. Lee. Thus, the jury could have disbelieved that Mr. Syed killed Ms. Lee by 2:36 p.m., as the State's timeline suggested, yet still believed that Mr. Syed\n   had the opportunity to kill Ms. Lee after 2:40 p.m. Ms. McClain's testimony, according to her affidavit, failed to account for Mr. Syed's whereabouts after 2:40 p.m. on January 13, 1999. Likewise, Mr. Syed's statements to the police fail to account for his whereabouts after 2:15 p.m. when school let out. Therefore, even if the alibi testimony had been admitted into evidence it could not have affected the outcome of the case because that evidence did not negate Mr. Syed's criminal agency.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   To conclude that Mr. Syed allegedly suffered prejudice as a result of his trial counsel's deficient performance, we must determine in light of all of the evidence before the jury, that \"there was a substantial or significant possibility\" that the jury's verdict would have been affected by the deficient performance.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bowers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2042613\" index=\"189\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/320/416/#p426\">\n    320 Md. at 426\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2042613\" index=\"190\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/320/416/#p426\">\n    578 A.2d at 739\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Mr. Wilds testified that Mr. Syed had complained of Ms. Lee's treatment of him and said that he intended \"to kill that bitch.\" Mr. Wilds claimed to have seen the body of Ms. Lee in the trunk of her car at the Best Buy parking lot. Ms. Pusateri, a friend of Mr. Wilds, told police, and testified at trial consistent with those statements, that Mr. Wilds told her that Ms. Lee had been strangled. At the time Ms. Pusateri relayed this information to the police, the manner of Ms. Lee's death had not been publicly released. Mr. Syed's cell phone records showed him receiving a call in the vicinity of Leakin Park at the time that Mr. Wilds claimed he and Mr. Syed were there to bury Ms. Lee's body. Mr. Wilds directed the police to the location of Ms. Lee's abandoned vehicle, which law enforcement had been unable to find for weeks. Mr. Syed's palm print was found on the back cover of a map book that was found inside Ms. Lee's car; the map showing the location of Leakin Park had been removed from the map book. Various witnesses, including Ms. Pusateri, Nisha Tanna, and Kristina Vinson, testified to either seeing or speaking by cell phone with Mr. Wilds and Mr. Syed together at various times throughout the afternoon and evening on January 13, 1999.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   Given the totality of the evidence the jury heard, we conclude that there is not a significant or substantial possibility that the verdict would have been different had trial counsel presented Ms. McClain as an alibi witness. Ms. McClain would have been an alibi witness who contradicted the defendant's own statements, which were themselves already internally inconsistent; thus Ms. McClain's proffered testimony could have further undermined Mr. Syed's credibility. Moreover, Ms. McClain's account was cabined to a narrow window of time in the\n   <em>\n    afternoon\n   </em>\n   of January 13, 1999. Her testimony would not have served to rebut the evidence the State presented relative to Mr. Syed's actions on the\n   <em>\n    evening\n   </em>\n   of January 13, 1999. At best, her testimony would have highlighted Mr. Syed's failure to account precisely for his whereabouts after school on January 13, 1999. Trial counsel's deficient performance,\n   therefore, could not have prejudiced Mr. Syed in light of the totality of the evidence presented to the jury.\n   Ultimately, the post-conviction court reached the same conclusion as we do here. That court viewed Ms. McClain's testimony in light of \"the crux of the State's case\" which \"did not rest on the time of the murder.\" The post-conviction court reasoned that the State placed Mr. Syed in Leakin Park at approximately 7:00 p.m. on January 13, 1999 through the testimony of Mr. Wilds and the cell phone location evidence. With this theory in mind, the post-conviction court concluded that Ms. McClain's testimony \"would not have been able to sever this crucial link\" between Mr. Syed burying Ms. Lee's body and the State's evidence supporting that allegation. The Court of Special Appeals, however, disagreed with the post-conviction court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The intermediate appellate court suggested that the post-conviction court failed to consider that in order to convict Mr. Syed of first-degree murder, the State needed to prove that Mr. Syed \"caused the death\" of Ms. Lee.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12494730\" index=\"203\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/181/860/\">\n    236 Md.

Furthermore, the State proved that Mr. Syed had the motive and the opportunity to take Ms. Lee's life on January 13, 1999. As the post-conviction court noted in its first Memorandum Opinion,\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   \"[a]s a motive, the State presented evidence that [Mr. Syed]\n   was jealous and enraged at the victim's new romantic relationship with another man.\" The medical examiner determined that Ms. Lee had died by strangulation. The post-conviction court observed that the State established through Mr. Wilds's testimony that Mr. Syed \"called Mr. Wilds from a payphone ... at 2:36 p.m. on January 13, 1999 to request a ride.\" According to Mr. Wilds's testimony, Mr. Syed \"opened the trunk of the victim's car, revealing the victim's lifeless body ... told Mr. Wilds that he had strangled the victim and bragged, 'I killed someone with my bare hands.' \" The post-conviction court found that the \"State corroborated [Mr.] Wilds['s] testimony with [Mr. Syed's] cell phone records.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Finally, the post-conviction court observed that, \"the crux of the State's case did not rest on the time of the murder. In fact, the State presented a relatively weak theory as to the time of the murder because the State relied upon inconsistent facts to support its theory.\" In other words, the State did not rely on the time of the victim's murder as much as it relied on the substantial circumstantial evidence that pointed to Mr. Syed's motive and his transportation and burial of the victim's body to establish his guilt. In reaching its conclusion that Mr. Syed was not prejudiced by his trial counsel's failure to investigate Ms. McClain, the post-conviction court identified the State's testimonial evidence and the evidence used to corroborate that testimonial evidence, which, taken together, established Mr. Syed's motive and his opportunity to fatally strangle Ms. Lee. Ms. McClain's alibi provided evidence of Mr. Syed's whereabouts for a narrow period of time, whereas the State's case covered a much more expanded period of time on January 13, 1999. We agree with the post-conviction court, and in doing so, depart from the view of the Court of Special Appeals that the State's evidence failed to establish Mr. Syed's criminal agency.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Given our task of determining whether there is a \"substantial or significant\" possibility that the jury's verdict would have been affected, we consider the totality of the evidence.

Mr. Syed describes his ineffective-assistance claim variously as a separate, free-standing, factually distinct allegation of error that independently entitles him to relief. According to Mr. Syed, because the allegation of error he makes is premised on a fundamental right, the waiver provision in the post-conviction statute, as interpreted by\n   <em>\n    Curtis\n   </em>\n   , can only be waived intelligently and knowingly. Mr. Syed suggests that there is no sound reason for this Court to abandon the well-established, and frequently affirmed, precedent established by\n   <em>\n    Curtis\n   </em>\n   , which he argues, is that the right to counsel is sufficiently fundamental to require a knowing and intelligent waiver under the post-conviction statute. With respect to the holding of the Court of Special Appeals, Mr. Syed argues that the distinction that that court made between the issue of a violation of a fundamental right and the grounds supporting such a claim is a semantic distinction with no relevance. Finally, Mr. Syed points this Court to an analogous\n   context in federal law, the federal habeas exhaustion requirement. In that context, Mr. Syed argues that ineffective assistance claims with different factual predicates must be treated separately.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   The State responds to Mr. Syed's cross-petition urging this Court to affirm the Court of Special Appeals. The State points to a number of important distinctions between the facts of\n   <em>\n    Curtis\n   </em>\n   and Mr. Syed's case. The defendant in\n   <em>\n    Curtis\n   </em>\n   had never raised the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel in any prior court case.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Whereas in the present case, Mr. Syed set forth numerous grounds for finding ineffective assistance of counsel in his post-conviction petition. Additionally, the State argues that\n   <em>\n    Curtis\n   </em>\n   was decided when the General Assembly permitted a defendant to file an unlimited number of post-conviction petitions. Since\n   <em>\n    Curtis\n   </em>\n   , the Legislature has repeatedly circumscribed the number of post-conviction petitions that a person may file.

We point out that previously we have observed that the\n   purpose of the introduction of the doctrine of waiver in the UPPA \"was to achieve finality in the criminal adjudicative process, without unduly interfering with a defendant's right to fully present his case before a court.\"\n   <em>\n    Arrington v.

The Legislature's emphasis on bringing\n   <em>\n    all\n   </em>\n   cognizable claims in one and only one petition under the UPPA serves to underscore our holding. Mr. Syed's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel on the basis that his counsel failed to challenge the cell tower location evidence was waived because he did not raise that as a ground when advancing his ineffective assistance of counsel claim in his petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   We reject Mr. Syed's suggestion that the holding of\n   <em>\n    Curtis\n   </em>\n   applies to his case. Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Curtis\n   </em>\n   , Mr. Syed did not fail to raise a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in his petition for post-conviction relief. Mr. Syed advanced a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel and provided nine bases upon which that claim was premised. Those grounds were fully litigated at a hearing on October 11, 2012 and October 25, 2012. Whereas Mr. Curtis had not previously advanced his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, thus implicating the possibility that he had waived review of a fundamental right, that is not the scenario in the present case. The Court of Special Appeals reasoned:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-105\">\n   To extend\n   <em>\n    Curtis\n   </em>\n   's requirement of a knowing and intelligent waiver from the issue of ineffective assistance of counsel to every ground that could support such claim would run counter to the legislative history and purpose of Chapter 110 of the Acts of 1995, because it would allow a petitioner to raise claims of ineffective assistance of counsel on grounds not previously raised\n   <em>\n    ad infinitum\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   <em>\n    Syed\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12494730\" index=\"261\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/181/860/\">\n    236 Md.

The Legislature's various amendments to the UPPA, which have curtailed the filing of successive post-convictions petitions, support this conclusion. The Legislature unmistakably intended to discourage a post-conviction petitioner from failing to raise all claims, and the grounds or allegations supporting those claims, for post-conviction relief in one petition. When Mr. Syed advanced\n   a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in his one post-conviction petition under the UPPA but failed to assert all grounds upon which that claim is made, he waived any allegation upon which the ineffective assistance of counsel claim could have been made but was not. Permitting otherwise would result in an end-run around the UPPA's limit to one post-conviction petition and, importantly, the Legislature's intention to achieve finality in the context of post-conviction litigation.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, recognizing that the case of\n   <em>\n    Bahm v.

App. 2003), is only persuasive authority for us, we nevertheless observe that our holding in the present case is consistent with that of our brethren jurisdiction. In response to a petition for rehearing, the intermediate appellate court clarified its earlier opinion with regard to petitioner's request for post-conviction relief. In affirming its previous decision, the intermediate appellate court explained in a succinct opinion that upon remand issues that were previously waived \"as free-standing arguments\" may be raised as an argument supporting a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel with the caveat that \"for an argument to be available in post-conviction proceedings as a reason why counsel was ineffective, the petitioner must have raised such\n   <em>\n    ground\n   </em>\n   in his petition for post-conviction relief.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9100785\" index=\"264\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/794/444/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9100785\" index=\"264\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ne2d/794/444/\">\n    at 445\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   <strong>\n    CONCLUSION\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-108\">\n   For the reasons stated herein, we agree with the conclusion of the Court of Special Appeals that Mr. Syed's trial counsel's performance was deficient under the\n   <em>\n    Strickland v.

Thus, significantly, all of the Majority's comments on the performance prong are\n   <em>\n    dicta\n   </em>\n   because they are not necessary to the holding that Syed did not receive ineffective assistance of trial counsel,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the Majority's observations concerning trial counsel's alleged deficient performance and the need to contact the alleged alibi witness have no precedential value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   That said, given that the Majority addresses the performance prong, I will comment on the matter as well. Contrary to the majority opinion, I would hold that it is reasonable for a defendant's trial counsel to refrain from contacting a potential alibi witness where trial counsel already knows of the potential alibi witness's version of events, and it is reasonable for a defendant's trial counsel to refrain from calling a potential alibi witness where the potential alibi witness's testimony could prejudice the defendant by contradicting the defendant's pretrial statements to law enforcement officers, contradicting the defendant's trial counsel's reasonable choice of defense strategy, and/or otherwise appearing to be a fabrication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   Where a defendant's trial counsel has sufficient information to know of a potential alibi witness's version of events, it does not constitute deficient performance for the defendant's trial counsel to refrain from contacting the potential alibi witness to confirm what trial counsel already knows.

The circuit court found that, before trial, Syed gave McClain's letters to his trial counsel; and, in those letters, McClain described her alleged interactions with Syed on January 13, 1999-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the date on which Hae Min Lee was murdered. In her March 1, 1999 letter, McClain stated in pertinent part: \"I'm not sure if you remember talking to me in the library on Jan 13th, but I remembered chatting with you.... My boyfriend [ (Derrick Banks) ] and his best friend [ (Gerrod Johnson) ] remember seeing you there too.\" McClain mentioned \"the Woodlawn Public Library[,]\" thus making it clear that she was referring to the public library, not the school library.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   McClain identified a timeframe in the following sentence: \"I will try my best to help you account for some of your unwitnessed, unaccountable lost time (2:15 - 8:00; Jan 13th).\" In her March 2, 1999 letter,\n   McClain reiterated that, on January 13, 1999, she and Syed had allegedly spoken to each other in the public library.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   In addition to McClain's letters, notes from Syed's defense file demonstrate that his trial counsel was aware of McClain's version of events. Undated notes from Syed's defense file state: \"Asia + boy[ ]friend saw him in Library 2:15 - 3:15[.]\" Notes from Syed's defense file dated July 13, 1999 state: \"Asia McClain - saw him in the library @ 3:00[.]\" Immediately below that, the following language appears: \"Asia boyfriend saw him too[.]\" Under these circumstances, like the defendant's trial counsel in\n   <em>\n    Weaver\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1607888\" index=\"298\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/mont/327/441/\">\n    114 P.3d at 1044\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , Syed's trial counsel \"knew the possible accounts of exculpatory testimony that may have been solicited from\" a potential alibi witness. There is no indication in the record-or, indeed, any allegation whatsoever-that Syed's counsel would have gained any new material information by speaking to McClain. Indeed, in his brief, Syed acknowledges that his \"trial counsel knew what McClain would say[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-126\">\n   By determining that Syed's trial counsel needed to contact McClain, the Majority effectively purports to adopt a bright-line rule that a defendant's trial counsel must always contact every single potential alibi witness whom the defendant identifies before trial. Ironically, both Syed and the majority of the panel of the Court of Special Appeals have expressly denied that they have espoused such a bright-line rule-but that is essentially what the Majority has set forth. At oral argument, Syed's postconviction counsel claimed that Syed's position was not \"that there's a\n   <em>\n    per se\n   </em>\n   rule that, every time there's a[ potential] alibi witness, [he or] she must be contacted.\" Similarly, the majority of the panel of the Court of Special Appeals insisted that it did not \"say, or imply, that there is a bright[-]line rule with respect to ineffective assistance of counsel claims.\"\n   <em>\n    Syed v.

Can they come? What was the camera?\" As to the first question, Syed's trial counsel already knew who was with McClain; in her March 1, 1999 letter, McClain stated that Banks (her boyfriend) and Johnson (Banks's friend) also saw Syed in the public library. As to the second question, McClain could not have known for certain whether Banks and/or Johnson would be willing to testify on Syed's behalf. As to the third question, McClain was a high school student at the time, and thus could not have been expected to know how the public library's surveillance cameras functioned, or whether it would have been possible to retrieve any recordings from January 13, 1999. Further, at oral argument, the Special Assistant Attorney\n   General advised that, at the second postconviction hearing, a manager who had worked at the public library testified that recordings from the public library's surveillance cameras were maintained for only a matter of days. Under these circumstances, Syed clearly failed to rebut the presumption of reasonableness concerning trial counsel not contacting McClain.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   Having concluded that Syed has failed to rebut the presumption that it was reasonable for his trial counsel to refrain from contacting McClain, I would address the issue of whether Syed has rebutted the presumption that it was reasonable for his trial counsel to refrain from calling McClain as a witness at trial.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   In resolving that issue, I would hold that it is reasonable for a defendant's trial counsel to refrain from calling a potential alibi witness where his or her testimony could prejudice the defendant.

Syed's pretrial statements to law enforcement officers, and his trial counsel's reasonable choice of defense strategy, indicated that he was at track practice after school-and did not indicate, in any way, that he was at the public library after school. Additionally, there were several other obvious indications that McClain's version of events was false.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   In his pretrial statements to law enforcement officers, Syed mentioned being at track practice, but did not mention a library, and he made inconsistent statements. At the second trial, Officer Scott Adcock testified that, on January 13, 1999, Syed said that he had seen Lee at school earlier that day. According to Officer Adcock, Syed also said that Lee had been supposed to give him a ride home from school, but he had gotten held up, and presumed that she had gotten tired of waiting for him and left without him. At the second trial, Detective Joseph O'Shea testified that, on January 25, 1999, Syed said that, on January 13, 1999, he had been in a class with Lee from 12:50 p.m. to 2:15 p.m. According to Detective O'Shea, Syed also said that he had not seen Lee after school because he had gone to track practice. Detective O'Shea testified that, on February 1, 1999, he asked Syed whether he had told Officer Adcock that, on January 13, 1999, Lee had been supposed to give him a ride. According to Detective\n   O'Shea, Syed responded that that was incorrect because he had driven to school, and thus would not have needed a ride.\n   In other words, Syed made inconsistent pretrial statements to Officer Adcock and Detective O'Shea; he told Officer Adcock that Lee had been supposed to give him a ride, but he later told Detective O'Shea that Lee had not been supposed to give him a ride.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   Syed's pretrial statements to Officer Adcock and Detective O'Shea were inconsistent not only with each other, but also with McClain's version of events. If, as McClain testified at the second postconviction hearing, shortly after school ended, Syed went to the public library and spoke to McClain, then, contrary to his pretrial statement to Officer Adcock on January 13, 1999, he neither expected a ride home from Lee after school, nor missed that ride because he got held up. Additionally, as Syed's postconviction counsel acknowledged at oral argument, McClain's version of events was inconsistent with Syed's pretrial statement to Detective O'Shea on February 1, 1999, in that Syed failed to allege that he had gone to the public library after school on January 13, 1999. Syed had every incentive to be complete while volunteering to Detective O'Shea information about his whereabouts on the date on which Lee had gone missing, given that Syed knew that he was speaking to a detective, that Lee had been missing for more than two weeks, and that he was Lee's most recent ex-boyfriend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   Syed's trial counsel would have known of his pretrial statements to Officer Adcock and Detective O'Shea before the first trial. At the time of the second trial, Maryland Rule 4-263(b)(2)(B) stated: \"Upon request of the defendant, the State's Attorney shall ... [a]s to all statements made by the defendant to a State agent that the State intends to use at ... trial, furnish to the defendant ... the substance of each oral statement and a copy of all reports of each oral statement[.]\" In the absence of evidence to the contrary, we must presume that Syed's trial counsel and the prosecutors acted pursuant to former Maryland Rule 4-263(b)(2)(B) ; \"[t]here is a presumption of regularity [that] normally attaches to trial court proceedings, although its applicability may sometimes depend upon the nature of the issue before the reviewing court.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   <em>\n    Harris v. State\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3977159\" index=\"377\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/406/115/#p122\">\n    406 Md. 115\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 122,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3977159\" index=\"378\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/406/115/#p122\">\n    956 A.2d 204\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 208 (2008) (citations omitted). The record extract contains no evidence that rebuts the presumptions that Syed's trial counsel made, and that the prosecutors complied with, a request for records of all of Syed's pretrial statements to law enforcement officers. Additionally, Syed's trial counsel heard Officer Scott Adcock testify at the first trial. Thus, before the second trial, Syed's trial counsel necessarily knew of his pretrial statements to Officer Adcock.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-149\">\n   Consistent with Syed's pretrial statements to Officer Adcock and Detective O'Shea, his trial counsel chose a defense strategy of, among other things, establishing that he regularly attended track practice. The circuit court found the following facts regarding Syed's trial counsel's choice of defense strategy:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-150\">\n   [Syed's t]rial counsel engaged in a three[-]prong [defense] strategy at [the second] trial: (1) to prove that [Syed] and [Lee] ended their relationship amicably due to outside pressures and remained friends after the breakup, thereby challenging the State's suggested motive; (2) to show that the police hastily focused their investigation on [Syed,] and thus[ ] failed to pursue evidence that would have proven [his] innocence; and (3)\n   <strong>\n    to undermine [Jay] Wilds's version of the events by establishing [Syed]'s habit of attending track practice\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    after school\n   </strong>\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   and then reciting taraweeh prayers at the mosque during the month of Ramadan.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   (Emphasis added). In short, the circuit court expressly found that Syed's trial counsel pursued an alibi that was based on his daily routine, which included regular attendance of track\n   practice-and did not include regular attendance of the public library.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Syed's trial counsel's choice of defense strategy-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , pursuing an alibi that was based on his daily routine-was reasonable, given that Syed's pretrial statements to Officer Adcock and Detective O'Shea did not include information about going to the public library. Additionally, Syed's statements to his trial counsel and her law clerk demonstrated that his memory of his whereabouts after school on January 13, 1999 varied over time. At the first postconviction hearing, Syed testified that he had received McClain's letters within a week of being arrested on February 28, 1999. According to Syed, McClain's letters \"kind of fortified the memory that [he] had of after school\" on January 13, 1999. But, Syed testified that, after his trial counsel told him that \"nothing came of\" McClain's letters, he told his trial counsel \"that [he] didn't really have confidence that [he]'d be able to prove [that he] was somewhere else when [Lee's] murder [took] place[.]\" The undated notes from Syed's defense file indicate that he told his trial counsel's law clerk that McClain and Banks (her boyfriend) saw him in a library between 2:15 p.m. and 3:15 p.m. The notes from Syed's defense file dated July 13, 1999 indicate that he told his trial counsel's law clerk that McClain and Banks saw him in a library at 3:00 p.m. In a memorandum summarizing an August 21, 1999 interview with Syed, his trial counsel's law clerk stated that Syed \"believe[d that] he attended track practice on [January 13, 1999] because he remembers informing his coach that he had to lead prayers on Thursday.\" Attached to the memorandum summarizing the August 21, 1999 meeting with Syed was a handwritten account of his recollection of his whereabouts on January 13, 1999. In that document, Syed did\n   not write anything about his whereabouts after school on January 13, 1999. In sum, Syed's pretrial statements to Officer Adcock, Detective O'Shea, his trial counsel, and her law clerk demonstrate that he lacked a consistent memory of his whereabouts after school on January 13, 1999-which made it reasonable for Syed's trial counsel to focus on his daily routine rather than McClain's allegations about his whereabouts after school on that date in particular.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   This conclusion is supported by Syed's post-trial statements, which demonstrate\n   that, after the second trial, Syed could not remember his whereabouts after school on January 13, 1999. At the first postconviction hearing, Syed testified that, after the jury found him guilty on February 25, 2000, he told Rabia Chaudry, a family friend: \"I wish there was some way that I could [have] proved that I was somewhere else at [the] time\" of Lee's murder. Consistently, at the first postconviction hearing, Chaudry testified that, after the jury found him guilty, Syed stated that January 13, 1999 \"was like any other day for\" him, and that he did not \"have any specific recollection of that day[.]\" Syed's post-trial statements constitute additional evidence that, before trial, he failed to offer his trial counsel a consistent memory of his whereabouts after school on January 13, 1999.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   In stark contrast to Syed, McClain has claimed to remember his whereabouts after school on January 13, 1999. In her March 1, 1999 letter, McClain stated that, on January 13, 1999, at or after 2:15 p.m., she, Banks (her boyfriend), and Johnson (Banks's friend) saw Syed in the public library. Similarly, at the second postconviction hearing, McClain testified that, on January 13, 1999, she encountered Syed in the public library shortly after 2:15 p.m., and spoke to him for approximately fifteen to twenty minutes; afterward, Banks and Johnson approached Syed and McClain, and she and Banks left the public library.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   Because McClain's version of events contradicted Syed's pretrial statements to Officer Adcock and Detective O'Shea and his trial counsel's reasonable choice of defense strategy,\n   far from helping Syed's case, McClain's testimony could have given the jury reason to believe that McClain's version of events was a fabrication-and, worse still, reason to believe that Syed himself had come up with the fabrication himself. Such an inference would have been disastrous to Syed's case, as \"[m]any jurors regard a false alibi as an admission of guilt.\"\n   <em>\n    Henry v.

McClain's version of events was inconsistent with Syed's trial counsel's choice of defense strategy because the whole point of that strategy was to convince the jury that, given that Syed had a daily routine, he likely followed it on January 13, 1999-and McClain's version of events indicates that Syed deviated from his daily routine by going to the public library.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-160\">\n   Indeed, at oral argument, Syed's postconviction counsel acknowledged that going to the public library \"was not part of his regular routine.\" Similarly, the majority of the panel of the Court of Special Appeals noted that, if Syed had gone to the public library, he would have been \"deviating from his routine[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Syed\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12494730\" index=\"391\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/181/860/\">\n    236 Md.

In addition, however, to the indications of fabrication that were apparent at the second trial (such as Syed's failure to tell Officer Adcock or Detective O'Shea that he had been in the public library after school on January 13, 1999), Syed's trial counsel was privy to numerous other signs that McClain's version of events was false. These were signs of fabrication that could have led a reasonable lawyer in Syed's trial counsel's position to doubt the veracity of McClain's version of events, and could have prompted ethical concerns about suborning perjury by calling McClain as a witness.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   One sign of possible fabrication that was available to Syed's trial counsel is that, as far as the record extract reveals, outside of giving McClain's letters to his trial counsel, Syed told his defense team on only two occasions that he had been seen at a library, by merely conveying the information to his trial counsel's law clerk. The notes from Syed's defense file indicate that, on July 13, 1999 and another date, he told his trial counsel's law clerk that McClain and Banks (her boyfriend) had seen him in a library. The July 13, 1999 notes indicate that McClain and Banks had seen Syed at the library at 3:00 p.m. The undated notes from Syed's defense file state that McClain and Banks saw him in a library between 2:15 p.m. and 3:15 p.m. Given that the circuit court found that no one on Syed's defense team contacted McClain, the information\n   on the undated notes from Syed's defense file must have come from Syed himself. In light of the importance of Syed's whereabouts after school on January 13, 1999, a reasonable lawyer in Syed's trial counsel's position could have expected him to mention having been seen at a library more than two times and to have discussed the matter directly with trial counsel. Moreover, the notes do not allege that Syed ever told his defense team that he was, in fact, at a library on July 13, 1999, but only that Syed alleged that others had indicated that they had seen him there.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-163\">\n   Another sign of fabrication is that Syed's two references to the alibi during his meetings with his trial counsel's law clerk were inconsistent with each other. On July 13, 1999, Syed said that McClain and Banks had seen him at a library at 3:00 p.m. On another date, Syed said that McClain and Banks had seen him in a library between 2:15 p.m. and 3:15 p.m. A reasonable lawyer in Syed's trial counsel's position could have found it unusual that Syed pinpointed a specific time on one occasion, yet referred to a one-hour timeframe on another.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   Yet another sign of fabrication is that, in stark contrast to the two references to the library in the notes from Syed's defense file, the mention of the library is conspicuously absent from memoranda in which a member of Syed's defense team summarized meetings with him on August 21, 1999, October 9, 1999, and January 15, 2000. Attached to the memorandum summarizing the August 21, 1999 meeting with Syed was a handwritten account of his recollection of his whereabouts on January 13, 1999. In that document, Syed did not write anything about his whereabouts after 2:15 p.m.-much less allege that he had gone to a library around that time. According to the memorandum summarizing the October 9, 1999 meeting with Syed, he said that he and Lee had frequently gone to the parking lot of the Best Buy in Woodlawn to engage in sexual activity-but the memorandum does not say anything about Syed going to a library, frequently or otherwise. And, according to the memorandum summarizing the January 15, 2000 meeting with Syed, there were several\n   \"points [that] he wanted to make with regard to the first trial\"-none of which involved him being at a library.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   An additional sign of fabrication is that detectives' interview notes, which the prosecutors made available to Syed's trial counsel, indicated that two employees of Woodlawn High School said that Syed frequently visited the school library-as opposed to the public library, which is in a separate building next-door to Woodlawn High School. According to the employees, Syed and Lee went to the school library often, and multiple computers at the school library had internet access-which undermines Syed's testimony at the first postconviction hearing that, after school on January 13, 1999, he went to the public\n   library to check his e-mail. Additionally, according to the memorandum summarizing the January 15, 2000 meeting, Syed challenged Wilds's testimony's implication that he killed Lee on the side of the Best Buy, as he \"would not then walk all the way to the phone booth (it is a long walk[,] and [Syed] does not like walking).\" Syed did not challenge Wilds's account on the ground that he had been at the public library at the time of the murder, and was not responsible for the murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   Another sign of fabrication is that the notes from Syed's defense file do not specify which library he claimed to have visited on January 13, 1999-the school one, or the public one. Although the circuit court found that the notes from Syed's defense file dated July 13, 1999 indicated that he told his trial counsel's law clerk that McClain saw him in the public library, in actuality, the notes simply refer to \"the library[.]\" Similarly, the undated notes from Syed's defense file state that McClain and Banks \"saw him in Library[.]\" Immediately below that, the following language appears: \"Went to Library often[.]\" Even assuming that this language refers to Syed, as opposed to McClain and/or Banks, the undated notes from Syed's defense file do not specify the library to which Syed claimed to go often. It is possible that-consistent with his regular practice, according to the two employees of Woodlawn High School-Syed told his trial counsel's law clerk on two occasions that he had visited the school library after school on January 13, 1999-which would have contradicted both of\n   McClain's letters, in which she stated that she had seen him in the public library.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   An additional sign of fabrication is that, outside of McClain's and Syed's statements, the record extract contains no evidence that Banks (McClain's boyfriend) and/or Johnson (Banks's friend) ever told anyone else that they had seen Syed in the public library on the afternoon of January 13, 1999. Although McClain stated in her March 1, 1999 letter that Banks and Johnson indicated that they had seen Syed in the public library, McClain did not even mention Banks or Johnson in her March 2, 1999 letter, much less repeat her allegation that they had also seen Syed. Additionally, although the notes from Syed's defense file indicated that he told his trial counsel's law clerk on two occasions that McClain and Banks had seen him at a library, the notes from Syed's defense file do not indicate that he ever said that Johnson also saw him in a library.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Under these circumstances, a reasonable lawyer in Syed's trial counsel's position could have been suspicious of McClain's version of events, which lacked corroboration from anyone other than Syed-who obviously had a motive to be untruthful about his whereabouts after school on January 13, 1999 and who had not been consistent in accounting for his whereabouts on that date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   A further important sign of fabrication is that, assuming that McClain actually saw Syed in the public library on January 13, 1999, in her letters, she would not have used language that indicated that her version of events was untrue. In her March 1, 1999 letter, McClain stated in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-169\">\n   I hope that you're not guilty[,] and a I\n   <s>\n    want\n   </s>\n   hope to death that you have nothing to do with it. If so[,]\n   <strong>\n    I will try my best to help you account for some of your unwitnessed, unaccountable lost time (2:15 - 8:00; Jan 13th).\n   </strong>\n   The police have not been notified\n   <em>\n    Yet\n   </em>\n   to my knowledge[.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-170\">\n   M]aybe it will\n   give your side of the story a particle [sic] head start.\n   <strong>\n    I hope that you appreciate this,\n   </strong>\n   seeing as though I really would like to stay out of this whole thing.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   (Bolding added) (underlining in original) (paragraph break omitted). McClain also stated: \"If you were in the library for a[ ]while, tell the police[,] and I'll continue to tell what I know even louder than I am.\" This unusual language is indicative of an offer to provide a false alibi.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   Another sign of fabrication is that, in her March 1, 1999 letter, McClain referred to the nearly-six-hour timeframe of 2:15 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. That circumstance was unusual in light of Syed's statement to his trial counsel's law clerk that McClain had seen him in a library for only a fraction of that timeframe-namely, between 2:15 p.m. and 3:15 p.m.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   A final sign of fabrication is that detectives' notes regarding their April 9, 1999 interview of Ja'uan Gordon (a friend of Syed's) stated that Gordon said:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-174\">\n   ?\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   WROTE ME A LETTER. HE CALLED YESTERDAY, BUT I WASN'T HOME. WROTE ? BACK\n   <strong>\n    HE WROTE A LETTER TO A GIRL TO TYPE UP WITH HIS ADDRESS ON IT BUT SHE GOT IT WRONG\n   </strong>\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-175\">\n   <strong>\n    101 EAST EAGER STREET ASIA?\n   </strong>\n   12TH GRADE\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-176\">\n   I GOT ONE, JUSTIN A[D]GER GOT ONE\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   (Emphasis added) (capitalization in original). The detectives' notes constitute evidence that Syed wrote a letter to McClain and asked her to type it and include the address of the Baltimore Central Booking &amp; Intake Center, and that, as a result, McClain typed the letter and put an incorrect address on it. Specifically, McClain put on her March 2, 1999 letter the\n   address of 301 East Eager Street-which is an address that is associated with, but is not the main address of, the Baltimore Central Booking &amp; Intake Center.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   The circuit court discounted the possibility that Syed wrote a letter to McClain and asked her to type it, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-179\">\n   [T]o adopt the State's theory, the Court would have to assume that the \"Asia\" [who is] referenced by Gordon is McClain[,] as opposed to another individual who shares the same name. [The detectives'] notes are unclear as to the identity of this \"letter\"; Gordon could be referencing [McClain's] March 2, 1999 letter[,] or another letter altogether. With respect to the \"wrong address,\" the Court is left to speculate whether \"101 East Eager Street\" is the correct or wrong address[,] given the lack of context in [the detectives'] notes.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-180\">\n   Yet, McClain is the only person who is ever mentioned throughout the entire record extract whose first name or last name is \"Asia.\" Given that circumstance, it is extremely unlikely that Gordon was referring to someone other than McClain when he mentioned \"Asia.\" Additionally, the record\n   extract is devoid of any letters to Syed other than McClain's letters to him, which undermines the circuit court's theory that Gordon might have been referring to \"another letter altogether.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   Significantly, the circuit court's reasoning is not entitled to deference. In reviewing a trial court's determination as to whether a defendant received ineffective assistance of counsel, an appellate court reviews for clear error the trial court's findings of fact, and reviews without deference the trial court's conclusions of law. As Judge Adkins wrote for this Court in\n   <em>\n    Newton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12314795,12490756\" index=\"393\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/455/341/\">\n    455 Md. at 351-52\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12314795,12490756\" index=\"394\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/455/341/\">\n    168 A.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   7 :\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-182\">\n   The review of a postconviction court's findings regarding ineffective assistance of counsel is a mixed question of law and fact. Because we are not finders of fact, we defer to the factual findings of the postconviction court unless clearly erroneous. But we review the court's legal conclusion regarding whether the defendant's Sixth Amendment rights were violated without deference. We re-weigh the facts in light of the law to determine whether a constitutional violation has occurred.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   (Cleaned up). Accordingly, here, this Court reviews without deference the circuit court's conclusions of law, such as its conclusion that Syed's trial counsel's performance was deficient. In other words, this Court gives no weight to the circuit court's determination that Syed had proven deficient performance, and the reasoning underlying that determination. This standard of review is especially appropriate in light of the circumstance that the circuit court judge who presided over both postconviction hearings was not the circuit court judge who presided over the second trial; in other words, the circuit court judge whose decision we are reviewing was not in a better position than this Court is to determine whether Syed's trial counsel's performance was deficient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   I am unpersuaded by Syed's reliance on\n   <em>\n    Grooms\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10541967\" index=\"395\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/923/88/#p89\">\n    923 F.2d at 90-91\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Lawrence\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10527981\" index=\"396\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/900/127/#p129\">\n    900 F.2d at 129-30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Montgomery v.

In none of those cases was there any indication that a potential alibi witness's testimony could have prejudiced the defendant. By contrast, here, McClain's testimony could have prejudiced Syed by contradicting his pretrial statements to Officer Adcock and Detective O'Shea, contradicting his trial counsel's reasonable choice of defense strategy, and otherwise appearing to be a fabrication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   Syed's trial counsel was not required to call McClain as a witness just because there was a chance, however slight, that\n   the jury would have viewed her testimony as exculpatory. No reasonable criminal defense lawyer would advocate that, in every case, the defense should, to use a colloquialism, \"throw everything at the wall to see what sticks.\" Instead, a reasonable criminal defense lawyer should evaluate each piece of allegedly exculpatory evidence to determine whether it would, in fact, help the defendant. Where, as here, the evidence could prejudice the defendant, it is reasonable for the defendant's trial counsel to exercise caution by refraining from pursuing the evidence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   It might be tempting to reason that, given that the jury found Syed guilty, his trial counsel might as well have contacted McClain and called her as a witness, as doing so could not have resulted in a worse outcome for Syed. Such reasoning, however,\n   would fly in the face of the Supreme Court's jurisprudence regarding ineffective assistance of counsel.

Mr. Syed's trial counsel also received two letters from Ms. McClain, offering herself as a witness who would testify that she saw Mr. Syed at the public library.

While the\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   standard for proving prejudice is undeniably high, and decidedly deferential to trial counsel's performance, it clearly requires the showing of merely \"a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"422\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    466 U.S. at 694\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"423\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    104 S.Ct. at 2068\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-198\">\n   The State offered a significant amount of evidence regarding Mr. Syed's whereabouts and actions on the evening of January 13, 1999, beginning after the time in which the State argued Ms. Lee had been killed. The State posited that Ms. Lee was killed between 2:15PM and 2:35PM that afternoon, a contention that Mr. Syed did not, and does not, refute. The State's evidence included testimony that Mr. Syed's handprint was found on Ms. Lee's car, evidence putting him in the vicinity of Ms. Lee's body, evidence of Mr. Syed's involvement in disposing Ms. Lee's body, and motive and opportunity to kill Ms. Lee. Of particular importance, the State offered no direct evidence regarding Mr. Syed's whereabouts during the time of Ms. Lee's\n   death. This evidence submitted by the State, albeit extensive, was circumstantial. The post-conviction court even observed that the crux of the State's argument was that Mr. Syed buried Ms. Lee in the park at approximately 7:00PM on January 13, 1999, roughly four and a half hours after the State's proposed time of death.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-199\">\n   In his defense, Mr. Syed offered testimony from a number of witnesses to establish a timeline of Mr. Syed's daily schedule\n   and habit. This included Mr. Syed's practice of attending track practice from approximately 4:00PM to 5:30PM or 6:00PM, followed by attending services at his mosque in the evening. The evidence offered by Mr. Syed similarly does not address his whereabouts during the crucial time of Ms. Lee's death that day. The lack of evidence offered establishing Mr. Syed's location between 2:15PM and 2:35PM is precisely why Ms. McClain's alibi is so significant to the present case. Ms. McClain offered to testify, and offered multiple corresponding affidavits, that she and her boyfriend at the time saw and spoke with Mr. Syed at the Woodlawn Public Library at the time the State contends that Mr. Syed killed Ms. Lee. Not only does Ms. McClain's alibi address the most integral period of time in the case, it presents direct, not merely circumstantial, evidence of Mr. Syed's whereabouts during that time. In so far as I could determine, no other evidence was offered by the State that would have refuted Ms. McClain's testimony and affidavits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-200\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Griffin v. Warden, Maryland Correctional Adjustment Center\n   </em>\n   , the Fourth Circuit determined that an attorney's failure to investigate an alibi witness was both deficient and prejudicial to the defendant's case.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10519302\" index=\"424\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/970/1355/#p1356\">\n    970 F.2d 1355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1358 (4th Cir. 1992). The Fourth Circuit reasoned that \"[e]yewitness identification evidence, uncorroborated by a fingerprint, gun, confession, or coconspirator testimony, is a thin thread to shackle a man for forty years.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10519302\" index=\"425\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/970/1355/#p1356\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10519302\" index=\"425\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/970/1355/#p1356\">\n    at 1359\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In the present case, the State offered no eyewitness testimony, or any other evidence for that matter, putting Mr. Syed with Ms. Lee during the time of her death, much less any direct evidence that Mr. Syed caused the death of Ms. Lee. Ms. McClain's alibi was direct, uncontroverted evidence that Mr. Syed was elsewhere at the time of Ms. Lee's death. Mr. Syed does not have to definitively rebut his criminal agency, he merely has to establish that there is a reasonable probability that the result would have been different.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10519302\" index=\"426\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/970/1355/#p1356\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10519302\" index=\"426\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/970/1355/#p1356\">\n    at 1359\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (commenting that the state court incorrectly posited that the alibi evidence \"did not affirmatively demonstrate that [Griffin] was at home when the crime was committed[ ]\").

In fact, the State made the same argument, attempting to establish before the post-conviction court a new timeline in which Ms. Lee died after 2:45PM rather than between 2:15PM and 2:35PM. However, \"[t]he post-conviction court concluded that '[b]ased on the facts and arguments reflected in the record, the [c]ourt finds that\n   <em>\n    the State committed to the 2:36 p.m. timeline and thus, the [c]ourt will not accept the newly established timeline\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Syed v.

This original timeline was undisputed by Mr. Syed during trial, and throughout his post-conviction proceedings. The post-conviction court was correct in declining to adopt this new timeline. The majority's\n   argument that Mr. Syed could have killed Ms. Lee at another time blatantly conflicts with the post-conviction court's holding. I would not disturb the post-conviction court's ruling on this issue. The possibility that Ms. Lee was killed at a different time was not offered before the judge and jury during trial. Accordingly, I would not adopt the unsubstantiated opinion that the jury could create and believe a timeline other than the original one posited to them at trial.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"429\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    466 U.S. at 695\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"430\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n    104 S.Ct. at 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (stating that a court must analyze \"the totality of the evidence\n   <em>\n    before the judge or jury\n   </em>\n   [ ]\") (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-202\">\n   The majority, echoing the argument advanced by the State during the post-conviction proceeding, declared that Ms. McClain's alibi is just a single piece of evidence that does not satisfactorily challenge the substantial amount of evidence presented by the State.

For example, in her letter to Mr. Syed dated March 1, 1999, Ms. McClain indicates that she could help account for his \"unaccountable lost time (2:15 [p.m.] - 8:00 [p.m.]; Jan. 13th).\" In the affidavit dated March 25, 2000, Ms. McClain avers that she had been in the library waiting for a ride at 2:20 p.m. when she saw Mr. Syed and \"held a 15-20 minute conversation\" with him and that she left around 2:40 p.m. In Ms. McClain's affidavit dated January 13, 2015, she alleges that she saw Mr. Syed enter the library \"at around 2:30 p.m.\" and had a conversation with him at that time and that she \"left the library around 2:40 [p.m.]\". Had the jury heard Ms. McClain's alibi, her testimony could have been more problematic than helpful to Mr. Syed's case. For example, Ms. McClain's belief about Mr. Syed's whereabouts on the afternoon of January 13, 1999 did not comport with the theory that Mr. Syed's routine was to attend track practice after school because his routine did not involve going to the Woodlawn Public Library. Also, Ms. McClain's letter dated March 1, 1999 indicated that she would \"try [her] best to help [Mr. Syed] account for some of [his] unwitnessed, unaccountable lost time (2:15 - 8:00; Jan. 13th).\" The jury could have concluded that Ms. McClain's statement was an offer to fabricate an alibi for Mr. Syed, thereby undermining Ms. McClain's credibility as a disinterested witness. Given this potential, we cannot say there is a substantial probability that the jury would have discounted Mr. Wilds's testimony in favor of Ms. McClain's testimony. Furthermore, Ms. McClain's testimony could have been more harmful than helpful because it would have created another inconsistency in Mr. Syed's case.

Syed is mistaken to the extent that he argues that this Court must exclusively analyze his trial counsel's refraining from contacting McClain, and that this Court cannot analyze his trial counsel's refraining from calling McClain as a witness. To establish ineffective assistance of counsel, Syed must prove both deficient performance and prejudice. Syed would be unable to establish prejudice if his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel was based exclusively on his trial counsel's refraining from contacting McClain. After all, it would have made no difference to the second trial if Syed's trial counsel had contacted McClain, but then refrained from calling her as a witness. Indeed, in his brief, Syed argues that his \"trial counsel's failure to contact [McClain] and present her testimony to the jury\" prejudiced him. Thus, it is necessary for this Court to analyze Syed's trial counsel's refraining from calling McClain as a witness.\n   </p>\n   <blockquote id=\"p-241\">\n    As discussed below, I would conclude that, in light of information of which Syed's trial counsel was aware, McClain's testimony could have prejudiced Syed. That conclusion supports both Syed's trial counsel's decision to refrain from contacting McClain and her decision to refrain from calling McClain as a witness.\n   </blockquote>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-242\">\n    I am unpersuaded by the State's contention that, where the record is silent as to the reasons for a defendant's trial counsel's decision, the defendant cannot rebut the presumption that his or her trial counsel's decision was reasonable.\n    <em>\n     Strickland\n    </em>\n    and its progeny make clear that what matters is \"the objective reasonableness of counsel's performance,\n    <strong>\n     not counsel's subjective state of mind.\n    </strong>\n    \"\n    <em>\n     Richter\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12439786,6005083\" index=\"488\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/86/\">\n     562 U.S. at 110\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12439786,6005083\" index=\"489\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/562/86/\">\n     131 S.Ct. 770\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (citing\n    <em>\n     Strickland\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"490\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n     466 U.S. at 688\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"491\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/\">\n     104 S.Ct. 2052\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ) (emphasis added). Thus, here, even if the record were silent as to the reasons for Syed's trial counsel's decision not to call McClain as a witness, the record's silence would make no difference to the proper analysis, which turns on whether a reasonable lawyer in Syed's trial counsel's position could have refrained from calling McClain as a witness.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-243\">\n    Although the circuit court inadvertently stated that the State's evidence indicated that Lee was murdered between 2:35 p.m. and 2:40 p.m. on January 13, 1999, in actuality, the State's evidence indicated that, on that date, Lee was murdered sometime in the twenty-one minutes between 2:15 p.m., when the school day ended, and 2:36 p.m., when, according to Syed's cell phone records and Wilds's testimony, Syed used a pay phone to telephone Wilds (who had Syed's cell phone) and asked him to come to the parking lot of the Best Buy in Woodlawn.
