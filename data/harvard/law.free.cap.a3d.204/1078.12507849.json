That decree denied and dismissed Mr. Powers's appeal, in accordance with a written decision of the Appellate Division dated December 16, 2015. This Court granted Mr. Powers's petition for a writ of certiorari on September 13, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Before this Court, Mr. Powers contends: (1) that he \"should not be estopped from arguing that he was a full-time employee working part-time hours simply because a stipulation was entered in the Workers' Compensation Court stating that he was a part-time employee;\" and (2) that \"the average weekly wage, as calculated pursuant to [G.L. 1956] \u00a7 28-33-20 for the purpose of determining workers' compensation benefits, must include monies received by an employee from the state for hours not worked, pursuant to an approved work-sharing program under [G.L. 1956] \u00a7 28-44-69.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   This case first came before the Court on September 27, 2017, pursuant to an order directing the parties to appear and show cause why the issues raised in this matter should not be summarily decided. After hearing the arguments of counsel and examining the memoranda filed by the parties, we concluded that cause had been shown, and we assigned this case to the regular calendar for further briefing and argument. We heard oral arguments on September 27, 2018.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we affirm the decree of the Appellate Division of the Workers' Compensation Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <strong>\n    I\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   <strong>\n    Facts and Travel\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The facts of this matter are not in dispute. On December 31, 2012, Mr. Powers injured his left knee while shoveling snow during the course of his employment with the Warwick Public Schools. Due to his injury, he was unable to work from January 1, 2013 until April 3, 2013. At the time of the injury, in addition to receiving remuneration\n   from the Warwick Public Schools, Mr. Powers was also receiving work-sharing benefits from the state under an approved work-sharing program pursuant to \u00a7 28-44-69.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   As a result of his inability to work due to injury, he applied for workers' compensation benefits. His \"average weekly wage\" for workers' compensation benefits pursuant to \u00a7 28-33-20 was calculated thereafter, but that calculation did not take into account the work-sharing benefits which Mr. Powers had been receiving. On March 8, 2013, Mr. Powers filed a \"claim for a trial,\" pursuant to G.L. 1956 \u00a7 28-35-20(d),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   in order to challenge the calculation of his average weekly wage before the WCC.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The parties then filed trial memoranda and agreed to a stipulation of facts before the WCC, which stated as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-17\">\n   \"1. As of 12/31/12 the Petitioner was a part-time employee of the Respondent.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-18\">\n   \"2. The Employee [ (Mark Powers) ] was injured at work on 12/31/12.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   \"3. During the 26 weeks prior to the week of the injury, the employee earned wages from the employer for work performed. Also during the 26 weeks prior to the week of the injury, the Employee received unemployment compensation benefits from the State of Rhode Island, pursuant to a Work Sharing Plan in accordance with RIGL 28-44-69.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   \"4. The issue in this case is whether or not said unemployment compensation benefits received in the 26 weeks prior to the week of the injury should be added to said part-time wages earned in the 26 weeks prior to the week of the injury in order to calculate the average weekly wage for that injury.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   \"5. The amount of wages earned by the employee during the weeks 10/20/12 through 12/29/12 equals $\n   <em>\n    2, 880.62.\n   </em>\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   \"6. The amount of unemployment compensation benefits received in the 26 weeks prior to the week of the injury equals $\n   <em>\n    8,405\n   </em>\n   which equals a supplemental wage of $\n   <em>\n    323.27\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis in original.)\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Nothing more of pertinence was submitted, and the parties rested on the day of trial. On September 25, 2013, the trial judge of the WCC issued a bench decision, in which he found that work-sharing benefits were \"tantamount to unemployment compensation benefits\" and were properly not included in Mr. Powers's average weekly wage. Upon Mr. Powers's appeal, the Appellate Division of the WCC issued a written decision on December 16, 2015, affirming the trial judge's bench decision; a final decree then entered. Mr. Powers subsequently petitioned this Court for a writ of certiorari, which this Court granted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   <strong>\n    II\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   <strong>\n    Standard of Review\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   We begin by noting that \"[o]ur review of a case on certiorari is limited to\n   an examination of the record to determine if an error of law has been committed.\"\n   <em>\n    DeCurtis v.

Mr. Powers also implies in his brief that his stipulation to being a part-time employee was a \"clear mistake of fact or an erroneous legal conclusion.\" However, our case law has required \"fraud, mutual mistake or actual absence of consent\" to modify such a stipulation.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9435753\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/798/877/#p881\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (internal quotation marks omitted).

Indeed, the determination as to whether or not work-sharing benefits are akin to unemployment compensation benefits and should or should not be taken into account when determining a worker's average weekly wage is a question of statutory construction, and questions of statutory construction are questions of law.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    City of East Providence v.

Consequently, our analysis and conclusions are not influenced by Mr. Powers having stipulated to receiving unemployment compensation benefits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   <strong>\n    B\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   <strong>\n    Work-Sharing Benefits\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   We turn next to Mr. Powers's argument before this Court that the calculation of the average weekly wage which he was to be awarded by the WCC, pursuant to \u00a7 28-33-20, should have taken into account monies he received from the state pursuant to an approved work-sharing program\n   under \u00a7 28-44-69. This is an issue of first impression in Rhode Island.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   <strong>\n    1. Relevant Statutory Sections\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Section 28-44-69 lays out the work-sharing program in Rhode Island. The program allows an employer to avoid layoffs by reducing the hours to be worked by a specific group of employees pursuant to a work-sharing plan. Such a work-sharing plan must be approved by the Director of the Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 28-44-69(b)(1). The state then pays the employees some portion of the difference between their actual income from the work-sharing employer and what they would have received had they been working on a full-time basis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The employer is required to continue paying health and retirement benefits as if the employee has remained a full-time employee.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 28-44-69(b)(1)(v). Additionally, the program requires the affected employee to remain available to work a normal, full-time work week for the work-sharing employer.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   \u00a7 28-44-69(g)(2). Of additional relevance to this case is the fact that the statute provides that claims for work-sharing benefits shall be filed in the same manner as claims for unemployment compensation benefits and that \"[p]rovisions applicable to unemployment compensation shall apply to work-sharing claimants to the extent that they are not inconsistent with the established work-sharing provisions.\" Section 28-44-69(h)(6) and (7).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Also of import in our assessment of this action is \u00a7 28-33-20. Section 28-33-20 falls within the chapter of the General Laws that deals with workers' compensation benefits and provides in pertinent part as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-49\">\n   \"(a) For the purposes of this chapter, the average weekly wage shall be ascertained as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-50\">\n   \"(1) For full-time or regular employees, by dividing the gross wages, inclusive of overtime pay; provided, that bonuses and overtime shall be averaged over the length of employment but not in excess of the preceding fifty-two (52) week period, earned by the injured worker in employment by the employer in whose service he or she is injured during the thirteen (13) calendar weeks immediately preceding the week in which he or she was injured, by the number of calendar weeks during which, or any portions of which, the worker was actually employed by that employer, including any paid vacation time. * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-51\">\n   \"* * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-52\">\n   \"(3) 'Wages of an employee working part-time' means the gross wages earned during the number of weeks so employed, or of weeks in which the employee worked, up to a maximum of twenty-six (26) calendar weeks immediately preceding the date of injury, divided by the number of weeks employed, or by twenty-six (26), as the case may be. * * * Wages shall be calculated as follows:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-53\">\n   \"(i) For part-time employees, by dividing the gross wages, inclusive of overtime pay; provided, any bonuses and overtime shall be averaged over the length of employment but not in excess of the preceding fifty-two (52) week period, earned by the injured worker in employment by the employer in whose service he or she is injured during the twenty-six (26) consecutive calendar weeks immediately preceding the week in which he or she\n   was injured, by the number of calendar weeks during which, or any portion of which, the worker was actually employed by that employer, including any paid vacation time. * * *\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   <strong>\n    2. The Decision of the Appellate Division of the WCC\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   The Appellate Division reconciled the two just-discussed statutes by finding that work-sharing benefits are not to be considered in calculating a particular employee's average weekly wage. The Appellate Division noted that work-sharing benefits are paid for time\n   <em>\n    not worked\n   </em>\n   , and it could not equate them with a wage-the ordinary meaning of which the Appellate Division understood to be \"the value received for the duties and labors which a workman performs, i.e., the value received for services actually rendered.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   The Appellate Division further pointed out that vacation pay, overtime, and bonuses are all expressly included in the average weekly wage calculation and that the Supreme Court has held that holiday pay is also to be included in the average weekly wage calculation. The Appellate Division then stated that holiday and vacation pay are distinguishable from work-sharing benefits in that they are \"incidents of employment.\" The Appellate Division elaborated as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-57\">\n   \"Holiday pay and vacation pay * * * are benefit[s] typically provided under an employment agreement, and [are] benefit[s] that an employee acquires over time as a result of continued employment with the same employer. * * * In this sense, they are 'earned' monies, despite the fact that the employee is not actually working on the date for which he receives the payment. * * * He earns wages from the employer for the hours he works and receives work-sharing benefits based upon the hours he is\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   working. * * * Vacation pay and holiday pay are further distinguished from work-sharing benefits because they are paid directly from the employer to the employee, as distinguished from work-sharing benefits which are paid by the State to the employee.\" (Emphasis in original) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In conclusion, the Appellate Division held that work-sharing benefits are a type of unemployment compensation and not a form of wages to be included in the calculation of an employee's average weekly wage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   <strong>\n    3. Discussion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   We begin by noting that, with laudable candor, it was conceded by Mr. Powers's counsel at oral argument before this Court that traditional unemployment compensation benefits would not be used in calculating the average weekly wage.

We recognize that there are certain differences between traditional unemployment compensation benefits and work-sharing benefits, and we do not mean to suggest that they are one and the same. However, we deem it within the bounds of our inquiry to look to the indications in the statutory schemes before us which lead us to the conclusion that, in this context, work-sharing benefits should be treated like traditional unemployment compensation benefits.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

That statute also states that no individual shall be eligible for unemployment compensation benefits and work-sharing benefits in a total amount that is more than the maximum entitlement of the individual to unemployment compensation benefits in any benefit year; it goes on to state that any work-sharing benefits paid will be deducted from the maximum entitlement amount. Section 28-44-69(h)(2) and (3). Accordingly, it is apparent from the broader statutory schemes at issue that work-sharing benefits, at least in the context of the instant case, are to be treated like traditional unemployment compensation and should not be included in determining average weekly wage. It is clear to this Court that such benefits are not included as part of the term \"wages\" in \u00a7 28-33-20.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Mr. Powers contends that work-sharing benefits should be equated, not with traditional unemployment compensation benefits, but with holiday pay and vacation pay. This Court has ruled that holiday pay is to be included in the determination of average weekly wage.\n   <em>\n    Smith v. Colonial Knife Co., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11668697\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/731/724/#p725\">\n    731 A.2d 724\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 725 (R.I. 1999). Likewise, vacation pay is expressly included in the average weekly wage calculation pursuant to \u00a7 28-33-20(a)(1) and (a)(3)(i).\n   <em>\n    See also\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cole\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11331885\" index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/679/875/#p877\">\n    679 A.2d at 878\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . However, we are unpersuaded by the comparison thereto that Mr. Powers seeks to draw. It is true that an employee does not actually work when receiving vacation or holiday pay. However, we are of the opinion that the term \"wages\" understandably includes vacation and holiday pay, as those are incidents of employment. Section 28-44-69(a)(4) (providing that \"paid vacation and holidays * * * are incidents of employment\");\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Cole\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11331885\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/679/875/#p877\">\n    679 A.2d at 878\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"Vacation pay is an incident of employment. * * * [I]t is a benefit that an employee acquires over time as a result of continued employment with the same employer.\"). Those benefits are earned as a function of the fact of previous and continuing service to an employer, and they are paid to the employee by the employer. Work-sharing benefits are not incidents of employment; they are not acquired over time due to service to that employer. Rather, as we have stated previously, work-sharing benefits are monies being paid by the state for the employee not to work. As such, we are unpersuaded by Mr. Powers's attempt to liken work-sharing benefits to vacation and holiday pay.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   We are not insensitive to the policy considerations which might militate in favor of broader statutory coverage so as to allow work-sharing benefits to be taken into account in determining average weekly wage, but it is our role to apply the law as it is written. \"[I]t is not the function of this Court to act as a super legislative body and rewrite or amend statutes already enacted by the General Assembly.\"\n   <em>\n    Willis v.
