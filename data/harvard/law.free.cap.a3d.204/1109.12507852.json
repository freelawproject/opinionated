In this insurance dispute, appellant, Rainforest Chocolate, LLC (Rainforest), appeals the summary judgment motion granted in favor of appellee, Sentinel Insurance Company, Ltd. (Sentinel). Rainforest argues that the trial court erred in its interpretation of the insurance policy and its conclusion that Rainforest's loss was not covered. We reverse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   \u00b6 2. The facts are undisputed. Rainforest was insured under a business-owner policy offered by Sentinel. In May 2016, Rainforest's employee received an email purporting to be from his manager. The email directed the employee to transfer $19,875 to a specified outside bank account through an electronic-funds transfer. Unbeknownst to the employee, an unknown individual had gained control of the manager's email account and sent the email. The employee electronically transferred the money. Shortly thereafter when Rainforest learned that the manager had not sent the email, it contacted its bank, which froze its account and limited the loss to $10,261.36.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   \u00b6 3. Rainforest reported the loss to Sentinel. In a series of letters exchanged concerning coverage for the loss, Rainforest claimed the loss should be covered under provisions of the policy covering losses due to Forgery, for Forged or Altered Instruments, and for losses resulting from Computer Fraud. Sentinel denied coverage. In a continuing attempt to obtain coverage for the loss, Rainforest also claimed coverage under a provision of the policy for the loss of Money or Securities by theft. Sentinel again denied coverage, primarily relying on an exclusion for physical loss or physical damage caused by or resulting from False Pretense that concerned \"voluntary parting\" of the property-the False Pretense Exclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \u00b6 4. After cross-motions for summary judgment, based on a statement of agreed facts, the trial court denied Rainforest's motion, granted Sentinel's motion, and entered judgment in favor of Sentinel. In its conclusion, the court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-13\">\n   The complicated nature of this policy, with its layers of coverages and exclusions, is almost impossible to follow without a compass and a guide. It took the court many hours of reading and rereading the policy and the briefs to reach a clear understanding of how the various provisions fit together. How any insured, however sophisticated, is supposed to determine that it is getting what it paid for with a policy like this is a mystery to the court. Nonetheless, the court concludes that the terms of the policy, while confusing, are not ambiguous and must be enforced as written.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The court held that Sentinel was correct in denying coverage under the False Pretense Exclusion. Rainforest timely appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \u00b6 5. \"This Court reviews summary judgment rulings de novo, applying the same standard as the trial court.\"\n   <em>\n    Jadallah v.

With these interpretation principles in mind, we turn to the insurance policy at hand. As the trial court noted, there are several subsections of the policy at the center of our analysis. First, the Special Property Coverage Form (SPC Form) outlines the general \"rights, duties, and what is and is not covered\" and the additional coverage areas in Section A, and then defines several terms in Section G.\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   A.

The crux of this case is whether the False Pretense Exclusion bars coverage for the loss experienced by Rainforest. Rainforest argues that the False Pretense Exclusion does not apply because it only excludes \"physical loss or physical damages\" and the loss here was not a physical loss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   \u00b6 12. Recently, the U.S. District Court for the District of Montana interpreted this exact provision in the context of a procedural history, fact pattern, and insurance policy that is virtually the same as the instant case. See\n   <em>\n    Ad Advert. Design, Inc. v. Sentinel Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12528235\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp-3d/344/1175/\">\n    344 F.Supp.3d 1175\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204621744\">\n    2018 WL 4621744\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. Mont. 2018). We find its reasoning and interpretation of the policy sound and convincing, and thus adopt it here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   \u00b6 13. In\n   <em>\n    Ad Design\n   </em>\n   , an employee received several emails from a supervisor's email account requesting that specific sums be transferred to an outside bank account. Believing the emails were legitimate, the employee wired money from the business's (Ad Design's) account into the specified accounts only to find out, after the transfers were complete, that the emails were fraudulent. Ad Design filed a claim with its insurer, Sentinel, seeking coverage for the loss, but Sentinel denied the claim, explaining that the policy excluded coverage under the False Pretense Exclusion. The only apparent differences between the\n   <em>\n    Ad Design\n   </em>\n   facts and the facts at issue here are: (1) Ad Design made four distinct transfers for a total of $115,595, where Rainforest only made one transfer of $19,875; and (2) Ad Design was not able to limit its loss by freezing its account and thus lost the entirety of the transferred amount, where Rainforest's bank was able to successfully freeze the transfer and limit its loss to $10,261.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   \u00b6 14. The relevant provisions of the insurance policies in\n   <em>\n    Ad Design\n   </em>\n   and here are identical. The District Court of Montana outlined the same provisions that are at issue here: the SPC Form generally explaining the policy's coverage; additional coverage forms extending coverage for Forgery, Money and Securities, and Computer Fraud; and the False Pretense Exclusion. The court focused on the False Pretense Exclusion, identifying it as the critical issue in the case.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 1180-81,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204621744\">\n    2018 WL 4621744\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at *4. The arguments presented by Ad Design and Sentinel also mirror the arguments advanced by Rainforest and Sentinel here. Ad Design did not dispute that it voluntarily parted with its money as contemplated by the False\n   Pretense Exclusion. It instead asserted that \"because electronic funds are intangible, it could not have suffered a 'physical loss.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204621744\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Sentinel countered and asserted that the business \"lost actual, physical control and possession of its money that it otherwise could have withdrawn from its bank account,\" and therefore Ad Design was precluded from coverage under the False Pretense Exclusion.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%204621744\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \u00b6 15.

Because there were two reasonable interpretations of the policy, the District Court of Montana found the False Pretense Exclusion ambiguous and thus construed it against Sentinel.

Here, the trial court conceded that other courts have held transfers of funds are not \"physical\" because they are the losses of funds on deposit in a bank, rather than losses of cash, such as paper money or coins. But the trial court explained that it was not persuaded by this rationale because funds held by a bank fell within the policy's definition of \"money,\" which is defined as \"[c]urrency, coins and bank notes\n   <em>\n    whether or not in current use\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis added.)

But just because funds, whether or not in current use, fall under the policy's definition of \"money\" does not then lend itself to the automatic conclusion that \"money\" can only be subject to \"physical loss.\" We find support for this conclusion by comparing the Forgery, Money and Securities, and Computer Fraud provisions. The Forgery provision states that Sentinel \"will pay for\n   <em>\n    loss\n   </em>\n   resulting directly from forgery ... in 'money' \" and the Money and Securities provision states that Sentinel \"will pay for\n   <em>\n    loss\n   </em>\n   of 'money,' \" while the Computer Fraud provision states that Sentinel will pay \"for\n   <em>\n    physical loss or physical damage\n   </em>\n   to 'money.' \" (Emphases added.) This differing use of \"physical loss\" and simply \"loss\" leads this Court to conclude that it cannot be said that all \"money\" is subject solely to physical loss simply because funds, whether or not in current use, qualify as \"money\" under the policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-71\">\n   \u00b6 22. If Rainforest or another insured business sought to clarify the extent of its coverage, it would likely turn toward the policy language itself and perhaps existing case law interpreting similar policies. However, this search would not have produced a clear, unambiguous answer for a reasonably prudent person. See\n   <em>\n    State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v.

The policy uses the two distinct phrases-\"physical loss and physical damage\" and \"loss and damage\"-within different sections throughout the policy, sometimes switching between the two sentence\n   to sentence, which would lead the average reader to assume there was some difference between them.\n   <footnotemark>\n    *\n   </footnotemark>\n   But, the policy itself does not define or explain the difference between the two phrases. The trial court dismissed this as \"sloppy drafting\" but sloppiness should not excuse an insurer from covering losses that a reasonable insured party would expect to be covered, based on a reasonable reading and interpretation of the policy language.

And further, if Rainforest or another insured business looked to caselaw, they would have been met with a similarly opaque answer because for every court that has analyzed a similar issue, there is a different conclusion. As shown by the District of Montana in\n   <em>\n    Ad Design\n   </em>\n   , there is case law that supports both Sentinel's and Rainforest's interpretations.

Although this Court has not previously adopted one interpretation over another, we are convinced that the False Pretense Exclusion is subject to at least two reasonable interpretations, and thus is ambiguous. Therefore, we are bound to interpret it in Rainforest's favor-the loss suffered was not physical, and thus coverage is not barred by the False Pretense Exclusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \u00b6 25. The question remains whether the loss is covered by any of the provisions, which Rainforest claims provide coverage: Forgery, Money and Securities, and Computer Fraud. We can quickly dismiss the Computer Fraud provision because it only provides coverage \"for\n   <em>\n    physical loss of or physical damage\n   </em>\n   to 'money' ... resulting directly from computer fraud,\" and because we concluded that Rainforest's loss was not physical, it is not covered under this provision.
