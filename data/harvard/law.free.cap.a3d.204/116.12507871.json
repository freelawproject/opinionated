Bar R. XI, \u00a7 14 (g) affidavit on February 4, 2019, it is\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-9\">\n   ORDERED that respondent's motion for leave to file his late response is granted and the lodged response and attachments are filed. It is\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   FURTHER ORDERED that Anthony Jacob Zappin is hereby disbarred from the practice of law in the District of Columbia,\n   <em>\n    nunc pro tunc\n   </em>\n   to February 4, 2019. To the extent respondent attempts to challenge the imposition of reciprocal discipline by requesting this court provide him a hearing to relitigate the underlying findings and discipline imposed by the State of New York, such a challenge is improper in\n   reciprocal disciplinary proceedings,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Zdravkovich\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9090555\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/831/964/#p969\">\n    831 A.2d 964\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 969 (D.C. 2003) (\"Put simply, reciprocal discipline proceedings are not a forum to reargue the foreign discipline.\"). Further, to the extent respondent urges that this proceeding be dismissed because the state of New York either improperly imposed the doctrine of collateral estoppel as to respondent's actions that gave rise to the disciplinary action or that the standard of proof was different wherein some of the bases for discipline were findings made by the court in his domestic case, neither provides respondent with relief.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Benjamin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12006394\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/698/434/#p440\">\n    698 A.2d 434\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 440 (D.C. 1997) (holding that differences in standard of proof does not automatically establish an infirmity of proof);\n   <em>\n    In re Wilde\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7308986\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/68/749/#p761\">\n    68 A.3d 749\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 761 (D.C. 2013) (upholding the use of collateral estoppel in disciplinary cases). Because respondent failed to rebut the presumption that reciprocal discipline should be imposed, we impose reciprocal discipline.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Sibley\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7289674\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/990/483/\">\n    990 A.2d 483\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D.C. 2010), and\n   <em>\n    In re Fuller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8347738\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/930/194/#p198\">\n    930 A.2d 194\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 198 (D.C. 2007) (rebuttable presumption of identical reciprocal discipline applies unless one of the exceptions is established).\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
