Walker, appeals\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   from the judgment of the trial court dismissing in part and denying in part his motion to correct an illegal sentence. On\n   appeal, the defendant claims that the court improperly (1) dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction his claim that the sentencing court failed to canvass him or his counsel regarding their review and the accuracy of the presentence investigation report, and (2) denied on the merits, without first providing him with an adequate hearing before the sentencing court, his claim that the sentencing court relied on inaccurate facts contained in the presentence investigation report. We conclude that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider both of the defendant's claims raised by the motion to correct an illegal sentence. Accordingly, we affirm in part and reverse in part the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of the defendant's claims. On February 14, 1991, the defendant entered a guilty plea pursuant to\n   <em>\n    North Carolina\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Alford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12045986\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/400/25/#p37\">\n    400 U.S. 25\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 37,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12045986\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/400/25/#p37\">\n    91 S.Ct. 160\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12045986\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/400/25/#p37\">\n    27 L.Ed.2d 162\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1970),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   to one count of\n   robbery in the first degree in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1989) \u00a7 53a-134 (a) (4) and one count of sexual assault in the third degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-72a (1991 convictions). The Office of Adult Probation then prepared a presentence investigation report. On March 22, 1991, pursuant to the parties' plea agreement, the court sentenced the defendant to a total effective term of fourteen years incarceration, execution suspended after nine years, with three years probation. On January 12, 1996, the defendant was discharged from the custody of the Department of Correction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Between late 1999 and early 2000, the defendant engaged in further criminal misconduct. On January 23, 2001, the defendant was convicted in absentia,\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   following a jury trial, of two counts of aggravated sexual assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70a (a) (1), four counts of sexual assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (1), two counts of kidnapping in the first degree with a firearm in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-92a, four counts of kidnapping in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-92 (a) (2) (A), threatening in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 53a-62 (a) (2), criminal possession of a weapon in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 53a-217, two counts of credit card theft in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-128c (a), three counts of fraudulent use of an automatic teller machine in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-127b, two counts of illegal use of a credit card in violation of General Statutes \u00a7 53a-128d, and one count of larceny in the sixth degree in violation of General Statutes (Rev. to 1999) \u00a7 53a-125b (2001 convictions).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Thereafter, the Office of Adult Probation prepared a presentence investigation report (2001 PSI report) in advance of the defendant's sentencing for the 2001 convictions. The 2001 PSI report contained detailed information concerning the defendant's\n   past criminal history, including the facts underlying his 1991 convictions. Also attached to the 2001 PSI report was a \"Synopsis of Facts\" provided by the Office of the State's Attorney that detailed the facts underlying the 2001 convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On April 27, 2001, the sentencing court conducted the defendant's sentencing hearing at which it heard statements from the state, the victim, the victim's mother, defense counsel, and the defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the conclusion of the hearing, the court sentenced the defendant to a total effective term of fifty years incarceration, execution suspended after thirty-two years, followed by twenty years probation. The defendant's 2001 convictions were affirmed on direct appeal by this court.

[were] inaccurate and prejudicial\" because the 1991 convictions were unconstitutional in three ways: (1) \"they were based on contradictory assertions of the complaining witness as to whether a sexual assault had ever taken place,\" (2) \"counsel in the 1991 case failed to investigate possible connections between organized crime figures and the complaining witness that may have tainted the complainant's credibility,\" and (3) \"counsel was ineffective for advising [the defendant] that he should plead guilty because his case would be a 'tough case to win.' \" The defendant claimed that, as a result, his sentence \"was imposed in an illegal manner\" because the sentencing court: (1) \"fail[ed] to specifically canvass the [defendant] or his counsel as to their review and the accuracy of the [2001 PSI] report ... in violation of [Practice Book \u00a7] 43-10\" and (2) \"specifically rel[ied]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   upon unconstitutional and inaccurate information contained in the [2001 PSI report] ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On October 23, 2015, the state filed a motion to dismiss the defendant's motion to correct an illegal sentence on the ground that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to entertain it. In its memorandum of law in support of the motion, the state argued that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the defendant's claim that the sentencing court failed to canvass him or his attorney because such a claim had been foreclosed by our Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4304713\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/295/825/#p840\">\n    295 Conn. 825\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 840-41,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=992%20A.2d%201103\">\n    992 A.2d 1103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2010) (claims that defendant \"had been deprived of an opportunity to review his presentence report and to address inaccuracies therein; and ... [defense counsel] had failed to review the presentence report with him or to bring any inaccuracies in the report to the court's attention\" did not provide jurisdictional basis for correcting sentence imposed in illegal manner). The state also argued that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the defendant's claim that the sentencing court relied on inaccurate information in the 2001 PSI report because \"[s]uch a claim falls outside the purview of Practice Book \u00a7 43-22\" for the reason that it attacked an underlying conviction, not the sentence imposed. The defendant did not file a written opposition to the state's motion. On May 4, 2016, the court conducted a hearing on the motion to dismiss at which it heard arguments from both the state and defense counsel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On May 23, 2016, the court issued a memorandum of decision in which it dismissed in part and denied in part the defendant's motion to correct an illegal sentence. In particular, the court dismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction the defendant's first claim that the sentencing court failed to canvass the defendant or his counsel because \"such a claim is untenable\" pursuant to\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Parker\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4304713\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/295/825/#p840\">\n    295 Conn. at 825\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=992%20A.2d%201103\">\n    992 A.2d 1103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court denied on the merits the defendant's second claim that the sentencing court relied on inaccurate information because it concluded that \"the sentencing court did not rely on materially false or prejudicial information. The defendant was in fact convicted in 1991 of the crimes referenced in the [2001 PSI report].... The record before this court does not support the defendant's claim that the information regarding the 1991 convictions was materially false.\" (Citations omitted; footnote omitted.)

At the outset of the sentencing hearing, defense counsel argued in support of the motion that the state's synopsis detailing the facts underlying the 2001 convictions should be stricken because it contained numerous inaccuracies, including that the defendant never registered as a sex offender in connection with his 1991 convictions. The court afforded defense counsel the opportunity to go through all of the purported inaccuracies, but counsel declined to do so. The court then denied the defendant's motion and, in accordance with defense counsel's request, ordered that the motion, the transcript, and the court's order denying the motion be attached to the 2001 PSI report.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-44\">\n    The state, during its remarks at the sentencing hearing, recited some of the facts that were the basis for the 1991 convictions. Defense counsel objected to those statements as being unnecessary and redundant because the events leading to those convictions were set forth in the 2001 PSI report. Defense counsel did not object on the ground that any of that information was inaccurate, and neither defense counsel nor the defendant during their sentencing remarks claimed that the information regarding the 1991 convictions contained in the 2001 PSI report was inaccurate.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-45\">\n    Practice Book \u00a7 43-22 provides: \"The judicial authority may at any time correct an illegal sentence or other illegal disposition, or it may correct a sentence imposed in an illegal manner or any other disposition made in an illegal manner.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"6\">\n   <p id=\"p-46\">\n    On August 26, 2014, the defendant, as a self-represented party, filed a motion to correct an illegal sentence that claimed that his sentence had been imposed in an illegal manner because the sentencing court \"relied on false information and perjured statements-which influenced [its] sentencing decisions.\" The defendant then filed the amended motion to correct an illegal sentence after he had been appointed counsel.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"7\">\n   <p id=\"p-47\">\n    The defendant argues on appeal that the trial court misinterpreted his amended motion to correct as alleging two distinct claims. Rather, the defendant asserts that his sole claim was that \"his sentence was imposed in an illegal manner due to the fact that the court failed to canvass either him or his counsel as to the accuracy of the information contained within the [2001 PSI report] (and supplemental materials provided by the state), which in turn caused the court to rely on inaccurate information about his prior conviction when imposing his sentence on the underlying conviction.\" We disagree with the defendant's interpretation and, thus, separately consider his two claims, as they were raised and decided before the trial court.
