Cohen. On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the court erred by rejecting her request to charge and failing to instruct the jury that the possessor of real property\n   has a nondelegable duty to maintain the premises. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The record discloses the following facts that the jury reasonably could have found on the basis of the evidence presented at trial. On January 19, 2014, the defendants owned the premises at 390 West Main Street, New Britain, where the plaintiff was a tenant in a second floor apartment. At approximately 11:45 that morning, the plaintiff was carrying a basket of laundry down the rear, exterior stairs of the premises when she fell and sustained serious injuries to her left leg and ankle.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The plaintiff commenced a defective premises action against the defendants in January, 2016.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff alleged that her injuries were proximately caused by the defendants' negligence in that they\n   failed to keep the stairs free of dirt and sand; permitted the steps to become pitted, worn, and uneven; and failed to warn of the slippery condition of the stairs. The defendants denied the material allegations of the complaint and alleged certain special defenses in that the plaintiff's injuries were the result of her own negligence.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff denied the allegations of the special defenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   At trial, Robert Cohen testified, among other things, that he owned several properties and that three or four\n   people worked with him to maintain the premises. He hired a contractor to take care of the lawn and remove snow. The plaintiff submitted a request to charge\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and proposed jury interrogatories.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court declined to use the plaintiff's proposed charge and did not submit the interrogatories to the jury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Following the presentation of evidence, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the defendants. The plaintiff thereafter filed a motion\n   to set aside the verdict on the ground that (1) the verdict was contrary to law in that the court failed to properly charge the jury in accordance with her request to charge, (2) the court failed to submit her proposed jury interrogatories to the jury, and (3) the verdict was against\n   the evidence. The plaintiff also filed a motion for a new trial. The defendants objected to both the plaintiff's motion to set aside the verdict and her motion for a new trial. The court denied the plaintiff's motion to set aside the verdict and her motion for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The plaintiff appealed and thereafter filed a motion for articulation with the trial court. The court granted the motion for articulation and stated: \"The factual and legal basis for the court's not charging on nondelegable duty are set forth in [the] defendants' memorandum [of law] in support of [their] objection to [the] plaintiff's motion for a new trial .... The court specifically adopted the legal basis and factual analysis in its ruling. There was no evidence or argument that anyone other than the defendants [were] responsible for the maintenance of the stairway.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the court erred in refusing to give her proposed charge that the possessor of real property has a nondelegable duty to maintain the premises in a reasonably safe condition for invitees. During oral argument before us, we asked the parties whether the appeal was controlled by the general verdict rule and invited counsel to submit supplemental briefs on the question.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   We now conclude that review of the plaintiff's appeal is precluded by the general verdict rule.

In the present case, the defendants denied the allegations of the complaint and pleaded special defenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   \"The general verdict rule provides that if a jury renders a general verdict for one party, and no party requests interrogatories, an appellate court will presume that the jury found every issue in favor of the prevailing party .... In circumstances in which a party has requested interrogatories that fail to flesh out the basis of the jury's verdict, this court has noted that the general verdict rule is still applicable because [i]t is not the\n   <em>\n    mere submission\n   </em>\n   of interrogatories that enables [the reviewing court] to make that determination; rather, it is the submission of properly framed interrogatories that discloses the grounds for the jury's decision .... [I]n a case in which the general verdict rule operates, if any ground for the verdict is proper, the verdict must stand; only if every ground is improper does the verdict fall ....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   \"On the appellate level, the rule relieves an appellate court from the necessity of adjudicating claims of error that may not arise from the actual source of the jury verdict that is under appellate review. In a typical general verdict rule case, the\n   record is silent regarding whether the jury verdict resulted from the issue that the appellate seeks to have adjudicated. Declining in\n   such a case to afford appellate scrutiny of the appellant's claims is consistent with the general principle of appellate jurisprudence that it is the appellant's responsibility to provide a record upon which reversible error may be predicated.\" (Citations omitted; emphasis in original; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Beckenstein Enterprises-Prestige Park, LLC\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Keller\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4063908\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/115/680/#p685\">\n    115 Conn.

That is precisely the situation in the present case. The defendants denied the plaintiff's allegation that they failed to maintain the stairs where she fell. They also pleaded special defenses that alleged that the plaintiff was comparatively negligent in several ways. The jury returned a general verdict in favor of the defendants. Interrogatories were not submitted to the jury. We, therefore, do not know whether it found that the defendants were not negligent or that the plaintiff was more than 50 percent negligent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Although the plaintiff requested that interrogatories be submitted to the jury, the court did not do so and the plaintiff failed to object. See footnote 5 of this opinion. \"This court has stated that the failure of the plaintiffs to object to jury deliberation without interrogatories is the functional equivalent of a failure to request interrogatories.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Malaguit\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ski Sundown, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6779457\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/136/381/#p387\">\n    136 Conn.

Moreover, the plaintiff has not claimed on appeal that the court erred by failing to submit her interrogatories\n   to the jury. For the foregoing reasons, the plaintiff's claim on appeal is not reviewable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-24\">\n    The plaintiff's complaint sounded in three counts: common-law negligence, violation of the municipal housing code, and violation of the state housing code.
