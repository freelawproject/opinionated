We disagree and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to this appeal. On June 23, 2010, the plaintiff, representing herself, commenced an action in the Superior Court seeking payment from the board for legal services she allegedly provided in 2010 to Andrew Cimmino, a defendant in an action brought in federal court; see\n   <em>\n    Lyddy\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Cimmino\n   </em>\n   , United States District Court, Docket No. 3:06CV01420 (CFD) (D. Conn.); whom the plaintiff alleged was entitled to a defense and indemnification by the board pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 7-101a (a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Board of Education\n   </em>\n   , Superior Court, judicial district of Fairfield, Docket No. CV-10-6011406-S (2010 action). The claims raised by the plaintiff in the 2010 action sounded in quantum meruit and unjust enrichment. On July 10, 2012, the court dismissed the 2010 action on the basis of the plaintiff's failure to appear at trial. On July 24, 2012, the plaintiff filed a timely motion for reconsideration of the judgment of dismissal. On November 19, 2012, the trial court denied the plaintiff's motion for reconsideration. On December 10, 2012, the plaintiff appealed from the judgment of dismissal to this court, which affirmed the judgment on October 1, 2013.

See\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Board of Education\n   </em>\n   , Superior Court, judicial district of Danbury, Docket No. CV-12-6010257-S (2012 action). In\n   the 2012 action, the plaintiff asserted race discrimination claims against the board and Anastasi, the city attorney, in his official and individual capacities, pursuant to\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=42%20U.S.C.%20%C2%A7%201981\">\n    42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The plaintiff did not raise, however, a claim of quantum meruit or unjust enrichment in the 2012 action and did not purport to file the 2012 action pursuant to \u00a7 52-592. On August 31, 2012, the board filed a notice of removal of the 2012 action to the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut. On July 30, 2014, the federal District Court ordered, among other things, that the 2012 action be dismissed with prejudice as a sanction pursuant to rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure for the plaintiff's knowingly making false allegations in the complaint. See\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Board of Education\n   </em>\n   , United States District Court, Docket No. 3:12CV01287 (JAM),\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2014%20WL%203738057\">\n    2014 WL 3738057\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (D. Conn. July 30, 2014). On September 27, 2014, the plaintiff filed a notice of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. On December 10, 2014, the Second Circuit issued a mandate dismissing the plaintiff's appeal, effective October 29, 2014.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On May 6, 2015, the plaintiff commenced the present action against the board and Anastasi in his official and individual capacities, asserting claims sounding in\n   quantum meruit and unjust enrichment. On August 17, 2015, after obtaining the court's permission, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint, which added the city as a defendant. On November 16, 2015, the defendants filed an answer and special defenses. On November 18, 2016, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss asserting, inter alia, that the present action was commenced beyond the one year savings provision of \u00a7 52-592 (a). On April 7, 2017, the trial court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss, concluding that (1) the plaintiff could not avail herself of \u00a7 52-592 (a) because the dismissal of the 2010 action resulted from the plaintiff's lack of diligence and her failure to appear at trial, and not one\n   of the grounds set forth in the statute to render it a qualifying failed action; and (2) even if the plaintiff could avail herself of \u00a7 52-592 (a), the plaintiff had failed to commence the present action within one year after the determination of the 2010 action, which was the original action for purposes of \u00a7 52-592 (a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   \"We first set forth our standard of review governing motions to dismiss. Our standard of review of a trial court's findings of fact and conclusions of law in connection with a motion to dismiss is well settled. A finding of fact will not be disturbed unless it is clearly erroneous.... [W]here the legal conclusions of the court are challenged, we must determine whether they are legally and logically correct and whether they find support in the facts .... Thus, our review of the trial court's ultimate legal conclusion and resulting [granting] of the motion to dismiss will be de novo.... A motion to dismiss admits all facts well pleaded and invokes any record that accompanies the motion, including supporting affidavits that contain undisputed facts.\" (Footnote omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Stevenson\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Peerless Industries, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2219110\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/72/601/#p606\">\n    72 Conn.

Specifically, she argues: (1) the court improperly concluded that \u00a7 52-592 (a) was not available to her based\n   on its finding that the 2010 action was dismissed as a result of her lack of diligence and her failure to appear at trial; and (2) the court improperly concluded that, even if \u00a7 52-592 (a) were available to her, she failed to commence the present action within the one year savings period.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   We conclude that, even if we assume, arguendo, that the plaintiff could avail herself of \u00a7 52-592 (a), she failed to commence the present action within the one year savings period.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Section 52-592 (a) provides in relevant part: \"If any action, commenced within the time limited by law, has failed one or more times to be tried on its merits because of insufficient service or return of the writ due to unavoidable accident or the default or neglect of the officer to whom it was committed, or because the action has been dismissed for want of jurisdiction, or the action has been otherwise avoided or defeated ... for\n   any matter of form; or if, in any such action after a verdict for the plaintiff, the judgment has been set aside, or if a judgment of nonsuit has been rendered or a judgment for the plaintiff reversed, the plaintiff ... may commence a new action ... for the same cause at any time\n   <em>\n    within one year after the determination of the original action\n   </em>\n   or after the reversal of the judgment.\" (Emphasis added.) \"[U]nder the provisions of \u00a7 52-592 (a) 'original action' means the first action filed within the time allowed by the applicable statute of limitations.\"\n   <em>\n    Pintavalle\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Valkanos\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"520827\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/216/412/#p419\">\n    216 Conn. 412\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 419,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=581%20A.2d%201050\">\n    581 A.2d 1050\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1990).

See\n   <em>\n    Peabody N.E., Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Dept. of Transportation\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1237111\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/250/105/#p118\">\n    250 Conn. 105\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 118,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=735%20A.2d%20782\">\n    735 A.2d 782\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1999) (concluding that subsequent action in which plaintiff \"relies upon the same facts, makes the same allegations, and seeks the same relief\" is action for same cause).\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Thus, to take advantage of \u00a7 52-592 (a), the plaintiff would\n   have had to commence the present action within one year after the \"determination\" of the 2010 action.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On December 10, 2012, after the trial court had denied her motion for reconsideration on November 19, 2012, the plaintiff appealed from the July 10, 2012 judgment dismissing the 2010 action, which this court affirmed on October 1, 2013. Excluding the time that the 2010 action was\n   pending upon appeal; see \u00a7 52-592 (c) ; we conclude that the one year savings period under \u00a7 52-592 (a) expired in 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Having commenced the present action in May, 2015, the plaintiff could not take advantage of the savings statute.

In addition, as an alternative ground for affirmance, the defendants argue that the plaintiff lacks standing to bring a direct claim for indemnification under General Statutes \u00a7 7-101a against a municipality. We note that, although the defendants frame their argument as one of standing, the plaintiff did not assert a statutory claim under \u00a7 7-101a. Rather, her claims sound in quantum meruit and unjust enrichment, while relying on allegations that Cimmino was entitled to a defense and indemnity by the board pursuant to \u00a7 7-101a.
