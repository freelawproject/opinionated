I, \u00a7 180-2 (1998). We affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <em>\n    I. Background\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The following facts are drawn from the trial court's order on the defendants' motion to dismiss or are otherwise supported by the record. On May 28, 2016, Pierro went to Endicott Park Beach in Laconia. At the hearing on the defendants' motion to dismiss, Pierro testified that she \"was topless\" and was there \"to enjoy the beach.\" She agreed with defense counsel that she was \"performing yoga on the beach.\" She stated that she \"was violently harassed\" by \"[s]everal citizens,\" but that \"out of everybody on the beach, there were only actually a handful that were upset.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Sergeant Black of the Laconia Police Department testified that, on that same day, he and Officer Callanan responded to the beach because the department had \"received several calls about a female ... doing nude yoga.\" Callanan testified that they approached a woman, later identified as Pierro, who was \"not wearing any shirt and her breasts, as well as her nipples, were both exposed.\" Callanan stated that she \"made attempts to speak to\" Pierro, but that Pierro \"continued to do her yoga poses.\" She explained that \"after about a minute or so, [Pierro] looked up and acknowledged that we were, in fact, trying to speak to her.\" She testified that they \"explained to [Pierro] that the reason [they] were making contact with her was in reference to a Laconia City Ordinance, since her nipples were exposed on the beach in a public place.\" Callanan stated that they asked Pierro \"multiple times to cover up, to put her bathing suit top back on, or put her shirt back on,\" but that Pierro \"refused.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Callanan testified that Pierro was arrested for violating Laconia City Ordinance \u00a7 180-2 (the ordinance), which states, in relevant part, that \"it shall be unlawful for any person to knowingly or intentionally, in a public place: ... [a]ppear in a state of nudity.\" \"Nudity\" is defined as \"[t]he showing of the human male or female genitals, pubic area or buttocks with less than a fully opaque covering,\n   or the showing of the female breast with less than a fully opaque covering of any part of the nipple.\"\n   <em>\n    Laconia, N.H., Code of Ordinances\n   </em>\n   ch. 180, art. I, \u00a7 180-4 (1998).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In 2015, Sinclair became involved in the \"Free the Nipple\" movement. Sinclair testified that she was one of the people who \"started\" the movement in New Hampshire after having her son and realizing \"that there was a very big stigma on breastfeeding.\" She explained that she believed that breasts, specifically nipples, are \"hypersexualize[d]\" and \"consider[ed] pornographic and taboo,\" which she stated results \"in that stigma\" and \"contributes to the low breastfeeding rates that the United States has\n   compared to the rest of the world.\" Sinclair told Lilley about the movement, which Lilley then joined. Lilley testified that she is \"a feminist\" and joined the movement because she \"believe[s] in the equality of the male and female.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On May 31, 2016, Sinclair and Lilley went topless to Weirs Beach in Laconia. While at the beach, they were arrested for violating the ordinance. Sinclair testified that she \"purposely engaged in civil disobedience knowing that the City of Laconia has an ordinance against the exposure of the female nipple and areola.\" She stated that she was \"protesting [Pierro's] case where she had been arrested a few days prior.\" Lilley testified that she was also protesting Pierro's arrest and that she \"announced to the arresting police officer that [she] was acting in a protest and that [she] did not believe that [she] could be arrested for protesting.\" She further agreed with the prosecutor that, on that day, she \"chose to take it upon [herself] to violate the ordinance to give attention to [her] cause.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The defendants jointly moved to dismiss the charges against them. They argued that the ordinance violates the guarantee of equal protection and their right to free speech under the State and Federal Constitutions. They further contended that the City of Laconia lacked the authority to enact the ordinance and that the ordinance was preempted by RSA 645:1 (2016). Finally, the defendants maintained that the ordinance violates RSA chapter 354-A.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   RSA ch. 354-A (2009 &amp; Supp. 2017) (amended 2018). The State objected. Following a hearing, the court denied the defendants' motion. The court subsequently found the defendants guilty of violating the ordinance. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On appeal, the defendants argue that the trial court erred by denying their motion to dismiss because the ordinance: (1) violates their right to equal protection under the State and Federal Constitutions; (2) violates their rights to free speech and expression under the State and Federal Constitutions; (3) does not fall within the regulatory authority granted to the City of Laconia by the legislature; (4) is preempted by RSA 645:1 ; and (5) violates RSA chapter 354-A. We will address each of the defendants' arguments in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <em>\n    II. Equal Protection\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The defendants first argue that the ordinance violates their right to equal protection under Part I, Article 2 of the New Hampshire Constitution and the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.H.

An appellant may challenge the constitutionality of a statute or an ordinance\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   by asserting a facial challenge, an as-applied challenge, or both.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    State v.

A facial challenge is a head-on attack of a legislative judgment, an assertion that the challenged statute violates the Constitution in all, or virtually all, of its applications.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=53%20A.3d%20591\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=53%20A.3d%20591\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   To prevail on a facial challenge, the challenger must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the challenged statute or ordinance would be valid.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=53%20A.3d%20591\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=53%20A.3d%20591\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n   On the other hand, an as-applied challenge concedes that the statute may be constitutional in many of its applications, but contends that it is not so under the particular circumstances of the case.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=53%20A.3d%20591\">\n     Id\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=53%20A.3d%20591\">\n    .\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Here, the defendants do not concede that the relevant portion of the ordinance is constitutional in any circumstance. They argue that \"the ordinance makes a gender-based classification on its face.\" We construe their claim to be a facial challenge to the portion of the ordinance that prohibits \"the showing of the female breast with less than a fully opaque covering of any part of the nipple\" in a public place.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Laconia, N.H., Code of Ordinances\n   </em>\n   ch. 180, art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 180-2, 180-4.

However, as demonstrated by the lack of any meaningful discussion of our precedent in the dissent, we have little in the way of help from our own cases in answering this question. Although we applied strict scrutiny to a gender-based classification in\n   <em>\n    Holbrook\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Holbrook\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2290890\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nh/140/187/#p189\">\n    140 N.H. at 189-90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=663%20A.2d%201344\">\n    663 A.2d 1344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , as already discussed, the law at issue in\n   <em>\n    Holbrook\n   </em>\n   did not impose requirements on both men and women. The dissent identifies no other instance, nor are we aware of any, in which we have concluded that a law challenged on equal protection grounds contained a gender-based classification and therefore was subject to strict scrutiny.\n   <em>\n    But cf\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    In re Certain Scholarship Funds\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4420381\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nh/133/227/#p231\">\n    133 N.H. 227\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 231,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=575%20A.2d%201325\">\n    575 A.2d 1325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1990) (concluding that the \"State's participation in the administration of\" certain scholarships established by trust but expressly limited to one gender \"cannot even withstand the lowest level of judicial scrutiny,\" and thus declining to \"determine what level of review should be employed in cases of gender ... discrimination\" under Part I, Article 2 ). Thus, our prior cases are not helpful in analyzing whether Laconia's ordinance is gender-based. In other words, to the extent the dissent contends that our precedent requires us to determine the standard of review in equal protection challenges by examining the purpose and scope of the State-created classification, we agree. The primary issue on\n   which\n   <em>\n    this\n   </em>\n   case turns, however, is what that examination reveals when applied to the unique facts of this case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   We agree with the dissent, of course, that this court has a duty \"to make an independent determination of the protections afforded in the New Hampshire Constitution.\"\n   <em>\n    Ball\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4405831\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nh/124/226/#p231\">\n    124 N.H. at 231\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=471%20A.2d%20347\">\n    471 A.2d 347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Indeed, the dissent itself relies on out-of-jurisdiction cases to support its contention that the Laconia ordinance contains a gender-based classification. To the extent the dissent simply finds those cases more persuasive, that is all the more reason for us, in fulfilling our obligation to independently interpret Part I, Article 2, to consider the full range of how courts have tackled this difficult question, lest we simply pick and choose from amongst courts whose holdings align with our own personal ideologies.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   The dissent also contends that there is \"no principled reason why\" our approach to analyzing Laconia's ordinance \"would not apply with equal force to other laws\" that afford differing treatment to people of different races, religions, colors, or national origins. We disagree. The facts of this case, including the particular way in which men and women differ with respect to the traditional understanding of nudity, are unique. Indeed, the dissent does not even attempt to deny that nudity is simply different for men than for women. At the same time, it is undeniably true that classifications based on immutable characteristics have \"long [been] recognized as in most circumstances irrelevant,\"\n   <em>\n    Adarand Constructors, Inc. v.

However, based on the unique way in which men and women differ with respect to nudity, we conclude that the ordinance does not afford different treatment for men and women based on gender. As for the dissent's assertion that, given our approach to analyzing Laconia's ordinance, we would not apply strict scrutiny in a case that concerned laws imposing more onerous retirement benefit requirements for women than for men, it suffices to say that any such case would be controlled by our analysis in\n   <em>\n    Holbrook\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Holbrook\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2290890\" index=\"128\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nh/140/187/#p189\">\n    140 N.H. at 189-90\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"129\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=663%20A.2d%201344\">\n    663 A.2d 1344\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   At various points throughout its opinion, the dissent lumps the ordinance, and our analysis of it, together with \"pervasive and perverse discrimination,\" \"romantic paternalism,\" \"unexamined stereotypes,\" and \"archaic prejudice.\" The resort to such hyperbole reveals the flawed nature of its reasoning. It assumes that, because the ordinance does not allow men and women to engage in precisely the same mode of dress, it must contain a gender-based classification. Respectfully, we find this approach deceptively simplistic. For strict scrutiny to apply, it is not enough that men and women be treated differently: they must be treated differently based upon a gender-based classification.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Buchanan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"130\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=584%20P.2d%20918\">\n    584 P.2d at 921-22\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . For the reasons already discussed, we find no gender-based classification in the ordinance. It is telling that the dissent has identified no case, nor are we aware of any, in which a court sitting in a jurisdiction with an Equal Rights Amendment analogous to our own has applied strict scrutiny to an ordinance like Laconia's. Neither can we ignore that no court with precedent-setting authority has held such an ordinance unconstitutional.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Nor should the siren call of \"equal rights\" lead us to forget our constitutional role.

Public nudity ordinances such as the ordinances in Chicago and Laconia -\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , those that use explicit, gendered language to make it unlawful for a female to engage in certain behavior, while the same behavior is lawful for a male - clearly classify by gender. The majority asserts that such reasoning is \"flawed\" and \"deceptively simple.\" We fail to see the flaw or deception in our simple reasoning: when a law uses the word \"female\" to classify between those who can violate the ordinance - females - and those who cannot - males - it contains a gender-based classification. We freely acknowledge that the question of whether basic\n   physiological differences between the sexes\n   <em>\n    justify\n   </em>\n   disparate treatment of men and women is a more nuanced and complicated question. But classification and justification present different questions. Respectfully, we find the reasoning of the majority - which obscures the simple threshold question - needlessly convoluted and artificially complex.\n   Indeed, a court upends the safeguards of equal protection if it reasons that, because a law is premised upon physiological or anatomical differences between the sexes, the law does not classify by gender and therefore it need not be analyzed under strict scrutiny. For example, because women have a longer life expectancy than men, by the majority's reasoning, a hypothetical law that mandates that women work four years longer than men in order to qualify for a pension, or prevents women from retiring until age 70 as opposed to age 66 for men, or reduces a woman's social security benefits if she retires at the same age as a man, does not classify on the basis of gender. Such a law would be constitutional so long as it was \"rationally related to a legitimate government interest.\"\n   <em>\n    Boulders\n   </em>\n   , 153 N.H. at 641,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"268\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=903%20A.2d%201021\">\n    903 A.2d 1021\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Analyzing whether a law comports with equal protection does not require that the court be blind to basic physiological or anatomical differences. In some cases, applying the constitutionally required level of scrutiny, this court might conclude that such differences justify disparate treatment under the law. However, a court subverts the basic guarantee of equal protection if it concludes that, because men and women have physiological or anatomical differences, a law that classifies on the basis of those differences does not trigger strict scrutiny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   The New Hampshire Constitution states: \"Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by this state on account of race, creed,\n   color, sex or national origin.\" N.H. CONST. pt. I, art. 2. This guarantee became part of our State Constitution in 1974 after the people of New Hampshire passed the Equal Rights Amendment by an overwhelming margin. There is no counterpart to New Hampshire's Equal Rights Amendment in the United States Constitution. Accordingly, we, like courts in other states whose citizens have adopted an Equal Rights Amendment, do not \"equate our [Equal Rights Amendment] with the equal protection clause of the federal constitution\" as doing so \"would negate its meaning given that our state adopted an [Equal Rights Amendment] while the federal government failed to do so.\"\n   <em>\n    Doe v.

Here, there is no evidence that the City of Laconia considered gender-neutral alternatives and the State has made no argument and presented no evidence as to why gender-neutral alternatives would not suffice. At oral argument the State asserted that the ordinance was \"fairly\n   narrowly tailored\" because a woman need only \"wear pasties\" including \"pasties that look like nipples.\" However, it failed to explain why the ordinance was necessary in the first place or why a less restrictive ordinance, perhaps one more narrow in time or place, would be insufficient. By the ordinance's plain language, it is perfectly lawful for a post-pubescent female to wear pasties with tassels walking down Laconia's Main Street, even though a four-year-old girl playing on the beach wearing only shorts, or an adult woman sunbathing without a top in her own back yard, engages in unlawful behavior if her nipples are \"visible to the public.\"\n   <em>\n    Laconia, N.H., Code of Ordinances\n   </em>\n   ch. 180, art.

We reach this conclusion after objectively applying strict scrutiny as required by our precedent and Part I, Article 2. In so concluding, we do not mean to imply that all legislation that classifies on the basis of gender would not survive the strict scrutiny test, nor that Laconia's ordinance might not have passed constitutional muster had the State accepted that it bore the burden of proof; rather, we find that the State's proof in this case falls far short of satisfying strict scrutiny.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   Although laws that classify on the basis of gender are subject to strict scrutiny under the New Hampshire Constitution, it does not follow that all such laws will be invalidated by application of that exacting standard. \"The fact that strict scrutiny applies says nothing about the ultimate validity of any particular law; that determination is the job of the court applying strict scrutiny.\"\n   <em>\n    Johnson v.

The suggestion is that we, as judges, should interpret and apply the constitution as it exists, not as we think it ought to exist. On this point, we agree.

However, perhaps mindful of\n   the State's obvious failure to present evidence sufficient to meet the exacting burden of strict scrutiny in this case, the majority strains to conclude that an ordinance that prohibits women - but not men - from engaging in certain behavior does not discriminate on the basis of sex, but is, in fact, gender-neutral.
