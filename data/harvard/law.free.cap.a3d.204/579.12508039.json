(Mid-Atlantic) appeals from the March 27, 2018 Order of the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County (common pleas) denying Mid-Atlantic's appeal from the Decision of a Tax Hearing Officer (THO) of the Tax Office of the Municipality of Monroeville (Tax Office). The THO denied Mid-Atlantic's Consolidated Tax Appeal and Petition for Refund of Business Privilege Taxes for Tax Years 2012 to 2016 (Tax Appeal) and found that Mid-Atlantic owed $ 51,712.15 in additional Business Privilege\n   Taxes (BPT), penalties, and interest. On appeal, Mid-Atlantic argues the Municipality of Monroeville (Monroeville) cannot assess the BPT against it because Monroeville is precluded from doing so by Section 12 of the Home Improvement Consumer Protection Act\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   (HICPA) and Subsections 301.1(f)(1) and (f)(11) of the Local Tax Enabling Act\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   (LTEA). Mid-Atlantic further asserts that, because Monroeville's taxing scheme as applied to it is invalid under HICPA and the LTEA, that scheme violates the Uniformity Clause of the Pennsylvania Constitution\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Finally, Mid-Atlantic seeks the abatement of the penalties, interest, and costs as permitted by Monroeville's BPT Regulations. Discerning no error, we affirm.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   <em>\n    A. Monroeville's BPT Ordinance and Regulations\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Section 3.A of Monroeville's Ordinance 2329 (BPT Ordinance), enacted pursuant to the LTEA, assesses \"an annual tax ... on each dollar of volume of the gross annual receipts\" on \"[e]very person engaging in any business in the Municipality ....\" (Reproduced Record (R.R.) at 97a.) The BPT \"is a tax on the privilege of doing business in ... Monroeville.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 122a.) For corporations, the BPT is calculated on the corporation's gross receipts. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 121a.) In order to ascertain what businesses are subject to the BPT, Monroeville's BPT Regulations state that anyone \"desiring to do business in ... Monroeville [is] required to obtain a business privilege ... license (business license) ....\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 110a;\n   <em>\n    see also\n   </em>\n   Section 5 of the BPT Ordinance, R.R. at 98a.) To obtain a business license, Monroeville requires the completion and filing of a business registration form with Monroeville's Tax Collector and payment of a yearly fee of $ 25.00. (R.R. at 113a.) If a business owes taxes to Monroeville, including the BPT, no license will be issued. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) An entity that engages in business in Monroeville without obtaining a license can be subject to a penalty and fine. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 116a.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   <em>\n    B. Monroeville's Assessment of the BPT Against Mid-Atlantic\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Mid-Atlantic is a Pennsylvania corporation that \"improv[es] real property through customization, installation and application of basement waterproofing materials, technologies and techniques.\" (Common Pleas 1925(a) Opinion (1925(a) Op.) at 2.) It began its business operations in Monroeville on March 1, 2012, and this location is its principal place of business. Mid-Atlantic registered with the Tax Collector, obtaining a business license and paying the annual business license fee for the tax years 2012 through 2016 (Reassessment Years). It also filed BPT returns\n   and paid that tax in the Reassessment Years. In August 2016, the Tax Office requested Mid-Atlantic to provide records of its gross receipts for the Reassessment Years. Upon reviewing those records, the Tax Office issued Notices of Assessment, assessing additional BPTs, penalties, and interest based on Mid-Atlantic's purported failure to report all of its gross receipts. After an informal conference to discuss excluding Mid-Atlantic's gross receipts from the BPT and an abatement, the Tax Office rejected Mid-Atlantic's arguments and abatement request.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Mid-Atlantic filed an appeal with the Tax Office.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Tax Office requested that Mid-Atlantic submit additional records to support claims made in that appeal. Thereafter, the Tax Office issued Revised Notices of Assessment, which reflected adjustments based on the additional records:\n  </p>\n  <pre id=\"p-16\"><strong>BPT</strong> <strong>Additional</strong> <strong>Year</strong> <strong>Reported</strong> <strong><em>Adjusted</em></strong> <strong>Assessed</strong> <strong>Penalties</strong> <strong>Interest</strong> <strong>Total</strong> 2012 $0.00 $3,818.07 $3,818.07 $1,164.51 $1,164.51 $6,147.09 2013 $74.95 $4,581.69 $4,506.74 $1,104.15 $1,104.15 $6,715.04 2014 $179.88 $9,450.79 $9,270.91 $1,715.12 $1,715.12 $12,701.15 2015 $205.81 $11,382.12 $11,176.31 $1,397.04 $1,397.04 $13,970.39 2016 $0.00 $10,277.42 $10,277.42 $668.03 $668.03 $12,178.48 <strong>Total</strong> $460.64 $39,510.09 <strong>$39,049.45</strong> $6,048.85 $6,048.85 <strong>$51,712.15</strong></pre>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   (R.R. at 174a (emphasis in original).) Mid-Atlantic timely filed a BPT return for 2017 and paid $ 6,056 under protest.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   <em>\n    C. Mid-Atlantic's Tax Appeal and the THO's Decision\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On July 31, 2017, Mid-Atlantic filed the Tax Appeal,\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   asserting Monroeville improperly assessed the BPT against it. Therein, it sought relief related to the Reassessment Years (2012-2016).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mid-Atlantic first argued that Monroeville could not assess the BPT and related penalties and interest against Mid-Atlantic because Monroeville was preempted from doing so by Section 12 of HICPA, which states that \"[r]egistration under [HICPA] shall preclude any requirement of payment of a fee or registration or licensing of any home improvement contractor by any political subdivision,\" 73 P.S. \u00a7 517.12. Mid-Atlantic asserted it could not be made to pay the BPT because doing so required it to register and obtain a license from Monroeville.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The THO rejected this argument, holding there is a distinction between the licensing or registration of an entity or person and the taxation of the privilege of doing business within a municipality under the LTEA. (Decision at 3.) The assessment of the BPT and the related registration/licensing requirement on Mid-Atlantic, the\n   THO reasoned, was not based on Mid-Atlantic's status as a home improvement contractor or the intention of regulating Mid-Atlantic's contracting business, but on the privilege of Mid-Atlantic conducting its business operation within Monroeville. The BPT and the registration/licensing requirements, the THO explained, were \"imposed upon\n   <strong>\n    all\n   </strong>\n   business enterprises in [Monroeville] which may be lawfully subject to the tax pursuant to the LTEA.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (emphasis added).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The THO additionally rejected Mid-Atlantic's attempt to \"bootstrap\" the HICPA's prohibition against local registration and licensing of home improvement contractors to the assessment of the BPT. The THO concluded this argument was not supported by the Supreme Court's decision in\n   <em>\n    City of Philadelphia v. Clement &amp; Muller, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"559367\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/552/317/\">\n    552 Pa. 317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11705332,559367\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/715/397/\">\n    715 A.2d 397\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 398 (1998), which described the boundaries of preemption. (Decision at 4.) The THO observed that, even if Monroeville's licensing/registration scheme was preempted, this did not lead to the conclusion that Mid-Atlantic was not subject to the BPT. According to the THO, the intended target of Section 12 of HICPA was clear on its face and was limited to the registration and licensing of home improvement contractors in order to regulate those entities' construction activities. Because of that clear target, the \"permitted\" \"outer bounds\" of that preemption could be determined and did not include the preemption of the assessment of a BPT. (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    City of Philadelphia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11705332,559367\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/715/397/\">\n    715 A.2d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   398 ).)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Mid-Atlantic next argued it does not have to pay the BPT, citing Subsections 301.1(f)(1) and (f)(11) of the LTEA. Subsection (f)(1), Mid-Atlantic asserted, excepts certain activities \"from any tax ... on a privilege, ... subject, [or] occupation ... which is now or does hereafter become\n   <strong>\n    subject to a State tax or license fee\n   </strong>\n   ,\" 53 P.S. \u00a7 6924.301.1(f)(1) (emphasis added), and, citing\n   <em>\n    National Biscuit Co. v.

Subsection (f)(11) likewise supported an exception here, Mid-Atlantic argued, because that provision precludes taxation \"on the construction of or improvement to residential dwellings ...,\" 53 P.S. \u00a7 6924.301.1(f)(11), and Mid-Atlantic provides these services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The THO was unpersuaded by Mid-Atlantic's arguments and held that\n   <em>\n    National Biscuit\n   </em>\n   , as well as\n   <em>\n    School District of City of Scranton v.

Relying on the factors used by the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    National Biscuit\n   </em>\n   , such as the amount of the asserted fee, the nature of the fee, and the fee's purpose, the THO concluded that the HICPA registration fee is not a true license fee. As for the exception for construction and improvement to residential dwellings, the THO noted that both the Supreme Court, and this Court, rejected similar arguments in\n   <em>\n    Dale and Dale\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Alverno Valley Farms\n   </em>\n   , respectively.

(Decision at 6 (quoting\n   <em>\n    Fish\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12280905,6767689,6767734,12280895\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/128/764/\">\n    128 A.3d at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   770 ).) These decisions, the THO reasoned,\n   supported Monroeville's assessment of the BPT on Mid-Atlantic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Mid-Atlantic next argued that \"[i]n addition to violating the HICPA, Monroeville's business registration, licensing and taxation regime violates the Uniformity Clause of the Pennsylvania Constitution\" \"and the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution ... by resulting in the unequal treatment of a whole class of taxpayers, home improvement contractors.\" (Tax Appeal at 4, R.R. at 65a.) Reviewing Mid-Atlantic's argument, the THO found that Mid-Atlantic \"offer[ed] no specifics on precisely how these constitutional infirmities arise, only stating their existence in conclusory fashion,\" nor did it provide a \"specific explanation to support it[s] assertion that [Monroeville's] business registration, licensing and taxation scheme is unconstitutional.\" (Decision at 6-7.) Absent the averment of such facts, the THO held that Mid-Atlantic had not sustained its burden of establishing that Monroeville's assessment of the BPT \"clearly, palpably and plainly violate[d] the Constitution.\" (Decision at 7 (citing\n   <em>\n    City of Allentown v.

Mid-Atlantic's Appeal to Common Pleas\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Mid-Atlantic appealed to common pleas, which affirmed the THO's Decision. After filing an appeal with this Court, Mid-Atlantic filed, at common pleas' direction, a Concise Statement of Errors Complained of on Appeal (Statement) pursuant to Rule 1925(b) of the Pennsylvania Rules of Appellate Procedure, Pa.R.A.P. 1925(b). After reviewing the Statement, common pleas issued its 1925(a) Opinion, in which it held that the THO's findings were supported by substantial evidence, all local procedures were followed, and the THO did not err or violate the Constitutions by denying the Tax Appeal. Common pleas, therefore, adopted as its own the THO's findings, conclusions, and analysis for denying the Tax Appeal. Mid-Atlantic now appeals to this Court, reiterating many of the same arguments.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   <strong>\n    II. Mid-Atlantic's Appeal to this Court\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   <em>\n    A. Section 12 of HICPA\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Mid-Atlantic first argues, as a matter of first impression, that Section 12 of HICPA \"prohibits Monroeville from imposing\n   <strong>\n    any\n   </strong>\n   registration or licensing requirements on Mid-Atlantic.\" (Mid-Atlantic's Brief (Br.) at 9 (emphasis added).) This prohibition, Mid-Atlantic argues, extends to the assessment of the BPT because, under the BPT Regulations, the payment of the BPT is inseparable from a business's obligation to register with and obtain a license from Monroeville. Because it cannot be required to register and obtain a license from Monroeville under HICPA, Mid-Atlantic maintains it cannot be subject to the BPT. Further, Mid-Atlantic argues common pleas erred by finding that the BPT was enforceable against it as a \"permitted\" \"outer bounds\" under\n   <em>\n    City of Philadelphia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11705332,559367\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/715/397/\">\n    715 A.2d at 398\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Tax Office acknowledges that local taxation cannot intrude into preempted areas, but argues that the legislature is not presumed to have preempted an entire area\n   simply by legislating therein. Rather, the legislature must show an intent to preempt that field and, contrary to Mid-Atlantic's assertions, neither HICPA generally, nor Section 12 particularly, reflect an intent to preempt the assessment of local taxes on home improvement contractors. Instead, the scope of Section 12's preemption, Tax Office argues, is clear on its face and is aimed at registering home improvement contractors for the purposes of regulating their operational conduct. According to Tax Office, the purpose of the \"informational registration\" that Monroeville requires\n   <strong>\n    all business entities\n   </strong>\n   operating within its boundaries to undergo is to obtain the information necessary for it to exercise its taxing power, not to control the operational activities of those businesses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The doctrine of preemption \"provides, generally, that when the legislature has preempted a field the state has retained all regulatory and legislative power for itself and therefore prohibits local legislation in that area.\"\n   <em>\n    Nutter v.

On the issue of preemption and the assessment of local taxes, the Supreme Court has explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   There is generally no difficulty of application where a statute explicitly removes a given subject from local control. Similarly, where some local regulation is permitted its outer bounds can usually be clearly determined; municipal ordinances are valid if they are not contradictory to or inconsistent with the statutory law.

To meet that purpose, HICPA requires home improvement businesses wishing to conduct home improvement activities on private residences in Pennsylvania to register with the Bureau of Consumer Protection (Bureau), which maintains a database of registered contractors. Section 3 of HICPA, 73 P.S. \u00a7 517.3. HICPA further governs the contents of home improvement contracts and how those contracts can be enforced, creates the offense of \"[h]ome improvement fraud\" and directs who may prosecute that offense, sets forth what acts are prohibited under HICPA,\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   and provides that a violation of HICPA is a violation of the Unfair Trade Practices and Consumer Protection Law.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Sections 7-10 of HICPA, 73 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 517.7 - 517.10.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   Section 12 prohibits political subdivisions from registering, licensing, or charging a fee on any \"home improvement contractor\" registered under HICPA. 73 P.S. \u00a7 517.12. This is consistent with the general tenor of HICPA, which focuses on consumer protection, the creation of a centralized database of registered home improvement contractors to be used by consumers for informational purposes, and the punishment of contractors that engage in fraudulent or prohibited acts. To register under HICPA, contractors are required to provide the Bureau with certain information regarding their business, such as contact information, the names and addresses of each principal, the names and addresses of any prior home contractor businesses operated, and the names of any business registered or licensed in other jurisdictions. Sections 3 and 4 of HICPA, 73 P.S. \u00a7\u00a7 517.3, 517.4. By prohibiting the imposition of additional registration, licensing, or fees by political subdivisions, consumers are not forced to go to multiple sources for information and contractors are not burdened by multiple and/or differing registration requirements and fees.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   As the emphases of HICPA are on\n   ensuring that the relationship between the consumer and home improvement contractor is fair and protecting consumers from fraud, among other problems, it cannot be said to \"pervasive[ly] regulate[ ] ...\n   <strong>\n    every aspect of [the home improvement contractor] industry or profession.\n   </strong>\n   \"\n   <em>\n    Rose View Manor\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1449081\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-commw/157/410/#p477\">\n    630 A.2d at 477\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).

Permitting Monroeville to require Mid-Atlantic,\n   <strong>\n    the business\n   </strong>\n   , to register and obtain a license so that Monroeville may assess the BPT, is not inconsistent or in conflict with Section 12's prohibition against Monroeville requiring Mid-Atlantic,\n   <strong>\n    the home improvement contractor\n   </strong>\n   , to register and obtain a license in order for Mid-Atlantic to perform those construction activities within Monroeville.

Similar to the situation in\n   <em>\n    National Biscuit\n   </em>\n   , all businesses operating in Monroeville must register with the Tax Collector and pay a yearly $ 25.00 fee to obtain a business license.

It further maintains that HICPA's scope and regulation of home improvement contractors is broad and encompassing, and its specific language preempting local registration and licensing reflects the legislature's intent that the only regulation of home improvement contractors should be by the state.

It notes that the HICPA fee, even if paid by large numbers of home improvement contractors, is insufficient to finance the total regulation of the home improvement industry. The HICPA fee, Tax Office argues, is like the fee paid by realtors to their state regulators, which has been found not to preclude the imposition of the BPT under Subsection 301.1(f)(1).\n   <em>\n    Helsel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1395516\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-commw/129/1/#p547\">\n    564 A.2d at 547\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Subsection 301.1(f)(1) provides that \"local authorities shall not have authority by virtue of this act\" \"[t]o levy, assess and collect or provide for the levying, assessment and collection of any tax on ... a privilege, transaction, subject, occupation or personal property which is now or does hereafter become subject to a State tax or license fee.\" 53 P.S. \u00a7 6924.301.1(f)(1).

According to Tax Office, the BPT is not a tax on home improvement contractors' construction or renovation services, but on the privilege of their conducting business operations in Monroeville. The distinction between taxing the services a business entity provides and taxing the privilege of operating a business within a municipality was reiterated, Tax Office maintains, by a majority of the Supreme Court in\n   <em>\n    Fish\n   </em>\n   , notwithstanding a strong dissent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Subsection 301.1(f)(11) provides that \"local authorities shall not have authority by virtue of this act\" \"[t]o levy, assess or collect a tax on the construction of or improvement to residential dwellings ....\" 53 P.S. \u00a7 6924.301.1(f)(11). In\n   <em>\n    Alverno Valley Farms\n   </em>\n   , a contractor challenged a township's assessment of the BPT based on the contractor's gross receipts because, it argued, those gross receipts were earned\n   through its construction activities.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1358295\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-commw/105/311/\">\n    524 A.2d at 1040\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, it asserted, the BPT was the equivalent of taxing the construction of residential dwellings and, therefore, fell within this exception to the township's taxing authority. After observing that the legislature had not demonstrated an intent to control the entire building industry via comprehensive legislation and that the challenged tax would be valid so long as it did not duplicate another tax, we rejected the contractor's argument. In doing so, we explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-62\">\n   [t]he local tax in this case does not tax the same subject matter as specified in section 2(11) of the Act,\n   <sup>\n    [\n   </sup>\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   <sup>\n    ]\n   </sup>\n   nor is it measured by the same base. The local tax is a tax on the privilege to do business and it is measured by the gross volume, determined by receipts, of business conducted by the taxpayer, whereas the prohibition under section 2(11) of the Act addresses taxes on the construction of a residence, and thus has no relationship to the volume of business conducted. The impact of the two taxes is on a totally different basis. Carrying on a construction business, such as that in which appellee is engaged, involves much more than the construction of a residence. Section 2(11) of the Act therefore does not prohibit the local tax which was enacted pursuant to [the local o]rdinance.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1358295\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-commw/105/311/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1358295\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa-commw/105/311/\">\n    at 1040-41\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis omitted). In\n   <em>\n    Dale and Dale\n   </em>\n   , the Supreme Court, citing\n   <em>\n    Alverno Valley Farms\n   </em>\n   , held that the assessment of the BPT based on the gross receipts of a contractor was \"not a tax upon the construction of a residential dwelling or the issuance of a building permit, which is prohibited.\"\n   <em>\n    Dale and Dale\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11651332,837164\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/741/186/\">\n    741 A.2d at 189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Supreme Court, in\n   <em>\n    Fish\n   </em>\n   , explained it \"is established law in Pennsylvania that business privileges and transactions are separate and distinct subjects of taxation,\" and cited\n   <em>\n    Dale and Dale\n   </em>\n   as reflecting this distinction.\n   <em>\n    Fish\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12280905,6767689,6767734,12280895\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/128/764/\">\n    128 A.3d at 770\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   <em>\n    Dale and Dale\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Alverno Valley Farms\n   </em>\n   are directly on point and, as Tax Office argues, rejected the argument made by Mid-Atlantic in this matter. Although Mid-Atlantic maintains these cases are distinguishable because they occurred prior to HICPA's enactment, we are not persuaded. HICPA addresses consumer protection, not the permissible subjects of local taxation under the LTEA. Thus, its enactment does not limit the Court's interpretation of what subject may and may not be taxed under the LTEA. And, under the LTEA and the decisions of our courts, the taxation of a construction company's gross receipts for the privilege of its operating a business is separate and distinct from a tax on the construction services that company may provide. While a local taxing authority is precluded from taxing the latter under Subsection 301.1(f)(11), it is well-settled that the former is permissible. As the BPT assessed here is based on a business's gross receipts and is for the privilege of operating a business in Monroeville, Subsection 301.1(f)(11) is inapplicable here.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   <em>\n    C. Uniformity Clause and Equal Protection Clause.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   Mid-Atlantic next argues it met its burden of proving that Monroeville's taxing scheme is constitutionally infirm because that scheme, as applied to Mid-Atlantic, has been invalidated by HICPA and the LTEA. According to Mid-Atlantic, Monroeville's continued attempts to impose the invalidated BPT against it reflect an unreasonable classification of Mid-Atlantic\n   for the purposes of taxation. Tax Office responds that Mid-Atlantic has not specified how the alleged constitutional infirmities arise. Therefore, Tax Office argues, Mid-Atlantic has not met its heavy burden of showing that the BPT clearly, palpably, and plainly violates the Constitutions by creating an unreasonable classification for taxation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Where a taxpayer attacks \"the constitutionality of a tax, the burden is on the taxpayer to show that the tax clearly, palpably and plainly violates the Constitution by demonstrating that a classification for purposes of taxation is unreasonable.\"\n   <em>\n    MSG Assocs.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11482052\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/747/1275/\">\n    747 A.2d at 1278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Having not invalidated the assessment of the BPT against Mid-Atlantic under HICPA or the LTEA, this cannot be the basis of a successful constitutional claim. And, as Mid-Atlantic presents no other explanation or argument for how the BPT \"clearly, palpably and plainly violates the Constitution,\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11482052\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/747/1275/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , Mid-Atlantic has not met its heavy burden of demonstrating a constitutional violation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-68\">\n   <em>\n    D. Abatement\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-69\">\n   Mid-Atlantic finally asserts that, if it prevails on its arguments on the merits, the assessed penalties and interests would be obviated but, to the extent any penalties, interests, or costs remain, those amounts should be abated in full. Citing Section 508.B of the BPT Regulations, Mid-Atlantic maintains that Monroeville is required to abate any penalty or interest that can be attributed to \"erroneous advice furnished to the taxpayer in writing\" that is reasonably relied upon by the taxpayer. (Mid-Atlantic's Br. at 17.) Mid-Atlantic argues that the BPT Regulations and representations by the Tax Office that Mid-Atlantic had to register and obtain a license, contrary to HICPA, is such \"erroneous advice.\" (\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   ) Tax Office argues that, because Mid-Atlantic cannot prevail on the merits of its substantive arguments and the Revised Notices properly reflected the BPT Mid-Atlantic owed to Monroeville, Mid-Atlantic is not entitled to any abatement under Section 508.B of the BPT Regulations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-70\">\n   Because we have found that the BPT is not invalid under HICPA, the LTEA, or the United States or Pennsylvania Constitutions, Mid-Atlantic has not established an entitlement to an abatement on the basis that it has prevailed on the merits of its Tax Appeal. Moreover, we are not persuaded by Mid-Atlantic's argument that it received \"erroneous advice,\" upon which it reasonably relied that resulted in its underpaying the BPT. Section 508.B of the BPT Regulations provides\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-71\">\n   Monroeville shall abate any portion of any penalty or interest attributable to erroneous advice furnished to the taxpayer\n   <em>\n    in writing\n   </em>\n   by an officer, employee or agent of ... Monroeville, acting in their official capacity ... if:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-72\">\n   (1) The written advice was reasonably relied upon by the taxpayer and was in response to a specific written request of the taxpayer; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-73\">\n   (2) The portion of the additional tax, penalty and interest did not result from the failure of the taxpayer to provide adequate or accurate information.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   (R.R. at 156a (emphasis in original).) As discussed above, the\n   <strong>\n    general business\n   </strong>\n   registration and licensing process set forth in the BPT Ordinance and BPT Regulations\n   is not preempted by Section 12 of HICPA, and, there is nothing otherwise invalid about the assessment of the BPT. Therefore, it was not \"erroneous advice\" to require Mid-Atlantic to register and obtain a business license for the limited purpose of ascertaining tax liability in accordance with those provisions.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11482052\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/747/1275/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, abatement pursuant to Section 508.B of the Regulations is unavailable to Mid-Atlantic.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   <strong>\n    III.
