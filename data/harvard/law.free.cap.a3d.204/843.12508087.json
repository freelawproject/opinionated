To the extent respondent attempts to challenge the imposition of reciprocal discipline by relitigating the underlying findings and discipline imposed by the State of Virginia, such a challenge is improper in reciprocal disciplinary proceedings and respondent was provided notice of the charges and an opportunity to respond in the originating jurisdiction.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Zdravkovich\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9090555\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/831/964/#p969\">\n    831 A.2d 964\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 969 (D.C. 2003) (\"Put simply, reciprocal discipline proceedings are not a forum to reargue the foreign discipline.\").\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
