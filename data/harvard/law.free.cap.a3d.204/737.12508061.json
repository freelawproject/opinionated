(Doctor's Associates), Franchise World Headquarters, LLC (Franchise), and Independent Purchasing Cooperative, Inc. (Independent), engaged in unfair acts or practices and unfair methods of competition and deceptive acts or practices in their business dealings with the plaintiff concerning the design and development of a new product in violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq., and that in so doing they unjustly enriched themselves to the plaintiff's detriment. The plaintiff appeals from the summary judgment rendered in favor of the defendants on its complaint. We conclude that the trial court properly determined that the defendants were entitled to summary judgment on\n   each of the plaintiff's claims against them because they established that there was no genuine issue of material fact that the plaintiff had no right to prevail on any of those claims. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following facts are undisputed. In February, 2012, representatives from Doctor's Associates, the franchisor of the Subway restaurant chain in the United States, and Franchise, a corporation that provides administrative services to Doctor's Associates, approached the plaintiff about purchasing a standard flat metal heating plate that the plaintiff manufactured. The plate was to be considered for use in Subway restaurants to cook a new flatbread pizza product called the \"Flatizza.\" As a result of this meeting, the plaintiff provided one of its standard heating plates to Doctor's Associates for testing at Subway headquarters. Doctor's Associates also requested that the plaintiff sign a nondisclosure agreement to protect various details about its business practices, which the plaintiff signed on February 27, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   During the course of testing, representatives from Franchise notified the plaintiff that problems had arisen with using the plaintiff's standard plate to cook the Flatizzas. Thereafter, between April, 2012, and September, 2012, the plaintiff made numerous changes to its standard heating plate to address those problems, creating six different versions of the plate for the defendants to test. In its correspondence with defendants Doctor's Associates and Franchise concerning the changes that had been made to the plates, the plaintiff shared detailed technical information about its design. By the end of the testing period, Doctor's Associates had purchased a total of 133 heating plates from the plaintiff. Subway's primary oven manufacturer, TurboChef, ultimately approved the fifth version of the modified heating plate for use in its ovens in Subway restaurants. Subway then began to test market the Flatizza in several cities across the country to determine if it should offer the new product nationally. To facilitate such market testing, Doctor's Associates purchased 1,728 of the modified heating plates from the plaintiff, in eight separate orders from May, 2012 through February, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On June 4, 2012, a meeting was held between several the plaintiff representatives and representatives from Doctor's Associates and Franchise. At that meeting, the plaintiff was informed that if Subway's management decided to offer the Flatizza throughout the country, it would aim to distribute the modified heating plates to its franchisees in March, 2013, and thus the plaintiff would be expected to begin production of the new plates in October, 2012, after the plaintiff and Independent, Subway's purchasing arm, determined the pricing for the \"full production rollout.\" The plaintiff e-mailed representatives of Doctor's Associates and Franchise on June 7, 2012, to memorialize the June 4 meeting, but received no response. The defendants later decided to delay the March, 2013 rollout of the Flatizza.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   From March, 2013 through September, 2013, the defendants continued to update the plaintiff regarding the Flatizza project and to gather information from the plaintiff regarding its production capabilities for the new plates, the process by which it would seek national public health and safety approval for them, and its updates to its proposal for pricing the plates' production. On March 25, 2013, Ed Degnan, an equipment specialist for Franchise, requested a detailed production timeline and cost information from the plaintiff for an order of 16,000 plates, but he cautioned in an e-mail the following day: \"To be clear, this is exploratory only [and] not an\n   order. DO NOT ORDER ANY MATERIALS.\" In April, 2013, Franchise informed the plaintiff, in another e-mail, that it was working with four different vendors on the project. On May 31, 2013, Tricia Hetherington, the director of new product development for Franchise, e-mailed the plaintiff, stating that she would \"like to explore how we could be ready for a potential February, 2014 launch of Flatizza.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On July 10, 2013, the plaintiff e-mailed a representative from Independent to confirm the details of a recent phone call between itself and Independent concerning the need for a production timeline and pricing for 22,000 of the new plates, Subway's intent to roll out the Flatizza in its restaurants in February, 2014, and, to that end, its need to have all of the new plates delivered to a warehouse in Massachusetts for that purpose by December 20, 2013, and for the plaintiff to commit to filling the order no later than September 1, 2013. In response to that e-mail, the Independent representative stated that, although the plaintiff's summary of the phone call was accurate, \"[m]uch on our end is not firm, so please await further information ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At the same time, there was uncertainty as to whether Merrychef, the manufacturer of a different oven used in certain Subway restaurants as an alternative to the\n   TurboChef oven, would make its own heating plates for use in its ovens to cook Flatizzas rather than using plates manufactured by the plaintiff. Thereafter, on July 10, 2013, Independent asked the plaintiff to inform it of \"the impact of an additional 7000 Merrychef style plates should we add these to the order.\" On July 18, 2013, Franchise sent an e-mail to the plaintiff with the subject line \"Pizza Plate Bid Information.\" That e-mail read: \"Do you guys have any questions on this bid? I have notified my Merrychef rep that if you guys are approved to manufacture both plates then Merrychef will need to approve your plate in their oven. I would then send one of the [two] Merrychef plates you sent me to Merrychef for approvals.\" This was the first and only documented mention to the plaintiff by any defendant that the choice of manufacturer for the new heating plates, if they were ordered, would be made through a bidding process. Later that evening, Franchise e-mailed the plaintiff that it \"looks like you are ready to [go] if we give you the go ahead.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On August 1, 2013, Independent e-mailed the plaintiff to verify the production timeline information for a presentation by Franchise and Independent to \"the leadership,\" so that the leadership could \"understand the timing of the decision required.\" On August 16, 2013, the plaintiff e-mailed Independent to confirm a quote for the heating plates of $ 67.27 per unit. On September 13, 2013, Degnan informed the plaintiff that there were no new updates on the Flatizza project and that he would not expect any decisions that year. The final e-mail exchange between Franchise and the plaintiff occurred on September 23, 2013, when the plaintiff asked Franchise to \"go over a few things\" over the telephone and Franchise responded that it was not sure what the plaintiff wanted to discuss, but it still needed the information about production capabilities and other matters it had requested from the plaintiff earlier that day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On October 10, 2013, Sam Grano de Oro, the director of operations for the plaintiff, received a telephone call from Degnan. Degnan first asked whether the plaintiff had purchased the materials needed to fulfill an order from the defendants for the full production rollout. Grano de Oro responded that the plaintiff had not purchased any materials, but that all of the necessary preparations to do so had been made with its materials suppliers. Degnan\n   then informed Grano de Oro that the defendants had \"decided to go with another provider,\" without offering any explanation for its decision. Grano de Oro responded by requesting an opportunity to address any concerns that the defendants might have had with their bid, but that request was not honored. All he could do at that time was to inform Degnan that the new heating plate and its design belonged to the plaintiff. Sometime in late August or early September, 2013, the plaintiff filed an application for a design patent for the modified heating plate. That application was ultimately granted approximately two years later, on September 15, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   Early in 2014, the plaintiff became aware that Subway had proceeded with the nationwide rollout of the Flatizza. In April, 2014, representatives from the plaintiff began to investigate how that had been done and discovered that a metal heating plate similar to the one the plaintiff had designed for the defendants was being used in Subway restaurants in Florida and Connecticut. The plaintiff then hired a mechanical engineer and a material science engineer to compare the new heating plate it had designed to the plate being used in Subway restaurants. The engineers opined that the two plates were nearly identical and that the defendants' plate appeared to be a refinement of the plaintiff's plate. Through its continued investigation, the plaintiff discovered that an executive at VTM Concepts, the supplier of the nearly identical heating plate being used in Subway\n   restaurants, is married to the president of Doctor's Associates and Franchise, who had been copied on several of the e-mails between the plaintiff and Franchise regarding the progress of the heating plate project.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The plaintiff subsequently filed this action. In its five-count amended complaint, the plaintiff alleged that the defendants were jointly and severally liable on the following theories of liability: (1) in the first count, for unfair acts or practices and unfair methods of competition in violation of CUTPA; (2) in the second count, for punitive damages under CUTPA, based upon the unfair acts or practices and unfair methods of competition alleged in the first count; (3) in the third count, for deceptive acts or practices in violation of CUTPA; (4) in the fourth count, for punitive damages under CUTPA based upon the deceptive acts or practices alleged in the third count; and (5) in the fifth count, unjust enrichment based upon the conduct alleged in the first four counts. The complaint alleged, more specifically, that over the course of one and one half years, the defendants had expressly or impliedly represented to the plaintiff, and thereby caused it to believe, that it would receive an order for over 25,000 new heating plates if Subway decided to launch the Flatizza nationwide. In reliance on these representations, the plaintiff had designed a custom heating plate for the defendants, supplied samples of the new plate to Subway for test marketing purposes, and turned over to the defendants the design and technical information needed to manufacture the plates. Each of the defendants answered the complaint by denying all allegations of wrongdoing against it and pleading several special defenses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   On January 13, 2017, the defendants filed parallel motions for summary judgment. In its memorandum of decision granting the motions for summary judgment as to all defendants on all counts, the trial court concluded that the undisputed facts showed that there was\n   nothing unfair or deceptive about the defendants' dealings with the plaintiff with respect to the new heating plates, noting that \"not every missed business opportunity violates CUTPA,\" and that the plaintiff could have avoided any injury to itself resulting from\n   others' use of its product design by taking reasonable steps to protect itself. The court further concluded that the defendants had not been unjustly enriched by the plaintiff's efforts to design the new heating plate because the plaintiff had not been deceived or misled to provide its design to the defendants without paying for it or without protecting itself by negotiating a confidentiality agreement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   On appeal, the plaintiff claims that (1) the trial court improperly concluded that no genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether the defendants' conduct constituted an unfair act or practice in violation of CUTPA, (2) the court improperly concluded that there was no genuine issue of material fact as to whether the defendants' conduct constituted a deceptive act or practice in violation of CUTPA, and (3) the court erred in concluding that no genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether the defendants were unjustly enriched to the plaintiff's detriment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   \"Our review of the trial court's decision to grant a motion for summary judgment is plenary.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Brusby\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Metropolitan District\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=160%20Conn.%20App.%20638\">\n    160 Conn.

Specifically, the plaintiff argues that the defendants induced the plaintiff to believe that it would receive a large order for new plates of the type it had designed and developed for the defendants if the Flatizza was introduced in Subway restaurants nationwide, but instead gave their design to a manufacturer run by the spouse of a high ranking executive of Doctor's Associates and Franchise, from which they purchased the new plates at a slightly lower price than that quoted to them by the plaintiff. Although the conduct complained of by the plaintiff might very well constitute a CUTPA violation if the circumstances were as alleged, that claim is factually unsupported in this case.

There is no factual basis for the plaintiff's claim that it was unfairly induced to act to its own detriment in any way. To the contrary, the evidentiary materials submitted to the trial court show that the plaintiff freely sold the defendants a product and the design specifications therefor that were unprotected, and thus fully available to the defendants to use, refine or copy as they saw fit. Therefore, we agree with the court's determination that there is no genuine issue of material fact that the defendants' conduct did not amount to an unfair act or practice in violation of CUTPA, and thus that the defendants were entitled to judgment on the plaintiff's first two claims as a matter of law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   General Statutes \u00a7 42-110b (a) provides: \"No person shall engage in unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce.\" \"It is well settled that in determining whether a practice violates CUTPA [our Supreme Court has] adopted the criteria set out in the cigarette rule by the [F]ederal [T]rade [C]ommission for determining when a practice is unfair: (1) [W]hether the practice, without necessarily having been previously considered unlawful, offends public policy as it has been established by statutes, the common law, or otherwise-in other words, it is within at least the penumbra of some common law, statutory, or other established concept of unfairness; (2) whether it is immoral, unethical, oppressive, or unscrupulous; (3) whether it causes substantial injury to consumers, [competitors or other businesspersons].... All three\n   criteria do not need to be satisfied to support a finding of unfairness. A practice may be unfair because of the degree to which it meets one of the criteria or because to a lesser extent it meets all three.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Ulbrich\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Groth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=310%20Conn.%20375\">\n    310 Conn. 375\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 409,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=78%20A.3d%2076\">\n    78 A.3d 76\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The first prong of the cigarette rule requires us to consider whether the alleged unfair practice offends public policy to the extent that it constitutes a breach of an established concept of unfairness. The plaintiff argues that such a breach can be found in (1) the defendants' inducement of the plaintiff to believe that it would receive a contract for a large order of the new plates, which allowed the defendants to obtain technical information for the plate's product design, (2) giving the plaintiff's design for the new plate to a competitor that had personal ties to the defendants, and (3) then awarding the manufacturing contract for the new plates to that competitor instead of to the plaintiff. The plaintiff does not explicitly state which public policies support its claims, arguing general unfairness instead. It appears that the public policy basis for the plaintiff's first argument is equitable estoppel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   \"Strong public policies have long formed the basis of the doctrine of equitable estoppel. The office of an equitable estoppel is to show what equity and good conscience require, under the particular circumstances of the case, irrespective of what might otherwise be the legal rights of the parties.... No one is ever estopped from asserting what would otherwise be his right, unless to allow its assertion would enable him to do a wrong.... There\n   are two essential elements to an estoppel: the party [against whom it is asserted] must do or say something which is intended or calculated to induce another to believe in the existence of certain\n   facts and to act upon that belief; and the other party, influenced thereby, must actually change his position or do something to his injury which he otherwise would not have done. Estoppel rests on the misleading conduct of one party to the prejudice of the other. In the absence of prejudice, estoppel does not exist.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Fischer\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Zollino\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12174454\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/303/661/#p668\">\n    303 Conn. 661\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 668,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20A.3d%20270\">\n    35 A.3d 270\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2012).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   We agree with the trial court that the defendants' prolonged negotiations with the plaintiff do not offend public policy in such a way as to violate an established concept of unfairness within the meaning of the first prong of the cigarette rule. In rejecting the plaintiff's CUTPA claim, the trial court concluded that there was no genuine issue of material fact that the defendants' communications with the plaintiff about the design or development of the new plate was misleading or intended to induce the plaintiff to believe that it would receive the contract. Although the defendants spent one and one half years discussing the plaintiff's potential receipt of a contract for a large order of the new plates, the plaintiff concedes that there never was such a contract and that throughout its dealings with the defendants it fully understood that Subway might decide to forego a national rollout of the Flatizza, in which case no order for the new plates it designed and developed would ever be placed with anyone. Even if the defendants had explicitly stated that they intended to purchase plates from the plaintiff in the event of a nationwide rollout of the Flatizza, it is undisputed that any order was conditioned on the rollout's occurrence. Moreover, the defendants cautioned the plaintiff on more than one occasion that it should not take any actions in reliance on their exploratory conversations. As noted by the trial court, the plaintiff hoped that it would be chosen to manufacture a large order of plates for the defendants and, from the e-mails discussing\n   production timelines, shipping details, and pricing, it seemed for some time that that would happen; however, the defendants never made any statements that would lead the plaintiff reasonably to believe that a future contract was guaranteed. Without any misleading statements or conduct on the part of the defendants, the public policy underlying equitable estoppel was not violated by their conduct in violation of the first prong of the cigarette rule.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The plaintiff further contends that the defendants violated CUTPA by giving the plaintiff's design to a competitor. Here again, the plaintiff does not point this court to any particular public policy which it claims to have been violated by such conduct, thus establishing its unfairness under the first prong of the cigarette rule. In support of its argument, however, the plaintiff states that during its dealings with the defendants it was seeking a patent for the modified heating plate and had informed the defendants of these efforts. Therefore, we consider whether the defendants' actions violated any established public policy related to the plaintiff's efforts to patent the new heating plate.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   As an initial matter, it is undisputed that there was no patent or confidentiality agreement in effect for the plaintiff's design at the time of its dealings with the defendants. The most protection the product had was the pending patent application that was not submitted until August or September, 2013. It is disputed between the parties as to whether the plaintiff ever informed the defendants that it had filed a\n   patent application for the heating plate. The defendants deny being told by the plaintiff that it had filed such an application. The plaintiff claims that in September, 2012, representatives from the plaintiff had met with representatives from Doctor's Associates and Franchise at Subway headquarters to give them a status report on the heating plate project and during that meeting it had noted that it was\n   in the process of applying for a design patent for the new plate. The plaintiff also etched the words \"Patent Pending\" on at least forty of the heating plates that it sold to the defendants during the testing process. However, these disputed facts are not material because, even if we assume that the plaintiff informed the defendants of its pending patent application in September, 2012, and that the defendants, knowing this information, took the plaintiff's plate design to a competitor, these acts would not have violated any established public policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \"To willfully infringe a patent, the patent must exist and one must have knowledge of it.... Filing an application is no guarantee any patent will issue and a very substantial percentage of applications never result in patents.\" (Emphasis omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State Industries, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    A.O.

Here, Doctor's Associates made several arm's length purchases of these unprotected products from the plaintiff over the course of a year and a half. The defendants were free to do as they wished with the plaintiff's products that they purchased in that time frame, including showing those products, which they then owned without restriction, to other companies and asking those companies to refine the products' design. The public policy underlying our patent law supports such imitation and refinement. Thus, it cannot be said that the defendants' conduct in so doing violated any established concept of unfairness.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Finally, the plaintiff argues that the defendants' committed an unfair act or practice by causing it to engage in a \"sham 'bidding' process,\" in the course of which it was forced to bid against only one competitor with personal ties to the defendant companies that had been given the plaintiff's design with which to prepare and submit its competing bid. Nothing about the fact that the defendants gave the contract to a manufacturer run by the spouse of the president of Doctor's Associates and\n   Franchise offends public policy. It is well established that a trader or manufacturer carrying on an entirely private business is free to determine with whom it will deal.

There are no facts to suggest that the cost savings for the defendants in purchasing from VTM Concepts in any way passed through to the consumer so as to establish a countervailing benefit that outweighs the injury. We agree with the trial court, however, that this injury was one that the plaintiff reasonably could have avoided by the simple expedient of obtaining a confidentiality agreement or some other stopgap measure to protect its product design until the patent it had applied for was issued. This is especially true considering that Doctor's\n   Associates had the plaintiff sign a nondisclosure agreement at the outset of their business relationship, at which point the plaintiff could have requested such an agreement to protect their design in return. Instead, by proceeding without such protection for its work product, the plaintiff freely allowed the defendants to take its design to a competitor that might in turn refine it or simply manufacture it, with or without refinements, more cheaply.

Because there is no evidence that the defendants failed to pay the plaintiff for any benefit they received, we conclude that the court did not err in rendering summary judgment for the defendants on the plaintiff's unjust enrichment claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
