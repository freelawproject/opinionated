On May 23, 2017, the respondent filed a motion to dismiss the ex post facto claim, arguing that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over any and all claims related to parole eligibility and risk reduction earned credit. The court conducted a hearing on June 5, 2017, following which it granted the motion to dismiss. On September 14, 2017, following a hearing, the habeas court denied the remainder of the habeas petition. It subsequently granted the petitioner's petition for certification to appeal, and this appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The sole issue raised on appeal is whether the habeas court improperly concluded that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the petitioner's ex post facto claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On December 4, 2018, our Supreme Court published its opinion in\n   <em>\n    Breton\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12503377\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/196/789/\">\n    330 Conn. at 462\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12503377\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/196/789/\">\n    196 A.3d 789\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

In reversing the judgment of the habeas court dismissing the habeas petition and remanding the case back to that court with direction to render judgment for the petitioner, our Supreme Court indicated as follows: \"It is true, of course, that only a relatively small percentage of inmates-namely, those inmates who, like the petitioner, are incarcerated for committing a violent crime between 2011 and 2013-will be affected by our holding today. Moreover, the only relief to which those inmates are entitled is parole consideration prior to completion of 85 percent of their sentence; whether to grant parole at that time is a decision that remains solely within the broad discretion of the [Board of Pardons and Paroles]. But the ex post facto clause safeguards the right of those inmates to such consideration regardless of whether they are granted parole at that initial hearing.\" (Emphasis omitted.)\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12503377\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/196/789/\">\n    Id., at 485-86\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12503377\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/196/789/\">\n    196 A.3d 789\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"Although our rules of practice do not contain an express provision authorizing a summary disposition of an appeal\n   on the merits, this court has the authority to suspend the rules [i]n the interest of expediting decision, or for other good cause shown ....

Thus, the 2013 amendment to \u00a7 54-125a(b)(2), as applied to him, violates the ex post facto clause. The petitioner is entitled to parole consideration prior to completion of 85 percent of his definite sentence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The motion is granted, the judgment of the habeas court is reversed with respect to the dismissal of the petitioner's ex post facto claim, and the case is remanded with direction to grant that portion of the petition.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    The constitution of the United States, article one, \u00a7 10, provides in relevant part: \"No State shall ... pass any ... ex post facto Law ....\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-21\">\n    On October 11, 2018, this court, with the consent of the parties, granted a stay of the briefing in this case until sixty days after a decision by our Supreme Court in\n    <em>\n     Breton\n    </em>\n    and a companion case,\n    <em>\n     Garner\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Commissioner of Correction\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12503181\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/196/1138/\">\n     330 Conn. 486\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12503181\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/196/1138/\">\n     196 A.3d 1138\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2018), which had been argued together and concerned the same ex post facto claim raised in the present appeal.
