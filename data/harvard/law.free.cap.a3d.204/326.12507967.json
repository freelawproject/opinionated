Michael Eakin (\"Eakin\") and possible ex parte communication between Eakin and members of the Office of the Cumberland County District Attorney (the \"DA\"). We are also asked to decide whether the DA should be disqualified from participating in this matter based on the connection between the DA and Eakin that was exposed through Eakin's disciplinary proceedings. For the reasons that follow, we would conclude that Robinson satisfied the newly discovered fact exception to the PCRA's one-year time requirement and filed his petition within sixty days of the date his claim could have first been brought. We further would conclude that the particular facts and circumstances of this case require the disqualification of the DA from further proceedings. We would hold that, on remand, the President Judge of the Cumberland County Court of Common Pleas must\n   refer the matter to the Office of the Attorney General (\"OAG\") who, in the absence of a conflict, would represent the Commonwealth in this matter. The PCRA court would also be ordered to give renewed consideration to Robinson's requests to amend his PCRA petition, for discovery and for an evidentiary hearing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The backdrop of this case is an email scandal that first came to light in 2014 following an investigation conducted by former Attorney General Kathleen Kane into her predecessor's handling of an unrelated matter. This investigation uncovered emails sent from and received by members of her office on Commonwealth owned computers that contained racist, sexist, misogynistic, homophobic, and religiously and ethnically insensitive content. Their piecemeal release revealed individuals from all three branches of the Commonwealth's government as having sent and/or received these emails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Of relevance to the case at bar, in October 2014, news articles reported that former Pennsylvania Supreme Court Justice Seamus McCaffery sent and received numerous of these offensive emails. Shortly thereafter, Eakin was also implicated in the scandal. As discussed herein, the story of Eakin's involvement broke on or about October 8, 2014, and continued to evolve and develop through his suspension from judicial and administrative responsibilities on December 22, 2015, resignation on March 15, 2016, and decision by the Court of Judicial Discipline (\"CJD\") on March 24, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   With this background in mind, we turn to the case before us. On March 13, 1997, a jury convicted Robinson of the attempted murder of Tara Hodge, Robinson's on-again/off-again paramour, and the first-degree murder of Rashawn Bass, Hodge's boyfriend.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The evidence at trial revealed that on June 29, 1996, sometime after receiving a letter from Hodge ending their relationship, Robinson drove from his home outside of Washington, D.C. to her apartment in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. Upon learning that she was not alone, Robinson and Hodge began to argue. Robinson requested that Hodge tell her guest to leave. When she refused, Robinson pulled a gun from his waistband and shot Hodge in the head. She lost consciousness but survived. Robinson then went into the bathroom where Bass was showering and shot him seven times, killing him almost instantly. Robinson then fled the scene.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The elected DA at that time, Merle L. Ebert, Jr. (\"Ebert\"), tried the case on behalf of the Commonwealth. The theme of the prosecution was that Robinson was a gun-toting criminal from the \"big city\" who came to Cumberland County with the intent to kill because he had been \"disrespected\" by Hodge.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   N.T.,\n   3/12/1997, at 6; N.T., 3/13/1997, at 271, 273, 277. In his defense, Robinson did not deny that he shot both Hodge and Bass, but contended that he lacked the intent to kill or to attempt to kill.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   N.T., 3/13/1997, at 265-67; N.T., 3/14/1997, at 366-67.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The jury sentenced Robinson to death the following day.

Robinson raised twelve issues for the Court's review. In a divided four-to-three opinion, this Court affirmed.

The majority opinion addressed the race-related argument by finding that the Commonwealth did nothing improper: \"Here, the prosecutor's remarks were not a deliberate attempt to destroy the objectivity of the jury, but merely summarized the evidence presented at trial with oratorical flair permitted during argument.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8955379,687694\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/877/433/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8955379,687694\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/877/433/\">\n    at 442\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Because the DA did not mention Robinson's race, the majority concluded that the claim that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object was without merit. Then-Justice (now-Chief Justice) Saylor authored a comprehensive dissenting opinion wherein he stated his view that the prosecutor's statements in this latter regard were improper.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8955379,687694\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/877/433/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8955379,687694\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/877/433/\">\n    at 451\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Saylor, J., dissenting).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   In 2005, Ebert was elected to serve as a judge in the Cumberland County Court of Common Pleas and was succeeded as DA by Attorney David J.

Smith (\"Smith\") and Assistant DA Charles J. Volkert, Jr. (now Chief Deputy DA) began representing the Commonwealth in this matter. The district court denied relief on September 30, 2011. The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed the denial and the United States Supreme Court denied a petition for certiorari on October 5, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   With his habeas petition pending before the Third Circuit, Robinson filed a second PCRA petition pro se in the Cumberland County Court of Common Pleas on September 30, 2013. The court appointed counsel on October 3, 2013, who filed an amended petition on Robinson's behalf. The PCRA court dismissed the petition as untimely, and this Court affirmed on June 20, 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v.

He filed the motion upon learning that on December 18, 2015, all but one of the sitting judges\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   signed a letter that was sent to the CJD in support of Eakin after the Judicial Conduct Board (\"JCB\") filed formal charges against him.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Honorable Albert H. Masland, who was sitting as the PCRA court judge, granted the order, recusing himself \"to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest and allow this matter to proceed on its merits,\" and vacated the December 8 and January 5 orders dismissing Robinson's petition. PCRA Court Order, 1/8/2016. Judge Masland referred Robinson's request for the whole court's recusal to the Honorable Edward E. Guido, President Judge of Cumberland County. Judge Guido entered an order the same day stating \"that all Common Pleas Judges of the 21\n   <sup>\n    st\n   </sup>\n   Judicial District are recused from hearing this matter in order to avoid the appearance of a conflict of\n   interest or impropriety.\" Order of President Judge Guido, 1/8/2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In the meantime, on January 7, 2016, Robinson appealed the dismissal of his PCRA petition to this Court. On January 19, 2016, he informed the Court of the intervening change in circumstances and filed a motion to remand the case, which we granted.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Order, 3/18/2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   On April 18, 2016, Robinson filed a motion in the common pleas court seeking the disqualification of the DA's office from participating further in the proceedings. The motion stated that Robinson had recently become aware that Freed had received at least one of the offensive emails in his work email account. Petitioner's Motion to Disqualify the DA's Office, 4/16/2016, \u00b6 5;\n   <em>\n    see also id.\n   </em>\n   at Exhibit A. Further, Robinson had learned that both Freed and Smith sent letters in support of Eakin to the JCB. Petitioner's Motion to Disqualify the DA's Office, 4/16/2016, at Exhibits B and C. Robinson contended that these circumstances required the DA's disqualification because Freed's receipt of the email made him a witness to the events giving rise to Robinson's petition, and thus the DA's continued participation \"runs afoul of the Advocate-Witness Rule.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 14-15 (citing Pa.R.P.C. 3.7 ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   Further, Robinson asserted that Freed had a personal interest in the outcome of the petition, giving rise of an actual conflict of interest that precluded his representation of the Commonwealth in this matter.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 16. According to Robinson, a judicial finding in his favor \"would potentially affect the reputations of Ebert and Freed\" because of their receipt of blast emails, which demonstrates \"a personal stake in the outcome of the case and an actual conflict of interest that impairs the [DA's] independent judgment as a prosecutor.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 17-18 (citing\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v.

Therein, the Commonwealth advocated for the PCRA court to deny Robinson's motion because (1) the PCRA court lacked jurisdiction of the underlying PCRA petition pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Lark\n   </em>\n   ; (2) the issues raised in the underlying PCRA petition were frivolous and should be dismissed out of hand; and (3) Robinson failed to demonstrate that the DA is burdened by bias or conflict. Judge Guido appointed Senior Judge Douglas W. Herman of Franklin County to specially preside and scheduled argument on the petition and the motion for June 17, 2016.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   On June 15, 2016, Robinson filed a motion in which he requested discovery, permission to supplement and amend his PCRA petition, and an evidentiary hearing on his petition. Therein, Robinson asserted that the complaint filed by the JCB against Eakin revealed numerous additional racially insensitive and otherwise offensive emails (including several making light of domestic violence) that Eakin had sent and/or received, and that even more were entered as exhibits in the proceedings before the CJD. Robinson also identified emails that revealed an association between Eakin and members of the DA's office and between Eakin and Judges Bayley and Masland, respectively, as well as the aforementioned letters sent by Freed and Smith in support of Eakin, all of which were entered at the former Justice's disciplinary proceeding. Robinson contended that he should be entitled to amend his petition to include this information and additional allegations of bias, and claimed his entitlement to an evidentiary hearing on his petition.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Pa.R.Crim.P. 905(a) (\"The judge may grant leave to amend or withdraw a petition for post-conviction collateral relief at any time. Amendment shall be freely allowed to achieve substantial justice.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Further, he stated that his case presented \"exceptional circumstances\" to warrant the grant of discovery. Pa.R.Crim.P. 902(E)(1). The information disclosed to date, Robinson averred, included the disclosure of \"thousands of emails\" exchanged between prosecutors, defense attorneys and members of the judiciary, exhibiting \"racial, ethnic, gender, class and religious bias,\" which \"creates a grave question about the actual fairness, and appearance of fairness, of the judicial processes in which those parties were involved.\" Motion, 6/15/2016, \u00b6 34. He noted, however, that until now, \"investigation has been limited to those emails that remain on the servers of Pennsylvania's Attorney General,\" and asserts that discovery is required to uncover \"the full scope and impact of improper biases on the resolution of [Robinson]'s case.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6222790,1148238\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/l-ed-2d/95/740/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   He thus requested discovery of the following:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   \u2022 Any and all electronic messages (including emails and text messages) and attachments exchanged between employees working in the Cumberland County District Attorney's Office or other law enforcement departments and judges of the Cumberland County Court of Common Pleas, Pennsylvania Superior Court and justices on the Pennsylvania Supreme Court from June 1996 to March 15, 2016 that relate to Petitioner or his case, or which may reasonably be deemed offensive because of content that relates to race, gender, ethnicity, violence toward women, xenophobia, homophobia, sexism, religious intolerance, class or immigration or stereotypes relating thereto[;]\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-34\">\n   \u2022 Any and all communications, including but not limited to notes, letters, emails, text messages, attachments and facsimiles exchanged between Cumberland County District Attorney Employees, including District Attorney Freed, and Justice Eakin and/or his attorneys, including, but not limited to Attorneys Williams C.

Both parties complied. In the interim, this Court issued its decision in\n   <em>\n    Robinson III\n   </em>\n   affirming the dismissal of Robinson's second PCRA petition as untimely.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In an opinion and order filed on November 28, 2016, the PCRA court denied Robinson's motion to disqualify the DA from the case. The PCRA court stated that removal of a prosecutor from a case is warranted only where there is \"an actual conflict of interest affecting the prosecutor,\" and that mere allegations and animosity are insufficient. PCRA Court Opinion and Order, 11/28/2016, at 3 (Superior Court case citations omitted). Addressing Robinson's claims of bias and possible ex parte communication, the PCRA court found that Robinson made only a \"generalized assertion of bias and impropriety\" without \"any examples of inappropriate ex parte communication between Freed and Justice Eakin.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The PCRA court further found that the Advocate-Witness Rule was inapplicable because \"Freed's passive receipt of an email that does not reference or implicate [Robinson] and his penning of a letter of support does not make him a necessary witness to the events referenced in the PCRA petition.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. Once again, the court found that Robinson's failure to plead specific allegations related to the DA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   militated against disqualifying the DA from the case. PCRA Court Opinion and Order, 11/28/2016, at 6.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   Lastly, the PCRA court found that Robinson's claim that the DA had a personal reputational interest in the outcome of the case lacked support. The court stated that Robinson failed to provide evidence that the outcome of his PCRA petition placed Freed's reputation in jeopardy or that he had any interest in preserving Ebert's reputation.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7. As Robinson did not establish that the DA had an actual conflict of interest, the PCRA court concluded that the DA's disqualification was unwarranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Thereafter, the Commonwealth filed a motion to dismiss Robinson's PCRA petition and discovery request without a hearing. This motion was again based on the Commonwealth's assessment of the merits of the case. In support, the Commonwealth pointed to two \"email-controversy-based PCRA filings\" that common pleas courts had recently dismissed without evidentiary hearings. Commonwealth's Request to Dismiss, 12/8/2016, at 2 (citing\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v. Housman\n   </em>\n   , CP-21-CR-0246-2001, and\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v. Shannon\n   </em>\n   , CP-22-CR-2306-2005) ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Robinson responded, seeking an extension of time to file an answer to the Commonwealth's motion to dismiss and renewing his request for discovery. Robinson also made an another request for permission to amend his PCRA petition, this time based on additional information he received following the completion of the investigation of and report compiled regarding the email scandal by Special Deputy Attorney General Douglas F. Gansler (the \"Gansler Report\"). On December 28, 2016, the PCRA court granted Robinson's requested time extension. On January 27, 2017, the PCRA court supplemented its order by authorizing \"general discovery as requested in [Robinson's] motion of June 15, 2016.\" Supplemental Order of the PCRA Court, 1/27/2017.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   In response, the Commonwealth filed a new motion to dismiss and a request for the PCRA court to vacate and reconsider its grant of discovery, or, in the alternative, to allow the Commonwealth to appeal the grant of discovery. Of relevance to this appeal, for the first time, the Commonwealth asserted in this motion that the PCRA court lacked jurisdiction of the matter on timeliness grounds. The Commonwealth averred that its review of the Gansler Report revealed newspaper articles detailing Eakin's receipt of at least one racially insensitive email dating back to October 2014, including one published on philly.com, the same online media source that published the October 8, 2015 article relied on by Robinson in his PCRA petition. Commonwealth's Motion to Dismiss, 2/7/2017, \u00b6 3 (citing Jeremy Roebuck,\n   <em>\n    Pa. Supreme Court meltdown over e-mails worsens\n   </em>\n   , philly.com, Oct. 18, 2014; Kate Giammarise and Bill Toland,\n   <em>\n    Pennsylvania Justice Eakin dragged into lewd email scandal; accuses McCaffery of blackmail\n   </em>\n   , Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Oct. 18, 2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   In addition to the news articles, the Commonwealth appended a press release authored on October 17, 2014 by Eakin, wherein he acknowledged that he received (but denied that he viewed) emails sent to his personal email address that contained inappropriate content.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at Exhibit H. Therein, he informed the media that he self-reported this to the JCB for its investigation as to whether his \"unsolicited\" receipt of these emails violated the canons of judicial conduct.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Based on all of this information available in October 2014, the Commonwealth contended that Robinson's November 30, 2015 petition was not filed within sixty days of the date his claimed due process violation\n   could have been presented.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 2;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9545(b)(2). Finding that the Commonwealth \"raised a substantial question of fact and law\" as to the PCRA court's jurisdiction, the PCRA court ordered Robinson to file an answer to the motion. It further vacated its January 27 order granting discovery, pending the resolution of the jurisdictional question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   Robinson filed a response to the Commonwealth's motion, asserting, in relevant part, that the 2014 articles did not provide a basis for his claim that Eakin's bias violated his due process rights. Robinson included a generalized timeline of the events leading up to the discovery of Eakin's involvement in the email scandal, averring that it was not until the 2015 articles (and the information that came to light thereafter), which detailed a pattern of sending and receiving offensive emails and connected both Eakin and prosecutors involved in Robinson's case, that his claim could have been made. Thus, by filing his petition on November 30, 2015, Robinson asserted that he met the sixty-day deadline.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The PCRA court held argument on the Commonwealth's motion to dismiss on April 7, 2017. Thereafter, on May 4, 2017, it entered an opinion and order pursuant to Rule of Criminal Procedure 909(B)(2), stating its intent to dismiss Robinson's PCRA petition without a hearing. The PCRA court recognized that Robinson's claims raised in the instant petition \"were predicated upon [his] contention that the bias of Justice Eakin was demonstrated both through the sending and receiving of objectionable emails and the potential for inappropriate ex parte communication to have occurred through those emails.\" PCRA Court Opinion and Order, 5/4/2017, at 6. The court concluded, however, that the petition was not timely filed. In particular, the court found that \"Justice Eakin was publicly tied to the email scandal on October 18, 2014, and potentially earlier.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The court stated that \"the public availability of facts,\" and not \"the publication of a specific report on or compilation of those facts,\" triggers the running of the sixty-day clock for filing a facially untimely PCRA petition.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 6-7;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v.

Further, because counsel represented Robinson at the time, the PCRA court concluded that Robinson was presumed to have been aware of the October 2014 publications, and therefore, that Robinson's November 30, 2015 PCRA petition was not filed within sixty days of the date the claim could have been raised.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 7;\n   <em>\n    cf.\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v.

Disc. 2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   To the extent we could conclude that the uninvited receipt of three offensive emails put Robinson on notice in 2014 that Eakin may have been biased in his decision making, such a notion was put to rest by the various investigations conducted of the then-available emails Eakin sent and received. On October 15, 2014, a news outlet reported that former Chief Justice Castille stated that he reviewed 4000 emails that had been exchanged between the sitting Justices of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court and the OAG and \"exonerate[d]\" all Justices other than McCaffery of sending or receiving offensive emails. Bumsted,\n   <em>\n    Castille: No Justices Except McCaffery Involved in Porn Scandal\n   </em>\n   , Pittsburgh Tribune-Review.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   On December 17, 2014, the JCB concluded its investigation of claims that Eakin received \"racy\" emails at his personal \"John Smith\" email account.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   JCB Letter, 12/17/2014, at 2. The JCB conducted three interviews with Eakin and reviewed subpoenaed emails ranging from 2009-2012 from the OAG. The JCB determined that Eakin \"did not receive any material that was illegal, such as obscenity, or any material that contained 'racist' images,\" and that although Eakin received some emails with \"pornographic\" content to his \"John Smith\" account, he did not send any such emails.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3. The JCB found no improper communications in the emails submitted by the OAG to or from his Court-issued email address.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   The JCB concluded that Eakin's \"receipt of a handful of mildly pornographic emails from a private attorney and from members of [his] personal circle of friends to [his] personal email address did not constitute a violation of the Constitution or the Code of Judicial Conduct,\" and dismissed the pending complaints.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   This conclusion was echoed in the December 19, 2014 report completed by Attorney Robert L. Byer, who was specially engaged by this Court to review email messages recovered by the OAG involving Justices of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court (hereinafter referred to as the \"Byer Report\"). Of relevance to the matter at bar, he concluded:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-75\">\n   1. Other than the previously disclosed email messages from [McCaffery] transmitting pornographic materials, there were\n   <strong>\n    no email messages of an improper nature sent by any Justice of the Supreme Court\n   </strong>\n   to any representative of OAG\n   <strong>\n    or from any representative of OAG to any Justice of the Supreme Court\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-76\">\n   * * *\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-77\">\n   3. There was no reason for any Justice of the Supreme Court to be recused from any case as the result of any email communication or any relationship evidenced by email communication.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   Byer Report at 1 (emphasis added). Attorney Byer detailed his review of emails provided to him from the OAG's server pertaining to each Justice. Regarding Eakin, he reviewed a total of 2234 emails that members of the OAG either sent to or received from Eakin, all of which Attorney Byer found to be \"unremarkable.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   In conducting his review, Attorney Byer observed \"a critical distinction between email messages sent from an account and email messages sent to an account,\" as a person does not have \"control over what others send.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 5. He noted that \"there was one message received by Eakin\n   that contained offensive sexual content,\" but stated that the \"message was not from someone at OAG or associated with the judicial system, and Justice Eakin did not reply to or forward that message.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   Attorney Byer found no messages discussing any cases or legal issues.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 4.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Based on the information publicly available in 2014, we conclude that Robinson did not have a basis to allege that Eakin was biased in order to bring his due process claim at that time. As is evident from the investigations undertaken by this Court and the JCB, both of which requested all email communications (sent and received) between Eakin and members of the OAG, no amount of diligence could have uncovered the facts upon which Robinson's claim is predicated, i.e., that Eakin sent and received offensive emails.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.,\n   </em>\n   JCB Complaint, 12/8/2015, \u00b6 50 (\"Despite the Board's prior subpoenas, OAG did not inform the Board of its possession of any emails from Justice Eakin's 'John Smith' email address beyond the 48 Outlook files received by the Board on November 5, 2014, and did not provide them to the Board until September 28, 2015.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   That all changed, however, in 2015, when news outlets revealed additional offensive emails that Eakin had not only received from various sources, but also had sent, in contradiction to his 2014 claim that he had never opened or welcomed these emails. On October 8, 2015, a report disclosed the existence of additional emails, which contained descriptions of racist, sexist, homophobic and misogynistic content, and which indicated that Eakin both received and sent these emails. These emails, sent to the media by the OAG, were also sent directly to the JCB by the OAG on discs on September 28, 2015 (but were not made public at that time) and October 15, 2015, and the JCB's complaint confirmed that the emails had not previously been disclosed.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 67 (\"Based on their review, Board staff concluded that the September 28, 2015 disc [sent by the OAG] contained emails that had not been seen by any Board staff member during the 2014 investigation of Justice Eakin.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   We considered analogous circumstances when deciding\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v. Chmiel\n   </em>\n   . In that case, we held that the FBI's public acknowledgement (in the form of a press release that was published in several newspapers) that testimony regarding microscopic hair analysis was \"flawed\" in the great majority of cases constituted a \"new fact\" for PCRA purposes.\n   <em>\n    Chmiel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12348894\" index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/173/617/\">\n    173 A.3d at 626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In so holding, we rejected the contention that earlier reports and articles that indicated that the FBI was questioning the validity of its methodology, or scientific studies challenging the reliability of the principles of hair analysis, rendered the press release \"simply a confirmation of information that was already available in the public domain.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12348894\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/173/617/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12348894\" index=\"70\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/173/617/\">\n    at 625\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Instead, we held that the facts contained in the press release, including (1) the FBI's public admission about the flawed nature of its analysists' testimony and statements about microscopic hair comparison analysis and (2) the FBI's statement that it had trained state and local analysists to give the same flawed testimony in state criminal proceedings, were new. We thus found that the publication of the press release triggered the sixty-day window for the petitioner to file his claim concerning the microscopic hair comparison analysis testimony provided at his own criminal trial.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12348894\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/173/617/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12348894\" index=\"71\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/173/617/\">\n    at 626\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"Although the scientific foundation of such conclusory assertions was called into question beginning as early as 1974, and continually thereafter, this substantial shift in understanding was not embraced or acknowledged by the FBI until it went public with the preliminary results of its independent review.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12348894\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/173/617/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12348894\" index=\"72\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/173/617/\">\n    at 627\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (internal citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   As in\n   <em>\n    Chmiel\n   </em>\n   , although there was some publicly available information about Eakin's involvement in the email scandal in 2014, those news articles did not contain the facts upon which the claim raised in Robinson's third PCRA petition is predicated. Those facts were not knowable or made public until October 8, 2015, when the information concerning Eakin's sending and receiving of offensive emails became publicly available. This places Robinson's November 30, 2015 petition squarely within sixty days of that date.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9545(b)(2). Not until the release of these newly disclosed emails did the \"fact\" of Eakin's active participation in the transmission of offensive emails become known. Indeed, the disclosure of these new emails prompted the JCB to open a new ethics investigation against Eakin, which resulted in the JCB filing a complaint against him, disclosing numerous additional offensive emails both sent and received by Eakin.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   JCB Complaint, 12/8/2015, \u00b6\u00b6 78, 80-81 (detailing the emails disclosed in 2015);\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12348894\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/173/617/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 96, 99, 100 (alleging that Eakin's transmission and receipt of sexist, racist, homophonic, and religiously and ethnically insensitive emails constituted violations of the Pennsylvania Constitution and Canons of Judicial Conduct). The CJD ultimately sanctioned Eakin for these violations based on his exchange of these emails.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    In re Eakin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12197515\" index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/150/1042/#p1045\">\n    150 A.3d at 1061\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The Commonwealth does not raise a claim regarding the overarching relationship between the facts and the claim (i.e., the emails reflect bias against people of color and those affected by domestic abuse). Rather, it argues that the emails postdate Eakin's participation in Robinson's first PCRA appeal and that the emails do not mention his case (or any case) in particular, rendering Robinson's underlying due process claim meritless. This argument implicates the merits of the claim raised, not the timeliness of the petition. Indeed, as stated hereinabove, the Commonwealth argues that the absence of\n   a connection between the emails and Robinson's case renders the claims raised in his petition to be facially \"meritless.\" Commonwealth's Brief at 17. \"Whether a petitioner has carried his burden [of proving an exception to the PCRA's timeliness requirement] is a threshold inquiry that must be resolved prior to considering the merits of any claim.\"\n   <em>\n    Robinson III\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12281123,12281114,6800339,6800350\" index=\"75\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/139/178/\">\n    139 A.3d at 186\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The only elements required for the newly discovered facts exception to apply are that (1) the facts upon which the claim is predicated were unknown and (2) these facts could not have been discovered by the exercise of due diligence. 42 Pa.C.S. \u00a7 9545(b)(1)(ii) ;\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v.

We therefore find the Commonwealth's argument to be premature at this stage of the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   In reaching a contrary conclusion, Justice Dougherty in his Opinion in Support of Affirmance (\"OISA\") overlooks not only the Commonwealth's concession that a nexus between the emails and Robinson's case implicates the merits of the claim, but also this Court's longstanding interpretation of the newly discovered fact exception as requiring only the establishment of the two elements, described above. The OISA contends that racist, sexist and misogynistic emails cannot serve as facts upon which a due process violation can be predicated because the emails that have been disclosed thus far do not specifically mention Robinson or his case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   OISA (Dougherty, J.) at ---- - ----. The notion that Robinson was required to establish an individualized case reference in order to establish a claim of bias under these circumstances is not only myopic, it is dangerous, and could serve to eviscerate the newly discovered fact exception.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The fundamental flaw in the OISA's approach is revealed in its conclusion that Robinson fails to meet the newly discovered fact exception because the \"mere existence [of the emails] does not demonstrate the fact of bias.\"\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   OISA (Dougherty, J.) at ---- (quoting\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v.

The newly discovered \"fact\" here is the email communications by Eakin, not the existence of bias. According to Robinson, the emails reflect Eakin's bias; i.e., the claim (Eakin's bias in his decision making) is predicated on a newly discovered fact (the bigoted emails sent and received by Eakin).

In its Rule 1925(a) opinion, the PCRA court indicated that even if Robinson had timely filed his petition, Robinson was not entitled to discovery because he did not make \"a showing of 'exceptional circumstances' \" to support his\n   request. PCRA Court Opinion, 10/23/2017, at 11-12;\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   Pa.R.Crim.P. 902(E)(1). Specifically, it found that he failed to adduce any proof that the exchange of offensive emails by Justice Eakin occurred \"during the time of his conviction and appeal or that it affected his case in any way.\" PCRA Court Opinion, 10/23/2017, at 14. Further, the PCRA court faulted Robinson for \"cast[ing] a wide net\" in his discovery request, referring to it as \"generic, all-encompassing,\" and \"a forbidden fishing expedition.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8199427,8199379,3989088,3988926\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/959/306/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   These additional, non-jurisdictional bases for denying discovery are highly questionable. As stated hereinabove, the record reflects that the PCRA court, in fact, initially granted Robinson's June 15, 2016 discovery request. PCRA Court Order, 1/27/2017. It was not until the Commonwealth argued, and the PCRA court agreed, that the instant petition did not satisfy an exception to the PCRA's timeliness requirements that the court decided that Robinson was not entitled to discovery in this matter. We note that at least some of the information sought may be solely within the possession of the DA. However, the DA's arguments against the grant of discovery, and one of the PCRA court's alternative basis for denying Robinson's request, are based on Robinson's failure to present evidence in support of his claim. We further observe that there has been no fact finding conducted regarding the scope and breadth of this email scandal. The CJD did not conduct a full trial in Eakin's disciplinary matter (it adjudicated the case on stipulated facts) and the Disciplinary Board of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has not reported any action taken against any of the attorney senders and receivers of these emails. The only emails sent or received by Eakin that have been disclosed to date are those that were housed on the OAG's server.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   Nonetheless, as the issue of discovery implicates the merits of the claims raised, and because we would remand the case for the PCRA court to review the merits of his pending PCRA petition, we think it would have been prudent to allow the PCRA court to reconsider this issue as well. This would have allowed Robinson to file an amended request for discovery, modifying his request (if he deems it necessary) to address the concerns raised in the PCRA court's 1925(a) opinion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   Robinson's Brief at 58 (\"To the extent, however, that the lower court thought the request was overly broad, it could have granted the discovery request only in part or directed Mr. Robinson to tailor a more narrow request.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Disqualification of the DA from Further Proceedings\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   In his final issue on appeal, Robinson asserts that the PCRA court erred by denying his request to disqualify the DA from participating in further proceedings in this case. The PCRA court found that Robinson failed to establish that there were any ex parte communications between Eakin and the DA (or any members of the DA's office) or that an actual conflict of interest existed precluding the DA from representing the Commonwealth in this matter. It therefore found that he was not entitled to the appointment of a new prosecutor.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   Robinson contends that this finding was erroneous. In his brief before this Court, he states that the receipt by both Freed and Ebert of Eakin's emails \"potentially reflects on their reputations individually and on the reputation of the District Attorney's office\" and \"potentially colors their assessment of the offensiveness of the emails\" and the impact they had on the appellate review of Robinson's case. Robinson's Brief at 61. Further, Robinson states that bias is established based on the letters\n   sent to the CJD from Freed and Smith, both of whom indicated their close relationship with Eakin and expressed their personal opinions about the central issue involved in this case, i.e., whether Eakin exhibited bias in his judicial decisions.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 61-62. He contends that they both have \"personal stakes\" in the claims raised in his PCRA petition \"in ensuring that their longstanding friend suffered no consequences for his conduct.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 62\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   In his motion before this Court, he asserts that Ebert's resumption of his role as DA continues to require the disqualification of that office in this matter. He observes that, as a judge, Ebert was a signatory to a letter sent to the CJD in support of Eakin, wherein he \"candidly acknowledges the close personal ties\" between the two. Robinson's Motion to Disqualify the DA's Office, 4/17/2018, \u00b6\u00b6 5, 7. This letter resulted in Judge Guido recusing the entire Cumberland County bench from deciding Robinson's PCRA petition based on \"the appearance of a conflict of interest or impropriety,\" a finding that Robinson asserts necessarily should carry over to Ebert's decision making as the prosecutor in this matter.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 6, 7. Further, Robinson states that the now-publicly available emails reveal Ebert to have been \"a recipient of roughly twenty ... 'blast' emails that Justice Eakin also received, including a few that contained objectionable content.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 9. Robinson states that this information regarding Ebert reveals his personal interest in defending against the claims raised in Robinson's PCRA petition, as he would want to \"minimize the significance of the emails\" for his personal reputation and that of Eakin, his close friend, and \"impairs [his] independent judgment as a prosecutor.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6\u00b6 13-14. He asserts that Ebert's conflict, when combined with the aforementioned information regarding Freed and Smith and their relationships with Eakin, compounds the reputational concerns of the DA as an office.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   , \u00b6 11. According to Robinson, the continued participation of that office in his case \"threatens the fundamental fairness of these proceedings, and violates [his] right to due process of law.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.,\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 17.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   In response, the Commonwealth contends that because this case is on appeal, any prejudice arising from the alleged conflict the DA has \"is far less\" as \"the prosecution has far less discretion\" at the appellate stage.

Ebert, Freed and Smith all sent letters in support of Eakin to the JCB and advocated against disciplinary action for his conduct.

Granting Robinson relief on the instant PCRA petition would result in a finding that the emails sent and received by Eakin reflected his bias against various types of crimes and classes of people.

In my view, as the Commonwealth asserts, there is an insufficient nexus between the published reports and the alleged constitutional violation: the referenced \"email traffic relates to a time period beginning over a decade after [appellant's] trial and several years after his 2005 initial PCRA case concluded; [appellant's] case is not referenced in the emails; and the content does not reflect any invidious discrimination or bias in any court case.\" Commonwealth's Brief at 16-17.

I would conclude, as the PCRA court did, appellant made no proper showing to permit petition amendment or additional discovery. With respect to petition amendment, the OISR cites\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v.

The PCRA court considered the proposed petition amendments \"solely for the purpose of determining if they might somehow cure [appellant's] lack of timeliness in filing and grant jurisdiction to the [c]ourt[,]\" and concluded \"the changes proposed by [appellant] fail to cure the issue of timeliness.\" PCRA\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   Court Op., 10/23/17 at 10.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   If the claim were properly before us, I would determine the PCRA court correctly denied the requested petition amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   With respect to additional discovery, I am also aligned with the PCRA court's rationale for denying the request. The court noted discovery in PCRA proceedings is strictly limited and shall not be permitted except upon leave of court and a showing of exceptional circumstances.\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 11,\n   <em>\n    citing\n   </em>\n   Pa.R.Crim.P. 902(e). The court determined the discovery request was \"wholly without merit\" because appellant failed to demonstrate the existence of exceptional circumstances, and explained as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-134\">\n   While the facts underlying his claim reflect a disturbing state of affairs within the Pennsylvania Judiciary, [appellant] did not demonstrate that this circumstance existed during the time of his conviction and appeal or that it affected [the outcome of] his case in any way. No evidence was produced or alluded to that discusses or touches on [appellant's] case specifically. Likewise, his discovery request was not for specific, known, material, but rather he cast a wide net, hoping to snare something of both relevance and substance. Such a discovery request within the framework of collateral relief is a forbidden fishing expedition. Assuming the instant PCRA petition was timely filed, [appellant] failed to demonstrate the exceptional circumstances required for\n   <strong>\n    any\n   </strong>\n   discovery and, even if discovery was appropriate, [appellant's] generic, all-encompassing discovery request would have been impermissible.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-135\">\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 11, 14 (emphasis in original).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-136\">\n   <strong>\n    Disqualification of DAO\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   In my view, because appellant's PCRA petition was untimely and no exceptions applied, disqualification of the Cumberland County DAO is unnecessary and improper, as no jurisdiction exists to entertain further proceedings. Even if jurisdiction existed, I would deny the disqualification request. The OISR asserts appellant's claim is one of a conflict of interest that does not require a showing of actual impropriety.

Here, as in\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    Breakiron\n   </em>\n   , the claim of conflict arises at the post-conviction stage. In\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   , the public defender who represented the defendant on collateral appeal and sought withdrawal of the defendant's guilty plea in that proceeding, was appointed District Attorney during the pendency of the appeal. The petition was denied. On a second petition, represented by new counsel, the petitioner claimed the ineffectiveness of his prior post-conviction counsel \"due to the conflict of interest involving [counsel's] appointment as District Attorney[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Harris\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1782455\" index=\"153\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/501/178/\">\n    460 A.2d at 749\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The petitioner sought to withdraw his guilty plea, arguing the appointment created an actual conflict of interest and an appearance of impropriety. A plurality of the Court held an appearance of bias was insufficient to disqualify the prosecutor or undermine his participation in the post-conviction proceedings and a post-conviction petitioner must show actual impropriety. The plurality reasoned this heightened standard should be applied because there is far less danger of prejudice when a prosecutorial conflict arises during appellate proceedings.\n   <em>\n    Id\n   </em>\n   . at 750. I would apply this same rationale to the instant matter. During collateral proceedings, a petitioner has the burden to prove entitlement to relief, while the prosecutor merely responds to petitioner's arguments; the prosecutor's role is quite different in collateral proceedings than at trial. Because the discretion of the prosecutor is reduced during collateral proceedings, any prejudice flowing from his or her continued participation is limited. Thus, if the petition to disqualify the DAO were properly before the Court in the instant matter, I would conclude appellant failed to substantiate entitlement to relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     OPINION IN SUPPORT OF AFFIRMANCE\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   JUSTICE MUNDY\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   Consistent with my Opinion in Support of Affirmance (OISA) in\n   <em>\n    Commonwealth v.

The record is clear, however, the CJD \"accept[ed] [the parties'] stipulations of fact ... as\n    <strong>\n     the facts necessary\n    </strong>\n    for the determination of this case[,]\"\n    <em>\n     see\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12197515\" index=\"192\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/150/1042/#p1045\">\n     150 A.3d at 1048\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (emphasis added), and under the heading \"FINDINGS OF FACT\" included the fact that no evidence was presented showing Eakin's opinions reflected bias. I disagree with the OISR's minimization of this important aspect of the CJD's ruling.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"3\">\n   <p id=\"p-203\">\n    In opining the PCRA court had jurisdiction over the proceedings because new facts served to overcome the facially untimely nature of appellant's third petition, the OISR acknowledges another jurisdictional hurdle - the fact appellant filed his third petition prematurely. OISR (Donohue, J.) at ---- n.8. It is undisputed an appeal from appellant's second PCRA petition was pending before this Court when he filed the instant petition, his third. The OISR cites\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v. Lark\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"95775\" index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/560/487/\">\n     560 Pa. 487\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11471640,95775\" index=\"194\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/746/585/\">\n     746 A.2d 585\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 588 (2000) (subsequent PCRA petition cannot be filed while a pending petition remains unresolved), but treats the present petition as filed after his second petition was finally adjudicated. The OISR notes the Commonwealth presented no objection pursuant to\n    <em>\n     Lark\n    </em>\n    and this Court's disposition of appellant's appeal from the denial of his second PCRA petition was completed by the time the PCRA court finally adjudicated appellant's third petition. OISR (Donohue, J.) at ---- n.8. Without citation to authority, the OISR would determine \"in the interest of justice, we will regard as done that which ought to have been done\" and treat appellant's third petition as properly filed.\n    <em>\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11471640,95775\" index=\"195\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/746/585/\">\n      Id.\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    Respectfully, the proviso to regard as done that which ought to have been done has been employed by our courts almost exclusively in the interests of judicial economy. For example, where a party has inadvertently failed to file a praecipe for the entry of judgment or proper post-sentence motion, courts have occasionally, in the interests of judicial economy, permitted the appeal to proceed despite this minor procedural irregularity which would otherwise result in remand to perfect the record or quashal without prejudice to file a subsequent appeal once the trial court's final order has been reduced to judgment.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     McCormick v. Ne. Bank of Pa.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1818914\" index=\"196\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/522/251/\">\n     522 Pa. 251\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1818914\" index=\"197\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/522/251/\">\n     561 A.2d 328\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 330 n.1 (1989). To apply the proviso in the present circumstances expands its effect. Normally, the proviso is used to permit an\n    <strong>\n     appeal\n    </strong>\n    from an otherwise\n    <strong>\n     resolved\n    </strong>\n    case despite the lack of a final order. Here, the OISR would employ the proviso to permit\n    <strong>\n     post-conviction\n    </strong>\n    proceedings to advance in an\n    <strong>\n     unresolved\n    </strong>\n    case. That being said, the Commonwealth has failed to object to the PCRA court's jurisdiction in the present appeal on the basis of the premature filing. It maintains, instead, the PCRA court lacked jurisdiction due to appellant's failure to satisfy any exception to the PCRA time bar.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"4\">\n   <p id=\"p-204\">\n    Indeed, to permit an evidentiary hearing at which Eakin and his witnesses would presumably be called to testify on the question of bias would amount to the formalistic and pointless repetition of judicial proceedings, the outcome of which is undoubtedly a foregone conclusion.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"5\">\n   <p id=\"p-205\">\n    Among other things, the court specifically determined there was no merit in appellant's claimed applicability to his case of\n    <em>\n     Williams v. Pennsylvania\n    </em>\n    , --- U.S. ----,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597488\" index=\"198\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1899/\">\n     136 S.Ct. 1899\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12597488\" index=\"199\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1899/\">\n     195 L.Ed.2d 132\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2016) (justice's personal involvement in critical charging decision in defendant's case gave rise to unacceptable risk of actual bias endangering appearance of neutrality). The PCRA Court noted the facts underlying\n    <em>\n     Williams\n    </em>\n    are not substantially similar to appellant's case and\n    <em>\n     Williams\n    </em>\n    has no retroactive application in any event.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n </opinion>\n</casebody>\n"
