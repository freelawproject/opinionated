We affirm the order in part, reverse it in part, vacate the judgment of sentence, and remand for resentencing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The relevant facts and procedural history of this case are as follows. On February 20, 2011, Appellant shot Victim one time close range outside of a bar, and fled the scene in a car with two other men. Victim sustained injuries to his right back and chest, just inches from his heart, cracked\n   ribs, punctured lungs, and required extensive surgery. Victim survived the attack. The Commonwealth charged Appellant with attempted murder, aggravated assault, conspiracy, firearms not to be carried without a license, carrying firearms in public in Philadelphia, possessing an instrument of crime (\"PIC\"), simple assault, and recklessly endangering another person (\"REAP\"). The Commonwealth did not charge Appellant with attempted murder resulting in serious bodily injury and did not put Appellant on notice that the Commonwealth intended to pursue serious bodily injury related to the attempted murder charge. The criminal complaint and information did not allege Appellant caused serious bodily injury to Victim in connection with the attempted murder and the court did not instruct the jury to render a finding on whether serious bodily injury occurred with the criminal attempted murder.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The only mention of serious bodily injury related to the attempted murder charge was in the jury verdict sheet which contained an interrogatory to be answered if the jury found Appellant guilty of attempted murder. The interrogatory stated, \"Answer Only If Your Verdict On Attempted Murder Is Guilty[:] Do you find that the Complainant suffered serious bodily injury?\" (\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Verdict Report, dated 2/29/12, at 1; R.R. at 62.) Trial counsel did not object to the interrogatory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The jury convicted Appellant on February 29, 2012, of attempted murder, aggravated assault, PIC, firearms not to be carried without a license, and carrying firearms in public in Philadelphia. After the jury found Appellant guilty of attempted murder, the jury also answered, \"Yes,\" to the verdict interrogatory on serious bodily injury related to the attempted murder. On April 20, 2012, the court sentenced Appellant to an aggregate term of twenty (20) to forty (40) years' incarceration, which included an enhanced sentence for attempted murder/serious bodily injury of twenty (20) to forty (40) years. This Court affirmed the judgment of sentence on April 21, 2014; on October 6, 2014, our Supreme Court denied allowance of appeal.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

Appellant contends trial counsel was ineffective for several reasons. First, Appellant alleges trial counsel failed to conduct a reasonable pretrial investigation. If trial counsel had done so, Appellant insists trial counsel would have discovered Jamal Allen, who could testify that Appellant was not the shooter. Appellant further asserts he has not previously litigated this claim. Appellant concludes he is entitled to some form of relief.

The PCRA defines \"previous litigation\" as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-30\">\n   <strong>\n    \u00a7 9544.

Nevertheless, \"a reviewing court must consider and substantively analyze an ineffectiveness claim as a distinct legal ground for PCRA review because[,] while an ineffectiveness claim may fail for the same reasons that the underlying claim faltered on direct review, the Sixth Amendment basis for ineffectiveness claims technically creates a separate issue for review under the PCRA.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

In rejecting Appellant's claim, this Court stated:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-37\">\n   ...Appellant was required to demonstrate that he could not have obtained this evidence prior to the conclusion of the trial by the exercise of reasonable diligence. However, Appellant's\n   <em>\n    pro se\n   </em>\n   brief prevents him from establishing this element. In his brief, Appellant states that Mr. Allen was a co-worker of Appellant's, was a person known to Appellant, and was present at the time of the shooting. The only basis Appellant provides for failing to obtain this \"evidence\" sooner was that Mr. Allen did not want to get involved. We conclude that Appellant has fallen woefully short of establishing that the evidence contained in Mr. Allen's affidavit could not have been obtained through the exercise of reasonable diligence.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-38\">\n   It is well-settled that after-discovered evidence is new evidence, of which the appellant was unaware, that comes to light after trial. While Mr. Allen may have been reticent to testify, Appellant certainly could have subpoenaed the alleged exculpatory evidence. The rationale that Mr. Allen did not want to testify or would have been uncooperative if called as a witness does not equate to the alleged testimony being unavailable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Bickerstaff, supra\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   at *3 (internal citations omitted).

Appellant asserts this lack of a second preliminary hearing denied him his due process rights. Appellant maintains no reasonable attorney would have failed to move to quash the second information. Appellant concludes he is entitled to some form of relief. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Instantly, the PCRA court reasoned as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-42\">\n   [Appellant] claims that trial counsel's performance was deficient for \"failing to object to trial after his discharge following a preliminary hearing.\" This claim is meritless. Indeed, [Appellant] was discharged by Municipal Court Judge Harvey Robbins following his first preliminary hearing on March 10, 2011. However, the charges were refiled and [Appellant] was held for court on May 12, 2011, following a preliminary hearing before Common Pleas Court Judge Frank Palumbo. Thus, contrary to [Appellant's] assertion, trial counsel cannot be deemed ineffective for failing to file a meritless motion to quash.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   (PCRA Court Opinion, filed February 12, 2018, at 8). The record supports the trial court's analysis and belies Appellant's claim. Therefore, counsel cannot be deemed on PCRA review as ineffective for failing to pursue this claim.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Poplawski,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9230982\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/852/323/#p327\">\n      supra\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   In his third and fourth issues, Appellant asserts that trial counsel failed to protect Appellant against the imposition of an illegal sentence for attempted murder/serious bodily injury. Appellant alleges his sentence of 20 to 40 years' imprisonment is unlawful, as it exceeds the maximum penalty of 20 years' imprisonment for attempted murder as charged, without serious bodily injury. Appellant argues the Commonwealth did not give Appellant notice of its intent to prove serious bodily injury related to attempted murder, which increases the statutory maximum penalty for the attempted murder offense and must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt in connection with the attempted murder, under\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Apprendi v. New Jersey\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"26\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/\">\n    530 U.S. 466\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/\">\n    120 S.Ct. 2348\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/\">\n    147 L.Ed.2d 435\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000). Appellant insists the criminal information charged only attempted murder, the trial court did not give the jury an instruction on attempted murder/serious bodily injury, and the jury instruction on serious bodily injury related to aggravated assault was insufficient to cure the deficiencies in the attempted murder charge. Appellant submits the short special interrogatory on the verdict sheet alone was insufficient to merit the enhanced sentence he received. Appellant concludes trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the enhanced sentence under these circumstances, and the PCRA court erred in failing to vacate the illegal sentence imposed for Appellant's attempted murder conviction. Appellant concludes he is entitled to some form of relief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   In response, the Commonwealth contends it presented overwhelming and uncontroverted evidence that Victim suffered from a serious bodily injury. The Commonwealth\n   additionally alleges that Appellant stipulated to medical records establishing Victim's serious bodily injury. The Commonwealth concludes that although the trial court imposed an enhanced sentence for attempted murder without an explicit jury instruction of related serious bodily injury, the trial court's error was harmless, and provides no basis for relief, so trial counsel cannot be deemed ineffective on this ground. For the following reasons, we agree with Appellant's contentions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   A challenge to the legality of a sentence is a question of law.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Commonwealth v.

The panel vacated Barnes' sentence, reasoning the Commonwealth had failed to provide Barnes with notice of its intent to seek the enhanced 40-year sentence, where the charges, complaint, information, jury instructions, and verdict sheet lacked the element of serious bodily injury related to attempted murder. Additionally, the panel concluded that a jury finding of serious bodily injury for aggravated assault could not be used to infer a jury finding of serious bodily injury for attempted murder.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Barnes,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12319070\" index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/167/110/#p116\">\n      supra\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   In\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Johnson,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8445348\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/910/60/\">\n      supra\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , the defendant fired a gun at the victim's head and missed. After firing several more shots, Johnson struck the victim in the heel of her foot. A jury convicted Johnson of attempted murder and aggravated assault, among other crimes. The court imposed an enhanced\n   sentence of 17 \u00bd to 40 years' imprisonment for the attempted murder conviction, reasoning that the jury's finding of serious bodily injury associated with the aggravated assault conviction also established serious bodily injury for the attempted murder conviction. On appeal, Johnson contested the 40-year maximum sentence as illegal, because the Commonwealth failed to prove that the victim suffered serious bodily injury in connection with the attempted murder conviction.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   In keeping with\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Apprendi,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9413911\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/530/466/\">\n      supra\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , this Court said: \"[I]t was not the prerogative of the trial court, but solely the responsibility of the jury...to find, beyond reasonable doubt, whether a serious bodily injury resulted from the instant attempted murder.\"\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Johnson,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8445348\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/910/60/\">\n      supra\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8445348\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/910/60/\">\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </strong>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8445348\" index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/910/60/\">\n    at 67\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In arriving at its decision, this Court emphasized the Commonwealth: (1) had not charged Johnson with attempted murder/serious bodily injury; (2) had not put Johnson on notice that the Commonwealth would try to prove attempted murder/serious bodily injury; (3) did not prosecute Johnson for attempted murder/serious bodily injury; (4) did not request and the court did not instruct the jury on serious bodily injury associated with the attempted murder offense; and (5) did not ask the jury to render a verdict on that question. The\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Johnson\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   Court concluded the jury verdict was limited to a finding of guilty on the crime of attempted murder generally, which carried a maximum sentence of only 20 years. Accordingly, this Court affirmed the convictions but vacated the entire judgment of sentence and remanded for re-sentencing on all outstanding convictions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   Instantly, as in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Barnes,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12319070\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/167/110/#p116\">\n      supra\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Johnson,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8445348\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/910/60/\">\n      supra\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , the Commonwealth charged Appellant with only attempted murder generally and did not include the element of serious bodily injury in the criminal complaint or information. The Commonwealth also failed to put Appellant on notice that the Commonwealth intended to prove attempted murder/serious bodily injury at trial. The Commonwealth did not prosecute Appellant for attempted murder/serious bodily injury. Furthermore, the court did not instruct the jury on serious bodily injury related to the attempted murder offense. Instead, the court gave a jury instruction only on serious bodily injury related to aggravated assault. Here, Appellant was essentially ambushed with the verdict sheet's special interrogatory that raised for the first time a question about serious bodily injury in connection with attempted murder. Prior to the interrogatory, Appellant had no warning that there was even an issue of serious bodily injury associated with attempted murder. The charges, complaint, information, and jury instructions for attempted murder made no mention of associated serious bodily injury. Absent more, this surprise interrogatory was not enough to put Appellant on notice to defend against attempted murder/serious bodily injury.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Ohle,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1785935\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/pa/503/566/#p588\">\n      supra\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . Due to this lack of notice and Appellant's resultant inability to defend, counsel should have objected to the interrogatory before the jury deliberated. Counsel had no rational basis for failing to object to the interrogatory, given the lack of notice, and counsel's failure to object prejudiced Appellant, because it caused Appellant to endure a conviction for attempted murder with serious bodily injury and set Appellant up to face a maximum sentence of 40 years for that offense, rather than 20 years for attempted murder generally. Moreover, when the court imposed the enhanced sentence for attempted murder/serious bodily injury, based solely on the jury's response to the interrogatory, counsel again failed to object. Thus, we agree with Appellant's contention that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to protect Appellant from the sentence\n   enhancement for attempted murder/serious bodily injury.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Kimball, supra\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   Furthermore, we reject the Commonwealth's contention that the imposition of an enhanced sentence for attempted murder/serious bodily injury in this case was harmless error. We recognize that in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Barnes,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12319070\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/167/110/#p116\">\n      supra\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Johnson,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8445348\" index=\"61\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/910/60/\">\n      supra\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   , there was no special interrogatory on the jury verdict sheet. Nevertheless, a similar error occurred here, when the jury was asked for the first time to take the serious bodily injury associated with the aggravated assault offense and transfer it to the attempted murder offense, which is just another form of the impropriety denounced in\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Barnes,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12319070\" index=\"62\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/167/110/#p116\">\n      supra\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   and\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Johnson,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8445348\" index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/910/60/\">\n      supra\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   . We conclude the special interrogatory presented to the jury did not serve to mitigate the fundamental injustice in the present case. Therefore, we decline the Commonwealth's specious invitation to declare the error harmless.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Based upon the foregoing, we hold the PCRA court properly rejected Appellant's complaints of trial counsel's ineffectiveness concerning the \"absent witness\" and the \"second preliminary hearing\"; and Appellant is not entitled to relief on those issues. We hold, however, that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to protect Appellant from the sentence enhancement for attempted murder/serious bodily injury. Thus, we vacate the enhanced sentence for attempted murder/serious bodily injury as an illegal sentence.\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     Infante,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7308438\" index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/63/358/#p363\">\n      supra\n     </extracted-citation>\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   .
