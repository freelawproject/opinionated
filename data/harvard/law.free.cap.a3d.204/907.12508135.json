Within weeks, Mondsini faced a natural disaster of epic proportions, Super Storm Sandy, which struck New Jersey on October 29, causing catastrophic damage to homes, businesses and the State's infrastructure. The Authority lost electrical power during the storm and maintained operations by using diesel generators. If the generators failed, millions of gallons of untreated sewage would discharge into the Rockaway River. The situation grew critical as the Authority anticipated it would run out of diesel fuel by November 2.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Certain Authority employees were essential to keep the generators operating. Because of a statewide gasoline shortage, these employees were unable to fuel their personal vehicles to drive to and from work. Mondsini authorized several employees to fuel their personal vehicles from an Authority gasoline pump. She contacted the Regional Operations Intelligence Center, a statewide emergency management consortium, and advised of the critical situation the Authority faced.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Bruce MacNeal was a member of the Authority's Board of Commissioners and served as board secretary. As such, he was an employee of the Authority and was authorized to sign the Authority's checks. On November 2, MacNeal, who often came to the Authority to sign checks and otherwise keep abreast of its activities, arrived and offered his assistance to Mondsini. She had MacNeal sign two checks in anticipation of a diesel oil delivery later that day. She also asked if he could \"commandeer a gas station\" in Boonton, where MacNeal lived, to supply gas to the Authority's essential personnel, and obtain food from restaurants that might be open to feed Authority personnel on site.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   While discussing the gasoline shortage, MacNeal said he needed to find gasoline himself. Mondsini authorized MacNeal to fuel his personal vehicle from the Authority's pump. Unbeknownst to Mondsini, MacNeal fueled\n   <em>\n    two\n   </em>\n   personal vehicles with the Authority's gasoline. Mondsini advised the Board of her actions regarding the crisis at its next meeting on Thursday, November 8.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   An unknown informant complained to law enforcement authorities about Authority employees using agency gasoline for personal use during the storm. The report was referred to the Local Finance Board (LFB). After investigation, the LFB found Mondsini violated N.J.S.A. 40A:9-22.5(c) (subsection (c) ), a provision of the Local Government Ethics Law (LGEL), N.J.S.A. 40A:9-22.1 to -22.25, which provides: \"No local government officer or employee shall use or attempt to use his official position to secure unwarranted privileges or advantages for himself or others.\" The\n   LFB assessed a $ 100 fine against Mondsini, which it simultaneously waived.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Mondsini appealed, and the matter was transferred to the Office of Administrative Law as a contested case. The Authority intervened in support of Mondsini. After denying the LFB's motion for summary decision, the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) conducted a hearing and rendered an initial decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Among other things, the ALJ found Mondsini to be a credible witness and concluded she had not violated the LGEL.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   He reasoned that a violation of subsection (c) \"requires a showing of intent.\" The ALJ also rejected the LFB's contention that Mondsini secured an \"unwarranted\" privilege for MacNeal because he was not an \"essential employee\" and obtained gasoline that was unavailable to the public. Finding Mondsini's \"sole intent was to keep the plant up and running\" during the crisis, the ALJ concluded she \"acted prudently. To permit the LFB to use hindsight to say this was a violation of the [LGEL] would have local government officials afraid to perform their jobs.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In its final agency decision, the LFB accepted the ALJ's findings of fact, with only one modification, i.e., the ALJ's assessment that the testimony of the LFB's investigator was less than credible. The LFB, however, rejected the ALJ's legal conclusions, asserting subsection (c) does not \"require[ ] a showing of intent.\" In addition, the LFB rejected the ALJ's suggestion that the LGEL includes a \"crisis exception.\" The LFB reinstated the violation and penalty, but once again waived its enforcement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   We consolidated the appeals filed by Mondsini (A-4482-16), and the Authority, which intervened before the LFB (A-4504-16), to issue a single opinion. Mondsini argues subsection (c) requires proof of \"specific intent\" to violate its provisions, and she never acted to \"secure unwarranted privileges or advantages\" for MacNeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The Authority reiterates these arguments and further contends that the LFB erred by concluding MacNeal was not an essential employee of the Authority, duly authorized under the Sewerage Authorities Law, N.J.S.A. 40:14A-1 to -45, to perform certain functions. It also argues the LFB lacked jurisdiction in this matter pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:14A-35.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   I.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   We begin by noting \"[j]udicial review of agency determinations is limited.\"\n   <em>\n    Allstars Auto Grp., Inc. v.

'secured the advantage of improving the parking for [Zisa's] tenant.' \"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2894285\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/385/188/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2894285\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/385/188/\">\n    at 195\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2894285\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/385/188/\">\n    896 A.2d 1111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   In reversing, we noted there was nothing in the record demonstrating Zisa's tenant, i.e., the school district, required paved parking spaces, so there was no advantage to Zisa in having the lot paved.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2894285\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/385/188/\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   We did not address whether subsection (c) required proof of specific intent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   Although the Legislature did not use the words \"for the purpose of\" in subsection (c) as it did in subsections (f) and (g), it\n   nevertheless prohibited the use or attempted use of public office to achieve a particular end, i.e., \"to secure unwarranted privileges or advantages ....\" N.J.S.A. 40A:9-22.5(c). As such, the mere public perception of impropriety does not violate subsection (c); a violation requires proof that the public official intended to use his or her office for a specific purpose. Our conclusion is strengthened by the Legislature's decision to proscribe an official's\n   <em>\n    attempted\n   </em>\n   , albeit unsuccessful, use of his or her office to secure unwarranted privileges or advantages. By definition, to attempt something is \"[t]o try to do, make, or achieve\" it, whether successful or not.\n   <em>\n    Webster's II New College Dictionary\n   </em>\n   74 (3rd ed. 2005).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   As a result, based on subsection (c)'s plain and unambiguous language, we conclude that a public official or employee only violates this provision of the LGEL if she uses or attempts to use her official position with the intent to secure unwarranted advantages or privileges for herself or another. In this case, the ALJ found as a fact that Mondsini lacked such a purpose, and that her only purpose in allowing MacNeal to use the Authority's gasoline was to keep the Authority operating during the crisis. The LFB accepted these factual findings. We therefore reverse the Agency's decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   For the sake of completeness, we address whether Mondsini secured an \"unwarranted privilege or advantage\" for MacNeal by authorizing his use of the Authority's gasoline. Based on its interpretation of our decision in\n   <em>\n    Zisa\n   </em>\n   , the LFB concluded she did. The LFB emphasized that MacNeal obtained something unavailable to the public. It concluded that permitting him to fuel a personal vehicle was an unauthorized exercise of Mondsini's powers, because MacNeal was not an essential employee, and Mondsini could have provided a \"fleet vehicle\" for MacNeal to use as he sought gasoline from nearby vendors.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Pursuant to rules of statutory construction, we accord words \"their generally accepted meaning.\" N.J.S.A. 1:1-1. \"Unwarranted\" is defined as \"[h]aving no justification.\"\n   <em>\n    Webster's II New College Dictionary\n   </em>\n   1240 (3rd ed. 2005). The legislative history of the\n   LGEL provides no further guidance on what is an \"unwarranted privilege or advantage,\" nor\n   does our review of decisions under the ethics laws of some of our sister states that use identical language.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=N.Y.%20Pub.%20Off.%20Law%20%C2%A7%2074\">\n     N.Y.

Ann. Laws\n   </em>\n   ch. 268A, \u00a7 23 (2018). In\n   <em>\n    Zisa\n   </em>\n   , we defined \"unwarranted\" consistently with its plain meaning, as a privilege or advantage \"that is\n   <em>\n    unjustified or unauthorized\n   </em>\n   , one that would permit the municipal official to obtain something otherwise not available to the public at large.\"\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2894285\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/385/188/\">\n    385 N.J. Super. at 196\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2894285\" index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj-super/385/188/\">\n    896 A.2d 1111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Here, of course, although not designated before the storm as an essential employee, and, as the ALJ concluded, Mondsini did not ask MacNeal to come to the Authority, MacNeal was nevertheless one of its employees. We do not think, however, that being an employee in and of itself is dispositive of whether the privilege or advantage is \"unwarranted.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   However, once MacNeal was there, Mondsini exercised her executive authority and told MacNeal he could use the Authority's gasoline, hoping he could secure more gasoline and food for essential workers. There is no authority cited by the LFB that prohibited Mondsini from exercising her powers this way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   This is not to say that simply authorizing some particular use of agency personnel or resources immunizes a local official or employee from violating subsection (c). If, for example, the privilege or advantage was secured through the unauthorized exercise of an official's duties, or the exercise of those duties in an unauthorized manner, the official could be subject to penalties under subsection (c).\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   , N.J.S.A. 2C:30-2(a) (by way of analogy, defining the criminal offense of official misconduct).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   However, there was no evidence that Mondsini exceeded her authority under the Sewerage Authorities Law, or the Authority's governing documents. Nor do we accept the LFB's reasoning that Mondsini acted in an unauthorized manner because other options existed, e.g., providing a \"fleet vehicle\" to MacNeal. We\n   refuse to engage in such \"Monday morning quarterbacking.\" Even when applying broader principles of disqualification based upon the appearance of competing public and private interests, the Court made clear: \"The [LGEL] must be applied with caution, as '[l]ocal governments would be seriously handicapped if every possible interest, no matter how remote and speculative, would serve as a disqualification of an official.' \"\n   <em>\n    Grabowsky\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4206423\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/221/536/#p552\">\n    221 N.J. at 554\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4206423\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/221/536/#p552\">\n    115 A.3d 815\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (second alteration in original) (quoting\n   <em>\n    Wyzykowski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"710802\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/132/509/#p531\">\n    132 N.J. at 523\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"710802\" index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/132/509/#p531\">\n    626 A.2d 406\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Lastly, the LFB rejected any consideration of the undisputed fact that Mondsini faced an emergency of significant magnitude involving a threat to the public safety of untold thousands and criticized the ALJ's conclusion because it created an \"emergency exception\" to the LGEL. This contention overlooks a longstanding and essential premise of our jurisprudence that predates enactment of the LGEL, namely that in the area of ethical concerns, evaluation of any public official's actions \"must be carefully evaluated based on the circumstances of the specific case.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"710802\" index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/132/509/#p531\">\n     Ibid.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   (citing\n   <em>\n    Van Itallie\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"560979\" index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nj/28/258/#p268\">\n    28 N.J. at 268\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=146%20A.2d%20111\">\n    146 A.2d 111\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   We reverse in A-4482-16.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   III.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   We have already addressed most of the issues raised by the Authority's appeal.
