Strong, Ross O. Little, Kip Clayton Strong, John Henry Strong, and Allana Hope Strong (collectively, the \"Strong Family\") seeking court approval of its resignation as co-trustee of the Strong Family Trust and a complete release from liability. In response, the Strong Family filed counterclaims alleging breach of contract, breach of duty of loyalty, breach of fiduciary duty, and violation of the District of Columbia Consumer Protection Procedures Act (\"CPPA\"). The only issue before us is the trial court's grant of summary judgment on the CPPA counterclaim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   We vacate the section of the trial court's judgment concerning the CPPA counterclaim and remand with instructions to dismiss for lack of standing.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    I. Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In its counterclaim, the Strong Family alleges SunTrust violated the CPPA by making false representations about a proposed fee increase, its right to unilaterally increase its fees, and its right to resign as corporate trustee and obtain a complete release of liability. The Strong Family did not pay the higher fees, nor did it sign the broad release proffered by SunTrust. Nevertheless, it invokes the CPPA, which provides in part that it is \"a violation of this chapter for any person to engage in an unfair or deceptive trade practice, whether or not any consumer is in fact misled, deceived, or damaged thereby, including to misrepresent as to a material fact which has a tendency to mislead.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2028-3904\">\n    D.C.

Appellants Have Not Alleged a Concrete Injury\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   At oral argument, counsel for the Strong Family cited cases to support the proposition that incurring attorney's fees is sufficient to establish a concrete injury.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   We will assume, without deciding, that those cases are soundly reasoned, but they are distinguishable from the case before this court. The cases proffered by the Strong Family involved \"wrongful\" and \"abusive\" legal proceedings which allegedly violated the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA).\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Demarais\n   </em>\n   , 869 F.3d at 691-93 (consumer sufficiently alleged a concrete injury based in part on need to hire counsel to defend against allegedly false representations in pleadings and use of unfair litigating tactics in attempt to collect a debt that had been extinguished);\n   <em>\n    Cook\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2018%20WL%201377906\">\n    2018 WL 1377906\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3 (plaintiff property owner had standing to bring claim for damages based on expenses incurred in defending against an allegedly unlawful foreclosure action brought by bank);\n   <em>\n    Mogg\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2016%20WL%204395899\">\n    2016 WL 4395899\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , at *3-4 (plaintiff's concrete injury included costs incurred to defend against an allegedly unlawful debt collection action filed after plaintiff had filed bankruptcy petition).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The Strong Family identifies its injury as the need to pay attorney's fees incurred\n   in responding to SunTrust's lawsuit. However, the complaint filed by SunTrust was not based on the misrepresentations the family claims SunTrust made in earlier correspondence. SunTrust sought court approval to resign as co-trustee, a right recognized under the Uniform Trust Code.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2019-1307.05\">\n    D.C.

TRUST CODE \u00a7 705(a)(2) (2000) (\"A trustee may resign [w]ith the approval of the court.\"). The suit itself was not part of an unfair trade practice that would violate the CPPA.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Although SunTrust may have sought from the court a broader release than it was entitled to, it did not base that request for relief on any misrepresentations made to the Strong Family. As the trial court recognized, the scope of release from liability is also addressed in the Uniform Trust Code.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=D.C.%20Code%20%C2%A7%2019-1307.05\">\n    D.C.

Thus, the expenditure of attorney's fees by the Strong Family is not \"fairly traceable\" to any misrepresentation made by SunTrust. Aside from attorney's fees, the Strong Family has not alleged any particularized or concrete injury in fact or \"risk of real harm,\"\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Spokeo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12596653\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/s-ct/136/1540/#p1549\">\n    136 S.Ct. at 1543\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , flowing from any alleged misrepresentations made by SunTrust. As a result, the Strong Family has not shown that it has standing to bring its CPPA counterclaim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   <strong>\n    IV. Conclusion\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   For the reasons stated above, the portion of the Superior Court judgment addressing appellants' Consumer Protection Procedures Act counterclaim is vacated and this case is remanded with instructions to dismiss that counterclaim for lack of standing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   <em>\n    It is so ordered.\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-25\">\n    All counts having been disposed of without trial, this order granting summary judgment and entering judgment as to the remaining counts is a final appealable order.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-26\">\n    SunTrust argues that the CPPA does not apply to the administration of trusts because the Strong Family was not a consumer and SunTrust was not a merchant of consumer goods or services.
