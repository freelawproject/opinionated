On or about September 26, 2016, the Huntingdon County Tax Claim Bureau (Tax Claim Bureau) conducted an upset tax sale of the Property pursuant to RETSL. Petition to Redeem at 2. Saratoga Partners, L.P.

The Fouses also asked the trial court to \"issue a [r]ule upon Respondent, Saratoga Partners to show cause why the relief requested ... should not be granted and to issue an [o]rder to ... the Tax Claim Bureau, to withhold any deed it intends to issue to Saratoga Partners until such time as the [r]ule [is] satisfied.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   at 3.

Additionally, \"\n   <em>\n    [w]hether the judicial sale is effected under the MCTLA or the RETSL the intent of the legislature is the same: to return real property to productive use under new ownership\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <em>\n    Kauth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8951347\" index=\"87\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/874/164/\">\n    874 A.2d at 169\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (emphasis added).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Against this background, the Majority discerns a rational basis for the General Assembly's differential classification of the RETSL and MCTLA by focusing on the fact that Pennsylvania's first and second class counties, Philadelphia County and Allegheny County, have greater populations than the other counties. From this, the Majority posits that Philadelphia County and Allegheny County \"have larger pools of prospective buyers at tax sales,\" which \"make it more likely that a property will be sold at a tax sale.\" Maj. op. at 1038. Therefore, according to the Majority, \"the need for owner protection is greater\" and this \"need is met\" with the right of redemption found in the MCTLA. Maj. op. at 1038. The Majority also asserts that, by virtue of having comparatively higher population figures, Philadelphia County and Allegheny County contain \"a larger taxable base from which to derive revenue\" and, as such, \"the General Assembly could have reasoned that these counties can afford a less efficient process for collecting delinquent taxes by providing a post-tax-sale right of redemption.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8951347\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/874/164/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   However, the justifications conceived by the Majority are refuted and rendered implausible in light of section 39.5 of the MCTLA,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   which provides that \"[t]he tax claim bureaus of the several counties may adopt and use the procedures set forth in this act in addition to the procedures set forth in the [RETSL].\" 53 P.S. \u00a7 7193.5. Since the counties that are covered under the RETSL, including the least populous eighth class county, can elect to use the additional and alternative procedure of the MCTLA, along with its right of redemption, there is no apparent basis relating\n   specifically to differences in population that would rationalize excluding the right of redemption from the RETSL.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Shapiro v.

While the General Assembly unconditionally granted homeowners with property in Philadelphia County and Allegheny County such a right, it did not provide or expressly bestow this right upon any other homeowner of the other counties in the Commonwealth who fall within the ambit of the RETSL. It should be beyond dispute that, no matter where a homeowner resides, that homeowner shares the same interest in redemption as any other homeowner located anywhere else in the Commonwealth. In terms of equal protection, the federal and state constitutions \"both reflect the principle that like persons in like circumstances must be treated similarly\" and \"a classification will be struck down if it is based upon artificial or irrelevant distinctions[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Harrisburg School District v.

Through its operation, the MCTLA grants a privilege and benefit upon one class of individuals as a matter of right and, apart from a mere preference for one group over another, I cannot ascertain why the General Assembly has not afforded the same right to the class of individuals covered under and subjected to the RETSL. Consequently, I\n   would conclude that the RETSL fails the rational basis test and would declare that the statute, on its face, violates the rights of equal protection under the United States and Pennsylvania Constitutions. I, therefore, would enjoin enforcement of the RETSL and enter an order requiring all the counties in the Commonwealth to utilize the MCTLA (which they are already authorized to do) as the sole procedure through which to conduct tax sales,\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   thereby ensuring that all the homeowners in this Commonwealth are treated alike and are vested with the right to redeem their property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   Hence, I respectfully dissent.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-49\">\n    Saratoga Partners, L.P.
