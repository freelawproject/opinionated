Ives, M.D., petitions for review of an adjudication of the State Board of Medicine (Board) concluding that Dr. Ives performed a surgery in 2012 that departed from the accepted standard of care. The Board ordered Dr. Ives to undergo a clinical competency skills assessment and a public reprimand. On appeal, Dr. Ives contends,\n   <em>\n    inter alia\n   </em>\n   , that the Board erred and abused its discretion in admitting hearsay evidence and relying on an expert opinion that was incompetent on the issue of standard of care because it lacked a proper factual foundation. Concluding that these issues have merit, we reverse the Board's adjudication.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   <strong>\n    Background\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On December 2, 1986, Dr. Ives was licensed to practice medicine and surgery in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. He is certified by the American Board of Surgery. Dr. Ives practices as a general and colorectal surgeon, with staff privileges at Lancaster General Hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On December 28, 2012, Dr. Ives operated on S.L. (Patient) at Ephrata Community Hospital to remove a colon tumor in a surgery that took several hours. During surgery, Patient began to bleed, which the operating team was unable to stop. A second surgeon called by Dr. Ives was also unable to stop the bleeding. Dr. Ives ordered an infusion of platelets for Patient to stop the bleeding, but the platelets were not delivered by the hospital. Patient was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU), where she died three hours later while awaiting a transfer to Hershey Medical Center.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On March 30, 2015, the Board instituted a disciplinary action against Dr. Ives, alleging that his treatment of Patient fell below the accepted standard of care. The Board sought a license suspension, revocation or restriction, penalties and costs. In October 2016, an administrative hearing was held. The Department of State's Bureau of Professional and Occupational Affairs (Bureau) prosecuted the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Christopher Connolly, an investigator for the Bureau, testified about the records he obtained from Ephrata Community Hospital by subpoena. Specifically, Connolly obtained Patient's medical records and the transcripts of a peer review proceeding conducted by Ephrata Community Hospital to revoke Dr. Ives' staff privileges.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   Gordon L. Kauffman, Jr., M.D., testified on behalf of the Bureau. Dr. Kauffman is a Professor Emeritus at the Pennsylvania State University, College of Medicine in Hershey, Pennsylvania, where he served as a professor of surgery for 32 years. He is certified by the American Board of Surgery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Dr. Kauffman testified that the Bureau retained him to evaluate Dr. Ives' treatment of Patient. To that end, he reviewed Patient's medical records and the transcripts\n   from the peer review proceeding (Peer Review Transcript) conducted by Ephrata Community Hospital. Dr. Kauffman prepared an expert report that concluded that Dr. Ives failed to meet the accepted standard of care in three ways: (1) Dr. Ives did not \"seem to give any credence\" to what was being told to him by the anesthesiology team during the surgery; (2) Dr. Ives' \"responses to the anesthesia team\" reflected \"a lack of engagement or inability to accept concerns of a less than favorable outcome\" that led him to continue, not terminate, the surgery; and (3) postoperatively, Dr. Ives abandoned Patient, leaving her in the ICU in the care of another physician. Kauffman Report at 5-6; Reproduced Record at 1090a-91a (R.R. ____).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In support of these conclusions, Dr. Kauffman presented a narrative of what happened to Patient during surgery. This narrative was based upon the documents obtained by Connolly from Ephrata Community Hospital related to the peer review proceeding.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Dr. Kauffman stated that, on November 26, 2012, Dr. Ives met with Patient, who was experiencing blood in her stools. On November 30, 2012, a colonoscopy was performed that showed \"a nearly obstructing colorectal carcinoma at rectal sigmoid junction[.]\" Notes of Testimony, 10/24/2016, at 28 (N.T. __); R.R. 41a. Patient elected to have the tumor surgically removed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On December 28, 2012, at approximately 8:00 a.m., Dr. Ives began the surgery to remove the tumor. At 10:45 a.m., the anesthesia records showed that Patient's hematocrit\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and hemoglobin\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   levels had fallen and that there was bleeding. The nurse anesthetist spoke to Dr. Ives about the blood loss. At 11:00 a.m., the nurse anesthetist again spoke to Dr. Ives about Patient's blood loss, and Patient was administered a unit of packed red blood cells. Dr. Kauffman testified that Dr. Ives proceeded with the surgery in spite of the concern expressed about Patient's blood loss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Dr. Kauffman stated that around 12:00 p.m., the anesthesia records reported cardiovascular instability. At 12:45 p.m., Patient received a vasoconstrictor medication to increase her blood pressure. The operating room team, concerned about Patient's ongoing blood loss, suggested that Dr. Ives call a second surgeon for assistance. Dr. Ives did not do so. At 2:00 p.m., Patient was hypotensive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   At 3:00 p.m., Dr. Ives requested surgical assistance. When the second surgeon arrived, Patient was in shock. The second surgeon packed Patient's abdomen and sewed two arteries to the pelvis to reduce the ongoing bleeding. These efforts did not improve Patient's condition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Regarding the accepted standard of care on Dr. Ives' communication with and responses to the anesthesia team, Dr. Kauffman testified as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-23\">\n   [There was a]\n   <em>\n    lack of discussion between Dr. Ives and the anesthesia team, between Dr. Ives and the [operating room] team\n   </em>\n   . Other people could see that the blood loss was continuing without control. They mentioned that to him. So lack of getting control of the bleeding, lack of a dialogue that's critical in situations like this between the surgeon and\n   the anesthesia team, the surgeon and the [operating room] team...\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-24\">\n   ... Dr. Ives did not seem to give any credence to what was being told to him by the anesthesia team and the [operating room] staff. Rather than considering what was occurring at several time points, perhaps packing to control bleeding when the patient was unstable from a cardiovascular standpoint, allowing the anesthesia team to catch up with the blood loss,\n   <em>\n    recognizing much earlier that hemostasis was inadequate, and requesting surgical support from a surgical or gynecological colleague would have been the standard of care\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   N.T. 48-50; R.R. 61a-63a (emphasis added). With respect to postoperative abandonment, Dr. Kauffman testified: \"In my opinion, the surgeon stays with the patient until some final disposition is made.\" N.T. 58; R.R. 71a. Dr. Kauffman opined that Dr. Ives compromised Patient's care by leaving the hospital.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Dr. Kauffman opined that when Patient became unstable at 2:00 p.m., the accepted standard of care required Dr. Ives to establish hemostasis rather than proceed with the operation. Dr. Kauffman also opined that by waiting until 3:00 p.m. to call a second surgeon, Dr. Ives departed from an acceptable standard of care. Had assistance been called earlier, the outcome could have been different.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   On cross-examination, Dr. Kauffman acknowledged that he did not know that during the surgery Dr. Ives had ordered platelets for Patient that were never delivered. He also did not know that Dr. Ives transferred Patient's care in the ICU to another physician only because he had been called to an emergency at another hospital. Dr. Kauffman did not know that Dr. Ives met with Patient's family in the ICU before departing the hospital. In addition, Dr. Kauffman acknowledged that he had not reviewed Patient's postoperative records, her fluid intake and output report, and the record of Dr. Ives' orders during surgery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   At the conclusion of its case, the Bureau moved for the admission of a letter from Ephrata Community Hospital, Patient's medical records, the Peer Review Transcript, and Dr. Kauffman's\n   <em>\n    curriculum vitae\n   </em>\n   and expert report.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Dr. Ives then testified. He explained that in addition to removing the tumor, it was necessary to do a hysterectomy because the tumor had connected to Patient's uterus. He estimated the surgery would take approximately four to five hours.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Dr. Ives testified that when he made a midline incision on Patient's abdomen, he noticed \"a little bit more oozing\" than expected. N.T. 141; R.R. 154a. At approximately 10:45 a.m., the nurse anesthetist informed him of Patient's hemoglobin and hematocrit levels. However, Dr. Ives did not consider these levels striking because Patient was receiving crystalloid fluids, which cause hemoglobin and hematocrit levels to drop. The anesthesia team suggested giving blood to Patient, and he agreed. Dr. Ives explained that he is generally hesitant to give blood to a cancer patient because the transfusion can suppress the immune system. At 11:30 a.m., Dr. Ives gave the order to maintain two units of packed red blood cells at all times. At 12:15 p.m., he ordered two units of fresh frozen plasma.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Dr. Ives testified that at approximately 2:00 p.m., Patient became hypotensive. The anesthesiologist called out to \"hold up\" because the anesthesiology team needed \"to catch up.\" N.T. 144; R.R. 157a. Dr. Ives stated that he immediately stopped, packed Patient, and inquired into what was going on. He then learned how much blood Patient had lost, which Dr. Ives described\n   as \"staggering.\" N.T. 146; R.R. 159a. Dr. Ives testified that because the anesthesiologist did not notify him each time Patient was given blood (and usually does not do so), Dr. Ives \"didn't realize how much blood was lost.\" N.T. 148; R.R. 161a. Fresh frozen plasma usually stops bleeding in patients with a bleeding disorder. Because the frozen plasma did not achieve this result, Dr. Ives ordered platelets for Patient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Dr. Ives denied failing to respond when Patient became unstable from a cardiovascular standpoint. He testified that\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-33\">\n   <em>\n    whenever she became unstable, I immediately stopped\n   </em>\n   . There's no sense in continuing if the patient might not survive. So when they said she was unstable, I immediately packed her[.]\n   <em>\n    I waited until they gave the okay to finish the resection\n   </em>\n   and I rapidly got the specimen out. So within about 15 minutes or so after that, I had the specimen out. And the rest of the case, as long as everything is packed, you're hoping that they're going to be able to accomplish something until [the other surgeon] came in.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   N.T. 173; R.R. 186a (emphasis added). Dr. Ives testified that he packed the abdomen and pelvis for an hour, but the blood loss did not stop. He then asked for surgical assistance.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Dr. Ives disputed Dr. Kauffman's opinion that he should have earlier requested help from another surgeon, stating that he did not need \"surgical help for any technical\" issues. N.T. 173; R.R. 186a. When Dr. Ives requested surgical assistance, it was because he was hoping for suggestions on how to stop the bleeding while they awaited the delivery of platelets.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   Dr. Ives testified that Patient had a bleeding disorder, which was unknown before the surgery. The only chance of arresting her blood loss was with platelets. He ordered platelets twice, but they were not delivered in time to save Patient.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   <strong>\n    Board Adjudication\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   On March 20, 2017, the hearing examiner issued a proposed adjudication. In pertinent part, the hearing examiner found:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-39\">\n   44.

The Board did not see or hear the persons who testified in Ephrata Community Hospital's peer review proceeding, which was private and conducted for a specific, but different, purpose. Dr. Ives' peers did not produce a report that evaluated the evidence presented. Stated otherwise, it is impossible to know what credibility determinations they made on the basis of witness demeanor or whether they accepted any of the witnesses' interpretations. Dr. Ives contends that the Board erred in using out-of-court statements in lieu of conducting its own evidentiary hearing. Dr. Kauffman's testimony and report were likewise tainted by his consideration of the Peer Review Transcript to render an expert medical opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   The Peer Review Transcript contains testimony given by doctors, nurses, and other medical staff about the surgery in question and their interpretations of the events that transpired. The Bureau offered the transcript into evidence for the purpose of establishing what happened in the operating room so that Dr. Kauffman could opine about whether Dr. Ives' conduct of the surgery fell below the accepted standard of care. The parties acknowledge that the transcript is hearsay, which \"is a statement that '(1) the declarant does not make while testifying at the current trial or hearing; and (2) a party offers in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted in the statement.' \"\n   <em>\n    Ray v.

These strictures on the use of unobjected to hearsay are known as the \"\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   rule.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   Conceding that the Peer Review Transcript is hearsay, the Board argues that it can be given probative value in an administrative hearing in accordance with the\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   rule. We disagree. Dr. Ives specifically objected to the admission of the Peer Review Transcript on grounds of hearsay. The\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   rule is inapplicable because it applies only where hearsay evidence has been admitted without objection. It has no application where, as here, hearsay evidence has been admitted over the objection of a party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   The Board held, in the alternative, that the Peer Review Transcript was admissible under the \" 'Former Testimony' exception to the hearsay rule at [Pennsylvania Rule of Evidence] 804(b)(1).\" Board Adjudication at 8. Rule 804(b)(1) states, in relevant part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-101\">\n   The following are not excluded by the rule against hearsay\n   <em>\n    if the declarant is unavailable as a witness\n   </em>\n   :\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   (1)\n   <em>\n    Former Testimony.\n   </em>\n   Testimony that:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-103\">\n   (A) was given as a witness at a trial, hearing, or lawful deposition, whether given during the current proceeding or a different one; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-104\">\n   (B) is now offered against a party who had--or, in a civil case, whose predecessor in interest had--an opportunity and similar motive to develop it by direct, cross-, or redirect examination.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   PA.

The former testimony exception applies when the declarant is unavailable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Board\n   acknowledged this limitation in its adjudication but dismissed the \"unavailability of a declarant\" requirement as serving \"no useful purpose in an administrative proceeding where the objective is to adjudicate issues in an expeditious manner.\" Board Adjudication at 9, n.13. The lapse of six years between the incident and the Board's adjudication belies this rationalization.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-106\">\n   The record offers no support for the position that any of the witnesses who appeared in the peer review hearing were unavailable to testify at the Board hearing or to provide a deposition. We reject the Board's contention that the Peer Review Transcript is admissible under Pennsylvania Rule of Evidence 804(b)(1) ; the \"unavailability of a declarant\" is essential to this hearsay exception and not optional, as the Board believed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-107\">\n   Likewise, the Peer Review Transcript was not admissible as a business record of Ephrata Community Hospital. Section 6108(b) of the Uniform Business Records as Evidence Act states as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   (b) General rule.\n   <strong>\n    --\n   </strong>\n   A record of an act, condition or event shall, insofar as relevant, be competent evidence\n   <em>\n    if the custodian or other qualified witness testifies to its identity and the mode of its preparation,\n   </em>\n   and if it was made in the regular course of business at or near the time of the act, condition or event, and if, in the opinion of the tribunal, the sources of information, method and time of preparation were such as to justify its admission.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-109\">\n   42 Pa.

Even so, an authenticating witness was needed in order to have the transcript admitted. Connolly, who obtained the transcript by subpoena, lacked any knowledge about the preparation or subsequent maintenance of the transcript. For this reason alone, the Peer Review Transcript was not admissible as a business record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-111\">\n   Finally, the Board argues that the Peer Review Transcript was an admissible hospital medical record. The Judicial Code states, in relevant part, as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   <em>\n    Medical charts or records\n   </em>\n   of any health care facility licensed under the laws of this Commonwealth ... may be proved as to foundation, identity and authenticity\n   without any preliminary testimony, by use of legible and durable copies,\n   <em>\n    certified in the manner provided in this subchapter by the employee of the health care facility charged with the responsibility of being custodian of the originals thereof\n   </em>\n   .\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   42 Pa.

Because the Peer Review Transcript is not authenticated or certified, it does not pass the threshold for having a document admitted under 42 Pa. C.S. \u00a7 6151.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   The Peer Review Transcript is hearsay, and it was not admissible by reason of the\n   <em>\n    Walker\n   </em>\n   rule or under any recognized exception to the hearsay rule. Nor was it properly authenticated. For these reasons, the Board erred in admitting the Peer Review Transcript into evidence to prove what happened in the operating room.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   <strong>\n    II.\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-116\">\n   Dr. Ives challenges the admissibility of Dr. Kauffman's testimony and opinion. Dr. Kauffman did not base his opinion strictly on Patient's medical records but also upon the Peer Review Transcript. Dr. Ives argues that Dr. Kauffman's reliance on this inadmissible hearsay rendered his opinion incompetent.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Board responds that experts may rely upon information that is not admitted into evidence to develop their expert opinion. Accordingly, it contends that Dr. Kauffman could rely on the Peer Review Transcript even if it was not properly admitted into evidence at the administrative hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   As a general rule, experts may rely upon reports not admitted into evidence to render an expert opinion. In adopting this principle, our Supreme Court explained:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   In Pennsylvania, our cases have heretofore ruled that an expert may not state a conclusion which is based on evidence not in the record....
