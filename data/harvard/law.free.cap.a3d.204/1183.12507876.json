On appeal, the defendant claims that there was insufficient evidence that he intended to commit sexual assault by force at the time he entered the victim's home.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   He also claims that the prosecutor's closing argument was improper and (1) deprived him of his right to be heard by counsel during final argument, (2) deprived him of the right to a fair trial, and (3) entitled him to a new trial on the charge of home invasion. We disagree and, therefore, affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The jury reasonably could have found the following facts on the basis of the evidence presented at trial. The victim was ten years old on October 15, 2014, when the defendant entered her first floor apartment in a three-family house in Meriden at approximately 3:40 a.m. At that time, the victim, her mother, her mother's boyfriend, and the victim's younger siblings and stepsiblings were asleep in their respective bedrooms.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   front door, a living room window, and the victim's bedroom window faced the front of the house above the porch that ran across the front of the house. The victim's brother had a bedroom in the rear of the apartment with a window above a hatchway that the defendant could have used to enter the apartment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Earlier, at approximately 8 p.m., the victim had fallen asleep in her bed in the room that she shared with her stepsisters. The victim awoke shortly before 3:45 a.m. when she felt someone touch her lower back. She saw a black man with short dreadlocks leaning over her. She did not know him, asked him who he was, and what he was doing there. The defendant did not answer her but asked her how old she was. She stated that she was eight years old, hoping that he would leave her alone. The defendant touched the victim's buttocks beneath her shorts and underwear. The victim pushed herself against the wall to stop him. The defendant took hold of the victim's ankles and put one over each of his shoulders and told her that \"this wouldn't hurt ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The defendant pulled the victim's shorts and underwear down to her knees and put a pillow over her face. He pulled down his own pants, and rubbed and licked the victim's vagina before penetrating it with his penis. The victim tried to get away from the defendant, but she could not free herself from his grip. When the defendant finished, he pulled up the victim's underwear and shorts and threatened to kill her if she told anyone what he had done. He covered her with a blanket and told her to go to sleep. The defendant walked out of the victim's bedroom and partially closed the door. The victim watched him walk through the kitchen toward her brother's bedroom. The window in her brother's room was wide open. No one else in the house was aware of the defendant's presence. The victim's sisters remained asleep, and her brother heard nothing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The victim's mother had awakened at approximately 3:20 a.m., gone into the kitchen to get a bottle to feed her infant, and returned to her bedroom. She saw no one in the apartment at that time. Later, when the victim's mother went back to the kitchen, she saw the victim standing at her bedroom door. The victim, shaking with fright, ran into the kitchen and stated that there was a \"black guy\" in her room. When the victim and her mother entered the victim's bedroom, they saw the defendant peering in the window from the front porch. The victim's mother had never seen the man before. He had dark skin and a braid hanging out of his hoodie. The defendant ran toward the back of the house. The victim's mother tried to pursue him, but she could not keep up with him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The victim told her mother what the defendant had done to her. When the victim went to the bathroom, she saw a clear, wet substance on her vagina and asked her mother if she could wash. The victim's mother, who was medically trained, recognized the presence of semen in her daughter's underwear. She instructed the victim not to wipe off anything. The police were summoned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The victim was taken by ambulance to Midstate Medical Center in Meriden, but because Midstate Medical Center does not perform rape kits on children, she was transported to Yale-New Haven Hospital where Deborah Jane Gallagher, a nurse, administered a rape kit. Gallagher used swabs to obtain DNA samples from the victim's vagina and fourchette, which was torn. Gallagher also took a sample of the victim's blood that would be used to compare the victim's DNA with the DNA collected on the swabs. At the conclusion of the examination, the victim went to the Department of Children and Families' child sexual abuse clinic on Long Wharf Drive in New Haven, where she was interviewed. During the forensic interview, the victim described the\n   perpetrator as having a scratch on his left cheek, clean shaven, and approximately forty years old. The defendant was twenty-three years old and had a full beard and mustache when he was arrested two days later.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The police searched the victim's apartment, focusing their attention on her bed and two windows in her brother's room. They were able to lift fingerprints from the windows, but some of the fingerprints were insufficiently defined to be evaluated. Other fingerprints did not match the defendant's or those of anyone in the police database.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   The police identified the defendant, an African-American man with short dreadlocks, as a suspect and arrested him in Waterbury on October 17, 2014. At the time of the defendant's arrest, the police obtained a sample of the defendant's DNA from the inside of his cheek.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Daniel T. Renstrom, a DNA analyst at the state forensics laboratory, testified about his analysis of the DNA samples that were sent to the laboratory. He developed profiles of the victim's and the defendant's DNA, and a profile of the DNA on the swabs of the victim's vagina and fourchette. Renstrom divided the DNA samples from the victim's vagina and fourchette into two components, an epithelial or nonsperm-rich fraction and a sperm-rich fraction. He compared the two fractions to DNA profiles of the victim and the defendant. The swab of the victim's fourchette contained a mixture of DNA, that is, DNA from more than one contributor. Renstrom determined that the victim was the source of the epithelial fraction from the DNA sample from her fourchette, but he could not identify the other contributor due to\n   an insufficient amount of DNA. Pursuant to the laboratory's policy, Renstrom eliminated the defendant as a DNA contributor to the DNA mixture from the victim's fourchette.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The DNA profile obtained from the swab of the victim's vagina also produced a mixed DNA profile. The swab contained both saliva and spermatozoa. The victim was a contributor to the epithelial fraction. The sperm-rich fraction contained a mixture of DNA from both the victim and the defendant.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The number of people who have the DNA profile that was identified as the defendant's is approximately one in 52 million in the African-American population, one in 37 million in the Hispanic population, and one in 66 million in the Caucasian population.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The defendant was charged in a long form information with home invasion in\n   violation of \u00a7 53a-100aa(a)(1), three counts of sexual assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-70(a)(2), and one count of risk of injury to a child in violation of \u00a7 53-21(a)(2). On December 15, 2016, a jury returned a verdict of guilty on all counts charged. Thereafter, the defendant filed a motion for a judgment of acquittal as to his conviction of home invasion\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   and a motion for a new trial on the\n   ground of prosecutorial impropriety.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court denied both motions. On February 24, 2017, the court sentenced the defendant to an effective term of sixty-five years imprisonment. The defendant appealed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The defendant first claims that the state failed to present sufficient evidence for the jury to find that he intended to commit a sexual assault by force at the time he entered the victim's home, as was required to convict him of home invasion. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The state alleged in count one of the long form information that on or about October 15, 2014, at approximately 3:41 a.m., the defendant \"unlawfully entered a dwelling, while a person other than a participant in the crime (to wit: [the victim] ) was actually present in such dwelling, with intent to commit a crime therein (to wit: Sexual Assault in the First Degree [\u00a7] 53a-70[a][1] ),\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   and, in the course of committing the offense: he committed a felony against the person of another person other than a participant in the crime who was actually present in such dwelling, said conduct being in violation of [\u00a7]\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   53a-100aa(a)(1) of the Connecticut General Statutes.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   (Footnote added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \"In reviewing a sufficiency of the evidence claim, we apply a two-part test.

The evidence that permitted such an inference included, among other things, the location of the victim's bedroom window above the porch; the failure of the victim's mother to see the defendant in the dwelling when she went to the kitchen at 3:20 a.m.; the defendant's having gone to the victim's bedroom and awakened her; the defendant's having asked the victim her age and telling her that \"this wouldn't hurt\"; the defendant's having put a pillow over her face and having sexually assaulted her; the defendant's having threatened to kill the victim if she told anyone what he had done; his leaving the scene of the assault immediately by walking through the kitchen and exiting the window in the brother's bedroom; the lack of evidence of another crime having been committed in the dwelling; and the victim's viewing the defendant peering into her bedroom window after he exited the dwelling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The foregoing, along with the evidence in its entirety, permitted the jury reasonably to conclude that the defendant entered the apartment to sexually assault the victim by force. The jury reasonably could have inferred that the defendant had been observing the dwelling and knew the layout of the apartment, knew the family's sleeping habits, and had been watching the victim through her bedroom window. The defendant acknowledges that there was evidence that he entered the victim's dwelling through her brother's bedroom window. The defendant knew how to get from the brother's room to the victim's bedroom and went directly to the victim, not one of the sisters. He asked her age and told her that \"this wouldn't hurt ....\" He was in the apartment for a short period of time, disturbed no one but the\n   victim, committed no other crime, and immediately left after sexually assaulting the victim. \"Common experience tells us that an unlawful entry into a dwelling at night is not without purpose. Nor are people accustomed to enter homes of strangers through a window for innocent purposes.\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Zayas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"689191\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/195/611/#p617\">\n    195 Conn. 611\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 617,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=490%20A.2d%2068\">\n    490 A.2d 68\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1985).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The jury reasonably could have inferred that the manner in which the defendant entered the victim's dwelling and carried out his sexual assault of her was circumstantial evidence that, when he entered the dwelling, he had the intent to commit a sexual assault. The single-mindedness with which the defendant entered the dwelling, proceeded to the victim's bedroom, and sexually assaulted her against her will is compelling evidence of this intent. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Barnes\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4032298\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/99/203/#p212\">\n    99 Conn.

This argument is predicated on the prosecutor's summation that did not marshal evidence demonstrating the defendant's intent when he entered the dwelling. The defendant has provided no legal support for the singular proposition that the prosecutor was required to marshal the evidence in any particular manner, and we are unaware of any Connecticut law requiring the state to marshal its evidence as the defendant suggests. Moreover, it is well known, as the jury was instructed in the present case, that the arguments of counsel are not evidence and that it is the jury's recollection of the evidence that is controlling.

We first outline the final arguments of both the prosecutor and defense counsel to provide a context in which to consider the defendant's claims. The prosecutor began the first portion of her summation by thanking the jurors for their service and then stated that she intended \"to highlight\" some of the evidence, but that the jury's recollection of the facts was what counted. She also stated that she was going to \"highlight some points of law,\" but that the judge was going to instruct the jury on the law and \"his word goes ....\" She then summarized the evidence concerning the events that occurred in the victim's home during the night of October 15, 2014. Given those facts, she stated that the state charged the defendant with home invasion, three counts of sexual assault in the first degree, and risk of injury to a child. The prosecutor then stated: \"The judge will give you the exact definition of these crimes at much more length than I will, and you will actually get the copy of his instructions to take with you in the jury room, but I'd like to summarize them briefly for you.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   The prosecutor read the first count of the long form information charging the defendant with home invasion. She stated thereafter that the \"statute is very wordy, but basically, it means that the defendant had to unlawfully enter the dwelling while a person was inside with the intent to commit a sexual assault and commit a felony while inside against another person ....\" The prosecutor then addressed each of the three counts of sexual assault and risk of injury to a child with which the defendant was charged. She reminded the jury that the \"judge, again, will have more detailed\n   instructions and you will have them in the jury room with you ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   She concluded the first portion of her final argument by stating that the jury was going to hear from the defendant, particularly about fingerprints and mistakes made by the laboratory and the police, and that the victim and the victim's mother were unable to identify the perpetrator of the crimes from photographs or in court. Finally, she stated that you \"will hear all of these things and more from the defense, but while you are listening to their argument, there are three letters you will not be able to forget. There are three letters you will not be able to get out of your head. Those letters are DNA.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Counsel for the defendant then presented his closing argument. He made a few general remarks and stated that it was the jury's recollection of the facts, not his, that mattered. He stated that he only had one chance to address the jury. He acknowledged the seriousness of the facts, and\n   that the jury surely wanted justice for the victim and \"to believe that the Meriden police got the right man.\" He also reminded the jurors that they had acknowledged during voir dire that \"the verdict would have to be not guilty\" if the state had not proved the case beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   He argued that the \"majority of evidence in this case contradicts a piece of evidence that implicates the defendant.\" He asked the jury to consider three things: how much contradictory evidence there was, whether the evidence against the defendant was corroborated, and whether the evidence pointing the finger at the defendant was solid or problematic. He noted that there was no courtroom identification of the perpetrator and that the victim's description of the perpetrator did not \"line up\" with the defendant's appearance in four ways: the victim testified that the perpetrator had no facial\n   hair, had a scar on his cheek, was dark-skinned, and was forty years old. He pointed out that when the defendant was arrested, he had a full beard and was twenty-three years old. A photograph of the defendant taken at the time of his arrest depicts no scar and indicates that he is not dark-skinned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   With respect to fingerprints on the window in the brother's room, counsel for the defendant argued that the victim saw the perpetrator go back to her brother's room, and her mother discovered the window wide open. \"It seems logical given the bulkhead or Bilco door that that's the window that the perpetrator went into. It's also logical that if you're pushing the window up, you might leave some prints there.... Could you imagine if his prints were found on that window, what we'd be looking at? ... But those prints, he's excluded from leaving those prints; they're not his.\" \"The state wants you to believe that maybe the kids were out there playing. They're not kids' prints. You heard the experts testify about that.\n   <em>\n    A hundred years?\n   </em>\n   The windows were there forever? I mean, come on, let's be serious.\" (Emphasis added.) He stated that the lack of evidence in terms of fingerprints was important.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   Defense counsel also asked what corroborated the DNA evidence in the case and answered his own question, \"[n]othing.\" He argued that there was no evidence that the sperm slide or the victim's panties or her sheets were tested, as those items were not sent to the laboratory. He urged the jury to listen to the judge's instructions that it was not the defendant's burden to put on evidence. Nonetheless, the defendant had called the detectives in the case to testify. The state called only the victim, her mother, the forensic interviewer, the nurse and doctor, and the laboratory scientists to testify.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   Defense counsel further addressed the DNA evidence, arguing why it was problematic. In the profile\n   developed from one swab source, the defendant was eliminated as a contributor, but he was a contributor in a profile from another source. Defense counsel noted the inconsistent number of swabs. \"So, the one [source] that has the most seminal fluid, the one that results in the smear with the sperm, he's eliminated from. That's problematic. This is not a reliable result. If a result is unreliable, then statistics mean nothing.\" Defense counsel also talked about mistakes the police made in recording and storing the fingerprints, and argued that Gallagher's testimony about the number of swabs in a rape kit was not consistent with the number of swabs sent to the laboratory. He concluded that the lack of evidence did not permit the jury to accept the reliability of the DNA evidence. He urged the jury not to decide the case on \"blind faith ....\"\n   On rebuttal, the prosecutor argued that the state was not asking the jury to decide the case on blind faith, but on science. She pointed out that the defendant did not leave his fingerprints on the window, but that he left \"evidence from another part of his body,\" which \"resulted in a DNA profile that only one in 52 million people in the African-American community have.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   With respect to fingerprints, she stated that they \"tell you nothing.\" There were fingerprints on the window, but \"[w]e don't know where the prints came from or how long they've been there or if they've been there for a hundred years. The prints tell us nothing and show you nothing and prove nothing.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The prosecutor restated the victim's testimony regarding the incident on October 15, 2014. She reviewed the victim's description of the perpetrator and displayed photographs of the defendant that were in evidence. She also reviewed the testimony of the victim's mother. She recounted the testimony of Gallagher\n   and Gunjan Tiyyagura, an emergency department physician who described shining a BlueMax light on the victim's vagina that revealed the presence of semen. She recounted in summary the testimony regarding the forensic interview of the victim, and gave a more detailed recitation of the testimony of the laboratory scientists regarding the swabs and the DNA profiles produced from them. She mentioned that Renstrom developed known DNA profiles of both the victim and the defendant, and compared them with the profile obtained from the swab of the victim's vagina. The DNA of both the victim and the defendant were present in that profile. She stated that Renstrom \"attached a statistic to the [number] of times you would see that profile in a number of people. He told you that you would see the DNA profile of the defendant once in 52 million people in the African-American community. Think about that, ladies and gentlemen. You hear evidence that the whole state of Connecticut is 3.5 million people. If we filled the entire state of Connecticut with 3.5 million African-Americans, 52 million African-Americans would be the population of Connecticut times fourteen. So, if we placed 3.5 million African-Americans in Connecticut and stacked thirteen more states the size of Connecticut on top of that full of African-Americans, we would still only see that profile one time. That, ladies and gentlemen, is proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   We now address the defendant's claims of prosecutorial impropriety.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   The defendant's first claim of prosecutorial misconduct is that the prosecutor violated his constitutional right to be heard by counsel during oral argument by reserving the substantive discussion of the evidence for her rebuttal. He argues that, without knowing how the\n   state intended to marshal the evidence, his counsel could not effectively rebut the state's argument and, therefore, he lost his \"last clear chance to persuade the [jury] that there may be reasonable doubt of [his] guilt,\" quoting\n   <em>\n    Herring\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    New York\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9689\" index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/422/853/#p862\">\n    422 U.S. 853\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 862,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9689\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/422/853/#p862\">\n    95 S.Ct. 2550\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9689\" index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/422/853/#p862\">\n    45 L.Ed.2d 593\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1975).

The present case, however, is not one in which the defendant claims that the court improperly limited his right to argue to the jury. He instead takes issue with the prosecutor's strategy, claiming that because the prosecutor made her substantive argument during rebuttal, defense counsel could not counter the substance of the prosecutor's argument.

Second, the court did not deny defense counsel the opportunity to make a final argument to the jury. Third, defense counsel argued to the jury. Our review of the argument made by defense counsel discloses that he reminded the jury that it was its recollection of the facts that mattered and that he had only one opportunity to address the jury, although the prosecutor had two such opportunities. He ably pointed out the weaknesses in the state's case: the victim and her mother were unable to identify the perpetrator in court or from photographs, the victim's description of the perpetrator was not consistent with his appearance, there was no fingerprint evidence from the window where the perpetrator supposedly entered the dwelling, the DNA evidence was uncorroborated, and the nurse used two swabs to collect DNA from the victim but there were three swabs in the rape kit in the laboratory, among other things. Significantly, defense counsel argued that the DNA evidence was unreliable and that the state should not be entitled to rely on it.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   Contrary to the defendant's argument, defense counsel was able to address the evidentiary issues in the\n   case that formed the basis of both portions of the prosecutor's final argument. Defense counsel's argument with regard to the evidence directly attacked statements the prosecutor made during her summation, to wit: \"[Y]ou're going to hear a lot of things about fingerprints and mistakes by the lab or police with those fingerprints.

That, ladies and gentlemen, is proof beyond a\n   reasonable doubt.\" The defendant notes that Renstrom testified that the population of Connecticut is approximately 3.5 million and that \"the expected frequency of individuals who could be a contributor to the mixture in 1 C-B is approximately one in 52 million in the African-American population, approximately one in 66 million in the Caucasian population, and approximately one in 37 million in the Hispanic population.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   The defendant claims that the prosecutor's argument implicates two errors in probabilistic reasoning. By telling the jury that only one person in Connecticut would be included as a contributor, the prosecutor urged the jury to commit the \" 'uniqueness fallacy,' \"\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   stating that \"it is a fallacy\n   to infer uniqueness from profile frequencies simply because they are smaller than the number of available objects.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   The second error, the defendant argues, is \"the probability of another match error, which conflates the chance that a single, randomly selected person could be included as a contributor with the chance that at least one other member of the population could be included.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant contends that the prosecutor's incorrect reasoning was harmful because even a relatively low percentage chance that someone else could be included as a contributor may have been enough to convince the jury that there was a reasonable doubt as to the defendant's guilt.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   We need not determine whether the defendant's statistical argument is correct. He presented no evidence\n   to support the claim he now raises on appeal, and the record is inadequate to address it. Our review of the record discloses that the prosecutor's argument was predicated on the evidence. On redirect examination, the prosecutor questioned Renstrom about the frequency of the defendant's DNA profile occurring in the African-American population in Connecticut:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-68\">\n   \"[The Prosecutor]: How many people are in the state of Connecticut?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-69\">\n   \"[The Witness]: I'm not sure of the exact population.

We do not agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   During the trial, the state presented testimony from John Cerejo, a detective with the Meriden Police Department, and Steve Burstein, a detective sergeant with the department, regarding the efforts the police made to get fingerprints from the window in the bedroom of the victim's brother. Many of the fingerprints were not sufficiently clear to be used for identification purposes, and none of them matched the defendant's fingerprints. According to Cerejo, the length of time a fingerprint stays on a surface depends on, among other things, whether it is exposed to sun and rain. He testified inconsistently as to how long the fingerprints on the window could have been there. According to Burstein, the window was exposed to the elements, and he did not know how long the fingerprints were on the window. He also testified that he did not know when the house had been built, but estimated, without objection, that it \"probably [was] a hundred years ago or so ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   During her rebuttal, the prosecutor downplayed the importance of fingerprints on the window, arguing, in\n   part, \"[w]e don't know where the prints came from or how long they've been there or if they've been there for a hundred years.\" The defendant claims that the argument was improper because there was no evidence that the fingerprints could have been on the window for anywhere close to one hundred years. We do not find the prosecutor's argument to have been improper. The obvious point of the prosecutor's argument was that there was no evidence as to whose fingerprints were on the window or when they happened to be put there. With a hyperbolic flourish, the prosecutor incorporated the testimony that the house was estimated to be one hundred years old to emphasize that no one knew when or who put fingerprints on the window. Surely, the jury understood the prosecutor's remark as an overstatement. Moreover, counsel for the defendant stated in his closing argument: \"They're not kids' prints. You heard the experts testify about that. A hundred years? The windows were there forever? I mean, come on, let's be serious.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-82\">\n   Whether the prosecutor's one hundred years remark was hyperbole or made in response to the argument of defense counsel, the arguments of both counsel had a basis in the evidence. Most importantly, there was no fingerprint evidence that connected the defendant to the crimes and, therefore, he could not have been prejudiced by the argument. The defendant's claim of prosecutorial impropriety during oral argument therefore fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-83\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-84\">\n   The defendant also claims that he is entitled to a new trial because the prosecutor's allegedly improper rebuttal argument deprived him of the right to closing argument. We do not agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-85\">\n   The defendant's claim is made through the lens of hindsight and is not supported by the record. The defendant expounds on his claim that he did not have a\n   chance to rebut the state's view of the evidence, and that his theory of defense was to challenge the persuasiveness and reliability of the DNA evidence. He asserted\n   that he was denied the right to final argument especially with respect to the prosecutor's rebuttal argument that he was the only person in Connecticut who could be a contributor to the DNA mixture and that defense counsel was not given an opportunity to correct the argument. The defendant claims that this was extraordinarily harmful because juries, lawyers, and judges have a difficult time interpreting probabilistic information. This claim was not raised at trial and, therefore, is not preserved. Moreover, the defendant claims that he did not have the chance to counter the prosecutor's argument in the context of his own theory that there were serious questions about the collection, preservation, and testing of the physical evidence that called Renstrom's testimony into question.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   The defendant's contention that he is entitled to a new trial on the basis of the prosecutor's rebuttal argument is flawed for at least two reasons. If, as he argues on appeal, the prosecutor's argument that he was the only person in Connecticut who could have contributed to the DNA mixture is wrong, defense counsel could have objected to the argument at trial, but did not. Counsel, therefore, must not have thought that it misled the jury. Given the complexity of DNA evidence, an objection must be raised at the time evidence is presented when it can be corrected.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Brett B.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12505704\" index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/200/706/#p573\">\n    186 Conn.

During his final argument, defense counsel made clear to the jury all of the problems in the collection, preservation, and\n   testing of the DNA evidence. The defendant, therefore, was not deprived of his right to final argument and to present his view of the DNA evidence. In fact, defense counsel anticipated and attempted to refute the prosecutor's rebuttal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, the defendant's claim of prosecutorial impropriety during final argument fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   The defendant's final claim is that he is entitled to a new trial on the charge of home invasion because the second portion of the prosecutor's final argument misled the jury on the elements of the crime of home invasion, and that the misstatement was not harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.

He argues that the language misrepresented the law to the jury because it invited the jury to find him guilty even if it did not find beyond a reasonable doubt that he intended to commit a sexual assault by force at the time of entry. The defendant correctly states that prosecutors are not permitted to misstate the law because it invites a conviction unwarranted by the law and facts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Otto\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=305%20Conn.%2051\">\n    305 Conn. at 77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20A.3d%20629\">\n    43 A.3d 629\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"A\n   review of the statements made by the prosecutor, in the context of the entire closing argument, is necessary to address the defendant's challenges.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=43%20A.3d%20629\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Our review of the prosecutor's entire summation discloses the context of the prosecutor's argument to which the defendant takes exception. After thanking the jury for its service, the prosecutor stated that she intended to highlight some of the evidence, but that if the jury had a different recollection of the evidence, its recollection was what counted. She also stated that she would highlight some points of law, but that\n   <em>\n    the trial judge would give the jury instructions on the law and that \"his word goes\n   </em>\n   ....\" (Emphasis added.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-93\">\n   The prosecutor then summarized the victim's testimony and stated that on the basis of \"the horrific facts\" the victim described, the state charged the defendant with five crimes. The prosecutor stated: \"The judge will give you the exact definition of these crimes at much more length than I will, and you will actually get the copy of his instructions to take with you in the jury room, but I'd like to summarize them briefly for you.\" The prosecutor then read the first count of the long form information to the jury. Immediately thereafter, the prosecutor stated: \"That statute is very wordy, but basically, it means that the defendant had to unlawfully enter the dwelling while a person was inside with the intent to commit a sexual assault and commit a felony while inside against another person; and again, this will be described further, but that's the first count of the information.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-94\">\n   When the court instructed the jury, it stated in part: \"You as the jury and I as the judge have separate functions. It's your function to find what the facts are in this case. With respect to the facts, you and you alone are charged with that responsibility. My function is to charge you on the law to be applied to the facts that\n   you find in order to decide this case. With respect to the law, what I say to you is binding on you, and you must follow all of my instructions.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-95\">\n   With respect to the first count of the information, which alleged home invasion, the court instructed the jury that it would have the information in the jury room along with a copy of its charge. The court read the charge of home invasion to the jury and \u00a7 53a-100aa(a)(1). It then stated: \"So, for you to find the defendant guilty of this charge, the state must prove each of the following elements beyond a reasonable doubt: (1) that the defendant knowingly and unlawfully entered a dwelling, (2) that the defendant intended to commit the crime of sexual assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (1) in that dwelling, (3) that when the defendant entered the dwelling, a person other than a participant in the crime, namely [the victim], was actually present in the dwelling, and (4) that in the course of committing the home invasion, the defendant committed a felony against the person of another person other than a participant in the crime who was actually present in the dwelling.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-96\">\n   The court elaborated on all of the elements of the crime of home invasion: \"The second element that the state must prove\n   beyond a reasonable doubt is that the defendant intended to commit the crime of sexual assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-70 (a) (1) in the dwelling. Our statutes provide that a person acts intentionally with respect to a result when his conscious objective is to cause such result. What a person's intent has been is very largely a matter of inference. No witness can be expected to come here and testify that he looked into another person's mind and saw therein a certain intention. A jury may determine what a person's intention was at any given time by determining what that person's conduct was and what the circumstances were surrounding that conduct,\n   and from those things infer what his intention was. An intent may be inferred from circumstantial evidence, provided the inference is a reasonable one and warranted by facts that you find proven. To draw such an inference is not only the privilege but also the proper function of a jury, provided of course, that the inference drawn complies with the standards for inference set forth in my instruction on circumstantial evidence.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-97\">\n   The trial court also instructed the jury on the elements of sexual assault in the first degree by the use of force, to wit: \"The necessary intent to commit a crime must be an intent to commit either a felony or a misdemeanor in addition to the unlawful entering of the dwelling. In this case, the state claims that the defendant committed the crime of sexual assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-70(a)(1).... That section provides ... [a] person is guilty of sexual assault in the first degree when such person compels another person to engage in sexual intercourse by the use of force against such other person. For a person to intend to commit the crime of sexual assault in the first degree in violation of \u00a7 53a-70(a)(1)... he must intend to (1) compel another person to engage in sexual intercourse, and (2) to accomplish the sexual intercourse by the use of force against the other person. With respect to this element, the state must first prove beyond a reasonable doubt that when the defendant entered the dwelling in question, he intended to compel another person to engage in sexual intercourse. Sexual intercourse means vaginal intercourse or cunnilingus between persons regardless of sex.... The state must additionally prove beyond a reasonable doubt that when the defendant entered the dwelling, he intended to accomplish the sexual intercourse by the use of force against ... the other person.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   The defendant does not claim that the court's instructions were improper. \"Barring contrary evidence ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   we must presume that juries follow the instructions given them by the trial judge.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Morton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1047936\" index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/59/529/#p537\">\n    59 Conn.

The prosecutor did not so much misstate the law as give an incomplete description of the charge against the defendant. The prosecutor, however, more than once told the jurors that the court would instruct them on the law and that the court's instructions were what counted.

The defendant contended that there was no evidence to suggest or from which to infer that the perpetrator knew who lived in the home before he entered. Moreover, there is no evidence to suggest how long the perpetrator was in the victim's home or what he did in the home prior to awakening the victim.
