BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   [\u00b62] The following facts, including all justifiable inferences, are drawn from the trial record as viewed in the light most favorable to the jury verdict.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Hansen v. Sunday River Skiway Corp.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11587816\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/726/220/\">\n    1999 ME 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 5,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11587816\" index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/726/220/\">\n    726 A.2d 220\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   [\u00b63] In July 2013, Nason fractured the scaphoid bone of his right wrist while working. Nason was referred to Pruchnic, a hand surgeon employed at Eastern Maine Medical Center, who determined that surgical intervention was required for proper healing. Pruchnic performed a surgical implantation of a compression screw\n   in Nason's scaphoid bone in September 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   [\u00b64] Throughout the next few months, Pruchnic completed several imaging studies on Nason's wrist, but failed to discover any potential problems. Believing Nason's wrist to be healing properly, Pruchnic had Nason begin physical therapy, where he experienced pain and a distinct clicking feeling in his wrist. Eventually, Pruchnic realized that the screw he had placed in Nason's wrist was protruding from the scaphoid bone and into the surrounding cartilage.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   [\u00b65] Due to Nason's extended absence from work, his workers' compensation agent scheduled him to be examined by another surgeon. Upon examining Nason, the surgeon immediately recognized that the screw was protruding from Nason's scaphoid bone and performed surgery to remove the screw, during which the surgeon observed extensive damage to the cartilage of Nason's right wrist. The surgeon performed a second surgery in an attempt to clean up as much damage as possible. Despite these efforts, Nason continued to experience pain in his right wrist, and several injections proved ineffective. Ultimately, the surgeon completed a third surgery on Nason, removing his scaphoid bone along with two other bones.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   [\u00b66] Nason brought an action against Pruchnic and Eastern Maine Medical Center, alleging negligence in Pruchnic's attempted surgical repair of his scaphoid bone, leaving him with permanent pain and impairment of his wrist. The jury unanimously found Pruchnic and Eastern Maine Medical Center negligent and awarded damages of $ 2,000,000.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pruchnic moved for a new trial, or in the alternative, remittitur, on the ground that the jury verdict was excessive. The Superior Court denied Pruchnic's motion. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   II. DISCUSSION\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   [\u00b67] Pruchnic argues that he was entitled to a new trial, or in the alternative, remittitur, on the ground that the jury awarded excessive damages. Pruchnic also argues that the trial court erred by giving a jury instruction pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Lovely v. Allstate Ins. Co.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7880659\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/658/1091/\">\n    658 A.2d 1091\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Me. 1995), admitting only redacted portions of radiology reports, and instructing the jury to disregard mentions of workers' compensation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   A. Excessive Damages\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   [\u00b68] The assessment of damages \"is the responsibility of the jury and generally its judgment must stand. However, the trial court may intervene to set aside an excessive verdict if the moving party is able to demonstrate that the jury acted under some bias, prejudice, or improper influence, or has made some mistake of fact or law.\"\n   <em>\n    Seabury-Peterson v. Jhamb\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7339688\" index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/15/746/\">\n    2011 ME 35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 18,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7339688\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/15/746/\">\n    15 A.3d 746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (alteration and citation omitted) (quotation marks omitted). Because the trial court has the opportunity to observe the trial, \"it is in a far better position than an appellate court to determine whether the damages are rationally supported by the evidence and whether the jury had an improper motive for awarding excessive damages.\"\n   <em>\n    Id.\n   </em>\n   \u00b6 19. Accordingly, we review a trial court's refusal to grant a new trial or remittitur based on an allegedly excessive jury verdict for a clear and manifest abuse of discretion.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Marston v. Newavom\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7365411\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/629/587/#p593\">\n    629 A.2d 587\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 593 (Me. 1993).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   [\u00b69] In reviewing a claim that a jury verdict is excessive, the trial court\n   first \"examines the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict\" to determine if the verdict bears a rational relationship to the evidence.\n   <em>\n    Seabury-Peterson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7339688\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/15/746/\">\n    2011 ME 35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 19,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7339688\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/15/746/\">\n    15 A.3d 746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . A rational relationship exists if there is any competent evidence in the record to support the verdict.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bourette v. Dresser Indus., Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7914451\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/481/170/#p174\">\n    481 A.2d 170\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 174 (Me. 1984). If no rational relationship exists between the evidence in the record and the damages award, then the trial court must evaluate the jury's basis for awarding the allegedly excessive damages.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Seabury-Peterson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7339688\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/15/746/\">\n    2011 ME 35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , \u00b6 19,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7339688\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/15/746/\">\n    15 A.3d 746\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If an excessive award stems from an improper basis, \"such as passion or prejudice, a new trial is the appropriate remedy.\"\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7339688\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/15/746/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   However, when the excessive award stems from a good faith mistake, remittitur to the maximum amount that rationally could be found by a jury is the appropriate remedy.\n   <em>\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7339688\" index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/15/746/\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   [\u00b610] Contrary to Pruchnic's contentions, there is competent evidence in the record to support the trial court's determination that there was a rational relationship between that evidence and the jury's damage award. Due to Pruchnic's negligence, three bones were removed from Nason's wrist, leaving him permanently and significantly impaired. This impairment has caused demonstrated changes in Nason's daily life and activities. Nason has further experienced emotional distress based on a fear of unemployability should he lose his job and a reduced self-worth due to his inability to engage in activities as he did before the surgery performed by Pruchnic. Moreover, because of the impairment, Nason was required to take a new position at work, resulting in the loss of significant overtime wages.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   [\u00b611] Because the court could reasonably determine that the evidence bears a rational relationship to the jury's award of $ 2,000,000, it was not a clear and manifest abuse of discretion for the court to deny Pruchnic's motion for a new trial, or in the alternative, remittitur.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   We may not intervene merely because of the amount of the award or because another jury may have awarded less.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Wallace v.

This is particularly true where, as here, the jury was given a general verdict form, making it impossible to specifically determine the components of damages assessed by the jury that led to the overall verdict.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Withers v.

The\n   <em>\n    Lovely\n   </em>\n   Jury Instruction\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   [\u00b612] Pruchnic next contends that it was error for the trial court to give a jury instruction pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Lovely v.

A trial court must give the jury instructions\n   that are generated by the evidence presented in the case.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Bratton v.

In his opening statement, Pruchnic pointed out that \"there were other abnormalities in [Nason's] wrist which have nothing to do with the screw.\" Pruchnic's expert testified that the extent of injury to Nason's wrist could be due to wear and tear from an active life, degenerative changes, and the potential trauma from having multiple surgeries. On cross-examination of the surgeon who removed the screw from Nason's wrist, Pruchnic developed testimony that the damage to Nason's wrist could have been due to early arthritis or trauma from the surgery. Finally, during closing arguments Pruchnic stated that \"there's other things going on in Mr. Nason's hand in different areas of the wrist,\" and that there was \"evidence of cysts and a degenerative process even before the screw [was] placed.\" The evidence and arguments presented by Pruchnic raised the issue of a preexisting or subsequent injury causing at least some portion of Nason's problems.\n   <em>\n    See\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7880659\" index=\"27\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a2d/658/1091/\">\n     id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n   </em>\n   Thus, it was not error for the court to instruct the jury pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Lovely\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   C. Radiology Reports\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   [\u00b615] Pruchnic also argues that he was prejudiced by the trial court's redaction of several radiology reports in which the radiologists offered opinions as to potential causes of Nason's wrist problems based on their review of Nason's imaging studies. Pruchnic asserts that the records were admissible in their entirety pursuant to 16 M.R.S. \u00a7 357 (2018), or, alternatively, as facts forming the basis of an expert's opinion and statements made for medical diagnosis and treatment.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   M.R.

However, Pruchnic failed to designate an expert to testify on the issue, and despite objecting to the court's redaction of the medical records, failed to provide an argument as to why the evidence was relevant and admissible or an offer of proof to preserve his objection.\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    M.R.
