Parnoff, to the summary judgments rendered by the trial court in favor of the defendants in this action. In this appeal, the plaintiff appeals from the summary judgments rendered by the trial court in favor of the defendants Aquarion Water Company of Connecticut (Aquarion) and its employees, Beverly A. Doyle, David Lathlean, and Kyle Lavin.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff claims that the trial court erred by rendering summary judgment in\n   favor of the defendants as to his (1) claims of trespass, (2) claims of negligent infliction of emotional distress, (3) claims of invasion of privacy, (4) claims of intentional infliction of emotional distress, and (5) claim under the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), General Statutes \u00a7 42-110b (a). For the reasons set forth in this opinion, we disagree with the plaintiff and affirm the judgments of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   In July, 2014, the plaintiff commenced the present action against the defendants, alleging in his twenty-five count revised complaint filed on May 24, 2016, various claims arising from a July 11, 2011 incident that took place on his property at 3392 Huntington Road, Stratford, and the adjacent lot he owned. Therein, he alleged, inter alia, that the defendants trespassed onto his property beyond any easement rights of Aquarion and did so against his express orders or consent. He alleged that Lavin \"ran up to [the plaintiff] shouting 'you're stealing water' and put his camera in [the plaintiff's] face.\" The plaintiff alleged that he denied stealing any water and instructed the defendants to \"immediately remove their three vehicles from [his property] and leave.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Furthermore, the plaintiff alleged that both he and Lathlean called the Stratford Police Department.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   After doing so, the plaintiff alleged that Police \"[O]fficer [Glynn] McGlynn was dispatched by the Stratford Police Department and told of both calls.\" Upon arrival, the plaintiff asserted, inter alia, that McGlynn \"spoke at length with the Aquarion employees\" and asked the plaintiff to \"leave because McGlynn was conducting an investigation.\" The plaintiff alleged that McGlynn\n   eventually arrested him. He averred that McGlynn transported him to a holding cell at the Stratford Police Department, allowing the defendants to trespass further on his property. Moreover, he asserted that the defendants \"exhort[ed] public officials to take further baseless action to humiliate and embarrass\" him and publicly accused him of theft. In his complaint, the plaintiff included counts against each of the four defendants for trespass (counts one through four), negligent infliction of emotional distress (counts five through eight), intentional infliction of emotional distress (counts nine through twelve), and invasion of privacy (counts thirteen through sixteen). He also included a count\n   against Aquarion alleging a violation under CUTPA (count seventeen).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On July 13, 2016, the defendants filed an answer with eleven special defenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendants alleged that the plaintiff's trespass claims in counts one through four were barred because Doyle, Lathlean, and Lavin's entry, presence, and activities on the property were expressly permitted by easements, reservations, and exceptions held by Aquarion. As to counts five through eight, the defendants argued that the plaintiff's claims were barred by the relevant statute of limitations. As to all the counts, the defendants alleged the plaintiff's claims were barred in whole or in part by the plaintiff's waiver because he had agreed, inter alia, to permit\n   Aquarion to \"inspect, maintain and repair hydrants\"; by the doctrines of absolute and qualified immunity; by the doctrine of privilege with consent; by the doctrine of privilege; by the doctrine of consent or license; by the plaintiff's contributory negligence; and because the defendants' actions were authorized and/or permitted by federal and state laws, rules and regulations, including those promulgated and approved by the Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority (PURA) and the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. As to the plaintiff's claims in equity, the defendants alleged that the claims were barred in whole or in part by the doctrine of unclean hands.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On August 1, 2016, the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment as to all of the counts directed against them. As to the trespass allegations in counts one through four, the defendants argued that, in addition to their rights pursuant to an easement on the plaintiff's property, they also had a tariff from PURA to access the plaintiff's property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In regard to counts five through twelve and seventeen, which included the claims of negligent infliction of emotional distress, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and a violation of CUTPA, the defendants argued that the counts were barred by absolute immunity for all statements made in relation to the judicial action brought against the plaintiff and any statements made to the Statewide\n   Grievance Committee, which began an investigation of the plaintiff, a member of the Connecticut bar, related to the incident on July 11, 2011. They also argued that qualified immunity barred the counts for all communications made to the police or\n   other investigative officers on July 11, 2011, the day before criminal charges arising from the July 11, 2011 incident were filed against the plaintiff.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   As to counts five through eight, in which the plaintiff raised claims of negligent infliction of emotional distress, the defendants argued they were time barred under the applicable statute of limitations. With respect to counts nine through twelve, in which the plaintiff raised claims of intentional infliction of emotional distress, the defendants argued that the counts were deficient because the defendants' conduct could not be regarded as extreme or outrageous. Furthermore, with respect to counts thirteen through sixteen, the defendants argued that the pleadings were facially deficient as to the plaintiff's invasion of privacy by unreasonable intrusion upon seclusion claims because the conduct alleged by the plaintiff cannot be regarded as highly offensive. Lastly, as to count seventeen, Aquarion alleged that the plaintiff failed to establish a CUTPA violation because he did not suffer an ascertainable loss as required under the act, a trespass or police report does not form a business relationship to satisfy the commercial transaction requirement, and the conduct complained of \"does not rise to the required level of a deceptive practice or violation\" under the act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In support of their motion, the defendants filed a memorandum of law and thirty-two exhibits.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   These\n   exhibits demonstrate that on the morning of July 11, 2011, the defendants were servicing one of Aquarion's hydrants, which was located on the plaintiff's property. When Lavin and Lathean first located the hydrant, they found that it was missing a cap and was leaking, and that the ground was wet. They also observed a red garden hose on the ground next to the hydrant, which they traced to a goat pen located next to a pond. Additionally, they observed other hoses located under leaves that appeared to lead to the goat pen, where two goats resided. These hoses branched off from a red hose that was located on the fencing of the goat pen. Lathlean and Lavin began searching for the missing hydrant cap in the immediate vicinity of the hydrant and walked into an open canopy tent located about ten feet from the hydrant, where they spotted the missing hydrant cap on the floor of the plaintiff's tractor, along with a pipe wrench. The defendants provided photographs of the altered cap, which showed that a hole was drilled into it with a connection welded over it. Lavin and Lathlean's affidavits demonstrate that they suspected that tampering with the fire hydrant had occurred, potentially including an unsafe cross-connection to the water system, which they believed could lead to contamination and endanger the health and safety of Aquarion's customers.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   They attested that the plaintiff confronted\n   them and yelled at them to get off his property. They also attested that the plaintiff threatened to get a gun and kill them if they did not get off his property. At that point, Lathlean decided to call the police. By\n   submitting the plaintiff's deposition testimony, the defendants demonstrated that the plaintiff knew that they were Aquarion workers and had arrived in Aquarion trucks, that there was a hydrant on his property, and that he suspected that they were there to inspect the hydrant even before he walked over to them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The plaintiff filed an amended memorandum of law in opposition to the defendants' motion for summary judgment on August 26, 2016, which he supported with court transcripts, deposition transcripts, and an interrogatory response from the defendants. On August 29, 2016, the defendants filed a reply memorandum to the plaintiff's opposition, and the court held a hearing on the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   On January 5, 2017, the court issued a memorandum of decision. As to the trespass claims in counts one through four, the court concluded that the defendants were entitled to summary judgment on two separate grounds: (1) Aquarion \"has an express easement to enter upon the property\"; and (2) even in the absence of an express easement, the defendants' entry was also \"permitted by the Department of Public Utilit[y] Control.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   As to the negligent infliction of emotional distress\n   claim in count five directed against Doyle, the court concluded that summary judgment was appropriate because there was no genuine issue of material fact and that her conduct did not rise to the level necessary to sustain such a claim because she never spoke to the plaintiff. As to the negligent infliction of emotional distress claims against the other defendants in counts six through eight, the court denied the motion for summary judgment on their statute of limitations argument because it concluded that a trier of fact might find \"that the actionable harm was not sustained, until sometime after July 11, 2011, when the extent of [the plaintiff's] alleged distress became known.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   As to the intentional infliction of emotional distress claims in counts nine through twelve, the court concluded that\n   the defendants' alleged conduct \"does not even approach the threshold for extreme and outrageous conduct.\" As to the invasion of privacy claims in counts thirteen through sixteen, the court granted the motion for summary judgment stating that the \"claims are utterly unsupported by the facts, even when viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff.\" As to the CUTPA claim in count seventeen against Aquarion, the court concluded, inter alia, that the plaintiff failed to present evidence to \"establish any ascertainable loss.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On February 7, 2017, the defendants filed a motion requesting permission to file a supplemental motion for summary judgment because they obtained \"irrefutable evidence\" that showed that the plaintiff failed to commence the action on the remaining negligent infliction of emotional distress counts (six through eight) within\n   the applicable statute of limitations. On the same day, the court granted the motion, and the defendants filed a supplemental motion for summary judgment. On March 27, 2017, the defendant filed an objection to the defendants' supplemental motion, attaching to it an affidavit and deposition transcripts. On April 10, 2017, the court held a hearing on the motion and rendered summary judgment in favor of the defendants on the remaining counts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   It concluded that the \"actionable harm was sustained in September of 2011, and the action brought in July of 2014 [was] time barred by the applicable statute of limitations ....\" (Citation omitted.) This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Our review of a trial court's decision granting a motion for summary judgment is well established. Practice Book \u00a7 17-49 provides that the \"judgment sought shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" \"A material fact is a fact that will make a difference in the result of the case.... The facts at issue are those alleged in the pleadings....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"In seeking summary judgment, it is the movant who has the burden of showing the nonexistence of any issue of fact. The courts are in entire agreement that the moving party for summary judgment has the burden of showing the absence of any genuine issue as to all the material facts, which, under applicable principles of substantive law, entitle him to a judgment as a matter of law. The courts hold the movant to a strict standard. To satisfy his burden the movant must make a showing that it is quite clear what the truth is, and that excludes\n   any real doubt as to the existence of any genuine issue of material fact.... As the burden of proof is on the movant, the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the opponent....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \"The party opposing a motion for summary judgment must present evidence that demonstrates the existence of some disputed factual issue .... The movant has the burden of showing the nonexistence of such issues but the evidence thus presented, if otherwise sufficient, is not rebutted by the bald statement that an issue of fact does exist.... To oppose a motion for summary judgment successfully, the nonmovant must recite specific facts ... which contradict those stated in the movant's affidavits and documents.... The opposing party to a motion for summary judgment must substantiate its adverse\n   claim by showing that there is a genuine issue of material fact together with the evidence disclosing the existence of such an issue.... The existence of the genuine issue of material fact must be demonstrated by counteraffidavits and concrete evidence....

We have found no place in the plaintiff's principal brief where he challenges this other ground for granting the motion for summary judgment on his trespass claims. Although he appears to raise the issue for the first time in his reply brief after the defendants' brief drew his attention to this independent ground, it is a well established principle that \"[c]laims ... are unreviewable when raised for the first time in a reply brief.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    SS-II, LLC\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bridge Street Associates\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4148039\" index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/293/287/#p302\">\n    293 Conn. 287\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 302,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=977%20A.2d%20189\">\n    977 A.2d 189\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   Accordingly, we conclude that the plaintiff's trespass claims are moot, and, therefore, this court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to consider those claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The plaintiff next challenges the court's granting of the supplemental motion for summary judgment as to his negligent infliction of emotional distress claims. In particular, he argues that the court improperly concluded that his claims were barred by the two year statute of limitations in General Statutes \u00a7 52-584\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   because,\n   in his view, \"the continuing course of conduct doctrine may be applied in the present case to toll the statute of limitations.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendants argue, however, that the continuing course of conduct doctrine is inapplicable as a matter of law in this case. We agree with the defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Section 52-584 provides in relevant part: \"No action to recover damages for injury to the person ... shall be brought but within two years from the date when the injury is first sustained or discovered or in the exercise of reasonable care should have been discovered, and except that no such action may be brought more than three years from the date of the act or omission complained of ....\" We have explained that this\n   statute imposes two particular time requirements on plaintiffs. \"The first requirement, referred to as the discovery portion ... requires a plaintiff to bring an action within two years from the date when the injury is first sustained or discovered or in the exercise of reasonable care should have been discovered .... The second provides that in no event shall a plaintiff bring an action more than three years from the date of the act or omission complained of.... The three year period specifies the time beyond which an action under \u00a7 52-584 is absolutely barred, and the three year period is, therefore, a statute of repose.\" (Emphasis omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Mollica\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Toohey\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6781904\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/134/607/#p612\">\n    134 Conn.

The defendants also filed with their motion a sealed copy of the plaintiff's medical records that documented the plaintiff's visit with a psychiatrist on September 6, 2011-two months after the incident on his property. The defendants argued that the plaintiff did not commence counts six through eight within two years of his actionable harm and, thus, was time barred from bringing those counts. First, the defendants argued that the plaintiff's actionable harm occurred on the day of the incident, July 11, 2011, because the plaintiff alleges in his complaint that the defendants terrorized him on that day, which made him fearful and anxious. Second, they argued that even if the plaintiff did not realize that the defendants caused him emotional distress on July 11, 2011, his medical records indisputably demonstrate that he discovered his injury on September 6, 2011, when his psychiatrist diagnosed him with depression after he complained that he was \"depressed/angry\" because \"water officials came to his property and accused him of stealing water.\" The plaintiff indicated to the psychiatrist that he was going to \"hurt\" the defendants by seeking legal recourse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   On March 27, 2017, the plaintiff filed an objection to the defendants' supplemental motion for summary judgment and a memorandum of law. In support of his objection, he included an affidavit and excerpts from deposition transcripts of Doyle, Lavin, and Lathlean.

See 3 Restatement (Second), supra, \u00a7 652B, comment (d). In the context of intrusion upon seclusion, questions about the reasonable person standard are ordinarily questions of fact, but they become questions of law if reasonable persons can draw only one conclusion from the evidence. See\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Leuthner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1598267\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/156/422/#p424\">\n    156 Conn. 422\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 424-25,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=242%20A.2d%20728\">\n    242 A.2d 728\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1968).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   To analyze whether the evidence created a question of fact, we will examine each of those elements in turn. The plaintiff argues that the defendants unreasonably intruded upon his seclusion by going onto his private premises. He argues that the defendants \"proceeded to walk well beyond any claimed consent, authority, or reasonable use of an easement,\" and subjected him and his family to \"offensive verbal comments\" by accusing him of stealing water.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   As stated previously, the first element of the tort of invasion of privacy by intrusion upon seclusion is an intentional intrusion, physical or otherwise. Although courts often use the phrase \"intentional intrusion,\" the Restatement does not define it. A few courts, however, have done so. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    O'Donnell\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10536602\" index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/891/1079/#p1082\">\n    891 F.2d 1079\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1082 (3d Cir. 1989). In\n   <em>\n    O'Donnell\n   </em>\n   , the plaintiff was a former patient of the Veterans Administration (administration), who brought an action against the administration for intrusion upon seclusion when it released a summary of his psychiatric treatment to his employer without obtaining authorization to do so.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10536602\" index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/891/1079/#p1082\">\n    Id., at 1081\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The trial court granted the administration's motion for summary judgment.\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"10536602\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/891/1079/#p1082\">\n    Id., at 1080\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . In reviewing the claim on appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit defined \"intent\" by looking to \u00a7 8 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, which defines the term to mean \"that the actor desires to cause the consequences of his act, or that he believes that the consequences are substantially certain to result from it.\"\n   <em>\n    O'Donnell\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 1083. Because the Restatement is devoid of any definition for the term \"intrusion,\" the court looked to a dictionary for guidance. Id. We follow suit. Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary (11th Ed. 2003) defines \"intrude\" to mean to thrust or force in or upon someone or something especially without permission or welcome. Moreover, the comments and illustrations to \u00a7 652B of the Restatement (Second) of Torts suggest that an intrusion upon seclusion\n   claim typically involves a defendant who does not believe that he or she has either the necessary personal permission or legal authority to do the intrusive act. See 3 Restatement (Second), supra, \u00a7 652B, comment (b), illustrations (1)-(5).\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   We thus conclude, as other courts have, that an actor commits an intentional intrusion if he believes, or is substantially certain, that he lacks the necessary legal or personal permission to commit the intrusive act. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Mauri\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Smith\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"488604\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/324/476/#p483\">\n    324 Or. at 484\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"488604\" index=\"50\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or/324/476/#p483\">\n    929 P.2d 307\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    O'Donnell\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 1083.\n   In the present case, the defendants' submissions in support of their motion for summary judgment reflect that they believed that they had permission to service the hydrant on the plaintiff's property by either the easement or the tariff approved by PURA. Additionally, they provided the hydrant maintenance records from 1965 to 2004 and 2008 to 2014, which demonstrated that they had routinely maintained the hydrant on the plaintiff's property for decades. Even if we assume arguendo that the plaintiff was correct in that the defendants misused their easement or tariff rights and their conduct constituted a trespass, a reasonable person could not conclude on the basis of the record before us that the defendants thrusted or forced in or upon the plaintiff's property to constitute an intentional intrusion. Nor could a reasonable person find that the defendants' presence on the property, coupled with statements made to the plaintiff accusing him of stealing water, was the type of substantial interference the Restatement contemplates as necessary to constitute an intentional intrusion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   Even if the plaintiff could demonstrate that the record was sufficient to create a question of material fact with respect to the first element, he is unable to do so with respect to the others. The second element requires that the intentional intrusion be upon the plaintiff's solitude or seclusion or private affairs or concerns. The plaintiff therefore must show that he had an objectively reasonable expectation of seclusion or solitude in that place. See\n   <em>\n    Shulman\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Group W Productions, Inc.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"344184\" index=\"51\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/cal-4th/18/200/#p232\">\n    18 Cal. 4th 200\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 232,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"52\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=74%20Cal.%20Rptr.%202d%20843\">\n    74 Cal.Rptr.2d 843\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"53\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=955%20P.2d%20469\">\n    955 P.2d 469\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1998). \"The invasion may be by physical intrusion into a place in which the plaintiff has secluded himself, as when the defendant forces his way\n   into the plaintiff's room in a hotel or insists over the plaintiff's objection in entering his home.\" 3 Restatement (Second), supra, \u00a7 652B, comment (b). Viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, the submissions before the court do not support a finding that the driveway area where the defendants parked their vehicles, the area where they walked to discover and service the hydrant, or the open canopy tent located approximately ten feet from the hydrant where they found the cap, were private areas in which the plaintiff had secluded himself. At no point does the plaintiff indicate that the defendants entered his residence or that they compromised any private information or the general\n   privacy of the plaintiff. Accordingly, the conduct the plaintiff attributes to the defendants cannot, as a matter of law, sustain the second element.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   As to the third and final element of the tort, it requires that the intentional intrusion upon a plaintiff's solitude or seclusion be highly offensive to a reasonable person. As we noted previously, there is \"no liability unless the interference with the plaintiff's seclusion is a substantial one, of a kind that would be highly offensive to the ordinary reasonable man, as the result of conduct to which the reasonable man would strongly object.\" Id., comment (d). Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, no reasonable person could conclude that the conduct the plaintiff attributed to the defendants was highly offensive. The submissions demonstrate that the defendants, a water company and its employees, were servicing a hydrant the company had maintained for many decades. Although they walked around the plaintiff's property to discover the hydrant, searched in the area of the hydrant for the missing and altered cap, and allegedly accused the plaintiff of stealing water, a reasonable person would not find this conduct to be highly offensive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   On the basis of the foregoing, we conclude that the trial court did not commit error in rendering summary judgment in favor of the defendants on the invasion of privacy claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   IV\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   The plaintiff next claims that the court incorrectly granted the motion for summary judgment in favor of the defendants as to his intentional infliction of emotional distress claims (counts nine through twelve). The plaintiff argues that \"[w]hile the events that occurred on July 11, 2011, may not be extreme and outrageous in and of themselves, the continued cooperation of the [defendants] with an unfounded criminal investigation along with the events on July 11, 2011, seem to rise to the standard of extreme and outrageous.\" The plaintiff's argument is without merit, and, therefore, we affirm the judgment as to these counts.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   \"In order for the plaintiff to prevail in a case for liability under ...

Additionally, they traced a red hose that was on the ground near the hydrant to a pond on the property. Lathean and Lavin searched for the cap in the vicinity of the hydrant, where they discovered it next to a wrench under a canopy tent. In viewing all the documents submitted to the court in the manner most favorable to the plaintiff, and assuming that each of the defendants accused the plaintiff of stealing water in a \"rude\" and \"aggressive\" manner, this conduct does not come close to extreme and outrageous conduct.

Even if we were to construe these facts in the plaintiff's favor and consider this argument as a ground against rendering summary judgment, the defendants' mere cooperation with a criminal investigation that the state pursued does not constitute conduct that is so atrocious as to exceed all bounds usually tolerated by a decent society.

Such acts include claiming it had an easement and had only remained on that easement when in fact none existed or it significantly trespassed in an area where it should not have been, without permission and over strenuous objection as aforesaid.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In the defendants' memorandum of law in support of their motion for summary judgment, they argued, inter alia, that the plaintiff did not suffer any ascertainable loss. They argued that when they served him with a second interrogatory in order for him to identify and describe the damages he sustained as a result of the defendants' alleged violation of CUTPA, he responded, \"punitive damages and attorney's fees as authorized by CUTPA to be set by the court for violations.\" On the basis of\n   this response, the defendants argued that he identified no actual damages as a result of Aquarion's purported CUTPA violation. In the plaintiff's objection\n   to the motion, he asserted broadly that he suffered a loss of \"his liberty, being arrested, falsely accused of committing crimes upon his property, injured during the arrest and suffering physical, emotional and mental damages ... as well as financial loses.\" However, he provided no affidavits or other relevant documentary evidence to demonstrate any loss. The court concluded that the plaintiff failed to establish any ascertainable loss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   On appeal, the plaintiff argues that he clearly stated during the discovery process \"that a portion of the damages that he sustained are both 'punitive damages and attorney's fees.' \" He then concludes that \"the ascertainable loss [he] suffered ... [is] both the emotional harm and the incurred attorney's fees that stem from the tortious conduct of the defendants.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Here, although the plaintiff suggests that \"punitive damages and attorney's fees\" are sufficient to fulfill the ascertainable loss requirement under CUTPA, he has provided no authority for this contention.
