It has been supposed by counsel that the language of the Revised Statutes in the section 2 <em>R. S. </em>352, \u00a7 10, authorizing notice of matter intended to be proved on the trial to be given with the plea in certain cases, had changed the rule of pleading in allowing <em>nil debet </em>to be interposed in cases where heretofore it had not been permitted. This is a mistake. The language of the statute is \u201c whenever he,\u201d the defendant, \u201cshall plead <em>nil debet </em>to an action of debt on. judgment,\u201d he may give notice, &amp;c. The sole object of the statute in reference to this plea was to authorize notice of special matter to be given with the plea of <em>nil debet </em>in cases where <em>such plea </em>might <em>before </em>the statute have been put in according to the settled rules of pleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-14\">Judgment for plaintiffs.</p>\n<p id=\"b266-15\">END OF OCTOBER TERM.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
