Darwin </em>Smith, for plaintiff in error.</attorneys>\n<p data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"legal\" id=\"AAb\">The mayor\u2019s court of Rochester is an inferior court of limited and special jurisdiction, having cognizance only of actions <em>arising within the </em>city, of actions against persons who shall have been <em>inhabitants </em>for six months before suit brought, and of actions for penalties in the name of the mayor and common council. <em>Stat. Sess, of </em>1834, <em>p. </em>333, \u00a7 1. f The error relied on is, that it does not appear by the declaration that the cause of action arose within the city of Rochester, or that the defendant had been an inhabitant for six months before the commencement of the suit. The plaintiffs should have alleged that <em>the goods were </em>sold, that the <em>work was done </em>and the <em>money had and </em>received, &amp;c., within the jurisdiction of the court, as well as that the <em>promise </em>was made there. 1 <em>Chitty's Pl. </em>250. 1 <em>T.

Nothing is to be <em>intended </em>within the jurisdiction of an inferior court, the proceedings must show jurisdiction. 1 <em>Saund. </em>74, b, <em>n. </em>1. 1 <em>Bacon's Ab. </em>562. 6 <em>T.

J.</author>\n<p id=\"AAo\">This being an action brought before an inferior court, there can be no doubt of the rule, that in all such cases it is necessary that every part of that which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>constitutes the gist and substance, in other words, the cause of the action, should appear upon the record to be within the jurisdiction of the court 5 therefore, as it is said, the <em>consideration </em>as well as the <em>promise </em>itself, must be laid in the declaration to be within the jurisdiction of the court, and the omission is error even after verdict. <em>Stanman </em>v. <em>Davis, </em>1 <em>Salk. </em>404, <em>and note. 2 Ld.

I admit that the <em>sale and delivery </em>of the goods constitute the gist of the action, the <em>promise </em>arising by operation of law 5 and yet, notwithstanding the literal strictness of some of the cases which has been a subject of regret, I cannot but think that it appears with reasonable certainty that the sale and delivery took place within the jurisdiction of the court. The declaration would probably have been bad on special demurrer, but after verdict, it should be deemed sufficiently explicit: the place to be regarded as relating to the <em>sale and delivery </em>as well as tg the <em>indebtedness. </em>It is neither a violation of grammar nor of sound construction of the language in the connexion used, so to understand it. An ambiguous expression in a declaration is cured by verdict, and must afterwards be taken to have been used in that sense which will sustain' the verdict. 1 <em>Barn. &amp; Cres. </em>296. Our statute of amendments is somewhat broader than the English, and many technicalities necessarily regarded in England are here to be overlooked; though I admit, that if we were bound to construe the declaration, as having omitted altogether the averment of jurisdiction, the defect would not be cured by the verdict. But the statute affords very strong evidence of the liberal spirit with which pleadings are to be regarded by the courts after trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
