J.</author>\n<p id=\"aei-dedup-0\">Appellant Diane C. Asbury challenges her conviction for the murder of her former longtime boyfriend Anthony Simiele. Simiele came to Asbury\u2019s house to reclaim some belongings he had left in her garage. They argued, and when he followed her upstairs to her bedroom, she pulled out a handgun she kept near her bed and shot him. Asbury raises several challenges to her conviction, both on direct appeal and in a petition for a writ of habeas corpus. We reverse her conviction on the ground that the trial court erred by refusing to instruct the jury regarding voluntary manslaughter under a heat of passion theory. We deny the petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-6\">FACTS AND PROCEEDINGS BELOW</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-7\">Asbury and Simiele had been in a relationship for most of 26 years and lived together for 20 of those years. They never married, but Simiele was the father of Asbury\u2019s 23-year-old daughter Victoria. Although they had previously had several brief separations over the years, the couple broke up permanently in October 2010, when Simiele moved out of the house Asbury owned. Asbury had suffered from breast cancer and depression, and she believed Simiele had not done enough to take care of her when she was sick.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-8\">According to Mary Huang, Simiele\u2019s girlfriend of three months, on April 24, 2011, Asbury went to Simiele\u2019s house unannounced, arriving as they were about to eat Easter dinner. Simiele invited Asbury into the house and introduced her to Huang. When Huang told her she had been dating Simiele for a few months, Asbury became visibly angry. Simiele and Asbury argued about their bills and mortgage, and about their daughter Victoria. Asbury admitted that at one point, she called Huang a \u201cf-ing C\u201d and told her to \u201cwait until you have cancer.\u201d According to Huang, Simiele accused Asbury of having held a gun to Victoria\u2019s head when Victoria was sick, and then to her own head. Asbury did not respond to the accusation. Huang testified that Asbury did not appear to be afraid of Simiele. According to Asbury, after this incident, her depression worsened, and she could not stop crying.</p>\n<p id=\"b1088-9\">Asbury\u2019s friend Patricia Love testified that Asbury told her about the Easter confrontation. In their daily conversations, Asbury often told Love that she was upset that Simiele had a new girlfriend, and sometimes told her that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1225\">*1225</page-number>she was upset that she was no longer with Simiele. Asbury later told police that she was ambivalent about whether she wanted to get back together with Simiele. Asbury told Love that she drove past Simiele\u2019s house looking for Simiele\u2019s and Huang\u2019s cars. Love cautioned Asbury to stop and believed Asbury was obsessed about Simiele and Huang\u2019s relationship. Love told Asbury it was not a good idea for Asbury to keep a gun in her home, but Asbury told her that she needed the gun in case Simiele ever attacked her. Asbury did not tell Love that Simiele had ever attacked her in the past, but she did tell Love that Simiele had once threatened to \u201ccall [her] out\u201d in front of their peers and friends, and that he had once headbutted their daughter. Asbury later told police that Simiele had screamed at her, slammed tables, and threatened their daughter Victoria. Although he had once hit her when she threatened to have an abortion, Asbury admitted that he had not been violent toward her recently.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-5\">According to Asbury, she and Simiele, along with Victoria, attended a wedding in San Francisco in early May 2011. Asbury became upset because she thought Simiele was monopolizing Victoria.</p>\n<p id=\"b1089-6\">Asbury gave the only account of what happened on the day of the shooting. She told police that Simiele called her to arrange to pick up possessions he had left in her garage. Because Asbury worked at night and would be sleeping during the day on Sunday, she requested that he come on Monday. He agreed. Simiele came to Asbury\u2019s house on the afternoon of Sunday, May 29, 2011, and banged on the door until Asbury let him in. They argued. According to Asbury, Simiele picked up a hammer from the floor, saying it belonged to him. Asbury told Simiele she was going to bed, and he should not follow her. In spite of this request, Simiele followed her upstairs, saying he had a right to do so. When police later searched Asbury\u2019s residence, the only hammer they discovered was a sledgehammer on the lower level of the house. Asbury did not remember seeing it when Simiele went upstairs. Asbury told Simiele to leave, but he stayed in the room and kept yelling at her. Simiele told Asbury that if she wanted to confront him again, she should bring her \u201ctough guy friends.\u201d Asbury picked up the handgun she kept by her bed and told Simiele to leave. Asbury told friends that she kept a gun in her house for protection, including from Simiele. She had owned the gun for approximately 20 years, and had bought ammunition for it only about a month earlier. Asbury had suffered from breast cancer, and had surgery for a double mastectomy. This surgery had compromised her strength, and at the time of the shooting, she struggled when trying to lift 25 pounds. Simiele took one step toward Asbury, and she felt afraid that he was going to attack her and strangle her. She fired the gun. According to a firearms expert, Asbury fired this shot at a distance of approximately four feet away from Simiele. The bullet traveled upward from the gun, but it exited Simiele\u2019s body at a lower point than where it entered. The expert concluded <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1226\">*1226</page-number>from this that Simiele was either leaning forward toward Asbury or covering his face with one leg off the ground, shielding himself from the bullet. The bullet struck Simiele on the left side of his torso, below his ribs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-4\">Simiele jumped at Asbury and tried to wrestle the gun away from her. In the process, he fell on top of Asbury. She fired the gun again. A firearms examiner testified that the trajectory analysis indicated that Asbury had fired this second shot with the gun resting against her thigh, and that the bullet had traveled through her pants at an upward angle. According to the examiner, this was consistent with Asbury lying on her back and struggling over the weapon with Simiele.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-5\">Asbury called 911 on her cell phone and started performing CPR. She ran down the stairs, put the gun in a pile of laundry, and ran out of the house. She told the 911 dispatcher that Simiele had come to her house and started attacking her, and so \u201cI got my gun and I shot him.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-6\">Police officers and paramedics appeared on the scene, but they were unable to save Simiele\u2019s life. Asbury\u2019s only injuries were a bruise on her leg and a scratch on her wrist.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-7\">After the shooting, police officers searched Asbury\u2019s cell phone. They found a picture of Simiele\u2019s truck and another of a firearms range target. In approximately 1,200 text messages between Asbury and her daughter Victoria, there was no mention of any headbutting or other act of violence by Simiele to Victoria, nor any warning from Asbury that Simiele might be dangerous. Phone records showed that Asbury had called Simiele on seven days in April and May, including the day before the shooting, and that Simiele had called Asbury twice the day before the shooting.</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-8\">An information charged Asbury with one count of murder, in violation of Penal Code section 187, subdivision (a),<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> with an allegation that Asbury personally and intentionally discharged a firearm causing great bodily injury and death (\u00a7 12022.53, subds. (c)-(d)), and that she personally used a firearm. <em>(Id, </em>subd. (b).)</p>\n<p id=\"b1090-9\">A jury found Asbury not guilty of first degree murder, but guilty of second degree murder. The jury also found true the allegation that Asbury discharged a firearm. The trial court sentenced Asbury to 15 years to life imprisonment for second degree murder, plus a mandatory consecutive term of 25 years to life for the enhancement, for a total term of 40 years to life in prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1227\">*1227</page-number>DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-5\">We address Asbury\u2019s direct appeal and her petition for writ of habeas corpus together in a single opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-6\">I. <em>The Direct Appeal</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1091-7\">Asbury raises several claims on appeal. She contends that the evidence proved as a matter of law that she killed Simiele in a heat of passion, and that consequently there was insufficient evidence to support a murder conviction, as opposed to voluntary manslaughter. Alternatively, she argues that the trial court erred by refusing to instruct the jury regarding a heat of passion theory of voluntary manslaughter. Next, she contends that the trial court undermined the integrity of her trial by severely limiting voir dire. Next, she contends that the trial court erred by denying her motion for a new trial made on the ground that her attorney provided ineffective assistance of counsel by failing to investigate and present expert testimony regarding intimate partner battering. Finally, she contends that the prosecution committed misconduct during closing argument by misstating the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. We agree with Asbury\u2019s argument regarding jury instructions, and we reverse her conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-8\">A. <em>Heat of Passion Instruction</em><footnotemark><em>*</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"pAiI\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"52\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABdUAAAA0AQAAAABEdOxLAAAA+0lEQVR4nO2YMU7DQBQFnyMKOrgB3ARuFnc5FpE4iM0JSIcRwUPjtVbbIbCeLL1pXIz+1+zalTu0Vz4P7oI/kHYPafeQdg9p95B2D2n3kHYPe29HknpJZ0kXSZOkq6S5FuMii1inxmZqy3VjJSTg+gTzA3AHvAJvwAWYjpU4LbKIderUTG257lSvO7RHPzdHn9uj/+4m/3ld/WJ2/73fLM9Okp4lPUq6l3Rbi36RRZSpVZSpLdf1lZCAGeAIvADvwAfwBXzXYlhkEevU0ExtuW6oxNTlH4eFtHtIu4e0e0i7h7R7SLuHtHtIu4e0e0i7h7R7SLuHtHvYc/sPpXGvO2vMNjsAAAAASUVORK5CYII=\" width=\"1493\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-9\">B. <em>Limitations on Voir Dire</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1091-10\">Asbury contends that the trial court abused its discretion by limiting the time for her trial counsel to question potential jurors during voir dire to only 25 minutes, with no extensions available for further questioning. Even if the court erred in so limiting the questioning, we nonetheless hold that Asbury is not entitled to reversal of her conviction because she has not shown that, as a result of the limitation, her trial was fundamentally unfair.</p>\n<p id=\"b1091-11\">1. <em>Proceedings Below</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1091-12\">Prior to jury selection, the trial court informed the parties how it intended to conduct voir dire. The court planned to ask the prospective jurors to answer a written questionnaire featuring 20 questions about their backgrounds, prior experiences with the legal system, their attitudes toward law <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1228\">*1228</page-number>enforcement, and their personal beliefs.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> The court did not give the parties an opportunity to submit additional questions to supplement the questionnaire. The court allotted 20 minutes to each side for questioning jurors, including alternates, with no additional time provided depending on the number of potential jurors called. When jury selection began, the court called the first 12 potential jurors to the jury box and asked each to state his or her area of residence, occupation, marital status, spouse\u2019s occupation, number of children, and prior experience serving on juries. The court also asked each potential juror if he or she had responded \u201cyes\u201d to any of the questions on the questionnaire regarding personal experience with the justice system, attitude toward law enforcement, personal beliefs, and other similar issues.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> In any case of a \u201cyes\u201d answer, the court asked each juror to explain the answer briefly. As this process went on, the court asked some of the jurors follow-up questions regarding their answers.</p>\n<p id=\"b1092-4\">Once the court had finished, Asbury\u2019s counsel and the prosecution took their turns questioning the first group of 12 potential jurors. Next, the parties began exercising peremptory challenges. After each peremptory challenge, the court replaced the juror who had been excused with one replacement, and proceeded with voir dire of that new juror, asking him or her about any \u201cyes\u201d answers to the questionnaire, and asking follow-up questions. Asbury\u2019s attorney requested that, as a part of the court\u2019s own questioning of these new additions to the panel, the court ask each new prospective juror if he or she would have responded in the affirmative to any of the questions the lawyers had asked earlier.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> The court granted that request. Asbury\u2019s attorney ran out of time after using only four of his 20 peremptory challenges. At this point, the court informed defense counsel that he had already used 25 minutes questioning jurors, and that he would not be permitted to ask further questions on voir dire unless \u201csomething explosive comes up.\u201d The court also <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1229\">*1229</page-number>denied defense counsel\u2019s request to submit follow-up questions for the court to ask. Counsel did not specify the questions, their substance, or subject matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-5\">The court then continued questioning each new potential juror one at a time, in the same manner as before. Pursuant to the request from Asbury\u2019s attorney, the court also asked each prospective juror if he or she would have responded in the affirmative to any of the questions the lawyers had asked earlier. On one occasion, a prospective juror answered that her husband was a member of the NRA. The trial court did not ask any follow-up questions in response. The defense exercised two more peremptory challenges, and the prosecution exercised one. When the court placed new jurors to replace those who had been excused, defense counsel had some opportunity to question the new jurors through the court\u2019s asking whether the juror would have answered any of the attorney\u2019s questions to the panel in the affirmative. During trial, one juror was excused from service and replaced by an alternate, leaving four jurors on the panel whom the defense had not directly questioned.</p>\n<p id=\"b1093-6\">2. <em>Discussion</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1093-7\">Although the issue is a close one,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> given all the circumstances, Asbury is not entitled to a reversal. Code of Civil Procedure section 223 provides that \u2018\u201c[t]he trial court\u2019s exercise of its discretion in the manner in which voir dire is conducted, including any limitation on the time which will be allowed for direct questioning of prospective jurors by counsel . . . , shall not cause any conviction to be reversed unless the exercise of that discretion has resulted in a miscarriage of justice, as specified in Section 13 of Article VI of the California Constitution.\u201d Although the \u2018\u201cmiscarriage of justice\u201d standard is often equated with the \u2018\u201creasonable probability]\u201d test our Supreme Court established in <em>People </em>v. <em>Watson </em>(1956) 46 Cal.2d 818, 836 [299 P.2d 243], this is not universally the case: \u2018\u201c[T]he <em>Watson </em>decision did not purport to overrule or disapprove that portion of the <em>[People </em>v. <em>O\u2019Bryan </em>(1913) 165 Cal. 55 [130 P. 1042]] decision recognizing that with regard to <em>some </em>errors\u2014such as a denial of the right to jury trial\u2014a \u2018miscarriage of justice\u2019 would result from the denial of the right itself, without regard to the state of the evidence.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cahill </em>(1993) 5 Cal.4th 478, 492 [20 Cal.Rptr.2d 582, 853 P.2d 1037].) Thus, in reviewing trial court decisions regarding jury selection, courts have not attempted to evaluate whether the defendant would have likely obtained a better outcome at trial in the absence of the error. Instead, they have examined whether the trial court\u2019s error \u2018\u201caffected [the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1230\">*1230</page-number>defendant\u2019s] right to a fair and impartial jury.\u201d <em>(People v. Yeoman </em>(2003) 31 Cal.4th 93, 114 [2 Cal.Rptr.3d 186, 72 P.3d 1166] [holding that the trial court\u2019s error in depriving defendant of peremptory challenges was harmless because no incompetent juror sat on the panel].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-4\">Courts have reviewed cases involving restrictions on voir dire in this manner. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Holt </em>(1997) 15 Cal.4th 619 [63 Cal.Rptr.2d 782, 937 P.2d 213], our Supreme Court held that in order for reversal to be appropriate, \u2018\u201cthe voir dire by a court [must have been] so inadequate that the reviewing court can say that the resulting trial was fundamentally unfair.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 661, citing <em>Mu\u2019Min </em>v. <em>Virginia </em>(1991) 500 U.S. 415, 425-426 [114 L.Ed.2d 493, 111 S.Ct. 1899].) The court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Chapman </em>(1993) 15 Cal.App.4th 136 [18 Cal.Rptr.2d 738] described the standard for reversal in more concrete terms: \u201c \u2018[W]here ... the trial judge so limits the scope of voir dire that the procedure used for testing does not create any reasonable assurances that prejudice would be discovered if present, he commits reversible error.\u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 141.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-5\">There is no indication in the record that the court\u2019s limitation on voir dire resulted in a fundamentally unfair trial. Nothing in the record shows that any of the jurors were actually biased, and Asbury does not point to anything in the record suggesting that further questioning of a particular juror was necessary. Further, the trial court\u2019s questionnaire and follow-up questions to the individual jurors tested most of the common ways in which a prospective juror might be too biased to serve. Asbury points out that the questionnaire was not exhaustive and did not include all of the suggested areas for questioning included in the Judicial Council\u2019s Standards for Judicial Administration. But those standards are only \u2018\u201crecommended,\u201d not mandatory for trial courts to follow in every detail. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bolden </em>(2002) 29 Cal.4th 515, 538 [127 Cal.Rptr.2d 802, 58 P.3d 931].) Furthermore, the court\u2019s questionnaire in this case covered most of the areas described in the Judicial Council\u2019s standards, and most of the omissions and alterations from the standards were relatively minor.</p>\n<p id=\"b1094-6\">The one area in which the trial court\u2019s questionnaire differed from the Judicial Council\u2019s standards in a significant way was with respect to race. The Judicial Council recommends that trial courts ask, where appropriate, \u2018\u201c[i]t may appear that one or more of the parties, attorneys, or witnesses come from a particular national, racial, or religious group (or may have a lifestyle different from your own). Would this in any way affect your judgment or the weight and credibility you would give to their testimony?\u201d (Cal. Stds. Jud. Admin., \u00a7 4.30, subd. (b)(20).) Asbury contends that her conviction must be reversed because the trial court did not ask jurors about their attitudes toward issues of race. Asbury is ethnically Chinese and speaks with an accent, while <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1231\">*1231</page-number>Simiele was Caucasian. \u201cIn a case involving an interracial killing, ... a trial court during general voir dire is required to question prospective jurors about racial bias <em>on </em>request.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Bolden, </em>supra, 29 Cal.4th at p. 539, citing <em>Turner </em>v. <em>Murray </em>(1986) 476 U.S. 28, 36-37 [90 L.Ed.2d 27, 106 S.Ct. 1683].)</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-5\">Asbury\u2019s attorney did not request that the trial court ask potential jurors about their attitudes toward race. Asbury argues that such a request was not necessary because it would have been futile (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Abbaszadeh </em>(2003) 106 Cal.App.4th 642, 648 [130 Cal.Rptr.2d 873]), in that the trial court made clear that it would not allow the parties to request additions to the questionnaire. But the trial court granted Asbury\u2019s counsel\u2019s request that the court ask new prospective jurors if they would have responded in the affirmative to any of the questions Asbury\u2019s attorney had asked other jurors. If counsel had explained the relevance and what the standards recommend, it is not at all clear that the court would have denied the request. Most importantly, appellant has not demonstrated that questions on the subject were necessary in this particular case. Indeed, Asbury\u2019s attorney, in his judgment regarding the issues most important to the case, did not ask a single question regarding race to any of the prospective jurors during his 25 minutes of voir dire. If race was an important consideration, we would expect that he would have done so.</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-6\">Asbury also argues that her conviction must be overturned because the trial court\u2019s imposition of a blanket time limit on voir dire was per se improper. She cites Code of Civil Procedure section 222.5, which provides that \u201c[s]pecific unreasonable or arbitrary time limits shall not be imposed in any case. The trial judge shall not establish a blanket policy of a time limit for voir dire.\u201d By its own terms, however, that code section establishes rules \u201c[t]o select a fair and impartial jury in <em>civil </em>jury trials.\u201d <em>{Ibid., </em>italics added.) We are not persuaded that the provision barring blanket policies of time limits for voir dire applies more broadly than the remainder of the text in that section. This is especially true in light of the fact that the next section of the code explicitly addresses voir dire in criminal trials and provides that \u201c[t]he court may, in the exercise of its discretion, limit the oral and direct questioning of prospective jurors by counsel. The court may specify the maximum amount of time that counsel for each party may question an individual juror, or may specify an aggregate amount of time for each party, which can then be allocated among the prospective jurors by counsel.\u201d (Code Civ. Proc, \u00a7 223.)</p>\n<p id=\"b1095-7\">The trial court required all of these jurors to answer the questionnaire, asked follow-up questions to inquire about the jurors\u2019 affirmative answers in the questionnaire, allowed the attorneys to ask questions, albeit for a relatively short time, and asked if the jurors would have answered yes to any of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1232\">*1232</page-number>the questions Asbury\u2019s attorney had asked the other jurors.
