Code, \u00a7 667.5, subd. (c)) or serious (as defined by Pen. Code, \u00a7 1192.7, subd. (c)), filed a petition pursuant to the Three Strikes Reform Act of 2012 (hereafter Proposition 36 or the Act) to have his sentence recalled and to be resentenced.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> (\u00a7 1170.126, subd. (b).) Following a hearing, the trial court concluded resentencing would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety and denied the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b855-12\">In the published portion of this opinion, we hold the People have the burden of proving, by a preponderance of the evidence, facts on which a finding that resentencing a petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety reasonably can be based. Those facts are reviewed for substantial evidence. We further hold the preponderance of the evidence standard does not apply to the trial court\u2019s determination regarding dangerousness, nor does section 1170.126, subdivision (1), create a presumption in favor of resentencing. The ultimate decision\u2014whether resentencing an inmate would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety\u2014instead lies within the sound discretion of the trial court. We also hold section 1170.18, subdivision (c) does not modify section 1170.126, subdivision (1). As we explain in the unpublished portion of our opinion, we find no abuse of discretion and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b856-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"894\">*894</page-number>FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY<footnotemark>*</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"pASb\">\n<img class=\"p\" height=\"43\" src=\"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAABeMAAAArAQAAAADTGa56AAAA8ElEQVR4nO2YMU7EQBAE2ycCZ/AD+An8zGQ8CyQegu8FXIYl7C0C31jLpofV4jQVujSj8nojd+j/cjy4Cy4i631kvY+s95H1PrLeR9b7yHofV1B/kjRJmiUhSc+S3iSNlSghQ8RUaad2XFdqIQngHTgCJ2B+hHIP3AIvlZiGVW4ipkJsUzuum4ZKMB7a15/b1x91yWn+8bpfH+cq7v2TpAdJd5Juzg87aT2TEP1ZbiKm+nZqx3V9LbTe+0/gC/gGCsAAvAIflVhChoippZ3acd1SC8Yu/4jYyHofWe8j631kvY+s95H1PrLeR9b7yHofP9drsz35xao3AAAAAElFTkSuQmCC\" width=\"1507\"/>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b856-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b856-5\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b856-6\">The Applicable Legal Principles</p>\n<p id=\"b856-7\">In order to be eligible for resentencing as a second strike offender under the Act, the inmate petitioner must satisfy the three criteria set out in subdivision (e) of section 1170.126.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> <em>(People </em>v. <em>Superior Court (Martinez) </em>(2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 979, 988-989 [170 Cal.Rptr.3d 763].) If the inmate satisfies all three criteria, as did defendant, he or she \u201cshall be resentenced [as a second strike offender] unless the court, in its discretion, determines that resentencing the [inmate] would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.\u201d (\u00a7 1170.126, subd. (f).) In exercising this discretion, \u201cthe court may consider: [\u00b6] (1) The [inmate]\u2019s criminal conviction history, including the type of crimes committed, the extent of injury to victims, the length of prior prison commitments, and the remoteness of the crimes; [\u00b6] (2) The [inmate] \u2019s disciplinary record and record of rehabilitation while incarcerated; and [\u00b6] (3) Any other evidence the court, within its discretion, determines to be relevant in deciding whether a new sentence would result in an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.\u201d <em>{Id., </em>subd. (g).)</p>\n<p id=\"b856-8\">A. <em>A trial court\u2019s ultimate determination regarding dangerousness lies within its discretion; its ruling, therefore, is reviewed for abuse of discretion.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b856-9\">The plain language of subdivisions (1) and (g) of section 1170.126 calls for an exercise of the sentencing court\u2019s discretion. \u201c \u2018Discretion is the power to make the decision, one way or the other.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>{People </em>v. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number><em>Carmony </em>(2004) 33 Cal.4th 367, 375 [14 Cal.Rptr.3d 880, 92 P.3d 369].) \u201cWhere, as here, a discretionary power is statutorily vested in the trial court, its exercise of that discretion \u2018must not be disturbed on appeal <em>except </em>on a showing that the court exercised its discretion in an arbitrary, capricious or patently absurd manner that resulted in a manifest miscarriage of justice. [Citations.]\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Rodrigues </em>(1994) 8 Cal.4th 1060, 1124-1125 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 235, 885 P.2d 1]; see <em>People </em>v. <em>Williams </em>(1998) 17 Cal.4th 148, 162 [69 Cal.Rptr.2d 917, 948 P.2d 429] [abuse of discretion review asks whether ruling in question falls outside bounds of reason under applicable law and relevant facts].)</p>\n<p id=\"b857-5\">Under the clear language of section 1170.126, the ultimate determination that resentencing would pose an unreasonable risk of danger is a discretionary one. We, therefore, review that determination for abuse of discretion. Of course, if there is no evidence in the record to support the decision, the decision constitutes an abuse of discretion. (See <em>In re Robert L. </em>(1993) 21 Cal.App.4th 1057, 1066 [24 Cal.Rptr.2d 654].)</p>\n<p id=\"b857-6\">B. <em>The burden of proof of preponderance of the evidence applies to proof of the facts, not to the trial court\u2019s ultimate determination.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b857-7\">Defendant asserts he cannot be denied resentencing unless the People proved dangerousness beyond a reasonable doubt. Alternatively, he says, the People must at least have proven the ultimate conclusion of dangerousness by a preponderance of the evidence. Although we agree preponderance of the evidence is the appropriate standard, we disagree with defendant on its application to the ultimate determination.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b857-8\">\u201cThe standard of proof, the United States Supreme Court has said, \u2018serves to allocate the risk of error between the litigants and to indicate the relative importance attached to the ultimate decision.\u2019 [Citation.] At one end of the spectrum is the \u2018preponderance of the evidence\u2019 standard, which apportions the risk of error among litigants in roughly equal fashion. [Citation.] At the other end of the spectrum is the \u2018beyond a reasonable doubt\u2019 standard applied in criminal cases, in which \u2018our society imposes almost the entire risk of error upon itself.\u2019 [Citation.] Between those two standards is the intermediate standard of clear and convincing evidence. [Citation.] These three standards are codified in California\u2019s Evidence Code. Section 115 of that code states: \u2018The burden of proof may require a party to . . . establish the existence or nonexistence of a fact by a preponderance of the evidence, by <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>clear and convincing proof, or by proof beyond a reasonable doubt. [\u00b6] <em>Except as otherwise provided by law, the burden of proof requires proof by a preponderance of the evidence.\u2019 </em>(Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b858-4\">\u201cIf the Legislature has not established a standard of proof, a court must determine the appropriate standard by considering all aspects of the law. [Citation.] No standard of proof is specified in sechon [1170.126] ....</p>\n<p id=\"b858-5\">\u201c \u2018The standard of proof that is required in a given instance has been said to reflect \u201c. . . the degree of confidence our society thinks [the factfinder] should have in the correctness of factual conclusions for a particular type of adjudication.\u201d . . . The standard of proof may therefore vary, depending upon the gravity of the consequences that would result from an erroneous determination of the issue involved.\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Arriaga </em>(2014) 58 Cal.4th 950, 961-962 [169 Cal.Rptr.3d 678, 320 P.3d 1141].)</p>\n<p id=\"b858-6\">\u201cIn enachng section 1170.126 as part of Proposition 36, the issue before the voters was not whether a defendant could or should be punished more harshly for a particular aspect of his or her offense, but whether, having already been found to warrant an indeterminate life sentence as a third strike offender, he or she should now be eligible for a lesser term.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Osuna </em>(2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 1020, 1036 [171 Cal.Rptr.3d 55].) Although voters could have permitted automatic resentencing, under any and all circumstances, of those eligible therefor, they did not do so. This demonstrates a recognihon of two highly plausible scenarios: (1) Some inmates sentenced to indeterminate terms under the original version of the three strikes law for crimes not defined as serious or violent felonies may have started out not posing any greater risk of danger than recidivists who will now be sentenced to determinate terms as second strike offenders under the prospective provisions of the Act, but have become violent or otherwise dangerous while imprisoned; or (2) Enough time might have passed since some inmates committed their criminal offenses so that those offenses no longer make such inmates dangerous, but other factors do. Because of the severe consequences to society that may result if a dangerous inmate is resentenced as a second strike offender and released to the community upon completion of his or her term with little or no supervision (see, e.g., \u00a7 3451) and without undergoing any suitability assessment (see, e.g., <em>In re Lawrence </em>(2008) 44 Cal.4th 1181, 1204 [82 Cal.Rptr.3d 169, 190 P.3d 535]), we believe it appropriate to apporhon the risk of error in roughly equal fashion.</p>\n<p id=\"b858-7\">Division Three of the Second District Court of Appeal has stated that, where a court\u2019s discretion under sechon 1170.126, subdivision (f) is concerned, the People bear the burden of proving \u201cdangerousness\u201d by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>(Kaulick, supra, </em>215 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1301-1305 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>&amp; fn. 25; see Evid. Code, \u00a7 115.) That court determined this is so because \u201cdangerousness is not a factor which enhances the sentence imposed when a defendant is resentenced under the Act; instead, dangerousness is a hurdle which must be crossed in order for a defendant to be resentenced at all.\u201d <em>(Kaulick, supra, </em>at p. 1303.) <em>Kaulick </em>explained: \u201cThe maximum sentence to which Kaulick, and those similarly situated to him, is subject was, and shall always be, the indeterminate life term to which he was originally sentenced. While [the Act] presents him with an opportunity to be resentenced to a lesser term, unless certain facts are established, he is nonetheless still subject to the third strike sentence based on the facts established at the time he was originally sentenced. As such, a court\u2019s discretionary decision to decline to modify the sentence in his favor can be based on any otherwise appropriate factor (i.e., dangerousness), and such factor need not be established by proof beyond a reasonable doubt to a jury.\u201d <em>{Ibid.)</em></p>\n<p id=\"b859-5\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Blakely </em>(2014) 225 Cal.App.4th 1042, 1059-1062 [171 Cal.Rptr.3d 70] <em>(Blakely), </em>we rejected the claim an inmate seeking resentenc-ing pursuant to section 1170.126 had a Sixth Amendment right to a jury determination, beyond a reasonable doubt, on the question of conduct constituting a disqualifying factor. We concluded that <em>Apprendi </em>v. <em>New Jersey </em>(2000) 530 U.S. 466 [147 L.Ed.2d 435, 120 S.Ct. 2348] <em>(Apprendi) </em>and its progeny (e.g., <em>Alleyne </em>v. <em>United States </em>(2013) 570 U.S. _ [186 L.Ed.2d 314, 133 S.Ct. 2151]; <em>Cunningham v. California </em>(2007) 549 U.S. 270 [166 L.Ed.2d 856, 127 S.Ct. 856] <em>(Cunningham); Blakely v. Washington </em>(2004) 542 U.S. 296 [159 L.Ed.2d 403, 124 S.Ct. 2531]) \u201cdo not apply to a determination of eligibility for resentencing under the Act.\u201d <em>(Blakely, supra, </em>225 Cal.App.4th at p. 1060.) We also relied heavily on <em>Kaulick.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b859-8\">In rejecting application of the beyond a reasonable doubt standard, <em>Kaulick </em>discussed the United States Supreme Court\u2019s conclusion in <em>Dillon v. United States </em>(2010) 560 U.S. 817, 828 [177 L.Ed.2d 271, 130 S.Ct. 2683] <em>(Dillon), </em>that \u201ca defendant\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to have essential facts found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt do not apply to limits on downward sentence modifications due to intervening laws.\u201d <em>(Kaulick, supra, </em>215 Cal.App.4th at p. 1304.) <em>Kaulick </em>found <em>Dillon\u2019s </em>language applicable. Since the retrospective part of the Act is not constitutionally required, but an act of lenity on the part of the electorate and provides for a proceeding where the original sentence may be modified downward, any facts found at such a proceeding, such as dangerousness, do not implicate Sixth Amendment issues. Thus, there is no constitutional requirement that the facts be established beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>(Kaulick, supra, </em>at pp. 1304-1305.)<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b860-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>Although in <em>Blakely </em>we applied Kaulick\u2019s analysis to the initial determination of eligibility for resentencing under the Act (Blakely, <em>supra, </em>225 Cal.App.4th at p. 1061), it applies equally to the issue whether resentencing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. A denial of an inmate\u2019s petition does not increase the penalty to which the inmate is already subject, but instead removes the inmate from the scope of an act of lenity on the part of the electorate to which he or she is not constitutionally entitled. <em>(Id. </em>at p. 1062.) That the denial is based on a determination of dangerousness does not change that conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-4\"><em>Kaulick </em>found the prosecution bears the burden of establishing \u201cdangerousness\u201d by a preponderance of the evidence against a claim the <em>Apprendi </em>line of cases requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>(Kaulick, supra, </em>215 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1301-1302.) As a result, it had no real occasion to address the interplay between the burden of proof and the trial court\u2019s exercise of discretion as that issue is presented here, or to clarify whether the prosecution is required to establish \u201cdangerousness\u201d in the sense of <em>facts </em>upon which the trial court can base the ultimate determination resentencing a pehtioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety, or in the sense of establishing that determination itself.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Nevertheless, we believe it supports our interpretation.</p>\n<p id=\"b860-5\">Accordingly, we hold preponderance of the evidence is the applicable standard of proof, regardless whether we analyze the issue as one of Sixth Amendment jurisprudence or due process. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Flores, supra, </em>227 Cal.App.4th at p. 1076.)<footnotemark>16</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b860-6\">This does not, however, mean the trial court must apply that standard in making its ultimate determination whether to resentence a petihoner, or we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"899\">*899</page-number>must review that determination for substantial evidence. Nor does it mean evidence of dangerousness must preponderate over evidence of rehabilitation for resentencing to be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-5\">The language of section 1170.126, subdivision (1) expressly provides the petitioner shall be resentenced unless the court, in its discretion, makes a determination that resentencing would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. The statute does not say the petitioner shall be resentenced unless the People prove resentencing would pose such a risk.</p>\n<p id=\"b861-6\">Considering the language of subdivisions (f) and (g) of section 1170.126, we conclude the People have the burden of establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, facts from which a determination resentenc-ing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety can reasonably be made. The reasons a trial court finds resentencing would pose an unreasonable risk of danger, or its weighing of evidence showing dangerousness versus evidence showing rehabilitation, lie within the court\u2019s discretion. The ultimate determination that resentencing would pose an unreasonable risk of danger is a discretionary one. While the determination must be supported by facts established by a preponderance, the trial court need not itself find an unreasonable risk of danger by a preponderance of the evidence. (See <em>In re Robert L, supra, </em>21 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1065-1067 [discussing abuse of discretion and preponderance of the evidence standards].)</p>\n<p id=\"b861-7\">Such an interpretation is consistent with California\u2019s noncapital sentencing scheme.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark> Under the determinate sentencing law (DSL) as it existed prior to <em>Cunningham, </em>\u201cthree terms of imprisonment [were] specified by statute for most offenses. The trial court\u2019s discretion in selecting among [those] options [was] limited by section 1170, subdivision (b), which direct[ed] that \u2018the court shall order imposition of the middle term, unless there are circumstances in aggravation or mitigation of the crime.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Black </em>(2007) 41 Cal.4th 799, 808 [62 Cal.Rptr.3d 569, 161 P.3d 1130], fn. omitted.) Trial courts had \u201cbroad discretion\u201d to impose the lower or upper term instead of the middle term of imprisonment <em>(People </em>v. <em>Scott </em>(1994) 9 Cal.4th 331, 349 [36 Cal.Rptr.2d 627, 885 P.2d 1040]), and generally were required by the statutes and sentencing rules to state reasons for their discretionary sentencing choices <em>{ibid.). </em>Such reasons had to be \u201csupported by a preponderance of the evidence in the record\u201d and reasonably related to the particular sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"900\">*900</page-number>determination. <em>(Ibid.; </em>see Cal. Rules of Court, former rule 4.420(b).) Even after the DSL was reformed and amended in response to <em>Cunningham, </em>so as to eliminate judicial factfinding in selection of the appropriate term when three possible prison terms are specified by statute, establishment of facts by a preponderance of the evidence remains necessary with respect to certain discretionary sentencing decisions. (See <em>In re Coley </em>(2012) 55 Cal.4th 524, 557-558 [146 Cal.Rptr.3d 382, 283 P.3d 1252],)<footnotemark>18</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b862-5\">In <em>People </em>v. <em>Sandoval </em>(2007) 41 Cal.4th 825, 850-851 [62 Cal.Rptr.3d 588, 161 P.3d 1146], the California Supreme Court stated that, in making its discretionary sentencing choices <em>post-Cunningham, </em>\u201cthe trial court need only \u2018state [its] reasons\u2019 [citation]; it is not required to identify aggravating and mitigating factors, <em>apply a preponderance of the evidence standard, </em>or specify the \u2018ultimate facts\u2019 that \u2018justify[] the term selected.\u2019 [Citations.] Rather, the court must \u2018state in simple language the primary factor or factors that support the exercise of discretion.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d (Italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b862-6\">The trial court\u2019s ultimate determination when considering a petition for resentencing under section 1170.126 is analogous to an evaluation of the relative weight of mitigating and aggravating circumstances. Such an evaluation \u201cis not equivalent to a factual finding.\u201d <em>(People v. Black, supra, </em>41 Cal.4th at p. 814, fn. 4.) It follows, then, that the trial court need not apply a preponderance of the evidence standard, in that it need not find resentencing the petitioner would, more likely than not, pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety. (See <em>Kaulick, supra, </em>215 Cal.App.4th at p. 1305, fn. 28 [preponderance standard means \u201c \u2018more likely than not\u2019 \u201d].)<footnotemark>19</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b863-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"901\">*901</page-number>To summarize, a trial court need not determine, by a preponderance of the evidence, that resentencing a petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety before it can properly deny a petition for resentencing under the Act. Nor is the court\u2019s ultimate determination subject to substantial evidence review. Rather, its finding will be upheld if it does not constitute an abuse of discretion, i.e., if it falls within \u201cthe bounds of reason, all of the circumstances being considered. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Giminez </em>(1975) 14 Cal.3d 68, 72 [120 Cal.Rptr. 577, 534 P.2d 65].) The facts upon which the court\u2019s finding of unreasonable risk is based must be proven by the People by a preponderance of the evidence, however, and are themselves subject to our review for substantial evidence. If a factor (for example, that the petitioner participated in a riot, is violent due to repeated instances of mutual combat, etc.) is not established by a preponderance of the evidence, it cannot form the basis for a finding of unreasonable risk.

Leaving aside constitutional questions raised by establishing a presumption in favor of life without parole for juveniles after the United States Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in <em>Miller </em>v. <em>Alabama </em>(2012) 567 U.S. 460 [183 L.Ed.2d 407, 132 S.Ct. 2455], the state high court\u2019s review of the text of section 190.5, subdivision (b) led it to conclude the syntax is ambiguous concerning any presumption. The court stated: \u201cIt is not unreasonable to read this text ... to mean that a court \u2018shall\u2019 impose life without parole unless \u2018at the discretion of the court\u2019 a sentence of 25 years to life appears more appropriate. [Citation.] But it is equally reasonable to read the text to mean that a court may select one of the two penalties in the exercise of its discretion, with no presumption in favor of one or the other. The latter reading accords with common usage. For example, if a teacher informed her students that \u2018you must take a final exam or, at your discretion, write a term paper,\u2019 it would be reasonable for the students to believe they were equally free to pursue either option. The text of section 190.5[, subdivision ](b) does not clearly indicate whether the statute was intended to make life without parole the presumptive sentence.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gutierrez, </em>supra, 58 Cal.4th at p. 1371.)</p>\n<p id=\"b864-5\">The same example can be applied to the syntax of section 1170.126, subdivision (1). Because a reading that affords no presumption \u201caccords with common usage\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Gutierrez, supra, </em>58 Cal.4th at p. 1371), we reject the notion voters must have intended there to be a presumption in favor of resentencing or that courts have only limited discretion to deny resentencing (see <em>People </em>v. <em>Carmony, supra, </em>33 Cal.4th at pp. 377-378 [discussing courts\u2019 circumscribed power to depart, under \u00a7 1385, subd. (a) and <em>People </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(Romero) (1996) 13 Cal.4th 497, 529-530 [53 Cal.Rptr.2d 789, 917 P.2d 628] <em>(Romero), </em>from sentencing norm established by three strikes law]). A court considering whether to resentence an eligible petitioner under section <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"903\">*903</page-number>1170.126, subdivision (1) has circumscribed discretion in the sense it can only refuse to resentence if it finds that to do so would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety on the facts of the particular case before it.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> This does not mean, however, its discretion is circumscribed in the sense it can only find dangerousness in extraordinary cases. To the contrary, it can do so in any case in which such a finding is rational under the totality of the circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-5\">Such a conclusion comports with the plain language of the statute. Moreover, a conclusion resentencing to a second strike term is a generally mandatory presumption from which courts can depart only in extraordinary cases, as defendant asserts, would run directly contrary to the intent of the voters in passing the Act. (See <em>People </em>v. <em>Gutierrez, supra, </em>58 Cal.4th at pp. 1371-1372 [examining legislative history and voter intent in attempt to resolve statutory ambiguity].) As we stated in <em>People </em>v. <em>Osuna, supra, </em>225 Cal.App.4th at page 1036, \u201c \u2018[ejnhancing public safety was a key purpose of the Act\u2019 [citation].\u201d Thus, although one purpose of the Act was to save taxpayer dollars <em>(People </em>v. <em>Osuna, supra, </em>at p. 1037), \u2018\u201c[i]t is clear the electorate\u2019s intent was not to throw open the prison doors to <em>all </em>third strike offenders whose current convictions were not for serious or violent felonies, but <em>only </em>to those who were perceived as nondangerous or posing little or no risk to the public\u201d <em>{id. </em>at p. 1038, second italics added). Had voters intended to permit retention of an indeterminate term only in extraordinary cases, they would have said so in subdivision (1) of section 1170.126, rather than employing language that affords courts broad discretion to find dangerousness. They also would not have afforded the trial court the power to consider any evidence it determined to be relevant to the issue as they did in subdivision (g)(3) of the statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b865-6\">D. <em>Section 1170.18, subdivision (c), enacted pursuant to Proposition 47, does not modify section 1170.126, subdivision (f).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b865-7\">On November 4, 2014, voters enacted Proposition 47, \u2018\u201cthe Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Act\u201d (hereafter Proposition 47). It went into effect the next day. (Cal. Const., art. II, \u00a7 10, subd. (a).) Insofar as is pertinent here, Proposition 47 reduced to misdemeanors certain drug- and theft-related offenses that previously were felonies or \u2018\u201cwobblers,\u201d unless they were committed by certain ineligible defendants. Proposition 47 also created a new resentencing provision\u2014section 1170.18\u2014by which a person currently serving a felony sentence for an offense that is now a misdemeanor, may petition <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"904\">*904</page-number>for a recall of that sentence and request resentencing in accordance with the offense statutes as added or amended by Proposition 47. (\u00a7 1170.18, subd. (a).) A person who satisfies the criteria in subdivision (a) of section 1170.18 shall have his or her sentence recalled and be \u201cresentenced to a misdemeanor . . . unless the court, in its discretion, determines that resentenc-ing the petitioner would pose an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.\u201d <em>{Id., </em>subd. (b).)<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b866-4\">Hidden in the lengthy, fairly abstruse text of the proposed law, as presented in the official ballot pamphlet\u2014and nowhere called to voters\u2019 attention\u2014is the provision defendant contends applies to his petition for resentencing under Proposition 36. Subdivision (c) of section 1170.18 provides: \u201cAs used throughout this Code, \u2018unreasonable risk of danger to public safety\u2019 means an unreasonable risk that the petitioner will commit a new violent felony within the meaning of clause (iv) of subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of Section 667.\u201d Section 667, subdivision (e)(2)(C)(iv) lists the following felonies, sometimes called \u201csuper strike\u201d offenses:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-5\">\u201c(I) A \u2018sexually violent offense\u2019 as defined in subdivision (b) of Section 6600 of the Welfare and Institutions Code.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-6\">\u201c(II) Oral copulation with a child who is under 14 years of age, and who is more than 10 years younger than he or she as defined by Section 288a, sodomy with another person who is under 14 years of age and more than 10 years younger than he or she as defined by Section 286, or sexual penetration with another person who is under 14 years of age, and who is more than 10 years younger than he or she, as defined by Section 289.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-7\">\u201c(Ill) A lewd or lascivious act involving a child under 14 years of age, in violation of Section 288.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-8\">\u201c(IV) Any homicide offense, including any attempted homicide offense, defined in Sections 187 to 191.5, inclusive.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-9\">\u201c(V) Solicitation to commit murder as defined in Section 653f.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-10\">\u201c(VI) Assault with a machine gun on a peace officer or firefighter, as defined in paragraph (3) of subdivision (d) of Section 245.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b866-11\">\u201c(VII) Possession of a weapon of mass destruction, as defined in paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of Section 11418.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b867-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"905\">*905</page-number>\u201c(VIII) Any serious and/or violent felony offense punishable in California by life imprisonment or death.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b867-5\">The question is whether section 1170.18, subdivision (c) now limits a trial court\u2019s discretion to deny resentencing under the Act to those cases in which resentencing the defendant would pose an unreasonable risk he or she will commit a new \u201csuper strike\u201d offense.

As we explain, reading them together, and considering section 1170.18, subdivision (c) in the context of the statutory framework as a whole (see <em>People v. Acosta, supra, </em>29 Cal.4th at p. 112; <em>Lakin v.

Disibio </em>(1992) 7 Cal.App.4th Supp. 1, 5 [9 Cal.Rptr.2d 20]).</p>\n<p id=\"b869-6\">As is evidenced by its title, the Act was aimed solely at revising the three strikes law. That law, as originally enacted by the Legislature, was described by us as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b869-7\">\u201cUnder the three strikes law, defendants are punished not just for their current offense but for their recidivism. Recidivism in the commission of multiple felonies poses a danger to society justifying the imposition of longer sentences for subsequent offenses. [Citation.] The primary goals of recidivist statutes are: \u2018. . . to deter repeat offenders and, at some point in the life of one who repeatedly commits criminal offenses serious enough to be punished as felonies, to segregate that person from the rest of society for an extended period of time. This segregation and its duration are based not merely on that person\u2019s most recent offense but also on the propensities he has demonstrated over a period of time during which he has been convicted of and sentenced for other crimes. Like the line dividing felony theft from petty larceny, the point at which a recidivist will be deemed to have demonstrated the necessary propensities and the amount of time that the recidivist will be isolated from society are matters largely within the discretion of the punishing jurisdiction.\u2019 [Citation.]</p>\n<p id=\"b869-8\">\u201cBy enacting the three strikes law, the Legislature acknowledged the will of Californians that the goals of retribution, deterrence, and incapacitation be given precedence in determining the appropriate punishment for crimes. Further, those goals were best achieved by ensuring \u2018longer prison sentences <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"908\">*908</page-number>and greater punishment\u2019 for second and third \u2018strikers.\u2019 \u201d <em>(People v. Cooper </em>(1996) 43 Cal.App.4th 815, 823-824 [51 Cal.Rptr.2d 106].)<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b870-4\">A few months before the November 6, 2012, general election, the California Supreme Court observed: \u201cOne aspect of the [three strikes] law that has proven controversial is that the lengthy punishment prescribed by the law may be imposed not only when ... a defendant [who has previously been convicted of one or more serious or violent felonies] is convicted of another serious or violent felony but also when he or she is convicted of any offense that is categorized under California law as a felony. This is so even when the current, so-called triggering, offense is nonviolent and may be widely perceived as relatively minor. [Citations.]\u201d <em>(In re Coley, </em>supra, 55 Cal.4th at pp. 528-529.)</p>\n<p id=\"b870-5\">Clearly, by approving the Act, voters resolved this controversy in favor of strike offenders. Thus, one of the \u201cFindings and Declarations\u201d of the Act stated the Act would \u201c[r]estore the Three Strikes law to the public\u2019s original understanding by requiring life sentences only when a defendant\u2019s current conviction is for a violent or serious crime.\u201d (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 6, 2012) text of Prop. 36, \u00a7 1, p. 105.)<footnotemark>25</footnotemark> Nowhere, however, do the ballot materials for the Act suggest voters intended essentially to release existing third strike offenders in all but the most egregious cases, as would be the result if the definition of \u201c \u2018unreasonable risk of danger to public safety\u2019 \u201d contained in section 1170.18, subdivision (c) were engrafted onto resentenc-ing proceedings under section 1170.126, subdivision (1). That voters did <em>not </em>intend such a result is amply demonstrated by the fact an indeterminate life term remains mandatory under the Act for a wide range of current offenses even if the offender does not have a prior conviction for a \u201csuper strike\u201d offense (\u00a7\u00a7 667, subd. (e)(2), 1170.12, subd. (c)(2)), and that an inmate is rendered ineligible for resentencing under section 1170.126 for an array of reasons beyond his or her having suffered such a prior conviction (\u00a7 1170.126, subd. (e)(2)).</p>\n<p id=\"b870-6\">The Act clearly placed public safety above the cost savings likely to accrue as a result of its enactment. Thus, uncodified section 7 of the Act provides: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>\u201cThis act is an exercise of the public power of the people of the State of California <em>for the protection of the health, safety, and welfare of the people of the State of California, </em>and shall be liberally construed to effectuate those purposes.\u201d (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec., <em>supra, </em>text of Prop. 36, p. 110, some italics omitted.) As we explained in <em>People </em>v. <em>Osuna, supra, </em>225 Cal.App.4th at page 1036, \u201cAlthough the Act \u2018diluted\u2019 the three strikes law somewhat [citation], \u2018[enhancing public safety was a key purpose of the Act\u2019 [citation].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b871-5\">In contrast, Proposition 47\u2014while titled \u201cthe Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Act\u201d\u2014emphasized monetary savings. The \u201cFindings and Declarations\u201d state: \u201cThe people of the State of California find and declare as follows: [\u00b6] The people enact the Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Act to ensure that prison spending is focused on violent and serious offenses, to maximize alternatives for nonserious, nonviolent crime, and to invest the savings generated from this act into prevention and support programs in K-12 schools, victim services, and mental health and drug treatment. This act ensures that sentences for people convicted of dangerous crimes like rape, murder, and child molestation are not changed.\u201d (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014) text of Prop. 47, \u00a7 2, p. 70.) Uncodified section 15 of the measure provides: \u201cThis act shall be broadly construed to accomplish its purposes,\u201d while uncodified section 18 states: \u201cThis act shall be liberally construed to effectuate its purposes.\u201d (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec., <em>supra, </em>text of Prop. 47, p. 74.) Proposition 47 requires misdemeanor sentences for various drug possession and property offenses, unless the perpetrator has a prior conviction for a \u201csuper strike\u201d offense or for an offense requiring sex offender registration pursuant to section 290, subdivision (c). (Health &amp; Saf. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 11350, subd. (a), 11357, subd. (a), 11377, subd. (a); Pen. Code, \u00a7\u00a7 459.5, subd. (a), 473, subd. (b), 476a, subd. (b), 490.2, subd. (a), 496, subd. (a), 666, subd. (b).) Section 1170.18 renders ineligible for resentencing <em>only </em>those inmates whose current offense would now be a misdemeanor, but who have a prior conviction for a \u201csuper strike\u201d offense or for an offense requiring sex offender registration pursuant to section 290, subdivision (c). (\u00a7 1170.18, subds. (a), (i).)</p>\n<p id=\"b871-6\">Nowhere in the ballot materials for Proposition 47 were voters given any indication that initiative, which dealt with offenders whose current convictions would now be misdemeanors rather than felonies, had any impact on Proposition 36\u2014enacted a scant two years earlier\u2014which dealt with offenders whose current convictions <em>would still be felonies, </em>albeit not third strikes. For instance, the \u201cOfficial Title and Summary\u201d stated, in pertinent part, that Proposition 47 would \u201c[r]equire[] resentencing for persons serving felony sentences for these offenses [i.e., offenses that require misdemeanor sentences under the measure,] unless court finds unreasonable public safety risk.\u201d (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec., <em>supra, </em>official title and summary of Prop. 47, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"910\">*910</page-number>p. 34.) In explaining what Proposition 47 would do, the Legislative Analyst stated: \u201cThis measure reduces penalties for certain offenders convicted of <em>nonserious and nonviolent property and drug crimes. </em>The measure also allows certain offenders <em>who have been previously convicted of such crimes </em>to apply for reduced sentences.\u201d (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec., <em>supra, </em>analysis of Prop. 47 by Legis. Analyst, p. 35, italics added.) With respect to the resentencing provision, the Legislative Analyst explained: \u201cThis measure allows offenders <em>currently serving felony sentences for the above crimes </em>[i.e., grand theft, shoplifting, receiving stolen property, writing bad checks, check forgery, and drug possession] to apply to have their felony sentences reduced to misdemeanor sentences. In addition, certain offenders who have already completed a sentence for a felony that the measure changes could apply to the court to have their felony conviction changed to a misdemeanor. However, no offender who has committed a specified severe crime could be resentenced or have their conviction changed. In addition, the measure states that a court is not required to resentence an offender currently serving a felony sentence if the court finds it likely that the offender will commit a specified severe crime. Offenders who are resentenced would be required to be on state parole for one year, unless the judge chooses to remove that requirement.\u201d <em>(Id. </em>at p. 36, italics added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b872-4\">Similarly, the arguments in favor of and against Proposition 47 spoke in terms solely of Proposition 47, and never mentioned the Act. The \u201cArgument in Favor of Proposition 47\u201d talked of prioritizing serious and violent crime so as to stop wasting prison space \u201con petty crimes,\u201d stop \u201cwasting money on warehousing people in prisons for nonviolent petty crimes,\u201d and stop California\u2019s overcrowded prisons from \u201cincarcerating too many people convicted of low-level, nonviolent offenses.\u201d (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec., <em>supra, </em>argument in favor of Prop. 47, p. 38.) The \u201cRebuttal to Argument Against Proposition 47\u201d reiterated these themes, and never suggested Proposition 47 would have any effect on resentencing under the Act. (See Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec., <em>supra, </em>rebuttal to argument against Prop. 47, p. 39.) Although the \u201cRebuttal to Argument in Favor of Proposition 47\u201d asserted 10,000 inmates would be eligible for early release under the measure, and that many of them had prior convictions \u201cfor serious crimes, such as assault, robbery and home burglary\u201d (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec., <em>supra, </em>rebuttal to argument in favor of Prop. 47, p. 38), it contained no suggestion the early release provisions would extend to inmates whose current offenses remained felonies under the Act. The same is true of the discussion of resentencing contained in the \u201cArgument Against Proposition 47.\u201d (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec., <em>supra, </em>argument against Prop. 47, p. 39.)</p>\n<p id=\"b872-5\">In light of the foregoing, we cannot reasonably conclude voters intended the definition of \u201c \u2018unreasonable risk of danger to public safety\u2019 \u201d contained in section 1170.18, subdivision (c) to apply to that phrase as it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"911\">*911</page-number>appears in section 1170.126, subdivision (1), despite the former section\u2019s preamble, \u201cAs used throughout this Code . . . .\u201d Voters cannot intend something of which they are unaware.</p>\n<p id=\"b873-5\">We are mindful \u201cit has long been settled that \u2018[t]he enacting body is deemed to be aware of existing laws and judicial constructions in effect at the time legislation is enacted\u2019 [citation], \u2018and to have enacted or amended a statute in light thereof\u2019 [citation], \u2018This principle applies to legislation enacted by initiative.

Thus, we presume voters were aware \u201cunreasonable risk of danger to public safety,\u201d as used in section 1170.126, subdivision (1), had been judicially construed as not being impermissibly vague, but as nevertheless having no fixed definition. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Garcia </em>(2014) 230 Cal.App.4th 763, 769-770 [178 Cal.Rptr.3d 883]; <em>People </em>v. <em>Flores, supra, </em>227 Cal.App.4th at p. 1075.) Because nowhere in the ballot materials for Proposition 47 was it called to voters\u2019 attention the definition of the phrase contained in section 1170.18, subdivision (c) would apply to resentencing proceedings under the Act, we simply cannot conclude voters intended Proposition 47 to alter the Act in that respect.<footnotemark>26</footnotemark> Voters are not asked or presumed to be able to discern all potential effects of a proposed initiative measure; this is why they are provided with voter information guides containing not only the actual text of such a measure, but also a neutral explanation and analysis by the Legislative Analyst and arguments in support of and in opposition to the measure. As we have already observed, none of those materials so much as hinted that Proposition 47 could have the slightest effect on resentencing under the Act. (Cf. <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Pasadena Unified School Dist., supra, </em>119 Cal.App.4th at pp. 1255-1256 [legislative history of enactment included information bill would add definition of particular term to Pub.

The only resen-tencing mentioned in the Proposition 47 ballot materials was resentencing for inmates whose current offenses would be reduced to <em>misdemeanors, </em>not those who would still warrant <em>second strike felony terms. </em>There is a huge difference, both legally and in public safety risked, between someone with multiple prior serious and/or violent felony convictions whose current offense is (or would be, if committed today) a misdemeanor, and someone whose current offense is a felony. Accordingly, treating the two groups differently for resentencing purposes does not lead to absurd results, but rather is eminently logical.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-4\">We recognize it is an established rule of statutory construction \u201cthat when statutes are <em>in pari materia </em>similar phrases appearing in each should be given like meanings.

Unless the legislation was designed or intended to apply retroactively, the definition in section 1170.18(c) cannot apply to defendant. This is the only inquiry we must make to resolve the issue of whether the definition in section 1170.18(c) applies to defendant. However, the majority has opted to determine whether the new definition applies to any resentencing provisions for this or any future petitions under the Act. I respectfully disagree with the majority\u2019s analysis and conclusion on this broader issue. \u201c \u2018When construing a statute, we must \u201cascertain the intent of the Legislature so as to effectuate the purpose of the law.\u201d \u2019 [Citation.] \u2018[W]e begin with the words of a statute and give these words their ordinary meaning.\u2019 [Citation.] \u2018If the statutory language is clear and unambiguous, then we need go no further.\u2019 [Citation.] If, however, the language supports more than one reasonable construction, we may consider \u2018a variety of extrinsic aids, including the ostensible objects to be achieved, the evils to be remedied, the legislative history, public policy, contemporaneous administrative construction, and the statutory scheme of which the statute is a part.\u2019 [Citation.] Using these extrinsic aids, we \u2018select the construction that comports most closely with the apparent intent of the Legislature, with a view to promoting rather than defeating the general purpose of the statute, and avoid an interpretation that would lead to absurd consequences.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Sinohui </em>(2002) 28 Cal.4th 205, 211-212 [120 Cal.Rptr.2d 783, 47 P.3d 629].)</p>\n<p id=\"b877-7\">Where the statutory language is so clear and unambiguous, there is no need for statutory construction or to resort to legislative materials or other outside sources. <em>(Quarterman v. Kefauver </em>(1997) 55 Cal.App.4th 1366, 1371 [64 Cal.Rptr.2d 741].) Absent ambiguity, it is presumed the voters intend the meaning apparent on the face of an initiative measure, and the courts may not add to the statute or rewrite it to conform to a presumed intent not apparent in its language. <em>(People ex rel. Lungren </em>v. <em>Superior Court </em>(1996) 14 Cal.4th 294, 301 [58 Cal.Rptr.2d 855, 926 P.2d 1042].)</p>\n<p id=\"b878-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"916\">*916</page-number>In determining whether the words enacted here are unambiguous, we do not write on a blank slate. For example, in <em>Marshall </em>v. <em>Pasadena Unified School Dist. </em>(2004) 119 Cal.App.4th 1241, 1255 [15 Cal.Rptr.3d 344], the court stated there \u201cis nothing ambiguous about the phrase \u2018as used in this code.\u2019 \u201d It held the definition of \u201c \u2018Emergency,\u2019 as used in this code\u201d applied to the entire Public Contract Code, and it was not limited to a particular chapter, article, or division of that code. <em>(Ibid., </em>italics omitted.) Also, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Bucchierre </em>(1943) 57 Cal.App.2d 153, 166 [134 P.2d 505], the court held: \u201cThe words \u2018as in this code provided\u2019 (Penal Code, \u00a7 182) refer to the Penal Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">In a similar vein, the court in <em>People </em>v. <em>Leal </em>(2004) 33 Cal.4th 999, 1007-1008 [16 Cal.Rptr.3d 869, 94 P.3d 1071], applied the plain meaning rule as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b878-5\">\u201cThe statutory language of the provision defining \u2018duress\u2019 in each of the rape statutes is clear and unambiguous. The definition of \u2018duress\u2019 in both the rape and spousal rape statutes begins with the phrase, \u2018As used in this section, \u201cduress\u201d means . . . .\u2019 (\u00a7\u00a7261, subd. (b), 262, subd. (c).) This clear language belies any legislative intent to apply the definitions of \u2018duress\u2019 in the rape and spousal rape statutes to any other sexual offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-6\">\u201cStarting from the premise that in 1990 the Legislature incorporated into the rape statute a definition of \u2018duress\u2019 that already was in use for other sexual offenses, defendant argues that the Legislature must have intended its 1993 amendment of the definition of \u2018duress\u2019 in the rape statute, and the incorporation of this new definition into the spousal rape statute, to apply as well to other sexual offenses that use the term \u2018duress.\u2019 Defendant observes: \u2018The legislative history does not suggest any rationale for why the Legislature would want its 1993 amendment of the definition of \u201cduress\u201d to apply only to rape so that it would have one meaning when the rape statutes use the phrase \u201cforce, violence, duress, menace, or fear of immediate and unlawful bodily injury\u201d but another, much more expansive meaning when the identical phrase is used in the statutes defining sodomy, lewd acts on a child, oral copulation and foreign object rape.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b878-7\">\u201cBut the Legislature was not required to set forth its reasons for providing a different definition of \u2018duress\u2019 for rape and spousal rape than has been used in other sexual offenses; it is clear that it did so. \u2018When \u201c \u2018statutory language is . . . clear and unambiguous there is no need for construction, and courts should not indulge in it.\u2019 \u201d [Citations.] The plain meaning of words in a statute may be disregarded only when that meaning is \u201c \u2018repugnant to the general purview of the act,\u2019 or for some other compelling reason . . . .\u201d [Citations.]\u2019 [Citation.] As we said in an analogous situation: \u2018It is our task to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"917\">*917</page-number>construe, not to amend, the statute. \u201cIn the construction of a statute ... the office of the judge is simply to ascertain and declare what is in terms or in substance contained therein, not to insert what has been omitted or omit what has been inserted . . . .\u201d [Citation.] We may not, under the guise of construction, rewrite the law or give the words an effect different from the plain and direct import of the terms used.\u2019 [Citation.]\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">The majority pays lip service to the plain meaning rule and then ignores it. While acknowledging the language used is unambiguous, it nonetheless engages in statutory construction to determine whether the electorate really intended to say what it actually enacted. The end result is a rewriting of the statute so that it comports with the majority\u2019s view of what the voters really intended. The majority has rewritten section 1170.18(c) so that it now states: \u201cAy <em>used in this section only, </em>\u2018unreasonable risk of danger to public safety\u2019 means . . . .\u201d The majority does so without providing a compelling reason to do so and without showing the plain language used has a \u201c \u2018meaning [that] is \u201c \u2018repugnant to the general purview of the act.\u2019 \u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Leal, supra, </em>33 Cal.4th at p. 1008.) Because the Act had not previously defined the phrase \u201cunreasonable risk of danger to public safety,\u201d the definition in section 1170.18(c) cannot be repugnant or contradictory to the Act, nor does the majority claim the definition is repugnant to the general purview of Proposition 47. For these reasons, I respectfully disagree with the majority on this part of the opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-6\">I note the Sixth District Court of Appeal in <em>People </em>v. <em>Esparza </em>(2015) 242 Cal.App.4th 726, 734-737 [195 Cal.Rptr.3d 597] has reached the same result as the majority here under nearly identical reasoning. There the court seemingly acknowledges that applying the plain meaning rule would not lead to absurd results. However, like the majority here, the court refused to give the words used their unambiguous, ordinary meaning, stating \u201cwe would need the most compelling proof that the voters intended what we see as an unreasonable and counterintuitive result.\u201d <em>{Id. </em>at p. 737.)</p>\n<p id=\"b879-7\">Subsequently, the Sixth Appellate District, in an opinion authored by one of the justices who concurred in the <em>Esparza </em>decision, reversed position after further reflection and further research on the public debate surrounding the passage of Proposition 47. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Cordova </em>(2016) 248 Cal.App.4th 543, 552, fn. 8 [203 Cal.Rptr.3d 700], review granted Aug. 31, 2016, S236179.) The majority in <em>Cordova </em>extensively outlined in the opinion how the question of whether Proposition 47 could affect petitions under the Act was widely debated in the state by opponents of the measure. <em>(Cordova, supra, </em>at pp. 560-564.)</p>\n<p id=\"b879-8\">The majority here dismisses these sources of information stating, \u201cWe are aware of no California Supreme Court authority identifying Internet and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>media sources as reliable bases for ascertaining voters\u2019 intent.\u201d (Maj. opn., <em>ante, </em>at fn. 26, par. 2, p. 911.) However, the <em>Cordova </em>case cites two such <em>cases\u2014Brosnahan </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(1982) 32 Cal.3d 236 [186 Cal.Rptr. 30, 651 P.2d 274] and <em>Amador Valiev Joint Union High Sch. Dist. v. State Bd. of Equalization </em>(1978) 22 Cal.3d 208 [149 Cal.Rptr. 239, 583 P.2d 1281]\u2014that considered other informative sources on voter intent. Conversely, the majority has cited to no case or authority that confines or otherwise limits the search for voters\u2019 intent to ballot summaries and arguments. I quote from the <em>Brosnahan </em>case:</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">\u201cFinally, petitioners insist that the complexity of Proposition 8 may have led to confusion or deception among voters, who were assertedly uninformed regarding the contents of the measure. Yet, as was the case in both <em>Amador </em>and FPPC<footnotemark>[3]</footnotemark> Proposition 8 received widespread publicity. Newspaper, radio and television editorials focused on its provisions, and extensive public debate involving candidates, letters to the editor, etc., described the pros and cons of the measure. ... [\u00b6] ... [\u00b6]</p>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">\u201cPetitioners\u2019 enhre argument that, in approving Proposition 8, the voters must have been misled or confused is based upon the improbable assumption that the people did not know what they were doing. . . . Rather, in accordance with our tradition, <em>\u2018we ordinarily should assume that the voters who approved a constitutional amendment \u201c. . . have voted intelligently upon an amendment to their organic law, the whole text of which was supplied each of them prior to the election and which they must be assumed to have duly considered.\u201d </em>\u2019 [Citations.]\u201d <em>(Brosnahan v. Brown, supra, </em>32 Cal.3d at pp. 251-252.)</p>\n<p id=\"b880-6\">The majority in <em>Cordova </em>has debunked the arguments relied upon in <em>Esparza </em>and the majority opinion in this case regarding what the voters must have intended based on legislative history and arguments for and against the passage of Proposition 47. However, until further clarification from our California Supreme Court, I rely, as I must, on the plain meaning rule. <em>(People v. Leal, supra, </em>33 Cal.4th at pp. 1007-1008.)</p>\n<p id=\"b880-7\">II. <em>Section 1170.18(c) has no application to defendant\u2019s resentencing under the Act</em></p>\n<p id=\"b880-8\">I do concur in the result because there is nothing in Proposition 47 to indicate the definition enacted under section 1170.18(c) is to be applied retroactively to defendant under the Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>I begin my analysis with section 3 of the Penal Code, which provides that \u2018\u201c[n]o part of it is retroactive, unless expressly so declared.\u201d \u201cWhether a statute operates prospectively or retroactively is, at least in the first instance, a matter of legislative intent. When the Legislature has not made its intent on the matter clear,\u201d section 3 provides the default rule. <em>(People </em>v. <em>Brown </em>(2012) 54 Cal.4th 314, 319 [142 Cal.Rptr.3d 824, 278 P.3d 1182].) Proposition 47 is silent on the question of whether it applies retroactively to proceedings under the Act. The analysis of Proposition 47 by the Legislative Analyst and the arguments for and against Proposition 47 are also silent on this question. (Voter Information Guide, Gen. Elec. (Nov. 4, 2014) pp. 34-39.) Because the statute contains no express declaration that section 1170.18(c) applies retroactively to proceedings under the Act, and there is no clearly implied intent of retroactivity in the legislative history, the default rule applies. Defendant cites <em>In re Estrada </em>(1965) 63 Cal.2d 740 [48 Cal.Rptr. 172, 408 P.2d 948] to argue retroactive application.</p>\n<p id=\"b881-5\">In <em>Estrada, </em>the court stated: \u201cWhen the Legislature amends a statute so as to lessen the punishment it has obviously expressly determined that its former penalty was too severe and that a lighter punishment is proper as punishment for the commission of the prohibited act. It is an inevitable inference that the Legislature must have intended that the new statute imposing the new lighter penalty now deemed to be sufficient should apply to every case to which it constitutionally could apply. The amendatory act imposing the lighter punishment can be applied constitutionally to acts committed before its passage provided the judgment convicting the defendant of the act is not final. This intent seems obvious, because to hold otherwise would be to conclude that the Legislature was motivated by a desire for vengeance, a conclusion not permitted in view of modern theories of penology.\u201d <em>(In re Estrada, supra, </em>63 Cal.2d at p. 745.)</p>\n<p id=\"b881-6\">Defendant argues that under the <em>Estrada </em>case, unless there is a \u201csaving clause\u201d providing for prospective application, a statute lessening punishment is presumed to apply to all cases not yet reduced to a final judgment on the statute\u2019s effective date. <em>(In re Estrada, supra, </em>63 Cal.2d at pp. 744-745, 747-748.) However, the <em>Estrada </em>case has been revisited by our Supreme Court on several occasions. In <em>People </em>v. <em>Brown, supra, </em>54 Cal.4th at page 324, the court stated: <em>\u201cEstrada </em>is today properly understood, not as weakening or modifying the default rule of prospective operation codified in [Penal Code] section 3, but rather as informing the rule\u2019s application in a specific context by articulating the reasonable presumption that a legislative act mitigating the punishment for a particular criminal offense is intended to apply to all nonfinal judgments.\u201d \u201cThe holding in <em>Estrada </em>was founded on the premise that \u2018 \u201c[a] legislative mitigation of the penalty <em>for a particular crime </em>represents a legislative judgment that the lesser penalty or the different treatment is sufficient to meet the legitimate ends of the criminal law.\u201d \u2019 \u201d <em>(Id. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>at p. 325.) In <em>Brown, </em>the court did not apply the <em>Estrada </em>rule because \u201ca statute increasing the rate at which prisoners may earn credits for good behavior does not represent a judgment about the needs of the criminal law with respect to a particular criminal offense, and thus does not support an analogous inference of retroactive intent.\u201d <em>(People </em>v. <em>Brown, supra, </em>at p. 325.)</p>\n<p id=\"b882-4\">Similarly here, <em>Estrada </em>does not control because applying the definition of \u2018\u201cunreasonable risk of danger to public safety\u201d in Proposition 47 to petitions for resentencing under the Act does not reduce punishment for a particular crime.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Instead, the downward modification of a sentence authorized by the Act is dependent not just on the current offense but on any number of unlimited factors related to the individual offender, including criminal conviction history, disciplinary and rehabilitation records, and \u2018\u201c[a]ny other evidence the court, within its discretion, determines to be relevant in deciding whether a new sentence would result in an unreasonable risk of danger to public safety.\u201d (Pen. Code, \u00a7 1170.126, subd. (g)(3).)</p>\n<p id=\"b882-5\">For this reason also, defendant\u2019s argument his equal protection rights would be violated if he is denied retroactive application is unavailing. In light of the unlimited factors related to individual offenders that inform the exercise of discretion, no two individual offenders may be said to be similarly situated for purposes of resentencing under the Act. Defendant fails to establish he has been denied equal protection as against any other similarly situated individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-6\">Because section 1170.18(c)\u2019s definition of \u201c \u2018unreasonable risk of danger to public safety\u2019 \u201d does not apply retroactively to the Act, the sentencing court applied the correct standard in exercising its discretion to not resentence defendant. Since defendant has failed to show an abuse of that discretion, I concur in the majority\u2019s affirmance of the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b882-7\">Appellant\u2019s petition for review by the Supreme Court was granted January 11, 2017, S238790.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b876-11\"> The Safe Neighborhoods and Schools Act (Prop. 47, as approved by voters, Gen.
