For more than seventy years it has developed a world-wide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>business in the manufacture and sale of locks, hardware and other fabricated articles, and many years ago adopted and has since continuously and universally used the word \u201cYale\u201d as its trade mark on its products, identifying such products and its business entirely by the word \u201cYale.\u201d This business has been one of increasing volume, which in the aggregate has amounted to about $300,000,000; in 1929 it was $18,000,000. Its principal office and manufacturing plant is located at Stamford in this State, with branches in other cities both in this country and abroad. It now manufactures approximately fifty thousand different articles and markets them widely throughout the world. A large proportion of the jobbers and .wholesalers in the hardware trade carry and sell its products, and a substantial amount of its business consists in the sale thereof in a large number of cities and towns in this State, and it has been from the start identified with a high type of workmanship and quality. It has registered the word \u201cYale\u201d as its trade mark in the patent office in Washington and in practically every country in the world. This trade mark has been used and stamped upon articles manufactured by it to indicate their origin, and it has prominently displayed the word, not only upon its articles of manufacture, but on the cartons and wrappings thereof and in its catalogs and advertising matter. It is a distinguishing part of its corporate title and has been used in its advertising to the extent of approximately five and one-half million dollars; such advertisements have been widely disseminated throughout the United States and foreign countries, and the general public and the trade have recognized and do recognize its products by the name of \u201cYale\u201d as being of high quality. The right of the plaintiff <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>thus acquired, to use the word \u201cYale\u201d as indicated, is a substantial and valuable right.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">The defendants, Yale Rose and Charles M. Rose, are brothers and own and operate a small store on <em>Front Street </em>in the city of Hartford, in which they retail hardware, house furnishings, plumbing and electrical supplies, wall papers, paints, varnishes and sundry other articles. They commenced business in 1924 on Front Street and at that time filed a certificate of registration of the trade name \u201cYale\u2019s Hardware Store\u201d in the town clerk\u2019s office at Hartford. The trial court found that Yale Rose, the elder of the two brothers, was the \u201cdominating influence in the business.\u201d This is challenged by the appellant, but the evidence justifies this finding as a reasonable inference from the evidence as to the way the business was begun and continued. The defendants have no authority from or connection with the plaintiff, nor any right to use its name in merchandising or marketing hardware. The store is located in a portion of the city which is occupied largely by a foreign-born population, mostly Italian, and its business is almost entirely drawn from this class of people.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">The defendant Yale Rose has been doing business on Front Street since 1910, and before the present store was established, had become known in that vicinity as \u201cYale\u201d and by no other name. The name \u201cYale\u2019s Hardware Store\u201d was adopted in order to identify the store and its location in that part of the city where he was known as \u201cYale.\u201d This latter finding is claimed by the appellant to be without evidence to support ih While it is true it is not stated as a fact in the defendant\u2019s testimony, it does appear that he, being known by the name of \u201cYale,\u201d this name \u201cYale\u2019s Hardware Store\u201d was adopted. It certainly had the effect of indicating that this was Yale Rose\u2019s store and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>in the absence of specific testimony upon this point we deem it a reasonable inference that this was at least one of the purposes for which the name was adopted. There is no evidence of any other purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">The name \u201cYale\u2019s Hardware Store\u201d has been displayed by the defendants upon a sign over the front of the store, and the same name appears in the Hartford telephone directory, and the word \u201cYale\u2019s\u201d appears on their letterhead in slightly larger type over the words \u201cHardware Store.\u201d This letterhead comes to the attention of only such persons as they have occasion to correspond with in their business. Between thirty-five and forty per cent of their business comes to them by orders over the telephone. Most of the customers ask for the article they desire without respect to the maker of the article, and almost none of them specify articles manufactured by any particular concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">The appellant takes exception to the findings of the trial court that the defendants have not sought or intended to mislead the public or any individual into believing that their store is one owned, conducted or authorized by the plaintiff, that plaintiff\u2019s products are sold therein, or to confuse the public in this respect, but that their business has been and is a fair and honest use of the Christian name of Yale Rose to attract business from those who know him by that name. The evidence of record contains no direct testimony bearing upon the defendants\u2019 intentions or motives in employing the name complained of. These intentions and motives are questions of fact. An examination of the pleadings shows that the plaintiff\u2019s complaint charges the defendants with adopting the name \u201cfor no other reason or purpose than to secure for the defendants the value of the good-will and name of the plaintiff,\u201d and that the use of the name \u201cwas <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>done and intended to be done by the defendants in such a way and in such a manner as to be wholly a cause of confusion in the minds of the purchasing public and to induce such public to believe that the store of the defendants was maintained or authorized by the plaintiff and that the plaintiff is responsible for articles sold and services performed therein, to the plaintiff\u2019s damage\u201d and that \u201ceach and all of the acts and doings of the defendants ... are all knowingly and fraudulently designed and calculated to defraud and secure to the defendants the benefit, of the goodwill of the plaintiff\u2019s business and to induce users and purchasers of the locks, keys and hardware and other articles to believe the same to be the business or the well-known product and workmanship of the plaintiff.\u201d Met, as these allegations are, by a general denial iir the answer, a direct question of fact is raised as to the motives of the defendants with the resulting burden of proof upon the plaintiff. The adverse conclusions of the trial court now excepted to are conclusions reached from all the testimony. They amount to a finding that the plaintiff has not sustained its burden of proof in this respect and will be so considered by this court. \u201cThe case stands upon an answer denying the material allegations and claims of the complaint, and in so far as the Superior Court omitted to find true the allegations and claims of the plaintiff, those allegations and claims must be regarded as not proved.\u201d <em>Rogers &amp; Brothers </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>53 Conn. 121, 147, 1 Atl. 807.</p>\n<p id=\"b391-5\">Exception is also taken to the finding of the trial court that while the association of the word \u201cYale\u201d with goods of the type manufactured by the plaintiff and the conjoining of them with the word \u201cHardware\u201d in a business title, would ordinarily have a tendency to confuse the public as contended by the plaintiff, yet <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>the use made of the word \u201cYale\u2019s\u201d by the defendants has not actually done so or caused any injury to the plaintiff, nor is it reasonably probable that it will do so in the future. This likewise is a conclusion reached upon an issue raised by plaintiff\u2019s own affirmative claims and the defendants\u2019 general denial. The complaint alleged that these acts of the defendants were done \u201cto the plaintiff\u2019s great-loss and injury, and to the deception, loss and injury to the public.\u201d The evidence of the plaintiff does not sustain the burden of proof of these allegations and we take the conclusion of the trial court as a finding to that effect. Moreover, it appears from the evidence that this is a small retail store selling many articles in which the plaintiff can have no interest and where the course of dealing indicates clearly that the customers do not ask for the plaintiff\u2019s products as such. In the absence of any evidence of actual confusion or injury, it is not an unreasonable conclusion that this plaintiff corporation has not suffered injury and that the public has not been confused or deceived. The finding does show a single instance where a letter from Louisiana addressed \u201cYale Hardware Company, Hartford, Connecticut\u201d with an accompanying package, was delivered to the defendants\u2019 store but was found by the latter to be intended for the plaintiff and so was promptly forwarded to the plaintiff by them; but that there were many other variously misdirected letters which had been received by the plaintiff. Until the plaintiff received this letter it had never heard of the defendants\u2019 store. This instance shows no confusion of the two names. There is nothing to indicate, and it is in the highest degree improbable, that the sender of the letter ever heard of the defendants\u2019 store. It does not appear that anything the defendants did or failed to do had any relation to the misdirection of this letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>The appellant claims sixteen paragraphs of its draft-finding should be incorporated in the finding. Seven of these are to the effect that the acts of the defendants did in fact tend to confuse and deceive the public. As above stated, the trial court found that while there might be such a tendency if the word \u201cYale\u201d were combined with \u201cHardware Store,\u201d confusion and injury had not in fact taken place as a result of using the word \u201cYale\u2019s\u201d as the defendants had used it. Five of these paragraphs set forth that there was no evidence whatever as to why the defendants\u2019 name was adopted. This claim is covered by what has already been said in considering the finding. The essential portions of the other four paragraphs are already included in the finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-5\">The appellant\u2019s brief clearly states the real issue upon this appeal: \u201cUpon the established facts is the plaintiff entitled to an injunction restraining the defendants from using the word \u2018Yale\u2019s\u201d as part of their adopted trade name \u201cYale\u2019s Hardware Store?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b393-6\">The plaintiff argues and cites many authorities to sustain the proposition that the plaintiff has acquired a right to the use of the word \u201cYale,\u201d and is entitled to enjoin the use of that word in that trade by anyone else whose name is not \u201cYale.\u201d We do not understand that this proposition is disputed. The question here, however, is whether the defendant Yale Rose can use his Christian name \u201cYale\u201d in the possessive form upon this hardware store and otherwise in that business.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-7\">The plaintiff strenuously contends that he has not that right, buttressing the argument with an elaborate citation of authorities. We do not find the general rule as to the use of one\u2019s own name in business, anywhere stated more clearly than in the case of <em>Singer Mfg. Co. </em>v. <em>June Mfg. Co., </em>163 U. S. 169, 187, 16 Sup. Ct. 1002: \u201cThis fact is fully recognized by the well settled doc<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>trine which holds that although \u2018everyone has the absolute right to use his own name honestly in his own business, even though he may thereby incidentally interfere with and injure the business of another having the same name. In such case the inconvenience or loss to which those having a common right are subjected is damnum absque injuria. But although he may thus use his name, he cannot resort to any artifice or do any act calculated to mislead the public as to the identity of the business firm or establishment, or of the article produced by them, and thus produce injury to the other beyond that which results from the similarity of name.\u2019 . . . Where the name is one which has previously thereto come to indicate the source of the manufacture of particular devices, the use of such name by another, unaccompanied with any precaution or indication, in itself amounts to an artifice calculated to produce the deception alluded to in the foregoing adjudications.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-5\">In <em>Horlick\u2019s Malted Milk Corporation </em>v. <em>Horluck\u2019s, Inc., </em>59 Fed. (2d) 13, 15, the rule is stated in this wise: \u201cAs a general proposition, a person has a right to use his own name in connection with any business which he carries on honestly. . . . But where a personal name has become associated in the minds of the public with certain goods or a particular business, it is the duty of the person with the same or similar name, subsequently engaging in the same or similar business or dealing in like goods, to take such affirmative steps as may be necessary to prevent his goods or business from becoming confused with the goods or business of the established trader.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b394-6\">The rule as thus stated limits the right of one in the use of his own name in business somewhat more strictly than in the early decisions in this State which undoubtedly conformed to the generally accepted <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>judicial view of that time. Thus in <em>Rogers &amp; Brothers </em>v. <em>Rogers, </em>supra, at page 156, we said: \u201cThe cases seem to require some element of false representation other than that implied in the fair, honest and ordinary use of a person\u2019s own name. An examination of the following and kindred cases wherein the use of a person\u2019s name has been regulated, will show that in most instances conscious, intentional fraudulent misrepresentation on the part of the defendant has been resorted to; in others, there was such a combined use of the name with other marks, characteristics, figures, or form and arrangement of circulars, advertisements, etc., as to amount to a false representation, and the combination only was enjoined. No instance can be found where the use of the name only, in good faith, has been stopped. . . . Upon the other hand there has been, from the first to the present time, a general consensus of judicial opinion that the use of a personal name in a fair, honest and ordinary business manner, could not be prevented, even if damage resulted therefrom,\u201d citing many cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b395-4\">The trend of judicial opinion toward a greater strictness in the rule was noted in the case of <em>Waterman Co. </em>v. <em>Modern Pen Co., </em>235 U. S. 88, 35 Sup. Ct. 91, where, at page 94, the court said: \u201c. . . the defendant lays hold of language in <em>Howe Scale Co. </em>v. <em>Wyckoff, Seamans &amp; Benedict, </em>198 U. S. 118 [25 Sup. Ct. 609], and in other books, to the effect that courts will not interfere with the use of a party\u2019s name 'where the only confusion, if any, results from a similarity of the names and not from the manner of the use.\u2019 But whatever generality of expression there may have been in the earlier cases, it now is established that when the use of his own name upon his goods by a later competitor will and does lead the public to understand that those goods are the product of a concern already <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>established and well known under that name, and when the profit of the confusion is known to and, if that be material, is intended by the later man, the law will require him to take reasonable precautions to prevent the mistake.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b396-5\">Our own recognition of this tendency to a stricter rule is illustrated by the more recent case of <em>Middletown Trust Co. </em>v <em>Middletown National Bank, </em>110 Conn. 13, 147 Atl. 22, wherein we held that we could not say as matter of law that the consequences alleged by the plaintiff if established by proof could not be such as to entitle it to relief; that whether the results feared by the plaintiff were justified and their rights invaded was a question of fact to be decided on the evidence. \u201cNo inflexible rule can be laid down as to what use of names will constitute unfair competition; this is a question of fact.\u201d (p. 20) The rule thus stated in the foregoing decisions is not perhaps strictly applicable to the present case because the name \u201cYale\u201d is a first name, while the business is not that of Yale Rose alone, yet the rule serves to indicate in general the right of a man to the use of his own name for the store in the absence of proof of such facts as would justify relief to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-6\">The position we have taken and to which we adhere is that the condition of a plaintiff's right to an injunction in a case of this kind depends upon the proof of the allegations of his complaint as to the consequences of the use of the name in question by a defendant. The importance of this feature of the case has led us to refer to the finding at some length. As that finding stands it is apparent that neither the plaintiff's charges of fraudulent and improper motives nor the allegations of actual injury to the plaintiff and confusion to the public, are sustained.</p>\n<p id=\"b396-7\">Possibly anticipating this result, the appellant has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>filed a supplementary brief, basing its claim upon a proposition stated in Nims on Unfair Competition: \u201cActs constituting a threat to good will. A defendant\u2019s course of conduct which, while not resulting in immediate injury to the plaintiff\u2019s business, nevertheless constitutes a threat or menace to the plaintiff\u2019s goodwill, may be enjoined. ... In such a case, it is not essential for the plaintiff to show actual damage.\u201d Nims (3d Ed.) \u00a7 16a.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-5\">The defendants contend that under the complaint and answer in the present case the issues are confined to improper motive on the part of the defendants and a resulting actual confusion and injury to the public and to the plaintiff. Without discussing the validity of that contention we recur to the finding as explained and amplified in the memorandum of decision. The facts there appear that the defendants\u2019 store is a small and comparatively obscure establishment; that it sells many other articles than those in which the plaintiff is interested; that only the possessive form of the word \u201cYale\u201d is used on the store or elsewhere; that it is obviously intended to show only that that store is the one at which the defendant Yale Rose is doing business; that the word \u201cYale\u2019s\u201d was not used as a label for goods of any kind and could not reasonably be so understood, but its only purpose was to mark the store as such; that there can be no competition in manufacture because the defendants do not manufacture and the plaintiffs are not retail dealers; that the defendants have no inquiry for the plaintiff\u2019s goods as such; and that its customers are not interested in the name of the manufacturer. These and other features of the case to which we might refer make it clear to us that the use which is made by the defendants of the possessive form of the name \u201cYale\u201d cannot reasonably be said to constitute a threat or menace to the good<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>will of the business of the plaintiff, and the trial court was justified in finding facts which negative this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">This result renders it unnecessary- to discuss any of the subordinate issues raised by briefs of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-5\">Upon the whole record, we concur in the conclusion which the trial court reached, that as the word \u201cYale\u2019s\u201d is now used by the defendants, no dishonest purpose or ulterior motive on their part has been established and that there has not been and cannot reasonably be expected to be any unfair competition with or injury to the plaintiff or deceiving of the public or threat to the plaintiff\u2019s good-will.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-6\">There is no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">In this opinion the other judges concurred.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
