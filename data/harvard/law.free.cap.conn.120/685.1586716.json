While he was trying to separate the two cars, the defendant ran into the rear of his car and as a result he suffered the injuries to recover for which he brought this action. The plaintiff's car was stopped about seventy-five feet westerly of a curve in the street and the defendant could not see it until he rounded this curve. The street was not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"686\">*686</page-number>slippery to the east of the curve, but starting just westerly of it and continuing beyond the spot where the plaintiff\u2019s car stood it was icy. The defendant was going at a speed of twenty miles an hour as he came around the curve. On seeing the plaintiff\u2019s car he immediately applied his foot brake, but because the street was icy this reduced his speed only to ten miles an hour. When within about forty or forty-five feet of the plaintiff\u2019s car, he blew his horn and applied his emergency brake, but due to the icy condition of the street the car continued forward and skidded into the rear of the plaintiff\u2019s automobile, proceeding then at a speed of about seven miles an hour. The defendant could not turn his car to the left without danger of colliding with two cars coming in the opposite direction nor was there room to pass the plaintiff\u2019s car on the right. Upon these facts the conclusion of the trial court that the defendant was not negligent was one which it could reasonably reach.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-5\">There is no error.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
