oper-'tlon of street cars in the City of Hew Orleans^and said o?rs opere bed by eleccricityj and represents that on or about June 13th, 191S, at about eight o'clock in the morning, one of the employees of plaintiff attempted to cross the traoks of defendant at Tulsne Avenue and Cortez Street, when he was struok by a oar of the defendant, in charge of one of its employees^and further representing that the truck of pis intiff was driven in a lawful and careful mr\u00bfnner when it attempted to cross the street and thst defendant'e oar -,vas far enough away to permit it to pass in safety if said oar had been operated in a lawful and careful manner^end that its said truck was in plain view of the motorman of the 3\u00abld oar^who knew or should have known that owing to the b=d condition of the street at that point it was necessary to drive slowly and carefully across their track^but that the motorman operated and continued to operate the oar at such an unlaviful and excessive rate of speed and made no attempt to stop said car until it was too late to avoid striking the truck of plaintiff and alleging further thst the damage accruing to said \\ due to truck was entirely/the fault and negligence of defendant's mo-torraan^and not to the driver of the truokj damages in the sum of One Hundred Sixt\u00edP-six and 65/100 Dollars are claimed and judgment for that amount prayed for.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-7\">Defendant's answer oontends, after denying all the allegations of plaintiff's petition, except suoh as ware ad-averred mitted,/ that the accident happened and was oaused entirely by the negligence of plaintiff's employee who failed to stop, look and listen before attempting to cross said traok^and further plead contributory hegligenoe and prayed for a
