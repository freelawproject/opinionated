If the objeot adjudged is an immovable for whioh the law requires that the aot of sale shall be passed in writing, ths purchaser may retain the prioe, and the seller the possession of the thing, until the aot be passed. This aot Ought to be passed within twenty four hours after the adjudication if one of the parties require itj he who oooasaions a further delay is responsible to the other feu in damages.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b208-7\">We are of the opinion that the plaintiff's rule did disclose a oause of aotion, under the Artiole quoted. If the sale took plaoe on August 5th, and the aot was passed on November 15th 1930, a period exo-.eding three months, it is evident that the purohaser suffered a damage represented by the rent due for that period, provided that the delay was oaused by the fault of the Succession representatives, and that it oould have been avoided by reasonable dlligenoe on their part,- and was not oaused by the ordinary and necessary oerclfioatea, dooumant3 and proofs preoesding aots of sals, nor by the requirements of the purohaser. For that purpose evidence should have been heard to show that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>the vendors were not at fault or that the purohaser V\u00edas at fault, or, in the language of the Artiole, to establish who it was who oooassioned the further and avoidable delay in order to make him i3sp bear the demages oaused by the delay. When the condition of sale provides that the purohaser shall be entitled to rents only from and after the signing of the aot of sale, the conditions means that the purohaser shall not be entitled to rents during the ordinary delays neoessary and inoidental to the passage and signing of the aot of sale; the Courts oannot be ashed to interpret suoh a olaim as meaning that the vendors have the right at their pleasure to procrastinate unnecessarily the passing of the aot, and to appropriate the rents, to the injury of the pur-ohaser.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-3\">It is therefore ordered, that the judgment herein be reversed and set aside, that the exceptions of no cause of aotioi be dismissed, and that this rule be reinstated to be tried and determined upon any other issues and in aaoordanoe with the views hereinabove expressed, the oosts of this appeal to be paid by the heirs of Mrs. Braughn end the oosts of the Distriot Oo.urt to await the final judgment herein.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-4\">-Exception overruled and oa3e remanded.-</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
