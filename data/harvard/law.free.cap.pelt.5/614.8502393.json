V\u00edUiLIMI <em>A. </em>BEED, JUDGE:</author>\n<p id=\"b627-2\">The plaintiff as Beneficiary under an insurance policy issued on the life of her deoeased husband, for' the sum of -$2,000, sues defendant for said amount. Erom an adverse judgment, plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-3\">There is no contention as to the material faots mainly disclosed by documentary evidence. Testimony'by de-' positions taken on behalf of the defendant, is found upon examination to be of little value save to establish the dates upon which certain premium payments were made by George Clinton Mbutoji, the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-4\">The policy in question is an ordiAary life insurance and investment policy in effect as of January 15, 1906, upon which date the first annual premium of $106.82 was paid. The insured also made two other premium payments, of iike amounts, one on January 15, 1907, and another on January 15, 1908. On the due \u2019 date of the fourth annual premium, to wit: January 15, 1909, same was not paid. Under the terms of the policy it \u00edb provided that one insured at age \"62,years\" (Houton's age) having paid premiums for three years, as did he, and having defaulted in payment of premium for the fourth.year, the insurance would be extended one year and four months from date of default.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">These faots all having arisen in the 'instant <em>aA </em>case, it follows^an indisputable fact that the policy; under term insurance, was extended automatically to May 15) 1910. It also appears from the provisions of the policy that had the insured paid the fourth annual premium on January 15, 1909, and defaulted in payment on the fifth annual payment, to wit: January 16, .1910, that Vhe'policy would have been extended automatically as term Insurance, one year and eleven months from date of the default \u00f3n the fifth premium payment, or, in other words, that the policy would not have terminated except by ad interim death of the.insured,until Hovember 15, 1911.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">There is no authentic proof in the record of the insured's death, but plaintiff, by supplemental petition, alleges the same to have occurred on October 24, 1911. It is oon-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"616\">*616</page-number>olusively proven that no other premium payments were ever made, save the three heretofore stated, and that the insured defaulted in his payments on the fourth, fifth and sixth annual premiums falling due respeotively on January 16, 1909, January 16, 1910, and January 16, 1911.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-2\">It is contended, however, and,the plaintiff so alleges, that the fourth premium payment was paid on its due date, to wit:- January 16, 1909, in cash, \u00a1$S6.82, and hy oertain note of the insured for $79.00. Upon this allegation - not home out hy the faots as we find them - it is argued that though no other premiums were subsequently paid, the automatic term insurance as stipulated in the policy extended the life of the policy to November 16, 1911 - a period bdyond the death of the insured.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-3\">The sole issue for determination is whether the transaction above referred to, 'and which occurred between the insured and the defendant, on January 16, 1909, in any manner effected the contract of insurance herein sued upon. Defendant admits that the policy was dated January 16, 1906 (not January 16, 1907, nor February 16, 1907, as alleged in plaintiff's petition and supplemental petition) but denies that premiums were paid for four years. It further alleges that three premiums were paid carrying the policy to January 15, 1909, the due date of the fourth premium payment, but denies that any part of the fourth premium was ever paid by cash or note, though in fact, it did, on January 16, .1909, reoeive from George Clinton Mouton, the insured, $26.82 in cash, under and in accordance 'with a certain written contraot or agreement known as a \"blue note,\" reading as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-4\">\"Bol.No.2266228 Rayne.Ia., 1/16,1909.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b628-5\">ON OR BEFORE July 16, 1909, after- date, without grace, and without demand or notice, I promise to pay to the order of the NBW-YOBE LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY, SEVENTY-NINE Dollars at Tihitney-Central National Bank, New Orleans, Da., value received, with'interest at the rate of five per cent per annum.

Toombs, Cashier.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">There being no dispute that the signature attached to the original note, as above described, is that of the insured, the admission or declaration therein made to the effect \"that no part of the premium due on January 15, 1909 has Reen paid,\" is conclusive of this all important fact,', and in the absence of allegations ana proof of fraud or error, same cannot Re questioned by one claiming under the policy. It follows, therefore, that there could not have Reen any automatic term insurance extending the policy to Bovemb'er 15, 1911, or until death of the insured on October 15, 1911, unless - despite the declarations contained in the note - it can Re held that the payment of the cash and the giving -of the ' note was'a payment in full of the fourth premium due January 16,190,9.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-9\">Suoh construction would Re abhorrent to the law of the contract as stipulated in the' policy which specifically provides that the insurance will automatically continue \"if there is no indebtedness to the Company.\" a fact definitely declared to the contrary in the note itself</p>\n<p id=\"b631-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"619\">*619</page-number>The contention of plaintiff by 'Which recovery is sought, can only he predicated upon the theory of novation under Revised Civil Code, Art, 2185, whereby an existing obligation is substituted by a new one in its place, but this can occur only where the old debt is extinguished by the new, and the intention so to do clearly results from the terms of the agreement, fully discharging the original debt. Such intention cannot be presumed. Rev. P.C. Arts. 2187,2189,2190. As just observed, there was not only no express intention to novate the obligation due for the fourth premium of insurance, but special declarations in the \"blue note\" and the reoeipt therefor clearly pronounoe against such intention.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-3\">Counsel for plaintiff cites with confidence the decision of Lawrence v. Penn Mutual Life Insurance, 113 La. 87, as authority against an insurance company's accepting a note in payment of a first premium, and subsequently forfeiting the policy or treating it as null without notifying xhe insured that such has been done because of his failure to meet the note at maturity. She facts in the cited case are clearly not applicable to conditions which have arisen in the instant case, particularly for the reason that in the \"blue note\" signed by Mouton, it is provided in most positive and unambiguous language as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-4\">\"Shat said Company has duly given every notice required by its rules or by the laws of any State in respect to said premium, and in further compensation for the rights and privileges hereby granted, the maker hereof has agreed to waive, and does hereby waive every other notice in 'respect to said premium or this note, it being well understood by said maker that said Company would not have accepted this agreement if any notice of any kind were required as a condition to the full enforcement of all its terms.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">In Lawrence v. Penn Mutual Life Insurance Co., it is plainly indicated what the ruling would have been had the facts there been similar to those now before us, for the Court said even in that ease, the following, viz:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b631-6\">\"If the company takes it as its own and approves his act, it is to be viewed in the light of having possession of a note which it accepted in payment of premium due on the policy. Unless it be stipulated in the policy, or in some way in the contract of insurance, that forfeiture is to be immediate in event <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"620\">*620</page-number>the note is not paid, no such result can follow its. non-payment. She power to forfeit or cancel must he 'nominated in the hond.' Here no such consequence was stipulated.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b632-2\">She judgment of the trial court dismissing plaintiff's petition is justified hy abundant authority found in the jurisprudence of the highest courts of other states, where similar notes under like conditions have been construed as in no manner qualifying the terms or conditions of the original contract of insurance stipulated in the policy. - White v. N.Y.Life Insurance Co., 200 Mass. 512; Holly v. Metropolitan Ins. Co. 105 N.Y. 437; Baker v. Union Insurance Co., 43 N.Y. 283; Bank of Commerce v. New York Insurance Co., 125 Ga. 522; Slocum v.
