S. FIDELITY Sc GUARANTY CO., Appellant. vs CHARLES MAUTHE</p>\n<p id=\"b483-4\">No. 8249</p>\n<author id=\"b483-7\">CHARLES F. CLAMOME, JUDffl.</author>\n<p id=\"AAe\">The plaintiff, having issued its policy in favor of Victor E. Hymel, to indemnify him for any damage to his automobile, and having paid $352.59 damages resulting from a collision of Hymel's automobile with that of the defendant, Mauthe, and claiming a subrogation to all the rights of Hymel against Mauthe, sues the latter for $352.59.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-9\">The plaintiff alleges that on or about April 19th, 1920 Hymel was driving his car down St. Charles Avenue, on the lake side road of the Avenue, owing to the fact that the river side road was undergoing repairs; that near Louisiana Avenue he met with the following accident: that Hymel was proceeding behind a truck at about eight miles an hour, when the truck turned into a side street; that Charles Mauthe, who was driving his car up St. Charles Avenue towards his left instead of his right, negligently ran into Hymel's car and damaged it to the extent of $352.59 which plaintiff paid for him; and that by the teims of the policy the plaintiff is subrogptel to the rights of Hymel against Mauthe.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-10\">Defendant simply denied each and every allegation in plaintiff's petition contained.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-11\">There was judgment for defendant and plaintiff has appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b483-12\">The evidence is that plaintiff was driving down St. Charles Avenue in his automobile; he was driving on the side of the road towards the Lake because the side t-owafds the River <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>was undergoing repairs; he was driving to the right of the road within a foot or two of the neutral ground; in the car with him vfere his wife and child and a friend R. A. Dubroca. Ahead of them was a truck loaded with cotton. \\7heh they reached Josephine Street, the truck turned to its left into Josephine Street. Plaintiff's car had not at that moment reached Josephine Street; it was about twenty or thirty feet from it. At that moment plaintiff's car collided with defendant's. Plaintiff was on the right side of the roadway where he should have been, while defendant was on the left side where he had no right to be. This is the testimony of the plaintiff and of his friend Dubroca. They are corroborated by Jesso K. Rea a witness for the defendant who says;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-2\">Q. How long after the accident did you get there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-3\">A. 1 suppose about two or three minutos.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-4\">Q. Where was Mr. Kauthe's automobile when you first 3a\\v it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-6\">A. Comer St. Charles and Josephine, facing going uptown.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-7\">Q. Was it near the neutral ground?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-8\">A. I Souldn't say. When I saw it, it was in the middle of the street about on the intersection of St.Charles and Josephine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-9\">Q. But taking St. Charles Avenue.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-10\">A. Right about the corner post, at the neutral ground. That was after they hit. 1 don't know whether they v/ere rolled or anything, how far it was dragged after it was hit.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-11\">Q. Is that the back or front of the automobile that war at the comer?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-12\">A. The front.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b484-13\">The plaintiff was asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-14\">Q. On what side of the automobile did your automobile <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>come in contact with Mr. Hauthe's machine?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-2\">A. On the right side of my machine.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-3\">Q. The right side of your machine hit the left side of his?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AOU\">A. Ho; he hit right square in the front.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-4\">Q. Now with regard to the neutral ground and the sidewalk, where did this accident take place?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-5\">A. Eight close to the neutral ground.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-6\">Q. Eow far from the neutral ground were you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-7\">A. 7/ell, about one and a half or two feet; running very close.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">In weighing the testimony of this witness we must remember that he had no pecuniary interest in the result as the repairs had been paid by the insurance company; while the defendant was testifying to shield himself from responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-9\">Dubrooa did not have the ben\u00e9fit of Hymel's testimony, because, at the inception of the trial,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-10\">\"at the request of counsel for defendant, the witnesses in this case were ordered to retire from the court-fcoom until called\".</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-11\">He says that when the accident happened Hymel's car</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-12\">\"was within a foot of the curb, right near the curb, on his right\".</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-13\">Bert Hayes, a witness for defendant, who took Hauthe's car to the shop, being asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-14\">Q. Are you the one who repaired it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-15\">A. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-16\">Q. On what side of the oar was the damage done?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-17\">A. I think on the right hand side of the car. I am not positive, it is so long ago.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-18\">The defendant thus testifies:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-19\">\"Both traffic was using the same street; as I got wo the comer, about eight or ten feet, there was a big cotton flop.t with cotton. As he was coming down it aopeared he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>forgot he had to go out Josephine, and made a quick sharp turn, all I could do to stop, I wasn\u2019t going fast, but I just about stooped. Y/hen the big cotton float turned out Josephine Street, ma.de a quick turn, I was afraid he would drag me with him, right behind him was this Paige car. I was just possibly, at a standstill, I can't say, but I was moving very little if at all, and the Paige car, the left hand side of it, struck the left hand side of my car, removed my fender, my left light, and ploughed into my radiator. I was on the lakeside of St. Charles Avenue near the curto, possibly four or five feet from the curb, and in the middle of Josephine Street\".</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b486-2\">If the defendant means to say that he was traveling on the right side of the road, and that, while there, the left hand side of plaintiff's car struck the left hand side of his car, he is contradicted by the plaintiff and his guest, and especially by the witness Hayes who took his car to the shop and repaired it.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-3\">\u2019fe rise from a. critical examination of the whole testimony with the conviction that the plaintiff was driving down the street on the right side near the curb, where he should have been. That the defendant occupied one of two positions: either he was drivirg up the street, on the left side of the road near the neutral ground, where he had no right to travel, or, driving on the right hand side, when he reached Josephine Street, and saw the track blocking his advance he swerved to the left to pass the track, and thus threw himself into the way of plaintiff's car. In both positions he violated the traffic ordinances, and, according to several decisions rendered by us, made himself liable for any damage caused thereby. Joseph vs Orleans Ice Man'g. Co. No. 8232.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">In order to reconcile defendant's testimony with the facts, an attempt was made, in argument, to say that while defendant was running up the street, he was surprised by \u00a3he truck suddenly turning into Josephine Street, across his path, and that, in order <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>to save himself from imminent danger and harm, he as suddenly, swerved to the left to avoid the truck and thus collided with plaintiff's car, and that the accident was not the fault of either the plaintiff or the defendant, but was the fault of the absent other party, the trupk. No such defense was made in the answer, which certainly would have been made if it had conformed to the facts. No such testimony or explanation was given by defendant. One the contrary, he denied it.

Did you afempt to run in towards the neutral gsraund, to pass the float?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-5\">A. No, sir, I couldn't. There wasn't time enough to do it. All I could say, the vibration of my car was so str.ong as I was trying to stop.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-6\">Q. And you say you Viere going eight miles an hour.

I did when he bounded off, I couldn't come to a dead stop, but I tried my best to stop.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-8\">Prior to filing his answer, the defendant had pleaded that plaintiff's petition disclosed no cause and no right of action- The plea was based on'the ground that plaintiff, Hymel, had no right to transfer his claim to the Insurance Company, because</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b487-9\">\"this isra suit for the recovery of damages and is not transferable\".</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b487-11\">No authority is quoted in support of the exception, and we know of none. It is said that the effect of the transfer is to deprive the defendant of his right to reconvene. But if the defendant suffered any damages he may bring a direct suit. 0. C. 2642' (2612) authorizes the transfer of all credits or claims, without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>exception. The validity of transfers of damage claims by the insured to the insurer aften payment of loss by the latter bs,s been recognized in Haviton vs N. O. Light &amp; Power Co. 124 La. 562.

Again the defendant quotes no autnority. The trial Court properly overruled the objection. As to the date, the petition alleged that it v\u00edas</p>\n<blockquote id=\"As3\">\"on or about April 19th\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b488-8\">which sufficiently indicates the accident declared upon, as there was only one accident. The comer of the street was not of the essence of the suit, and the defendant was not taken by aurorise.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b488-9\">\"Though the allegations be indefinite and informal, yet, if from the pleadings or proceedings before trial the opposite pary has sufficient notice of the nature of the demand or defense to be advanced and could not be surprised evidence thereof will be received!!. 2 H.
