\u25a0agreed prioe of $17.50 per ton, the oopper sorap at sixteen bents per pound and the brass sorap at thirteen oents per pound; there were shipped to defendants three oars of mixed sorap and four barrels of mixed brass and oopper sorap. The allegations of the petition go on ta assert that defendants paid for two of the oars of mixed sorap but never paid for the balanoe, hence they prayed for Judgment in the full sum of $444.76.</p>\n<p id=\"b685-3\">The- answer and-'reoonventional demand of the defendants admit that they bought a oertain lot of mixed sorap from plaintiff, but deny that the amdunt in question olaimed by plaintiff was owing by them, but assert the faot to be that on or before February 18th, 1920, they purchased from plaintiff a oertain lot of mixed sorap material whioh was looated at Eunloe, Louisiana, for the prioe and sum of $17.50 per ton\u00a1 that under said oontraot plaintiff shipped them some of the sorap material, for whioh they paid, and alleging further that plaintiff contrary to their obligations under the said oontraot and in violation of its duty thereunder, separated from the said lot of sorap material, the sorap oast, whioh was the most valuable part of the lot, and sold same for $33.00 per ton, refusing to mete any further shipments from the said lot to them. That defendants were entitled to an accounting showing the proceeds of sale of the sorap oast made by plaintiff, and all othl er material comprised in the said lot of mixed sorap or otherwise disposed of by plaintiff in violation and breach of their oontraot with defendant, and therefore defendant is entitled to recover from plaintiff the difference between the proceeds of such sales and the oonvraot prioe of #17.50 per ton. Finally they pray that plaintiffs suit be dismissed at their costs and that plaintiff be ordered to account herein to defendants for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"674\">*674</page-number>the proceeds of the afile of seid scrap cast end all other materiel amas? comprised in the seid lot of mixed scrap wrongfully converted end sold or otherwise disposed of by plaintiff, and defendants deducting the amount alleged to ha due plaintiff, whioh they state to be \u00a7343.79, in reconvention pray for a judgment for b*lance due them by plaintiff of \u00a7943.31.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-2\">An examination of this record gees to show th'-'t in the esrly part of February, 1930, the plant of the Eunice Ice and Power Company burned and thair aff-iirs wer^ taken ov--r by three liquid--tors, who are the plaintiff? and appellee:? herein.

On the advice of his oo-liquide.tor, Mr. Smith, he went over end hid e talk with 2ir. iferx speaking to him about this miscellaneous scrap snd asked again for a price, and referring.to his files, Hr. Marx made him the same price that he had made in his letter. He then ssked Mr. \u00edfer\u00e1 about the machinery, if he was interested in it and he said no; on account of the machinery having been through a fire he was not interested in it .without first having seen it, and asked if I would make a price on o piece of machinery separately he would go and look at it end ifxhxxx after he examined it would let me know whether he was interested in itor not; he also asked me whether I would be interested in some ice .machinery that he was interested in, and I answered him no, all that we wanted was to get rid of' what we had and I told him 1 would ship a bt-r or two of miscellaneous sorap which-I had, and would sse further about the heavy maohinery, which X oould not be positive I oo\u00fcld sorap; I vfented to sell it as heavy mechineryif X could, he never did make a prioe of any kind on the heavy stuffjat the time of that meeting he asked me particularly whether there was jsny good pipe in this lot of miscellaneous sorap and after I hs-d told him that the best of it would be pipes I told him I did npt think there would be much good pipe, that it was mostly burned, warped end bent from the fire, and he \u2022\u2022remarked that that did not make any difference as long as it would stay in the oar, and they would out it up, ,as long as there was no sheet iron or galvanized material or badly rusted light iron in it it was all right. Xhats about all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"677\">*677</page-number>there was to the conversa-t\u00fcon and I told him I would ship what there w=s and also the oopper end brass, which was done.

The entire record, taking it as s either or orally \u25a0whole, convinces us that there was no oontraot^in -writing/and thet the several shipments prior to the lust one, handled by the defend-ancs, ware paid for .tk by them, and after the list shipment had been reoeived, they then apted that the shipments did not come up to their expectations, their testimony being based on past experiences; whilst on th\u00ab other h-nd the testimony of the liquid\u00bb tor-, in this o&amp;se is hxjran\u00e1 convincingly to the effect that the goods sent to defendants ware undeniably the same to vrhioh there were no objec-.i- ns by the defendant a-t th? time of the inspecci\u00f3n, and.us seated heretofore until finel payment there '(\u25a0;-\u2022\u00a3 no objection \"t C11 m-de by defendants.
