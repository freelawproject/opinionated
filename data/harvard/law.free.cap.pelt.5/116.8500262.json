label=\"117\">*117</page-number>Dinkelspiel, J.</author>\n<p id=\"b129-2\">Plaintiff Institutes this suit to recover the sum of $450.00, plus twenty five per cent attorney's fees, under a oontraot said to have been made between him and the defendant, authorizing plaintiff to sell oertain real estate and to pay him in lieu of the commission of five per cent, all of the excess of the purohase price, over the sum of $4500.00. Further alleging that pSaintiff in every particular carried out and confirmed to all the covenants and considerations as agreed and whioh form the basis of the transaction whioh oa.uses this suit, and for whioh he is entitled to a judgment for the amount prayed.</p>\n<p id=\"b129-4\">The answer in the main sets up that defendant was suffering at the time that the signature,whioh is admitted, to the dooumsnt, in question, with defective eyesight and unable to read without glasses, ths.t when the document dated April 15th, 1918, was signed by the defendant, it was presented to him by plaintiff, that defendant wcs without gls3-ses and that he informed the plaintiff that he we 3 uneble to read s'.me \u00bfnd th-1 the plaintiff pretended to read to the defendant the terms incorporated in ssid agreement and at the time plaintiff read the se-id agreement 30 as to make it e pper.r that he was to receive an excess of eny price otfer Fifty Five Hundred Dollars; end that plaintiff fraudulently end intentionally misread the said document, or subsequently substituted the figures $4500.00 in lieu of \u00a75500.00. And averring further that said a.ooept'-noe of s-id offer by s? id purchaser, Cerroll, who purchased the property for \u00a75100.00 end that plaintiff agreed to reduce his commission by one hundred dollars, th't st the time of th3 acceptance of the offer by Carroll, olsintiff u?ds no claim for an exoess of commission end the aoceptenos was bsssd <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"118\">*118</page-number>upon a oommisaion of five per cent; that th8 xeduotlon in the prioe of said property was due to a deficiency in measurement. That said plaintiff received the sum of Five Hundred and Fifty Dollars from said Carroll, whioh he has refused to aooount for, and that he was entitled to a commission of five per cent on $5500.00, less one hundred dollars whioh he had agreed to forego, or a total of One Hundred Seventy Five Dollars} that he is therefore indebted unto your defendant for the xmiaiaiai remaining Three Hundred Seventy Five Dollars. Alleging further that on account of defective eyesight, whilst admitting his signature to the document sued on, avers that the figures $4500.00 were fraudulently inserted therein in lieu of $5500.00 and finally assuming the character of plaintiff in zKaEsiintienatJE dtec reoonvention, prays that the demand of plaintiff be dismissed and defendant have judgment in reoonvention for Three Hundred Seventy Five Dollars.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-2\">The questions presented are almost entirely based upon the testimony of ple-intiff, together with the documents attached and that of his counsel, Hr. Perez.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-3\">Plaintiff's testimony substantially is in accord more or less, with the allegations in his petition, he swears \u2022positively that the defendant signed the document appointing him, plaintiff, as the agent to sell this property; that he had his glasses on before signing;that he read every word air'd after reeding deliberately signed same.</p>\n<p id=\"b130-4\">Mr. Perez, his counsel,supports him in that portion of his testimony whioh simply asked for instructions in reference to the document and sundry other matters connected therewith and he, Mr. Perez, being ill at the time, gave certain adyioe to the plaintiff, but in no wise tendered to aid ns in the determination of the real questions in this esse.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"119\">*119</page-number>un una other hand we have the testimony of the defendant end his wife, who positively swear that the defendant did not heve his glasses vb the time the agreement in question w?b presented to him; that seme was read by the plaintiff to him --nd thc-t he signed under representations made to him by the plaintiff, particularly in reference to his commission as to five per cent on the amount of the sale or whether or not he, plaintiff, was to receive the entire difference between Forty Five Hundred Dollars and whatever the property may have brought and especially denying that there ever was an intention on the part of the defendant to pay him anything beyond the five per cent commission, no matter what the property in question might have brought.</p>\n<p id=\"b131-2\">Independent and irrespective of the testimony of defendant end his wife, we have in this reoord the testimony of the purchaser of this property, Hr. Charles C-.rroll, s. respected member of the Bsx of this city, who dealt entirely with the plaintiff s-nd gives his testimony as to the occurrences from time to time from the beginning of the transaction until its final oonolusion and in answer to the question to state just whs.t dealings he had with Hr. Harvey with reference to the trs-nsfer of the property in question, the witness goes on to ste.te!</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b131-3\">\"Early in April, 1918, I wss hunting for some property on the belt, the railroad belt line, for the Simplex Flour Company. X sent out a circular to a number of real estate agents, stating this fact, and amongst other replies received one from the plaintiff\", and without quoting the entire answer to the question put to this witness, he testified that plaintiff first asked him Six Thousand Dollars for the property and insisted that his client would not take less than that sum, that his commission on that would be three per cent, or five per cent, finally offering to pay for the property, provided <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"120\">*120</page-number>the description and <em>the </em>titles were olear, <em>the </em>sum of Fifty Five Hundred Dollars, and finding that the sketch was not quite oorreot, another 3ketoh ws.3 given to him and the titles hfeving been examined a part of the property was found not to be oorrect and the prioe therefore was reduced to the sum of \u00a75100.00, whioh was finally accepted and during the oourse of a. conversation he agreed to reoeive one hundred dollars less from the defendant for the oommission he we 3 to have received.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-2\">Q, Did he say what his oommission was?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b132-3\">A.
