Wherefore he prays that plaintiff's suit be dismissed at his cost.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">are met with At the outset of this suit we/ the fact that compensation is plead when the'demand has not been liquidated.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>Civil Code Art. 3309 reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-2\">\"Compensation \u00edak=3 piaos only between two debta, hav'ing equally for their object a sum of money, or a certain quantity of consumable things of one and the same kind, and which are equally liquidated and demendable.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-3\">The Code of Practice, Art. 366 reads:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-4\">\"Compensation, or setoff, is a mode of extinguishing debts, which takes place when it happens that both plaintiff and defendant ere indebted to each other; each retaining, in payment of the sum due to him, the amount which he owes to the other.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">There are numerous deolsione by both this Court and the Supreme Court, whioh maintain both the Civil Code and the Code of Preotice, and in the ca9e of Hope vs. Howard, 19 Ann. p. 465; where the Court held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-6\">\"Plaintiff filed a bill of exception to the admission of the evidence, and the objections in the bill are, that his olaim was a liquidated one, having been liquidated by the acknowledgment of the defendant, in his answer, and that an unli-quidated olaim, as was defendant's for the sale of the wcod to plaintiff, oould not be pleeded in compensation against it, nor could defendant1s claim be pleaded in reoonventlon, because it was not connected with his, plaintiff's olaim for rent, and because both parties were residents of the same parish.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">Gardner vs. Hattier, 9th Court of Appeal, 18:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-8\">\"It is of the essence of the plea in compensation that it admits the debt' sued on.\" <em>jJ</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">In Maillet vs. Martin, 7th Ann. 635:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-10\">\"Proof of compensation oannot be reoeived where the defendant's plea of compensation is vague and indefinite. Such a p'lqa should state the nature and amounts of the claims, with suoh precision as to prevent the plaintiff's being surprised.\"</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-12\">We therefore hold that under the pleadings presented exceptions 6 by the defendant in this case, proper/a\u00bb$i\u00bfe\u00ed\u00e1x\u00aee having been <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>made to tie receiving of evidence attempted to show damages to the extent of amount of plaintiff's claim and denying his obligation, cannot be maintained under the laws of this State and therefore the objection to taking t93timony should have been maintained and plaintiff having proven the entire amount of balanoe due and sued for, is entitled to judgment therefor, together with interest as prayed for by him.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-2\">For the reasons assigned, it is ordered,- adjudged and deoreed that the judgment o-f the Court aqua be and the seme is affirmed,, with costs of both Courts to be taxed against defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-3\">-Judgment affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
