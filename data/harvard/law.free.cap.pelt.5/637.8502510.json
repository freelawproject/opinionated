The disoussion was to reduce the profits for the income.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b659-4\">Q, The discussion you sey wes to reduce the profits for the inoome tax? A. Yes, but now who brought the subject up, I can't sey positively, but Mr. Hook spoke about it and I spoke about it and Mr. Ouasims.no spoke about it and it seems as though that entry wc.s a result of th\u00bbt discussion. After stating the facts at the time, I have comp-le-ely forgot all about it. In other words, I didn't went to be putting en-gr\u00edes on the books th't would be fictitious, ?nd I so stated.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b659-5\">The testimony of the defendant, together with thst of the plaintiff would throw no further light upon this intricate subjeot.
