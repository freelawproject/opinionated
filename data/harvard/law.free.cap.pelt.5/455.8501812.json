Swiller and I went off and. got into his oar, which was a matter of thirty or forty mi feet in the rear of \u2022 the accidentJ they were both on the ground pioking Up the Spare tire and putting it in their truok.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b474-19\">He testified of his endeavor to have Mr. Diokersoa, to whom he had told his troubles, to replace the articles that had been stolen and he refused, stating that he would prefer to believe his meohanics than to believe me. He stated the impossibility of his taking the cushions and other SttisgsXffiS equipment in his friend's car, which was a small <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>Ford; henos did not take anything except what he had testified to ,</p>\n<p id=\"b475-2\">The main witness for the defendant was Mr. Sonden-berg, who testified substantially that he was an automobile mechanic, had been so engaged for about five years, that on the night in question he was employed by the defendant oompany and that temas he went to the corner of Laurel and DufSJssat Streets to loo}: after plaintiff's troubles with hie oar where he had been ordered to go by the night clerk and described the trouble with the oar. A helper by the name of Harkness was with hj.m, and we went end found, -tjhe oar at on the River side of the street; tbe axel was Srafcsnt knocked baok and the steering rod was bent.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ATY\">,Q.

I told Mr. Kendall that te we would have to in tow the oar and we did hot have any dolly and for him to take everything out of the oar which oould be stolen, to take th\u00f3 extra tire off and he eaid no, he would attend to everything.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AjT0\">Q, Is is or is it not true that Mr. Kendall got into the Ford automobile and drove away while you and Harkness were still on the ground!,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Agb\">sir, \u2022 A. Ho/stray Mr. Kendall was there when we left.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">The reason this witness gave for not returning with the dolly or axtte otherwise, to take baok plaintiff's oar, was that he did not specify when he would oome baok, simply told him he would oome baok,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b475-7\">Q.

Kendall, the question was asked:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-3\">Q. Wh-'t did Hr. Kendall say to you when you arrived at the scene of the acoident?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-4\">A. He asked me if we come to take charge of the car and X told him yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-5\">Q. What did you then tell him?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-6\">A.

Did Harkness?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-10\">A. Ho sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-11\">Q. Who drove away from the place firsts</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ARK\">A, We did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-12\">Q. Did you let Hr. Kendall go away?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-13\">A. Ho sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-14\">Q. Did you tell Hr. Kendall you vvould be back in about twenty minutes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-15\">A. Ho sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-16\">Q. What time did you go back actually to get that oar?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-17\">A. About seven o'clock the next morning.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-18\">Q. Did you expect Mr, Kendall to stay there all night until you came back?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-19\">A. Ho sir.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Ae3\">8Jy the Court:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-21\">Q. Why did you tell Mr. Kendall you would promptly return?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b476-22\">A, We did not specify what time we would return back to the oar.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AVk\">litness knew the oar was on the street and made the report of that faot to his office, did not expect Mr. Kendall to stay <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"465\">*465</page-number>there all night long, hut he said he was going to take care of everything or we would hove heon hack right away.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-2\">The testimony of Mr. Dyronte substantially was th-'t he was the night salesmanager for the defendant company and it was hie duty to attend to the truck cars, sending them out on calls; remembers having a call from plaintiff the night of the accident and that plaintiff notified him, gave him his license number, that he was in a wreck, had bent the fander, disabled the c=r and it could not run, hence witness sent the meo; -nice in charge of the tool wagon; he admits that tsstit v/3.3 cetvreen seven and eight o'clock the next morning before the oar was brought into the garage, that the night was rainy and stormy, he had calls on top of calls, and when the mechanics oame back on that night he sent them out to attend to other calls that were waiting for service and at five o'olook on Sunday morning he had sent them to get plaintiff's oar.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-3\">repetition The other parts of witness's testimony i3 a of what had taken place before and the denial of any responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-5\">The witness Mr. W. A. Dickerson, Manager and Principal Stockholder c\u00a3E the defendant company, knows nothing of the ao-oident itself. In a conversation with Hr. Kendall on the following morning, examined the oar and plaintiff showed him that cushions the were gone, the spare tire, head light, and asked witness what defendant company was going to do about it, and I told him that we were not responsible fsrxx because to do the business we were not engaged and perfectly olear of all blame. His information in reference to the entire matter was what he got from Mr. Damonte, otherwise knew nothing at ail about the matter except as to the value of the articles lost.</p>\n<p id=\"b477-11\">The deposition of D. Harkness, substantially states tha.t be was a mechanic's helper at the time stated, in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>employ of the defendant company and that he was ordered hy Mr. Damonts, the night clerk, to accompany Mr, Sonderherg, the othsr witness, on the night of February 28th, 193\u00dc, to go after plaintiff's car; it was a very had night, it was raining, the wind was blowing very hard, the accident to plaintiff's machine was that it sea run into A street car and the machine was badly damaged. He testifies further to remove the valuables, including the cushions, tools and spare tires, as we had been instructed to do in all oases, but the owner of the oar objected to o\u00fcr taking the valuables and stated that he had a' friend living bear by and he would take them to this friend's home, which he did,,or at least he did not allow us to take tab them to ihBgaxstga the garage.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-3\">We hate thus quoted the main portions of the testimony In this ease and the question presented to this Court is whether under the oircumstanoes and all the facts in this case, defendant can or oannot be held \u00a1responsible for the loss of plaintiff's property.</p>\n<p id=\"b478-4\">The testimony as in all similar caseB is conflicting and as frequently decided by the Supreme Court and this Court in such contingencies, when questions of fact are purely involved and the credibility of the witnesses must be inquired into, the Judgment of the low\u00f3r Court will be affirmed, unless manifestly erroneous.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b478-5\">Martinez vs. Fabacher, 118 La. 955; Williams vs. R.

After an examination of this car, they found it so badly injured that it oould not be moved withput the aid of a dolly, henoe, being informed of this fact and being told by these men in the defendant's employ, that they would return and bring the dolly in order to take this automobile back to their shop, plaintiff contends that taking out his tools and some other portions of loose material, he left his csr in the hands of defendant's emplpyses and whilst the men were gathering up end taking into their possession, the tire whioh was on the street, plaintiff and his friend, in the Fprd oar belonging to the latter, returned to his home, believing , as he had a right to do, that the oar was in the possession of the defendant oompany, who would return for it as soon as they opuld oome bank with the dolly. There yrere two men, either one of whom opuld apd should have remained with th&amp;s oar until the dolly was brought; they did not see fit to do so, they possibly believing that plaintiff would remain,whilst he positively asserts and testifies that ha was suffering from a very bad oold, that it was a rainy and \u00b0old night and he having left his automobile with these people, with his friend, went home.</p>\n<p id=\"b479-2\">The Oompany fs next heard of after plaintiff had been notified that his cap; was standing just where he left it, he immediately phoned to the defendant company,- who after this message, sent their men bsok to the seene of the accident <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>arid removed the oar to its garage. In the meantime the property desoribed in plaintiff's petition had been stolen, when, no one knows, no one has testified, the oar remaining in the street all night without gaurd or oare-taker, it doss prove that defendant was negligent in not having sent for the oar and during the time that the oar stood on the street unprotected during the night, while one of the men employed by the defendant could easily have remained until the other returned, and thst being what they were employed for, would make defendant responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-2\">The taking of possession by the defendant of the tire, which is not denied, proves that they intended to return with the dolly to get plaintiff's automobile. Else why take possession of the tire if they did not intend to do the other portion of the work?</p>\n<p id=\"b480-3\">The answer speaks for itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-4\">The property oould and should have been taken oare of by the defendant company; they did not do so; henoe, the loss must fall on them.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-5\">\"The true measure of liability is that the bailee is bound to that degree of diligence which the manner and the nature of his- employment make it reasonable to expect of him and that anything less then this is culpable in him.\"</p>\n<p id=\"b480-6\">6th Ocrpus Juris, 1118, Seo. 57.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-7\">In the supplemental brief filed by the appellant in this ease, we are referred to the esse of Armistead versus the Shreveport and Red River Railroad Oo., 108 La. p. 171, as determinative of the present ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-8\">In that esse there was evidently a deliberate abandonment of the merchandise, henoe the judgment was rendered on tfc:-t partioular point.</p>\n<p id=\"b480-9\">In this the osee at Bar, if under the mixs\u00fcutra&amp;uaxsa evidence, plaintiff abandoned his property deliberately, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>leaving it in the street, possibly the decision in the Armistead case would apply. But we are not inclined to that view. We believe, as stated in this opinion, that the evidenoe satisfied the Judge of the Court aquo that possession had been given by this plaintiff to the defendant and the automobile in question, therefore, was not abandoned. Tho whole question is one of fact and as we have stated the Judge of the lower Court had a better and dearer view of the matter then we have.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-2\">For the resscns assigned, it is ordered, adjudged and deoreed, that the judgment of the Court aquo is hereby affirmed, costs of both Courts to be peid by the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b481-3\">\u2022Judgment affirmed*</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
