We think you should bring this home immediately to the owner because he, of oourse is likewise responsible and by so doing you will proteot yourself.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-10\">We are writing this letter in duplioate, and ask that you kindly sign and return one oopy to bearer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b54-11\">Yours truly?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b54-12\">There are several other letters in oonneotion with this matter but none, of themselves sufficiently important to in any wise bear on the result.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-13\">We have oarefully examined all the testimony in this oase.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-15\">The first witness,one of the plaintiffs, Mr. Edward Marx knows nothing about this oase exoept what his Manager, Mr. Hunt advised him, and sometime subsequent going on the boat to make an examination to asoertain the value.</p>\n<p id=\"b54-16\">Mr. Hunt testifies quite at length, giving hie oonneotion and his duties with plaintiff, identifying the various letters that we have quoted; he swears that he represented plaintiff in the dealings with the defendant in this oase and also testifies to a telephonic conversation that he had with Mr. Koffskey, Superintendent of SsfadnsHt defendant's works and amongst other things says \"an after considering the boat I wanted to know if it was still in taot or if anything had been removed from the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"43\">*43</page-number>\u25a0boat as It was In the original state when we first started to e&amp;. amine it, he said nothing had been removed, it was exaotly as it was some two week# before, then X asked him what he thought of the vessel, he said X think its a very good buy, its a bargain, when asked what the oost of reapirs would be Mr. Koffskey replied that he oould not say as to that, X asked him if he oould still have the vessel for $500.00, the prioe he had stated to me, he said yes, you oan have it for $500.00, I said X will write today and oonflrm it\"; and then goes on to testify about storing the boat and what arrangements he oould make and that Mr. Koffskey answered \"X would have nothing in the world to do with that\"and also that he had made photographs of the vessel, further that he hod offered this boat to Mr. Sohwartz for $3500.00 and that Mr. Sohwartz finally agreed to pay him $1500.00, further testified about the vessel being removed and by whose authority and when he was told the name of the owner, he had' never heard of it and it had never been mentioned prior to this time, he also spoke of the value of the vessel, what it oould be sold for. Doubtless his fsaickixjsiiias familiarity and his axperienoe entitles his testimony in that regard to great weight.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-2\">On Oross examination.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-3\">Q, Ms. Hunt, you reoeived this letter whioh is marked P6 and was written February 34th, 1919, about the date it was written os a day or two later did'nt you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-4\">A. Yes eir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-5\">Q, That was after you had inspeoted the vessel, wasn't it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-6\">A, Yes; after my first visit to the vessel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-7\">Q. And you never aoted on this offer to sell the Huntress for $500.00 until Masoh 18th?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b55-8\">A, Ho, X didn't aooept the offer until then.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b55-9\">Tho other witnesses, without naming them simply give their opinion as to the value of the vessel.</p>\n<p id=\"b55-10\">The witnesses summoned on behalf of defendant were Warren Johnson, X, D, lloHair, G, M. Graoe and George Koffskey.</p>\n<p id=\"b56-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"44\">*44</page-number>The witness Koffskey, after stating Ms position with the defendant as general Superintendent and giving the time he was oonneoted with the oompany, forty six years, says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-2\">Q. Do you remember a conversation you had over the phone with a Mr. Hunt, of A. Marx &amp; Sons, on Maioh 18, 1919, relative to the sale of the yacht Huntress?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-3\">A. Well, Mr. Hunt was on the phone. X don't hear very well on the phone, and I called Mr. Graoe to say what was to he said.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-4\">Q. Then what happened.?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-5\">A. Mr. Graoe spoke about the boat, about the $500,00 and I told Mr. Grace to tell him before we oould sell the boat to him X would notify Mr. Warren Johnson who would get in touoh with Mr. Dietrioh being as Mr. Hunt had spoken about a bill of sale, or something.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-6\">Q. Did that close the conversation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-7\">A. That was the whole conversation.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-8\">Q. Did you tell Mr. Graoe to tell Mr. Hunt he oould have the boat for $500.00?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-9\">A. $500.00 oash, but when he asked for a bill of sale that made a difference, and I told Mr. Graoe at the time to tell him that it would be referred to Mr. Warren Johnson, the manager, and he in turn would get in touoh with Mr. Dietrioh, the party that sent the boat there from the naval station.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-10\">Q. (at page 15) Did you ever make a oontraot to.sell the Huntress to A. Marx &amp; Sons for $500.00?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-11\">A. Hever. I just communicated with three Of the junk men by letter, and received no letter, until some time after, and I think Mr. Hunt came to the shop to see what was on the boat, and I sent him to one of the men on the outside, outside foreman, I doroit know whether Mr. Amrstrong or Mr. Roup, at the time they were working on the wood ships, installing the machinery. After that I heard nothing more, except about Mr. Hunt phoning there, add then I got Mr. Graoe on the telephone.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b56-12\">On Cross examination.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b56-13\">Q. Mr. Koffskey, in that conversation over the telephone did you <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"45\">*45</page-number>not either say yourself, or have Mr. Qraoe eay, that the boat oould he purohased for $500.00 oash?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-2\">A. We offered the boat for $500.00 oash, yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-3\">Q. Tou renewed that offer in the telephone conversation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-4\">A. We offered that by oommunioation, a letter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-5\">Q. Didn't you do it also in this telephone conversation, telling him he oould have it for $500.00 oash?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-6\">A. Hot that I remember.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-7\">Q. (page 16) X show you letter dated Maroh 18, 1919, already introduced in evidence as P-6, and ash you if you received the original of that letter?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-8\">A. I never sold the boat.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b57-9\">\"The sale was not made beoause questions had to be asked outside.\" Mr. Grace, a witness on behalf of the defendant and referred to by Mr. Koffskey as the man he employed, not hearing well, to go to the telephone and receive and answer communications, after stating his position with the defendant of the Company, says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-10\">Q. Do you remember anything about a oonversation over the telephone between Mr. Koffskey, the manager of the Johnson Iron Works and Mr. Hunt, of A. Marx &amp; Sons, on Maroh 18, 1919, relative to the sale of the Yacht Huntress?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-11\">A. Mr. Koffskey, the superintendent. I think it was the 17th or 18th of Maroh that he buzzed to me, calling me from the offioe. When he got a telephone call he generally called me in, for anything like that, beoause he don't hear distinctly. He handed me the phone and said \"Marx is on the phone,\" and he told me to tell them that the $500.00 offer would'nt be accepted until they submitted it to Mr. Warren Johnson, who would submit it to the principal. And there was also something about a bill of sale, that they had to have a bill of sale, they asked for it, and they told him they would have to get that. They didn't know anything about that.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b57-12\">Q. (at page 10) What was done with the offer of $500.00?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"46\">*46</page-number>A, Mr. Koffskey wrote me a note to hand to Mr. Johnson when he oame In. He didn't oome that evening. X put it on hie desk. Next day he diotated a telegram to Mr. Dietrioh, at Hew York, telling him what Marx had' offered for the boat.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-3\">And then this witness testifies that \"In the latter part of Maroh, on the 25th or 36th, Mr. Dietrioh, the owner, walked Into the of-fioe about 6 o'olook when nearly everybody had left but Mr. Wilmer Johnson and X. He saw Mr. Johnson and Mr. Johnson oalled me and told me Mr. Deitrloh was there to take the Huntress, and if it had been sold, and X told him no, and he asked why X said no. X said I had the oorrespondenoe and I had followed the oase up, handling it for Mr. Koffskey.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">Then the witness goes on and relates the taking of Xhii of possession of the Huntress by the owner and telephoning Mr. Hunt the next day to that effeot.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-6\">Q, What did he say?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b58-7\">A. Didn't say anything; hung up the phone.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b58-8\">We have thus quoted from portions of the testimony of the witnesses in this oase, which we considered material to this decision and we find that neither in lawmr in faot was there an absolute sale of the yaoht Huntress to plaintiff by defendant; there were undoubtedly negotiations between these parties but in our opinion they oame to no conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-9\">Art; 1797. CO\u00cdJSMT; COMMOTIO ATIOIT OK. \"When the parties have the legal oapaoity tafig to form a oontraot, the next requisite to its validity is their consent. This being a mxaxa mere operation of the mind, can have no effeot, unless it be evinced in some manner that shall oause it to be understood by the other parties to the oontraot. To prevent error in this essential point, the law establishes, by oertain rules adapted to the nature of the oontraot, what oiroumstanoes shall be wvidenoe of suoh consent, and how those oiroumstanoes shall be proved; these oome within the purview of the law of evidence, \u201c</p>\n<p id=\"b59-1\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"47\">*47</page-number>Ait. 1798.
