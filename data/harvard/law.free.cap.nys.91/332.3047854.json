Dunfee, 172 N. Y. 507, 65 N. E. 494, and Manigold v. Black River T. Co., 81 App. Div. 381, 80 N. Y. Supp. 861. The defendants herein make no claim of nonliability, and offered no testimony whatever in this case tend<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>ing to exonerate themselves from payment for some damages 'for the injuries received by the plaintiff by reason of the alleged negligence of the defendants, but merely sought to show that the injuries sustained by her were not of the character and extent claimed. The questions asked, therefore, could in no way have harmed the defendants.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-3\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">GIEDERSLEEVE, J., concurs.
