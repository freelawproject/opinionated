Kings County El. R. R. Co., 114 N. Y. 467, 491, 21 N. E. 1016. The contract presently in suit may not be said to fall within \u2019the purpose of the creation of the Vienna Ice Cream Company, nor does the evidence disclose corporate benefit, or authority, actual or apparent, in its president or secretary, to obligate it in the particular instance. Cf. Kipp v. East River El. Eight Co. (Com. Pl.) 19 N. Y. Supp. 387. Individually liable they might be, but not the corporation whose officers they may be.- The judgment must therefore be reversed, and a new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event.
