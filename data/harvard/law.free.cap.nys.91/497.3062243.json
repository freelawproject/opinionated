It appears that the property was once conveyed to \u201cWilliam J. Curtis, trustee,\u201d and was conveyed by \u201cWilliam J. Curtis, trustee,\u201d to the defendant in this foreclosure. It further appears that the said conveyance from \u201cWilliam J. Curtis, trustee,\u201d to the said defendant, was made \u201csubject to the restrictions contained in section 14 of title 16 of chapter 583 of the Laws of 1888, as amended by chapter 702 of the Daws of 1897.\u201d It was objected that there was no evidence that the trust under which Curtis took the property was one authorized by the laws of the state of New York, and that the deed from Curtis, trustee, to the said defendant, contains no evidence of the authority of the said Curtis to convey as trustee, nor is there any record thereof or of said trusteeship. It was further objected that the property was conveyed by Curtis to the said defendant under certain restrictions, as I have indicated, while it was sold free and clear, save as to certain assessments, as to which no objection is made.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">I think that the motion was rightly denied. The facts that beyond the word \u201ctrustee\u201d there was no evidence to establish any trusteeship, that the term was simply \u201ctrustee\u201d and not \u201cas trustee,\u201d and that the conveyance to Curtis, trustee, ran to his heirs and assigns forever, bring the case within Greenwood Lake &amp; P. J. R. R. Co. v. N. Y. &amp; G. L. R. R. Co., 134 N. Y. 435, 31 N. E. 874. \u201cTrustee\u201d is but descriptio personae; the conveyance to Curtis, trustee, was absolute, and his power of conveyance was unlimited. See, too, King v. Townshend, 141 N. Y. 358, 36 N. E. 513; Kanenbley v. Volkenberg, 70 App. Div. 97, 75 N. Y. Supp. 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-8\">As to the alleged restrictions, the purchaser rests upon the clause in the deed, and offers no evidence whatever. The assistant solicitor for the plaintiff deposes that the laws referred to imposed no restrictions upon lots upon the street whereon this lot is situate, or upon this lot, and that there are no restrictions anywhere provided for. It is quite apparent that there is a mistake in the citation of the statute. A reading of the statute itself seems to make it plain that this lot is not within the purview thereof. If a defect is patent in the record of title, the purchaser may rest thereon; otherwise, he must give evidence in justification of his refusal. Goodwin v. Crooks, 58 App. Div. 464, 69 N. Y. Supp. 578; Greenblatt v. Hermann, 144 N. Y. 13, 18, 38 N. E. 966; Simon v. Vanderveer, 155 N. Y. 377, 49 N. E. 1043, 63 Am. St. Rep. 683. I think it clear that mere reference to the statute as if restrictive, when it is not, cannot effectuate a covenant, thereby giving to the statute a' scope beyond the legislative intent. See Clark v. N. Y. Life Ins. and Trust Co., 64 N. Y. 33, Platt v. Finck, 60 App. Div. 312, 70 N. Y. Supp. 74. It is suggested that the clause was inserted because the lot at the time was part of a tract through which the streets restricted by the statute ran, and either that the remoteness of that part from those <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>streets was not considered, or the parties failed to note the streets not restricted, or the clause was left as harmless surplusage.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">The order should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
