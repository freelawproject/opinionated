We consider that the justice construed the in<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"749\">*749</page-number>dorsement too narrowly. The true construction, as we regard it, is that the order for goods should be treated as payment pro tanto of the bill for advertising. As to the balance of the advertising bill, the defendant cannot, under his contract, recover.</p>\n<p id=\"b783-5\">Judgment reversed and new trial granted, with costs to the appellant to abide the event</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
