It is apparent from the evidence\u2014mainly the opinions of experts\u2014that, while scientifically related, \"shaddocks\u201d were not grape fruit for commercial purposes, and there is, therefore, no reasonable basis upon the proof for a conclusion that the goods ordered were delivered, with a difference of quality merely. The scientific relation of these classes of fruit does not affect the fact that for the actual purposes of the transaction between the parties they were distinct in kind; and while the plaintiff, upon the trial, withdrew the admission that shaddocks were not grape fruit, and sought to prove the contrary, to meet the ground upon which a prior judgment was reversed by this court (Abel v. Murphy, 43 Misc. Rep. 648, 88 N. Y. Supp. 256), the evidence failed to establish that there was any substantial identity.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-17\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
