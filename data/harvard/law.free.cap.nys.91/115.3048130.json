Thus we cannot assume that the conclusion was reached upon some other ground, assailed by the appellant as erroneous. It would appear, however, that the absence of written authority was fatal to the case. Whiteley v. Terry, 83 App. Div. 197, 82 N. Y. Supp. 89.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-16\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.
