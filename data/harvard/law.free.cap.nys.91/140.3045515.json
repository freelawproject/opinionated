The Municipal Court has not jurisdiction of an action upon a judgment of the Supreme Court, for the reason that its jurisdiction is extended only to an action upon a judgment rendered in any court not being a court of record. Section 1, subd. 6, Municipal Court Act (Laws 1902, p. 14-88, c. 580). I think that the action authorized by section 1391 of the Code of Civil Procedure should be regarded as an action upon a judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-8\">The amendment to section 1391 is contained in article 1, tit. 2, c. 8, relating to execution, and it is evident that the Legislature thought that the remedy was logically placed under the head of proceedings in furtherance of judgments. The remedy is available only to a judgment creditor, and it is based upon a failure or refusal of the debtor of the judgment debtor to satisfy the execution to the extent of his obligation to the judgment debtor. The penalty of such failure or refusal is an action against him by the judgment creditor. If the presentation of the execution is sufficient to require the payment, it would seem that the action which then is authorized upon failure or refusal to pay is in furtherance of the collection, and logically is based upon the judgment and the execution, which is but its creature. It seems illogical that the action, which is to enforce a demand based on the execution, should not also be based upon the execution, and consequently upon the judgment. If the judgment creditor cannot proceed upon the judgment, then he, like any ordinary claimant, is bound to establish the liability de novo. It would follow that, despite the judgment directly obtained against the debtor, the creditor must again establish that cause of action against a third party before he can reach money which belongs to the judgment debtor. The remedy is plainly intended to be in furtherance of the collection of judgments in cases when a peculiar hardship exists and money available to satisfy a judgment is in the hands of a third party. Thus it is based upon the judgment and the execution. Any other construction would defeat the purpose, and there is no sound reason for it. And, further, such an action is not to foreclose a lieu upon a chattel under section 1, subd. 10, of the Municipal Court Act (Laws 1902, p. 1488, c. 580). Even if the term \u201cchattel,\u201d as used in the context, were generic enough to include the money in question\u2014which is open to debate\u2014there is no lien. \u201cA lien is the right of one to retain property in his possession belonging to another, until certain demands of him in possession are satisfied.\u201d Jordan v. National Shoe &amp; Leather Bank, 74 N. Y. 467, 473, 30 Am. Rep. 319. A right to prior payment is not in itself .a lien. Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, vol. 19, p. 6, citing authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b175-10\">Interlocutory judgment of the Municipal Court affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
