But examination of the exceptions filed by her shows that they are limited to the first conclusion of law, which determines that the trust created for the benefit of the deceased\u2019s two children in the sixth paragraph of the will is invalid. We shall consider that the general terms of the appeal are limited by the exceptions; otherwise the proponent of -the will would be the opponent, which is anomalous, if not absurd. The testator, after disposing of certain trinkets, provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-13\">\u201cAll the rest residue and remainder of my estate, real and personal, I give, devise and bequeath to my said sister Catharine Cuffe, in trust for the maintenance and education of my said children, and hereby appoint her trustee of said fund to have and to hold the same as long as said trust may continue.\u201d'</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b194-14\">There is no other disposition made or attempted to be made of her estate. It appears that the testator did not leave any realty. If she had, this mere passive trust of the realty would be avoided, and the beneficiaries would take the legal estate. Rawson v. Lampman, 5 N. Y. 456; Fisher v. Hall, 41 N. Y. 416; Ramsay v. De Remer, 65 Hun, 212, 20 N. Y. Supp. 143; Hopkins v. Kent, 145 N. Y. 363, 40 N. E. 4; section 73, Real Property Law (Laws 1896, p. 570, c. 547). The rule takes the estate from the mere passive holder of the legal title, and executes the practical intent by vesting it in the beneficiary. See Townshend v. Frommer, 125 N. Y. 446, 458, 26 N. E. 805; Reeves on Real Property, \u00a7 330. As the reason for the rule applies to personal estate, therefore the rule should apply to it as well. In Cochrane v. Schell, 140 N. Y. 516, 534, 35 N. E. 971, 976, Andrews, C. J., says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b194-15\">\u201cThere is a manifest propriety in assimilating as far as practicable the rules governing trusts and limitations of real and personal property, and the tendency in this direction has been very marked in the decisions of the courts. Graff v. Bonnett, 31 N. Y. 9, 88 Am. Dec. 236; Cutting v. Cutting, 86 N. Y. 523; Williams v. Thorn, 70 N. Y. 270; Hutton v. Benkard, 92 N. Y. 295; Cook v. Lowry, 95 N. Y. 103.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b195-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"161\">*161</page-number>See, too, Mills v. Husson, 140 N. Y. 99,104, 35 N. E. 422.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-4\">I think that the estate is freed from any trust, and that it is vested in fee in the two children; for the expression \u201csaid children\u201d in the said sixth clause demonstrates that the children are Florence and Joseph, who are the sole children xtheretofore named therein. Their title is that of tenants in common. Section 56, Real Property Law (Laws 1896, p. 569, c. 547) ; Mills v. Husson, 140 N. Y. 104, 35 N. E. 424. The only other question raised before the surrogate is purely one of law, but no exception was taken to his determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b195-5\">The decree of the surrogate should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
