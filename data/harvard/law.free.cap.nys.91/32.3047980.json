Thereafter the defendants served an amended answer alleging that they \u201creiterate and reallege each and every allegation set forth and contained\u201d in certain paragraphs of the original answer, with amendment of the affirmative defenses. A motion for judgment upon this amended answer, as frivolous, was denied; but, upon the case being called for trial, the plaintiff obtained judgment on the pleadings, and the defendants took an appeal from the judgment. Upon the settlement of the case on appeal, the court struck out the order which denied the plaintiff\u2019s earlier motion for judgment on the amended answer, as frivolous, and also struck out the original an<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"33\">*33</page-number>swer; both papers having been included in the proposed case on appeal, as a part of the judgment roll. x</p>\n<p id=\"b67-5\">In our opinion, the' court committed no error in striking out these papers, and the order appealed from should not be disturbed. When the defendants served their amended answer, so described, the earlier answer was superseded for all purposes of the record \"(Dexter v. Dustin, 24 N. Y. Supp. 129, 70 Hun, 515; Thornton v. R. Co., 6 Daly, 511); and the defendants could not change its status by the mistaken practice of referring to it in the amended pleading, at least without the plaintiff\u2019s consent. Here the plaintiff did nothing in the slightest degree inconsistent with the position that the amended answer was to be treated as such, and the court therefore was not required to take the pleadings as consolidated, by consent, without an order, as in Kline v. Corey, 18 Hun, 524\u2014a case where the amended complaint was futile unless treated as a supplemental complaint, and where the defendant answered to the merits, with recognition of the original complaint, after the amendment. We must hold, therefore, that the original answer had no place in the judgment roll; and so, too, of the order denying the plaintiff\u2019s motion for judgment upon the amended answer as frivolous. The order was, of course, no adjudication that the amended answer was sufficient as matter of law. The motion presented no more than the proposition that the pleading was insufficient upon a bare, inspection, without the need of argument, and the order denying that motion necessarily left the question of the legal sufficiency of the pleading wholly unaffected. An interlocutory order, to become a part of the judgment roll, must be one which in some way \u201cinvolves the merits or necessarily .affects the judgment\u201d (Code Civ. Proc. \u00a7 1237)\u2014qualities which the order in question cannot, in any sense, be said to possess.</p>\n<p id=\"b67-6\">We conclude that the order appealed from should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements! All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
