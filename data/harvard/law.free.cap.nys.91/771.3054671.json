Since the case on appeal contains no statement that it contains all the evidence given upon the trial, we cannot review the facts (Gorham Mfg. Co. v. Seale, 3 App. Div. 515, 38 N. Y. Supp. 307), and must confine ourselves to the exceptions taken by the appellant. Only one of these requires consideration. It was the defendant\u2019s contention that the loan now sued for had been made pursuant to a resolution of the directors of the defendant adopted at a meeting at which one of the plaintiffs, being a director, was present. That resolution provided that the stockholders of the company should advance the sum of $2,000 to their proportionate amount of shareholdings in the company, to be irivested as a loan, and become due eight jrears from the 1st day of May, 1903. This resolution was introduced in evidence, although there was some attempt on plaintiffs\u2019 part to question the fact of its adoption, and an entire disclaimer of any knowledge of it. At the close of the charge the defendant asked the court to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"772\">*772</page-number>charge that, \"if the jury shall find that the money was advanced pursuant to the resolution adopted, then the verdict should be for the defendant.\u201d This was refused, and herein we think that the court fell into error. The resolution distinctly provided for a credit of eight years, and, if the loan was made pursuant to that resolution, it would necessarily follow that the plaintiff had made a loan payable in eight years, and could not now recover. We have examined with care the colloquial charge, and have been unable to find therein any instruction which can fairly be said to cover the defendant\u2019s request.</p>\n<p id=\"b806-5\">Judgment reversed, and new trial granted, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
