The complaint is ^ \u201caction on chattel mortgage.\u201d The answ\u00e9r is a \u201cgeneral denial.\u201d The uncontradicted evidence shows that the two defendants were co-partners, and that the plaintiff loaned to the defendant Wilk $200, and took a chattel mortgage on the partnership property executed in the firm name by Wilk alone. This action is to foreclose that mortgage. The defendant Miller alone defended the action. The justice found for the defendant. The plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-20\">Four witnesses were called for the plaintiff, and only one for the defendant, i. e., Miller himself. The plaintiff swears that he has known Miller for about 5 years, and Wilk for about 12 years; that one day in the middle of November, 1903, he and one Balofslcy were playing cards with the two defendants, at defendants\u2019 place of business, when Wilk said he wished plaintiff would loan defendants $200, which request was repeated by Miller; plaintiff gave no positive answer; that a few days later Wilk said to plaintiff, \u201cCohen, will you lend me $200 ?\u201d to which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>request plaintiff replied he would consider the matter; that still again Wilk asked plaintiff, \u201cDid you make up your mind to give us the money?\u201d that plaintiff asked, \u201cWhere is Miller?\u201d and Wilk replied, \u201cMiller sent me over to see you;\u201d that plaintiff then said he would send a man to see if the property was sufficient security; that he did send one Meyer, who reported favorably, and that he gave the $200 to Wilk, who gave him the chattel mortgage in suit. One Balofsky is then called for plaintiff, and swears that he knew both defendants, and corroborated plaintiff as to the game of cards and the request of Wilk, in the presence of Miller, for the loan during the said game of cards, or shortly thereafter, at defendants\u2019 place of business in November, 1903. He contradicts himself somewhat as to the details of that interview. The next witness is one Meyer, who swears that he examined the property of defendants, at the request of plaintiff, and had a talk with Wilk, but states that he did not speak to Miller. The plaintiff and these two witnesses appear to have known Wilk a long time. The next witness is Wilk himself, who corroborates the testimony of plaintiff as to the game of cards, and states, that he made the request for a loan of $200 after the game was finished, and that Miller said, \u201cIt would be a good thing;\u201d that, after the loan had been made and the mortgage given, he gave $100 of the sum so loaned to Miller, and kept the other $100 himself. The plaintiff then rested his case, and Miller was called as a witness on his own behalf. He denied that he received the $100 from Wilk, or that he authorized the mortgage, or that he had any knowledge of the loan or mortgage until the marshal came to defendants\u2019 place of business with a warrant of attachment in this action. He also denied that the partnership needed this loan.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">The justice appears to have given credit to the testimony of Miller, and rendered judgment in his favor, as we have seen. We think this conclusion is against the evidence,and against the weight of evidence, and that for this reason the judgment should be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">But even assuming the denials of Miller to be well founded, we find the facts to be, as shown by uncontradicted testimony, as follows, viz.: Wilk borrowed $200 from plaintiff, and gave a mortgage on the partnership property \u2022 therefor, keeping the whole sum of $200 for himself, while Miller knew nothing of said loan and mortgage until after the commencement of this .action; but plaintiff understood the loan was made to the firm. Whether or not there was any specific limitation in the articles of copartnership upon the powers and authority of Wilk, we do not know, as the said articles were not allowed in evidence. We shall assume, therefore, that there was none, so far as the purposes of this appeal are concerned. All the members of a Arm are liable, where money is borrowed by one of the partners on the credit of the firm, whether applied to the business of the firm or misapplied. Onondaga County Bark v. De Puy, 17 Wend. 47; Whitaker v. Brown, 16 Wend. 505. One partner can, without consulting his copartner, execute, in the firm name, a chattel mortgage of the firm\u2019s property to secure a firm debt. Neer v. Oakley, 2 N. Y. Supp. 482; Willett v. Stringer, 17 Abb. Prac. 152. The general rule is that one .partner may bind the partnership to any transaction, within the apparent scope of the copartnership business, without the knowledge or consent of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>other partner, so that a third party, acting in good faith, may recover against the copartners.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">It is apparently the theory of the defense that plaintiff and Wilk had entered into a scheme to defraud Miller. But where is there any proof of bad faith on the part of plaintiff? The uncontradicted evidence, as we have seen, is that one partner borrowed money, ostensibly for the firm, and gave this mortgage executed by one partner in the name of both. This transaction was not without the apparent scope of the partnership business, so as to call upon plaintiff to require the signature of both partners,'especially as Wilk, whom he had known a long time, told-him that \u201cMiller had sent him over to see\u201d plaintiff about the loan. Plaintiff, as we have pointed out, supposed he was loaning to the firm, and had no reason to suspect that Wilk was without authority to borrow the money or give the mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">It is doubtful if the issue of fraud could be properly raised here, b)r reason of the answer. Fraud is a defense that should be pleaded, and the answer herein, as we have seen, is a general denial. We think that, under the proofs presented, it must be held that plaintiff\u2019s mortgage has been shown to be a valid mortgage.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">The judgment is reversed and a new trial granted, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
