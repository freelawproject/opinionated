Fishel, 169 N. Y. 381, 62 N. E. 425, is cited to the proposition. In Michaels v. Fishel the landlord\u2019s right to relet for the tenant\u2019s account depended upon his re-entry for the tenant\u2019s default, and the court, giving the strict common-law meaning to the term, interpreted the lease as excluding such a reletting where possession was not assumed by the landlord through resort to the remedy of ejectment to enforce the right of \u201creentry,\u201d as technically understood; hence the covenant was held unavailable where possession was resumed by invoking the summary remedy given by the statute. The covenant in the lease before us gives the landlord the right to \u201cresume possession\u201d\u2014a term of no technical meaning, and obviously not inconsistent with the maintenance of summary proceedings to enforce the right. The word \u201cre-enter\u201d is not used in the covenant, and, beyond the possibility of argument, the rule of Michaels v. Fishel does not apply. Such a covenant is enforceable, notwithstanding the termination of the lease, by summary proceedings (Lewis v. Stafford, 21 Misc. Rep. 717, 53 N. Y. Supp. 801), and there was therefore error in the dismissal of this counterclaim.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-12\">The court below also erred in the construction of the pleadings leading to the ruling that the plaintiff\u2019s case was established without proof. The answer contained certain specific admissions, and then proceeded t\u00f3 deny each and every other allegation of the complaint \u201cnot hereinbefore specifically admitted, controverted, or denied.\u201d This sufficed as a general denial. Griffin v. L. I. R. Co., 101 N. Y. 348, 4 N. E. 740; There was no ambiguity in what was covered by the denial, depending upon the discovery of -allegations \u201cnot qualified,\u201d as in Clark v. Dillon, 97 N. Y. 370, and the latter case is to be distinguished from the case at bar precisely as it was distinguished in the Griffin Case.</p>\n<p id=\"b41-13\">Judgment reversed and new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
