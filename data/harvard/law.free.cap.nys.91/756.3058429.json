The plaintiff was the only witness in his own behalf, and he testified that he never was in Poughkeepsie, but intrusted the work of setting up the tank to two of his employ\u00e9s. The absence of these men as witnesses was not accounted for. The testimony of the defendant and two witnesses, one wholly disinterested as to the condition of the tank, was therefore undisputed, and showed that the tank when set up was not tight, and that ever since it was erected it has leaked badly, and that it will cost at least $50 to make it conform to the agreement. Upon complaint made by the defendant, the plaintiff, some two months after the tank was erected, sent two men to repair it; but it was shown that their efforts failed, and it was further shown that as late as October 5, 1903, the tank having been erected July 9, 1903, the plaintiff promised to go to Poughkeepsie himself, and endeavor to make it conform to the agreement. This appointment, however, he did not keep. The judgment is clearly against the weight of evidence, and must be reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b791-5\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
