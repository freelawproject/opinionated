In the agreement, however, the plaintiff undertook on his part, as soon as practicable, to obtain and .surrender .to the defendant a certificate for 235 shares of a specified stock, but of this interdependent covenant the plaintiff neither alleged performance nor tender, nor excuse. For this failure of the plaintiff to set up fulfillment on his own part of their mutual agreement, the defendant demurred, and rightly, for the complaint is therein defective, and the interlocutory judgment should be reversed, with costs, and the demurrer sustained, because one may not recover upon an entire agreement without alleging and proving performance, or excusing nonperformance, of his own covenant.</p>\n<p id=\"b358-5\">Interlocutory judgment reversed, with costs, and demurrer sustained, with costs, with leave to plaintiff to amend complaint upon payment of such costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
