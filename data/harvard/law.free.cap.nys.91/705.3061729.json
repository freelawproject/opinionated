Thereupon a motion was made not to transfer the cause to a district adjoining the first, but to transfer the cause to the district in which defendant lived. This motion was denied, and no appeal was taken nor was any protest lodged at the trial. <em>Held, </em>that defendant had waived the objection that the district to which the cause was transferred did not adjoin the district in which it was brought.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b739-11\">Appeal from Municipal Court, Borough of Manhattan, Seventh District.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b739-12\">Action by Isaac Lesser against Solomon Adolph.

The pleadings were oral. The particulars furnished declare that on or about April 17, 1904, the defendant represented that he was the owner of certain property, and that \u201cit was 25' 6\u201c in width and 100' in length\u201d; that the statement was false, to the knowledge of the defendant, and made for the purpose of inducing the plaintiff to purchase the property; and that the plaintiff, in reliance thereon, paid to the defendant the sum of $332.33, \u201cas a deposit for the entering into a contract.\u201d At the trial it was conceded that the dimensions of the property in question \u201care 25 feet in width by 94.85 in depth, and 25.26 by 91.24 on the other side\u2014 an irregular lot.\u201d In view of this concession of dimensions and of sufficient evidence, though conflicting, of the making of the statement in relation thereto, the judgment entered upon the verdict <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>in favor of the plaintiff should not,\\because of some error in either the admission or exclusion of evidence, particularly in relation to ownership, be disturbed, more especially, however, in view of plaintiff\u2019s Exhibit A, which was treated as a contract between the parties, instead of a receipt containing no agreement, and so not enforceable under the statute (Filkins v. Whyland, 24 N. Y. 338, and Coe v. Tough, 116 N. Y. 273, 22 N. E. 550); and, further, if contract instead of receipt, it lacked subscription by the plaintiff, within the meaning of the statute and of the decision of James v. Patten, 6 N. Y. 9, 55 Am. Dec. 376, and so may not be enforced. Wherefore the plaintiff is entitled to the sum deposited by him with the defendant, and the justice or the case demands that the judgment should be affirmed, for the merits of the cause are with the plaintiff. Municipal Court Act (Daws 1902, p. 1583, c. 580) \u00a7 326.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-5\">It is contended, however, not that the district in which this action was brought, but that the district to which it was transferred, was not the proper district, and that therefore the justice who tried the cause was without jurisdiction. It appears that the transfer was. made because of disqualification, and under section 13 of the Municipal Court act it was mandatory upon the justice disqualified to transfer the cause to an adjoining district. True, this was not done, but no objection therefor was raised until this appeal. The only objection appearing, if objection it may be called, was the motion, before trial in the court to which the cause had been transferred, for further transfer, not to the district adjoining the district in which the cause had been brought, but to the district in which the defendant lived. This was denied, but from the order entered no appeal appears to have been taken or protest lodged at the trial, as was the case in Heller v. Herbst, 26 Misc. Rep. 780, 57 N. Y. Supp. 270. The defendant must be deemed to have waived what he now objects, for it does not appear that the district in which the action was brought was not the proper district, and the application for transfer under sudivision 4 of section 25 of the Municipal Court act was therefore without right; and the original district being proper, so was the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b740-6\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
