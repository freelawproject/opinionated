The papers on an appeal of this kind consist of printed copies of the papers which were used in the court below, and as specified in the order certified by the clerk, or stipulated by the parties to be true copies of the original, and of the whole thereof. . General Rules of Practice 41. The order appealed from does not specify the papers used in the court below. Said rule requires that the papers used in the court below shall be so specified in the order. Where they are so specified in the order, such papers, with the order appealed from and th\u00e9 notice of appeal, must be printed, filed, and served as provided by said rule. If the papers used in the court below are specified in the order, it results in a determination by the court making the order appealed from as to what papers shall be printed if an appeal is taken from the order, and the certificate of the clerk is then simply for the purpose of establishing the fact that the papers so printed are true copies of the originals required by the rule to be printed.</p>\n<p id=\"b697-10\">It will be necessary for the appellant to have the order appealed from amended so as to specif}^ the papers which were used in the court below, and print and serve the papers so specified with the order and notice of appeal, or the appeal will, on proper motion, be dismissed.
