Plaintiff was retained by one Delabarre to foreclose a certain mortgage upon premises in Westchester county. The action was brought, resulting in a judgment of foreclosure. The premises were sold under the judgment to one Charles E. Teets, and Delabarre was given a deficiency judgment amounting to $10,-000 against the defendant in the foreclosure proceedings, and thus all \u00f3f the purposes of the action had been accomplished, so far as the plaintiff in that action was concerned. He had secured $5,000 in money and a deficiency judgment, and his interest in and his power over the subject-matter of that litigation was at an end, so that the relation of attorney and client, in so far as the foreclosure proceeding was concerned, was dissolved. Foster v. Bookwalter, 152 N. Y. 166, 169, 46 N. E. 299, and authorities there cited. It appears, however, that the purchase of the premises by Mr. Teets was made in behalf of Delabarre, who subsequently organized a corporation, to whom the title to the premises was transferred, and when the corporation sought to gain possession of the premises it was met by persons claiming to have been tenants of the owner before the bringing of the action of foreclosure, and who refused to vacate the premises. Confronted by this situation, Delabarre, as secretary and treasurer of the defendant corporation, employed the plaintiff, and the services for which judgment has been found were rendered in an effort to gain possession of the premises for the corporation. We see no reason why, in law, the plaintiff is not entitled to his pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-9\">The judgment appealed from should be affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
