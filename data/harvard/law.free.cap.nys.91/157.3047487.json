The defendant acquiesced in the instruction, in no way suggesting that the amount stated was open to question, and made no motion to dismiss, or for submission of the case on any different theory. <em>Meld, </em>that defendant could not urge on appeal a different construction of the agreement.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"5\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b191-16\">2. \u25a0\u2018Witness\u2014Refreshing Recollection\u2014Use of Memorandum.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b191-17\">A witness may refresh his recollection of figures by resorting to a memorandum where his testimony is given on his recollection as refreshed, and not on the memorandum itself.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b191-18\">If 2.

The defendant acquiesced in this instruction, in no way suggested that the amount stated was open to question, and made no motion for dismissal of the complaint, or for the submission of the case to the jury upon any different theory. Any contention that the judgment is based upon a misconception of the correct method of adjusting the account is thus rendered futile at this time, and the appellant is in no position to urge a different construction of the agreement, not suggested by motion or request at the trial, for the purposes of an appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-9\">No error was committed in permitting a witness to refresh his recollection of figures by resort to a memorandum; his testimony having been given upon his recollection as refreshed, and not upon the memorandum itself. <em>i</em></p>\n<p id=\"b192-10\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.
