There is nothing improbable in this agreement, since the profit upon a gross business of $100 a day was not necessarily excessive of what should ordinarily be derived from an investment of $2,100 in the business of personally conducting a store. The credibility of the witnesses was for the justice to determine, and there is nothing to infirm his conclusion upon this record.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-15\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
