So soon as . the j\u2019ury was. impaneled, counsel for Nicolo and Cutter moved to strike from Cutter\u2019s answer the words \u201cand for a counterclaim,\u201d and in lieu of \u201cfor the sum of ten thousand dollars\u201d in the prayer to insert \u201cfor offset and credit as aforesaid, and for such other and further relief as the court may deem just.\u201d This was granted, over the objection, with exception, that the pleading, whether called a counterclaim or defense, was improper. Counsel for the petitioner then moved to dismiss the pleading, whatever termed, because not a proper defense in a proceeding to dispossess for nonpayment of rent.</p>\n<p id=\"b826-4\">Calling it so did not make the allegation a set-off, which may only arise when the demands of both parties are liquidated, or capable of being ascertained by calculation. Batterman v. Pierce, 3 Hill, 174. It remained a counterclaim, which is a separate and distinct cause of action, balancing in whole or in part that proved by the plaintiff (Walker v. American Cent. Ins. Co., 143 N. Y. 169, 38 N. E. 106), and was thus recognized by the learned justice, who remarked, \u201cThe counterclaim is allowed to stand as amended by the tenant.\u201d Inasmuch as only defenses showing that the petitioner\u2019s claim has not legal existence may be interposed in such a proceeding (Gay v. Riehmann M. Co., 53 App. Div. 507, 65 N. Y. Supp. 964; Wulff v. Cilento, 28 Misc. Rep. 551, 59 N. Y. Supp. 525), the denial of the motion was reversible error, an error later aggravated. When the petitionerrested, the proceedings as against Cutter were dismissed on motion of his counsel and on consent of counsel for the petitioner. As the first and chief witness there came Cutter, who was allowed to testify respecting most of the things set up in his \u201cfurther and distinct defense,\u201d particularly as to the issuance to him of the liquor tax certificate, and to its subsequent seizure. The evidence thus erroneously admitted tended to distract the jury from the one issue whether Nicolo was a tenant in possession, to prejudice by an appearance of harsh action toward Cutter, and to justify a contention, made below and on this appeal, that the issuance, under the circumstances testified to, of a license to Cutter, estopped the petitioner from asserting the tenancy to be in anybody but Cutter\u2014a contention which the certificate was not evidence to support (Furey v. O\u2019Connor [Sup.] 85 N. Y. Supp. 324), but which the learned justice adopted in a part of his charge made on request of the tenant\u2019s counsel and excepted to by counsel for the petitioner. These errors suffice for reversal, without considering the paucity of evidence given for the tenant, if any were left after Nicolo and Cutter were confronted by their contradictory declarations-, or animadverting upon the incongruity of the defense which began by a proffer- to the petitioner on Cut<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"793\">*793</page-number>ter\u2019s behalf and deposit in court of $833.33, payment of the rental in default, though Cutter in his verified pleading averred that he had paid the rent promptly.</p>\n<p id=\"b827-5\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
