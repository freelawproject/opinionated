Arnold, Esq., as counsel for the plaintiffs, and the reading and filing of the affidavits,\u201d etc., referring to a number of affidavits deemed to -have been before the court, \u201cand why such other and further relief as the court may deem proper in the premises should not be granted herein.\u201d The papers upon which the order to show cause was based concededly contained no suggestion of a reason for the notice of less than five days, thereby authorized, and the objection was taken by affidavit on the part of the defendants. Notwithstanding this objection,.the court proceeded to hear the motion, and made an order, not for a reargument or resettlement, but for the vacating of the order obtained by the defendants in toto. This relief was not suggested by the order to show cause. It was different relief, not of the nature of the relief asked in a degree such as could bring it within the meaning of \u201cother and further relief,\u201d and the defendants were not apprised by the order to show cause that the application would be directed to this e\u00f1d. If, however, the court had discretion to reach such a result upon a motion before it, there was no authority for the order upon this motion, since the order to show cause was not founded upon proof of necessity for shorter notice than the period prescribed' for notice of a motion. Where the motion papers are thus defective, it is error for the court to proceed with the hearing, over objection, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>this error is of such a character as to require a reversal.
