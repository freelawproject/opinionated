It does not seem to be disputed but that the execution and delivery of the note sued on was the result of an agreement between the plaintiff\u2019s assignor and Eeander S. Sire, and that the determination of the defense set up in the answer depends upon the conversations between Sire and the officers of the plaintiff\u2019s assignor; that the officers of the plaintiff\u2019s assignor have testified to conversations with Sire, and that it is essential that the defendant should have an opportunity of denying the truth of these conversations. As the defendant is unable to procure the attendance of Sire in this state, I can see no reason why he should be deprived of Sire\u2019s testimony contradicting the testimony of the plaintiff\u2019s assignor\u2019s officers as to such conversations. There can be no question but that the court has power to issue a commission at any time before the case is finally decided, and, as the case is being tried before a referee, the only delay would be an adjournment for a few weeks until the commission to St. Louis could be returned. The defendant should, however, secure the return of the commission within 30 days of the entry of the order, and the final closings of the reference should not be delayed on account of the commission beyond that time.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-10\">It follows that the order appealed from must be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion granted. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
