After this witness had been cross-examined, the company\u2019s counsel on redirect propounded: \u201cDoctor, state whether you saw anything, after a careful examination of this plaintiff, which would prevent him from attending to his business,\u201d which question, being objected to as not proper redirect, was excluded in a prudent exercise of the discretion reposed in the court. Upon the exception then taken, and upon it alone, the appellant asks that that judgment herein be reversed. It should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b793-16\">Judgment affirmed, with costs.
