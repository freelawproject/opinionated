The order entered upon the decision of the motion provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b377-8\">\u201cOrdered that said motion to dismiss the appeal herein he granted, with ten ($10) dollars costs to the respondent, unless the appellant pays the ten ($10) dollars costs to the respondent and causes the return to he filed with 1he clerk of this court within ten days from the service of a copy of this order, with notice of entry thereof, and stipulates to argue the appeal upon the judgment herein at the March term of this court.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b377-9\">The terms of this order were not complied with, and the plaintiff respondent thereupon procured an ex parte order dismissing the appeal \u201cwith costs.\u201d In the bill of costs the clerk taxed $25 for \u201cappeal to Appellate Term,\u201d and the taxation was confirmed by the justice of the Municipal Court. The defendant appeals from so much of the judgment as awards the plaintiff $25 costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-10\">Section 345 of the Municipal Court Act, Laws 1902, p. 1590, c. 580, provides as follows: \u201c(1) If the appeal is dismissed because neither party brings it to a hearing as prescribed by law, costs shall not be awarded to either party.\u201d The appeal, as we have seen, was never brought to a hearing, and the respondent never became entitled to other than the $10 costs of motion, and disbursements, on dismissal of the 'appeal. Had the ex parte order, entered after failure of the defendant to perfect the appeal, provided for the payment of $10 costs, instead of stating \u201cwith costs,\u201d it is probable that the error in taxation would never have occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-11\">The judgment herein for $38.40 should be modified by deducting therefrom the item of $25,-and, as thus modified, affirmed, with $10 costs of this appeal to the appellant. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
