Upon succeeding to the trust estate the trustee found this amount deposited in the savings bank, and there is nothing to show, considering the small amount of the deposit, that the trustee could readify invest it so as to obtain interest at the rate of 6 per cent. It was neither improper nor improvident to permit such a small sum to remain in a perfectly safe place upon deposit and obtain interest at the same rate that was allowed by the bank upon similar amounts. We think, therefore, that the trustee was improperly charged with this item of $168.90, the difference between <em>3y2 </em>per cent., paid by the bank, and 6 per cent., with which the referee concluded that the trustee should be charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-9\">The judgment, accordingly, should be modified by reducing the same to the sum of $1,515.79, and, as so modified, affirmed, without costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
