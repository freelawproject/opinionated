Defendant was responsible. <em>Held, </em>that an order appointing a receiver, giving him access to defendant\u2019s books, and requiring defendant to sell the publication only for cash, to give a weekly account of the amount of sales and turn over their proceeds to the receiver, was too drastic.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-12\">The action was brought to restrain the defendants from publishing and selling a certain musical composition or song, and for the appointment of a receiver and 'an accounting to the plaintiffs of moneys received from such publication and sale, on the ground that the composers, James T. Brymn and Ernest Hogan, from whom the defendants obtained the composition, were, at the time of its publication and sale by them, as defendants well knew, under contract to write and compose songs exclusively for the plaintiffs. The complaint alleged that the said James T. Brymn, together with R. O. McPherson, on November 23, 1902, entered into a written contract with the plaintiffs for the term of three years from date, granting to them the exclusive right and authority to publish and sell their musical compositions, and agreeing to be in daily attendance at plaintiffs\u2019 place of business and devote themselves exclusively to musical publications of the plaintiffs, as the latter should direct, at a joint salary of $10 per week against sums due for royalties, which were stipulated, upon \"their compositions accepted and published by the plaintiffs : that the said Brymn, on February 5, 1904, individually made with plaintiffs another written contract, ratifying and confirming the first contract, and assigning two songs to plaintiffs, the latter agreeing, in addition to the money consideration, to publish and offer for sale at least two of said Brymn\u2019s compositions each year; that plaintiffs fulfilled their part of the contracts, and paid said Brymn the sum of $105, but the latter failed to attend regularly plaintiffs\u2019 office, and plaintiffs ceased to make to him further advances; that on June 4, 1903, Ernest Hogan entered into a contract with plaintiffs for the term of two years from date, granting to plaintiffs, the exclusive right to publish his compositions for due consideration, and plaintiffs have stood ready to carry out said agreement; that the said Brymn and Hogan composed the words and music of a song or composition entitled \u201cD-i-s! P-o-s! Z-e-s I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"250\">*250</page-number>Means Move,\" and In violations of their agreements aforesaid on March 27, 1904, delivered said composition to the defendant, who, with full knowledge of the contracts mentioned, published the same and offered it for sale, claiming it as its exclusive property, against the rights and protest of the plaintiffs, receiving large profits therefrom. The contracts mentioned are annexed to the-complaint, and, in addition to the provisions stated, the one made with Brymn contains the following: \u201cThe parties of the second part (plaintiffs) shall have the right to terminate and end this agreement on the first day of January or July during its continuance by giving thirty days\u2019 notice to the parties of the first part of their intention so to do * * * and upon the mailing of such notice * * * this agreement and all its provisions shall cease, terminate and end on said first day of January or July as the case may be and the parties of the second part be freed from all obligations thereof.\u201d The contract with Hogan specifies certain songs, among which the song in question is not mentioned, and then grants, in consideration of the royalties stated for such songs, \u201cthe exclusive right for two years to publish all * * * compositions,\u201d and Hogan agrees \u201cto write and compose exclusively for Jos. W. Stern &amp; Co., for said two years.\u201d Upon the pleadings and papers, including numerous affidavits denying and affirming plaintiffs\u2019 alleged rights, the Special Term, upon plaintiffs\u2019 application for a preliminary injunction, granted their motion for the appointment of a receiver, but denied injunctive relief, without requiring any undertaking. Prom the order so entered, the defendants appeal.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b283-10\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"249\">*249</page-number>Appeal from Special Term, New York County.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b283-11\">Action by Joseph W.

Before copyrighting the song or composition, the defendant sought of the plaintiffs information as to what rights if any they had with respect thereto, but its letter remained unanswered. It thus appears that the defendant purchased the song or composition without exact knowledge as to what rights, if any, the plaintiff had, and thereafter expended money in publishing the song; and it was only after it ap<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"251\">*251</page-number>peared that the sales were likely to be profitable to the defendant that this action was brought. In addition, it appears that the defendant is responsible.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-5\">By the order appealed from, the court has placed upon the defendant the burden and expense of printing and publishing the song, with the possibility of loss, and has fixed the condition that it is not to be sold in the ordinary course of business upon credit, but only for cash; and, by the requirement of furnishing weekly verified itemized statements' and giving to the receiver the right to inspect the books at his pleasure, the business of the defendant has been practically placed under the supervision of a receiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">We do not mean to say that a situation might not be presented when an order as drastic as this in terms might not be justified, but we think it should only be granted in cases where the plaintiff\u2019s right to final relief in the action is placed beyond cavil, and where no other appropriate security is afforded to the plaintiff. Upon the merits, we think it extremely doubtful as to the plaintiffs\u2019 right eventually to succeed. In the case of Stern v. Von Tilzer Music Publishing Co., Law Journal Nov. 11, 1902, where a contract similar to those here presented was involved between the plaintiff and Brymn and McPherson, it was held that such contract was \u201cunilateral and inequitable, and it is doubtful whether it can be enforced in equity.\u201d \u2022</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">It will be noticed that the contract here with Brymn and McPherson left it optional with the plaintiffs whether they would or would not publish any of the compositions of these tw\u00f3 men, and-it gave to the plaintiffs the right to terminate it either in July or January upon giving 30 days\u2019 notice. The second contract with Brymn differs, in that the plaintiffs agree to publish at least two of his compositions a year, but it will be noticed that it provides for the purchase by the plaintiffs of two songs, Brymn \u201cto write and compose exclusively for said firm\u201d for the unexpired period of about 10 months of the former contract, which, it is stated, is ratified. The provision as to purchase seemingly imposed no further obligation upon the plaintiffs, nor were the defects of the first contract now cured. The contract with Hogan does not bind the plaintiffs to publish any of his future compositions.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">We have no desire, however, to dispose of the merits of this controversy, which should be left until the trial, but we have stated enough to show that the question as to the plaintiffs\u2019 right to ultimately recover is by no means placed beyond doubt or cavil. We concur in the view of the learned judge at Special Term in denying the motion for an injunction, and,'with respect to the motion for a receiver, we think that should also have been denied. This was not a case for a receiver, and the most that plaintiffs were entitled to pendente lite was a bond or undertaking if there was any doubt of defendant\u2019s solvency or responsibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">The order, accordingly, should be reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and the motion for the appointment of a receiver denied, with $10 costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
