That court, though enumerated as a court of record, \"is only a local statutory court of inferior jurisdiction.\u201d McCann v. Gerding, 29 Misc. Rep. 283, 60 N. Y. Supp. 467. \u201cThe facts necessary to the jurisdiction will not be presumed, but must be made to appear affirmatively.\u201d Beaudrias v. Hogan, 16 App. Div. 38, 44 N. Y. Supp. 785. See, too, Gilbert v. York, 111 N. Y. 544, 19 N. E. 268. It appears from the record of the judgment roll that the affidavit of the service of the summons, with notice, is without venue. It is therefore a nullity. Thompson v. Burhans, 61 N. Y. 52, 63; Rogers v. Peli, 154 N. Y. 518, 529, 49 N. E. 75: Saril v. Payne (Com. Pl.) 4 N. Y. Supp. 897; Babcock v. Kuntzsch, 85 Hun, 33, 32 N. Y. Supp. 587. The question of any amendment (Cook v. Whipple, 55 N. Y. 150, 166,14 Am. Rep. 202) is not in this case. Even though the rule that the jurisdiction of such a court is never presumed applies only to questions of jurisdiction of the subject-matter, and that in other respects the rule as to courts of general jurisdiction obtains, as some authorities have it (Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law [2d Ed.] vol. 17, p. 1083), yet this will not avail the appellant. In Smith v. Central Trust Co., 154 N. Y. 333, 341, 48 N. E. 553, it is held that the presumptions <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"104\">*104</page-number>in support of Superior Courts of general jurisdiction only apply to such jurisdictional facts as to which the record is silent, and not otherwise; the court saying: \u201cWhen it affirmatively appears, however, that any essential step was omitted, the presumption in favor of jurisdiction is destroyed, and a presumption against jurisdiction at once arises.\u201d \u2022 \u25a0</p>\n<p id=\"b138-4\">The answer of the defendant denies the allegations of the complaint in hsec verba as \u201calleged or mentioned in the paragraph of the complaint,\u201d referring to such paragraph by its number. Though not beyond criticism as containing a negative pregnant, it may be held sufficient; certainly on appeal. Donovan v. Main, 74 App. Div. 44, 77 N. Y. Supp. 229; Wall v. The Buffalo Water Works Company, 18 N. Y. 119; Stuber v. McEntee, 142 N. Y. 200, 36 N. E. 878.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-5\">The judgment and order should be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
