J.</author>\n<p id=\"A6I\">The complaint in this action alleges, in substance, that on June 17, 1904, the plaintiff was a passenger on one of the defendant\u2019s cars, and gave the conductor a $1 bill for the purpose of paying two fares; that, the conductor failing to give her the 90 cents due her after repeated requests for the same, the plaintiff complained to one of the officials of the defendant, whereupon the conductor \u201cviolently assaulted, struck, and beat the plaintiff,causing the injuries for which she claims damages. The facts leading up to the alleged assault upon the plaintiff by the conductor are practically undisputed. The plaintiff boarded the car of the defendant at the corner of Charlton and Hudson streets, her destination being Fifty-Second \u25a0street and Eighth avenue. She gave the conductor a $1 bill, requesting him to take out 10 cents\u2014-the fare for herself and her daughter, who accompanied her. She testifies that he failed to give her back any money, and, after repeated requests therefor, she says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-9\">\u201cStill I kept asking him all along for the change until we got up to Fiftieth street, when I thought it was my duty to get out and go into the office and complain of him.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b354-10\">She further says that the car stopped at Fiftieth street, and the conductor got off, as did also the plaintiff and her daughter. The conductor went into a small office, and soon after came out, and got upon the car, which continued upon its trip. The plaintiff then testified as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b354-11\">\u201cI said to him [the starter]: \u2018Don\u2019t let that man go on the car. He owes me ninety cents.\u2019 And he didn\u2019t pay me no attention. He went right along, and shoved him right along, and the car went to Harlem, he told me. I said: \u2018Why did you let that man get on the car without giving me my change?\u2019 I said, T will have to look to you for it.\u2019 He said, \u2018In about an hour the car will come back, and, if you wait, you will get your change.\u2019 I said: \u2018That\u2019s a very long time for me to have to stand here.\u2019 Still I did it\u2014myself and my daughter. It was. long I asked the starter, was he fooling me? I-Ie said, \u2018No; it will be back directly.\u2019 Sure enough it did come back. The minute it come back, he jumped from the car and went into the small office.\u201d Q. That is on the ground floor? A.-Yes, sir. Q. You mean the conductor went there? A. The conductor\u2014the man that hit me; and I followed him right in, and I tapped him on the shoulder, and I said: \u2018When are you going to give me my ninety cents?\u2019 He wouldn\u2019t pay any attention to me.' I said: T must have my change. I won\u2019t go home until I get it.\u2019 He didn\u2019t seem to want to notice me. The young man over there said something. I couldn\u2019t gather what he said. Q. Whom did he say it to? A. To the conductor; and then the conductor, after that time, he talked. 1-Ie says: \u2018Well,\u2019 he says, T have met the like of you before.\u2019 But he says (the young man .that was in the office), \u2018How much money had you when you got on the car?\u2019 And he hemmed and hemmed, but I heard him say two dollars. He' might have said more. Q. This young man asked the conductor how much .he had? A. Yes. T suppose,\u2019 he said, T will have to give it to you.\u2019 He said: \"Tt\u2019isn\u2019t your money. It is my money. It isn\u2019t youVs, but I suppose I will give it to you. I have met the like of you before.\u2019 But he gave <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>me the money. Q. Gave you ninety cents? A. Yes, sir; and then I turned like to go out, and he gave me a terrible smash. You can look\u2014\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-5\">The conductor denied the assault, but, as the court below found in favor of the plaintiff, her version of the occurrence must, be taken as true.</p>\n<p id=\"b355-6\">This judgment is sought to be sustained upon the theory that the relation of carrier and passenger still existed between the plaintiff and the defendant at the time of the alleged assault, and that the passenger received the injuries from the misconduct of one of the servants of the defendant while engaged in performing a duty which a carrier owes to its, passengers. We think that upon neither ground can it be upheld. Possibly the case holding the carrier to the strictest accountability to its passengers, among all that line of cases, is that of Stewart v. Brooklyn &amp; Crosstown R. Co., 90 N. Y. 588, 43 Am. Rep. 185. In this and other similar cases the rule is laid down, as said in Dwindle v. N. Y. C. &amp; H. R. R. Co., 120 N. Y. 117, 126, 24 N. E. 319, 322, 8 L. R. A. 224, 17 Am. St. Rep. 611:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b355-7\">\u201cNo matter what the motive is which incites the servant of the carrier to commit an unlawful or improper act toward, the passenger, the carrier is liable for the act and its legitimate and natural consequences.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b355-8\">The relation of carrier and passenger must, however, continue to exist. In the case at bar the plaintiff, of her own volition, left the car at Fiftieth street for the purpose of making a complaint against the conductor. Although her destination was Fifty-Second street, she knew that by leaving the car she terminated her journey. At any rate, it must be conceded that as soon as she did leave the car the defendant was under no obligation to carry her further without entering another car and paying another fare, thereby restoring the severed relation of carrier and passenger. There is a plain distinction between a railroad company running a train of cars, from which a passenger alights at some point on his journey, and enters a room for the purpose of obtaining refreshments or to await the further continuance of the train,\" and is there assaulted and injured by an employ\u00e9 of the company, and a street car company, running only one car at a time, and whose passengers must continue thereon until the point of their destination is reached, and who, therefore, unless by transfer asked for and given, relinquish the right of further transportation as soon as they leave the car. That a passenger on a street car, who voluntarily leaves it at any point before he arrives at'his first intended destination, does so without any existing right to be again taken up and carried forward unless he again pays a fare, and again resumes the relation of passenger and carrier, except one who is entitled to or receives a transfer, is a fact of common knowledge, and one of which the court may take judicial notice. It is said that the plaintiff remained upon the ground or property of the defendant at the request of one of its employ\u00e9s. Such employ\u00e9 is not shown to have authority to extend such an invitation, and, if such authority existed, it is clear that the plaintiff could not still be regarded as a passenger. Here the plaintiff remained until the conductor returned from the end of his run, and the office into which she followed him was not a waiting room or room for passengers. Nor was she while there engaged in making any complaint to any officer <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>of the defendant whose duty it was to receive and investigate complaints made against the company\u2019s employ\u00e9s. The plaintiff was- merely continuing the controversy previously .had with the conductor upon the car. The relation of carrier and passenger had ended long before this. Nor was the conductor acting as such when he committed the assault. He was not engaged in any of the duties pertaining to- his employment. His trip had ended, his duties as conductor had ceased, he was upon no car, and his improper act was not committed while engaged in the performance of any duty the defendant owed to a passenger, or within the scope of his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-5\">The facts, assuming the plaintiff\u2019s testimony to be true, show ah unjustifiable assault committed upon the person\u2018of the plaintiff, for which the defendant cannot be held liable, and for a cause of action for which the Municipal Court has no jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-6\">Judgment reversed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
