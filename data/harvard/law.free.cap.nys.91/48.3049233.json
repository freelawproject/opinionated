It was a manufacturing corporation organized under the laws of the state of Ohio, and had its principal, and, so far as the state of New York is concerned, its only, office in Canton, Ohio. It employed an agent who resided in the city of New York, who sold the goods in question under the provisions of the written contract addressed to and accepted by the plaintiff in the state of Ohio, and under the authorities this was not \"doing business\u201d in the sense that that phrase is used in the statute cited. Crocker v. Muller, 40 Misc. Rep. 686, 83 N. Y. Supp. 189; Vaughn Machine Co. v. Lighthouse, 64 App. Div. 138, 71 N. Y. Supp. 799; Droege v. Ahrens &amp; Ott Mfg. Co., 163 N. Y. 466, 471, 472, 57 N. E. 747, and authorities there cited; The Hargraves Mills v. Harden, 25. Misc. Rep. 665, 56 N. Y. Supp. 937; Cooper Manufacturing Co. v. Ferguson, 113 U. S. 727, 5 Sup. Ct. 739, 28 L. Ed. 1137. The plaintiff was not doing business in this state in the sense contemplated by the statute, and, as the complaint appears to have been dismissed upon an erroneous theory, the judgment cannot stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">The judgment appealed from should be reversed, and a new trial ordered; costs to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
