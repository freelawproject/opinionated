D., 1893. George Cuyler. [L. 8.]\u2019 \u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"46\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b726-13\">After the death of George N. Cuyler his administratrix brought an action \u25a0against the Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance Company upon the policy. Upon motion of the defendant in that action the executors of the last will and testament of George Cuyler, deceased, were impleaded. Upon the facts as thus stipulated, the trial judge had held as conclusion of law that George M. oCuyler was at the time of his death the owner and holder of said policy of life insurance in the Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance Company, and that the plaintiff, as his administratrix, was entitled to the moneys due thereupon. To that decision exceptions were duly filed by the executors of George Cuyler. Judgment was entered upon the decision, and from that judgment this appeal is taken.</summary>\n<p data-order=\"47\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b726-14\">Argued before PARKER, P. J., and SMITH, CHASE, CHESTER, and HOUGHTON, JJ.</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"48\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b726-15\">Peter A. Delaney, for appellants.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b726-16\">Mark Cohn, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b726-17\">SMITH, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AW1\">The trial judge properly held that the administrator of George N. Cuyler was entitled to the moneys due upon the policy. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number>failure of the executors of George Cuyler to include the policy among the assets of their testator is evidence of the fact that the assignment of the policy was not found among such assets. Under the stipulation that assignment was executed in duplicate, one of the copies having been filed with the insurance company. The other copy was delivered to George Cuyler. The policy having been once shown to be^ legally owned by George Cuyler, there is a legal presumption of the continuance of ownership until some evidence be offered of its retransfer to George N. Cuyler. The possession of the policy itself by George N. Cuyler before the death of his father' is not, in my judgment, alone sufficient to rebut the presumption of continuance of ownership of the policy by his father. When in addition to that possession, however, is shown the failure of the executors of George Cuyler to find among his papers the assignment which was once delivered to him, a legal inference would fairly seem to follow that that assignment had been destroyed, and the policy retransferred by the father to the son. This is sufficient, in my judgment, to establish a prima facie case of ownership in the son, and, in the absence of other evidence, is sufficient to sustain the conclusion of the trial justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">The judgment should therefore be affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
