J.</author>\n<p id=\"Aql\">At the close of the plaintiff\u2019s case the defendant offered no proof, but moved for a dismissal upon the ground \u201cthat there is no proof of service of the substituted service, and a failure to comply with section 34 of the Municipal Court Act (Daws 1902, p. 1501, c. 580). This .action was commenced by substituted service of the papers. So far as it appears before the court, there is no proof before this court as to when the affidavit and order were filed.\u201d This motion was denied, and judgment rendered for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b356-21\">The only indorsement on the summons or on any of the papers are the words and figures, \u201cCal. fee paid 4-12-04.\u201d Section 34 requires <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"323\">*323</page-number>that \u201cthe order and the papers upon which it is granted must be filed and the service must be made -not less than six days before the return day of the summons, otherwise the order becomes inoperative.\u201d In the case of Dalton v. Mills, a somewhat similar case (Feb. 1904; Appellate Term) 91 N. Y. Supp. 733, this court held that \u201cit devolved upon the plaintiff herein'to show that he had complied with all the requirements of the statute, in order to confer jurisdiction upon the court over the person or the subject-matter of the action.\u201d Here the plaintiff\u2019s attention was called to the defect in his proof. He made no attempt to supply it. It is too late now to say it could easily have been done. The fact is it was not done, and the words before referred to, indorsed upon one of the alias summons issued herein, without signature or any evidence of filing, is insufficient to prove the requisite jurisdictional fact necessary to be shown as a compliance with said section of the municipal court act.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-5\">The question of jurisdiction can be raised at any time. O\u2019Reilly v. N. B. A. &amp; N. Y. S. S. Co., 28 Misc. 112, 59 N. Y. Supp. 261. Davidsburgh v. Knickerbocker L. I. Co., 90 N. Y. 526.</p>\n<p id=\"b357-6\">Judgment reversed. New trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
