The trial justice, however, rendered judgment for $216.66, which, in view of a conceded and admitted liability of only $66.66 on a promissory note, the subject of the first cause of action, exceeds concession and proof by $33.34. The judgment must therefore be reduced by subtracting such excess, and adjusting the costs in conformity to the provisions of subdivision 2 of section 332 of the Municipal Court Act (Laws 1902, p. 1585, c. 580).</p>\n<p id=\"b803-10\">Judgment modified as directed, and, as modified, affirmed, without costs of this appeal to either party.
