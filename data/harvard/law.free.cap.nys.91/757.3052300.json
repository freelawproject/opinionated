Blood &amp; Green, 9 Wend. 268, 24 Am. Dec. 143), this is to be treated as prima facie evidence of negligence.\u201d Claflin v. Meyer, <em>75 </em>N. Y. 260, 262, 31 Am. Rep. 467. Herein, however, the defendant, by his employ\u00e9, a wagon boy, testified to their delivery to the receiving clerk of the Jacobson Skirt Company, and the return of the receipt book to the shipping clerk of the plaintiffs. On the other hand, one Jacobson <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"758\">*758</page-number>testified that he did not know whether he was at his place o\u00ed business on February 3d; that four young men were employed by him; that he never received the goods; that he knew, of his own knowledge, that the goods were not received, by having gone through the different orders; and that 10 or 12 days later they looked for the goods, but could not find them in stock. This, the only\u2014may-hap slight\u2014evidence of nondelivery, may not be said to be of weight with the positive testimony of the wagon boy; nor was there so much as attempt at flat contradiction, by calling, as they might, the receiving clerk of the consignee. But the shipping clerk of the plaintiffs positively denied ever having received the receipt book, or any receipt back, from that boy for those goods. In this material particular the jury may have believed the clerk and disbelieved the boy, and so have disregarded the testimony of the latter\u2014quite within their province\u2014as their verdict in favor of the plaintiffs would seem to, indicate, and the judgment entered thereon must stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b792-5\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
