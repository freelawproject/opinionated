Winslow &amp; Co., brokers, with whom the defendants had had no prior dealings, wrote to the latter: \u201cWe shall be pleased to receive your lowest quotation on 1,000 dozen choice quality 1901 packing gall\u00f3n apples,\u201d and defendants replied, July 31,1901: \u201cYours of 30th reed. In reply will say that we will sell gallon apples 1901 pack $2.25 per doz. f. o. b. N\u201e Y.\u201d The brokers, acting for the plaintiff, then telegraphed defendants, \u201cLetter received. Sold 1,000 dozen gallon apples future, your price, choice quality, see mail;\u201d and made out bought and sold notes stating the quantity, quality, and price of the goods, to be \u201cdelivered on dock \u2022 New York City,\u201d and expressing the terms of payment to be 60 days, with a discount in 10 days. The \u201csold\u201d note was forwarded to the defendants, who, replying, made certain criticisms as to the meaning of the terms of shipment, sending at the same time a form of contract of their own for the purchaser\u2019s acceptance, which embodied'a further condition that delivery should depend upon the state of the apple crop, and omitted the description \u201cchoice quality.\u201d To this the brokers answered: \u201cYou are in error regarding'shipment to N. Y\u201e, via rail, as in my contract it is optional with you to ship the goods any way you choose, either by water or rail, only land them in N. Y. City. In contract you send me you do not state choice quality, so send me the contract we sent you accepted and we will secure the one given buyer by us accepted. Although, if you wish, contracts can remain as they are and be binding on all.\u201d Nothing further was done by the defendants, and upon the trial the question was left to the jury whether the minds of the parties had met; a motion for dismissal, upon the ground that there was no contract, having been denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b59-4\">_ In our opinion, the motion should have been granted, and the verdict is without evidence to support it. Undoubtedly, where all the essentials of a contract are covered by correspondence, looking merely to a formal execution of a written agreement, the refusal of one to sign the agreement does not affect the other\u2019s right to enforce the actual contract as evidenced by the correspondence; but such is not the present situation. The brokers\u2019 letter asked for a price upon gallon apples \u201cchoicg quality,\u201d and the defendants gave a price for \u201cgallon apples.\u201d So far, of course, there was no contract, but an acceptance of the defendants\u2019 offer, as tendered, would have made one. The form adopted by the plaintiff for the acceptance of the defendants\u2019 proposal to sell, if it added nothing to that proposal, would have been sufficient; but, if new terms were thereby imported, the making of a contract was still deferred to the defendants\u2019 acceptance of the new terms. Mahar v. Compton, 18 App. Div. 540, 541, 45 N. Y. Supp. 1126; Barrow S. S. Co. v. M. C. R Co., 134 N. Y. 15, 31 N. E. 261, 17 L. R. A. 359. The defendants merely offered to sell \u201cgallon apples, 1901 pack,\u201d and the plaintiff, through the brokers, was at liberty to accept that offer, without more, for the purpose of binding the seller. The broker\u2019s telegram of acceptance, however, added a term not included in the offer, a warranty of \u201cchoice quality,\u201d and the sold note contained the condition, \u2018Goods \u2022to be of choice quality, cans full, and fruit of good color and firm.\u201d This <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"26\">*26</page-number>condition the defendants refused to accept, and proposed a form of contract omitting the words \u201cchoice quality,\u201d which the brokers in turn refused to adopt. Apart from any question as to the terms of shipment and payment, there was thus a failure of any concluded agreement, since assent to the broker\u2019s terms could not be implied from the defendants\u2019 subsequent silence and nonaction. Hough v. Brown, 19 N. Y. 111. There was therefore nothing to submit to the jury, in view of the legal effect of the admitted facts, and the denial of the motion for the dismissal of the complaint was error.</p>\n<p id=\"b60-5\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
