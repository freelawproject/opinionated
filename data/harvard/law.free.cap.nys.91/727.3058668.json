The record discloses that the defendant (appellant) upon his own application was in due course individually adjudicated a bankrupt, and as such discharged; but \u201cin order to secure a discharge from firm debts there must be an adjudication of the firm as bankrupt, and a firm trustee appointed, where there are firm assets.\u201d In re Meyers, 3 Am. Bankr. Rep. 260, 261, 97 Fed. 757. That not appearing, nor made so to appear by the affidavit of the appellant, \u201cupon information and belief that said claim was provable in the proceedings in bankruptcy, and your deponent was discharged therefrom by the discharge granted therein,\u201d the justice below properly denied his application, for it is only \u201cif it appears upon the hearing that he has been discharged from the payment of that judgment or the debt upon which such judgment was recovered an order must be made directing said judgment be canceled and discharged of record.\u201d Code Civ.
