Defendant also filed a partial defense alleging that plaintiff, with full knowledge of defendant\u2019s works, long after they were constructed and operated by defendant, purchased his premises to compel defendant to purchase the same from plaintiff at an increased price. <em>Held, </em>that such defenses were demurrable.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b163-10\">3.

These facts, if established on the trial, would undoubtedly constitute a nuisance. Roscoe Lumber Co. v. Standard Silica Co., 62 App. Div. 421, 422, 70 N. Y. Supp. 1130, and authority there cited. The defendant, answering, denies all the allegations going to the essence of the cause of action, and sets up \u201cfor a first separate and distinct defense thereto\u201d that \u201cthe defendant\u2019s business or works is lawful, and is a great benefit, utility, and convenience*to the public, and is rightfully carried on in a proper, suitable, and convenient place, and in a careful and orderly manner, and in the best and most improved manner.\u201d For a second separate and distinct defense thereto the defendant alleges \u201cthat it is amply able to respond in damages, and that the plaintiff has an adequate remedy at law.\u201d As a partial defense the defendant sets forth, in substance, that the plaintiff, with a full knowledge of the defendant\u2019s works, etc., and a long time after such works were constructed and operated by the defendant, purchased the said premises mentioned in the complaint for the purpose of compelling the defendant to purchase the same from the plaintiff at an advanced and increased\" price.</p>\n<p id=\"b164-5\">The plaintiff demurred generally to these two defenses and to the partial defense, and the learned court at Special Term held that the demurrer as to the first defense and as to the partial defense was good, but held that, as the demurrer was general, and the second defense was sufficient in law, the same must be overruled. We are convinced that the court was correct in its view of the first defense and the partial defense, and the only question to be determined here is whether the defense that the defendant is \u201camply able to respond in damages, and that the plaintiff has an adequate remedy at law,\u201d is a good defense to the cause of action set out in the complaint.. While the complaint does not allege in direct language that the defendant intends to continue to operate its plant in such a manner as to constitute a nuisance, the prayer for relief assumes this, and the attitude of the defendant in its answer is that it has a right to continue as it has been doing. The action is therefore one of equitable cognizance, as it is a well-recognized principle of equity jurisprudence that a continuing trespass gives ground for injunctive relief to prevent a multiplicity of actions. If the defendant\u2019s plant, with its mode of operation, constitutes a nuisance, it gives rise to a new cause of action each day that it is so operated, and the recovery of daily damages is not an adequate remedy for one whose rights of property are continually invaded. The complaint being purely of an equitable nature, and in which only equitable relief <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>can be afforded, a defense that the plaintiff has an adequate remedy at law is insufficient, and its insufficiency can be raised by demurrer. Edmonds v. Stern, 89 App. Div. 539, 540, 85 N. Y. Supp. 665.</p>\n<p id=\"b165-3\">The interlocutory judgment should be modified, with costs, and the demurrer sustained, without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
