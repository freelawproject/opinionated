The contract, as alleged, is that on about May <em>21, </em>. 1882, \u201cin consideration that the plaintiff, who was then a sole and unmarried woman, at the request of the defendant, agreed\" and would marry him on such request, the defendant promised the plaintiff to so <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"451\">*451</page-number>marry her on his request.\u201d It is further alleged that after the making of the said promise and undertaking of the defendant, to wit, on the 20th day of March, 1902, and at divers other places, the plaintiff requested the defendant to marry her, but .the defendant, disregarding his promise and undertaking, did not nor would he at any time before or after marry her; and the plaintiff demands judgment for $50,000. The complaint was demurred to upon the ground that it did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action. This demurrer was overruled, and the defendant appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">The only promise of the defendant alleged is that he would \u201cso marry her [the plaintiff] on his [the defendant\u2019s] request.\u201d I am inclined to think that this contract lacks the mutuality which is necessary to support a contract based upon mutual promises of the parties. Thus, in the Encyclopaedia of Eaw &amp; Procedure (vol. 9, p. 327), it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-6\">\u201cThere are many cases in which, although the offer is definite enough, yet the accepter, by .merely accepting, has really himself promised nothing in return\u2014has not made himself liable for anything\u2014so that, although one is bound, the other is not, and the engagement lacks what is called \u2018mutuality.\u2019 In such a case there is not an enforceable agreement.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-7\">And the author states many illustrations of contracts that are void for want of the mutuality required.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-8\">In Am. &amp; Eng. Enc. of Law ([2d Ed.] vol. 7,.p. 114) it is said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-9\">\u201cClosely related to the doctrine of consideration is the rule as to the mutuality of contract. \u2018Mutuality of contract\u2019 means that an obligation must rest on each party to do or permit to be done something in consideration of the act or promise of the other; .that is, neither party is bound unless both are bound.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-10\">In Tucker v. Woods, 12 Johns. 190, 7 Am. Dec. 305, it was said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b485-11\">\u201cIn contracts, where the promise of the one party is the consideration for the promise of the other, the promises must be concurrent and obligatory upon both at the same time.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b485-12\">To entitle the plaintiff to maintain this action, there must be alleged a valid contract. Where the consideration of a contract is based upon mutual promises, to make the contract enforceable there must be the obligations of both parties to it; and thus, to hold the defendant, it must appear that he promised to do something. What was it that the defendant promised? He promised to marry the plaintiff at his request, or, in other words, that he would marry her when he made a request that she marry him. This was, in substance, a mere option to marry the plaintiff, without any corresponding obligation on his part to marry her, and there was therefore no mutuality in the promise which can sustain the contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b485-13\">I think that the judgment appealed from should be reversed, with costs, and the demurrer sustained, with costs, with leave to the plaintiff to amend upon payment of costs in this court and.in the court below. All concur except HATCH, J., who dissents.</p>\n<author id=\"b485-14\">HATCH, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AA8\">I am unable to agree with the conclusion reached by the court in this case. It may be conceded that the averment of the contract to marry is not only inartificially stated, but is ambiguous in statement to a degree that nearly works its annihilation. I think, how<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"452\">*452</page-number>ever, that a contract to marry may be spelled out of the language used, and that a breach of the contract is averred. The prevailing opinion proceeds upon the ground that the contract stated in the complaint lacks mutuality of promise, and is therefore insufficient to constitute it an enforceable contract. The language of the averment is: \u201cThat on or about May 21,1882, in consideration that the plaintiff, who was then a sole and unmarried woman, at the request of the defendant, agreed and would marry him on such request.\u201d Stopping here, the averment is that the defendant requested the plaintiff to marry him, and upon such request she agreed to marry him. There is here a clear mutuality of promise stated\u2014upon defendant\u2019s part, the request to marry; and upon the plaintiff\u2019s part, an acceptance of such request. There could not, therefore, -be a more complete mutuality of promise than is to be fairly gathered from this language. Does the succeeding part of the paragraph destroy this averment of mutual promise ? It reads, \u201cthe defendant promised the plaintiff to so marry her on his request.\u201d What request? Evidently the first\u2014that the defendant would marry the plaintiff upon the request which he had made, and which she had accepted. Considering the whole of the paragraph together, it is susceptible of the construction that the defendant requested the plaintiff to marry him, that she accepted, and that upon such request and its acceptance he promised the plaintiff to marry her upon the request to marry which he had made. It would seem to follow, therefore, that the last clause does not destroy the first, but is in harmony with it, and is in fact a mere confirmation of the original request, which it is averred was accepted and acted upon. If the complaint be susceptible of this construction\u2014and I think it is\u2014there is expressed mutuality of-promise, and a valid contract is susceptible of being deduced therefrom. The construction of such a pleading, even though it be conceded that a different conclusion might be reached, is to adopt the construction which will support it. 4 Ency. Pleading &amp; Prac. 744, and cases cited. As it is capable of a construction which expresses a valid contract to marry, it is sufficient to resist the demurrer.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">The interlocutory judgment should therefore be affirmed, with costs, and the defendant be given leave to plead over within 20 days upon the payment of costs in this court and in the court below.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
