His application to open the default was based upon an affidavit <em>o\u00ed </em>merits, and also upon the affidavit made by the attorney in which the following statements are not disputed in the opposing affidavits: The case was called for trial on June 6th, and, after proceeding for some time, the court ordered an adjournment until the following day. The defendant\u2019s attorney stated at the time this adjournment was directed that he would be engaged the following morning in the Seventh District Court,, and the court thereupon stated that the case would be held until defendant\u2019s attorney got through with his other engagement. On the morning of June 7th the defendant\u2019s attorney arrived at the place of trial about 11:30 a. m., and outside the courthouse met the plaintiff and his attorney, who stated that a judgment had been taken against the defendant by default. Defendant\u2019s attorney at once asked the plaintiff\u2019s attorney to open the case, and stated that he would immediately proceed with the trial, but this plaintiff\u2019s attorney declined to do. It <em>is </em>probable that the court, on the case being called on June 7th, failed to recollect the engagement of counsel, and the plaintiff proceeded with the testimony on his part, and obtained a judgment. Under these circumstances the interests of justice will be best subserved by granting a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
