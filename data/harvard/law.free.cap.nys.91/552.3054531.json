The judgment, however, may be modified on this appeal. Section 310, Id.; Christiansen v. Mendham, 45 App. Div. 554, 61 N. Y. Supp. 326; <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>Fitzhugh v. Wiman, 9 N. Y. 559. The defendants, under their answer of title in a third person, were entitled to offer evidence of the title of Walker, and consequently to call Walker as a witness, irrespective of the fact that Walker had not availed himself of the provisions of section 115a of the Municipal Court act (Laws 1903, p. 1016, c. 431), for that section, in our opinion, does not affect or limit section 117. The omission of the defendants to pray judgment for a return does not preclude them from any subsequent action to regain possession thereof, pf course subordinate to the title of Walker. Brady v. Beadleston, 62 Hun, 548, 17 N. Y. Supp. 42: Shepherd v. Moodhe, 8 Misc. Rep. 607, 29 N. Y. Supp. 392.</p>\n<p id=\"b587-5\">The judgment should be modified so as to be for the defendants on the merits, with $15 costs, and, as modified, it should be affirmed, without costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
