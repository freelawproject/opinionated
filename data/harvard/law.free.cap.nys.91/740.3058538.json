The material parts of said complaint, so far as the question now involved is concerned, are as follows:</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"15\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b774-21\">\u201cFirst. That heretofore, and in or about the month of July, 1904, at Sara-toga Springs, Saratoga county, N. Y., the defendant offered to sell to plaintiff a- certain team of horses, consisting of two horses, and then and there falsely and fraudulently represented that said horses, and each of them, were sound, free from fault, seven (7) and eight (8) years of age, respectively, and correct in every respect.\u201d</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"16\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b774-22\">\u201cFourth. That one of said horses was not sound or free from fault, nor correct in every respect, but was unsound, unkind, and was older than seven or eight years of age; that said horse\u2019s feet were contracted, and said horse was lame and unsound, and had wind puffs on every leg, and splint on forward leg; that said horse had been blistered for lameness or other disease.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"17\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b774-23\">\u201cFifth. That the other one of said horses was much older than seven or eight years, had and has splints, is puffed on legs, and has had for some time wtiat deponent, on information and belief, alleges to be a bone spavin.\u201d</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b774-24\">Plaintiff alleges that the horses were worth $410 less than they would have been as represented by the defendant, and that he has necessarily spent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"741\">*741</page-number>S3 25 in caring for and endeavoring to cure said horses, and demands j\u00fadgment for $535.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"12\" data-type=\"history\" id=\"b774-18\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"740\">*740</page-number>Appeal from Special Term, Saratoga County.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"13\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b774-19\">Action by Isidore Newman against Walter West.

He admits that \u201csaid horses were more than seven and eight years of age; that one of said horse\u2019s feet were somewhat contracted, and said horse had wind puffs on his legs, and splints on forward legand that the other of said horses had splints and puffs on its legs.\u201d He further alleges that whatever defects existed in said horses were apparent, open, and plainly visible at the time of the sale, and were known to the plaintiff\u2019s wife, who acted for the plaintiff in making the sale, and that the plaintiff purchased said horses with knowledge of all the defects existing in either of said horses.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b775-6\">It further appears that subsequent to the commencement of this action the defendant, with the permission of the plaintiff, and with the aid of two veterinary surgeons, had examined said horses for the purpose of ascertaining what defects or faults existed in them.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"22\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b775-7\">The notice of motion specified the particulars which the defendant asked that the plaintiff should be required to furnish him. The court denied the motion, and from the order entered thereon this appeal is taken.</headnotes>\n<p data-order=\"23\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b775-8\">Argued before PARKER, P. J., and SMITH, CHASE, CPIESTER, and HOUGHTON, JJ. '</p>\n<attorneys data-order=\"24\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b775-9\">Horace E. McKnight (John E\". Henning, of counsel), for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys data-order=\"25\" data-type=\"attorneys\" id=\"b775-10\">Rockwood &amp; Salisbury (George R. Salisbury, of counsel), for respondent.</attorneys>\n<opinion data-order=\"26\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-1\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b775-11\">CHASE, J.</author>\n<p id=\"AiaW\">Plaintiff insists that the defendant\u2019s answer is practically a general denial, and that consequently he is not entitled to a bill of particulars. When an answer contains only admissions and denials, it may be a good reason for denying a motion made by the plaintiff to compel a bill of particulars by the defendant. King v. Ross, 21 App. Div. 475, 47 N. Y. Supp. 562; Gray v. Shepard (Sup.) 13 N. Y. Supp. 27; Stanley v. Block, 56 App. Div. 549, 67 N. Y. Supp. 471. But such an answer cannot adversely affect the question as to \u25a0whether the plaintiff should furnish a bill of particulars to the defendant. In an action for fraud, unless the defendant denies the fraud charged in the complaint, a bill of particulars of the plaintiff\u2019s claim should not be ordered. In this case the defendant, in his answer and amended answer, both of which were read by him at the Special Term, denied the fraud charged in the plaintiff\u2019s complaint, but such denials are not repeated by the defendant in his affidavit. Where the denials in a defendant\u2019s answer are clear and specific, I see no reason, notwithstanding the expression in the opinion in Gridley v. Gridley, 7 Civ. Proc. R. 215, for holding that such denials, because they are in a verified answer, and not in a separate affidavit, are insufficient to meet the requirements on a motion for a bill of particulars. It is the substance, merit, and good faith of the denials that should influence the court in determining whether a bill of particulars should be ordered, rather than the name of the paper in which they are contained. B37 the Code of Civil Procedure it is provided that in construing such Code the word \u201caffidavit\u201d includes a verified pleading in an action, or a verified petition or answer in a- special proceeding. Section 3343, subd. 11. When the complaint and answer are verified, the facts therein stated have equal significance and importance as if stated in an affidavit. Blatchford v. N. Y. &amp; N. H. R. Co., 7 Abb. Prac. 322.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"742\">*742</page-number>By the fourth and fifth paragraphs of the complaint, it is impossible to tell which of the two horses sold to the plaintiff by the defendant were defective in the particulars in said paragraphs stated. The defendant purchased said horses separately, and it is important for him to know which horse is referred to in each of said paragraphs.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-5\">The defendant\u2019s motion for a bill of particulars should be granted to the extent of requiring the plaintiff to specify which horse he refers to in each of said paragraphs of the complaint. The defendant is also entitled to a bill of particulars of the several amounts paid by him in caring for and endeavoring to cure said horses, with the name of the person or persons to whom such amounts were so paid.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-6\">Order reversed, with $10 costs and disbursements, and motion granted. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
