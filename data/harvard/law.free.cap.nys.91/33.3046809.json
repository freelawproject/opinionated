Proc. \u00a7 814, providing that where a- bond has been given in the course of an action to the people or to a public officer for the benefit of a party, and provision is not specially made for the prosecution thereof, the party may maintain an action in his own name for a breach of condition upon procuring an order granting leave.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b68-6\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"34\">*34</page-number><em>3. </em>Same.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b68-7\">The averment of the complaint that the undertaking ran to the plaintiff\u2019s assignor is rendered nugatory by the annexation of the instrument, which runs to the county clerk, and the form of the instrument controls over the pleader\u2019s conclusion as to its legal effect.</headnotes>\n<summary data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-8\">Appeal from City Court of New York, Special Term.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b68-9\">Action by Louis Goldstein against Lena Michelspn and others.

The appellants raise the point that the complaint is insufficient, and correctly, as we view the case. The action is brought upon an undertaking running to the clerk of the county of New York, given to procure the discharge of a mechanic\u2019s lien filed by the plaintiff\u2019s assignor; the undertaking being annexed to and made a part of the complaint. The obligation thus being one which the plaintiff or his assignor could not enforce without some statutory authority, because running to some other person, the cause of action depends upon compliance with the statute which permits an action, by the individual interested, upon a-bond or undertaking running to a public officer (section 814, Code Civ. Proc.; Ringle v. W. T. Wks., 16 Misc. Rep. 167, 38 N. Y. Supp. 875; In re John P. Kane Co. [Sup.] 66 N. Y. Supp. 684, affirmed 52 App. Div. 630, 65 N. Y. Supp. 1136); and therefore the obtaining of leave to sue\u2014the condition imposed by section 814 of the Code\u2014was an essential fact which the plaintiff was bound to allege for the purposes of a statement of a cause of action (18 Abb. N. C. 149, note).</p>\n<p id=\"b68-14\">The averment of the complaint that the undertaking ran to the plaintiff\u2019s assignor is rendered nugatory by the annexation of the instrument, which runs to the county clerk, and the form of the instrument controls over the pleader\u2019s conclusion as to its legal effect. Bogardus v. Ins. Co., 101 N. Y. 328, 4 N. E. 522.</p>\n<p id=\"b68-15\">In the absence of an allegation that leave to sue had been obtained, the complaint afforded no basis for judgment upon the pleadings, and the judgment must therefore be reversed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
