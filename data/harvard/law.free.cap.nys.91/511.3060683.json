He has not attempted to exercise the inconsistent rights of enjoying the fruits of the order and at the same time appealing from it as erroneous. Quite the reverse. He asks that the alleged benefit of the order be not forced upon him so precipitously as to imperil a privilege which he seems to esteem more.highly\u2014his right to appeal. The order of the trial court did not present to the plaintiff the alternatives of appealing, or of stipulating for a reduction in the verdict, but rather of stipulating or of permitting the verdict to be set aside. In the case of Bennett v. Van Syckel, 18 N. Y. 481, the defendant had taken proceedings to obtain certain moneys deposited in court pursuant to the judgment from another part of which he had appealed, and he had also proceeded upon an indemnity bond executed and filed by the plaintiff pursuant to that judgment. It was held that the election to take these proceedings to enforce the part of the judgment which was in his favor operated as a waiver of his right to appeal from those portions of the judgment which were against him. So in Knapp v. Brown, 45 N. Y. 207, where the plaintiff had issued execution on the part of the judgment rendered in his favor, and had collected the amount thereof, it was held that his right to appeal from the judgment had been waived. And in Alexander v. Alexander, 104 N. Y. 643, 10 N. E. 37, the plaintiff, after perfecting an appeal, accepted and retained <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>a portion of the proceeds of a partition sale awarded him by the judgment appealed from. His appeal was dismissed. In all of this line of cases the rule relied upon by the defendants has been applied only where the party appealing has accepted some substam tial benefit under the judgment appealed from. But this plaintiff has done nothing of the kind. Nor is it true, in any proper sense, that he is seeking by this appeal to \u201cgain the right to recover more without incurring the hazard of recovering less,\u201d as was said in the Alexander Case, supra, page 645, 104 N. Y., page 39, 10 N. E. He has appealed from the entire order. The appellate court may dispose of the case in any of the various ways mentioned in section 1317 of the Code of Civil Procedure. He may \u201crecover more,\u201d and the possibility of \u201crecovering less\u201d is not a remote one. The plaintiff has his right of appeal, and a rule which would invest the order of the trial court with such finality, in whole or in part, as would cut off this right, would be a highly improper one. In the authorities above cited it was the affirmative act of the appealing parties that worked the waiver, not the judgments or orders themselves. The very act which the defendants demand that the plaintiff shall perform has been held sufficient to defeat a right to appeal. In Sperry v. Heilman (Com. Pl.) 13 N. Y. Supp. 271, a plaintiff who had stipulated that the amount of a judgment be reduced to a specified sum, pursuant to the direction of the General Term, was held to have thereby waived his right to take a further appeal to the Court of Appeals. It will work no hardship to the defendants if the plaintiff retains his right to stipulate for a reduction until after the determination of the cross-appeals; while the defendants\u2019 contention that they may properly accept the obvious benefit of that part of the order which requires the plaintiff to stipulate, and at the same time prosecute an appeal from the remainder of the order, suggests an anomaly which is made more striking by their argument against the plaintiff\u2019s rights in the matter. We think the order was granted by the Special Term in the proper exercise of the discretion, and should not be disturbed. See Patterson v. Hare, 74 Hun, 269, 26 N. Y. Supp. 626.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-5\">The order should be affirmed, with $10 costs and disbursements.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-6\">HIRSCHBERG, P.
