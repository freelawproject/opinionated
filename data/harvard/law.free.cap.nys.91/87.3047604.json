Railroad Law, art. 4, \u00a7 98 (Laws 1890, p. 1112, c. 565, as amended Laws 1892, p. 1404, c. 676, \u00a7 98), provides that every street railroad shall keep in repair the street between its tracks, under the supervision of the local authorities, and that on neglect to pave or repair, after notice, the authorities may do so at the expense of the corporation. After the enactment of section 98, under an ordinance of the Rochester city council, the city ratified the location of all lines of the railroad company, and it was provided that the provisions of article 4 of the railroad law should be complied with, but that all agreements between the city and the railroad company should remain in full force, and the railroad company was required to give free passage to firemen and policemen, which it had not previously been required to do. <em>Held, </em>that the street railroad company did not by such contract assent to a right of the city to exact payment from the railroad for paving between its rails, since the provision as to the railroad law was modified by the provision that all agreements should continue in force, and the provisions for furnishing transportation had no consideration, except the approval of the location of the railroad and its tracks as the same were then used and operated.</headnotes>\n<headnotes data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"headnotes\" id=\"b121-12\">3.

City of Rochester, 157 N. T. 33, 51 N.

The route described in the articles of association of the Rochester City &amp; Brighton Railroad Company is identical with certain of the routes described in the articles of association of the defendant. On or about the 24th day of June, 1862, the common council of the city of Rochester, in the exercise of the authority conferred upon it by the general railroad law of 1850, consented to the construction by the Rochester City &amp; Brighton Railroad Company of a street surface railroad upon the routes designated in its articles of association, and one of the conditions of the grant was that the grantee should improve with suitable materials, as required by the common council of the city, and in a proper manner, between its tracks, the rails of its tracks, and for two feet four inches outside thereof, and should keep the surface of the street inside the rails, and for two feet four inches outside thereof, in good repair. Thereafter, and on the 8th day of July, 1862, the Rochester City <em>&amp; </em>Brighton Railroad Company duly adopted the grant, subject to the provisions and restrictions therein contained. On or about the 16th day of October, 1862, the Rochester City &amp; Brighton Railroad Company mortgaged its rights, privileges, property, and franchises to Hobart E. Atkinson, as trustee. This mortgage was duly foreclosed, and at the foreclosure sale the rights, privileges, property, and franchises of the Rochester City &amp; Brighton Railroad Company were purchased by one Chauncey B. Woodworth. After the acceptance of said franchise from the city of Rochester, and before default in the fulfillment of the conditions of said mortgage, the said Rochester City &amp; Brighton Railroad Company proceeded to and did construct its said railroad in a number of the streets named in the said resolution of the common council and in its articles of association, and thereafter it operated its cars thereon, and duly complied with all the provisions of said ordinance. On or about March 5, 1868, pursuant to the statutes of the state, Mr. Woodworth duly associated with himself as such purchaser certain persons, and duly incorporated a company by the name of the \u201cRochester City &amp; Brighton Railroad Company,\u201d for the purpose of operating the railroad theretofore operated by its predecessor corporation, the Rochester City &amp; Brighton Railroad Company. By the terms of these last articles of association the company was to continue for 99 years.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"18\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"AS0\">Immediately after the incorporation of the new corporation, known as the \u201cRochester City &amp; Brighton Railroad Company,\u201d by the purchaser and his associates, the new company petitioned the common eouilcil, protesting against the onerous condition of the resolution of 1862, above quoted, and setting forth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>the inability of the new corporation to proceed with the operation of the railroad subject to such conditions, and the fact that the road had never paid, owing to the existence of such conditions. Thereafter,' and for the space of upwards of a year, the question was debated in the common council, committees appointed, and various hearings had, and proofs offered by the company as to the expense of building, maintaining, and' operating the road, and finally the common council, on the 12th day of January, 1869, duly amended section 2 of the ordinance of 1862, so as to read as follows: \u201cThe track of said railroad shall be laid so as to permit the free passage of vehicles and carriages over the same, and the rails shall be laid even with the surface of the streets and shall conform to the grades thereof as now established, or as they shall from time to time be established or altered.

The said act provides as follows: \u201cSec. 5. Said company shall put, keep and maintain the surface of the streets inside the rails of its tracks in good and thorough repair, under the direction of the committee on streets and bridges of the common council of said city of Rochester; and whenever any of said streets are by ordinance or otherwise permanently improved, said company shall not be required to make any part or portion of such improvement, or bear any part of the expense thereof, but shall make its rails in \u25a0such street or streets conform to the grade thereof.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"20\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"ALfT\">Thereafter the said Rochester City &amp; Brighton Railroad Company continued to maintain and operate its street surface railroad under the general statutes of the state of New York, and, with the consent of the common council, extend its railroad into many other streets and parts of streets in the city of Rochester, incurring thereby large expenses, and expending large sums \u00f3f money therefor, the exact amount of which does not appear. The company kept in repair the pavement as required, but whenever a street was improved by a new pavement it was not called upon by the authorities of the city of Rochester to make or pay for any part of such' improvement. On the 18th day of May, 1880, the common council of the city of Rochester re-enacted the ordinance of 1862, as amended in 1869.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"21\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"Ajzk\">On the 29th day of March, 1887, the common council of the city passed an ordinance in relation to street railroads, section 2 of which ordinance is as follows: \u201cSee. 2.

That thereafter, and in the years 1899 and 1901. the Legislature of the state of New York passed a large number of special acts authorizing the municipal authorities of the city of Rochester to assess upon the property of the defendant, in the same manner that assessments were made upon the property of other persons for public improvements, the expense of paving between the tracks, the rails of the tracks, and two feet outside, in <em>different streets </em>which had been paved by the city of Rochester after the month of October, 1893, .in which streets the defendant owned and operated its street surface railroad, and in some of which streets the Rochester City &amp; Brighton Railroad Company k.-id obtained its franchise and constructed its road prior to the 6th day ol May, 1884. That, under and pursuant to such special acts, assessments were made against the property of the defendant in each of said streets for the expense of paving tl\u2019i; space aforesaid in the street. in which such pavement was made, and the defendant commenced an action against the plaintiff, in the Circuit Court of the United States for the then Northern District of New York, for the purpose of vacating and setting aside all of such assessments, upon the ground that the acts of the Legislature of the state of New York under which such .assess<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"94\">*94</page-number>ments were made were, and each of them was, void, and in controversion of the provision of the Constitution of the state of New York and of the Constitution of the United States. That, while all of such actions were pending undetermined, the Legislature of the state of New York, on the 26th day of April, 1901, passed chapter 562, p. 1371, of the Laws of that year, entitled \u201cAn act to authorize and empower the city of Rochester to enter into a contract with the Rochester Railway Company adjusting and settling all differences between the city and the said railway company as to the amount due and owing from the company to the city for certain pavements heretofore made by the city, pursuant to section 98 of the railroad law and providing for the payment of the same.\u201d That such act authorized the plaintiff and defendant to enter into ,a contract for the settlement of all such claims.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"43\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b128-5\">Thereafter, and on the 27th day of April, 1901, plaintiff and the defendant entered into an agreement dated that day, duly executed and acknowledged by the plaintiff by George A.

It was held to be a contract in the case of The People v. Sturtevant, 9 N. Y. 273 [59 Am. Dec. 536], and but a slight examination of its provisions is requisite to show the correctness of that decision. Prior to its acceptance by the defendants, the resolution was only a proposition, having no binding force whatever. It was certainly not then a law, and since that time the common council have taken no action upon it Upon its acceptance (if valid), it became a contract between two parties, binding each to the observance of all its provisions. * * * The defendants counsel insists that the resolution is not a contract, but a license, revocable at the pleasure of the common council.

Village of Skaneateles,. 161 N. Y. 154, 55 N. E. 562, 46 L. R. A. 687, the court had under consideration the effect of certain statutes affecting the rights of the parties. The opinion, at page 166, states: \u201cWe are thus brought to an examination of the statutes, and our first inquiry will be whether they merely threaten parties in the plaintiff\u2019s situation with the consequences of local municipal competition, or constitute an invasion of their grants. The former, as we have seen, Is 'permissible. But the latter may not be done, for the doctrine has been settled since the Dartmouth College Case, 4 Wheat. 518 [4 L. Ed. 629], that a grant of corporate powers by the sovereign to an association of individuals for public use constitutes a contract, within the meaning of the federal Constitution, prohibiting a state legislature from passing laws impairing its obligations. In the recent case of Pearsall v. Great Northern Railroad Company, 161 U. S. 646 [10 Sup. Ct. '705, 40 L. Ed. 838], the court, after a brief review of the Dartmouth College Case, said: \u2018Subsequent, cases have settled the law that, wherever charter rights have been acquired by virtue of the corporate charter, such rights, so far as they are necessary to the full and complete enjoyment of the main object of the grant, are contracts, and beyond the reach of destructive legislation.\u2019 Intermediate the cases cited, there are many cases in the Supreme Court of the United States in which the doctrine referred to has been either asserted or made the basis for the decision, as in New Orleans Gas Co. v. Louisiana Light Co., 115 TJ. S. 650 [6 Sup. Ct. 252, 29 L. Ed. 516]; New Orleans Waterworks Go. v. Rivers, 115 U. S. 674 [6 Sup. Ct. 273, 29 L. Ed. 525]; Louisville Gas Co. v. Citizens\u2019 Gas Co., 115 U. S. 683 [6 Sup. Ct. 265, 29 L. Ed. 510]. These were cases where the grants were of an exclusive right to supply gas or water to a municipality. That court has taken frequent occasion to assert the inviolability of corporate charters in cases respecting the power of taxation, and. in a series of decisions extending over many years, has held that a clause in a contract imposing taxes in lieu of other taxes, or all taxes to which the stockholders would be subject, is impaired by legislation raising the rate of taxation or imposing taxes other than those specified in the charter.\u201d</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"49\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b129-8\">Therefore it must be held here that by the ordinance of January 12, 1869, relieving the Rochester City &amp; Brighton Railroad Company from making any new pavement, approved by the act of the Legislature (Laws 1869, p. 54, c. 34) specifically providing that said railroad company should keep the surface of the streets inside of its tracks in repair, but that, whenever any of said <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"96\">*96</page-number>streets were permanently Improved, said company should not be required to make any part or portion of such improvements, under which ordinance and enactment the railroad company continued to maintain and operate its street surface railroad and extend its railroad in other streets - and parts of streets in the city, a contract was made and entered into by and between the city and the railroad company from the provisions of which neither, without the consent of the other, was at liberty to depart; so that, from the time of the passage of the amended ordinance in 1869 to the time of the enactment of the law of 1884 (Laws of that year, p. 309, c. 252) providing for the construction, extension, maintenance, and operation of street surface railroads, the Rochester City &amp; Brighton Railroad Company was required to keep and maintain the surface of its streets inside the rails of its tracks in good and thorough repair, hut was not required to make or bear the expense of any part or portion of any permanent improvement of the streets in which its tracks had been laid, or any extensions thereof, prior to May 6, 1884, the date of the passage of chapter 252, p. 309, of the Laws of that year.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"50\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b130-5\">The brief of counsel for the city states that the action is brought under the Laws of 1884, \u201cwhich directs that the street railway companies shall, in case of repaving or repairing pavements in the streets of cities, provide at their own expense such repaving or repairs, and in case of neglect the local authorities may themselves perform the work and call upon the railway companies for payment therefor.\u201d That act provides, as stated in the title, for the construction and extension of street surface railroads, and its provisions regulate the manner and terms and conditions upon which corporations may be formed for the purpose of constructing, maintaining, and operating street surface railroads, and for the construction by any existing street surface railroad company of extensions of its lines or branches thereof. \u201cSec. 9. Every such corporation incorporated under, or constructing, extending or operating a railroad constructed or extended under the provisions of this act, within the incorporated cities and villages of this state, shall also whenever and as required under the supervision of the proper local authorities have and keep in permanent repair the portion of every street and avenue between its tracks, the rails of its tracks, and a space two feet in width outside and adjoining the outside rails of its track or tracks so long as it shall continue to use such tracks so constructed under the provisions of this act.\u201d Laws 1884, p. 313, c. 252. This provision applies, as it clearly appears from the context of the section, and also from the various provisions of the other sections of the act, to the tracks of street surface railroad companies incorporated under its provisions, and to the tracks only of an extension of the lines or branches of the railroad of an existing street surface railroad company. That the act was not intended to regulate the operation of the railroad of an existing street surface railroad company is expressly shown in \"the section providing for the regulation of fares, as follows: \u201cSec. 13. No company or corporation incorIiorated under, or constructing and operating a railroad under the provisions of this act, shall charge any passenger more than five cents for one continuous ride from any point on its road or on any road or branch operated by it or under its control, to any point thereon or on any connecting branch thereof within the limits of any incorporated city or village. This section shall not be construed to apply to any part of any road heretofore constructed and now in operation unless such company shall acquire the right to extend such road, or to construct branches thereof under the provisions of this act, in which event its rate of fare shall not exceed its authorized rates prior to such extension.\u201d If, however, the provision of the act can be regarded as broad enough to apply the provisions of section 9 to the entire railroad of any existing street surface railroad company extending its lines under the provisions of the act, then such provisions are unconstitutional, as being violative of the existing contract between the city and the Rochester City &amp; Brighton Railroad Company, to all the rights of which company the defendant has succeeded.

It may be said that such assent of the city to the location of the defendant\u2019s tracks as the same had been laid under approval and consents'obtained from time to time was a mere formality; no new or additional franchise being granted by such ratification and approval, the conditions imposed were violative of the previously existing contracts. But the resolution of the common council that the provisions of article 4 of the railway law should be complied with, assented to by the defendant, is modified, and the rights of the parties specifically stated and determined, by the subsequent provision that all of the provisions of any agreement between the city of Rochester and any street railroad company, and all ordinances, resolutions, grants, and consents heretofore passed by said city with reference to the construction, maintenance, or operation of street railroads within said city, shall remain in full and binding force; and these resolutions shall not be construed as repealing, modifying, or changing in any respect the provisions or terms of any agreement previously entered into between said city and any street railroad company. Moreover, further exactions were made by the city in requiring the defendant, as long, as its successors and assigns should operate, maintain, and use its railroad in said city, to furnish free transportation on its cars to the police and firemen of the city, for which there was no equivalent except the resolution of the common council ratifying and approving the location of the railroad and tracks of the defendant as the same were then operated and used.</summary>\n<summary data-order=\"52\" data-type=\"summary\" id=\"b131-4\">It is argued on behalf of the city that the special acts of the Legislature authorizing the municipal authorities of the city to assess upon the property of the railroad company, in the same manner that assessments are made upon the property of other owners benefited by the improvement of the streets, the expense of paving between and outside the railroad tracks, is not violative of the rights of the defendant, as impairing the obligations of its contract with the city; citing Lake St. R.
