The complaint alleges, and evidence was given tending to prove, that the defendant had agreed to repair the ceiling, and that the injury resulted from his breach of that contract. The obligation being wholly contractual, no action in tort will lie for a violation of the agreement. Schick v. Fleischhauer, 26 App. Div. 210, 49 N. Y. Supp. 962; Frank v. Mandel, 76 App. Div. 413, 78 N. Y. Supp. 855; Goldberg v. Besdine, 76 App. Div. 451, 78 N. Y. Supp. 776; Goluback v. Almodo, 79 App. Div. 636, 80 N. Y. Supp. 1136; Stelz v. Van Dusen, 93 App. Div. 358, 87 N. Y. Supp. 716. The general rule is that an action for negligence can only be maintained when the violated duty is one which is imposed by law.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-17\">The learned counsel for the appellant concede in their brief that no liability in tort attaches to the defendant for his failure to fulfill the covenant, but contend that he was liable on the theory that the injury resulted from a defective condition in the roof of the building, which was under his control, and of which defective condition he had ample notice. Assuming that the defendant was obliged by law to keep the roof in repair, it is a sufficient answer to the appellant\u2019s contention that there was no evidence given establishing either that the fall of the appellant\u2019s ceiling resulted from a defective condition in the roof of the building, or that the defendant had notice of such defective condition. Moreover, the claim now insisted on was not presented at the trial, and the general rule is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>that a party must be held on appeal to the theory of the trial.
