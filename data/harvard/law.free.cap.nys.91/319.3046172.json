In this case the agent was supported by the janitor of the period involved. Two elevator boys of the same period testified, however, that they never had heard of such a rule, excepting as to the plaintiff\u2019s servant, whom and whom alone they had been instructed to exclude. The plausibility and probability of the testimony given by the plaintiff\u2019s witnesses are obvious enough. Nevertheless the jury, if content to take the testimony of the discharged elevator boys, might find under the charge, to which no exception was taken, that the defendant was evicted by the sudden and arbitrary restriction of the use of the device apparently offered him, on his hiring, as an appurtenant convenience incident to the premises demised him.
