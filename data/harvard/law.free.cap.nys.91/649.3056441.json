On the 16th day of February, 1904, there was filed and recorded in the office of the Secretary of State a certificate of incorporation of the Columbian Chemical Company. The object of such corporation is to purchase and sell drugs, chemicals, and chemical compounds of every name, nature, and description; to mix, compound, and prepare the same into medicines, remedies, and other forms for use and sale, and for other things. On the 25th day of February, 1904, the Columbia Chemical Company wrote to the Secretary of State, in which letter it states that it is informed that a certificate of incorporation has been granted to the Columbian Chemical Company to deal in chemicals; and it further says: \u201cIs not this title so similar to that of the Columbia Chemical Co. as to bring it under the statute prohibiting the granting of such certificate. Awaiting your advice on this, we remain.\u201d On the 26th day of February, 1904, the Secretary of State replied to said letter, in which letter he acknowledged the receipt of the letter of February 25th, and further says: \u201cWe do not think the corporate title is so similar to that of your company as to bring it within the prohibition of section 6 of the general corporation law.\u201d</headnotes>\n<disposition data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"disposition\" id=\"Ab9\">Writ quashed.</disposition>\n<p data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"judges\" id=\"b684-7\">Argued before PARKER, P.

General Corporation Law, \u00a7 6 (chapter 687, p. 1802, Laws 1892, as last amended by chapter 9, p. 12, Laws 1902). The filing of the proposed certificate of incorporation is to effect an incorporation. General Corporation Law, \u00a7 6, .supra. It is upon making, signing, acknowledging, and filing the certificate that a proposed corporation becomes a corporation. Business Corporations Law, \u00a7 2 (chapter 691, p. 2042, Laws 1892, as last amended by chapter 525, p. 1193, Laws 1903, and chapter 446, p. 1072, Laws 1904). Assuming that the certificate of incorporation of said the Columbian Chemical Company was filed in the proper county clerk\u2019s office on the same day that it was filed in the Secretary of State\u2019s office, said the Columbian Chemical Company has been an incorporated company since February 16, 1904. If we now cancel and revoke the filing and record of the certificate effecting its incorporation, we may complicate business transactions affecting not only the incorporators and stockholders, but also those who have done business with the corporation. In a case where the Secretary of State improperly determines that the name of a proposed corporation as stated in a certificate of incorporation presented to him for filing and record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"651\">*651</page-number>is the same as the name of an existing domestic corporation, or that it so nearly resembles such name as to be calculated to deceive, and he refuses to file and record such proposed certificate, there may be no adequate remedy to the persons or corporations claiming to be aggrieved other than by a review of such determination by a writ of certiorari. In such case relief could be granted without complicating private interests. The remedy by certiorari is seldom, if ever, allowed where there is any other adequate remedy. Ency.

Where a certificate is filed with the same name as that of an existing corporation, or where the name so nearly resembles that of the existing corporation as to be calculated to deceive, the action of the Secretary of State is not conclusive, and the courts have frequently, by a judgment in equity, granted relief to a prior corporation aggrieved.
