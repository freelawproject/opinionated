T. Oppenheim &amp; Co., thereby inducing the plaintiff to pay him $50 upon a check drawn upon that firm, the justice dismissed the complaint on the ground that the instrument was not a check, but a draft. In form the paper was a \u201ccheck,\u201d as the word is customarily employed, and, until the distinction was suggested by the justice, it was considered a check by all the persons concerned. Moreover, as far as this action was to be affected, in substance it was a check, as defined by statute, being drawn upon an association of individuals engaged in th\u00e9 business of banking. Neg. Inst. Law, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 321; Laws 1897, pp. 720, 756, c. 612. To require the plaintiff to sustain the affirmative upon a wholly collateral matter, and to show that this firm made reports to the banking department, where the exact legal definition of the character of this pacer as a \"check\u201d or \u201cdraft\u201d was entirely immaterial to the only issues the parties had come to try, would not seem to be a commendable method of procedure to the end that justice might be readily administered. .</p>\n<p id=\"b111-16\">Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered, with costs to the appellant to abide the event. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
