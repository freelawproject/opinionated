Y. 112, 71 N. E. 748; 89 App. Div. 368, 85 N. Y. Supp. 928. We affirmed without opinion on the first argument. It was supposed that the rule the Court of Appeals laid down in Matter of Tot-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"909\">*909</page-number>ten, supra, might affect the questions in this case. In my opinion, it did not. In that case (page 125, 179 N. Y., page 752, 71 N. E.) the court says:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b943-3\">\u201cAfter much reflection upon the subject, guided by the principles established by our former decisions, we announce the following as our conclusion: A deposit by one person of his own money in his own name as trustee for another, standing alone, does not establish an irrevocable trust during the lifetime of the depositor. It is a tentative trust, merely, revocable at will until the depositor dies or completes the gift in his lifetime by some unequivocal act or declaration, such as delivery of the passbook or notice to the beneficiary. In case the depositor dies before the beneficiary without revocation, or some decisive act or declaration of disaffirmance, the presumption arises that an absolute trust was created as to the balance on hand at the death of the depositor.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">The point in the case at bar is that the deposit by the deceased, Mrs. Coote, of the moneys in the defendant savings bank, did not \u201cstand alone.\u201d The court has found, on evidence which, though slight, is sufficient, that, \u201cbefore opening such account and making such deposit, said Ann Coote declared it to be her intention that the account and money should be for the benefit of Margaret Brown.\u201d The appellant\u2019s contention that the purpose of the depositor must be clear and unequivocal is the law; but Mrs. Coote\u2019s statement that she wanted Margaret Brown to have the money, and did not want her husband (Coote) to get it, does not leave much room for doubt as to her meaning, especially when accompanied with the deposit, \u201cIn trust for Margaret Brown.\u201d Her intention, expressed without equivocation, coupled with the deposit in the form in which it appears, created an irrevocable trust, and I advise affirmance, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
