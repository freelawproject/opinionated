The jury found for the defendant, and the plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-16\">The evidence was conflicting, and there is ample to support the verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-17\">While we think the verdict should not be disturbed, we feel called upon to discuss one question presented by the appeal. The defendant offered in evidence, under plaintiff\u2019s objection and exception, a copy of the ordinance of the \u201cRight of Way,\u201d art. 1, \u00a7 1, adopted by the board of aldermen of the chy of New York August 31, 1897, and approved by the mayor September <em>2, </em>1897. In stating the law applicable to the case, the learned trial justice said to the jury, in the course of his charge:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-18\">\u201cThe claim here is that this occurred at the street crossing of Fifty-Eighth street, and Madison avenue. The law, as I understand it, and so charge you. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>is, at street crossings the right of operators of street railways and the rights of drivers of vehicles are equal and reciprocal; one has no greater right than the other. Another proposition that should assist you in determining the questions presented to you, when you reach it, is this: By an ordinance in force at the time of the accident, article 1, determining the right of way under section -1, passed by our authorities, the common council, reads: \u2018That on all public streets or highways of the city all vehicles going in a northerly or southerly direction shall have the right of way over any vehicle going easterly or westerly.\u2019 Bearing the two legal propositions in mind, the one about equal rights and the other about the right of way, I will ask you to apply this test in order to determine whether the plaintiff\u2019s driver in any manner contributed to the accident or injury, or whether the defendant\u2019s servant, the motorman, was negligent.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">At the close of the charge in chief, defendant\u2019s counsel asked the court to charge \u201cthat tire defendant\u2019s car had the right of way at that point,\u201d and the reply was, \u201cI decline to charge other than I have already charged.\u201d And again, in response to a request of defendant\u2019s counsel, the court declined to charge that the ordinance of the common council was controlling at the place of the accident. In this connection we must direct attention to the case of Cushing v. Met. St. Ry. Co., 92 App. Div. 510, 87 N. Y. Supp. 314, where the rule applicable in an accident case, consisting of a collision between two vehicles at a crossing in this city, and the ordinance above mentioned has been received in evidence, is correctly stated. This case holds that, under the circumstances detailed, the rights of the parties are not equal, and that the instruction to the j'ury should be that the vehicle going northerly or southerly has the right of way over any vehicle going in an easterly or westerly' direction. When the ordinance under consideration becomes evidence in a case, its consideration must.not be taken from a jury. We reach- the conclusion that the charge was more fair to the plaintiff than he was entitled to have, that no errors were committed upon the' trial prejudicial to the plaintiff, and that the judgment, is right and should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">Judgment affirmed, with costs to the respondent. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
