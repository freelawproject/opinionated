J.</author>\n<p id=\"A2_K\">The plaintiff was seriously injured on December 17, 1902, while riding on one of the defendant\u2019s horse cars on Avenue A, in the vicinity of Second street, in the borough of Manhattan. He was a conductor in the defendant\u2019s employ, but had been laid off a few days before because of illne\u00e1s, but had received on the day of the accident a physician\u2019s certificate, required by the defendant\u2019s rules, attesting that he would be able to resume his duties on December' 18th. He boarded one of the defendant\u2019s cars on the day of the accident, and was allowed to ride free because he was wearing the uniform of a conductor, and was regarded as being in the defendant\u2019s employment. The conductor of the car required him to ride on the front platform, and while he was there the driver suddenly loosened the brake, and the resulting movement of the car threw him off and inflicted the very serious injury of which he complains. The complaint is framed under the act commonly known as the \u201cEmployers\u2019 Liability Act\u201d (chapter 600, p. 1748, of the Laws of 1902), and proof was given of the service of the notice required by section 2 of that statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b918-12\">Conceding that the plaintiff was free from negligence which contributed to his accident, and that the act of the driver in suddenly releasing the brake constituted negligence, I am of opinion that the plaintiff cannot maintain this action, because the negligence was that of a co-employ\u00e9. The plaintiff must be regarded as in-the defendant\u2019s service, under the circumstances of the case, notwithstanding the fact that he was temporarily relieved from active duty by reason of his sickness. He understood that he was traveling free because of his uniform and because of his employment. ' He testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b918-13\">\u201cOn the strength of my uniform and the badge I had on, I had not paid any fare when I went into the car. I intended to take a seat when\u2014 I had not paid any fare at this time. I got on at Eourteenth street, and stood on the front platform, and paid no fare. The reason I did that was because I had my badge on, and uniform.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b918-14\">That an employ\u00e9 of a common carrier, riding free because of his employment, cannot recover for injuries sustained by reason of the negligence of a fellow servant, is settled law in this state. Ross v. N. Y. Cent. &amp; Hudson R. R. Co., 5 Hun, 488, affirmed 74 N. Y. 617; Vick v. N. Y. C. &amp; H. R. R. Co., 95 N. Y. 267, 47 Am. Rep. 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number>The provisions o\u00ed the employers\u2019 liability act, supra, extend the liability of the employer to a case in which the injury results from the negligence of a co-employ\u00e9 only where the negligent person is \u201cin the service of the employer entrusted with and exercising superintendence whose sole or principal duty is that of superintendence, or in the absence of such superintendent, of any person acting as superintendent with the authority or consent of sufch employer.\u201d The learned counsel for the appellant insists that the duties of a conductor embrace superintendence, and that it was negligence on the part of the conductor having charge of the car to compel the plaintiff to occupy a dangerous position upon the front platform. It is true that, in a general sense, the duties both of a car conductor and of a car driver require the exercise of superintendence to the extent that intelligent watchfulness is essential to the careful performance of their work; but the superintendence referred to in the statute is something more than this, and is intended to relate to that class of servants who are generally known as \u201csuperintendents,\u201d and whose sole or principal duty is to oversee the work of others.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-5\">The technical point is made on the appellant\u2019s behalf that his testimony was to the effect that in December, 1903, he was employed by the Metropolitan Street Railway Company, and that there is no evidence that that company and the defendant are identical. This point is. destroyed by the notice of the accident, hereinbefore referred to, signed and served by the plaintiff, which is addressed to the defendant, the Interurban Street Railway Company, in which the plaintiff states (referring to the date of the accident) \u201cthat at that time I was on your employment list of conductors.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b919-6\">The judgment should be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b919-7\">Judgment affirmed, with costs. All concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
