Qualls, an inmate at Ross Correctional Institute, filed a complaint in the Court of Appeals for Meigs County. Qualls sought a writ of mandamus to compel appellee, Meigs County Prosecuting Attorney Pat Story, to turn over certain transcripts, statements, and police reports from Qualls\u2019s criminal case to him. Qualls claimed entitlement to these records under Crim.R. 16. Although Qualls filed two affidavits of indigency and a motion to waive docket fees and security deposit with his complaint, he did not file the statement required by R.C. 2969.25(C)(1) setting forth the balance in his inmate account \u201cfor each of the preceding six months, as certified by the institutional cashier.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b421-12\">{\u00b6 2} On July 26, 2004, the court of appeals sua sponte dismissed Qualls\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b421-13\">{\u00b6 3} We affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.
