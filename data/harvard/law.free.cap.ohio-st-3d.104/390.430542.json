For the following reasons, we conclude that the appointment of a legal guardian for a person within the age of minority or of unsound mind does not remove the disabilities referred to in R.C. 2305.16 and, therefore, does not commence the running of the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-14\">{\u00b6 2} On December 29, 1997, Morgan Weaver (\u201cMorgan\u201d) then age 17, was struck by a car while riding his bicycle and suffered a traumatic brain injury, necessitating his constant care. Two subsequent incidents are the subjects of complaints involved in this case: on May 7, 1998, while a patient at Edwin Shaw Hospital, he allegedly fell out of a wheelchair, resulting in injuries to his head and face, and on June 29, 1998, while a patient at HealthSouth of Erie Rehabilitation Hospital, he again allegedly fell out of another wheelchair, resulting in injuries to his head and teeth.</p>\n<p id=\"b469-15\">{\u00b6 3} Following these incidents, on January 4, 1999, the Tuscarawas County Probate Court adjudicated him incompetent and appointed his parents, Edward and Deborah Weaver (\u201cthe Weavers\u201d), as his legal guardians. On March 10, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>2000, his parents filed medical-negligence claims against both Edwin Shaw Hospital and HealthSouth (\u201cthe hospitals\u201d) for the injuries sustained in the separate wheelchair incidents.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-5\">{\u00b6 4} The hospitals moved for summary judgment, arguing that the one-year statute of limitations had expired on both claims. The Weavers objected, arguing inter alia that R.C. 2305.16 tolled the running of the statute of limitations for a person of \u201cunsound mind.\u201d The hospitals acknowledged the applicability of R.C. 2305.16 but asserted that Morgan\u2019s disability had been removed by the appointment of his parents as his guardians \u2014 more than a year before the filing of the lawsuit.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-7\">{\u00b6 5} The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the hospitals and held that the appointment of his parents as his legal guardians triggered the running of the statute of limitations. On appeal, the court of appeals reversed in a cogent and well-reasoned opinion and held, for a variety of reasons, that the appointment of a guardian does not commence the running of the statute of limitations. It then certified its judgment as being in conflict with the Sixth District Court of Appeals\u2019 judgment in <em>McManus v. Belcher </em>(Jan. 13, 1995), Lucas App. No. L-94-032, 1995 WL 12145, reversed in part on other grounds (1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 106, 652 N.E.2d 684.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-8\">{\u00b6 6} We accepted the case for discretionary review (case No. 2003-1055), determined that a conflict exists (case No. 2003-1145), and consolidated these matters for review; we are called upon to consider whether the appointment of a guardian for an individual who is of unsound mind removes that disability as referred to in the saving statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-9\">{\u00b6 7} R.C. 2305.16 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b470-10\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cUnless otherwise provided in sections 1302.98, 1304.35, and 2305.04 to 2305.14 of the Revised Code, if a person entitled to bring any action mentioned in those sections, unless for penalty or forfeiture, is, at the time the cause of action accrues, within the age of minority or of unsound mind, the person may bring it within the respective times limited by those sections, after the disability is removed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b470-11\">{\u00b6 9} The parties here agree on three matters: (1) the tolling provision of R.C. 2305.16 applies in this case, (2) Morgan was of unsound mind at the time his causes of action accrued, and (3) Morgan is still of unsound mind. The dispute concerns whether the word \u201cdisability,\u201d as it is used in R.C. 2305.16, refers to Morgan\u2019s condition or his capacity to commence a legal action.</p>\n<p id=\"b470-13\">{\u00b6 10} The Weavers urge that \u201cdisability\u201d refers to the status of the person entitled to bring an action. Therefore, they argue, because R.C. 2305.16 tolls the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>statute until \u201cthe disability is removed,\u201d Morgan\u2019s claims are not subject to the statute of limitations until he becomes of sound mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-4\">{\u00b6 11} The hospitals, on the other hand, argue that \u201cdisability\u201d refers to the person\u2019s lack of capacity to commence a legal proceeding; accordingly, they argue that the appointment of a legal guardian removed Morgan\u2019s \u201cdisability\u201d and commenced the running of the statute of limitations.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-5\">I. Statutory Construction</p>\n<p id=\"b471-6\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cIn the construction of statutes the purpose in every instance is to ascertain and give effect to the legislative intent, and it is well settled that none of the language employed therein should be disregarded, and that all of the terms used should be given their usual and ordinary meaning and signification except where the lawmaking body has indicated that the language is not so used.\u201d <em>Carter v. Youngstown Div. of Water </em>(1946), 146 Ohio St. 203, 32 O.O. 184, 65 N.E.2d 63, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-7\">{\u00b6 13} Further, this court \u201cmust look to the statute itself to determine legislative intent, and if such intent is clearly expressed therein, the statute may not be restricted, constricted, qualified, narrowed, enlarged or abridged; significance and effect should, if possible, be accorded to every word, phrase, sentence and part of an act, and in the absence of any definition of the intended meaning of words or terms used in a legislative enactment, they will, in the interpretation of the act, be given their common, ordinary and accepted meaning in the connection in which they are used.\u201d <em>Wachendorf v. Shaver </em>(1948), 149 Ohio St. 231, 36 O.O. 554, 78 N.E.2d 370, paragraph five of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-8\">{\u00b6 14} We must also keep in mind the general rule regarding statutes of limitation: \u201cin the absence of a saving clause, the statute runs against all persons, whether under disability, or not.\u201d <em>Powell v. Koehler </em>(1894), 52 Ohio St. 103, 118, 39 N.E. 195. And, \u201cexceptions in statutes of limitations in favor of persons under disability should be strictly construed, and never extended beyond their plain import.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-9\">{\u00b6 15} The plain import of R.C. 2305.16 tolls the running of the statute of limitations while the claimant is \u201cwithin the age of minority or of unsound mind\u201d at the time the cause of action accrues. The tolling ends, however, when the disability is removed. The statute contains no other exceptions.</p>\n<p id=\"b471-10\">{\u00b6 16} Further, only two descriptions of the term \u201cdisability\u201d are referred to in the statute \u2014 the claimant\u2019s being \u201cwithin the age of minority or of unsound mind.\u201d Notably, the statute provides that such claimants may bring an action within the respective times of the applicable statutes of limitation after \u201cthe disability is removed,\u201d not after appointment of a legal guardian. Had the General Assembly intended to include such a provision, it could have done so. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"394\">*394</page-number>This court is not inclined to alter the language of an unambiguous statute. <em>Wachendorf, </em>149 Ohio St. 231, 36 O.O. 554, 78 N.E.2d 370, paragraph five of the syllabus. Further, see <em>O\u2019Brien v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth. </em>(1989), 405 Mass. 439, 443, 541 N.E.2d 334, in which the court interpreted a similar tolling statute and concluded \u201cthat the appointment of a guardian has no effect on the protections afforded by the disability tolling statute. Our conclusion is based primarily on the fact that the statute does not mention the effect of a guardian\u2019s appointment\u201d.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-5\">{\u00b6 17} In our interpretation of this statute, we give the term \u201cdisability\u201d its \u201ccommon, ordinary and accepted meaning in the connection in which [it is] used,\u201d <em>Waehendorf, </em>and in so doing, we have concluded that the term \u201cdisability,\u201d as used in R.C. 2305.16, refers only to the two descriptions contained in that statute \u2014 being within the age of minority or of unsound mind.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-6\">{\u00b6 18} The second paragraph of R.C. 2305.16 also supports our conclusion that a \u201cdisability is removed\u201d only when the person reaches the age of majority or becomes of sound mind:</p>\n<p id=\"b472-7\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cAfter the cause of action accrues, if the person entitled to bring the action becomes of unsound mind and is adjudicated as such by a court of competent jurisdiction or is confined in an institution or hospital under a diagnosed condition or disease which renders the person of unsound mind, <em>the time during which the person is of unsound mind </em>and so adjudicated or so confined <em>shall not be computed </em>as any part of the period within which the action must be brought.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b472-8\">{\u00b6 20} Importantly, this paragraph provides that the tolling continues during the time the claimant remains \u201cof unsound mind\u201d but, notably, does not mention the appointment of a guardian. As the court of appeals observed, the maxim \u201cexpressio unius est exclusio alterius\u201d also prevents our addition of an additional statutory exclusion not expressly incorporated into this statute by the legislature.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-9\">II. Relevant Case Authority</p>\n<p id=\"AuG\">A. Ward Owns the Cause of Action</p>\n<p id=\"b472-10\">{\u00b6 21} The hospitals argue that even if \u201cdisability\u201d as used in R.C. 2305.16 refers to incompetency, the statute of limitations should begin to run upon the appointment of a legal guardian because, at that point, legal redress becomes available to the claimant.</p>\n<p id=\"b472-11\">{\u00b6 22} This argument is unpersuasive because the cause of action belongs to the ward, not to the guardian; hence, the tolling provided by R.C. 2305.16 applies as long as the ward suffers from the disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"395\">*395</page-number>{\u00b6 23} Several other jurisdictions have considered and rejected similar arguments. In <em>McCarthy v. Volkswagen of Am., Inc., </em>the New York Court of Appeals stated, \u201c[T]he Legislature meant to extend the toll for insanity to only those individuals who are unable to protect their legal rights <em>because of an over-all inability to function in society.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) (1982), 55 N.Y.2d 543, 548, 450 N.Y.S.2d 457, 435 N.E.2d 1072 (refusing to extend the meaning of \u201cinsanity\u201d in the state\u2019s tolling statute to include persons with posttraumatic neurosis). The Nebraska Supreme Court reached a similar conclusion: \u201cInsanity within [Neb. Rev.Stat.] \u00a7 25-213 [Nebraska\u2019s tolling statute] results in an incapacity which disqualifies one from acting for the protection of one\u2019s rights.\u201d <em>Sacchi v. Blodig </em>(1983), 215 Neb. 817, 822, 341 N.W.2d 326.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-5\">{\u00b6 24} Further, the Supreme Court of Washington held that its statute \u201ctolls the statute of limitations for a legally incompetent person notwithstanding the appointment of a guardian. This is so because the right to the tolling statute vests in the incompetent person not in the guardian. From this premise, it follows that the guardian\u2019s subsequent actions on the incompetent person\u2019s behalf should have no additional effect upon the statute of limitations unless they result in res judicata.\u201d <em>Young v. Key Pharmaceuticals, Inc. </em>(1989), 112 Wash.2d 216, 223, 770 P.2d 182. The court also concluded that the phrase \u201ca person entitled to bring an action,\u201d contained in its statute, referred to the claimant and not to the guardian. Id., 112 Wash.2d 216, 222, 770 P.2d 182. See, also, <em>Pardy v. United States </em>(S.D.Ill.1982), 548 F.Supp. 682, 684 (noting that Illinois courts have held that the appointment of a guardian does not affect the tolling provision with regard to a minor because \u201cthe minor is the true owner of the action\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b473-6\">{\u00b6 25} We agree with this reasoning and conclude that the term \u201cdisability\u201d as used in R.C. 2305.16 does not refer to the legal inability to commence suit; rather, it refers only to the two descriptions of minority and unsound mind contained therein. This is because there is no language in this statute from which we could conclude that the legislature intended that a cause of action would accrue when a legal guardian discovered the ward\u2019s injury and its cause.</p>\n<p id=\"b473-7\">B. Ohio Authority</p>\n<p id=\"b473-8\">{\u00b6 26} The hospitals also cite <em>McManus v. Belcher, </em>Lucas App. No. L-94-032, 1995 WL 12145, the conflict case certified to us by the Fifth District Court of Appeals, in which McManus, as guardian for a brain-damaged ward, Charles Smith, filed claims against Smith\u2019s alleged tortfeasors. The trial court granted summary judgment for the tortfeasors, holding that the claims had been filed subsequent to the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations. The appellate court in that case agreed, holding that the appointment of a guardian on May 16, 1990, had triggered the running of the statute of limitations and that, therefore, the claims, which had been filed on April 20, 1993, were barred by the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"396\">*396</page-number>statute of limitations. The court ruled that \u201cthe statute of limitations for personal injury is not tolled for an incompetent individual once a guardian has been appointed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b474-4\">{\u00b6 27} <em>McManus </em>is the only Ohio case that has reached this conclusion. Although <em>McManus </em>cites <em>Maylin v. Cleveland Psychiatric Inst. </em>(1988), 52 Ohio App.3d 106, 557 N.E.2d 170, to support its decision, the court in <em>Maylin </em>expressly \u201cdecline[d] to decide whether R.C. 2305.16 would apply to a guardian of the estate bringing a cause of action on behalf of his ward, or whether R.C. 2305.16 would apply to a guardian of the person bringing a cause of action on the ward\u2019s behalf with the approval of the probate court.\u201d <em>Maylin, </em>52 Ohio App.3d at 109, 557 N.E.2d 170. In fact, the Tenth District acknowledged that the ward in that case could \u201cbring this cause of action * * * herself when she is restored to competency.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-5\">C. Other States</p>\n<p id=\"b474-6\">{\u00b6 28} We recognize that some courts have interpreted saving statutes as holding that the appointment of a guardian triggers the running of the statute of limitations. The hospitals claim in their brief that seven jurisdictions have so determined. For example, in <em>First-Citizens Bank &amp; Trust Co. v. Willis </em>(1962), 257 N.C. 59, 63, 125 S.E.2d 359, the court concluded that, although \u201cthe personal disability of insanity remained with the widow * * * when the guardian was appointed for her on 9 December, 1953, the disability to dissent [from her late husband\u2019s will] was removed.\u201d And, therefore, \u201cthe statute began to run against her right to dissent from that date and she is now barred. To hold otherwise would frequently preclude the settlement of estates during the lifetime of an insane spouse.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-7\">{\u00b6 29} Similarly, in <em>Zator v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>(1988), 69 Haw. 594, 752 P.2d 1073, the Hawaii Supreme Court decided that the appointment of a guardian commenced the running of the statute of limitations because the guardian could prosecute the incompetent\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b474-8\">{\u00b6 30} The overwhelming majority of courts, however, that have interpreted statutes similar to Ohio\u2019s have concluded that the appointment of a guardian has no effect on the tolling of the statute of limitations. See, e.g., <em>Mason v. Ford Motor Co. </em>(C.A.8, 1985), 755 F.2d 120 (assuming that Missouri would apply the general rule that the appointment of a guardian has no effect on tolling); <em>Wayne Cty. Regional Educational Serv. Agency v. Pappas </em>(E.D.Mich.1999), 56 F.Supp.2d 807, 815 (\u201cUnder Michigan law, it is well-settled that an individual with a mental disability is the beneficiary of the tolling statute even where his rights have been capably handled by a guardian or an attorney\u201d); <em>Desert State Life Mgt. Services v. Assn. of Retarded Citizens of Albuquerque </em>(D.N.M.1996), 939 F.Supp. 835; <em>Smith v. Reno </em>(D.Nev.1984), 580 F.Supp. 591; <em>Henry v. New York </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"397\">*397</page-number>(1999), 94 N.Y.2d 275, 702 N.Y.S.2d 580, 724 N.E.2d 372 (explaining that New York\u2019s CPLR, Section 208, which tolls a statute of limitations during period when person is \u201cunder a disability because of infancy,\u201d is not terminated by acts of guardian or legal representative in taking steps to pursue claims on infant\u2019s behalf); <em>Emerson v. S. Ry. Co. </em>(Ala.1981), 404 So.2d 576, 579 (the appointment of a guardian for a mentally incompetent or nonage person does not have the effect of commencing the running of the period of limitations tolled by virtue of the disability); <em>Mason v. Sorrell </em>(1976), 260 Ark. 27, 551 S.W.2d 184; <em>First State Bank v. Catron </em>(1937), 268 Ky. 513, 105 S.W.2d 162; <em>Keating v. Michigan Cent. RR. Co. </em>(1892), 94 Mich. 219, 221, 53 N.W. 1053 (\u201cthe disability mentioned in the statute can have no other meaning than the infancy of the party, and it is not removed until the full period of his nonage shall elapse\u201d); <em>Kiley v. Jennings, Strouss &amp; Salmon </em>(Ariz.App.1996), 187 Ariz. 136, 927 P.2d 796 (the appointment of a conservator will not cease the tolling of the statute of limitations for those of unsound mind); <em>Gottesman v. Simon </em>(1959), 169 Cal.App.2d 494, 337 P.2d 906.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-5\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-6\">{\u00b6 31} Whether or not the appointment of a guardian for those within the age of minority or of unsound mind in Ohio <em>should </em>commence the running of a statute of limitations is a policy consideration best left to the Ohio General Assembly., Other state legislatures have so provided.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-7\">{\u00b6 32} In Colorado, for example, disability is defined as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b475-8\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cAs used in [Article 81: Limitations \u2014 Persons under Disability], unless the context otherwise requires:</p>\n<p id=\"b475-9\">{\u00b6 34} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b475-10\">{\u00b6 35} \u201c(3) \u2018Person under disability\u2019 means any person who is a minor under eighteen years of age, a mental incompetent, or a person under other legal disability <em>and who does not have a legal guardian.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Colo. Rev.Stat. 13-81-101.</p>\n<p id=\"b475-11\">{\u00b6 36} The Colorado law then expressly provides for the statute of limitations to run after a guardian is appointed:</p>\n<p id=\"b475-12\">{\u00b6 37} \u201cIf such person under disability is represented by a legal representative at the time the right accrues, or if a legal representative is appointed for such person under disability at any time after the right accrues and prior to the termination of such disability, the applicable statute of limitations shall run against such person under disability in the same manner, for the same period, and with the same effect as it runs against persons not under disability.\u201d Colo.Rev.Stat. 13-81-103(l)(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b475-13\">{\u00b6 38} And New York has imposed a time limit on filing claims regardless of disability:</p>\n<p id=\"b476-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"398\">*398</page-number>{\u00b6 39} \u201cIf a person entitled to commence an action is under a disability because of infancy or insanity at the time the cause of action accrues, and the time otherwise limited for commencing the action is three years or more and expires no later than three years after the disability ceases, or the person under the disability dies, the time within which the action must be commenced shall be extended to three years after the disability ceases or the person under the disability dies, whichever event first occurs; if the time otherwise limited is less than three years, the time shall be extended by the period of disability. <em>The time within which the action must be commenced shall not be extended by this provision beyond ten years after the cause of action accrues, except, in any action other than for medical, dental or podiatric malpractice, where the person was under a disability due to infancy.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) CPLR Section 208.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-4\">{\u00b6 40} Further, the Mississippi saving statute is also limited:</p>\n<p id=\"b476-5\">{\u00b6 41} \u201cIf any person entitled to bring any of the personal actions mentioned shall, at the time at which the cause of action accrued, be under the disability of infancy or unsoundness of mind, he may bring the actions within the times in this chapter respectively limited, after his disability shall be removed as provided by law. However, the saving in favor of persons <em>under disability of unsoundness of mind </em>shall never extend longer than twenty-one (21) years.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Miss.Code Ann. Section 15-1-59.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-6\">{\u00b6 42} New Jersey\u2019s saving clause provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b476-7\">{\u00b6 43} \u201cIf any person entitled to any of the actions or proceedings specified in N.J.S.2A:14-1 to 2A:14-8 or N.J.S.2A:14-16 to 2A:14-20 or to a right or title of entry under N.J.S.2A:14-6 is or shall be, at the time of any such cause of action or right or title accruing, under the age of 21 years, or insane, such person may commence such action or make such entry, within such time as limited by those statutes, <em>after his coming to or being of full age or of sane mind.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) N.J.Stat.Ann. Section 2A:14-21.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-8\">{\u00b6 44} We recognize that Ohio\u2019s General Assembly has placed an additional limit on filing claims for malpractice. Pursuant to R.C. 2305.113(C)(1), no medical-malpractice action may be commenced \u201cmore than four years after the occurrence of the act or omission constituting the alleged basis\u201d of the claim. Notably, this provision does not apply \u201cto persons within the age of minority or of unsound mind as provided by section 2305.16 of the Revised Code.\u201d As other state legislatures have done, Ohio\u2019s General Assembly could have provided that a disability is removed upon the appointment of a guardian, but to date it has not chosen to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b476-9\">{\u00b6 45} In the absence of such a statutory direction, we conclude that the term \u201cdisability\u201d as used in R.C. 2305.16 refers only to the two descriptions contained in that statute \u2014 being within the age of minority or being of unsound mind. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"399\">*399</page-number>appointment of a guardian for a person within the age of minority or for a person of unsound mind neither removes the disability referred to in R.C. 2305.16 nor commences the running of the statute of limitations. In this case, the parties agree that Morgan is still of unsound mind; hence, his disability has not been removed. Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Asks\">Burns, White &amp; Hickton, L.L.C., and Michael G.
