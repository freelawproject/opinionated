Blaszak of Westlake, Ohio, Attorney Registration No. 0018800, was admitted to the practice of law in Ohio in 1970. On June 4, 2002, we suspended respondent\u2019s license to practice pursuant to Gov.Bar R. V(5)(A)(3) (interim suspension upon notice of felony conviction) because he had been convicted of violating Section 201(c)(3), Title 18, U.S.Code, which prohibits the sale of witness testimony in a pending case. <em>In re Blaszak, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 1478, 2002-Ohio-2496, 769 N.E.2d 395. See, also, <em>United States v. Blaszak </em>(C.A.6, 2003), 349 F.3d 881, in which the court of appeals affirmed his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"331\">*331</page-number>{\u00b6 2} On August 12, 2002, relator, Disciplinary Counsel, charged that respondent\u2019s conviction constituted professional misconduct. A panel of the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline heard the cause, including the parties\u2019 comprehensive stipulations, and made findings of misconduct and a recommendation, all of which the board adopted.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-5\">Misconduct</p>\n<p id=\"b409-6\">{\u00b6 3} The board found that respondent pleaded guilty, conditioned on the outcome of his appeal, to selling testimony, a violation of Section 201(c)(3), Title 18, U.S.Code, which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b409-7\">{\u00b6 4} \u201cWhoever * * * directly or indirectly, demands, seeks, receives, accepts, or agrees to receive or accept anything of value personally for or because of the testimony under oath or affirmation given or to be given by such person as a witness upon any such trial, hearing, or other proceeding, or for or because of such person\u2019s absence therefrom; shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for not more than two years, or both.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b409-8\">{\u00b6 5} The proscription against selling testimony, a felony, does not apply to \u201cthe payment or receipt of witness fees provided by law, or the payment, by the party upon whose behalf a witness is called and receipt by a witness, of the reasonable cost of travel and subsistence incurred and the reasonable value of time lost in attendance at any such trial, hearing, or proceeding, or in the case of expert witnesses, a reasonable fee for time spent in the preparation of such opinion, and in appearing and testifying.\u201d Section 201(d), Title 18, U.S.Code. The prohibition against giving value for testimony has also been held inapplicable to government solicitations of truthful testimony in furtherance of a criminal prosecution. <em>United States v. Ware </em>(C.A.6, 1998), 161 F.3d 414, 418-419.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-9\">{\u00b6 6} Respondent\u2019s conviction resulted after he offered to sell truthful testimony to RE/MAX International (\u201cRE/MAX\u201d), the plaintiff in a pending antitrust suit. Respondent believed at the time that he possessed information that would be very important, a \u201csmoking gun,\u201d to RE/MAX\u2019s case, although the actual evidentiary weight of his testimony remains unclear. After respondent solicited RE/MAX to purchase his testimony, an FBI investigation ensued. A special agent posing as a RE/MAX representative met with respondent on two days in March 2000 and listened to respondent\u2019s incriminating proposals.</p>\n<p id=\"b409-10\">{\u00b6 7} Respondent initially offered to testify in return for $500,000, with which he wanted to finance a mortgage and title company to manage, and $5,000 per month for his continuing legal services. The undercover agent, however, told respondent that RE/MAX did not need his legal services. Respondent thus agreed to accept $500,000 for his testimony, with a $50,000 down payment to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"332\">*332</page-number>remitted at their second meeting. Respondent was charged with selling testimony when he took the $50,000 down payment.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-5\">{\u00b6 8} On appeal, respondent argued that \u201cin the absence of evidence that the testimony he proposed to provide was, in fact, manufactured or otherwise untruthful,\u201d his conviction under Section 201(c)(3), Title 18, U.S.Code, violated his rights to due process and freedom of speech. <em>Blaszak, </em>349 F.3d at 883. The court of appeals found no constitutional infringement and affirmed, though acknowledging that \u201c[t]he government has offered no evidence that Blaszak was attempting to provide false testimony on RE/MAX\u2019s behalf\u2019 and that there were \u201cno reported cases, in this or other jurisdictions, sustaining a conviction for demanding payment in exchange for truthful testimony under \u00a7 201(c)(3).\u201d Id. at 886. In the process, the court rejected as unreliable <em>Golden Door Jewelry Creations, Inc. v. Lloyds Underwriters </em>(S.D.Fla.1994), 865 F.Supp. 1516, which held that accompanying Section 201(c)(2) (prohibiting a promise or offer of something of value in exchange for testimony) did not apply to truthful testimony. <em>Blaszak, </em>349 F.3d at 886.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-6\">{\u00b6 9} Respondent was sentenced to three years of supervised probation, fined $5,000, and ordered to complete 500 hours of community service. He quickly completed the terms of his probation, and his probation was terminated more than one year early.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-7\">{\u00b6 10} The parties stipulated and the board found that respondent had violated DR 1-102(A)(5) (barring conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice) and 1-102(A)(6) (barring conduct that adversely reflects on the lawyer\u2019s fitness to practice law). The board also found a violation of DR 1-102(A)(4) (barring conduct involving fraud, deceit, dishonesty, or misrepresentation), concluding that despite the undercover agent\u2019s refusal of respondent\u2019s offered legal services, respondent negotiated a $500,000 sham contract for monthly \u201clegal fee\u201d installments as payment for his testimony. The board did not, however, find a violation of DR 1-102(A)(3) (barring illegal conduct involving moral turpitude). The board concluded that respondent\u2019s crime, which he had obviously committed for profit, did not manifest the \u201crequisite lack of social conscience and depravity\u201d or \u201cunmitigated interest in personal financial gain at the expense of public or client coffers, which has been the hallmark of most theft-related DR 1-102(A)(3) violations in the past.\u201d <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Burkhart </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 188, 191, 661 N.E.2d 1062.</p>\n<p id=\"b410-8\">Sanction</p>\n<p id=\"b410-9\">{\u00b6 11} In recommending a sanction for this misconduct, the board considered the aggravating and mitigating features of respondent\u2019s case, finding that the mitigating factors far outweighed the aggravating factors. See Section 10 of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"333\">*333</page-number>Rules and Regulations Governing Procedure on Complaints and Hearings Before the Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline (\u201cBCGD Proc.Reg.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-4\">{\u00b6 12} As mitigating, the board found that respondent, who had been in practice for over 30 years, has no prior disciplinary record. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(a). The board was also convinced that respondent\u2019s conviction represented an isolated incident in an otherwise unblemished legal career. See <em>Toledo Bar Assn. v. Kramer </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 321, 323, 731 N.E.2d 643. Respondent also admitted his misconduct, reported his conviction to disciplinary authorities himself, and cooperated fully in the disciplinary process. BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(d). Moreover, he presented approximately 90 letters confirming his good character and integrity apart from the underlying events, with at least eight judges among the many attorneys, public officials, former clients, and friends who came to his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">{\u00b6 13} In addition, respondent had before his suspension from practice been active in the Ohio State Bar Association and the Lorain County Bar Association, where he had served on the executive committee, the ethics committee, and as chair of the real estate section. Respondent had served as the law director, as chair of the zoning board of appeals, and as vice-chair of the parks and recreation commission for Elyria. He had also taught real estate law at Lorain County Community College.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">{\u00b6 14} The board found that these were just a few examples of respondent\u2019s long history of legal and volunteer work for his community in addition to his many years of practice as a real estate lawyer in northeast Ohio. Such charitable works and civic involvement are mitigating factors that weigh in an attorney\u2019s favor in determining the appropriate sanction for misconduct. <em>Cuyahoga Cty. Bar Assn. v. Hardiman, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 260, 2003-Ohio-5596, 798 N.E.2d 369, \u00b6 16. Moreover, respondent\u2019s sincere desire to return to the legal profession and his character references persuaded the board that the bench and bar would welcome him back.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-7\">{\u00b6 15} After his interim suspension in 2002, respondent took 120 classroom hours to apply for an Ohio real estate license. Because of his felony conviction, he needed a waiver under R.C. 4735.09 to be eligible to sit for the real estate licensing examination. The Ohio Department of Commerce Division of Real Estate &amp; Professional Licensing granted the waiver, writing: \u201cBased on the information and numerous references that you provided, * * * you have shown by preponderance of evidence that you are honest, truthful, and of good reputation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b411-8\">{\u00b6 16} Also, notwithstanding his completion of 500 hours of community service under the terms of his probation, respondent has continued volunteering for the American Red Cross.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"334\">*334</page-number>{\u00b6 17} As an aggravating factor, the board found that respondent\u2019s crime was motivated by self-interest and profit, adding that \u201cthe $50,000 check he accepted in the FBI sting obviously blinded him to the impropriety and illegality of the act.\u201d And although respondent acknowledged the wrongful nature of his conduct, the board had some reservations. See BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(1)(g). At the panel hearing, respondent on occasion resisted admissions concerning whether he had at the time of his crime realized the illegitimacy of his conduct. He claimed that he had not realized that his negotiations were wrong and that he did not enter into them intending to commit a crime, preferring to call his conduct a terrible \u201clapse in judgment\u201d or a \u201cterrible mistake.\u201d According to the board, respondent seemed to believe, as he argued on appeal, that \u201cthere is something wrong with the federal statute rather than with his conduct.\u201d Because of this, the board shared the impression expressed by the federal district judge at respondent\u2019s sentencing, who said:</p>\n<p id=\"b412-5\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cI have to tell you I am not convinced, very frankly, that you believe what you did was wrong. I believe you are sorry, but I am not convinced that you really believe what you did was wrong.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b412-6\">{\u00b6 19} On the other hand, the board also found that respondent was deeply remorseful and that he had paid a dear price for his misconduct on many levels\u2014 from his criminal sentence, to public embarrassment, to hurting his family, and to financial ruin, including having to file personal bankruptcy after his indictment. See BCGD Proc.Reg. 10(B)(2)(f). Again agreeing with the sentencing judge\u2019s observation, the board, like the federal district court, felt confident that respondent would never violate the law again, and that he \u201cwill and can make future contributions obviously to [his] family but also to society.\u201d Based on respondent\u2019s testimony, which appeared heartfelt, and the overwhelming volume of character references, the board further found that \u201cthis painful passage through the federal criminal process and the Ohio disciplinary system appears to have had a positive influence on the Respondent that would serve him and his future clients well if his license is reinstated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b412-7\">{\u00b6 20} Relator recommended an indefinite suspension; respondent suggested a two-year suspension with credit for the time under suspension that he has already served. The board supported, as had the hearing panel, respondent\u2019s recommendation. Adopting this recommendation makes respondent immediately eligible to apply for reinstatement pursuant to Gov.Bar R. V(10)(A). Relator has nof objected to the board\u2019s recommendation.</p>\n<p id=\"b412-8\">{\u00b6 21} Upon review, we agree that respondent violated DR 1-102(A)(4), 1-102(A)(5), and 1-102(A)(6) as found by the board. We further agree with the board\u2019s recommendation. Quoting the panel\u2019s report, the board explained:</p>\n<p id=\"b413-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"335\">*335</page-number>{\u00b6 22} \u201cThe panel\u2019s recommendation is supported by analogous authority. For example, in <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Smith, </em>69 Ohio St.3d 475 [633 N.E.2d 1117] (1994), a federal public defender\u2019s conviction for theft of government property\u2014 for selling information \u2014 violated DR 1-102(A)(3), DR 1-102(A)(4) and DR 1-102(A)(6). The conviction was found to be an isolated incident. The Court rejected the Relator\u2019s recommendation of indefinite suspension and, instead, suspended respondent for two years with credit for time served under an interim suspension. Similarly, in <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Burkhart, 75 </em>Ohio St.3d 188 [661 N.E.2d 1062] (1996), [an attorney\u2019s] conviction for theft in office and receiving stolen property violated DR 1-102(A)(4) and DR 1-102(A)(6). The Court rejected Relator\u2019s recommendation of an indefinite suspension, and instead ordered a two-year suspension with credit for interim suspension. The Court stated: \u2018[W]e are confident that respondent will never repeat her crimes and, like the board, consider further review of her character and professional competence unnecessary.\u2019 Id. at 191 [661 N.E.2d 1062].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b413-5\">{\u00b6 23} In accepting the recommended sanction, we acknowledge that we have imposed an indefinite suspension for professional misconduct involving attorneys who suggested that bribery could accomplish a certain result. <em>Dayton Bar Assn. v. </em>O\u2019Brien, 103 Ohio St.3d 1, 2004-Ohio-3939, 812 N.E.2d 1263 (attorney indefinitely suspended for suggesting to client that judge would allow withdrawal of guilty plea for money); <em>Columbus Bar Assn. v. Benis </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 199, 5 OBR 415, 449 N.E.2d 1305 (attorney indefinitely suspended for offering to influence a member of the governor\u2019s staff to get clemency for a client\u2019s husband); and <em>Ohio State Bar Assn. v. Consoldane </em>(1977), 50 Ohio St.2d 337, 4 O.O.3d 477, 364 N.E.2d 279 (attorney indefinitely suspended for suggesting that he could obtain client\u2019s shock probation with a bribe). And we have disbarred attorneys for consummating this corruption. <em>Cleveland Bar Assn. v. Jurek </em>(1991), 62 Ohio St.3d 318, 581 N.E.2d 1356 (attorney\u2019s bribing of bond commissioner to avoid random judicial assignments warranted permanent disbarment); <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. DiCarlantonio </em>(1994), 68 Ohio St.3d 479, 628 N.E.2d 1355 (city attorney who received $15,000 for his part in changing fire ordinance was disbarred). See, also, <em>Disciplinary Counsel v. Atkin </em>(1999), 84 Ohio St.3d 383, 704 N.E.2d 244 (attorney disbarred for misrepresenting to client that presiding federal judge could be bribed, allegations that provoked an investigation and damaged the judge\u2019s reputation).</p>\n<p id=\"b413-6\">{\u00b6 24} In none of these cases, however, did the attorneys provide the overwhelming evidence of mitigation that respondent has presented here. The sheer volume of reference letters is impressive, but we are most moved by the extensive gratitude and appreciation these authors express for respondent\u2019s professional assistance in their lives and his achievements in the courts and community. There is little doubt that these authors knew of respondent\u2019s conviction, yet their <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"336\">*336</page-number>respect for his competence and integrity was undimmed. These testimonials, together with respondent\u2019s contrition, completion of his sentence, cooperation, the over two years his license has already been suspended, and his heretofore exemplary record of professional and community service convince us that respondent should be returned to the practice of law.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AJgC\">Jonathan E. Coughlan, Disciplinary Counsel, and Brian Shinn, Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A_c\">Mary L. Cibella, for respondent.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">{\u00b6 25} Accordingly, respondent is hereby suspended from the practice of law in Ohio for two years; however, he is credited for the interim suspension that began on June 4, 2002. As of the date of this order, respondent is eligible to apply for reinstatement pursuant to Gov.Bar R. V(10)(A).
