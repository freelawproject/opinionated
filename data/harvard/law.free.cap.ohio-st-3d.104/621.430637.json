It is undisputed that Hofer\u2019s negligence caused the accident. Hofer had no automobile insurance coverage in effect at the time of the accident. Chenault\u2019s insurer, Grange Insurance Company, paid the limits of Chenault\u2019s uninsured-motorist coverage, $25,000, to Chenault\u2019s estate.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-6\">{\u00b6 2} Chenault\u2019s relatives sought recovery under the uninsured-motorist provisions of their own policies. Defendant-appellant Motorists Mutual Insurance Company (\u201cMotorists\u201d) had issued automobile-insurance policies, which were in effect at the time of the accident, to plaintiff-appellee Marilyn Ponser, Chenault\u2019s mother, and plaintiffs-appellees Verlin and Freda Mathis, Chenault\u2019s maternal grandparents. Defendant-appellant Nationwide Insurance Company (\u201cNationwide\u201d) had issued an automobile-insurance policy to plaintiff-appellee Jeanette Romine, Chenault\u2019s maternal aunt.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-7\">{\u00b6 3} Regarding uninsured-motorist coverage, the Motorists Mutual policies state:</p>\n<p id=\"b700-8\">{\u00b6 4} \u201cA. We will pay compensatory damages which an insured is legally entitled to recover from the owner or operator of:</p>\n<p id=\"b700-9\">{\u00b6 5} \u201c1. An uninsured motor vehicle * *</p>\n<p id=\"b700-10\">{\u00b6 6} The duties of the insured after an accident or loss are set forth as follows in the Motorists policies:</p>\n<p id=\"b700-11\">{\u00b6 7} \u201cPART E \u2014 DUTIES AFTER AN ACCIDENT OR LOSS</p>\n<p id=\"b700-12\">{\u00b6 8} \u2018We have no duty to provide coverage under this policy unless there has been full compliance with the following duties:</p>\n<p id=\"b700-13\">{\u00b6 9} \u201cA. We must be notified promptly of how, when and where the accident or loss happened. Notice should also include the names and addresses of any injured persons and of any witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-14\">{\u00b6 10} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b700-15\">{\u00b6 11} \u201cC. A person seeking Uninsured Motorist Coverage must also:</p>\n<p id=\"b700-16\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c1. Promptly notify the police if a hit and run driver is involved.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-17\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c2. Promptly send us copies of the legal papers if a suit is brought.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b700-18\">{\u00b6 14} The Nationwide policy provides uninsured-motorists coverage as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b700-19\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cWe will pay compensatory damages as a result of bodily injury suffered by you or a relative and due by law from the owner or driver of an uninsured motor vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b701-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"623\">*623</page-number>{\u00b6 16} The duties of an insured under the Nationwide policy include the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b701-5\">{\u00b6 17} \u201c1. The insured must:</p>\n<p id=\"b701-6\">{\u00b6 18} \u201ca) submit written proof of the claim to us. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b701-7\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b701-8\">{\u00b6 20} \u201c2. After notice of claim, we may require the insured to take legal action against any liable party.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-9\">{\u00b6 21} \u201c3. An insured may bring legal action against the other party for bodily injury. A copy of any paper served in this action must be sent to us at once.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-10\">{\u00b6 22} <em>\u201c4. </em>The insured must:</p>\n<p id=\"b701-11\">{\u00b6 23} \u201ca) obtain our written consent to:</p>\n<p id=\"b701-12\">{\u00b6 24} \u201c(1) settle any legal action brought against any liable party; or</p>\n<p id=\"b701-13\">{\u00b6 25} \u201c(2) release any liable party.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-14\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cb) preserve and protect our right to subrogate against any liable party.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b701-15\">{\u00b6 27} By letters dated June 5, 2000, appellees informed their insurance carriers that they were making uninsured-motorist claims for injuries arising out of Chenault\u2019s accident. In the letters that Ponser and the Mathises sent to Motorists (Romine\u2019s letter to Nationwide is not part of the record), they related that no recovery could be had against Hofer: \u201cMr. Hofer had no liability insurance policy in effect on the date of the accident, and otherwise has no assets which are available for garnishment.\u201d None of the appellees filed a claim against Hofer within the two-year statute of limitations for wrongful-death actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-16\">{\u00b6 28} Appellees received no payments from their insurers on their claims, and on June 7, 2001, they filed complaints against their respective insurers: Marilyn Ponser and Verlin and Freda Mathis brought claims against Motorists, and Jeanette Romine filed a complaint against Nationwide. The trial court consolidated the cases on January 9, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-17\">{\u00b6 29} On April 2, 2002, Nationwide moved for summary judgment, arguing, \u201c[Bjecause [Romine] is no longer legally entitled to recover [from] the tortfeasor Charles Hofer since a lawsuit was not filed against Hofer within the applicable two-year statute of limitations, [she] is unable to recover under the uninsured motorist portion of her policy.\u201d On April 8, 2002, Motorists moved for summary judgment, making the same argument as to the claims of Ponser and the Mathises.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-18\">{\u00b6 30} The trial court granted summary judgment to Nationwide and Motorists on June 24, 2002. The court held:</p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"624\">*624</page-number>{\u00b6 31} \u201cBy not including Mr. Hofer as a tortfeasor, or separately filing suit against Mr. Hofer prior to June 10, 2001, the Plaintiffs have failed to fulfill a substantive element of their wrongful death causes of action, and those causes of action extinguished on June 10, 2001. Accordingly, Plaintiffs are not legally entitled to recover damages from the tortfeasor, and therefore are precluded by law from receiving UM benefits under the policies, and under R.C. 3937.18.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b702-5\">{\u00b6 32} The court of appeals reversed the trial court\u2019s judgment. The appellate court found that the phrase \u201clegally entitled to recover damages\u201d in R.C. 3937.18(A) is ambiguous \u201csince the statute does not specify at what point in time the determination of whether an insured is legally entitled to recover damages from the owner or operator of an uninsured vehicle is to be made.\u201d The court found that the statute is susceptible to an interpretation that the determination is to be made at the time of the accident. The court found that on the date of the accident, the appellees could prove both liability and damages. The court concluded:</p>\n<p id=\"b702-6\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cBecause of ambiguity in the statute as to when the insured must be \u2018legally entitled to recover,\u2019 and because R.C. 3937.18 is a remedial statute to be liberally construed to give effect to the remedy it provides,\u201d failing to sue Hofer within two years of the accident did not serve as a basis to deny uninsured motorist coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-7\">{\u00b6 34} The court of appeals also found that the Motorists policies\u2019 requirement that the insured be \u201clegally entitled to recover\u201d was ambiguous and that the ambiguity must be construed in favor of the policyholder. The court again found that under one interpretation of the policy, the insureds\u2019 claims accrued when Chenault died, at which point appellees had been able to demonstrate their claims against the tortfeasor and therefore had been \u201clegally entitled to recover.\u201d The court found that the same reasoning applied to the Nationwide policy\u2019s requirement that the insured\u2019s damages be \u201cdue by law from the owner or driver.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b702-8\">{\u00b6 35} The appellate court granted a motion to certify a conflict, finding its judgment to be in conflict with the judgments of the Fourth District Court of Appeals in <em>Hutchison v. Midwestern Indemn. Co. </em>(Aug. 5, 1987), 4th Dist. No. 1352, 1987 WL 15488, and <em>Hutchison v. Midwestern Indemn. Co. </em>(Mar. 2, 1989), 4th Dist. No. 1496, 1989 WL 19380, and the judgments of the Eighth District Court of Appeals in <em>McDonald v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. </em>(Aug. 10, 2000), 8th Dist. No. 76808, 2000 WL 1144972, and <em>Bielefeld v. State Farm Mut. Ins. Co. </em>(Nov. 3,1994), 8th Dist. No. 67093, 1994 WL 614991.</p>\n<p id=\"b702-9\">{\u00b6 36} In case No. 2003-2125, this court determined that a conflict exists over the following question:</p>\n<p id=\"b702-10\">{\u00b6 37} \u201cIf an insured does not file a wrongful death suit against the tortfeasor with[in] the two year statute of limitations set forth in R.C. 2125.02(D), is he or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"625\">*625</page-number>she \u2018legally entitled to recover damages\u2019 against the tortfeasor under R.C. 3937.18 and, therefore, able to maintain an un[der]insured or uninsured motorists claim?\u201d 101 Ohio St.3d 214, 2004-Ohio-714, 803 N.E.2d 814.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-5\">{\u00b6 38} This court also granted jurisdiction pursuant to the acceptance of a discretionary appeal (case No. 2003-1730) and consolidated the two appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-6\">Law and Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b703-7\">{\u00b6 39} We hold that the answer to the certified-conflict question is relevant to this case only if the contracts between the parties do not themselves address the issue of the necessity of the insureds\u2019 filing suit against the tortfeasor. We find that the contracts at issue in this case make filing a lawsuit nonmandatory, thus obviating any need for this court to interpret R.C. 3937.18.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-8\">{\u00b6 40} R.C. 3937.18, as it existed when the contracts of insurance were entered into, required insurers to offer their insureds uninsured-motorist coverage. Former R.C. 3937.18 stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b703-9\">{\u00b6 41} \u201c(A) No automobile liability * * * policy of insurance * * * shall be delivered or issued for delivery in this state * * * unless both of the following coverages are offered to persons insured under the policy for loss due to bodily injury or death suffered by such insureds:</p>\n<p id=\"b703-10\">{\u00b6 42} \u201c(1) Uninsured motorist coverage, which shall be in an amount of coverage equivalent to the automobile liability or motor vehicle liability coverage and shall provide protection for bodily injury, sickness, or disease, including death under provisions approved by the superintendent of insurance, for the protection of insureds thereunder who are <em>legally entitled to recover damages </em>from owners or operators of uninsured motor vehicles because of bodily injury, sickness, or disease, including death, suffered by any person insured under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-11\">{\u00b6 43} \u201cFor purposes of division (A)(1) of this section, <em>an insured is legally entitled to recover damages if the insured is able to prove the elements of the insured\u2019s claim that are necessary to recover damages from the owner or operator of the uninsured motor vehicle.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) 147 Ohio Laws, Part II, 2372-2373.</p>\n<p id=\"b703-12\">{\u00b6 44} Former R.C. 3937.18 set forth the minimum uninsured-motorist coverage that insurers had to offer their insureds. Nothing in former R.C. 3937.18 prohibited parties from contracting for more liberal coverage than that set forth in the statute. Nor did the statute set forth what an insured must do to recover under a particular policy. The statute ensured only that uninsured-motorist coverage was offered to insureds. Although former R.C. 3937.18 makes some contract terms expressly legal if agreed to by the parties, it does not set forth the terms between the parties. Those terms are set forth in the individual contracts <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"626\">*626</page-number>between insurers and insureds, and those contracts are where we look to resolve this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-5\">{\u00b645} Under its policies, Motorists agreed to \u201cpay compensatory damages which an insured is <em>legally entitled to recover </em>from the owner or operator of * * * [a]n uninsured motor vehicle.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b704-6\">{\u00b6 46} Nationwide agrees in its policy to \u201cpay compensatory damages as a result of bodily injury suffered by [the insured] or a relative and <em>due by law </em>from the owner or driver of an uninsured motor vehicle.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b704-7\">{\u00b6 47} We find no meaningful distinction between the \u201clegally entitled to recover\u201d language of the Motorists policies and the \u201cdue by law\u201d language of the Nationwide policy. We will evaluate the contracts the same way. In neither case must we resort to former R.C. 3937.18 to determine the intent of the parties. Parties\u2019 intent \u201cis presumed to reside in the language they chose to employ in the agreement.\u201d <em>Kelly v. Med. Life Ins. Co. </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 130, 31 OBR 289, 509 N.E.2d 411, paragraph one- of the syllabus. We look to other evidence of parties\u2019 intent \u201conly where the language is unclear or ambiguous, or where the circumstances surrounding the agreement invest the language of the contract with a special meaning.\u201d Id. at 132, 31 OBR 289, 509 N.E.2d 411.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-8\">{\u00b6 48} To determine whether an insured must file a wrongful-death action within the statute of limitations in order to meet the contract requirement of being legally entitled to recover, we need look only to the contracts. All three contracts set forth roadmaps for recovery, the steps an insured must follow to ensure coverage. Appellants failed to include the filing of a lawsuit against the tortfeasor among the mandatory duties of an insured. Additionally, the policies employ language establishing that the filing of suit against the tortfeasor is done at the insured\u2019s discretion or at the insurer\u2019s request, contradicting any claim that filing a lawsuit is required in order to be \u201clegally entitled to recover\u201d and thus mandatory for recovery.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-9\">{\u00b6 49} The Motorists policies are clear about what an insured \u201cmust\u201d do, including giving prompt notice of \u201chow, when and where the accident or loss happened.\u201d The Motorists policies also require a person seeking uninsured-motorist coverage to \u201cpromptly send [Motorists] copies of the legal papers <em>if </em>a suit is brought.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Sending copies of legal papers is mandatory, but bringing a suit is not.</p>\n<p id=\"b704-10\">{\u00b6 50} Similarly, the Nationwide policy states that an insured \u201cmust\u201d submit a proof of claim. Filing a claim against the tortfeasor, however, is discretionary, to be done at the option of the insured or Nationwide. The policy provides that \u201c[a]fter notice of claim, we <em>may </em>require the insured to take legal action against any liable party\u201d and that \u201c[a]n insured <em>may </em>bring legal action against the other party for bodily injury.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b705-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>{\u00b6 51} Nothing in either policy alerts an insured that he must file, suit to recover benefits under his uninsured-motorist coverage. Moreover, neither company, despite their knowledge of appellees\u2019 claims, requested that any appellee file suit against Hofer.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-5\">{\u00b6 52} The issue of whether an insured must file a lawsuit against the tortfeasor is dealt with clearly within the contracts and thus is not reliant on this court\u2019s interpretation of the \u201clegally entitled .to recover\u201d language of former R.C. 3937.18(A)(1). Each policy sets forth what an insured must do to recover under the policy, and filing suit against a tortfeasor is not among the listed duties. Even if we were to determine that filing a lawsuit against the tortfeasor is included in the meaning of the phrase \u201clegally entitled to recover\u201d in former R.C. 3937.18, that meaning would not control over the express meaning of the language in the contracts. Under the contracts, filing a lawsuit against the tortfeasor is not mandatory. Thus, to prove that they are legally entitled to recover, the insureds must establish fault on the part of the uninsured motorist and the extent of their damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-6\">{\u00b6 53} We agree with the court of appeals that there is no evidence that the appellees breached the subrogation provisions in their respective policies. The insureds informed the insurers within a year of the accident that they had suffered damages from an uninsured tortfeasor. A February 27, 2001 letter from Motorists (i.e., within the two-year statute of limitations) reflects that its delay in settling its insureds\u2019 claims was not due in any part to a concern that the insureds were not preserving Motorists\u2019 subrogation rights against Hofer but to the possible presence of other insurance in the case as a result of a so-called ScottPontzer claim being brought by Chenault\u2019s estate. See <em>Scott-Pontzer v. Liberty Mut Fire Ins. Co. </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 660, 710 N.E.2d 1116.</p>\n<p id=\"b705-7\">{\u00b6 54} We note, however, that when an uninsured tortfeasor is not judgment-proof, an insurers\u2019 contractual subrogation rights would be harmed by the failure of an insured to bring a wrongful-death claim against the tortfeasor. Nationwide claims that affirming the court of appeals would allow an insured, \u201cby his or her own activity or inactivity, to thwart the carriers\u2019 subrogation rights against a tortfeasor\u201d and would \u201cbring[ ] Ohio ever closer to a no fault state despite the fact that the legislature has clearly not done so.\u201d Motorists writes that an affirmance \u201cwould permit insureds to abandon their claims against the wrongdoer and proceed directly against their [uninsured-motorist] carrier\u201d and that \u201cthe scope of all [uninsured-motorist] coverage would be altered such that it would be converted from a third-party coverage, requiring liability on behalf of the alleged tortfeasor to be proven, to a first party coverage much like health insurance.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b705-8\">{\u00b6 55} However, our decision in <em>Ferrando v. Auto-Owners Mut. Ins. Co., </em>98 Ohio St.3d 186, 2002-Ohio-7217, 781 N.E.2d 927, remains a roadblock to any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>parade of horribles envisioned by appellants. As we held in paragraph two of the syllabus of that case:</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AYy\">Morrow, Gordon &amp; Byrd, Ltd., and Adam K. Vernau, for appellees.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AtY\">Keener, Doucher, Curley &amp; Patterson, L.P.A., W. Charles Curley and Jenifer J. Murphy, for appellant Motorists Mutual Insurance Company.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AHn0\">Gary L. Grubler, for appellant Nationwide Insurance Company.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AJqz\">Weston, Hurd, Fallon, Paisley &amp; Howley, L.L.P., Daniel A. Richards and Warren Rosman, urging reversal for amicus curiae Ohio Association of Civil Trial Attorneys.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AF9\">Davis &amp; Young and Richard M. Garner, urging reversal for amicus curiae Westfield Insurance Company.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b706-5\">{\u00b6 56} \u201cWhen an insurer\u2019s denial of underinsured motorist coverage is premised on the insured\u2019s breach of a consent-to-settle or other subrogation-related provision in a policy of insurance, the insurer is relieved of the obligation to provide coverage if it is prejudiced by the failure to protect its subrogation rights. An insured\u2019s breach of such a provision is presumed prejudicial to the insurer absent evidence to the contrary.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b706-6\">{\u00b6 57} Thus, the contractual right to subrogation still protects insurers. Here, the insurers denied coverage, not because valuable subrogation rights had been materially affected, but because appellees had failed to perform a ministerial act of no practical value. Appellees\u2019 failure to file suit against Hofer had no substantive effect on the insurers. The contracts are written such that only a prejudicial lapse by an insured can result in a denial of coverage. The insurers here were on notice of appellees\u2019 claims for a year, and waited while the clock ticked on the statute of limitations for a fruitless cause of action against a destitute tortfeasor. Appellants seek a result that elevates form over substance. But here, even the form, the insurance contract, does not support them.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-7\">{\u00b6 58} We conclude that appellees\u2019 failure to file a wrongful-death action against the uninsured tortfeasor in this case does not affect appellees\u2019 ability to recover uninsured-motorist benefits pursuant to their insurance contracts.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-8\">{\u00b6 59} Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b706-9\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b706-10\">Resnick, F.E.
