Lecklider, was employed as a head cook for Green-ville City Schools. As head cook, Lecklider was responsible for preparing the daily meal and for storing food and supplies in the school kitchen. One of the qualifications of the head-cook position is that the person be \u201c[p]hysically capable of lifting food containers as required.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b349-11\">{\u00b6 2} In October 2001, Lecklider underwent surgery to repair a large rectocele.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> According to Lecklider, following the surgery, she experienced rectal pain and spasms when she lifted heavy objects. In February 2002, Maria B. LimKong, M.D., Lecklider\u2019s surgeon and treating physician, wrote a letter authorizing Lecklider, who had not yet fully recovered from surgery, to return to work, with the following restrictions: (1) that she work a maximum of four hours per day and (2) that she not lift more than five pounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b349-12\">{\u00b6 3} In March 2002, Lecklider applied to appellee, School Employees Retirement System (\u201cSERS\u201d), for disability retirement benefits. Lecklider submitted a March 2002 report from Dr. Lim-Kong. Dr. Lim-Kong diagnosed Lecklider as having pelvic discomfort, pressure, and spasms following her rectocele surgery. Dr. Lim-Kong concluded that Lecklider would remain physically incapacitated for at least the next 12 months and that Lecklider was unable to perform her previous duties as a head cook.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"272\">*272</page-number>{\u00b6 4} In April 2002, upon request by SERS, John D. Baluch, M.D., a urologist, examined Lecklider. Dr. Baluch diagnosed Lecklider with \u201cchronic intermittent rectal pain secondary to lifting,\u201d but could not identify any physical abnormalities. Dr. Baluch felt that he was not qualified to give a recommendation concerning whether Lecklider was physically unable to do her job.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-4\">{\u00b6 5} In June 2002, the medical advisory committee of SERS concluded that a second medical evaluation should be obtained before it made a recommendation concerning Lecklider\u2019s application for disability retirement benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-5\">{\u00b6 6} On August 7, 2002, Marc Cooperman, M.D., examined Lecklider. Dr. Cooperman noted that, in Lecklider\u2019s position as head cook, she \u201cis periodically required to lift boxes of food that weigh up to 50 pounds.\u201d Based on his examination, Dr. Cooperman did not \u201cfind any basis to determine that she is unable to perform her job related duties.\u201d Nevertheless, he noted that because \u201c[sjtrenuous lifting * * * may clearly be a precipitating event in the recurrence of a rectocele,\u201d he thought that a \u201cpermanent restriction on lifting, limiting her to 25 pounds would be indicated.\u201d Dr. Cooperman certified that Lecklider was not physically or mentally incapacitated for a period of at least 12 months and was able to perform her duties as a head cook.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-6\">{\u00b6 7} The medical advisory committee reviewed the application and evidence and concluded that Lecklider was not permanently disabled from performing her duties as a head cook. The committee recommended that her application be denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-7\">{\u00b6 8} On September 13, 2002, SERS agreed with the committee\u2019s recommendation and denied Lecklider\u2019s application for disability retirement benefits. By letter dated September 16, 2003, SERS notified Lecklider of its decision and her right to appeal. On September 25, 2002, Lecklider submitted a timely notice of her intent to appeal from the SERS decision and requested a personal appearance before SERS.</p>\n<p id=\"b350-8\">{\u00b6 9} On December 11, 2002, Lecklider submitted an affidavit by Sharon F. Deeter, Food Service Director/Manager for the Greenville City Board of Education, and a letter from Dr. Lim-Kong to SERS. In her affidavit, Deeter stated that she had been Lecklider\u2019s immediate supervisor and that the head cook was required to lift food containers, bags, commodities, and cases in the following manner:</p>\n<p id=\"b350-9\">{\u00b6 10} \u201cIndividuals are instructed to use the team concept in lifting heavy food containers, bags, commodities, cases, etc. Each individual is instructed to contact the building janitor if the commodity is too heavy for lifting by the team concept. The commodities in cases herein described may weigh more than 25 pounds.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b351-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"273\">*273</page-number>{\u00b6 11} Dr. Lim-Kong\u2019s letter, which was dated October 24, 2002, reiterated that Lecklider experienced rectal and pelvic spasms when she lifted or pushed heavy objects and that, based on the job descriptions, she was unable to perform any job in the school cafeteria for an indefinite period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">{\u00b6 12} On December 16, 2002, which was 91 days after the date on SERS\u2019s notice denying her application, Lecklider submitted a December 16, 2002 letter from Dr. Lim-Kong recommending that Lecklider not lift more than ten pounds. The letter further noted that this restriction was applicable from May 14, 2002, to May 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-6\">{\u00b6 13} On January 16, 2003, SERS reviewed the information submitted by Lecklider and upheld its original decision denying her application for disability retirement benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-7\">{\u00b6 14} On June 2, 2003, Lecklider filed a complaint in the Court of Appeals for Franklin County. In her complaint, as subsequently amended, Lecklider sought a writ of mandamus to compel SERS to find her entitled to disability retirement benefits. In the alternative, Lecklider requested a writ of mandamus to compel SERS to hold a hearing in which she could personally appear to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses..</p>\n<p id=\"b351-8\">{\u00b6 15} On May 18, 2004, the court of appeals denied the writ. The court of appeals rejected Lecklider\u2019s claims that SERS had abused its discretion in denying her application for disability retirement benefits and in denying her request for a personal appearance.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-9\">{\u00b6 16} This cause is now before the court upon Lecklider\u2019s appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-10\">SERS Determination: Availability of Mandamus</p>\n<p id=\"b351-11\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cThe Public School Employees Retirement System was established for the purpose of providing retirement allowances and other benefits to public school employees other than teachers.\u201d 1 Carey, Anderson\u2019s Ohio School Law Guide (2003) 627, Section 8.25; R.C. 3309.01 et seq. \u201cUnder R.C. 3309.39(C), in order to be entitled to disability retirement benefits, a SERS member must be mentally or physically incapacitated for the performance of the member\u2019s last assigned primary duty by a disability condition that is either permanent or presumed to be permanent for at least the 12 months following the filing of the application for benefits.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Stiles v. School Emp. Retirement Sys., </em>102 Ohio St.3d 156, 2004-Ohio-2140, 807 N.E.2d 353, \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b351-12\">{\u00b6 18} Because the final SERS decision is not appealable, mandamus is available to correct any abuse of discretion by SERS in denying disability retirement benefits. See <em>State ex rel. McMaster v. School Emp. Retirement Sys. </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 130, 133, 630 N.E.2d 701. SERS abuses its discretion when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>its decision is unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable. <em>Stiles, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 156, 2004-Ohio-2140, 807 N.E.2d 353, \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-5\">Denial of Disability Retirement Benefits</p>\n<p id=\"A4G\">{\u00b6 19} Lecklider asserts that SERS abused its discretion in denying her application because Dr. Cooperman\u2019s opinion was internally inconsistent. Lecklider claims that SERS could not rely on his opinion that she was not disabled, when he had found that Lecklider\u2019s job as a head cook of a school cafeteria required her to lift boxes that weighed up to 50 pounds but also found that a 25-pound lifting restriction was appropriate for her.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-6\">{\u00b6 20} As the court of appeals concluded, however, SERS did not abuse its discretion in relying on Dr. Cooperman\u2019s opinion, because Lecklider\u2019s own evidence \u2014 the affidavit of her supervisor \u2014 established that she was not required to lift heavy items by herself, but could seek assistance from co-workers or the school janitor. Insofar as Lecklider challenges SERS\u2019s and the court of appeals\u2019 use of this affidavit, she invited any error by submitting the evidence in support of her appeal of the initial SERS decision. Cf. <em>State ex rel. Ohio Dept. of Mental Health v. Nadel, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 405, 2003-Ohio-1632, 786 N.E.2d 49, \u00b6 22, quoting <em>State ex rel. Kline v. Carroll, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 404, 2002-Ohio-4849, 775 N.E.2d 517, \u00b6 27 (\u201c \u2018Under [the invited-error] doctrine, a party is not entitled to take advantage of an error that he himself invited or induced the court to make\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b352-7\">{\u00b6 21} Based on the evidence submitted to SERS, it did not abuse its discretion in denying Lecklider\u2019s application for disability retirement benefits. Dr. Cooper-man and the doctors of the medical advisory committee all concluded that Lecklider was not physically incapacitated from doing her job as a head cook. Although there was some evidence that she could not lift heavy objects, her own evidence established that her job did not require her to do so without assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-8\">Duty to Explain Decision <em>Denying </em>Disability Retirement Benefits</p>\n<p id=\"APr\">{\u00b6 22} Lecklider next asserts that SERS had a duty to specifically state the evidence it relied upon and explain the reasons for its decision to deny her application for disability retirement benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b352-9\">{\u00b623} We reject Lecklider\u2019s assertion. In mandamus proceedings, the creation of the legal duty that a relator seeks to enforce is the distinct function of the legislative branch of government, and courts are not authorized to create the legal duty enforceable in mandamus. <em>State ex rel. Woods v. Oak Hill Community Med. Ctr., Inc. </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 459, 461, 746 N.E.2d 1108. \u201c \u2018[Njothing in the statute or regulations suggests that the SERS retirement board or the members of its medical advisory board must issue a decision [stating the basis for its denial].\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Pipoly v. State Teachers Retirement Sys., </em>95 Ohio St.3d 327, 2002-Ohio-2219, 767 N.E.2d 719, \u00b6 20, quoting <em>State ex rel. Copeland v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number><em>School Emp. Retirement Sys. </em>(Aug. 5, 1999), Franklin App. No. 98AP-1173, 1999 WL 569279, appeal dismissed based on mootness (2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 1507, 728 N.E.2d 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-5\">Personal Appearance</p>\n<p id=\"b353-6\">{\u00b6 24} Lecklider also contends that SERS abused its discretion by denying her request for a personal appearance. Under the version of Ohio Adm.Code 3309-1-41(A)(4) in effect at the time of Lecklider\u2019s appeal from the initial SERS decision, \u201c[a] personal appearance [before the retirement board\u2019s retirement committee] will not be granted unless \u2018additional objective medical evidence\u2019 as defined in paragraph (A)(3) of this rule is received by the retirement board within ninety days from the date on the notice of denial or termination.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> 2000-2001 OMR 1678,1679.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-7\">{\u00b6 25} Under former Ohio Adm.Code 3309-l-41(A)(3), \u201cadditional objective medical evidence\u201d meant \u201ccurrent medical evidence documented by a licensed physician specially trained in the field of medicine pertinent to the illness or injury for which disability is claimed, and such evidence itself has not, heretofore, been submitted, and such evidence does not merely contain or reiterate findings of information contained in documents or evidence previously submitted.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-8\">{\u00b6 26} Lecklider claimed that she was entitled to a personal appearance before SERS because she had submitted Dr. Lim-Kong\u2019s December 16, 2002 letter and the December 6, 2002 affidavit of her immediate supervisor.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-9\">{\u00b6 27} Lecklider\u2019s claim is not well taken. Dr. Lim-Kong\u2019s December 16, 2002 letter was submitted after the deadline for submitting additional objective medical evidence under former Ohio Adm.Code 3309-l-41(A)(4), which expressly prohibited personal appearances if the evidence was not submitted within 90 days of the date on the notice of denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-10\">{\u00b6 28} Moreover, as the court of appeals concluded, Dr. Lim-Kong\u2019s letter essentially reiterated her February 2002 letter recommending a weight-lifting restriction for an indefinite period. The only difference was her increasing from 5 to 10 pounds the weight that Lecklider could lift.</p>\n<p id=\"b353-11\">{\u00b6 29} Finally, Lecklider\u2019s supervisor\u2019s affidavit was not \u201cadditional objective <em>medical evidence.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Ohio Adm.Code 3309-1^11. Therefore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>SERS did not abuse its discretion in rejecting Lecklider\u2019s request for a personal appearance.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AMm\">Craig A.

Smith, Assistant Attorney General, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b354-4\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b354-5\">{\u00b6 30} Based on the foregoing, SERS did not act in an unreasonable, arbitrary, or unconscionable manner in denying Lecklider\u2019s application for disability retirement benefits. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals denying the writ of mandamus.</p>\n<p id=\"b354-6\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b354-7\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, F.E.
