Among the onlookers near Jacobs Field, the Indians\u2019 ballpark, were throngs of cheering fans as well as groups of spirited protestors. The protestors, including appellees Vernon Bellecourt, Juan Reyna, James Watson, Charlene Teters, and Zizwe Tchiquka, perceived the team\u2019s moniker and Chief Wahoo logo as disparaging to Native American culture.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b517-13\">{\u00b6 2} Following animated yet peaceful speeches and marches, the protestors entered a cordoned area near Jacobs Field. In the presence of several safety personnel, the protestors doused a newspaper-stuffed effigy of Chief Wahoo with lighter fluid and set it afire. As the fire struggled to spread, Bellecourt sprayed additional lighter fluid on the effigy. The fire then quickly accelerated, and within seconds the effigy disintegrated, sending burning remnants to the sidewalk. Cleveland police extinguished what remained of the fire and arrested Bellecourt, Tchiquka, and Reyna. Shortly thereafter, Watson and Teters ignited an accelerant-soaked effigy of Little Black Sambo \u2014 apparently as an emblematic condemnation of the use of racially offensive symbols. Police then arrested Watson and Teters. Though appellant, the city of Cleveland, booked appellees on charges of aggravated arson and detained appellees overnight, the city did not prosecute appellees for violating any law.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-14\">{\u00b6 3} Pursuant to Section 1983, Title 42, U.S.Code, appellees sued the city, the arresting officers and their commander, David Regetz, and Chief of Police Rocco <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>Pollutro for civil-rights violations stemming from their allegedly baseless arrest and detention. Upon motions for summary judgment, the trial court dismissed the claims against the arresting officers and their commander. The claims against the city and Chief Pollutro were submitted to a jury. In defense, Cleveland and Pollutro argued that police arrested appellees not for burning the effigies, per se, but for burning the effigies in a manner that threatened public safety. Following the presentation of evidence, the court directed a verdict in favor of Cleveland and Pollutro. The appellate court affirmed the judgment in favor of Pollutro and reversed the judgment in favor of Cleveland. The court resolved the claims against the arresting officers and their commander on procedural grounds that have not been presented for our review. This cause is now before us pursuant to our acceptance of Cleveland\u2019s discretionary appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">{\u00b6 4} Our ultimate inquiry is whether Cleveland is liable to appellees pursuant to Section 1983, Title 42, U.S.Code, for violating their constitutional right to free speech. Such liability will attach to a municipality only if the municipality itself has inflicted a constitutionally significant injury by executing a policy or custom. <em>Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Serv. </em>(1978), 436 U.S. 658, 694, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611. Because a violation of a constitutional right is prerequisite to a Section 1983 violation, our threshold inquiry is whether Cleveland violated appellees\u2019 constitutional right to free speech. See <em>Flagg Bros., Inc. v. Brooks </em>(1978), 436 U.S. 149, 155, 98 S.Ct. 1729, 56 L.Ed.2d 185. If so, we would then proceed to resolve whether a Cleveland policy or custom was the \u201c \u2018moving force [behind] the constitutional violation.\u2019 \u201d <em>Canton v. Harris </em>(1989), 489 U.S. 378, 389, 109 S.Ct. 1197, 103 L.Ed.2d 412, quoting <em>Monell, </em>436 U.S. at 694, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">{\u00b6 5} Without question, the effigy burnings were constitutionally protected speech. See <em>Texas v. Johnson </em>(1989), 491 U.S. 397, 109 S.Ct. 2533, 105 L.Ed.2d 342. Moreover, appellees concede, and we agree, that extinguishment of the waning flames after the effigies had disintegrated does not raise an issue of constitutional significance because by that time, the protected speech had concluded. Appellees urge, however, that the right to free speech is hollow if it is exercised at the expense of arrest. Though we generally agree with this proposition, we find it inapplicable here because any suppression of speech was incidental to Cleveland\u2019s important interest in preventing harm caused by fire. See id, 491 U.S. at 407, 109 S.Ct. 2533,105 L.Ed.2d 342.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-6\">{\u00b6 6} When speech and nonspeech elements are part of the same course of conduct, \u201ca sufficiently important governmental interest in regulating the non-speech element can justify incidental limitations on First Amendment freedoms.\u201d <em>United States v. O\u2019Brien </em>(1968), 391 U.S. 367, 376, 88 S.Ct. 1673, 20 L.Ed.2d 672. A regulation is sufficiently justified \u201cif it is within the constitutional power of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>Government; if it furthers an important or substantial governmental interest; if the governmental interest is unrelated to the suppression of free expression; and if the incidental restriction on alleged First Amendment freedoms is no greater than is essential to the furtherance of that interest.\u201d Id. at 377, 88 S.Ct. 1673, 20 L.Ed.2d 672.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">{\u00b6 7} The threshold issue to <em>O\u2019Brien\u2019s </em>test is whether a governmental interest asserted by Cleveland is implicated on the facts before us. See <em>Texas v. Johnson, </em>491 U.S. at 407, 109 S.Ct. 2533, 105 L.Ed.2d 342. If the city has not asserted a pertinent interest, then we cannot apply <em>O\u2019Brien\u2019s </em>test, and the city will have failed to justify its infringement upon appellees\u2019 right to free speech. See id.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-7\">{\u00b6 8} In <em>Johnson, </em>Texas claimed, in part, that its interest in preventing breaches of the peace justified arresting Johnson for burning an American flag. The Supreme Court held that this interest was insufficient because \u201cno disturbance of the peace actually occurred or threatened to occur because of Johnson\u2019s burning of the flag.\u201d Id., 491 U.S. at 408, 109 S.Ct. 2533, 105 L.Ed.2d 342. Moreover, there was no indication that Johnson\u2019s provocative speech was intended to incite or likely to incite lawless conduct. Id. at 409, 109 S.Ct. 2533, 105 L.Ed.2d 342, citing <em>Brandenburg v. Ohio </em>(1969), 395 U.S. 444, 447, 89 S.Ct. 1827, 23 L.Ed.2d 430. In sum, Johnson was arrested for exercising a constitutional right, not for conduct that threatened the state\u2019s interest in maintaining order.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-8\">{\u00b6 9} As in <em>Johnson, </em>the conduct in question here involved expression via the burning of a symbol. Unlike in <em>Johnson, </em>however, the facts here indicate that Cleveland\u2019s asserted interest in preserving public safety was implicated. In the judgment of Cleveland\u2019s police officers, the windy conditions coupled with the spraying of additional accelerant on the already burning effigies created a hazard that was their responsibility to remedy. Though appellees emphasize that they set the fire in a cordoned area devoid of flammable property, the police were obligated to protect the public, including the protestors themselves. A video of the effigy burnings and arrests is part of our record. It shows a protestor spraying accelerant on a burning effigy and then retreating from the rapidly growing fire before burning pieces of the disintegrating effigy began floating in the wind and landing in the proximity of the protestors. These facts implicate Cleveland\u2019s asserted interest in public safety.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-9\">{\u00b6 10} Having determined that a governmental interest was implicated on the facts before us, we now apply <em>O\u2019Brien\u2019s </em>test to determine whether that interest justified an infringement upon appellees\u2019 freedom of speech. The parties do not dispute, nor do we question, that safety regulations are within Cleveland\u2019s constitutional powers or that such regulation furthers an important or substantial government interest that is generally unrelated to the suppression of free expression. Therefore, the first three prongs of <em>O\u2019Brien\u2019s </em>test are satisfied.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>{\u00b6 11} Appellees assert, however, that their arrests were not essential to further Cleveland\u2019s safety interest. In support of their position, appellees argue that prior to arrest, police should have warned them of dangers inherent to burning effigies or that the burnings would result in their arrests. In effect, appellees argue that the city erred by forgoing the lesser restriction of warnings in favor of the greater restriction of arrests.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-5\">{\u00b6 12} The success of appellees\u2019 argument depends on the applicability of strict scrutiny, the highest level of constitutional analysis. Here, however, our analysis is based on <em>O\u2019Brien\u2019s </em>relatively lenient standard that \u201cis little, if any, different from the standard applied to time, place, or manner restrictions.\u201d <em>Clark v. Community for Creative Non-Violence </em>(1984), 468 U.S. 288, 298, 104 S.Ct. 3065, 82 L.Ed.2d 221. In <em>Ward v. Rock Against Racism </em>(1989), 491 U.S. 781, 109 S.Ct. 2746, 105 L.Ed.2d 661, the Supreme Court rejected the \u201cless restrictive means\u201d argument as inapplicable to <em>O\u2019Brien\u2019s </em>test. Quoting <em>Clark </em>at 299, 104 S.Ct. 3065, 82 L.Ed.2d 221, the <em>Ward </em>court stated, \u201c \u2018We do not believe * * * that either <em>United States v. O\u2019Brien </em>or the time, place, or manner decisions assign to the judiciary the authority to replace the [United States Park Service] as the manager of the [Nation\u2019s] parks or endow the judiciary with the competence to judge how much protection of park lands is wise and how that level of conservation is to be attained.\u2019 \u201d Id., 491 U.S. at 798, 109 S.Ct. 2746, 105 L.Ed.2d 661. Though the <em>Ward </em>court spoke specifically to the regulation of parks, the unmistakable message is that under <em>O\u2019Brien\u2019s </em>standard, courts are not arbiters of whether a less restrictive means exists to effectuate an asserted governmental interest. The <em>Ward </em>court continued, \u201cLest any confusion on the point remain, we reaffirm today that a regulation of the time, place, or manner of protected speech must be narrowly tailored to serve the government\u2019s legitimate, content-neutral interests but that it need not be the least restrictive or least intrusive means of doing so. * * * [T]he regulation will not be invalid simply because a court concludes that the government\u2019s interest could be adequately served by some less-speech-restrictive alternative.\u201d Id., 491 U.S. at 798-800, 109 S.Ct. 2746, 105 L.Ed.2d 661. Thus, appellees\u2019 \u201cless restrictive means\u201d argument is without merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-6\">{\u00b6 13} Further, appellees\u2019 argument presumes that warnings would have obviated a fire hazard or that they were arrested merely for burning effigies. To be sure, the police knew that protestors intended to burn effigies. There is no indication, however, that the police had prior knowledge of the dangerous manner in which the effigies were to be burned, and it would be utterly impractical to require police to be so prescient as to issue appropriate warnings. Moreover, the record demonstrates that Cleveland arrested appellees not because they burned effigies, but because of a perceived public safety threat in the manner in which they burned the effigies. Under the facts before us, we determine that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"443\">*443</page-number>arrests were narrowly tailored to Cleveland\u2019s asserted interest in preserving public safety. Therefore, the fourth prong of <em>O\u2019Brien\u2019s </em>test is satisfied, and any incidental limitation on appellees\u2019 First Amendment freedoms was justified. Accordingly, Cleveland is not liable to appellees pursuant to Section 1983, Title 42, U.S.Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">Judgment reversed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b521-6\">Resnick, F.E.

Harris </em>(1989), 489 U.S. 378, 389, 109 S.Ct. 1197, 103 L.Ed.2d 412.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-16\">{\u00b6 19} The majority concludes that the facts implicate the city\u2019s interest in public safety, placing significance on the fact that pieces of the burned effigy \u201cland[ed] in the proximity of the protesters.\u201d However, because the protesters were charged with violating R.C. 2909.02, the city\u2019s sole interest in this particular case was to protect \u201cany person other than the offender\u201d or \u201cany occupied structure.\u201d The effigies were burned outdoors in a paved area cordoned off by metal barricades, and firefighters with extinguishers were nearby. The most one can conclude is that appellees placed themselves at \u201ca substantial risk of serious physical harm.\u201d Even though one might be concerned with the potential danger of burning effigies, there is no evidence that anyone other than the protesters were placed in any risk of serious physical harm resulting from appellees\u2019 conduct. Therefore, the city had no authority to arrest appellees based on R.C. 2909.02, and the arrests interfered with their freedom of expression guaranteed by the First Amendment.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"444\">*444</page-number>{\u00b6 20} In support of their contention that a policy of the city caused the constitutional violations, appellees assert that the city failed to adequately train its police officers how to respond to protesters who burn effigies. Under the \u201cfailure to train\u201d theory, a city can be held liable for a violation of constitutional rights by one of its police officers, pursuant to Section 1983, \u201conly where the failure to train amounts to deliberate indifference to the rights of persons with whom the police come into contact.\u201d <em>Canton, </em>489 U.S. at 388, 109 S.Ct. 1197, 103 L.Ed.2d 412. Deliberate indifference may be shown where the need for more or different training is obvious and where \u201cthe inadequacy [is] likely to result in the violation of constitutional rights.\u201d Id. at 390, 109 S.Ct. 1197, 103 L.Ed.2d 412.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">{\u00b6 21} At trial, appellees offered evidence that they previously had been arrested for burning effigies at Jacobs Field. Appellees also elicited testimony from Cleveland police and fire department personnel that the city had not conducted special training on the constitutional implications of responding to symbolic burnings. Appellees have presented evidence upon which a reasonable jury could determine that the city was deliberately indifferent to individuals\u2019 constitutional rights. Accordingly, I believe that the court of appeals properly reversed the judgment of the trial court and remanded the cause for determination whether a policy of the city caused the constitutional violation.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b522-6\">Pfeifer, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"A2Q\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-7\">{\u00b6 22} As the majority relates, ceremonial burning is protected speech in this country. But every state has prohibitions against arson. To allow arson laws to be applied to small-scale, outdoor ceremonial burnings like the one in this case defeats the free-speech protections accorded those activities.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">{\u00b6 23} Appellees were arrested for a violation of R.C. 2909.02, which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">{\u00b6 24} \u201c(A) No person, by means of fire or explosion, shall knowingly do any of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b522-10\">{\u00b6 25} \u201c(1) Create a substantial risk of serious physical harm to any person other than the offender.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b522-11\">{\u00b6 26} If there was any risk here, it was not substantial. The burnings took place in a paved area cordoned off by metal barricades with firefighters with extinguishers nearby. Moreover, the record shows that burning pieces of the effigy landed near the protestors themselves, not anyone else. I agree with the appellate court that the facts of this case do not implicate the city\u2019s asserted interest in public safety. Thus, the city lacked \u201ca sufficiently important governmental interest in regulating the nonspeech element\u201d to justify the incidental <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"445\">*445</page-number>limitation on appellees\u2019 First Amendment freedoms. <em>United States v.
