Carter reported alleged abuse of her niece to a guidance counselor at her niece\u2019s school. As a result of this report, appellee Lesley L. Nickel was tried for rape, gross sexual imposition, and sexual imposition. Nickel was found not guilty on all charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-16\">{\u00b6 <em>2} </em>After the trial, Nickel and his wife sued Carter for slander, malicious prosecution, intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligent infliction of emotional distress, conspiracy, and loss of consortium. Carter denied the allegations in the Nickels\u2019 complaint and counterclaimed for intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligent infliction of emotional distress, and assault. The trial court granted a pretrial motion to have Carter\u2019s niece, the victim of the alleged abuse, submit to a psychological evaluation pursuant to Civ.R. 35(A). The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>niece appealed from the grant of this motion. The court of appeals dismissed the appeal, determining that the trial court\u2019s order was not final and appealable. The court of appeals certified a conflict, asking: \u201cIs a ruling on a Civ.R. 35(A) motion for an independent psychological examination a final and appealable order?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b621-4\">{\u00b6 3} This cause is now before this court upon our determination that a conflict exists.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">{\u00b6 4} For the reasons that follow, we answer the certified question in the negative.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">{\u00b6 5} R.C. 2505.02(B) states:</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cAn order is a final order that may be reviewed, affirmed, modified, or reversed, with or without retrial, when it is one of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">{\u00b6 7} \u201c(1) An order that affects a substantial right in an action that in effect determines the action and prevents a judgment;</p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">{\u00b6 8} \u201c(2) An order that affects a substantial right made in a special proceeding or upon a summary application in an action after judgment;</p>\n<p id=\"b621-10\">{\u00b6 9} \u201c(3) An order that vacates or sets aside a judgment or grants a new trial;</p>\n<p id=\"b621-11\">{\u00b6 10} \u201c(4) An order that grants or denies a provisional remedy and to which both of the following apply:</p>\n<p id=\"b621-12\">{\u00b6 11} \u201c(a) The order in effect determines the action with respect to the provisional remedy and prevents a judgment in the action in favor of the appealing party with respect to the provisional remedy.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-13\">{\u00b6 12} \u201c(b) The appealing party would not be afforded a meaningful or effective <em>remedy </em>by an appeal following final judgment as to all proceedings, issues, claims, and parties in the action.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-14\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c(5) An order that determines that an action may or may not be maintained as a class action.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b621-15\">{\u00b6 14} Neither party contends that R.C. 2505.02(B)(1), (3), (4), or (5) applies to this case; accordingly, we will not discuss these provisions. Turning to R.C. 2505.02(B)(2), the order issued by the trial court is not a \u201csummary application in an action after judgment.\u201d Therefore, the issue before us turns on whether the order issued by the trial court is \u201c[a]n order that affects a substantial right made in a special proceeding.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b621-16\">{\u00b6 15} In <em>Polikoff v. Adam </em>(1993), 67 Ohio St.3d 100, 616 N.E.2d 213, syllabus, we stated, \u201cOrders that are entered in actions that were recognized at common law or in equity and were not specially created by statute are not orders entered in special proceedings pursuant to R.C. 2505.02.\u201d Each one of the claims asserted in the suit below \u2014 slander, malicious prosecution, intentional infliction of emotional distress, negligent infliction of emotional distress, conspiracy, loss of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>consortium, and assault \u2014 was recognized at common law. None of the claims were specially created by statute. We conclude that the order issued by the trial court was not issued in a special proceeding. Accordingly, we hold that the ruling on the Civ.R. 35(A) motion for an independent psychological examination in this case was not a final and appealable order and affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Aua\">Jeffrey P.
