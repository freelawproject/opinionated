Upon consideration of the motions of Terry and Nancy Poulton for leave to intervene as respondents and to dismiss, relator\u2019s motion to strike the Poultons\u2019 motion to dismiss, and respondents\u2019 motions to dismiss,</p>\n<p id=\"b750-7\">{\u00b6 2} IT IS ORDERED by the court that the motion for leave to intervene be, and hereby is, granted and that Terry and Nancy Poulton be, and hereby are, permitted to intervene as respondents.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-8\">{\u00b6 3} IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that relator\u2019s motion to strike the Poultons\u2019 motion to dismiss be, and hereby is, denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-9\">{\u00b6 4} IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that, because relator has an adequate remedy at law, respondents\u2019 motions to dismiss be, and hereby are, granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b750-10\">{\u00b6 5} IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that this cause be, and hereby is, dismissed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b750-11\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, F.E.

The underlying case, <em>Poulton v. Am. Economy Ins. Co., </em>was one of the many cases we held for our decision in <em>Westfield Ins. Co. v. Galatis, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 216, 2003-Ohio-5849, 797 N.E.2d 1256. We resolved <em>Poulton </em>in a one-line entry: \u201cThe judgment against Indiana Insurance Company is reversed.\u201d <em>In re Uninsured &amp; Underinsured Motorist Coverage Cases, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 302, 2003-Ohio-5888, 798 N.E.2d 1077, \u00b6 75. By this entry, I believe we intended to reverse the judgment against Indiana Insurance Company that was based upon a <em>Scott-Pontzer </em>cause of action. See <em>Scott-Pontzer v. Liberty Mut. Fire Ins. Co. </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 660, 710 N.E.2d 1116. Our entry did not differentiate between the auto and umbrella policies because <em>Galatis </em>applied to any judgment that was based on <em>Scottr-Pontzer, </em>where the injured party was not in the course and scope of employment, or that was based upon the related case of <em>Ezawa v. Yasuda Fire &amp; Marine Ins. Co. of Am. </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 557, 715 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"1203\">*1203</page-number>N.E.2d 1142. Our entry in <em>Poulton v. Am. Economy Ins. Co. </em>established the law of the case.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AW8g\">Pelini &amp; Fischer, Ltd., Craig G. Pelini and Julie A. Geiser, for relator.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"ARo\">John D. Ferrero, Stark County Prosecuting Attorney, and Sharon D.

Coury, for intervenors Terry and Nancy Poulton.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b751-4\">{\u00b6 7} Nevertheless, because Indiana Insurance Company has an adequate remedy in the ordinary course of law, and in fact has an appeal pending, mandamus is not proper. This case must follow its ordinary course through the appellate court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
