The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>West Virginia court awarded custody of the parties\u2019 minor child, Casandra Elizabeth Payne, d.o.b. June 23, 1990, to Morenz and ordered Payne to pay child support. Payne has been a resident of Jefferson County, Ohio, since 1994, and in November 2000, Morenz and Casandra moved from West Virginia to Springfield, Illinois.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">{\u00b6 3} In December 2003, respondent Jefferson County Child Support Enforcement Agency (\u201cJCCSEA\u201d), on behalf of Morenz and Casandra, filed a petition in the Jefferson County Court of Common Pleas, Juvenile Division, to register and enforce the May 21, 1993 West Virginia child-support order pursuant to R.C. 3115.01 to 3115.59, Ohio\u2019s version of the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act. On December 29, 2003, respondent Judge Samuel W. Kerr of the Jefferson County, Ohio juvenile court authorized the issuance of an order/notice to Payne\u2019s employer to withhold a portion of his income for child support.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">{\u00b6 4} In June 2004, Casandra left Illinois for her summer visitation with Payne in Ohio. On July 28, 2004, Morenz filed a petition in the Circuit Court of the Seventh Judicial Circuit, Sangamon County, Illinois, to register and enforce the May 21, 1993 West Virginia child-custody order and a 1994 supplemental order pursuant to the Illinois version of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, 750 Ill.Comp.Stat. 36/101 et seq. In her petition, Morenz alleged that West Virginia was no longer the appropriate jurisdiction for determination of child-custody and visitation issues concerning Casandra and that registration of the West Virginia orders in Illinois would be appropriate to enforce the judgment in Illinois.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">{\u00b6 5} On August 4, 2004, Morenz filed a petition in the Illinois court for expedited enforcement of the West Virginia child-custody determination. Morenz alleged that Payne had failed to return Casandra to her custody. On August 6, 2004, Payne filed a motion in the Jefferson County, Ohio juvenile court to modify allocation of parental rights and responsibilities. Payne sought custody of Casandra. Payne alleged that Casandra had expressed a desire to live with him because she is disturbed by Morenz\u2019s \u201clack of time and attention to her and the other two (2) children as well as by the step-father\u2019s habits, behavior and offensive words and deeds.\u201d Payne claimed that Morenz\u2019s husband \u201cmenaces the child,\u201d that he \u201cfrequently drinks Coke and Old Turkey Whiskey,\u201d and that \u201c[t]his mixture is taken with him in motor vehicles and especially when he and [Morenz] are on the road.\u201d Payne was \u201cconcerned that if the minor child is made to return to [Morenz], the minor child will be verbally, emotionally and perhaps physically abused.\u201d Payne did not expressly allege that Morenz\u2019s husband operated motor vehicles while intoxicated when Casandra was a passenger. Nor did he specify any facts indicating harm to Casandra.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"150\">*150</page-number>{\u00b6 6} On August 9, 2004, the Illinois court issued an order directing Payne to appear in court with Casandra and ordering that when they did, Morenz could take immediate physical custody of the child. On August 16, 2004, Morenz moved to dismiss the Ohio case for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">{\u00b6 7} On August 18, 2004, the Illinois court granted Morenz\u2019s petition for enforcement of the West Virginia child-custody determination and ordered Payne to immediately return Casandra to Morenz. The Illinois court determined that it had jurisdiction over the child-custody matter, that Payne had been served with its August 9 order directing him to appear in court with Casandra, and that Payne had not appeared as ordered. On August 19, Morenz moved the Jefferson County, Ohio court to enforce the Illinois custody order and on August 23, the Illinois court ordered Payne to show cause why he should not be held in contempt.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">{\u00b6 8} On August 24, 2004, the West Virginia court sent a letter to respondent Magistrate Casimir T. Adulewicz of the Jefferson County, Ohio juvenile court notifying the court that assuming certain facts, West Virginia no longer had exclusive, continuing jurisdiction under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-7\">{\u00b6 9} On August 25, the Jefferson County, Ohio juvenile court accepted and registered the West Virginia divorce decree. On September 1, 2004, the Illinois court granted Morenz\u2019s petition to register the West Virginia child-custody determination and further ordered that \u201c[a]ll issues of child custody and visitation shall be heard by the Seventh Judicial Circuit, Sangamon County, Illinois.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">{\u00b6 10} On September 2, Magistrate Adulewicz of the Jefferson County, Ohio juvenile court awarded temporary legal custody of Casandra to Payne and referred the matter to JCCSEA for investigation. The magistrate subsequently denied Morenz\u2019s request for findings of fact and conclusions of law to support his September 2 order. On September 22, Morenz filed objections to the magistrate\u2019s orders with Judge Kerr. Morenz requested that the matter be returned to the magistrate to issue findings of fact and conclusions of law to support his temporary child-custody order.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">{\u00b6 11} On October 19, Morenz filed this action against Judge Kerr, Magistrate Adulewicz, and JCCSEA. Morenz requests writs of prohibition to prevent Judge Kerr and Magistrate Adulewicz from exercising further jurisdiction in Payne\u2019s Ohio child-custody case and to prevent JCCSEA from taking any further actions against her pursuant to the magistrate\u2019s September 2 bench order. Morenz also requests writs of mandamus and procedendo to order Judge Kerr and Magistrate Adulewicz to transfer the Ohio proceedings to the Illinois court. On November 1, the magistrate filed an answer. JCCSEA\u2019s response was due on November 12, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"151\">*151</page-number>and Judge Kerr\u2019s response was due on November 15, but neither filed a timely response to Morenz\u2019s complaint.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">{\u00b6 12} This cause is now before us for our determination under S.Ct.Prac.R. X(5).</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">S.Ct.Prac.R. X(5): Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b229-7\">{\u00b6 13} Under S.Ct.Prac.R. X(5), we must now determine whether dismissal, an alternative writ, or a peremptory writ is appropriate. <em>State ex rel. Consumers\u2019 Counsel v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>102 Ohio St.3d 301, 2004-Ohio-2894, 809 N.E.2d 1146, \u00b6 9. Dismissal is required if it appears beyond doubt, after presuming the truth of all material factual allegations of the complaint and making all reasonable inferences in Morenz\u2019s favor, that Morenz is not entitled to the requested extraordinary relief in prohibition, mandamus, and procedendo. <em>Tatman v. Fairfield Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 425, 2004-Ohio-3701, 811 N.E.2d 1130, \u00b6 13. If, however, after so construing Morenz\u2019s complaint, it appears that her claims may have merit, an alternative writ should be granted, and a schedule for the presentation of evidence and briefs should be issued. Id. Finally, if the pertinent facts are uneontroverted and it appears beyond doubt that Morenz is entitled to the requested writs, we will issue peremptory writs of prohibition, mandamus, and procedendo. <em>State ex rel. Highlander v. Rudduck, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 370, 2004-Ohio-4952, 816 N.E.2d 213, \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-8\">Prohibition: Judge Kerr and Magistrate Adulewicz</p>\n<p id=\"b229-9\">{\u00b6 14} In her primary claim, Morenz seeks a writ of prohibition to prevent Judge Kerr and Magistrate Adulewicz from further proceeding in the Ohio child-custody case instituted by Payne. Morenz asserts that the judge and magistrate patently and unambiguously lack jurisdiction in the Ohio child-custody matter. \u201c Tf a lower court patently and unambiguously lacks jurisdiction to proceed in a cause, prohibition * * * will issue to prevent any future unauthorized exercise of jurisdiction and to correct the results of prior jurisdictionally unauthorized actions.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. Columbia Gas of Ohio, Inc. v. Henson, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 349, 2004-Ohio-3208, 810 N.E.2d 953, \u00b6 14, quoting <em>State ex rel. Mayer v. Henson, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 276, 2002-Ohio-6323, 779 N.E.2d 223, \u00b6 12. Therefore, \u201c[i]n cases of a patent and unambiguous lack of jurisdiction, the requirement of a lack of an adequate remedy of law need not be proven because the availability of alternate remedies like appeal would be immaterial.\u201d <em>State ex rel. State v. Lewis, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 97, 2003-Ohio-2476, 789 N.E.2d 195, \u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-10\">{\u00b6 15} For the following reasons, Judge Kerr and Magistrate Adulewicz patently and unambiguously lack jurisdiction over the child-custody proceeding, and Morenz is entitled to a peremptory writ of prohibition.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"152\">*152</page-number>{\u00b6 16} \u201cTo help resolve interstate custody disputes, the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (\u2018UCCJA\u2019) was drafted in 1968 and adopted by Ohio in 1977.\u201d <em>Justis v. Justis </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 312, 314, 691 N.E.2d 264, citing R.C. 3109.21 to 3109.37, 137 Ohio Laws, Part I, 359. Illinois also adopted the UCCJA. See 750 Ill.Comp.Stat. 36/101 et seq. The purpose of the UCCJA is \u201c \u2018to avoid jurisdictional competition and conflict with courts of other jurisdictions\u2019 \u201d in custody matters. <em>In re Complaint for Writ of Habeas Corpus for Goeller, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 427, 2004-Ohio-5579, 816 N.E.2d 594, \u00b6 12, quoting <em>In re Palmer </em>(1984), 12 Ohio St.3d 194, 196, 12 OBR 259, 465 N.E.2d 1312. \u201cTo bolster the effectiveness of the UCCJA, Congress passed the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act (\u2018PKPA\u2019), Section 1738A, Title 28, U.S.Code, in 1980, mandating that states afford full faith and credit to valid child custody orders of another state court.\u201d <em>Justis, </em>81 Ohio St.3d at 315, 691 N.E.2d 264. When the Ohio version of the UCCJA conflicts with the PKPA, the PKPA prevails. <em>State ex rel. Seaton v. Holmes, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 265, 2003-Ohio-5897, 798 N.E.2d 375, \u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">{\u00b6 17} Under the PKPA, a \u201ccourt of a State shall not exercise jurisdiction in any proceeding for a custody or visitation determination commenced during the pendency of a proceeding in a court of another State where such court of that other State is exercising jurisdiction consistently with the provisions of this section to make a custody or visitation determination.\u201d Section 1738A(g), Title 28, U.S.Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cA child custody or visitation determination made by a court of a State is consistent with the provisions of [the PKPA] only if\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c(1) such court has jurisdiction under the law of such State; and</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">{\u00b6 20} \u201c(2) one of the following conditions is met:</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">{\u00b6 21} \u201c(A) such State (i) is the home State of the child on the date of the commencement of the proceeding, or (ii) had been the child\u2019s home State within six months before the date of the commencement of the proceeding and the child is absent from the state because of his removal or retention by a contestant or for other reasons, and a contestant continues to live in such State * * *.\u201d Section 1738A(c), Title 28, U.S.Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-9\">{\u00b6 22} Judge Kerr and Magistrate Adulewicz lack jurisdiction under the PKPA to exercise jurisdiction in the child-custody matter. At the time that Payne commenced his Ohio custody proceeding \u2014 when he filed his motion on August 8, 2004, to modify allocation of parental rights and responsibilities \u2014 Morenz\u2019s Illinois proceeding for a custody determination was already pending. That is, contrary to Magistrate Adulewicz\u2019s contention, the December 2003 JCCSEA Ohio petition for enforcement of the West Virginia <em>child-support order </em>did not initiate the Ohio proceeding for a <em>custody </em>determination so as to make Ohio first in time for purposes of the PKPA. See Section 1738A(b)(3) (\u201c \u2018custody determination\u2019 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"153\">*153</page-number>means a judgment, decree, or other order of a court providing for the custody of a child, and includes permanent and temporary orders, and initial orders and modifications\u201d). And the Illinois court exercised jurisdiction consistent with the PKPA because it had jurisdiction under Illinois law, and Illinois was the home state of both Casandra and Morenz at the time the Illinois proceeding was commenced. Consequently, Judge Kerr and Magistrate Adulewicz lacked jurisdiction under Section 1738A(g), Title 28, U.S.Code, over Payne\u2019s custody action. See, generally, <em>G.B. v. Arapahoe Cty. Court </em>(Colo.1995), 890 P.2d 1153, 1160 (\u201cUnder section 1738A[g], then, Colorado could not assert jurisdiction as long as California proceedings were pending, and as long as California was exercising jurisdiction in conformity with the PKPA\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">{\u00b6 23} Similarly, Judge Kerr and Magistrate Adulewicz were also precluded from exercising jurisdiction under R.C. 3109.24(A) of Ohio\u2019s version of the UCCJA. R.C. 3109.24(A) provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cA court of this state shall not exercise its jurisdiction, if at the time of filing the petition a parenting proceeding concerning the child was pending in a court of another state exercising jurisdiction substantially in conformity with sections 3109.21 to 3109.36 of the Revised Code, unless the proceeding is stayed by the court of the other state because this state is a more appropriate forum or for other reasons.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">{\u00b6 25} At the time that Payne filed his Ohio petition for a parenting determination, Morenz had already initiated a parenting proceeding in Illinois. See R.C. 3109.21(C), defining \u201cparenting proceeding\u201d for purposes of Ohio\u2019s version of the UCCJA as \u201cproceedings in which a parenting determination is one of several issues\u201d; see, also, R.C. 3109.21(B) (\u201c \u2018Parenting determination\u2019 means a court decision and court orders and instructions that, in relation to the parents of a child, allocates parental rights and responsibilities for the care of the child, including any designation of parenting time rights, and designates a residential parent and legal custodian of the child or that, in relation to any other person, provides for the custody of a child, including visitation rights\u201d). Again, notwithstanding the magistrate\u2019s claims to the contrary, the JCCSEA petition to register and enforce the West Virginia child-support order did not make the Ohio court first in time for purposes of the UCCJA because this petition did not request a parenting determination. See R.C. 3109.21(B) (\u201c \u2018Parenting determination\u2019 * * * does not include a decision relating to child support or any other monetary obligation of any person\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">{\u00b6 26} The Illinois court that is considering Morenz\u2019s child-custody proceeding is exercising jurisdiction in conformity with the UCCJA. See 750 Ill.Comp.Stat. 36/210 and 36/203. There is also no evidence that the Illinois court has stayed its proceeding and declined jurisdiction in favor of Ohio courts.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"154\">*154</page-number>{\u00b6 27} Therefore, pursuant to R.C. 3109.24(A), Judge Kerr and Magistrate Adulewicz lack jurisdiction under the UCCJA to proceed in Payne\u2019s child-custody proceeding. This result is consistent with precedent. For example, in <em>G.B., </em>the Colorado Supreme Court held that allegations of abuse prompting a refusal to return a child after visitation in California were insufficient to divest Colorado of jurisdiction it had first acquired under the UCCJA:</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">{\u00b6 28} \u201cThis case is exactly the type of case to which the UCCJA was intended to apply. The mother wrongfully refused to return C.B. after a period of visitation, and then the mother, and not the State, initiated proceedings in Colorado which were designed to change custody of C.B. in the mother\u2019s favor. We realize that the mother alleges that her actions were necessary to protect C.B. from abuse. However, if we were to allow Colorado to assert jurisdiction as soon as the parties allege abuse, it would permit the parties to circumvent the requirements of and the policies behind the UCCJA. Additionally, the mother has had a chance to present her abuse allegations before the California court.\u201d <em>G.B., </em>890 P.2d at 1160.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-6\">{\u00b6 29} Analogously, Payne\u2019s generalized allegations of neglect and abuse are insufficient to confer jurisdiction on the Ohio court over the child-custody proceeding in the absence of the Illinois court\u2019s declining to exercise jurisdiction over Morenz\u2019s child-custody proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-7\">{\u00b6 30} This result is also consistent with the purposes of the UCCJA and PKPA to avoid jurisdictional competition and conflict between courts of different states and to assure that the state with the optimum access to the relevant facts makes a custody determination that protects the child\u2019s best interests. See <em>Seaton, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 265, 2003-Ohio-5897, 798 N.E.2d 375, \u00b6 17. Illinois, where Casandra lived with her mother from November 2000 until June 2004, manifestly has greater access than Ohio to any evidence that might support Payne\u2019s allegations concerning Morenz\u2019s alleged neglect and Morenz\u2019s husband\u2019s alleged misconduct. There is no indication here that when the Ohio court became aware of the pending Illinois proceeding, it engaged in the communication with that court required by R.C. 3109.24(B) and (C). <em>In re Adoption of Asente </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 91, 102, 734 N.E.2d 1224 (\u201cWhen a court of this state is asked to make a custody decision with respect to a child who is the subject of proceedings within the jurisdiction of another state, the UCCJA anticipates that a meaningful dialogue will occur between the judges in deciding which court is the more appropriate forum from which to decide the child custody issues\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b232-8\">{\u00b6 31} Therefore, because Judge Kerr and Magistrate Adulewicz patently and unambiguously lack jurisdiction over the underlying child-custody case because of the PKPA and UCCJA, Morenz is entitled to a peremptory writ of prohibition to prevent them from proceeding further.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>Prohibition: JCCSEA</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">{\u00b6 32} Morenz is not entitled to the requested writ of prohibition against JCCSEA. Prohibition will not lie if the respondent is not exercising judicial or quasi-judicial authority. <em>State ex rel. McGrath v. Ohio Adult Parole Auth., </em>100 Ohio St.3d 72, 2003-Ohio-5062, 796 N.E.2d 526, \u00b6 7. \u201c \u2018Quasi-judicial authority is the power to hear and determine controversies between the public and individuals that <em>require </em>a hearing resembling a judicial trial.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis sic.) <em>State ex rel. Potts v. Comm. on Continuing Legal Edn. </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 452, 455, 755 N.E.2d 886, quoting <em>State ex rel. Wright v. Ohio Bur. of Motor Vehicles </em>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 184, 186, 718 N.E.2d 908. JCCSEA is not exercising judicial or quasi-judicial authority in the underlying matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">{\u00b6 33} Therefore, we dismiss Morenz\u2019s prohibition claim against JCCSEA.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-7\">Mandamus and Procedendo: Judge Kerr and Magistrate Adulewicz</p>\n<p id=\"b233-8\">{\u00b6 34} Morenz also requests writs of mandamus and procedendo to compel Judge Kerr and Magistrate Adulewicz to transfer the child-custody proceedings to the Illinois court.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">{\u00b6 35} But our issuance of a writ of prohibition to prevent the Ohio child-custody case from proceeding renders Morenz\u2019s claim moot. The Illinois case is already proceeding, and because the Ohio court never obtained proper jurisdiction over the underlying case, there is nothing to transfer to the Illinois court. Neither mandamus nor procedendo will issue to compel a vain act. See <em>State ex rel. Moore v. Malone, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 417, 2002-Ohio-4821, 775 N.E.2d 812, \u00b6 38; <em>State ex rel. Garnett v. Lyons </em>(1975), 44 Ohio St.2d 125, 127, 73 O.O.2d 440, 339 N.E.2d 628.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-10\">{\u00b6 36} Consequently, we dismiss Morenz\u2019s mandamus and procedendo claims because they are moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-11\">Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b233-12\">{\u00b6 37} Based on the foregoing, we grant a peremptory writ of prohibition to prevent Judge Kerr and Magistrate Adulewicz from proceeding in the Ohio child-custody case. We dismiss Morenz\u2019s claims for a writ of prohibition against JCCSEA because JCCSEA is not exercising judicial or quasi-judicial authority. Finally, we dismiss Morenz\u2019s claims for writs of mandamus and procedendo against Judge Kerr and Magistrate Adulewicz based on mootness.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-13\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b233-14\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, F.E.
