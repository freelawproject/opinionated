He was hurt on June 7, 2000, when a cabinet weighing over 100 pounds fell on him. Dayton Foods unsuccessfully contested the resulting workers\u2019 compensation claim, which was ultimately allowed for \u201cleft shoulder/arm sprain, left shoulder AC arthralgia with evidence of rotator cuff tendonitis and impingement <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"300\">*300</page-number>syndrome.\u201d Since that time, Dayton Foods has contested surgical treatment and temporary total disability compensation (\u201cTCC\u201d) at almost every turn. Facts relating to Unger\u2019s attempts to get surgical treatment and TCC overlap, making a strictly chronological recitation of the facts impractical. Instead, we will set forth the facts relating to each issue separately, bringing them together only as they merge administratively and judicially.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">\n<em>Surgical-Treatment Authorization</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">{\u00b6 2} On December 7, 2000, Unger was examined, at Dayton Foods\u2019 request, by Dr. Jose Chavez. Confining his exam to what was then the only allowed condition \u2014 left shoulder/arm sprain \u2014 Dr. Chavez did not comment on Unger\u2019s rotator cuff. He felt that Unger\u2019s allowed condition had reached maximum medical improvement (\u201cMMI\u201d) and attributed Unger\u2019s continuing left-arm difficulties to a cervical disc condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">{\u00b6 3} Dr. Chavez\u2019s determination that Unger\u2019s left shoulder sprain had reached MMI was apparently the impetus for Dayton Foods\u2019 refusal thereafter to authorize further treatment. From at least February 2001, Unger\u2019s physician, Dr. Kevin Paley, suspected that Unger\u2019s rotator cuff had also been injured and made repeated requests for authorization of an MRI. Dayton Foods denied those requests.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">{\u00b6 4} On June 19, 2001, Unger was examined by Dr. Wayne C. Woodard. Dr. Woodard also suspected a rotator-cuff injury and recommended an MRI. He also believed that Unger had not reached MMI.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">{\u00b6 5} On June 28, 2001, appellee Industrial Commission of Ohio held a hearing. Authorization for an MRI followed those proceedings, and the procedure was performed on August 14, 2001. The administering doctor concluded:</p>\n<p id=\"b378-10\">{\u00b6 6} \u201cA small subchondral cyst is seen in the posterior humeral head. No bone marrow edema is seen to suggest bone contusion or fracture. No significant joint effusion is noted. A type I acromion process is present. No significant left acromioclavicular joint hypertrophy is seen. The tendon of the long head of the biceps muscle is in its expected location, in the bicipital groove. The glenoid labrum is grossly intact. No rotator cuff tear is identified. There is a 9.0 x 7.0 x 5.0 millimeter object noted along the anterior aspect of the humeral head, the signal characteristics of which follow those of bone, possibly representing a loose body.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b378-11\">{\u00b6 7} On October 18, 2001, the administering doctor submitted this addendum to the MRI report:</p>\n<p id=\"b378-12\">{\u00b6 8} \u201cI have been asked by Dr. Paley to review this examination with specific attention to the possibility of rotator cuff tendonitis rather than a tear. On further review of the examination, there is some minimal low-grade signal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"301\">*301</page-number>abnormality seen in the mid-fibers of the supraspinatus tendon consistent with tendonosis. This could represent mild tendonitis or tendon degeneration.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">{\u00b6 9} This addendum later triggered Dayton Foods\u2019 assertion that Dr. Paley had pressured the MRI radiologist into finding some evidence of rotator-cuff injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">{\u00b6 10} Dr. Paley\u2019s office notes from autumn 2001 recommend an arthroscopic evaluation of the shoulder, a surgical decompression, and removal of the loose body shown on the MRI. On October 29, 2001, Dr. Paley asked Dayton Foods to authorize these procedures.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-7\">{\u00b6 11} In response, Dayton Foods had Unger examined by Dr. Steven Wunder on November 6, 2001. Dr. Wunder believed that surgery was unnecessary, writing:</p>\n<p id=\"b379-8\">{\u00b6 12} \u201cIt is my understanding this claim has been recognized and allowed for a left shoulder strain, left shoulder rotator cuff tendonitis, and left shoulder rotator cuff tear. I believe these conditions from the industrial injury have resolved. The MRI scan was unremarkable for a rotator cuff tear. There was no evidence of impingement on the MRI, and there was a type I acromion and no AC joint hypertrophy. Furthermore, I do not believe that the loose body was related to the industrial injury. Quite clearly, there was no evidence of a bone contusion, fracture or joint effusion to suggest trauma as the cause of the loose body.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b379-9\">{\u00b6 13} From that point, dueling medical reports came to the forefront. On December 21, Dr. Paley responded to Dr. Wunder\u2019s report:</p>\n<p id=\"b379-10\">{\u00b6 14} \u201cIn reviewing Dr. Wunder\u2019s medical report, I do not follow his line of reasoning. Dr. Wunder accurately describes the history of the injury as well as the subsequent care. On the evaluation by Dr. Wunder, Mr. Unger clearly continues to be quite symptomatic. According to Dr. Wunder\u2019s physical examination, Mr. Unger has rotator cuff impingement signs. He also has painful range of motion of the left shoulder. Dr. Wunder does not adequately assess the integrity of the rotator cuff with resisted testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-11\">{\u00b6 15} \u201cIt is obvious based on the examination by Dr. Wunder that Mr. Unger continues to be quite symptomatic with evidence clinically of rotator cuff tendonitis. This corresponds well with the MRI findings that were previously obtained on Mr. Unger\u2019s left shoulder. His examination also corresponds well with multiple other physical examinations including that of myself and Dr. Woodard who like myself is a Board Certified Orthopedic Surgeon with great expertise in the examination of shoulder injuries. I do not understand how Dr. Wunder can state that Mr. Unger\u2019s conditions from the industrial injury have resolved when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"302\">*302</page-number>he has such continued clinical findings of left shoulder pain, weakness, and impingement signs.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cI also take exception with Dr. Wunder\u2019s assessment that the MRI does not show any evidence of a bone contusion, joint effusion, or evidence of acute trauma. The MRI was obtained on August 14, 2001, which is approximately 14 months after the injury. Anybody with any reasonable medical training should know that an MRI obtained 14 months after an acute injury will not show acute evidence of an injury to the bone such as a bone contusion, fracture, or joint effusion. Mr. Unger was found to have a large loose body within the shoulder joint on the MRI of August 14, 2001. Individuals do not just have loose bodies within the shoulder. A specific injury must occur to cause a loose body to form. Mr. Unger has no past history of problems with the left shoulder prior to the accident of June 7, 2000. The mechanism of injury of a large shipping cabinet falling on him could, in my opinion, be the source of this loose body in addition to the injury to the rotator cuff.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-7\">{\u00b6 18} \u201cI am quite concerned, having reviewed many of Dr. Wunder\u2019s independent medical examinations over the year, about the accuracy of his assessment with regard to the injured worker. I have not had the pleasure of reviewing an independent medical examination by Dr. Wunder where he does not come to the conclusion where the patient has reached maximum medical improvement. Mr. Unger categorically has not reached maximum medical improvement because he continues to be quite symptomatic and has not completed care. He has failed extensive conservative treatment and requires a surgical procedure in order to be maximally medically improved. Dr. Wunder\u2019s own physical examination findings support this conclusion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b380-8\">{\u00b6 19} Dr. Wunder answered on February 5, 2002:</p>\n<p id=\"b380-9\">{\u00b6 20} \u201cDr. Paley appears to express hostility towards anyone that disagrees with his opinions. Relative to Mr. Unger or any other workers\u2019 compensation claimant that I see, we try to follow evidence-based medicine. The physicians that saw him at or near the time of injury felt that his condition was coming from the cervical spine. There was no rotator cuff tear noted on his MRI. Dr. Paley apparently requested the radiologist to re-read the MRI and they [sic] indicated that there was only a minimum low-grade signal abnormality in the mid fibers of the supraspinatus tendon compatible with tendinosis or degeneration. This is not an unusual finding in a 47-year-old male and would not be considered traumatic. His MRI scan showed no evidence of impingement nor did it document a rotator cuff tear.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-10\">{\u00b6 21} \u201cMy opinion is unchanged after reviewing Dr. Paley\u2019s December 21, 2001, report. The rotator cuff was intact with resisted testing. Dr. Paley <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"303\">*303</page-number>obviously did not read my report as I noted normal strength around the shoulder girdle region on several occasions. He indicated surgery was needed so that he could return to work and be a productive member of society. He has been able to continue to work. In fact he worked for a year until he saw Dr. Paley.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cI don\u2019t believe an arthroscopic exploration would be indicated or necessary for the patient\u2019s industrial injury. A subacromial decompression would not be indicated or necessary for the allowed conditions or his industrial injury.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">{\u00b6 23} On March 8, 2002, Dr. Paley followed up:</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cI have reviewed for a second time Dr. Wunder\u2019s physical examination and conclusions on Mr. Unger dated November 6, 2001. Within his physical examination Dr. Wunder does indicate that there are impingement signs about Mr. Unger\u2019s left shoulder. He also states that he has pain with resisted strength testing about the left shoulder. Both of these are indicative of an injury to the rotator cuff. I do not see how Dr. Wunder can, therefore, conclude that the patient has a normal rotator cuff.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-7\">{\u00b6 25} \u201cIt is still my opinion as a Board certified orthopedic surgeon with Fellowship training in shoulder surgery that Mr. Unger has an injury to the rotator cuff consisting of left shoulder rotator cuff tendonitis. This was seen on the MRI. This should not be considered age-related changes as discussed in Dr. Wunder\u2019s letter. Certainly MRI findings in conjunction with clinical findings seen on Mr. Unger\u2019s examination should lead to the conclusion that Mr. Unger has sustained an injury to the rotator cuff and requires the previously-requested surgery.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-8\">{\u00b6 26} \u201cI would like you to know that I have no hostility towards Dr. Wunder as alluded to in his letter. I am, however, obligated to be my patient\u2019s advocate; and I do not appreciate the significant delay in treatment for Mr. Unger based on what I feel are inaccurate conclusions by Dr. Wunder.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b381-9\">{\u00b6 27} Dayton Foods had by this time denied surgical-treatment authorization, prompting Unger to move the commission for a hearing. The procedural course before the commission and court of appeals will be set forth shortly.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-10\">\n<em>The TTC Controversy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b381-11\">{\u00b6 28} While Dr. Paley was attempting to secure approval for an MRI, Unger was receiving TTC. On April 26, 2001, Unger submitted a C-84 form on which Dr. Paley had certified that Unger\u2019s temporary total disability would last through June 26, 2001. The next day, Dayton Foods faxed a letter to the doctor:</p>\n<p id=\"b381-12\">{\u00b6 29} \u201cThis letter is in response to the disability slip that Joseph Unger submitted on April 26, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"304\">*304</page-number>{\u00b6 30} \u201cWe have an aggressive return to work policy and actively attempt to return individuals to work within the work restrictions placed upon them. It is our belief that this policy is in the best interest of the employee as it allows them to return to work that is within their restrictions without losing any compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">{\u00b6 31} \u201cAs such, we are requesting that you complete and return the attached Attending Physician Report as soon as possible.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">{\u00b6 32} \u201cI believe we have a great opportunity to return Joseph to work, when considering he is in a manager\u2019s position and we have many options to consider in adapting any restrictions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">{\u00b6 33} Just seven days later, on May 3, 2001, Dayton Foods sent a second fax:</p>\n<p id=\"b382-8\">{\u00b6 34} \u201cI am sending you this letter to once again request that you complete the Attending Physician Report for Joseph Unger that was faxed to you on April 27, 2001 * * *. Your delay in responding to this request is directly impacting Mr. Unger\u2019s compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-9\">{\u00b6 35} \u201cI want to again emphasize that we have an aggressive return to work policy and actively attempt to return individuals to work within the work restrictions placed upon them. It is our belief that this policy is in the best interest of the employee as it allows them to return to work that is within their restrictions without losing any compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-10\">{\u00b6 36} \u201cWhen you take into consideration that his allowed condition and/or your request for additional conditions, all involve his left shoulder, I am certain that Mr. Unger can return to work as a manager with restrictions that allow for these conditions.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-11\">{\u00b6 37} On May 7, 2001, Dr. Paley faxed two documents to Dayton Foods. The first was a copy of Dayton Foods\u2019 May 3rd fax, upon which Dr. Paley had written the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b382-12\">{\u00b6 38} \u201cYou are the one delaying compensation and treatment for Mr. Unger\u2014 NOT ME. Kindly approve the previously requested treatment plan. Mr. Unger probably would have returned to work by now <em>if you would approve treatment.\u201d </em>(Emphasis sic.)</p>\n<p id=\"b382-13\">{\u00b6 39} The second document was the completed \u201cAttending Physician\u2019s Report of Injury/Status\u201d that Dayton Foods had requested. It restricted Unger to sedentary work but also contained the notation \u201coff work through 6/26 until treatment approved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b382-14\">{\u00b6 40} Dayton Foods responded the next day:</p>\n<p id=\"b382-15\">{\u00b6 41} \u201cThis letter is in response to your fax of May 7, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"305\">*305</page-number>{\u00b6 42} <em>\u201cFirst, </em>we are not denying treatment to Mr. Unger. The treatment that you are referring to can proceed and be submitted for approval through our medical insurance plan, Anthem.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">{\u00b6 43} \u201cAt this time, further treatment under the workers\u2019 compensation claim cannot be approved. This is based on the determination that Mr. Unger was at maximum medical improvement as of the independent medical examination of December 7, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">{\u00b6 44} <em>\u201cSecond, </em>Mr. Unger can return to work as the Bakery Manager under the restrictions you placed on the Attending Physician\u2019s Report, faxed on May 7, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-8\">{\u00b6 45} \u201cThis work would require him to sit at his desk working with his computer. His job duties while at his desk would consist of:</p>\n<p id=\"b383-9\">{\u00b6 46} \u201c1. Completion of the action plan projects given to him on April 26, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-10\">{\u00b6 47} \u201c2. He would also be responsible for completing the weekly work schedules of all the bakery employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-11\">{\u00b6 48} \u201c3. He would also be responsible for scheduling all store orders in the production schedule per order delivery requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-12\">{\u00b6 49} \u201cHe would also need to attend management meetings as scheduled.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-13\">{\u00b6 50} \u201cThese job requirements comply with all the restrictions that you indicated on the 5/7/01 report. The company will comply and will require Mr. Unger to comply with the restrictions contained within the 5/7/01 report.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-14\">{\u00b6 51} \u201cPlease respond back to me by Friday, May 11, 2001, indicating your acceptance of the job modifications as outlined above.\u201d (Emphasis sic.)</p>\n<p id=\"b383-15\">{\u00b6 52} There is no evidence that Dr. Paley responded to this letter.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-16\">{\u00b6 53} Unger saw Dr. Paley on May 24. Dr. Paley\u2019s notes from that visit indicate the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b383-17\">{\u00b6 54} \u201cThe patient continues to require an arthroscopic subacromial decompression. The patient\u2019s caseworker refuses to allow an MRI of the shoulder. I will submit another request for the arthroscopic subacromial decompression and hopefully with the independent medical examination findings we can proceed with appropriate treatment for the patient. The patient cannot work at this time due to his symptoms and I will extend his disability through June 26, 2001. I am quite frustrated with the delay inappropriate [sic] treatment for this patient. The patient could have return[ed] to work at this time if his treatment had been approved [in] a timely fashion. I will reassess the patient in three weeks time.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b383-18\">{\u00b6 55} That same day, Dr. Paley wrote to Dayton Foods:</p>\n<p id=\"b383-19\">{\u00b6 56} \u201cI\u2019ve had the pleasure of evaluating Mr. Joseph Unger for his injured left shoulder. He continues to be symptomatic and requires an arthroscopic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"306\">*306</page-number>subacromial decompression of the shoulder. As you know, numerous attempts have been made to proceed with an MRI of the shoulder in order to amend his claim to the correct diagnosis of left shoulder rotator cuff tendinitis. To date, all request[s] have been denied. Until appropriate treatment is allowed for Mr. Unger I will keep him off work. He is not able to perform light-duty of any kind. Kindly approv[e] treatment for Mr. Unger. As I previously discussed with you, Mr. Unger could have returned] to work full duty if his treatment plan had not unnecessarily been delayed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">{\u00b6 57} Despite Dr. Paley\u2019s indication that he would not release Unger to work until an MRI and other treatment was authorized, Dayton Foods focused on Dr. Paley\u2019s April 26, 2001 C-84 form that listed an estimated return-to-work date of June 26, 2001. Unger \u2014 following Dr. Paley\u2019s instructions \u2014 did not return to work on that date, and Dayton Foods sent the following letter to him the next day:</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">{\u00b6 58} \u201cThis letter is to notify you that you have failed to return to work after a leave of absence (return to work date of June 27, 2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">{\u00b6 59} \u201cCompany policy states that failure to return to work after a leave of absence is considered a voluntary quit.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-8\">{\u00b6 60} \u201cAlso, company policy states that being absent without reporting for three (3) consecutive workdays is considered an automatic quit.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-9\">{\u00b6 61} \u201cYou must contact me by 8 AM, Eastern Standard Time, Friday, June 29th, 2001, or you will be subject to these policies.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b384-10\">{\u00b6 62} Unger was not terminated on the 29th. Perhaps the reason was that a commission hearing was held the previous day, at which an MRI was authorized based on Dr. Paley\u2019s reports and reports by Dr. Woodard, who concurred in Dr. Paley\u2019s findings.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-11\">{\u00b6 63} On July 6, 2001 \u2014 before Unger had had an MRI \u2014 a Dayton Foods representative sent another letter to Dr. Paley:</p>\n<p id=\"b384-12\">{\u00b6 64} \u201cI am sending you this letter per the results of the hearing of June 28, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-13\">{\u00b6 65} <em>\u201cFirst, </em>the request for the MRI is approved. * * *</p>\n<p id=\"b384-14\">{\u00b6 66} <em>\u201cSecond, </em>the offer to return Mr. Unger to work as the Bakery Manager per the restrictions you placed on the Attending Physician\u2019s Report, faxed on May 7, 2001 is still available.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-15\">{\u00b6 67} \u201cAgain, this work would require him to sit at his desk working with his computer. His job duties while at his desk would consist of:</p>\n<p id=\"b384-16\">{\u00b6 68} \u201c1. Completion of the action plan projects given to him on April 24, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"307\">*307</page-number>{\u00b6 69} \u201c2. He would also be responsible for completing the weekly work schedules of all of the bakery employees.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">{\u00b6 70} \u201c3. He would also be responsible for scheduling all store orders in the production schedule per order delivery requirements.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">{\u00b6 71} \u201cHe would also need to attend management meetings as scheduled.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">{\u00b6 72} \u201cThese job requirements comply with all of the restrictions that you indicated on the 5/7/01 report. The company will comply and will require Mr. Unger to comply with the restrictions contained within the 5/7/01 report.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">{\u00b6 73} \u201cIf Mr. Unger\u2019s restrictions have changed, please forward the new restrictions to me as soon as possible. I have attached a new Attending Physician\u2019s Report for your convenience if it is needed.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-8\">{\u00b6 74} \u201cI want to again emphasize that we have an aggressive return to work policy and actively attempt to return individuals to work within the work restrictions placed upon them.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-9\">{\u00b6 75} \u201cYour help in this matter is deeply appreciated. Please respond by Friday, July 13, 2001.\u201d (Emphasis sic.)</p>\n<p id=\"b385-10\">{\u00b6 76} It is unclear whether Unger was receiving TTC at the time Dayton Foods sent this letter, and it is also unclear whether Unger knew that he still had a job to return to after Dayton Foods\u2019 June 29, 2001 deadline had passed. In any event, by July 11, 2001, he was living in another state. On July 11, 2001, he reported to Dr. Paley for reevaluation. Office notes from that visit reflect the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b385-11\">{\u00b6 77} \u201cHISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Joseph is here for evaluation of his left shoulder. He has been approved for a left shoulder MRI. He is currently living in St. Louis, Missouri due to his financial situation. He continues to be symptomatic with complaints of left shoulder pain. He is unable to relocate back to Dayton at this time because of his financial situation. He is currently living with family. He has not received any disability or back pay.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-12\">{\u00b6 78} \u201cPHYSICAL EXAMINATION: Examination shows good shoulder range of motion but pain at the extremes. He has positive impingement signs. He has moderate rotator cuff weakness. He is neurologically intact in the upper extremity and cervical neck examination was unremarkable. He has no instability about the shoulder. There is no evidence of infection. There is no tenderness about the acromioclavicular joint biceps tendon.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-13\">{\u00b6 79} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b385-14\">{\u00b6 80} \u201cDISPOSITION AND PLAN: I would like to proceed with MRI of the left shoulder. At this time Joseph is unable to return to work at his former place of employment in Dayton, Ohio due to his financial situation. I would like to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"308\">*308</page-number>reassess the patient in three weeks time after the MRI when he will be back in town.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">{\u00b6 81} Dayton Foods apparently read those notes to mean that Dr. Paley was attributing Unger\u2019s inability to work to Unger\u2019s relocation, rather than his injury. Dayton Foods sent claimant this letter:</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">{\u00b6 82} \u201cBased upon Dr. Paley\u2019s office notes of July 11th, 2001, you are required to report to work and perform the duties of Bakery Director.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">{\u00b6 83} \u201cIt is clear from Dr. Paley\u2019s office notes that you are now physically able to perform the duties of Bakery Director, as outlined in the May 8, 2001 letter to yourself and Dr. Paley.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-8\">{\u00b6 84} \u201cJoe, if you do not return to work by 8 AM on Monday, August 6th, 2001, then it shall be determined that you voluntarily quit your position and your employment will be terminated.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b386-9\">{\u00b6 85} Unger did not respond, and on August 8, Dayton Foods made good on its threat to terminate his employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-10\">\n<em>Commission and Court of Appeals Proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b386-11\">{\u00b6 86} On July 23, 2001, Dayton Foods moved to terminate TTC \u201cdue to the treating physician\u2019s failure to respond to light duty job offer.\u201d A district hearing officer (\u201cDHO\u201d) denied Dayton Foods\u2019 motion on October 10, 2001:</p>\n<p id=\"b386-12\">{\u00b6 87} \u201cThe employer argued that temporary total disability compensation should be terminated because the physician of record had not responded to the employer\u2019s request to certify light duty employment. The employer further argued that the claimant voluntarily terminated his employment on 08/06/2001 and that the claimant is currently receiving treatment for unallowed conditions.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-13\">{\u00b6 88} \u201cThe physician of record\u2019s failure to adequately respond to the self-insured employer does not constitute a basis to terminate temporary total disability compensation. The District Hearing Officer notes that Dr. Paley, the physician of record, stated that claimant could not perform any work until an MRI is performed. An MRI was not obtained until 08/14/2001. The District Hearing Officer further notes that on C-84s dated 06/14/2001 and 08/12/2001 Dr. Paley indicated that claimant could not perform any light duty employment. Thus, even though the employer may be able to adhere to any medical restrictions, there is simply no evidence from a medical provider that the claimant can return to such work.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-14\">{\u00b6 89} \u201cNext, the employer argued that they offered employment to the claimant on 07/26/2001 and that claimant\u2019s failure to respond resulted in his voluntary termination on 08/06/2001. The District Hearing Officer disagrees. Again, the medical documentation does not indicate that the claimant can return <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"309\">*309</page-number>to restricted work. As such, the claimant\u2019s absence from the work force is not voluntary, but due to the allowed conditions in the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">{\u00b6 90} \u201cFinally, the employer argued that claimant is receiving treatment for conditions not allowed in the claim. The medical documentation that the employer apparently relies upon was not supplied to the claim. The District Hearing Officer has no medical documentation to make such a conclusion. Neither the 08/14/2001 MRI nor any office notes from Dr. Paley beyond 07/11/2001 are on file.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-5\">{\u00b6 91} \u201cAccordingly, the District Hearing Officer orders the continued payment of temporary total disability compensation upon the further submission of appropriate medical evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-6\">{\u00b6 92} A staff hearing officer (\u201cSHO\u201d) affirmed the DHO\u2019s ruling after a November 30, 2001 hearing, with the following entry:</p>\n<p id=\"b387-7\">{\u00b6 93} \u201cThe employer\u2019s C-86 filed 07/25/2001 is denied. It is the finding of the Staff Hearing Officer that [Dr. Paley\u2019s] failure to respond to the employer\u2019s light duty job offer does not constitute a basis for termination of the claimant\u2019s temporary total disability compensation benefits, especially when medical evidence on file continues to clearly document the continued temporary disability of the claimant due to the 06/07/2000 industrial injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">{\u00b6 94} \u201cThis order is based upon the medical reports of Dr. Paley 04/26/2001, 07/11/2001, 06/14/2001, 08/12/2001, and the evidence adduced at the hearing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b387-9\">{\u00b6 95} Dayton Foods appealed. While that matter was pending, two more motions were filed: Unger moved for surgical-treatment authorization, and Dayton Foods filed another motion to terminate TCC, this time asserting MMI. This motion to terminate was based on the November 6, 2001 report by Dr. Wunder discussed earlier.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-10\">{\u00b6 96} On January 25, 2002, the commission refused to consider Dayton Foods\u2019 appeal of the SHO order denying Dayton Foods\u2019 first motion to terminate. On April 19, a DHO ruled on Unger\u2019s motion for authorization of surgery and Dayton Foods\u2019 motion to terminate TCC based on MMI. Relying on Dr. Wunder\u2019s February 5, 2002 and November 6, 2001 reports, respectively, the DHO denied surgical-treatment authorization and granted Dayton Foods\u2019 motion to terminate TTC.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-11\">{\u00b6 97} An SHO reversed both findings, relying on Dr. Paley\u2019s findings:</p>\n<p id=\"b387-12\">{\u00b6 98} \u201cIt is the finding of the Staff Hearing Officer that the claimant\u2019s request for authorization for further treatment with Dr. Paley and for orthoscopic [sic] surgery is granted. The Staff Hearing Officer finds the reports of Dr. Paley, dated 12/21/01 and 3/8/02 to be persuasive in both the claimant\u2019s need for surgery and its causal relationship to the 6/7/00 industrial injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"310\">*310</page-number>{\u00b6 99} \u201cTemporary total disability compensation is to continue from the date of last payment to 7/4/02, based on the C-84 from Dr. Paley dated 2/11/02 and 4/30/02.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">{\u00b6 100} Dayton Foods\u2019 appeal of the SHO\u2019s order was refused, and Dayton Foods initiated an action in mandamus in the Court of Appeals for Franklin County. The court of appeals held that Dr. Paley\u2019s December 21, 2001 report was \u201csome evidence\u201d relating the loose body in Unger\u2019s shoulder to his industrial injury and that the commission, therefore, did not abuse its discretion in authorizing the operation.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">{\u00b6 101} Addressing TTC, the court relied on R.C. 4123.56(A) and Ohio Adm. Code 4121-3-32(A) and stressed that it is a <em>claimant\u2019s </em>refusal of an offer of suitable employment, not a doctor\u2019s, that is needed to satisfy the statute\u2019s termination criteria. It also rejected Dayton Foods\u2019 assertion that Dr. Paley\u2019s C-84 forms were flawed because they prospectively certified temporary total disability.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-7\">{\u00b6 102} This cause is now before this court on an appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-8\">{\u00b6 103} Dayton Foods\u2019 objection to surgery has been the same throughout\u2014 lack of causal relationship between the need for surgery and the industrial injury. Its challenge to TTC, on the other hand, has alternated between three different theories. The court of appeals, through its magistrate, has done an exemplary job assembling the relevant facts and addressing the arguments accurately and succinctly. We affirm its judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-9\">{\u00b6 104} On the issue of surgery, Dayton Foods implies that Dr. Paley is being deceptive. It accuses the doctor of requesting surgery for an allowed condition\u2014 tendonitis \u2014 when he really seeks to repair a nonallowed condition \u2014 a loose body in Unger\u2019s shoulder. This argument ignores the SHO\u2019s conclusion that the need for surgery \u2014 even if a loose body is involved \u2014 is related to the industrial injury. Dr. Paley\u2019s December 21, 2001 report states:</p>\n<p id=\"b388-10\">{\u00b6 105} \u201cMr. Unger was found to have a large loose body within the shoulder joint on the MRI of August 14, 2001. Individuals do not just have loose bodies within the shoulder. A specific injury must occur to cause a loose body to form. Mr. Unger has no past history of problems with the left shoulder prior to the accident of June 7, 2000. The mechanism of injury of a large shipping cabinet falling on him could, in my opinion, be the source of this loose body in addition to the injury to the rotator cuff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b388-11\">{\u00b6 106} This contradicts Dayton Foods\u2019 assertion that there is no evidence causally relating the loose body to the industrial injury. Accordingly, its argument is rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"Ag5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>{\u00b6 107} Turning to TTC, Dayton Foods accuses Dr. Paley of being uncooperative in Dayton Foods\u2019 efforts to return Unger to light-duty work and claims that under R.C. 4123.56(A) this warrants termination of TCC. This proposition fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">{\u00b6 108} R.C. 4123.56(A) provides that TTC payments \u201cshall not be made for the period when any employee has returned to work, when an employee\u2019s treating physician has made a written statement that the employee is capable of returning to the employee\u2019s former position of employment, when work within the physical capabilities of the employee is made available by the employer or another employer, or when the employee has reached the maximum medical improvement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">{\u00b6 109} Ohio Adm.Code 4121-3-32(B)(2)(d) supplements the statute, allowing termination \u201c[u]pon the finding of a district hearing officer that the employee has received a written job offer of suitable employment.\u201d \u201cSuitable employment\u201d is \u201cwork which is within the employee\u2019s physical capabilities.\u201d Ohio Adm.Code 4121-3-32(A)(3). \u201cJob offer\u201d is a \u201cproposal, made in good faith, of suitable employment within a reasonable proximity of the injured worker\u2019s residence.\u201d Ohio Adm.Code 4121-3-32(A)(6).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">{\u00b6 110} Dayton Foods never extended a light-duty job offer to Unger, nor did it seek termination for his failure to accept such an offer, rendering Ohio Adm.Code 4121-3-32(B)(2)(d) inapplicable. It instead maintains that it was foreclosed from extending a job offer by Dr. Paley\u2019s failure to respond to its proposed light-duty position. This assertion has three flaws.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-9\">{\u00b6 111} First, neither the Revised Code nor the Administrative Code lists a <em>doctor\u2019s </em>response to a proposed job offer as a termination criterion. Second, Dayton Foods\u2019 description of Dr. Paley as unresponsive is tenuous. On April 26, 2001, Unger submitted to Dayton Foods a C-84 form in which Dr. Paley prohibited Unger from working through June 26. Dayton Foods refused to accept that medical opinion and instead faxed Dr. Paley a form asking him to list Unger\u2019s medical restrictions. When Dr. Paley did not respond within one week, Dayton Foods again faxed the request. This time, Dr. Paley indicated that Unger could do sedentary work but also wrote that Unger was \u201coff work through 6/26 until treatment approved.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b389-10\">{\u00b6 112} Dayton Foods seized upon the possibility of sedentary work and immediately wrote to the doctor and informed him that in the opinion of the Human Resources Director, Unger was medically capable of the light-duty job that Dayton Foods had proposed. Notwithstanding Dr. Paley\u2019s C-84 form and the handwritten notation, Dayton Foods requested that Dr. Paley \u2014 within the next three days \u2014 accept the Human Resources Director\u2019s medical assessment and release Unger to the light-duty job. Dr. Paley, understandably, did not answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>{\u00b6 113} Contrary to Dayton Foods\u2019 representation, Dr. Paley answered Dayton Foods\u2019 requests promptly. He simply refused to allow himself to be bullied into forcing Unger back to work prematurely. Again, Dr. Paley had stated from the beginning that Unger was medically incapable of any work through June 26. The alleged factual basis for Dayton Foods\u2019 legal position does not, therefore, withstand scrutiny.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">{\u00b6 114} Third, Dayton Foods\u2019 position would penalize Unger, by terminating his TTC, for a dispute over which he has no control. The quarrel here is between Dr. Paley and Dayton Foods. Unger should not be put in the crossfire merely because he heeded his doctor\u2019s instructions.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">{\u00b6 115} Last, Dayton Foods mounts a technical challenge to Dr. Paley\u2019s C-84 forms, criticizing his prospective certification of disability. C-84 forms, of course, are designed to accommodate prospective certification and are often used this way, particularly where TTC is ongoing.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">{\u00b6 116} Dayton Foods\u2019 complaint appears to be with Dr. Paley\u2019s practice of certifying disability for a two-month period, with a doctor\u2019s examination scheduled in the middle. For example, Dr. Paley saw Unger on April 16, 2001. He prepared the C-84 form on April 26, reporting that Unger was unable to work from that date through June 26. The C-84 form also indicated that Unger\u2019s next scheduled appointment was May 16. Dayton Foods apparently believes that the disability should only have been certified through May 15 with any disability finding thereafter contingent on the results of the May 16 visit.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-8\">{\u00b6 117} Dayton Foods\u2019 plan, however, could interrupt what should be continuous compensation. Using the dates in the example, Dayton Foods\u2019 proposed method would allow Dr. Paley to verify disability only through May 15. Then, presumably after the May 16 exam, the doctor \u2014 if Unger was still disabled\u2014 would file a new C-84 form extending the date of disability. Unfortunately, this scheme does not factor in form-preparation and processing time, which could result in a break in compensation. This explains why many doctors do exactly as Dr. Paley does: estimate a period of disability and schedule an interim visit to estimate further extension. Dayton Foods has cited no legal authority to support changing this traditional method of completing C-84 forms. We therefore decline Dayton Foods\u2019 invitation to change it.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-9\">{\u00b6 118} We affirm the judgment of the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-10\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b390-11\">Moyer, C.J., Resnicic, F.E.
