On October 7, 2002, relator, Northwestern Ohio Bar Association, filed a six-count complaint charging respondent with violations of the Code of Professional Responsibility. Respondent was served with the complaint but did not answer, and relator moved for default. See Gov.Bar R. V(6)(F).</p>\n<p id=\"b199-12\">{\u00b6 2} The Board of Commissioners on Grievances and Discipline referred the motion to a master commissioner. The master commissioner granted the motion for default and prepared a report for the board\u2019s review. The board adopted the master commissioner\u2019s findings that respondent had violated DR 6-101(A)(3) (barring an attorney from neglecting an entrusted legal matter) in connection with six counts of misconduct and recommended that respondent be indefinitely suspended from the practice of law in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-13\">{\u00b6 3} The board\u2019s findings of misconduct were based on an investigator\u2019s sworn statement that he had conducted an investigation of the charges against respondent and knew the charges to be true insofar as the motion for default alleged. We do not find this summary, conclusory, and hearsay-filled affidavit of sufficient weight or probative force to constitute the \u201c[s]worn or certified documentary prima facie evidence\u201d that Gov.Bar R. V(6)(F)(l)(b) requires to sustain a motion for default. Correspondingly, this affidavit is not sufficient to sustain relator\u2019s burden of proving respondent\u2019s alleged violations of DR 6-101(A)(3) by clear and convincing evidence. See Gov.Bar R. V(6)(J) and <em>Ohio State Bar Assn. v. Reid </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 327, 331, 708 N.E.2d 193.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-14\">{\u00b6 4} Thus, pursuant to our independent review in cases of professional misconduct, <em>Reid </em>at paragraph one of the syllabus, we return this cause to the board for further proceedings and findings consistent with our order, including <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"122\">*122</page-number>the submission and consideration of evidence that directly establishes the charges of respondent\u2019s misconduct.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AMDv\">James P.
