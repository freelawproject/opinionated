The common pleas court sentenced him to prison.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-14\">{\u00b6 2} In June 2004, Maxwell filed a petition in the Court of Appeals for Summit County for a writ of mandamus to compel appellee, Judge Mary F. Spicer of the common pleas court, to vacate his sentence and resentence him in accordance with applicable law. Maxwell claimed that Judge Spicer did not make the findings required by <em>State v. Comer, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 463, 2003-Ohio-4165, 793 N.E.2d 473, paragraphs one and two of the syllabus. Judge Spicer moved to dismiss the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-15\">{\u00b6 3} On July 29, 2004, the court of appeals granted Judge Spicer\u2019s motion and dismissed Maxwell\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-16\">{\u00b6 4} This cause is now before the court upon Maxwell\u2019s appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b422-17\">{\u00b6 5} We affirm the judgment of the court of appeals. Maxwell is not entitled to the retroactive application of <em>Comer </em>to his convictions, which had become final before <em>Comer </em>was decided. See <em>Ali v. State, </em>104 Ohio St.3d 328, 2004-Ohio-6592, 819 N.E.2d 687, \u00b6 6 and cases cited therein. Moreover, Maxwell waived the new claims he attempts to raise on appeal because he did not raise them in his petition or seek leave to amend his petition to include these claims. See <em>State ex rel. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number><em>Scruggs v. Sadler, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 160, 2004-Ohio-2054, 807 N.E.2d 357, \u00b6 6. Therefore, the court of appeals properly dismissed Maxwell\u2019s mandamus petition.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AFhr\">Thomas Maxwell, pro se.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AEl\">Sherri Bevan Walsh, Summit County Prosecuting Attorney, and Richard S.
