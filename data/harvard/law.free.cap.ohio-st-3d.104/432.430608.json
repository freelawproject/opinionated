The victim, 12-year-old \u201cJ,\u201d alleged that he and his twin brother, \u201cB,\u201d had shoveled snow at Crotts\u2019s residence on January 15. After Crotts paid the boys for shoveling snow, they attended an Awana church event with him. Following the event, they rented videos to watch at Crotts\u2019s home. The twins intended to spend the night there. After preparing dinner for the boys, Crotts fixed a plate for J, while B fixed his own plate. While the boys watched videos over dinner, Crotts also brought a glass of root beer into the living room for J to drink, while B poured his own. J and B reported that Crotts offered them a white pill, later determined to be melatonin, telling them it would help them sleep better and live longer. Both boys refused to ingest the pills, instead putting the pills in their pockets.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-11\">{\u00b6 2} B testified that J fell asleep unusually early that night. J recalled feeling woozy and falling asleep on the couch. He recalled being carried up the stairs at some point; he remembered seeing two white hands, Crotts\u2019s face, and a pair of glasses. J did not recall protesting. J believed that Crotts had somehow managed to slip him the white pill to make him drowsy.</p>\n<p id=\"b510-12\">{\u00b6 3} J woke up the next morning in Crotts\u2019s bedroom on top of Crotts. J was naked except for his socks. Crotts was also naked. J stated that when he awakened, he was facing the appellant in a \u201criding position\u201d and felt his penis rubbing against Crotts\u2019s penis. He felt Crotts\u2019s hands on his buttocks, moving him up and down. J also noted that both his penis and Crotts\u2019s penis were erect and lubricated with oil. J yelled at Crotts to get off him and attempted to climb off the bed. Crotts smiled and said to him, \u201cI know what you\u2019re doing,\u201d and grabbed J by the wrists. When J finally managed to get off the bed, he felt a wet substance in his pubic area. He put on his shorts and ran downstairs, where <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"433\">*433</page-number>he awakened his twin brother, yelling, \u201cSteve was trying to rape me \u2014 he was trying to do something to me.\u201d J called the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-5\">{\u00b6 4} The twins\u2019 older brother, 16-year-old P, worked for and resided with Crotts. P never paid rent to Crotts; while he was living there, Crotts took pictures of P and his friend in risque poses that Crotts printed with the captions \u201cC\u2019mon \u2018n\u2019 Lick Me\u201d and \u201cSisters for Life.\u201d P testified that he and a male friend returned to Crotts\u2019s home in the early morning hours of January 16, 1999 and saw his younger brother, B, sleeping on the couch alone. P and his friend went upstairs to go to sleep. They were awakened several hours later by sounds of a commotion in the house. Two officers came into his bedroom with their guns drawn. P heard J saying, \u201cNot in there, in here,\u201d and heard the shower running. P remained in his room until after Crotts was taken to the police station. He and his friend later left the residence at the order of the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-6\">{\u00b6 5} J and B were taken to the police station, where they were interviewed. J was then taken to the hospital and a rape-kit examination was performed. The examining doctor, Cary Scott, noted the presence of an emollient on J\u2019s body, which may have been olive oil. Dr. Scott noted no signs of trauma or physical evidence of molestation on the victim; however, Dr. Scott also noted that a lack of findings was not uncommon if a lubricant had been used or there was no forced penetration.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-7\">{\u00b6 6} The Bureau of Criminal Identification and Investigation (\u201cBCI\u201d) performed a chemical analysis of the white pill that B had turned over to police. Forensic scientist Jeffrey Houser determined that the white pill was melatonin, a dietary supplement. No tests were performed to determine whether melatonin had been ingested by J. The BCI report also contained the results of tests performed to find physical evidence on J\u2019s shorts. The report indicated the presence of sperm from J but found no evidence of sperm or DNA from Crotts.</p>\n<p id=\"b511-8\">{\u00b6 7} Crotts denied the allegations made against him. He asserted that he was awakened on the morning of January 16, 1999 by someone throwing shoes at him. He ignored it and tried to go back to sleep, but one of the twins \u2014 he couldn\u2019t tell which one \u2014 appeared at his bedside with a bottle of oil in his hand, poised to pour the oil on him. Crotts became angry and pushed the boy against the wall. The boy spilled the oil against the wall, further angering Crotts, and the boy ran out, still carrying the bottle. A few minutes later, one of the twins came into the room, tried to pull the sheet off Crotts, and again attempted to pour olive oil on him. Crotts grabbed the boy\u2019s arm, twisted it, and the boy fell to the ground. Crotts was naked at the time. He told the boy to give him the oil or he was going to \u201cbeat [him] like [his] father does.\u201d The boy ran downstairs, yelling that he was going to sue Crotts. Crotts stayed in bed a little longer and then got up <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"434\">*434</page-number>and took a shower. The next thing he knew, he heard police telling him to get out of the shower.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-4\">{\u00b6 8} Crotts was convicted of one count of kidnapping with a sexual-motivation specification and two counts of gross sexual imposition, with each of the latter two counts carrying a specification that the victim was under 13 years of age. Crotts was adjudicated to be a sexual predator.</p>\n<p id=\"b512-5\">{\u00b6 9} The appellate court reversed the convictions because it found certain testimony and evidence to be inadmissible \u201cother acts\u201d evidence. The evidence found offensive by the appellate court included (1) victim testimony that Crotts had photographs of nude juveniles and adults on his computer, (2) testimony that Crotts took the victim and his brother to an \u201call gay\u201d church, (3) testimony that Crotts attended a second church catering to the gay community, (4) a photograph of P and a male friend, which Crotts had captioned \u201cSisters for Life,\u201d (5) a second photograph, captioned \u201cC\u2019mon \u2018n\u2019 Lick Me!,\u201d of the same friend unclothed, partially covered by a sheet, and (6) testimony from P that he had \u201cpersonal experiences\u201d with Crotts that \u201cwould make [him] believe he\u2019s guilty * *</p>\n<p id=\"b512-6\">{\u00b6 10} We will begin by examining the admissibility of the first five items of evidence. The opinion testimony will be addressed separately. The state argues that the evidence listed in (1) through (5) above was properly admitted under Evid.R. 404(B) to demonstrate Crotts\u2019s intent, motive, and plan. The appellate court found that this evidence could not be used to show Crotts\u2019s intent because \u201cCrotts denied the acts, not their alleged purpose.\u201d The court reasoned, \u201c[I]f the State could prove the acts occurred as alleged, Crotts\u2019s intent would not be in dispute.\u201d The court also stated that the above-mentioned evidence, though purportedly offered to show intent, plan, or motive, actually goes solely to Crotts\u2019s propensity to commit the crime and was admitted in violation of Evid.R. 404(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b512-7\">{\u00b6 11} The appellate court dismissed the state\u2019s argument that the evidence shows Crotts\u2019s plan to desensitize the victim and his brothers to pedophilia in order to facilitate his sexual advances, opining, \u201cThe inference of a plan can be made only if one first infers that Crotts is homosexual, that he, therefore, is attracted to minors, and that he employed boys in his businesses as a means of gaining access to them. Not only are these inferences invalid, they can only be made after one has made the forbidden inference of propensity.\u201d (Footnote omitted.)</p>\n<p id=\"b512-8\">{\u00b6 12} We must note that the modern understanding of pedophilia is that it exists wholly independently from homosexuality. The existence or absence of one neither establishes nor disproves the other. \u201cThe belief that homosexuals are attracted to prepubescent children is a baseless stereotype.\u201d <em>State v. Bates </em>(Minn.App.1993), 507 N.W.2d 847, 852. Thus, evidence of homosexuality is not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"435\">*435</page-number>relevant to establish pedophilia. Id. We are forced to state the obvious because of the reckless and bald assertion by the appellate court that the prosecutor argued, and the jury believed, that because Crotts is homosexual, he therefore is also a pedophile. Fortunately, the appellate court is mistaken. Neither the prosecutor nor the trial judge was that obtuse. In fact, on the eve of trial, the trial judge warned the prosecution to be very careful in its treatment of the issue:</p>\n<p id=\"b513-4\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c[T]he State is to be very clear that [Crotts\u2019s] homosexuality cannot be used in a manner of prejudice against the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-5\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c* * * The Court may even on its own, step in if the Court feels that way and I will be watching for that.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-6\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c* * * I do want to severely caution [the prosecution] that this Court is not going to have homosexuality as the focus of the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-7\">{\u00b6 16} \u201cI\u2019m not going to allow the jurors to cast their verdict based on homosexuality.\u201d .</p>\n<p id=\"b513-8\">{\u00b6 17} The prosecutor did not argue that Crotts abused J because Crotts is homosexual. Rather, the prosecutor argued that over the course of time, Crotts attempted to condition J and his brothers to accept pedophilia as appropriate conduct. The state argues that the controverted evidence was used to support this legitimate argument. The question we must answer is whether the appellate court erred when it ruled that the trial court had abused its discretion by admitting the evidence to be used for this purpose.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-9\">{\u00b6 18} Generally, extrinsic acts may not be used to suggest that the accused has the propensity to act in a certain manner. Evid.R. 404(B); <em>State v. Smith </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 137, 140, 551 N.E.2d 190. However, there are exceptions. Evid.R. 404(B) allows such evidence where it is offered to show \u201cmotive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\u201d Even more relevant is R.C. 2945.59, which provides, \u201cIn any criminal case in which the defendant\u2019s motive or intent * * * is material, <em>any acts of the defendant </em>which tend to show his motive or intent, the absence of mistake or accident on his part, or the defendant\u2019s scheme, plan, or system in doing the act in question may be proved, whether they are contemporaneous with or prior or subsequent thereto, notwithstanding that such proof may show or tend to' show the commission of another crime by the defendant.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The defendant\u2019s motive in this case is absolutely material, as he was charged with kidnapping with a sexual-motivation specification.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-10\">{\u00b6 19} Neither R.C. 2945.59 nor Evid.R. 404(B) \u201crequires that the other act be \u2018like\u2019 or \u2018similar\u2019 to the crime charged, as long as the prior act tends to show one of the enumerated factors.\u201d <em>State v. Shedrick </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 331, 337, 574 N.E.2d 1065. The appellate court stated that proof of Crotts\u2019s plan is immaterial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>if the state establishes that the defendant committed the acts charged. While this statement is tautologically true, the standard for admitting other-acts evidence is not whether the evidence is necessary to prove an element of the offense. Rather, the issue is whether the evidence \u201ctend[s] to show\u201d motive, plan, or intent.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">{\u00b6 20} The appellate court\u2019s assertion that the state did not need to prove Crotts\u2019s motive, intent, scheme or plan to prove that he committed the charged offenses was misguided in several ways. First, it is not true in this case. In order to prove the sexual-motivation specification to the kidnapping count, the state needed to prove motivation. See R.C. 2971.01(J) and (K). Second, even if the statement were true, it does not follow that evidence establishing motive, intent, scheme, or plan is immaterial. Such evidence is always material because it tends to show why one version of events should be believed over another.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-5\">{\u00b6 21} In this case, the trial court aptly limited the evidence to protect the defendant. The trial court excluded from evidence any testimony regarding whether Crotts is homosexual or has AIDS. It also excluded testimony that Crotts walked around his house naked in the presence of juveniles and had a sexual relationship with P. The trial court excluded evidence that Crotts exposed J to pornography and sexual devices. The court severed this case from charges that Crotts sexually abused J\u2019s twin brother. The trial court also sustained an objection when the prosecutor asked P the meaning of \u201cSisters for' Life.\u201d Likewise, the court prevented P from testifying that he witnessed Crotts \u201clie[ ] about his health\u201d to a sexual partner, in the apparent belief that it would lead the jury to speculate about Crotts\u2019s HIV status. The photos of P and his friend were admitted only to show that Crotts was indeed sexually attracted to young boys. Even so, the court carefully limited this evidence that Crotts was attracted to minors out of concern that cumulative evidence of this nature would be prejudicial. J\u2019s testimony that he viewed child pornography on Crotts\u2019s computer is consistent with the state\u2019s desensitization theory of the case. The trial court\u2019s careful stewardship of this sensitive evidence demonstrated a skillful application of the evidentiary rules and fell well within her realm of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-6\">{\u00b6 22} The remaining controverted evidence took the form of witness testimony, which by its very nature cannot always be curtailed in advance. Two of the statements described Crotts\u2019s introduction of the boys to what one of them called an \u201call gay\u201d church and to a second church that was characterized as gay-friendly. The state offered this testimony as an element of its theory that Crotts exposed J to sex through photos, movies, casual nudity, and environment to desensitize him to man-boy sexual relationships. One of the environmental factors happened to be exposure to homosexuality. The trial court recognized that homosexuality does not equate with pedophilia. However, it also found that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"437\">*437</page-number>the state\u2019s theory was not unreasonable. Thus, the jury was permitted to weigh this evidence. Crotts argues that this statement prejudiced him by implying that he is homosexual, leading the jury to convict him based upon his homosexuality.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-5\">{\u00b6 23} As a legal term, \u201cprejudice\u201d is simply \u201c[djamage or detriment to one\u2019s legal rights or claims.\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (8th Ed.1999) 1218. Thus, it is fair to say that all relevant evidence is prejudicial. That is, evidence that tends to disprove a party\u2019s rendition of the facts necessarily harms that party\u2019s case. Accordingly, the rules of evidence do not attempt to bar all prejudicial evidence\u2014 to do so would make reaching any result extremely difficult. Rather, only evidence that is <em>unfairly </em>prejudicial is excludable.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-6\">{\u00b6 24} \u201c \u2018Exclusion on the basis of unfair prejudice involves more than a balance of mere prejudice. If unfair prejudice simply meant prejudice, anything adverse to a litigant\u2019s case would be excludable under Rule 403. Emphasis must be placed on the word \u201cunfair.\u201d Unfair prejudice is that quality of evidence which might result in an improper basis for a jury decision. Consequently, if the evidence arouses the jury\u2019s emotional sympathies, evokes a sense of horror, or appeals to an instinct to punish, the evidence may be unfairly prejudicial. Usually, although not always, unfairly prejudicial evidence appeals to the jury\u2019s emotions rather than intellect.\u2019 \u201d <em>Oberlin v. Akron Gen. Med. Ctr. </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 169, 172, 743 N.E.2d 890, quoting Weissenberger\u2019s Ohio Evidence (2000) 85-87, Section 403.3.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-7\">{\u00b6 25} Because fairness is subjective, the determination whether evidence is unfairly prejudicial is left to the sound discretion of the trial court and will be overturned only if the discretion is abused. <em>State v. Robb </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 59, 68, 723 N.E.2d 1019. The unfairness that the appellate court found here apparently was the danger that the jury would presume that Crotts was guilty if it learned that he is homosexual. Although we would be reluctant to overturn this ruling had it been made by the trial court, the court of appeals failed to articulate why the trial court acted outside its discretion when it concluded that the limited references to \u201call gay\u201d and gay-friendly churches was not prejudicial. The appellate court simply substituted its judgment for that of the trial court without demonstrating that the lower court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b515-8\">{\u00b6 26} The trial court granted Crotts\u2019s motion to exclude evidence that he is homosexual. No direct evidence that Crotts is gay was admitted. Testimony that Crotts took the children to allegedly homosexual churches does not lead so inexorably to the conclusion that he is homosexual that admission of such testimony was an abuse of discretion. Theoretically, testimony that a heterosexual male took children to a homosexual church would be more supportive of the state\u2019s theory that it was done for the purpose of desensitizing J because a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>straight male would have less reason to attend a gay church, and his motive for taking a child there would be that much more suspicious.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AIj\">William D. Mason, Cuyahoga County Prosecuting Attorney, Peter Corrigan, Faris Asad, Chrisana C. Blanco, and Amy E. Venesile, Assistant Prosecuting Attorneys, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AGv\">Paul Mancino Jr., for appellee.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b516-5\">{\u00b6 27} The final controverted testimony was that P testified during redirect, \u201cWell, I have had personal experiences with the defendant that would make me believe he\u2019s guilty, but I\u2019ve also known my brothers all their lives and heard their lies, so it\u2019s kind of a loseAose situation.\u201d In its opinion, the appellate court quoted only the first half of this statement. The qualification that follows the \u201cbut\u201d minimizes the effect of the first clause. It is not clear to us why the sentence, taken as a whole, should be excluded. Lay witness opinion testimony is permitted where it is \u201c(1) rationally based on the perception of the witness and (2) helpful to a clear understanding of his testimony or the determination of a fact in issue.\u201d Evid.R. 701. Opinion testimony is not excludable \u201csolely because it embraces an ultimate issue to be decided by the trier of fact.\u201d Evid.R. 704. This case was ultimately one of credibility. J told one version of events, and Crotts told another. Testimony expressing an opinion on whose version is more likely to be true would certainly aid the jury in reaching its conclusion. \u201cThe credibility of a witness may be attacked or supported by evidence in the form of opinion or reputation, but * * * the evidence may refer only to character for truthfulness or untruthfulness * * Evid.R. 608(A). P\u2019s testimony was directed to Crotts\u2019s character for untruthfulness. And since P portrayed his brothers as habitual liars virtually in the same breath, Crotts\u2019s claims of unfair prejudice must lose what little force they otherwise might have had.</p>\n<p id=\"b516-6\">{\u00b6 28} The court of appeals erred in reversing the conviction, and.its judgment is reversed.
