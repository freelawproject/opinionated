On or about April 12, inmates killed inmate Earl Elder. On April 15, inmates killed Robert Vallandingham, one of eight corrections officers taken hostage during the riot. On April 21, while inmates were surrendering and releasing the remaining hostages, inmates killed inmate David Sommers. Defendant-appellant, George Skatzes, was found guilty as one of the inmates responsible for the murders of Elder, Vallandingham, and Sommers and was sentenced to death.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-11\">{\u00b6 2} Sometime before April 11, 1993, the Ohio Department of Health mandated that all prison inmates in Ohio\u2019s prison system be tested for tuberculosis. The test required an injection. The Muslim inmates at SOCF, led by Carlos \u201cHasan\u201d Sanders, a leader of the Muslims at SOCF, objected to that form of testing on religious grounds. Word filtered down to the Muslims that a lockdown of SOCF was going to take place on Monday, the day after Easter Sunday, April 12, 1993, to facilitate the tuberculosis testing.</p>\n<p id=\"b273-12\">{\u00b6 3} On the evening before the riot, April 10, high-ranking members of the Aryan Brotherhood, including Jason Robb, Dewey Bocook, and Freddie Snyder, and the Muslims, including Sanders and James Were, met in the L block gym. Upon seeing this gathering, inmate Robert Brookover knew \u201cthere was something going on.\u201d Robb told fellow Aryan Brotherhood member Roger Snodgrass, \u201c[B]e on [your] toes tomorrow.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b273-13\">{\u00b6 4} On the afternoon of April 11, inmates took control of the entire L section of the prison, including cell blocks 1 through 8. Prison authorities attempted to end the takeover by negotiating over the phone with representatives of the three dominant gangs. The gangs included the Muslims, led by Sanders, who controlled L6; the Aryans, led by Jason Robb and Skatzes, who controlled L2; and the \u25a0 Black Gangster Disciples, led by Anthony Lavelle, who controlled LI. Inmates controlled access'to and from any area of L block.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"196\">*196</page-number>{\u00b6 5} Several corrections officers (\u201cC.O.s\u201d), including Robert Vallandingham, who was working in LI that day, were taken hostage. As the riot unfolded in its early stages, Vallandingham had locked himself in the corrections officers\u2019 LI restroom. Inmates were able to batter open the restroom door and take him hostage. Other inmates saw Sanders and Were escort Vallandingham to L6. Other guards taken hostage were eventually held in L6 as well, except for C.O.s Darrold Clark and Jeff Ratcliff, who were confined for most of the riot in L2.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-5\">{\u00b6 6} During the initial stages of the riot, inmates stormed to the back stairwell of L2 where C.O. Ratcliff and inmate Earl Elder had locked themselves. Using a weight bar, inmates punched holes in the wall next to the L2 stairwell door. Ratcliff came out of the stairwell and was beaten. Inmates then brought Elder out of the stairwell and began beating him with baseball bats and stabbing him with shanks. Robb was heard telling Elder, \u201cYou want to be police, we will show you what it is to be police.\u201d Elder was then locked in a cell in L6.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-6\">{\u00b6 7} Later that night, Lucky Roper, a Muslim inmate, met with Skatzes in the gym. Skatzes then went to Snodgrass and told him, \u201cWe got to go to L6.\u201d At L6, Skatzes told Snodgrass: \u201cI want you to take this guy out.\u201d Then Skatzes, Roper, and Snodgrass went to the cell where Elder was being held, and Skatzes told Snodgrass, \u201cGo ahead and take care <em>of </em>your business, son.\u201d Snodgrass went into the cell and stabbed Elder numerous times. When Snodgrass came out of the cell, Skatzes put his arm around him and said, \u201cYou did a good job, brother, I am proud of you.\u201d Elder\u2019s body was placed in the recreation yard at 10:15 the next morning. He died from multiple stab wounds in his chest and head, as well as skull fractures.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-7\">{\u00b6 8} On April 12, prison authorities turned off the electricity and water in L block. Skatzes shouted from a window with a bullhorn, demanding that the authorities turn the power back on. He also had C.O.-hostage Ratcliff identify himself using the bullhorn and demand that power be restored inside L block.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-8\">{\u00b6 9} Within two or three days of the takeover, FBI technicians had placed microphones in the tunnels underneath L block to record inmate conversations. By the end of the riot, 591 \u201ctunnel tapes\u201d had been recorded.</p>\n<p id=\"b274-9\">{\u00b6 10} The inmate leaders negotiated over the phone with prison authorities. Inmate David Sommers controlled the phones and tape-recorded the inmate leaders during their negotiations with prison authorities. During the first half of the riot, Skatzes was one of the lead inmate negotiators. He told the prison negotiators to stop tear-gassing K block, which they were doing to quell a disturbance, or they were \u201cgoing to cost an officer\u2019s life.\u201d As he continued to argue with authorities over the phone, Skatzes declared, \u201c[Y]ou just cost an officer\u2019s life.\u201d At that time, however, the inmates had not killed a guard.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"197\">*197</page-number>{\u00b6 11} At another time during the siege, Skatzes and Robb ordered a crew of inmates to make a hole in a back wall of L7. They planned to kill a C.O. and dangle his body out of the back of L7, where it could be seen from the front of the SOCF by members of the media. In addition, Skatzes instructed inmates guarding the C.O. hostages to kill them if authorities came into L block.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-6\">{\u00b6 12} On April 14, the inmate leaders met in L2 to discuss a solution to the stalemate on their demands. In addition to the gang leaders, including Skatzes, other inmates within the three gangs also attended the meeting. According to Lavelle, a vote was taken to kill a guard if their demands were not met. \u201cNo one spoke against doing it, so it was agreed it would happen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-7\">{\u00b6 13} Later that evening on April 14, inmate Miles Hogan overheard a conversation between Skatzes, Sanders, and inmate Stanley Cummings. They talked about the fact that someone who was supposed to kill a C.O. had backed out. Skatzes blurted out: \u201cFuck the CO, I will kill the CO or fuckin\u2019 COs.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b275-8\">{\u00b6 14} Another inmate-leader meeting took place on the morning of April 15. At that time, Skatzes got on the phone and demanded that prison authorities restore water and power within L block or \u201cthere would be a guaranteed murder.\u201d He added, \u201cDo your thing. 10:30 or a dead man\u2019s out there.\u201d He said that if the water and power were not turned back on by 10:30, \u201cthe hardliners were going to step in and take over.\u201d At the inmate meeting of leaders, a vote was taken to kill a C.O., and a member from each inmate gang was chosen to participate in the killing. According to witnesses at the meeting, Skatzes agreed with the decision to kill a C.O.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-9\">{\u00b6 15} The deadline set by Skatzes passed without the water or power being restored. Officer Vallandingham was killed in L6 by Muslim inmates. Several masked inmates carried Vallandingham\u2019s body out of L6 and down the L corridor to the gym. Skatzes walked behind those who carried the body. At 11:10 a.m., Vallandingham\u2019s body was placed in the recreation yard. The coroner later concluded that Vallandingham had died by ligature strangulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-10\">{\u00b6 16} Negotiations resumed that afternoon, and the inmate leaders agreed to release a C.O. in exchange for allowing Skatzes to make a live radio broadcast to air the concerns and demands of the inmates. The broadcast took place that evening at 7:30 p.m. in the recreation yard. After the broadcast, C.O. Darrold Clark was released. Although he had a transcript, Skatzes\u2019s performance was described as \u201crambling.\u201d Many inmates were not pleased, and Sanders told Robb that he wanted him to make all future decisions on behalf of the Aryans. Skatzes\u2019s role as an inmate negotiator diminished thereafter.</p>\n<p id=\"b275-11\">{\u00b6 17} The following day, April 16, prison officials agreed to allow inmate Cummings to broadcast inmate grievances on television, in exchange for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"198\">*198</page-number>release of another C.O. At 1:35 p.m., C.O. Tony Demons was released while Cummings delivered his live television address.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-5\">{\u00b6 18} The takeover continued because Sanders and Robb reportedly wanted to break the record for the longest prison takeover in the United States. Finally, on April 20 and 21, Sanders, Robb, and Lavelle met with attorney Niki Schwartz to discuss ending the takeover. They reached an agreement, and the inmates began to surrender on April 21.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-6\">{\u00b6 19} Meanwhile, during a meeting in L2 between Robb, Lavelle, and Sanders, the gang leaders decided that inmate David Sommers, who controlled the phones and ran the inmates\u2019 tape player throughout the negotiations \u201chad to die, he knew too much.\u201d Sommers had a reputation as a snitch before the <em>riot. </em>Robert Brookover also had a reputation as a snitch, but he was given a choice: kill someone or be killed. Brookover asked Skatzes if he was going to be killed. Skatzes replied, \u201c[J]ust take care of business, be cool.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b276-7\">{\u00b6 20} The surrender was held up for a period of time because, as Skatzes, Robb, Sanders, and Cummings told Lavelle, they had \u201csome things [they had] to take care of.\u201d An inmate called \u201cKinky\u201d gave Brookover baker\u2019s clothes (kitchen whites, which Brookover put on), a shank, and an extension cord. Skatzes, Snodgrass, and Bocook also changed into different clothes. When Robb arrived, the group went to L7 across the corridor from L2. Bocook instructed Brookover to retrieve baseball bats out of a guitar ease in the back of L7. When they arrived in L7, no one was there. Bocook screamed, \u201cWhere\u2019s that bitch Sommers at.\u201d Robb left to get Sommers from L2 and, moments later, Sommers was seen chasing Robb into L7. Brookover tackled Sommers and stabbed him. Skatzes ran up and kicked Sommers in the head. Brookover followed orders to choke Sommers with the extension cord, and then Skatzes struck Sommers in the head with a baseball bat at least three times. Brookover and the others beat and stabbed Sommers until he was dead. Then the killers cleaned themselves, burned their clothes, and surrendered to authorities.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-8\">{\u00b6 21} Prison authorities found Sommers\u2019s body in L7. The coroner attributed death to a massive blow to the head leading to skull fracture, laceration of the skull, and other severe brain injuries and bleeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b276-9\">{\u00b6 22} The Scioto County Grand Jury indicted Skatzes on six counts of aggravated murder, two counts each for the murders of Vallandingham, Elder, and Sommers. Each murder count carried four death specifications: murder in a detention facility [R.C. 2929.04(A)(4) ], a prior aggravated murder conviction [R.C. 2929.04(A)(5) ], murder as a course of conduct [R.C. 2929.04(A)(5) ], and murder during a kidnapping [R.C. 2929.04(A)(7) ]. Skatzes was also indicted on three counts of kidnapping [R.C. 2905.01].</p>\n<p id=\"b277-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"199\">*199</page-number>{\u00b6 23} The trial court changed venue to Montgomery County, and the case was tried before a jury. After the state presented its case, the defense called five witnesses, including former hostage C.O. Ratcliff. Skatzes testified in his own behalf. The defense claimed that Skatzes had been a peacemaker during the prison takeover and had opposed killing a C.O. Skatzes denied involvement in the Elder and Sommers murders. The jury found Skatzes guilty on all counts and specifications. After a mitigation hearing, the jury recommended death for the murders of Elder and Sommers and a life sentence for the murder of Vallandingham. The trial judge sentenced Skatzes accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-6\">{\u00b6 24} In January 2003, the court of appeals affirmed Skatzes\u2019s convictions and death sentence but vacated his conviction for the kidnapping of Elder at the state\u2019s request. The cause is now before the court upon an appeal as of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-7\">{\u00b6 25} Appellant Skatzes has raised 60 propositions of law. We have reviewed each and have determined that none justifies reversal of appellant\u2019s convictions or his death sentence. We have also independently weighed the aggravating circumstances against the evidence presented in mitigation and have reviewed the death penalty for appropriateness and proportionality. For the reasons that follow, we affirm appellant\u2019s convictions and death sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-8\">PRETRIAL/VOIR DIRE ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"APVy\">\n<em>Alleged Flatus in the Indictment</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b277-9\">{\u00b6 26} In his first five propositions of law, Skatzes argues that each count in the indictment and each death-penalty/kidnapping specification was defective because the indictment failed to demonstrate on its face the basis for indicting him, and the indictment or specification failed to provide notice of the allegations against him. Skatzes failed to object to the form of the indictment before trial as required by Crim.R. 12(B)(2), however, and thus has waived all but plain error. <em>State v. Frazier </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 323, 332, 652 N.E.2d 1000. In any event, the indictments tracked the language of the definition of kidnapping in R.C. 2905.01(A) and, therefore, properly charged the offenses. <em>State v. Murphy </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 554, 583, 605 N.E.2d 884; <em>State v. Landrum </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 107, 119, 559 N.E.2d 710; Crim.R. 7(B). In addition, Skatzes obtained a bill of particulars that provided him with the information he sought and identified aggravated riot as the felony underlying the R.C. 2905.01(A)(2) kidnapping charges. <em>Murphy, </em>65 Ohio St.3d at 583, 605 N.E.2d 884. Skatzes acknowledged at his arraignment that he understood the charges and waived the reading of the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b277-10\">{\u00b627} In proposition of law I, Skatzes alleges that the indictment was insufficient to charge aggravated murder involving a kidnapping because it failed to name or identify the kidnapping victims, failed to inform him of the facts and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"200\">*200</page-number>elements of the charge of kidnapping he faced, and failed to identify the applicable Revised Code section of the kidnapping charges. To the contrary, the indictments for kidnapping tracked the language of R.C. 2905.01(A) and properly charged the offenses. The bill of particulars also provided Skatzes with the information he sought. Plain error is lacking. We reject proposition of law I.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-4\">{\u00b6 28} In proposition of law II, Skatzes essentially repeats the same argument raised in proposition of law I but directs it toward the kidnapping-based death-penalty specifications. Again, Skatzes does not demonstrate plain error. The indictment tracked the statutory language, and the bill of particulars eliminated any confusion Skatzes may have had about the charges. We reject proposition of law II.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-5\">{\u00b6 29} In proposition of law III, Skatzes contends that the indictment was insufficient in naming four of the five purposes of the kidnapping statute [R.C. 2905.01(A)(1), (2), (3) and (5) ] in the disjunctive. Skatzes further asserts that the indictment failed to identify the felony underlying the kidnapping-offense alternatives charged under R.C. 2905.01(A)(2) and failed to demonstrate the basis of the grand jury findings. As noted by the court of appeals, it was apparent that the prosecution intended to show that Skatzes had engaged in kidnapping for all of the stated statutory purposes rather than just one of them. Use of the word \u201cor\u201d in the indictment was not vague, since the alleged purposes listed were not mutually exclusive. In addition, the bill of particulars identified aggravated riot as the felony underlying the R.C. 2905.01(A)(2) kidnapping charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-6\">{\u00b6 30} Moreover, Skatzes\u2019s reliance on <em>State v. Childs </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 194, 724 N.E.2d 781, is misplaced. In <em>Childs, </em>we held that an indictment\u2019s failure to allege an overt act in furtherance of an alleged conspiracy was a fatal defect. Here, the omission of the underlying felony in the indictment was remedied because the bill of particulars identified the underlying felony, as is permitted where the indictment sufficiently tracked the wording of the kidnapping statute. <em>Murphy, </em>65 Ohio St.3d at 583, 605 N.E.2d 884. In addition, there is no requirement that the indictment demonstrate the basis for the grand jury\u2019s findings. The bill of particulars serves this function. We reject proposition of law III.</p>\n<p id=\"b278-7\">{\u00b6 31} In proposition of law IV, Skatzes contends that the indictment was defective because it failed to identify the underlying felony in the kidnapping charge or the elements of the underlying felony. As discussed under proposition of law III, however, the indictment tracked the language of the kidnapping statute. The bill of particulars identified aggravated riot as the underlying felony and remedied any defect in the indictment. <em>Murphy, </em>65 Ohio St.3d at 583, 605 N.E.2d 884. Skatzes\u2019s claim regarding the failure to list the elements of aggravated riot was not outcome-determinative plain error since Skatzes was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"201\">*201</page-number>sufficiently informed of the charges against him in both the indictment and bill of particulars. <em>State v. Frazier, </em>73 Ohio St.3d at 332, 652 N.E.2d 1000. We reject proposition of law IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-5\">{\u00b6 32} Finally, in proposition of law V, Skatzes contends that even though Ohio law does not require complicity or conspiracy to be charged in the indictment in every instance, the failure to charge complicity or conspiracy in his case means that the indictment failed to give notice of the charges. Skatzes again fails to demonstrate plain error. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of the principal offense. R.C. 2923.03(F). See <em>State v. Dotson </em>(1987), 35 Ohio App.3d 135, 520 N.E.2d 240, paragraph two of the syllabus. Skatzes was on notice that evidence could be presented that he was a principal offender or complicit in the aggravated murders. The indictment and bill of particulars put Skatzes on notice of the charges he faced. We reject proposition of law V.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-6\">\n<em>Prejudicial Joinder</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b279-7\">{\u00b6 33} In proposition of law XV, Skatzes contends that the trial court erred in denying his motion to sever the charges against him. Skatzes asserts that joinder was prejudicial because the offenses were separate in time, method, and degree of involvement by Skatzes. \u201cThe law favors joining multiple offenses in a single trial under Crim.R. 8(A) if the offenses charged \u2018are of the same or similar character.\u2019\u201d <em>State v. Lott </em>(1990), 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 163, 555 N.E.2d 293. Crim.R. 8(A) also allows joinder of two or more offenses that \u201care based on the same act or transactions * * * connected together or constituting parts of a common scheme or plan; or are part of a course of criminal conduct.\u201d <em>State v. Lorraine </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 414, 425, 613 N.E.2d 212. An appellate court will reverse a trial court\u2019s denial of severance only if the trial court has abused its discretion. <em>Lott, </em>51 Ohio St.3d at 163, 555 N.E.2d 293.</p>\n<p id=\"b279-8\">{\u00b6 34} The trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Skatzes\u2019s motion to sever. First, the charged offenses committed by Skatzes were part of a common scheme to gain concessions from prison authorities for inmate demands and to silence inmate snitches. Crim.R. 8(A). Second, even if Skatzes had been tried separately for his charged offenses, the state would still have been able to introduce evidence of the joined offenses as \u201cother acts\u201d under Evid.R. 404(B). Third, the evidence of each crime joined at trial was \u201csimple and direct,\u201d so that proof of the separate offenses could be readily separated. <em>State v. LaMar, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 181, 2002-Ohio-2128, 767 N.E.2d 166, at \u00b6 50-51. Thus, Skatzes was not prejudiced by joinder of offenses. See <em>Lott, </em>51 Ohio St.3d at 163, 555 N.E.2d 293. We reject proposition of law XV.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>\n<em>Limits on Voir Dire</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b280-5\">{\u00b6 35} In proposition of law XVI, Skatzes contends that the trial court unfairly-denied him the right to explore juror attitudes on specific mitigating factors. Skatzes also alleges that the trial court erred in denying his challenge for cause of a prospective juror who expressed unwillingness to consider specific items of mitigation evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-6\">{\u00b6 36} The trial court acted within its discretion in disallowing specific questions to individual prospective jurors on specific mitigating factors. See <em>State v. Lundgren </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 474, 481, 653 N.E.2d 304. <em>Morgan v. Illinois </em>(1992), 504 U.S. 719, 112 S.Ct. 2222, 119 L.Ed.2d 492, does not require judges to allow individual voir dire on separate mitigating factors. See <em>State v. Wilson </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 381, 386, 659 N.E.2d 292. A review of the entire voir dire indicates that the detailed questioning that occurred over a ten-day period was adequate to expose faults that would render a juror ineligible. See <em>State v. Rogers </em>(1985), 17 Ohio St.3d 174, 17 OBR 414, 478 N.E.2d 984, paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-7\">{\u00b6 37} The court did not abuse its discretion in denying Skatzes\u2019s challenge for cause on prospective juror Hicks. Although Hicks stated initially that the gravity of the offenses might prevent her from considering life sentences, she specifically agreed to follow the court\u2019s instructions, even if it involved evidence she hypothetically might be skeptical of considering. We reject proposition of law XVI.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-8\">\n<em>Adequacy of Counsel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b280-9\">{\u00b6 38} In proposition of law XXXVI, Skatzes asserts that the trial court failed to conduct an adequate inquiry when he requested substitute counsel. The record indicates, however, that Skatzes never requested substitute counsel. Although Skatzes sent a letter to the trial judge addressing some specific problems and concerns about being able to review some audiotapes and other evidence, that letter is not part of the record. Nevertheless, the trial court asked both parties about the allegations in the letter and the status of discovery. The trial judge assured Skatzes that he would have the opportunity to review all the tapes. When asked by the trial judge whether he wanted to fire counsel, Skatzes denied that he was requesting that counsel be removed from the case or substituted. Skatzes opined that he and defense counsel could \u201ciron this thing out.\u201d We reject proposition of law XXXVI.</p>\n<p id=\"b280-10\">\n<em>Death Qualification of Jury</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b280-11\">{\u00b6 39} In proposition of law XLVI, Skatzes contends that death qualification of jurors violated his right to a fair and impartial jury. Death qualification of jurors during voir dire has been upheld by both the United States Supreme Court and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>this court. See, e.g., <em>Lockhart v. McCree </em>(1986), 476 U.S. 162, 106 S.Ct. 1758, 90 L.Ed.2d 137; <em>State v. Moore </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 22, 26, 689 N.E.2d 1. We summarily reject proposition of law XLVI.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-5\">\n<em>Failure to Record Grand Jury Proceedings</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b281-6\">{\u00b6 40} In proposition of law LIII, Skatzes argues that he was prejudiced by the state\u2019s failure to record grand jury proceedings, contrary to <em>State v. Grewell </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 4, 543 N.E.2d 93, syllabus. Skatzes asserts that he was denied the opportunity \u201cto support his case at trial upon the showing of a particularized need\u201d for the grand jury testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-7\">{\u00b6 41} \u201cGrand jury proceedings are secret, and an accused is not entitled to inspect grand jury transcripts either before or during trial unless the ends of justice require it and there is a showing by the defense that a particularized need for disclosure exists which outweighs the need for secrecy.\u201d <em>State v. Greer </em>(1981), 66 Ohio St.2d 139, 20 O.O.3d 157, 420 N.E.2d 982, syllabus, citing <em>State v. Patterson </em>(1971), 28 Ohio St.2d 181, 57 O.O.2d 422, 277 N.E.2d 201, paragraph three of the syllabus. The trial court, in its discretion, determines whether the defendant has shown a particularized need for the production of grand jury proceedings. <em>Greer </em>at 148, 20 O.O.3d 157, 420 N.E.2d 982. Skatzes filed a motion for disclosure of exculpatory and impeaching information and included a request that the state identify \u201ceach occasion on which any witness has testified before any court, grand jury or other tribunal or body.\u201d At a pretrial hearing, the defense stated that it was looking for inconsistencies in the testimony of any witness from one occasion to another. The state responded that no live witnesses had appeared before the grand jury and that the defense had received summaries and transcripts of videotaped depositions that had been played before the grand jury. Defense counsel then conceded that the state\u2019s response disposed of the motion, and the trial court opined that the issue was therefore moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-8\">{\u00b642} Nothing in the record substantiates Skatzes\u2019s claim that grand jury proceedings were not recorded. Moreover, defense counsel not only failed to demonstrate any particularized need for the grand jury transcripts, they conceded before trial that the state\u2019s response disposed of his motion for the grand jury transcripts. We reject proposition of law LIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b281-9\">\n<em>Discovery</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b281-10\">{\u00b6 43} In proposition of law LVII, Skatzes contends that the state failed to provide the defense with timely and complete discovery. Specifically, Skatzes asserts that the state failed to produce \u201c[a]ll statements and evidence inconsistent with the State\u2019s theory of guilt\u201d from the State Highway Patrol\u2019s 1,395 interviews conducted in connection with his case. Crim.R. 16(B), however, \u201cdoes not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"204\">*204</page-number>authorize the discovery or inspection * * * of the statements made by witnesses or prospective witnesses to state agents.\u201d Crim.R. 16(B)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-5\">{\u00b6 44} The highway patrol\u2019s 1,395 interviews following the riot constituted statements made by witnesses or prospective witnesses to state agents and were not discoverable unless they were favorable to Skatzes. See Crim.R. 16(B)(1)(f). Skatzes asserts that the state used a computer program to help sort information it obtained from these interviews and that it discarded any information considered \u201cfalse\u201d because that information would be inconsistent with its theory of the case. Skatzes provides no evidence to support this assertion; we will not presume that the state withheld exculpatory evidence from Skatzes.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-6\">{\u00b6 45} Skatzes next contends that not all of the 591 tunnel tapes or 17 negotiation tapes were turned over to the defense. Yet, at a pretrial hearing at the outset of voir dire, defense counsel acknowledged that it had received all of the tunnel tapes as well as copies and transcripts of the negotiation tapes.</p>\n<p id=\"b282-7\">{\u00b6 46} Skatzes also argues that the state failed to produce plea agreements of inmates whose statements were admitted pursuant to Evid.R. 801(D)(2)(e) as co-conspirator testimony, but who did not testify at Skatzes\u2019s trial. In <em>Giglio v. United States </em>(1972), 405 U.S. 150, 92 S.Ct. 763, 31 L.Ed.2d 104, the case Skatzes cites as support, the government failed to disclose an alleged promise of leniency made to its key witness in return for his testimony. Id. at 154, 92 S.Ct. 763, 31 L.Ed.2d 104. The statements of Skatzes\u2019s co-conspirators are not \u201cwitnesses\u201d as that term is normally defined. Thus, Skatzes has no basis to claim that the state was compelled to produce the plea agreements of inmates whose statements were admitted under Evid. R. 801(D)(2)(e).</p>\n<p id=\"b282-8\">{\u00b6 47} Skatzes further claims that not all scientific evidence regarding the time of Vallandingham\u2019s death was turned over to the defense and that the missing evidence would have shown that Vallandingham died long before the meeting in which Skatzes allegedly voted to kill a guard. This claim involves the coroner\u2019s testimony about a vitreous-eye-fluid test that led the coroner to opine that Vallandingham could have died as early as 6:00 a.m. on April 15, 1993. The coroner also testified that the test produced nothing \u201cinconsistent with him having been killed around 10:30 on the morning of the 15th.\u201d Nothing in the record supports Skatzes\u2019s claim that he did not receive these test results. Neither does the record suggest that Vallandingham died \u201clong before\u201d the meeting in which inmate gang leaders decided to kill a guard. Finally, Skatzes did not object to the coroner\u2019s testimony that Vallandingham died at 7:00 a.m. on April 15, plus or minus one hour, based on the results of the vitreous-fluid test. Even assuming Skatzes did not receive this test, he was not prejudiced because the coroner testified that the time of death could have been 10:30 a.m.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"205\">*205</page-number>{\u00b6 48} Skatzes also asserts that not all audio- and videotapes were turned over to the defense. Skatzes does not explain or suggest what tapes should have been turned over but were not.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-6\">{\u00b6 49} Based on all the foregoing, we reject proposition of law LVII.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-7\">TRIAL ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b283-8\">\n<em>Jury Instructions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b283-9\">{\u00b6 50} In propositions of law VI through XIII, Skatzes contends that he was prejudiced by several jury instructions at the close of the trial phase.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-10\">{\u00b6 51} In propositions of law VI and VII, Skatzes argues that the trial court improperly failed to instruct the jury to reach a unanimous decision on the following three issues: whether disorderly conduct was committed, which section of the aggravated riot statute was violated, and which of the statutorily enumerated purposes was the basis of each kidnapping charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-11\">{\u00b6 52} Skatzes\u2019s failure to object to the instructions waives all but plain error. <em>State v. Underwood </em>(1983), 3 Ohio St.3d 12, 3 OBR 360, 444 N.E.2d 1332, syllabus. Plain error \u201cshould be applied with utmost caution and should be invoked only to prevent a clear miscarriage of justice.\u201d Id. at 14, 3 OBR 360, 444 N.E.2d 1332. Plain error exists only where it is clear that the verdict would have been otherwise but for the error. <em>State v. Long </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 91, 7 O.O.3d 178, 372 N.E.2d 804, Plain error is not present in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-12\">{\u00b6 53} With regard to Skatzes\u2019s complaint about the failure to instruct on which purpose was the basis of each kidnapping charge, Skatzes essentially argues that his right to a unanimous verdict includes a right to a unanimous theory of culpable conduct supporting that verdict. The United States Supreme Court rejected a similar argument in <em>Schad v. Arizona </em>(1991), 501 U.S. 624, 111 S.Ct. 2491, 115 L.Ed.2d 555. In <em>Schad, </em>the defendant was convicted of first-degree murder after the prosecution advanced theories of premeditated murder and felony murder. The jury was not instructed to unanimously find defendant guilty based on one of the proposed theories of guilt. The <em>Schad </em>court found that different mental states of moral and practical equivalence (premeditated and felony murder) may serve as alternative means to satisfy the mens rea element for the single offense of murder, without infringing upon the constitutional rights of the defendant. Id. at 643, 111 S.Ct. 2491, 115 L.Ed.2d 555.</p>\n<p id=\"b283-13\">{\u00b6 54} The <em>Schad </em>court noted: \u2018We have never suggested that in returning general verdicts in [eases proposing multiple theories] the jurors should be required to agree upon a single means of commission, any more than the indictments were required to specify one alone. In these cases, as in litigation generally, \u2018different jurors may be persuaded by different pieces of evidence, even when they agree upon the bottom line. Plainly there is no general <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"206\">*206</page-number>requirement that the jury reach agreement on the preliminary factual issues which underlie the verdict.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 631-632, 111 S.Ct. 2491, 115 L.Ed.2d 555, quoting <em>McKoy v. N. Carolina </em>(1990), 494 U.S. 433, 449, 110 S.Ct. 1227, 108 L.Ed.2d 369 (Blackmun, J., concurring).</p>\n<p id=\"b284-5\">{\u00b6 55} The court of appeals in the instant case stated that the five purposes listed in the kidnapping statute [R.C. 2905.01(A) ] \u201creflect notions of equivalent blameworthiness or culpability\u201d that justify treating them as alternative means to satisfy the mental element of a single offense. <em>State v. Avery </em>(1998), 126 Ohio App.3d 36, 48, 709 N.E.2d 875, citing <em>Schad, </em>501 U.S. at 643-644, 111 S.Ct. 2491, 115 L.Ed.2d 555. In our view, the reasoning of <em>Avery </em>is logical and follows the reasoning of <em>Schad v. Arizona. </em>Therefore, we hold that because all the jurors in Skatzes\u2019s case agreed on the verdict, they were not required to unanimously agree upon any one purpose for Vallandingham\u2019s kidnapping. The trial court did not commit plain error in failing to give such an instruction. See <em>State v. Bell </em>(1996), 112 Ohio App.3d 473, 482-483, 679 N.E.2d 44; see, also, <em>State v. Evans </em>(Aug. 18, 1993), Hamilton App. Nos. C-910443 and C-910515, 1993 WL 311681.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-6\">{\u00b6 56} For the same reason, plain error is absent in the trial court\u2019s failure to require unanimity from the jury on either of the two definitions of aggravated riot on which the jury was instructed. The trial court\u2019s instruction on aggravated riot properly set forth that disorderly conduct was an element of that offense. We reject propositions of law VI and VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-7\">{\u00b6 57} In propositions of law VIII and IX, Skatzes contends that the trial court\u2019s instructions on complicity and conspiracy were inadequate. Again, Skatzes\u2019s failure to object to either instruction waived all but plain error. <em>Underwood, 3 </em>Ohio St.3d 12, 3 OBR 360, 444 N.E.2d 1332, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-8\">{\u00b6 58} In proposition of law VIII, Skatzes asserts that the complicity instruction was flawed in that the charge was unclear as to whether the culpable mental state required was for murder or kidnapping. The court charged the jury, \u201cBefore you can find the defendant guilty, you must find beyond a reasonable doubt that * * * the defendant, acting with the required culpable mental state for the particular offense, * * * conspired with another to commit the offenses.\u201d Plain error is not evident. The language used by the trial court tracked the language of the complicity statute [R.C. 2923.04(A) ] and is not ambiguous. Given the clarity of the instruction, jurors would have understood this instruction to mean that they should apply the culpable mental state for the offense that they found to be the object of the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b284-9\">{\u00b6 59} Here, and in proposition of law IX, Skatzes asserts that the court\u2019s instruction on conspiracy was error. The trial transcript indicates that the court stated, \u201cYou may not find * * * that the defendant conspired with others to commit an offense unless you find beyond a reasonable doubt that a substantial <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"207\">*207</page-number>overt act in furtherance of such conspiracy is proved to have been done by him or by a person with whom he conspires, and that such an act <em>wasn\u2019t </em>performed subsequent to the defendant\u2019s entrance into the conspiracy.\u201d (Emphasis added.) This instruction is plainly illogical. On its face, it required the jury to find Skatzes culpable only if his overt actions in furtherance of the conspiracy actually occurred before his involvement in the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-6\">{\u00b6 60} The record, however, contains copies of the written instructions provided to the jury during deliberations, and these written instructions correctly stated the law, using \u201cwas\u201d instead of \u201cwasn\u2019t.\u201d In addition, the trial court directed the jurors not to take notes during its charge because they would have a copy of the instructions in the jury room during deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-7\">{\u00b6 61} Even assuming that the court misstated the instruction, we find that any such error did not affect the outcome of Skatzes\u2019s trial. Not only did the written instructions correctly state the law on conspiracy, the trial court encouraged the jury to rely upon the written instructions during deliberations. Moreover, given the jury\u2019s detection of a conflict between \u201ca\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d in the jury instruction and verdict form discussed in proposition of law XIII, infra, the jury likely would have noticed a conflict in logic between the oral and written instructions and would have requested a clarification had they been confused. No outcome-determinative error occurred. We reject propositions of law VIII and IX.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-8\">{\u00b6 62} In proposition of law X, Skatzes argues that the instruction on other-acts evidence failed to adequately inform the jury as to what acts are deemed \u201cother acts\u201d of the defendant and what evidence is deemed to be evidence of other acts. He also claims that testimony on other acts from \u201cinmate snitches\u201d is \u201calways highly suspect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-9\">{\u00b6 63} Skatzes\u2019s failure to object to the instruction waived all but plain error. <em>Underwood, </em>3 Ohio St.3d 12, 3 OBR 360, 444 N.E.2d 1332, syllabus. In fact, no error occurred. The instruction given tracked the language of Evid.R. 404(B), and the trial court prefaced the instruction with language that accomplice testimony may involve special motives and that jurors should \u201cuse it with great caution and view it with grave suspicion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b285-10\">{\u00b6 64} Skatzes suggests that the trial court should have enumerated for the jury the other acts presented by the evidence and the evidence in support of those acts. Trial courts are not required, however, to characterize evidence or to instruct juries as to the category into which certain evidence fits. Moreover, Skatzes\u2019s proposal appears to require that the trial court usurp the jury\u2019s function as the finder of fact. We reject proposition of law X.</p>\n<p id=\"b285-11\">{\u00b6 65} In proposition of law XI, Skatzes complains about the court\u2019s reasonable-doubt instruction based on the statutory language of R.C. 2901.05(D). We have repeatedly rejected the same argument. See <em>State v. Jenkins </em>(1984), 15 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>Ohio St.3d 164, 15 OBR 311, 473 N.E.2d 264, paragraph eight of the syllabus; <em>State v. Jones </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 403, 417, 739 N.E.2d 300.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-5\">{\u00b6 66} In proposition of law XII, Skatzes raises a number of other alleged errors in the trial-phase jury instructions and asserts that these errors, both individually and cumulatively, warrant a reversal. Skatzes\u2019s failure to object to any of the claimed instructional errors waived all but plain error. <em>State v. Underwood, </em>3 Ohio St.3d 12, 3 OBR 360, 444 N.E.2d 1332, syllabus. We find no plain error in any of the 12 instructional errors raised by Skatzes.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-6\">{\u00b6 67} Skatzes first contends that the kidnapping instruction was inadequate and failed to identify the underlying felony in the Clark and Elder kidnappings. Trial courts were not required to identify the underlying felony. See 4 Ohio Jury Instructions (2001) 148, Section 501.01(A)(2), applicable to offenses committed before July 1,1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-7\">{\u00b6 68} Skatzes contends that the complicity instruction contained a misleading definition of the crime of soliciting another to commit an offense because it diminished the character of the request required. Yet, the language of the instruction does not support his contention: \u201cSolicit means to seek, to ask, to influence, to invite, to tempt, to lead on, to bring pressure to bear.\u201d We also note that the instruction is taken from 4 Ohio Jury Instructions (2001) 573, Section 523.03(6), applicable to offenses committed before July 1, 1996. No plain error is evident.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-8\">{\u00b6 69} Skatzes contends that the instruction on \u201cpurposely\u201d was inadequate. The instruction stated that \u201c[t]o do an act purposely is to do it intentionally and not accidentally.\u201d It is difficult to discern how this language would have left the jurors to simply presume, as Skatzes suggests, that anything more than an accident fit the definition of \u201cpurposely.\u201d Moreover, the court also instructed the jury that \u201c[a] person acts purposely when it is his specific intention to cause a certain result,\u201d and that \u201c[pjurpose and intent mean the same thing.\u201d These instructions were not erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-9\">{\u00b6 70} Skatzes next claims error in the instructions defining aggravated riot and disorderly conduct and asserts that the term \u201cfelony\u201d was never defined. Skatzes asserts that the jury may have presumed that it knew what conduct constituted a felony and may have convicted him on the basis of nonfelonious behavior. This argument is purely speculative. The trial court identified aggravated riot as an underlying felony to kidnapping.</p>\n<p id=\"b286-10\">{\u00b6 71} Skatzes asserts that the instruction on prior calculation and design allowed the jury to convict on the basis of a lesser degree of guilt than is required for prior calculation and design because the instruction did not include language that the \u201cprocess of reasoning\u201d must be in \u201cadvance of the homicide.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b287-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>{\u00b6 72} The trial court instructed the jury as follows: \u201cA person acts with prior calculation and design when, by engaging in a distinct process of reasoning, he forms a purpose to kill and plans the method he intends to use to cause death. The circumstances surrounding a homicide must show a scheme designed to carry out the calculated decision or cause the death.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-6\">{\u00b6 73} \u201cNo definite period of time must elapse and no particular amount of consideration must be given, but acting upon the spur of the moment or after momentary consideration of the purpose to cause a death is not sufficient.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b287-7\">{\u00b6 74} This instruction was adequate and did not constitute plain error. A clear reading of the instruction indicates that the \u201cdistinct process of reasoning\u201d must take place before the murder because the phrase \u201cplans the method he intends to use\u201d contemplates future action.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-8\">{\u00b6 75} Skatzes next argues that the instruction on \u201ccause\u201d was confusing and misleading. We upheld the same instruction in <em>State v. Jalowiec </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 220, 230-231, 744 N.E.2d 163. Moreover, the jury was also charged on specific intent to kill.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-9\">{\u00b6 76} Skatzes contends that the court\u2019s charge on the kidnapping specifications to the Vallandingham murder counts failed to identify the kidnapping victim. Given the context of the overall charge, it was clear that the victim of the kidnapping was also Vallandingham. See <em>State v. Price </em>(1979), 60 Ohio St.2d 136, 14 O.O.3d 379, 398 N.E.2d 772, paragraph four of the syllabus. No plain error occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-10\">{\u00b6 77} Skatzes argues that the charge on \u201cunanimity\u201d was deficient because it did not tell jurors that they had to be unanimous on each element of each crime. The court\u2019s instruction that the jury \u201cmust unanimously agree that the defendant is guilty of a particular criminal offense before returning a verdict of guilty on that offense\u201d was adequate and, in any event, did not amount to plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b287-11\">{\u00b6 78} Skatzes asserts that the trial court erred in defining \u201cprincipal offender\u201d as \u201cone who has hands-on involvement in a homicide.\u201d This court has held that \u201cprincipal offender\u201d means \u201cactual killer,\u201d <em>State v. Penix </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 369, 371, 513 N.E.2d 744, or \u201cone who personally performs every act constituting the offense\u201d of aggravated murder, <em>State v. Getsy </em>(1998), 84 Ohio St.3d 180, 197, 702 N.E.2d 866, or \u201cone who directly caused the death.\u201d <em>State v. Stallings </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 280, 292, 731 N.E.2d 159. The court of appeals agreed with Skatzes that \u201chands-on involvement\u201d was not specific enough but held that it did not constitute plain error. We agree. The instruction pertained only to the Sommers murder. Skatzes claimed that he was not present for Sommers\u2019s murder and first learned of it after the riot when he was in Mansfield. The state\u2019s evidence, however, established that Skatzes was an active participant in the Sommers murder. The error in the instruction was harmless because the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>evidence at trial showed that Skatzes was an actual killer of Sommers. See <em>State v. Chinn </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 548, 559-560, 709 N.E.2d 1166.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-5\">{\u00b6 79} Skatzes contends that the instructions regarding the verdict forms at the conclusion of the jury charge were \u201ctoo little too late\u201d in instructing the jury to be unanimous as to any alternative presented during jury instructions. The trial court, however, specifically instructed the jury, \u201cBefore you can find the defendant guilty of an offense providing alternatives, you must be unanimous in your verdict as to any alternative.\u201d Moreover, all of the verdict forms signed by the jury were unanimous. Given the voluminous number of verdict forms involved, the court did not commit plain error in failing to give the same instruction on every verdict form it reviewed with the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-6\">{\u00b6 80} Skatzes asserts that the cumulative effect of the foregoing instructional errors deprived him of a fair trial. None of the claimed instructional errors have merit, and the one that was erroneous was harmless. We reject proposition of law XII.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-7\">{\u00b6 81} In proposition of law XIII, Skatzes asserts that the trial court, over defense objection, erroneously instructed the jury in response to a jury question. On the second day of trial-phase deliberations, the jury sent the following question to the court (as read into the record by the. trial judge): \u201cCount 5, Specification 3, difference in words. Instructions say A, underline A, principal offender. Specifications for signature says the, underline the, principal offender.\u201d The court responded, \u201cThe principal offender on the verdict forms should read a principal offender * * *.\u201d Skatzes contends that the instruction was erroneous because R.C. 2929.04(A)(7) states \u201cthe principal offender\u201d with regard to the specification. We have stated that \u201cprincipal offender\u201d means the \u201cactual\u201d killer and not the \u201csole\u201d offender. As there can be more than one actual killer, there can be more than one principal offender. <em>State v. Stojetz </em>(1999), 84 Ohio St.3d 452, 458-459, 705 N.E.2d 329; <em>State v. Keene </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 646, 655, 693 N.E.2d 246. The trial court did not err in instructing the jury as it did. We reject proposition of law XIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-8\">\n<em>Statements of Co-Conspirators</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b288-9\">{\u00b6 82} In proposition of law XIV, Skatzes argues that the trial court erred in allowing inmate Snodgrass to testify that the Aryan Brotherhood had agreed with the Muslims regarding the treatment of white inmates during the riot. Snodgrass was not certain that it was Skatzes from whom he had heard about the alleged agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b288-10\">{\u00b6 83} Snodgrass testified that he had killed inmate Elder under orders from Skatzes and that Muslim inmate Lucky Roper had talked with Skatzes in the gym prior to the Elder murder and had watched the Elder killing along with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>Skatzes. When the prosecutor asked Snodgrass why he and Skatzes had been involved in this murder with a Muslim, Snodgrass replied that, according to Jason Robb, the Aryan Brotherhood had made a pact with the Muslims. Snodgrass stated that Skatzes had explained the pact to him: \u201c[N]o more white guys were going to be killed in that riot, without sanctions from the AB, * * * that if the [white guys] were to be killed, they were goin\u2019 to be killed by their own kind or at least given that opportunity.\u201d Snodgrass then equivocated and said he might have heard this from Robb or another Aryan leader.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-6\">{\u00b6 84} Skatzes claims that this testimony about the pact was inadmissible. The testimony was not inadmissible under Evid.R. 404(B), because the testimony did not refer to any prior crime, wrong, or act. If the statement was made by Skatzes, the testimony was admissible under Evid.R. 801(D)(2)(a) as an admission or statement. If the statement was not made by Skatzes, but instead by Robb or another Aryan leader, as Snodgrass conceded was possible, then the statement was admissible under Evid.R. 801(D)(2)(e), as a statement made by a co-conspirator of a party during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy. We reject proposition of law XIV.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-7\">{\u00b6 85} In proposition of law XXXIII, Skatzes argues that the trial court erred in admitting, in violation of Evid.R. 404(B), improper other-acts testimony by Snodgrass of an uncharged plot to kill several inmates at the end of the riot. According to Snodgrass, near the end of the riot, he and other Aryans had learned that some inmates were planning a coup to kill Skatzes and take over negotiations to end the riot. Those inmates involved in the alleged coup were locked in a cell in the Muslim block. When the Aryans tried to obtain the inmates from the Muslims in order to kill them, the Muslims told the Aryans they would not release the inmates because they had converted to Islam. That group of Aryans then decided to kill Sommers.</p>\n<p id=\"b289-8\">{\u00b6 86} The testimony provided the context in which Sommers was murdered. When Skatzes and other Aryans were thwarted in their plans to kill the inmates who planned the coup, they focused their attention on Sommers. The trial court could have reasonably determined that the plot to kill other inmates was not separate from the murder of Sommers, but part of the same series of events. The testimony was not improper other-acts testimony. We reject proposition of law XXXIII.</p>\n<p id=\"AXX\">\n<em>Hearsay</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b289-10\">{\u00b6 87} In proposition of law XVII, Skatzes contends that the trial court allowed inadmissible hearsay, over defense objection, when Snodgrass testified concerning a letter he had received from inmate David Snow, a member of the Aryans. Snodgrass testified that Snow wrote in the letter that inmate Brookover was \u201ca maggot\u201d and \u201ca snitch\u201d who had brought down the Aryans somehow in a murder <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>case in Arizona. Skatzes argues that Snow\u2019s letter was irrelevant and his objection should have been sustained. We agree. Nevertheless, Skatzes was not prejudiced. Accordingly, the error was harmless. We reject proposition of law XVII.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-5\">{\u00b6 88} In proposition of law XVIII, Skatzes asserts that the court erred when it overruled his objection to hearsay testimony from inmate Kenneth Hazlett. Hazlett testified that another inmate, Bobby Bass, had told Hazlett that he had been forced to carry out bodies during the riot, including the body of C.O. Vallandingham. The state contends that Bass was a forced participant in the conspiracy and that his statement was admissible as that of a co-conspirator under Evid.R. 801(D)(2)(e). The court of appeals rejected this argument but found the statement to be harmless. We agree. Bass\u2019s statement did not implicate Skatzes, and there is no dispute that bodies were carried out of L block and onto the recreation yard during the riot. Skatzes was not prejudiced. We reject proposition of law XVIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-6\">\n<em>Defendant\u2019s Prior Conviction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b290-7\">{\u00b6 89} In proposition of law XIX, Skatzes notes that the trial court granted his motion to have the court, rather than the jury, determine the existence of his prior-murder-conviction specification. Skatzes contends that he was prejudiced because the prosecutor, over defense objection, cross-examined Skatzes about his prior murder conviction during his testimony and referred to the conviction, without objection, during mitigation-phase closing argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-8\">{\u00b6 90} Under R.C. 2929.022(A), Skatzes elected to have the trial judge determine his prior-conviction specification under R.C. 2929.04(A)(5). In <em>State v. Davis </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 361, 364, 528 N.E.2d 925, we observed that when an R.C. 2929.022(A) election is made, evidence concerning a prior murder conviction not otherwise admissible may not be introduced during the trial phase to prove an aggravating circumstance. We further noted, however, that the statute does not \u201cprovide a defendant with a blanket statutory right to preclude * * * the introduction of all evidence pertaining to prior purposeful killings which is otherwise admissible.\u201d Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-9\">{\u00b6 91} During cross-examination of Skatzes, the prosecutor asked him: \u201c[G]oing back to your homicide conviction, someone snitched on you in that homicide * * *, did they not?\u201d The question arose while the prosecutor questioned Skatzes about his attitude toward snitches. Skatzes admitted that the key witness against him in the prior homicide conviction was a person who claimed to be his \u201cpartner\u201d in the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-10\">{\u00b6 92} The court of appeals determined that Skatzes\u2019s feelings about snitches, and specifically the fact that a snitch\u2019s testimony led to his prior conviction, were <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>relevant to his motive because the state\u2019s theory of the case was that Sommers and Elder had been killed for being snitches. The court of appeals found that R.C. 2929.022(A) does not preclude the introduction of the evidence because evidence of other crimes is admissible to show motive pursuant to Evid.R. 404(B). See <em>State v. Davis, </em>38 Ohio St.3d at 364, 528 N.E.2d 925. The rationale of the court of appeals is sound. We conclude that the state\u2019s brief inquiry during cross-examination concerning Skatzes\u2019s prior conviction was not improper. Moreover, the defense opened the door to the prosecutor\u2019s inquiry when it asked Skatzes during direct examination whether he had been \u201cconvicted of aggravated murder and kidnapping.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b291-6\">{\u00b6 93} We also reject Skatzes\u2019s claim that it was improper for the prosecutor to briefly mention his prior conviction during mitigation-phase closing argument. When the prosecutor made this reference, Skatzes had already been found guilty and convicted of the prior-murder-conviction specification by the jury. In <em>State v. Evans </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 231, 239, 586 N.E.2d 1042, we found that reference to a prior murder conviction during mitigation closing argument was not error \u201cbecause the prior murder conviction is an aggravating circumstance.\u201d We reject proposition of law XIX.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-7\">\n<em>Scope of Cross-Examination</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b291-8\">{\u00b6 94} In proposition of law XX, Skatzes argues that the trial court erred when it prevented defense counsel from impeaching inmate Brookover with specific bad acts during cross-examination. Brookover testified that he had killed only two people in his life. Skatzes contends that he was merely attempting to prove that this was a false statement, Evid.R. 608(B), and that he was not trying to prove with extrinsic evidence other homicides committed by Brookover. Skatzes made a proffer of documents, which the defense claims would have shown that Brookover killed one other person. These documents were sealed at a December 8,1994 hearing by the trial court but were apparently lost and are not part of the record on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b291-9\">{\u00b6 95} Evid.R. 608(B) provides that whether specific instances of bad conduct of a witness can be questioned during cross-examination is within the discretion of the court. <em>State v. Kamel </em>(1984), 12 Ohio St.3d 306, 310-311, 12 OBR 378, 466 N.E.2d 860. Evid.R. 608(B) also provides that the privilege against self-incrimination overrides the rule. Thus, Brookover could not be required to admit to any other homicide. With regard to the lost documents, the court of appeals correctly held that Evid.R. 608(B) would have precluded the introduction of general information on Brookover\u2019s character. The record demonstrates that Brookover\u2019s prior convictions, as well as his criminal activities in Arizona prisons dealing with drugs, were the subject of extensive cross-examination. We reject proposition of law XX.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"214\">*214</page-number>\n<em>Expert Testimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b292-5\">{\u00b6 96} In proposition of law XXI, Skatzes contends that the trial court erred in allowing Sgt. Howard Hudson of the Highway Patrol to testify about \u201cStockholm syndrome.\u201d Skatzes objected several times during Hudson\u2019s testimony. Each time, the trial court overruled his objection. Skatzes submits that the state was required to qualify Hudson as an expert on Stockholm syndrome in order to make such testimony admissible under Evid.R. 702 and that it failed to do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-6\">{\u00b6 97} Sgt. Hudson assisted the Department of Corrections\u2019 negotiating team during the riot because he had training in negotiations during hostage situations. Hudson explained the numerous difficulties one encounters in dealing with multiple negotiators in a hostage negotiation. Hudson further testified that the state negotiators in the SOCF riot took Stockholm syndrome into account at several points during the negotiations. Hudson\u2019s specialized knowledge of and training in hostage negotiations and Stockholm syndrome establish that he had knowledge of a matter not possessed by the average layperson. Accordingly, he was qualified to testify as an expert on these matters under Evid.R. 702, even though the court did not formally qualify Hudson as an expert on the subject. See <em>State v. Baston </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 418, 423, 709 N.E.2d 128.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-7\">{\u00b6 98} Moreover, Hudson\u2019s testimony was not hearsay because it did not convey a statement made by another, nor was it offered to prove that the C.O.s who were held hostage suffered from Stockholm syndrome. Hudson\u2019s testimony was offered to explain the state\u2019s actions in its negotiations with the inmates. Testimony offered to explain the investigative activities of witnesses, and not offered to prove the truth of the matters asserted, is admissible. <em>State v. Thomas </em>(1980), 61 Ohio St.2d 223, 232, 15 O.O.3d 234, 400 N.E.2d 401. We reject proposition of law XXI.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-8\">\n<em>Witness Speculation Testimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b292-9\">{\u00b6 99} In proposition of law XXII, Skatzes argues that inmate Lavelle was permitted to speculate, over objection, as to what was said on an audiotape played to the jury. In proposition of law XXIII, Skatzes contends that Lavelle was permitted to speculate, over defense objection, on Skatzes\u2019s state of mind with regard to another audiotape. In the first instance, the audiotape was tunnel tape 61, a recording of an April 15 meeting of inmate gang leaders, including Lavelle, where a vote was taken to kill a guard. In the second instance, the audiotape, tunnel tape 67, contained a conversation about negotiations and Skatzes\u2019s commitment to the inmates\u2019 demands.</p>\n<p id=\"b292-10\">{\u00b6 100} Lavelle was present at both of the recorded conversations and possessed firsthand knowledge of what was said. He was competent to testify regarding inaudible portions of the tapes and the meaning he attributed to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"215\">*215</page-number>statements made by the other inmates heard on the tapes. Lavelle\u2019s opinion testimony in both instances was admissible under Evid.R. 701 because his opinions as to both tapes were rationally based on his memory and perception and were helpful to the determination of a fact in issue. In both instances, Skatzes had full opportunity to cross-examine Lavelle as to what was said or meant on the tapes. Lavelle\u2019s interpretation of what was stated in both tapes was based on his personal knowledge and perceptions of the conversations in both tapes. We reject propositions of law XXII and XXIII. See <em>State v. Robb </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 59, 72, 723 N.E.2d 1019.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-6\">\n<em>Admissibility of Co-Conspirator Testimony</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b293-7\">{\u00b6101} In propositions of law XXIV, XXV, XXVI, and XXVII, Skatzes challenges the admissibility of statements made by co-conspirators in the takeover of the SOCF.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-8\">{\u00b6 102} In proposition of law XXIV, Skatzes asserts that the state failed to make a prima facie showing of a conspiracy by independent proof, as required by Evid.R. 801(D)(2)(e), and failed to make findings that a conspiracy existed or that Skatzes was a part of it. As a result, Skatzes contends that the co-conspirator statements were inadmissible and deprived him of a fair trial. Evid.R. 801(D)(2)(e) provides that a statement is not hearsay if it was made by a co-conspirator during and in furtherance of the conspiracy. Statements of co-conspirators are not admissible under Evid.R. 801(D)(2)(e), however, until the proponent of the statement has made a prima facie showing of the existence of the conspiracy by independent proof. <em>State v. Carter </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 545, 651 N.E.2d 965, paragraph three of the syllabus; see, also, <em>State v. Lindsey </em>(2000), 87 Ohio St.3d 479, 481, 721 N.E.2d 995. There is no requirement that explicit findings be made on the record. <em>Robb, </em>88 Ohio St.3d at 70, 723 N.E.2d 1019.</p>\n<p id=\"b293-9\">{\u00b6 103} As in <em>Robb, </em>supra, at 69-70, 723 N.E.2d 1019, the prosecution established at trial that the entire Lueasville siege involved a major conspiracy by inmate factions. The first three witnesses who testified on behalf of the state, Steven Macko, an inmate, Sgt. Hudson of the Highway Patrol, and C.O. Darrold Clark, established the conspiracy. Macko testified about the takeover of L block, the kidnapping of Vallandingham, the relative strength of the inmate gangs, the gangs\u2019 cooperation during the riot, and the identities of the gang leaders. Hudson provided details about the prison factions and their leaders and the tunnel taping conducted during the takeover. He also testified about the events that took place during the takeover, including the compiling of demands by the inmate gangs and their use of prison C.O.s as bargaining chips with the prison authorities. Clark, who was held hostage during the riot, testified about how the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"216\">*216</page-number>gangs cooperated in the handling of the hostages. This testimony provided the required prima facie showing of the conspiracy.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-5\">{\u00b6 104} Compelling evidence, independent of co-conspirator hearsay statements, established that inmate leaders conspired to take control of L block at SOCF, held hostages, threatened to kill a hostage, and later killed a hostage. We reject proposition of law XXIV.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-6\">{\u00b6 105} In proposition of law XXV, Skatzes contends that co-conspirator testimony is inadmissible when conspiracy is not charged as an independent crime in the indictment. We rejected this argument in <em>Robb, </em>88 Ohio St.3d at 68, 723 N.E.2d 1019: \u201cAlthough the substantive offense of conspiracy was not charged, the state could prove a conspiracy in order to introduce out-of-court statements by conspirators in accordance with Evid.R. 801(D)(2)(e).\u201d We reject proposition of law XXV.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-7\">{\u00b6 106} In proposition of law XXVI, Skatzes argues that in order for co-conspirator statements to be admitted pursuant to Evid.R. 801(D)(2)(e), the conspiracy must be a crime. Skatzes correctly asserts that Ohio law does not recognize the crime of conspiracy to commit aggravated riot under R.C. 2923.01. That fact does not render co-conspirator statements inadmissible. In <em>Robb, </em>no criminal conspiracy was charged, and we upheld the admissibility of co-conspirator statements under similar facts. <em>Robb, </em>88 Ohio St.3d at 68, 723 N.E.2d 1019. \u2022Moreover, the state presented ample prima facie evidence of a conspiracy to commit kidnapping and murder, which are recognized as conspiracy crimes under R.C. 2923.01. Even if we were to find error in the state\u2019s reliance on aggravated riot as the underlying conspiracy, that error would be harmless in view of the prima facie evidence of conspiracy to commit kidnapping and murder. We reject proposition of law XXVI.</p>\n<p id=\"b294-8\">{\u00b6 107} In proposition of law XXVII, Skatzes argues, pursuant to Evid.R. 403(A), that the probative value of co-conspirator statements offered against him was substantially outweighed by the risks of prejudice and confusion. The admission or exclusion of relevant evidence is within the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>State v. Sage </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 173, 31 OBR 375, 510 N.E.2d 343, paragraph two of the syllabus. Just as in <em>Robb, </em>the trial court here did not abuse its discretion in admitting relevant, prejudicial co-conspirator evidence against Skatzes. <em>Robb, </em>88 Ohio St.3d 59, 723 N.E.2d 1019. See <em>Jenkins, </em>15 Ohio St.3d at 222, 15 OBR 311, 473 N.E.2d 264. Moreover, \u201cEvid.R. 403 speaks in terms of unfair prejudice. Logically, all evidence presented by a prosecutor is prejudicial, but not all evidence unfairly prejudices a defendant. It is only the latter that Evid.R. 403 prohibits.\u201d <em>State v. Wright </em>(1990), 48 Ohio St.3d 5, 8, 548 N.E.2d 923. The relevant co-conspirator statements were not unfairly prejudicial to Skatzes. We reject proposition of law XXVII.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-5\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"217\">*217</page-number>\n<em>Other-Acts Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b295-6\">{\u00b6 108} In proposition of law XXVIII, Skatzes contends that the state\u2019s introduction of evidence of other acts he had committed violated Evid.R. 404(B) and R.C. 2945.59. Skatzes\u2019s failure to object to the other-acts testimony waives any error on appeal. <em>State v. Bays </em>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 15, 26-27, 716 N.E.2d 1126. Under Evid.R. 404(B), \u201c[ejvidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show he acted in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible for other purposes, such as proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b295-7\">{\u00b6 109} Most of the evidence Skatzes cites involved uncharged acts during the riot, such as destroying property, disciplining inmates by violence, and involvement in the Aryan Brotherhood. Evidence of Skatzes\u2019s involvement in the Aryan Brotherhood was offered to show his leadership role during the takeover, which bore directly upon the crimes with which he was charged. Compare <em>State v. Sanders </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 245, 256-257, 750 N.E.2d 90 (evidence of bad acts by other inmates admissible to show defendant\u2019s leadership role).</p>\n<p id=\"b295-8\">{\u00b6 110} Evidence about Skatzes\u2019s involvement in a hunger strike and stopping up toilets at Mansfield Correctional Institution after the takeover had ended should have been excluded under Evid.R. 404(B). Nevertheless, evidence on these relatively minor incidents did not prejudice Skatzes and was harmless. See <em>Robb, </em>88 Ohio St.3d at 69, 723 N.E.2d 1019; <em>State v. Gumm </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 413, 426, 653 N.E.2d 253. We reject proposition of law XXVIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-9\">{\u00b6 111} In proposition of law XXIX, Skatzes complains that the trial court admitted testimony of bad acts by other inmates in the riot. Skatzes asserts that such evidence should have been excluded under Evid.R. 403 and 404(B). Skatzes lists a number of acts committed by others that he claims should not have been admitted through a conspiracy theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-10\">{\u00b6 112} \u201cThe admission or exclusion of relevant evidence rests within the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>State v. Sage, </em>31 Ohio St.3d 173, 31 OBR 375, 510 N.E.2d 343, paragraph two of the syllabus. Arguments similar to those raised by Skatzes were raised and rejected in <em>Robb, </em>88 Ohio St.3d at 68-69, 723 N.E.2d 1019, and in <em>Sanders, </em>92 Ohio St.3d at 256-257, 750 N.E.2d 90. The evidence in this case helped prove that prison gang leaders, including Skatzes, conspired over 11 days to seize and control L-complex, settle old scores, engage in assaults, take hostages, and commit murders.</p>\n<p id=\"b295-11\">{\u00b6 113} The prosecutor was entitled to present evidence about the context of the alleged crimes to make the actions of the participants understandable to the jurors. Skatzes did not commit his crimes in a vacuum, and the prosecution was not required to proceed as if he had. The trial court, as in <em>Robb, </em>had wide <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"218\">*218</page-number>latitude to permit evidence as to how the riot began and unfolded, the rules and procedures established by the gangs during the riot, how infractions were dealt with, and the ways in which the relationships between the gangs and their members affected the events that occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-5\">{\u00b6 114} This information was relevant to the offenses that Skatzes committed, the biases of the various witnesses, and the reasons that they behaved the way they did. Given the prison-inmate culture and the gang loyalty demonstrated by gang members, much of this testimony would not be within the knowledge or experience of the average juror. The trial court could have reasonably concluded that the probative value of this evidence outweighed the danger of unfair prejudice or confusion of issues. The evidence was relevant and thus was admissible under Evid.R. 403. We reject proposition of law XXIX.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-6\">{\u00b6 115} In proposition of law LI, Skatzes complains that inmate Macko was permitted to testify, over objection, that in order to earn tattoos of lightning bolts, a member of the Aryan Brotherhood had to kill a black person. Skatzes contends that this testimony should have been disallowed under Evid.R. 403. Macko, an L block inmate not affiliated with any prison gang, testified about the symbols of the Aryan Brotherhood and what they are supposed to represent. Macko did not know whether Skatzes had any such lightning-bolt tattoos, and he did not necessarily believe that those who did had killed a black person. Macko also testified that C.O. Ratcliff had such a tattoo and was reputed to have demonstrated racial preferences toward white inmates. Macko\u2019s testimony did not directly implicate Skatzes or materially prejudice him. We overrule proposition of law LI.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-7\">\n<em>Crime-Scene Photos</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b296-8\">{\u00b6 116} In proposition of law XXXI, Skatzes argues that the 275 crime-scene photos admitted during trial had no probative value as to the crimes charged and were prejudicial and inflammatory. Under Evid.R. 403 and 611(A), the admission of photographs is left to the sound discretion of the trial court. <em>State v. Maurer </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 239, 264, 15 OBR 379, 473 N.E.2d 768. Relevant, nonrepetitive photos in capital cases, even if gruesome, are admissible as long as the probative value of each one outweighs the danger of material prejudice to the accused. Id. at paragraph seven of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b296-9\">{\u00b6 117} The crime-scene photographs were introduced during Sgt. Hudson\u2019s testimony and depicted the condition of L-block in the aftermath of the takeover. The photos were probative of the inmates\u2019 activities during the takeover and of security measures they had taken to prevent authorities from storming L-block or tear-gassing the inmates. Photos depicted the areas where inmates battered holes in the walls to capture prison guards and to take control of areas of L-block, random destruction of property, and bloody areas where violence had <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"219\">*219</page-number>taken place during the siege. Other photos showed graffiti depicting gang activity and a large array of homemade weapons. Skatzes did not object to the admission of any crime-scene photos, and defense counsel specifically stated he had no objection to their admission. Any error is waived except plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-6\">{\u00b6 118} The photos were used to present background information about what occurred in L block during the takeover, including the manner in which prison guards had been captured. They helped establish the existence of gang activity and the presence of weapons. They also illustrated the testimony of Sgt. Hudson, who was part of the negotiation team and who had knowledge of many inmate activities during the takeover. It was not plain error for the trial court to admit the 275 crime-scene photos. See <em>State v. Wickline </em>(1990), 50 Ohio St.3d 114,119-120, 552 N.E.2d 913. We reject proposition of law XXXI.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-7\">\n<em>Impartiality of Trial Judge</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b297-8\">{\u00b6 119} In proposition of law XXXII, Skatzes claims he was denied a fair trial by a judge who was not impartial. It is well settled that a criminal trial before a biased judge is fundamentally unfair and denies a defendant due process of law. <em>State v. LaMar, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 181, 2002-Ohio-2128, 767 N.E.2d 166, at \u00b6 34; see <em>Rose v. Clark </em>(1986), 478 U.S. 570, 577, 106 S.Ct. 3101, 92 L.Ed.2d 460.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-9\">{\u00b6 120} Skatzes asserts that the trial judge failed to treat the case independently because he frequently ruled in accordance with how similar matters were previously ruled upon in <em>Robb. </em>Skatzes\u2019s case was very similar to Jason Robb\u2019s case; both were alleged to be leaders of the Aryan Brotherhood during the Lucasville takeover and many of the same witnesses were called to testify in both trials. Given the similarities, it was inevitable that the same legal and evidentiary issues would arise and be disposed of on the same basis in both cases. The fact that the prosecutor and trial judge acknowledged this on the record does not mean that the judge was not impartial.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-10\">{\u00b6 121} Skatzes complains that the judge overruled defense objections but sustained state objections. Skatzes cites two instances to support his claim. In neither instance did the judge abuse his discretion in his rulings. The record indicates that the trial judge overruled prosecution objections when appropriate. No evidence of bias is apparent on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b297-11\">{\u00b6 122} Skatzes contends that the trial judge showed bias by failing to reprimand the prosecutor for making a threat. The prosecutor stated that if the defense was allowed to comb through the disciplinary records of inmates testifying on behalf of the state, he would do the same for defense witnesses. This statement was more informative than threatening; no reprimand from the trial judge was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"220\">*220</page-number>{\u00b6 123} Skatzes criticizes the trial judge for failing to sua sponte order a competency evaluation. Skatzes argues that his competence was questionable because he characterized himself as \u201cparanoid,\u201d was known by the nickname \u201cCrazy George,\u201d and demonstrated his incompetence when he testified and could not remember events during the riot. None of these claims were directly related to Skatzes\u2019s ability to understand the nature of the proceedings against him and to assist in his own defense. See R.C. 2945.37(A); <em>State v. Carter </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 593, 603, 734 N.E.2d 345. The factors Skatzes cites do not necessitate a competency evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-5\">{\u00b6 124} Finally, Skatzes asserts that the trial judge failed to control the proceedings by not properly preserving the record or exhibits for appellate review. The problems involving the record will be explored more fully under proposition of law LIV. In any event, the trial judge did not appear to play any role in the disappearance of exhibits from the record, and no bias is apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-6\">{\u00b6 125} We reject proposition of law XXXII.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-7\">\n<em>Evidentiary Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b298-8\">{\u00b6 126} In proposition of law XXXIV, Skatzes argues that the trial court erred in admitting State Exhibits 289 and 290, poster-size chronologies prepared and displayed by the prosecution to aid the testimony of Sgt. Hudson. The posters showed a time-line and highlighted events during the 11-day takeover, such as when the food drops occurred, when the water and power to L-block were turned off, and when certain inmate demands were made. The posters also included notations about the telephone negotiations and the tunnel tapes.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-9\">{\u00b6 127} Although Skatzes did not object to their introduction as exhibits, he objected to their admission into evidence for the jury to review. He claimed that some of the facts set forth in the chronology were inaccurate and disputed the identity of voices on the tunnel tapes. The trial court considered the arguments of the parties and then overruled Skatzes\u2019s objection. The court acknowledged that in a \u201cnormal case,\u201d he would probably sustain defense objections and not admit the posters. He specifically invoked the discretion of the court and stated that \u201cin a very long, very complicated case,\u201d he would allow the jury to use the posters as a reminder of the actual testimony and evidence on that particular subject.</p>\n<p id=\"b298-10\">{\u00b6 128} The admission of trial exhibits is within the sound discretion of the trial court. See, e.g., <em>State v. Barker </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 135, 146, 7 O.O.3d 213, 372 N.E.2d 1324. The court carefully considered the arguments of both sides and decided to admit the exhibits, given the complex nature of the case. The jury was aware that some facts were in dispute, including some of the information on the posters, such as the identity of inmate negotiators on the audio tapes. On <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"221\">*221</page-number>balance, the court determined that the posters would be helpful to the jury and that that factor outweighed any prejudice to Skatzes. The court did not abuse its discretion in admitting these exhibits into evidence. See <em>Jenkins, </em>15 Ohio St.3d at 222, 15 OBR 311, 473 N.E.2d 264. We reject proposition of law XXXIV.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-6\">{\u00b6 129} In proposition of law XXXV, Skatzes alleges error in the trial court\u2019s admission of State Exhibit 334, a document purporting to be the by-laws of the Aryan Brotherhood. He contends that the state did not lay a proper foundation for the document and, therefore, that the document was hearsay. Skatzes also alleges that the government shifted the burden of proof to him to show that he had no knowledge of the by-laws.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-7\">{\u00b6 130} Inmate Snodgrass testified that the by-laws were written by inmate Tramp Johnson and given to inmate Bocook, who then gave them to Snodgrass after the takeover. Among other things, the by-laws defined a \u201ctraitor\u201d as one who abandoned a \u201cBrother in the middle of a conflict or potentially violent conflict\u201d and that failure of a member to promptly heed a \u201cCall to Arms\u201d would be considered a \u201ctraitorous act.\u201d Snodgrass stated that being \u201cdeemed a traitor\u201d meant you would be killed. Snodgrass also stated that the by-laws were in effect during the takeover.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-8\">{\u00b6 131} Snodgrass properly identified the by-laws pursuant to Evid.R. 901(B)(1), and his testimony was sufficient to support a finding that the document was what he claimed it to be. Snodgrass also testified that all Aryan Brotherhood members had to learn about and accept the by-laws as part of becoming a member. This testimony supported the inference that Skatzes knew about the by-laws at the time of the riot, and it did not unfairly shift the burden of proof to him to disprove his knowledge of them.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-9\">{\u00b6 132} Moreover, the by-laws were not hearsay under Evid.R. 801(B) because the document containing the by-laws was not offered for the truth of the matter asserted. <em>State v. LaMar, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 181, 2002-Ohio-2128, 767 N.E.2d 166, at \u00b6 58-60. \u201cStatements offered as evidence of commands or threats or rules directed to the witness, rather than for the truth of the matter asserted therein, are not hearsay.\u201d <em>United States v. Bellomo </em>(C.A.2, 1999), 176 F.3d 580, 586, citing <em>United States v. Stratton </em>(C.A.2, 1985), 779 F.2d 820, 830. We reject propositions of law XXXIV and XXXV.</p>\n<p id=\"b299-10\">\n<em>Sufficiency and Manifest Weight of Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b299-11\">{\u00b6 133} In propositions of law XXXVIII and XXXIX, Skatzes argues that his convictions for the aggravated murder and kidnapping of Earl Elder and Robert Vallandingham were based on insufficient evidence and were against the weight of the evidence, respectively. In proposition of law XL, Skatzes asserts that his conviction for the murder of David Sommers was based on insufficient evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>and was against the weight of evidence. In proposition XLI, Skatzes contends that his conviction for the kidnapping of Darrold Clark was based on insufficient evidence and was against the weight of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-4\">{\u00b6 134} Pursuant to R.C. 2953.02, this court can overturn a conviction as being against the manifest weight of the evidence in a capital case, but only where the crime was committed after January 1, 1995. <em>State v. Sanders </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 245, 254, 750 N.E.2d 90. Because the crimes committed here occurred before 1995, we will not decide Skatzes\u2019s weight-of-the-evidence arguments. As in <em>Sanders, </em>we will consider these arguments as addressing the sufficiency of the evidence. Id.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-5\">{\u00b6 135} In reviewing a record for sufficiency, \u201c[t]he relevant inquiry is whether, after viewing the evidence in a light most favorable to the prosecution, any rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime proven beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>State v. Jenks </em>(1991), 61 Ohio St.3d 259, 574 N.E.2d 492, paragraph two of the syllabus, citing <em>Jackson v. Virginia </em>(1979), 443 U.S. 307, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560. \u201c[T]he weight to be given the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses are primarily for the trier of the facts.\u201d <em>State v. DeHass </em>(1967), 10 Ohio St.2d 230, 39 O.O.2d 366, 227 N.E.2d 212, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-6\">{\u00b6 136} With regard to the murder and kidnapping of Earl Elder, the state\u2019s evidence showed that during the initial stages of the takeover, C.O. Jeffrey Ratcliff and inmate Elder fled to the locked rear stairwell in L2. Inmates retrieved Ratcliff and Elder from the stairwell and then beat them. Elder was thereafter locked in a cell in L6.</p>\n<p id=\"b300-7\">{\u00b6 137} Inmate Snodgrass testified that on the first night of the takeover, after a meeting with Muslim inmate Lucky Roper, Skatzes told Snodgrass, \u201cWe got to go to L6.\u201d At L6, Skatzes told Snodgrass, \u201cI want you to take this guy out,\u201d which Snodgrass understood to mean that he was to kill someone. When Skatzes, Snodgrass and Roper arrived at Elder\u2019s cell, Skatzes told Snodgrass, \u201cGo ahead and take care of business, son.\u201d After Snodgrass stabbed Elder a number of times, he left the cell. Skatzes put his arm around Snodgrass and told him, \u201cYou did a good job, brother, I am proud of you.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b300-8\">{\u00b6 138} Snodgrass explained that he acted on Skatzes\u2019s orders because he believed that he would have been killed if he disobeyed an order from the Aryan Brotherhood. Aryan by-laws were introduced in support of this claim. Roper later told Snodgrass that Elder was not dead. When Snodgrass told Skatzes what Roper had said, Skatzes told Snodgrass that he would \u201ctake care of it.\u201d Inmate Tim Williams corroborated most of Snodgrass\u2019s testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>{\u00b6 139} This evidence was sufficient to support Skatzes\u2019s convictions for the kidnapping and aggravated murder of Elder. We reject proposition of law XXXVIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-6\">{\u00b6 140} With regard to the kidnapping and aggravated murder of Vallandingham, the state\u2019s evidence showed that on April 14, inmate gang leaders, including Skatzes, voted to kill a guard. That evening, Skatzes complained to Muslim gang leaders that whoever was supposed to kill a guard had backed out of it. Then Skatzes blurted out, \u201cFuck the CO, I will kill the CO.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b301-7\">{\u00b6 141} On the morning of April 15 at another inmate-leader meeting, Skatzes got on the phone with prison negotiators and demanded that water and power be restored within L block or \u201cthere would be a guaranteed murder. Do your thing. 10:30 or a dead man\u2019s out there.\u201d The leadership voted to kill a guard, and a member of each inmate gang was chosen to participate in the killing. Skatzes agreed with the decision to kill a C.O. hostage.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-8\">{\u00b6 142} After Vallandingham was killed, Skatzes and other Aryans followed behind when the body was being carried out by masked inmates. Viewing this evidence in a light most favorable to the state, sufficient evidence supported Skatzes\u2019s conviction for the murder of Vallandingham.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-9\">{\u00b6 143} The evidence was sufficient for the jury to conclude that Skatzes actively participated in Vallandingham\u2019s kidnapping. Inmate Kenneth Hazlett, who stayed in L6, saw Skatzes and two other Aryans move Vallandingham to a different cell on the third day of the takeover. In our view, Skatzes\u2019s leadership role in the Aryan Brotherhood during the takeover and his control over the movement and treatment of C.O. hostages support his conviction for kidnapping Vallandingham. We reject proposition of law XXXIX.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-10\">{\u00b6 144} With respect to the murder of Sommers, several inmates testified that Sommers controlled the phones in L2 during negotiations and had made some bombs during the riot. Although Sommers stayed in the Aryan-controlled L2 during the riot, he was not a member of the Aryan Brotherhood. Moreover, Sommers had a reputation as a \u201csnitch,\u201d an inmate who cooperated with prison authorities against other inmates.</p>\n<p id=\"b301-11\">{\u00b6 145} As the surrender was taking place at the end of the riot, Skatzes, Robb, Sanders, and Cummings told Lavelle that they had \u201csome things [they had] to take care of.\u201d Skatzes, Snodgrass, and Bocook dressed in other clothes in L2, and when Robb showed up, they went to L7, across the hall from L2. Inmate Brookover also had a reputation as a snitch and was led to believe that he had a choice: kill someone or be killed. When Brookover asked Skatzes if he was going to be killed, Skatzes replied, \u201cJust take care of business, be cool.\u201d Brookover was with the group that went into L7.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>{\u00b6 146} When the group entered L7, no one else was there. Bocook yelled out, \u201cWhere\u2019s that bitch Sommers at.\u201d Robb lured Sommers into L7, and the group proceeded to beat him. Skatzes ran up, kicked Sommers in the head, and hit him in the head with a baseball bat \u2014 three times, according to Snodgrass. Brookover testified that Skatzes hit Sommers in the head as \u201c[h]ard as you could hit.\u201d Other inmates also beat and stabbed Sommers. The killers, including Skatzes, then cleaned themselves and burned their clothes. The coroner testified that Sommers\u2019s skull had been \u201cshattered\u201d and that he died from a massive blow to the head. Based on the foregoing, a jury could have reasonably concluded that Skatzes murdered Sommers. The fact that others also stabbed and beat Sommers does not absolve Skatzes from culpability in his murder. See <em>State v. LaMar, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 181, 2002-Ohio-2128, 767 N.E.2d 166, at \u00b6 69. We reject proposition of law XL.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-5\">{\u00b6 147} With regard to the kidnapping of C.O. Darrold Clark, there is no question that Clark and other corrections officers were held against their will at the direction of the leaders of the takeover. Skatzes was a leader of the Aryans during the takeover, and evidence established that he exercised control over the movement of the guard-hostages and their treatment. Clark testified that Skatzes would check on him and other hostages and that Skatzes got Clark moved out of the Muslim block when Clark requested it. This evidence was sufficient to sustain Skatzes\u2019s conviction for kidnapping Clark. We reject proposition of law XLI.</p>\n<p id=\"b302-6\">\n<em>Competency to Stand Trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b302-7\">{\u00b6 148} In proposition of law XLV, Skatzes contends that he was incompetent to stand trial and essentially argues that the trial court erred in failing to conduct a competency hearing sua sponte. Skatzes submits the following evidence that he was incompetent:</p>\n<p id=\"b302-8\">{\u00b6 149} (1) he did not understand that he was waiving constitutional rights by taking the witness stand,</p>\n<p id=\"b302-9\">{\u00b6 150} (2) he did not understand the consequences of answering questions with speculative responses,</p>\n<p id=\"b302-10\">{\u00b6 151} (3) his use of colloquial phrases, such as \u201cI reckon,\u201d subjected him to ridicule by the prosecutor,</p>\n<p id=\"b302-11\">{\u00b6 152} (4) he lost a significant amount of weight pending trial,</p>\n<p id=\"b302-12\">{\u00b6 153} (5) his mental state was deteriorating \u2014 inmates testified that his nickname was \u201cCrazy George\u201d and that he had exhibited paranoia throughout the takeover, and</p>\n<p id=\"b302-13\">{\u00b6 154} (6) he had been suffering from stress and confusion at the time of the takeover.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>{\u00b6 155} It has long been recognized that \u201ca person [who] lacks the capacity to understand the nature and object of the proceedings against him, to consult with counsel, and to assist in preparing his defense may not be subjected to a trial.\u201d <em>Drope v. Missouri </em>(1975), 420 U.S. 162, 171, 95 S.Ct. 896, 43 L.Ed.2d 103. \u201cFundamental principles of due process require that a criminal defendant who is legally incompetent shall not be subjected to trial.\u201d <em>State v. Berry </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 354, 359, 650 N.E.2d 433, citing <em>Pate v. Robinson </em>(1966), 383 U.S. 375, 86 S.Ct. 836, 15 L.Ed.2d 815.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-6\">{\u00b6 156} The defense didn\u2019t request a competency hearing before trial. R.C. 2945.37 provides that \u201c[i]f the issue is raised after trial has begun, the court shall hold a hearing on the issue only for good cause shown.\u201d Thus, \u201cthe decision as to whether to hold a competency hearing once trial has commenced is in the court\u2019s discretion.\u201d <em>State v. Rahman </em>(1986), 23 Ohio St.3d 146, 156, 23 OBR 315, 492 N.E.2d 401. The right to a hearing \u201crises to the level of a constitutional guarantee where the record contains \u2018sufficient indicia of incompetence,\u2019 such that an inquiry * * * is necessary to ensure the defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial.\u201d <em>Berry, </em>72 Ohio St.3d at 359, 650 N.E.2d 433, citing <em>Drope, </em>420 U.S. 162, 95 S.Ct. 896, 43 L.Ed.2d 103, and <em>Pate, </em>383 U.S. 375, 86 S.Ct. 836, 15 L.Ed.2d 815.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-7\">{\u00b6 157} The record in this case does not reflect \u201csufficient indicia of incompetence\u201d to have required the trial court to conduct a competency hearing. See <em>State v. Smith </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 323, 329, 731 N.E.2d 645. None of the points raised by Skatzes suggest that he did not understand the nature and objective of the proceedings against him or that he was unable to assist in his defense. Skatzes\u2019s decision to testify on his own behalf does not provide indicia of incompetence; he attempted to rebut the abundant testimony elicited against him. Nor do we find indicia of incompetence because Skatzes decided to exercise his constitutional rights. Neither his behavior at trial nor his testimony provides \u201cgood cause\u201d or \u201csufficient indicia of incompetence.\u201d Deference on such issues should be granted to those \u201cwho see and hear what goes on in the courtroom.\u201d <em>State v. Cowans </em>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 68, 84, 717 N.E.2d 298.</p>\n<p id=\"b303-8\">{\u00b6 158} Skatzes\u2019s alleged paranoia, stress, and confusion during the takeover do not indicate incompetence. Such reactions are understandable in the context of conditions during the takeover and do not appear to have impaired his ability to assist in his defense. See <em>State v. Hessler </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 108, 125, 734 N.E.2d 1237. Moreover, at no time did defense counsel suggest that Skatzes lacked competence. See <em>State v. Were </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 173, 176, 761 N.E.2d 591 (counsel continually raised the issue of defendant\u2019s competency). Lead counsel represented Skatzes from his appointment in August 1994 through the January 1996 sentencing and thus had ample time to become familiar with Skatzes. If lead counsel had reason to question Skatzes\u2019s competence, he surely <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>would have raised the issue. See <em>State v. Spivey </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 405, 411, 692 N.E.2d 151.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-5\">{\u00b6 159} We reject proposition of law XLV.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-6\">\n<em>Preservation of Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b304-7\">{\u00b6 160} In proposition of law LIV, Skatzes contends that the trial court erred when it failed to keep control of the charts used by the prosecutors during voir dire to assist the state in explaining the capital trial process. The whereabouts of the charts are currently unknown. Skatzes does not make any specific argument regarding the contents of the charts; he simply asserts that he was entitled to a full record of the proceedings and that effective appellate review is impossible without the exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-8\">{\u00b6 161} In <em>State v. Palmer </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 543, 687 N.E.2d 685, syllabus, we held: \u201cThe requirement of a complete, full, and unabridged transcript in capital trials does not mean that the trial record must be perfect for purposes of appellate review.\u201d Athough we dealt with bench and in-chambers conferences that were not transcribed in <em>Palmer, </em>the issue of missing exhibits not admitted into evidence is analogous.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-9\">{\u00b6 162} Skatzes\u2019s counsel made no attempt to make the prosecution\u2019s charts part of the record in the trial court, nor did counsel object to the prosecution\u2019s using the charts as a visual aid. As we noted in <em>Palmer, </em>if the off-the-record conferences had involved objections and requests considered crucial by the defense, the same objections and requests would certainly have been raised on the record. Id. at 556, 687 N.E.2d 685.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-10\">{\u00b6 163} Here, defense counsel made no attempt to recreate the contents of the charts pursuant to App.R. 9(C). As the court of appeals recognized, Skatzes faded to make the required showing of prejudice by identifying an infirmity in the charts. See App.R. 9. As we noted in <em>Palmer, </em>general averments of prejudice cannot substitute for an actual showing of prejudice. Id. at 555, 687 N.E.2d 685. We reject proposition of law LIV.</p>\n<p id=\"b304-11\">SENTENCING ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"A8W\">\n<em>Jury Instructions</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b304-12\">{\u00b6 164} In proposition of law XLII, Skatzes asserts ten instances of error during mitigation-phase jury instructions. Skatzes first contends that the trial court erred in instructing the jury that their sentencing verdict was a \u201crecommendation.\u201d Use of the term \u201crecommendation\u201d accurately states Ohio law. We have rejected this argument in numerous cases. See, e.g., <em>Robb, </em>88 Ohio St.3d at 84, 723 N.E.2d 1019.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>{\u00b6 165} Skatzes argues that the trial court failed to count duplicative death specifications only once. Skatzes appears to argue that the trial court should have merged the specifications related to Skatzes\u2019s prior murder conviction and the present murder charges as a prisoner in a detention facility. The trial court, however, need not merge these specifications in the manner Skatzes suggests. See, e.g., <em>State v. Carter </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 218, 228, 594 N.E.2d 595; <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 149, 538 N.E.2d 373.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-6\">{\u00b6 166} Skatzes complains that the trial court failed to merge or elect aggravated murder charges for the same victim before the jury deliberated. The trial court properly merged the counts at sentencing. R.C. 2941.25(A); <em>State v. Osborne </em>(1976), 49 Ohio St.2d 135, 144, 3 O.O.3d 79, 359 N.E.2d 78. No merger is required before the jury renders its sentencing verdict, and any error can be cured by our independent review. See <em>State v. Cook </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 516, 526-527, 605 N.E.2d 70.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-7\">{\u00b6 167} Skatzes contends that the trial court failed to merge duplicative death specifications before the jury deliberated. This argument is similar to those rejected above. Any error can be remedied by our independent review.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-8\">{\u00b6 168} Skatzes argues that the trial court double-counted the death specifications in its instructions to the jury and allowed the jury to weigh eight specifications for each murder victim. The trial court specifically instructed the jury that \u201c[t]he death penalty for each individual count must be assessed separately. Only the aggravating circumstances relating to a given count may be considered in assessing the penalty for that count.\u201d A review of the court\u2019s instructions does not support Skatzes\u2019s assertion.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-9\">{\u00b6 169} Skatzes contends that the trial court failed to instruct the jury that mitigating factors need not be found unanimously. Skatzes, however, never requested such an instruction. Moreover, nothing in the record suggests that the jurors acted under such a misapprehension.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-10\">{\u00b6 170} Skatzes asserts that the trial court failed to define \u201cprincipal offender,\u201d leaving the jury to rely on the erroneous \u201chands-on\u201d killer definition given at the close of the trial phase. As we discussed under proposition of law XII, the evidence established that Skatzes was a principal offender in the murder of Sommers.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-11\">{\u00b6 171} Skatzes claims error in the court\u2019s instruction that the jury \u201cnot be influenced by any consideration of sympathy.\u201d Sympathy is not a proper factor for a jury to consider at sentencing. See, e.g., <em>State v. Lorraine </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 414, 417-418, 613 N.E.2d 212.</p>\n<p id=\"b305-12\">{\u00b6 172} Skatzes asserts that the trial court erred in failing to instruct on all mitigating factors raised by the defense. The court did, however, instruct that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>the jury could consider \u201cany other factors that are relevant to the issue of whether the offender should be sentenced to death.\u201d The failure of the trial court to tailor instructions more to the evidence is neither required nor erroneous. See, e.g., <em>State v. Landrum </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 107, 122, 559 N.E.2d 710.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-4\">{\u00b6 173} Finally, Skatzes asserts error in the court\u2019s reasonable doubt instruction. The court\u2019s instruction was proper and did not include the \u201ctruth of the charge\u201d language. See <em>State v. Moore </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 22, 37, 689 N.E.2d 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-5\">{\u00b6 174} Based on the foregoing, we reject proposition of law XLII.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-6\">\n<em>Sentencing Opinion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b306-7\">{\u00b6 175} In proposition of law LYI, Skatzes alleges that the trial court failed to conduct an appropriate sentencing evaluation. Skatzes contends that the court failed to explain why the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating factors other than to say that all the evidence in mitigation was rejected.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-8\">{\u00b6 176} A trial court is not required to accept or assign weight to mitigating evidence. See <em>State v. Steffen </em>(1987), 31 Ohio St.3d 111, 31 OBR 273, 509 N.E.2d 383, paragraph two of the syllabus. Even if the trial court failed to explain its weighing process, inadequate explanations do not create reversible error. <em>State v. Fox </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 183, 190, 631 N.E.2d 124. Moreover, any error in the trial court\u2019s sentencing opinion can be cured by our independent review. See, e.g., <em>State v. Raglin </em>(1998), 83 Ohio St.3d 253, 257, 699 N.E.2d 482. We reject proposition of law LVI.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-9\">\n<em>Alternate Jurors in Deliberation Room</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b306-10\">{\u00b6 177} In proposition of law LV, Skatzes argues that the trial court erred in allowing alternate jurors in the deliberation room. He further asserts that defense counsel were ineffective for agreeing that alternates should be in the deliberation room during sentencing-phase deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-11\">{\u00b6 178} The trial court erred in allowing the alternate jurors to sit in on deliberations, even though defense counsel agreed to it and the trial court admonished the alternates to not participate in any way in the deliberations. As we held in <em>State v. Murphy </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 516, 531-534, 747 N.E.2d 765, and <em>State v. Jackson </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 436, 438-440, 751 N.E.2d 946, Crim.R. 24(F) prohibits the presence of alternate jurors in the jury deliberation room.</p>\n<p id=\"b306-12\">{\u00b6 179} Skatzes failed to object, however; therefore, all error is waived save plain error. <em>Murphy </em>at 532, 747 N.E.2d 765; <em>Jackson </em>at 438, 751 N.E.2d 946; <em>United States v. Olano </em>(1993), 507 U.S. 725, 739-741, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508. Cf. <em>State v. Gross, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 121, 2002-Ohio-5524, 776 N.E.2d 1061, at \u00b6 134. Skatzes does not allege, nor does the record reveal, that alternate jurors participated in the deliberations either \u201c \u2018verbally, or through \u201cbody language;\u201d or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>because alternates\u2019 presence exerted a \u201cchilling\u201d effect on the regular jurors.\u2019 \u201d Id. at \u00b6 135, quoting <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 739, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508. Skatzes fails to demonstrate that he was prejudiced by the presence of the alternate jurors. See <em>Murphy, </em>91 Ohio St.3d at 531-533, 747 N.E.2d 765; <em>Jackson, </em>92 Ohio St.3d at 439-440, 751 N.E.2d 946. This court will not ordinarily presume prejudice. Id. at 439, 751 N.E.2d 946. In addition, defense counsel\u2019s decision to agree to allow alternates in the deliberation room did not amount to ineffective assistance because Skatzes did not and cannot demonstrate that he would have prevailed but for the error. We reject proposition of law LV.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-4\">\n<em>Execution of a Mentally III Person</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b307-5\">{\u00b6 180} In proposition of law LX, Skatzes contends that the record establishes that he may suffer from a serious mental illness. Skatzes asserts that we should extend the decision in <em>Atkins v. Virginia </em>(2002), 536 U.S. 304, 122 S.Ct. 2242, 153 L.Ed.2d 335, prohibiting execution of mentally retarded persons, to those who suffer from serious mental illness. Nothing in the 6,000-plus pages of transcript and record establishes that Skatzes suffers from a serious mental illness. Skatzes has not presented any evidence bearing on his mental health. None of the assertions that Skatzes was \u201cparanoid\u201d or referred to as \u201cCrazy George\u201d create a genuine issue as to whether Skatzes has a mental illness that warrants consideration as part of his sentencing. We reject proposition of law LX.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-6\">PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT</p>\n<p id=\"b307-7\">{\u00b6 181} In propositions of law XXX and XLIII, Skatzes alleges that he was denied a fair trial because of prosecutorial misconduct throughout both phases of his trial. Determining whether remarks constitute prosecutorial misconduct requires analysis as to whether the remarks were improper, and if so, whether the remarks prejudicially affected the accused\u2019s substantial rights. <em>State v. Smith </em>(1984), 14 Ohio St.3d 13, 14, 14 OBR 317, 470 N.E.2d 883. The touchstone of analysis \u201cis the fairness of the trial, not the culpability of the prosecutor.\u201d <em>Smith v. Phillips </em>(1982), 455 U.S. 209, 219, 102 S.Ct. 940, 71 L.Ed.2d 78. We will not deem a trial unfair if, in the context of the entire trial, it appears clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury would have found the defendant guilty even without the improper comments. <em>State v. Treesh </em>(2001), 90 Ohio St.3d 460, 464, 739 N.E.2d 749.</p>\n<p id=\"b307-8\">{\u00b6 182} In proposition of law XXX, Skatzes contends that the prosecution impermissibly vouched for the credibility of its witnesses in opening statements and throughout the trial. Skatzes did not object to most of the comments he cites, thereby waiving all but plain error. Although it is improper for an attorney to express his or her opinion or personal belief as to the credibility of a witness, a prosecutor may try to ensure that jurors would not be biased against his witness. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>See <em>State v. Williams </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 1, 12, 679 N.E.2d 646; <em>State v. Lundgren </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 474, 484, 653 N.E.2d 304.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-5\">{\u00b6 183} During opening statement at the outset of trial, the prosecutor told the jury that the state had difficulties gathering evidence in this case because of the length of the takeover, the number of inmates involved, the prison culture of not being a \u201csnitch,\u201d and the lack of uncontaminated physical evidence recovered from the crime scene. The prosecutor mentioned that the state had been unable to identify the perpetrators of many of the offenses committed during the siege. The prosecutor then explained that in the investigation, deals were struck with some inmates to help the state piece together what had happened during the takeover. Skatzes contends that the prosecutor created the impression that he was vouching for the credibility of the state\u2019s witnesses. The state was entitled to present evidence regarding its methods of investigation following the riot and to refer to that evidence in opening statement. In addition, prosecutors can elicit or disclose information about plea agreements \u201cto blunt or foreclose unfavorable cross-examination revealing that [witnesses] agreed to testify in exchange for favorable treatment by the prosecutor.\u201d <em>State v. Cornwell </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 560, 571, 715 N.E.2d 1144. The prosecutor\u2019s comments did not improperly vouch for the credibility of state witnesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-6\">{\u00b6 184} Skatzes contends that the prosecutor improperly vouched for the credibility of inmate witnesses through the testimony of Sgt. Hudson, who testified that he used a computer database to help \u201cdetermine who was telling the truth or not.\u201d Hudson explained that the computer database was used to cross-reference information provided by a particular inmate on different occasions. Hudson testified about the need to make deals with some inmates in exchange for their testimony and about the special protection the state gave to cooperating inmates. The trial court sustained Skatzes\u2019s objection to Hudson\u2019s comment that making deals with inmates was necessary to \u201cget the truth.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b308-7\">{\u00b6 185} Hudson testified as a \u201csummary witness,\u201d who explained the process of the state\u2019s investigation of the riot and how it determined what charges to bring against certain inmates. His testimony does not appear to be improper vouching for the conclusions reached by the state\u2019s investigators. Given the complexity of investigating crimes committed during the takeover at SOCF, the state was entitled to explain the process that led to the filing of criminal charges against inmate suspects.</p>\n<p id=\"b308-8\">{\u00b6 186} Skatzes argues that the prosecutor improperly vouched for the testimony of inmate David \u201cDoc\u201d Lomache, by making it clear that Lomache had worked with the prosecutor in deciphering conversations on one of the tunnel tapes. The prosecutor elicited from Lomache that he and Lomache had worked together to decipher the tape. Lomache denied that he was coached by the prosecutor as to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>what was on the tape. Evidence of cooperation does not constitute improper vouching for the witness\u2019s credibility.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-6\">{\u00b6 187} Finally, Skatzes asserts that the prosecutor improperly vouched for the credibility of inmates Brookover and Lavelle \u201cby indicating that their plea bargains were guarantees of truthfulness.\u201d With regard to both of these witnesses, the inmates stated that their plea agreements required them to testify truthfully and that the plea agreements could be withdrawn if they failed to do so. In two instances where it did appear that the prosecutor was trying to bolster Brookover\u2019s testimony in this regard, the trial court sustained Skatzes\u2019s objections.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-7\">{\u00b6 188} As in <em>Cornwell, </em>the prosecutor\u2019s questions were not improper and did not prejudicially affect Skatzes\u2019s substantial rights. The questions cited were isolated, and when the prosecutor appeared to unduly emphasize truthful testimony by Brookover, the trial court sustained Skatzes\u2019s objections. Such questions should not be taken out of context or given their most damaging meaning. Id., 86 Ohio St.3d at 571, 715 N.E.2d 1144, citing <em>Donnelly v. DeChristoforo </em>(1974), 416 U.S. 637, 647, 94 S.Ct. 1868, 40 L.Ed.2d 431; and <em>State v. Hill </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 195, 204, 661 N.E.2d 1068. We reject proposition of law XXX.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-8\">{\u00b6 189} In proposition of law XLIII, Skatzes asserts misconduct by the prosecutor in arguing nonstatutory aggravating factors during mitigation-phase closing argument. Specifically, Skatzes claims that the prosecutor raised non-statutory aggravating circumstances when the prosecutor stated that Skatzes \u201cwas one of the leaders, one of the people who controlled and ran the riot\u201d and when the prosecutor remarked on Skatzes\u2019s membership in the Aryan Brotherhood. The prosecutor did not state that these were aggravating factors or circumstances, nor did he urge the jury to weigh them as aggravating circumstances. Cf. <em>State v. Wogenstahl </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 344, 352-356, 662 N.E.2d 311. We reject proposition of law XLIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b309-9\">EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL</p>\n<p id=\"b309-10\">{\u00b6 190} In propositions XXXVII, XLVI, XLVII, XLVIII, XLIX, and L, Skatzes argues that trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance. Reversal of a conviction for ineffective assistance requires that the defendant show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense so as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial. <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. Accord <em>Bradley, </em>42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373. Skatzes does not demonstrate prejudice, \u201ca reasonable probability that were it not for counsel\u2019s errors, the result of the trial would have been different.\u201d Id. at paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>{\u00b6 191} In proposition of law XXXVII, Skatzes contends that defense counsel were deficient in failing to object to the state\u2019s repeated references to the Aryan Brotherhood and its beliefs. Skatzes relies on <em>Dawson v. Delaware </em>(1992), 503 U.S. 159, 112 S.Ct. 1093, 117 L.Ed.2d 309, for the proposition that membership in the Aryan Brotherhood is not relevant evidence in a capital proceeding. <em>Dawson </em>has no application in this case because gang membership was not relevant to the crimes committed in <em>Dawson. </em>Here, as in <em>Robb, </em>the Aryan Brotherhood evidence was relevant because Skatzes used his status as an Aryan Brotherhood leader to commit the crimes he did, either personally or by complicity. See <em>Robb, </em>88 Ohio St.3d at 88, 723 N.E.2d 1019. <em>Dawson </em>recognizes that gang membership and beliefs may be admissible when relevant. Id., 503 U.S. at 165, 112 S.Ct. 1093, 117 L.Ed.2d 309.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-4\">{\u00b6 192} Skatzes would not have been in a position to negotiate with authorities or to direct the actions of other inmates if not for his leadership role in the Aryan Brotherhood. This evidence was relevant and appropriate to explain Skatzes\u2019s actions during the takeover. Counsel were not deficient in failing to object to it. We reject proposition of law XXXVII.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-5\">{\u00b6 193} In proposition of law XLVI, Skatzes argues that counsel were ineffective in failing to investigate or present the defense of duress. The facts presented at trial, including Skatzes\u2019s own testimony, did not support the defense of duress. Skatzes claims that he was not involved in the deaths of Elder, Vallandingham, or Sommers. Although Skatzes admitted holding Clark as a hostage, he did not testify that he feared being harmed or lolled if he had not done so. In order to assert a defense of duress, one must logically admit involvement in the crimes charged, but Skatzes denied involvement in the crimes he was charged with committing. In addition, this court will not infer a failure to investigate a defense by counsel from a silent record. See <em>Murphy, </em>91 Ohio St.3d at 542, 747 N.E.2d 765.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-6\">{\u00b6 194} Counsel were not deficient for failing to raise duress as a mitigating factor. As set forth above, Skatzes denied involvement in the murders for which he was charged and convicted. In his unsworn statement, he denied involvement in any of the crimes of which he was convicted. Accordingly, raising duress as a mitigating factor would have contradicted Skatzes\u2019s own unsworn statement made during the mitigation phase. We reject proposition of law XLVI.</p>\n<p id=\"b310-7\">{\u00b6 195} In proposition of law XLVII, Skatzes asserts ineffective assistance in defense counsel\u2019s failure to challenge and pursue remedies for the defective indictment. As discussed under Skatzes\u2019s first five propositions of law, the information contained in the indictment was sufficient to inform Skatzes of the charges brought against him. Counsel requested and received a bill of particulars that allayed any perceived deficiencies in the indictment. Counsel were not <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"233\">*233</page-number>ineffective in failing to challenge the indictment. We reject proposition of law XLVII.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-5\">{\u00b6 196} In proposition of law XLYIII, Skatzes claims that counsel were ineffective in permitting Sgt. Hudson to testify on behalf of the state as a \u201csummary witness.\u201d Yet counsel could have reasonably concluded that Skatzes had nothing to gain from having Hudson\u2019s testimony presented by several witnesses rather than one. Moreover, counsel had ample opportunity to cross-examine Hudson and did so. A review of Hudson\u2019s testimony indicates that he had firsthand knowledge of most of the matters about which he testified. In addition, Hudson\u2019s testimony did not directly implicate Skatzes in any of the crimes with which he was charged. Hudson testified that Skatzes was one of the primary inmate negotiators during the takeover, a fact not in dispute. Skatzes failed to demonstrate either deficient performance or prejudice in counsel\u2019s determination to permit Hudson\u2019s testimony in the manner it was presented. We reject proposition of law XLVIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-6\">{\u00b6 197} In proposition of law XLIX, Skatzes argues that counsel were ineffective in failing to object to the prosecutor\u2019s comments and to Sgt. Hudson\u2019s \u201cvouching\u201d for the state\u2019s case. As discussed under proposition of law XXX, the prosecutor\u2019s questions and the statements elicited during Hudson\u2019s testimony did not constitute improper vouching for the state\u2019s witnesses and evidence. Accordingly, counsel were not ineffective in failing to object to these statements. We reject proposition of law XLIX.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-7\">{\u00b6 198} In proposition of law L, Skatzes refers to numerous instances where defense counsel failed to object or act effectively throughout trial. We will discuss each in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-8\">\n<em>Voir dire</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b311-9\">{\u00b6 199} Skatzes asserts six instances of ineffective assistance by counsel during voir dire.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-10\">{\u00b6 200} Skatzes claims that counsel failed to object to the trial court\u2019s asking each prospective juror if he or she could vote for a death verdict but not mentioning a life verdict. The trial court\u2019s initial inquiry to each prospective juror appears to be a fair attempt to ascertain which were capable of sitting on a capital-murder-trial jury. There is no requirement for a trial court to \u201clife qualify\u201d prospective jurors absent a request by defense counsel. <em>State v. Stojetz </em>(1999), 84 Ohio St.3d 452, 705 N.E.2d 329, syllabus. Failure to do so does not constitute deficient performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b311-11\">{\u00b6 201} Skatzes claims that counsel failed to object to the prosecution\u2019s \u201cinstructing\u201d the jury on the law during voir dire. The prosecution did not improperly instruct the jury when it explained the legal process of capital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"234\">*234</page-number>offenses to prospective jurors. The prosecutor\u2019s explanations were balanced and accurate. Skatzes fails to demonstrate how he was prejudiced by such explanations.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-5\">{\u00b6 202} Skatzes claims that counsel failed to ask jurors to state their beliefs about the Aryan Brotherhood, but this did not constitute deficient performance. Trial counsel, who saw and heard the jurors, were in the best position to determine whether such voir dire was needed. <em>Bradley, </em>42 Ohio St.3d at 143-144, 538 N.E.2d 373. Contrary to Skatzes\u2019s assertions, jurors who indicated pro-death penalty leanings in their questionnaires were adequately examined about their views during voir dire, including questions concerning the Aryan Brotherhood.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-6\">{\u00b6 203} Skatzes claims that counsel failed to challenge prospective juror Brooks. The record indicates that counsel challenged juror Brooks for cause. Moreover, Brooks was later excused when he indicated, before the jury was seated, that he could not sign a verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-7\">{\u00b6 204} Skatzes claims that counsel failed to object to the state\u2019s example of mitigation using a hypothetical where two men committed multiple murders during a robbery of a store. The prosecution\u2019s hypothetical on what constitutes mitigation was not improper, nor were counsel deficient for not continuing to object to it. The statute, R.C. 2929.04(B), requires the jury to consider the nature and circumstances of the offense in mitigation, and the prosecutor\u2019s hypothetical example did not falsely characterize mitigation as Skatzes asserts.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-8\">{\u00b6 205} Finally, Skatzes claims that counsel failed to object to the prosecution\u2019s \u201cinstruction\u201d that the jury\u2019s verdict had to be unanimous. Skatzes asserts that the prosecutor\u2019s response to a juror\u2019s question at voir dire violated the decision in <em>State v. Brooks </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 148, 661 N.E.2d 1030. Skatzes\u2019s trial, hqwever, was finished approximately five months before <em>Brooks </em>was decided. Moreover, the prosecutor never implied that each mitigating factor had to be agreed upon unanimously to be considered in mitigation. In any event, the jurors were properly instructed on how they could consider factors in mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">\n<em>Trial</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b312-10\">{\u00b6 206} Skatzes argues that counsel failed to object to jury instructions and other processes at trial. Skatzes cites nothing specific, however, and he admits that counsel did object to some instructions. Skatzes\u2019s bare assertions establish neither deficient performance nor prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-11\">{\u00b6 207} Skatzes claims that counsel were ineffective in failing to object to 49 instances of testimony from various witnesses on the grounds of relevancy. The vast majority of these instances are challenged under other propositions of law, and almost all of the evidence was properly admitted. Otherwise, any error was <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"235\">*235</page-number>harmless. Moreover, none of the alleged errors, either individually or collectively, was serious enough to create a reasonable probability that, but for the errors, the result of the trial would have been different. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 688, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">{\u00b6 208} Counsel were not ineffective for failing to object to the showing of television commentary during the presentation of State\u2019s Exhibit 5. This videotape contained the statement made by prison spokesperson Tess Unwin. Her statement had been cited by several inmate witnesses testifying that the inmates were upset because the statement showed that the state was not taking their demands seriously. Because this videotape was relevant, counsel were not ineffective for failing to object to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">\n<em>Relevancy</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b313-8\">{\u00b6 209} Skatzes next cites four instances where counsel failed to object to testimony and evidence that was irrelevant and should have been rejected under Evid.R. 403(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">{\u00b6 210} Counsel failed to object to testimony about the selling of marijuana at SOCF and speculation as to who sold it. The failure to object to Brookover\u2019s testimony that he sold marijuana at the prison before the takeover did not implicate Skatzes in any way. The testimony likely undercut Brookover\u2019s credibility as a prosecution witness. The failure to object to this testimony was not deficient performance.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">{\u00b6 211} Counsel failed to object to photographs admitted that were never connected to Skatzes. The \u201csheer number of photographs\u201d introduced by the state \u2014 approximately 275 photos of L block after the takeover and over 400 inmate photos \u2014 did not prejudice Skatzes. Skatzes did not explain how they prejudiced him. See <em>State v. DePew </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 275, 281, 528 N.E.2d 542. Moreover, in <em>Robb, </em>we noted that evidence relating to the \u201csetting of the case\u201d was relevant and admissible. <em>Robb, </em>88 Ohio St.3d at 68, 723 N.E.2d 1019. The inmate photos allowed witnesses to identify participants in the takeover. Counsel were not ineffective in failing to object to the photographs.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-11\">{\u00b6 212} Counsel failed to object to the attempt to impeach defense witness Officer Ratcliff. Skatzes\u2019s argument that the state improperly explored a variety of objectionable issues (accounts of inmate conduct not attributable to Skatzes, use of a statement Ratcliff did not recall, and implications that Ratcliff suffered from Stockholm syndrome) is unpersuasive. The cross-examination of Ratcliff was not improper, nor was Skatzes prejudiced by it.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-12\">{\u00b6 213} Counsel failed to object to the admission of improper victim-impact evidence. Skatzes complains that references to Vallandingham\u2019s reputation, Clark\u2019s daughter, accounts of non-gang members\u2019 hunger, thirst, and fear, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"236\">*236</page-number>descriptions of murdered inmate Pop Svette were intended to elicit sympathy and bias and that counsel were ineffective in failing to object to such victim-impact testimony. This evidence was offered to establish the context of the takeover, not to show the victim\u2019s suffering, the family\u2019s grief, or the loss to the community caused by these crimes. See <em>Payne v. Tennessee </em>(1991), 501 U.S. 808, 111 S.Ct. 2597, 115 L.Ed.2d 720. Counsel were not deficient in failing to object to it, in part, because the victims cannot be separated from the crimes. None of these failures to object constituted ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">\n<em>Other acts</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">{\u00b6 214} Skatzes argues that counsel were ineffective in failing to object to irrelevant evidence concerning the bad acts of others. Much of this evidence was properly admitted because it was relevant to the roles of the various gangs in the riot, to Skatzes\u2019s leadership role, and to the manner in which the gangs wielded their power. This evidence helped prove the conspiracy that occurred over the course of takeover. Moreover, because much of this evidence did not implicate Skatzes in these other crimes, he was not prejudiced by its admission, nor were counsel ineffective in failing to object to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">\n<em>Hearsay</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b314-8\">{\u00b6 215} Skatzes complains that counsel were ineffective for not objecting to numerous instances of hearsay testimony by Sgt. Hudson and the inmates\u2019 testifying on behalf of the state. As stated earlier, counsel were not ineffective in allowing Hudson to testify as a summary witness. Skatzes claims that it was plain error for the court to admit testimony about the killing or confinement of inmates disfavored by gang leaders, the attack on inmate Fryman, and a poem about the Aryan Brotherhood found in the cell of Aryan leader Freddie Snyder. Skatzes also complains of inmate opinions that Brookover was a snitch and what should be done with him and testimony by inmates Snodgrass, Hazlett, and Lomache that was never tied to Skatzes.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-9\">{\u00b6 216} Given the lack of evidence tying Skatzes to some of the incidents in question, defense counsel, in the exercise of their professional judgment, may have decided that the testimony was harmless or even helpful. A decision to object could have drawn undue attention to the testimony. Moreover, objections \u201ctend to disrupt the flow of a trial\u201d and \u201care considered technical and bothersome.\u201d <em>State v. Campbell </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 38, 53, 630 N.E.2d 339. The decisions by defense counsel not to interrupt appear to reflect \u201can objective standard of reasonable representation.\u201d <em>State v. Bradley, </em>42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373, paragraph two of the syllabus. In any event, the outcome of Skatzes\u2019s trial would not have been different even if counsel had objected to the evidence cited by Skatzes. The jury could readily distinguish between evidence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>that put the takeover in context and evidence that related to the crimes charged against Skatzes.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">\n<em>Other alleged failures by counsel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">{\u00b6 217} Skatzes claims that counsel were ineffective in failing to object to the admission of audio- and videotapes during trial. Skatzes asserts that the tapes were irrelevant and inflammatory. He further contends that the tunnel tapes were of poor quality and unreliable and were obtained in violation of R.C. 2933.52 et seq. We found the same audiotapes admissible in <em>Robb, </em>88 Ohio St.3d 59, 723 N.E.2d 1019, and specifically rejected the argument that R.C. 2933.52 et seq. granted any privacy rights to rioting inmates in prison. Id. at 66-67, 723 N.E.2d 1019. Moreover, the audio- and videotapes portrayed important events during the riot as they unfolded at SOCF. Only portions of the tapes were played before the jury, and those portions gave the jury an \u201cappreciation of the nature and circumstances of the crimes.\u201d <em>State v. Evans </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 231, 251, 586 N.E.2d 1042. Skatzes fails to demonstrate how these tapes were \u201cinflammatory.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">{\u00b6 218} Although the tunnel tapes were difficult to decipher, Skatzes was free to highlight their shortcomings on cross-examination. Skatzes\u2019s argument goes to the weight of the evidence rather than its admissibility. Because the tapes were admissible, counsel were not ineffective in failing to object to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">{\u00b6 219} Skatzes argues that counsel were ineffective in failing to prepare him to testify on his own behalf. His testimony differed greatly from the state\u2019s portrayal of what occurred during the riot and promoted the defense argument that Skatzes was a \u201cpeacemaker\u201d during the siege. Even though many of Skatzes\u2019s answers to questions were long-winded or rambling, this did not prejudice him. The fact that the jury did not believe his version of what happened during the takeover does not mean that counsel were ineffective in presenting Skatzes\u2019s testimony at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-8\">{\u00b6 220} Finally, Skatzes claims ineffective assistance in counsel\u2019s failure to object to jury instructions, the presence of alternates in the jury deliberation room, and in failing to bring Skatzes\u2019s severe mental illness to the attention of the trial court.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">{\u00b6 221} With regard to the jury instructions, Skatzes cites <em>Ring v. Arizona </em>(2002), 536 U.S. 584, 122 S.Ct. 2428, 153 L.Ed.2d 556, and contends that counsel failed to take steps to prevent the violation of his right to a sentencing jury \u201cthat was fully cognizant of the full weight of its responsibility.\u201d Under R.C. 2929.03(D)(2), the jury determines whether a death specification has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt, and this requirement does not run afoul of what <em>Ring </em>requires. As we noted in a recent case, <em>Ring </em>is not applicable to Ohio\u2019s capital <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"238\">*238</page-number>sentencing scheme. See <em>State v. Hoffner, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 358, 2004-Ohio-3430, 811 N.E.2d 48, at \u00b6 69-70.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">{\u00b6 222} With regard to the presence of alternates in the deliberation room, as discussed under proposition of law LV, counsel were not ineffective for allowing the alternates to sit in during deliberations nor was Skatzes prejudiced by their presence.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">{\u00b6 223} Counsel were not ineffective in not bringing Skatzes\u2019s alleged mental illness to the attention of the trial court. As discussed under proposition of law LX, the record does not establish that Skatzes suffers from severe mental illness. Counsel represented Skatzes for many months and became quite familiar with him and most certainly would have raised the issue if any mental illness were present or apparent.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-6\">{\u00b6 224} We reject proposition of law L.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-7\">CONSTITUTIONALITY</p>\n<p id=\"b316-8\">{\u00b6 225} In proposition of law LII, Skatzes challenges Ohio\u2019s death-penalty statutes on numerous constitutional grounds; as we have before, we summarily reject these claims. See, e.g., <em>Jenkins, </em>15 Ohio St.3d 164, 15 OBR 311, 473 N.E.2d 264, syllabus; <em>State v. Mills </em>(1992), 62 Ohio St.3d 357, 582 N.E.2d 972; <em>State v. Esparza </em>(1988), 39 Ohio St.3d 8, 529 N.E.2d 192; <em>State v. Benner </em>(1988), 40 Ohio St.3d 301, 533 N.E.2d 701; <em>Maurer, </em>15 Ohio St.3d 239, 15 OBR 379, 473 N.E.2d 768; <em>State v. Coleman </em>(1989), 45 Ohio St.3d 298, 544 N.E.2d 622; <em>State v. Phillips </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 72, 103-104, 656 N.E.2d 643; <em>State v. Poindexter </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 1, 520 N.E.2d 568, syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-9\">\n<em>Court of Appeals Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b316-10\">{\u00b6 226} In proposition of law LYIII, Skatzes asserts that several issues concerning the record on appeal were not resolved satisfactorily. Most of these issues involve substitute exhibits accepted by the court of appeals in its review of Skatzes\u2019s appeal. The court of appeals delayed review of this case for approximately six years in order to obtain a complete record. Exhibits from Skatzes\u2019s trial had been removed from the record in this case and used at other trials involving crimes committed during the April 1993 takeover at SOCF. The court of appeals did an admirable job in locating missing exhibits and obtaining duplicate copies of some exhibits. As the court of appeals noted in its opinion: \u201cWe are confident that, with the exception of the coroner\u2019s sketches, we have been able to supplement the record with true and accurate copies of the exhibits admitted at trial * * * and Skatzes has not advanced a credible argument as to how he was prejudiced by those sketches.\u201d <em>State v. Skatzes, </em>Montgomery App. No. 15848, 2003-Ohio-516, 2003 WL 490549, at \u00b6 447. Moreover, the trial record <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"239\">*239</page-number>need not be \u201cperfect\u201d for purposes of appellate review. <em>State v. Palmer, </em>80 Ohio St.3d 543, 687 N.E.2d 685, syllabus. We reject proposition of law LVIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-6\">{\u00b6 227} In proposition of law LIX, Skatzes asserts that the court of appeals erred in allowing the state to supplement the record with written jury instructions that conflicted with the certified transcript and were not properly authenticated. As discussed under proposition of law IX, however, the instruction found in the trial transcript was totally illogical and would have required the jury to find Skatzes culpable only if his acts in furtherance of the conspiracy took place <em>before </em>his involvement in the conspiracy. Moreover, the trial court directed the jurors not to take notes during jury instructions because they would have a copy of the instructions in the deliberation room.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-7\">{\u00b6 228} The court of appeals obtained the written instructions issued by the trial court that were placed in the jury\u2019s deliberation room. It did not err in supplementing the record with the written jury instructions that the trial court essentially encouraged the jury to rely on during deliberations. We reject proposition of law LIX.</p>\n<p id=\"b317-8\">INDEPENDENT REVIEW AND PROPORTIONALITY</p>\n<p id=\"b317-9\">\n<em>Aggravating Circumstances</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b317-10\">{\u00b6 229} Upon independent assessment, the evidence proves beyond a reasonable doubt the aggravating circumstances in this case:</p>\n<p id=\"b317-11\">{\u00b6 230} (1) Skatzes was complicit in the murders of Robert Vallandingham and Earl Elder,</p>\n<p id=\"b317-12\">{\u00b6 231} (2) Skatzes was a principal offender in the murder of David Sommers while imprisoned in a detention facility [R.C. 2929.04(A)(4) ],</p>\n<p id=\"b317-13\">{\u00b6 232} (3) Skatzes was a principal offender in the murder of David Sommers as a course of conduct,</p>\n<p id=\"b317-14\">{\u00b6 233} (4) Skatzes was a principal offender in the murder of David Sommers and had a prior aggravated murder conviction [R.C. 2929.04(A)(5) ], and</p>\n<p id=\"b317-15\">{\u00b6 234} (5) Skatzes was a principal offender in the murder of David Sommers in connection with aggravated kidnapping [R.C. 2929.04(A)(7) ].</p>\n<p id=\"b317-16\">\n<em>Mitigating Evidence</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b317-17\">{\u00b6 235} At the mitigation hearing, Skatzes presented five witnesses. John Powers, an African-American inmate at SOCF, described Skatzes as a \u201cregular guy, he was like just a straight dude.\u201d He stated that Skatzes was different from other Aryans and was not a racist, and that they respected each other. Powers asserted that Skatzes was \u201ca peacemaker\u201d in prison who had the respect of the prison guards and inmates before the takeover. Powers further testified that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"240\">*240</page-number>during the takeover, Skatzes was helpful to the hostage prison guards and did not want them to die.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-5\">{\u00b6 236} Dwayne Johnson, another African-American inmate at SOCF, testified that Skatzes treated him fairly and that Skatzes treated everybody \u201cwith utmost respect.\u201d According to Johnson, Skatzes was different from most Aryans. He recalled that Skatzes at one time quelled a potential race war in Ohio Prison Industries. Skatzes was also helpful to injured prison C.O.s during the riot. Johnson described Skatzes as \u201ca pretty likable guy\u201d and feels that Skatzes would be a positive influence on inmates if he were returned to Lucasville.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-6\">{\u00b6 237} A third African-American inmate at Lucasville, Wendell Drake, echoed the testimony of the first two mitigation witnesses that Skatzes respected people of all races. Skatzes was at the forefront of the program \u201cJuveniles to Avoid Institutional Lockup,\u201d a \u201cscared straight\u201d type of program to help counsel juvenile delinquents. Drake stated that Skatzes tried to stabilize things during the takeover and would check on the well-being of inmates. Drake felt that Skatzes helped keep the violence to a minimum during the takeover because people respected him. Drake further expressed his belief that Skatzes could do a whole lot of good because there is a lot of good in his heart.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-7\">{\u00b6 238} Lucasville inmate Charles Schweingrouber considers Skatzes \u201ca very good friend\u201d of his. He believes that Skatzes could have a positive influence on younger inmates and views Skatzes as a person who always tries to help people and does not lie. According to Schweingrouber, prison guard Jeff Ratcliff would have been in \u201cserious trouble\u201d during the takeover if not for Skatzes\u2019s protecting him. During the takeover, Skatzes would walk around, see how everyone was doing, and ensure that everybody had adequate food, water, and medical attention.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-8\">{\u00b6 239} SOCF Corrections Officer Jeff Ratcliff testified that Skatzes was an example to younger inmates and helpful to the C.O.s. Ratcliff credits Skatzes with saving his life during the takeover and claims he was helpful in trying to calm down C.O. Darrold Clark during the takeover. He testified that Skatzes was removed from the inmate-negotiating team because he relayed a message to Ratcliffs parents during his radio address.</p>\n<p id=\"b318-9\">{\u00b6 240} Skatzes gave a lengthy unsworn statement in which he stated that he disagreed with the jury\u2019s guilty verdict but accepted it. He claimed that the witnesses testifying against him were lying and asserted that he would have faced reduced charges for his actions during the takeover if he had snitched on other inmates. Skatzes professed to be \u201ca firm believer in the man upstairs\u201d but that he did not want to \u201cbeg somebody else for my life.\u201d He denied being involved in a gang and claimed that he never voted \u201cfor that man to be killed, or none of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"241\">*241</page-number>that.\u201d Based on the evidence, Skatzes stated, \u201cI don\u2019t see how anybody could justify giving me the death penalty with this kind of evidence coming in here.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b319-4\">\n<em>Sentence Evaluation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b319-5\">{\u00b6 241} The nature and circumstances of the offenses offer nothing in mitigation. Skatzes was a leader in the Aryan Brotherhood during the takeover and exercised his power to help determine who should live and who should die during the takeover. As a member of the inmate-negotiating team, Skatzes repeatedly threatened to kill a prison guard-hostage if certain inmate demands were not met. He threatened that a C.O. would be killed if the water and power were not restored to L block. Robert Vallandingham was murdered when the demand was not met by the deadline Skatzes had mentioned. Skatzes was complicit in the murder of inmate Earl Elder and counseled a younger inmate to \u201ctake this guy out.\u201d Skatzes was a principal offender in the murder of inmate David Sommers and kicked Sommers in the head and beat him on the head with a baseball bat.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-6\">{\u00b6 242} Skatzes\u2019s history, character, and background offer little in mitigation. He was in prison for committing another murder and was firmly immersed in prison culture. Even so, several witnesses opined that Skatzes was a respectful person, a good example to younger inmates, and not a racist.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-7\">{\u00b6 243} With respect to the statutory mitigating factors of R.C. 2929.04(B), factor (6) is applicable with regard to the murder of Elder because Skatzes\u2019s guilt in that murder was by complicity, not as a principal offender. In view of Skatzes\u2019s prominent role in counseling an inmate to kill Elder, this factor is entitled to very little weight in mitigation. See, e.g., <em>State v. Issa </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 49, 71, 752 N.E.2d 904.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-8\">{\u00b6 244} As to \u201cother factors,\u201d R.C. 2929.04(B)(7), Skatzes\u2019s belief in \u201cthe man upstairs\u201d and his work with juvenile offenders in a prison-sponsored program are worthy of some weight in mitigation. Skatzes\u2019s role in saving the life of C.O.hostage Jeff Ratcliff is entitled to some weight in mitigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-9\">{\u00b6 245} Nevertheless, we find that the aggravating circumstances as to the murder of Elder, the murder of Vallandingham, and the murder of Sommers outweigh the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. Skatzes was a leader in the takeover at SOCF and wielded that power to kill inmate snitches or potential snitches. His claims that he was a peacemaker during the takeover and that he was not involved in the killings of which he is accused lack credibility in light of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b319-10\">{\u00b6 246} We further find that the death penalty in this case is both appropriate and proportionate when compared with the death sentences imposed in the other Lucasville cases decided by this court. See <em>Sanders, </em>92 Ohio St.3d 245, 750 N.E.2d 90; <em>Robb, </em>88 Ohio St.3d 59, 723 N.E.2d 1019; and <em>State v. LaMar, </em>95 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"242\">*242</page-number>Ohio St.3d 181, 2002-Ohio-2128, 767 N.E.2d 166. It is also proportionate to death sentences approved for aggravated murders in detention facilities, see <em>State v. Stojetz, </em>84 Ohio St.3d 452, 705 N.E.2d 329; <em>State v. Zuern </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 56, 512 N.E.2d 585; and for aggravated murder with a prior murder conviction, see <em>State v. Spirko </em>(1991), 59 Ohio St.3d 1, 570 N.E.2d 229; <em>State v. Taylor </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 15, 676 N.E.2d 82. It is also proportionate to death sentences approved for aggravated murders during kidnappings, see <em>State v. Davie </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 311, 686 N.E.2d 245; <em>State v. Nields </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 6, 752 N.E.2d 859; and for aggravated murders as a course of conduct involving the purposeful killing or attempt to kill two or more persons, see <em>State v. Brown, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 51, 2003-Ohio-5059, 796 N.E.2d 506; <em>State v. Jordan, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 216, 2004-Ohio-783, 804 N.E.2d 1; and <em>State v.
