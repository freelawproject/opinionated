Rodak, on four counts of gambling in violation of R.C. 2915.02(A)(2). The case was designated <em>State v. Rodak, </em>Lorain County Court of Common Pleas ease No. 99CR053789. On June 4, 1999, the state moved for the forfeiture and disposal of property that had been seized from Rodak before the indictment was issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b423-17\">{\u00b6 2} Earlier, in March 1999, Rodak had filed an action against the city of Elyria in Elyria Municipal Court, seeking the return of the seized property. Rodak\u2019s civil action was transferred to respondent, Judge Mark A. Betleski of the Lorain County Court of Common Pleas. In July 2002, upon Rodak\u2019s and the court\u2019s motions, Judge Betleski placed the matter on \u201cthe inactive docket, until such time that case # 99CR053789, <em>State v. Rodak, </em>is resolved, or until such time the court shall order the reinstatement of this action.\u201d Judge Betleski further <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>noted that the parties \u201cmay move for reinstatement of this case to the active docket.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b424-5\">{\u00b6 3} In June 1999, in the criminal case, which is also presided over by Judge Betleski, Rodak filed a motion to unseal a search-warrant affidavit, a motion for discovery, and a motion to produce evidence. In August 1999, Rodak moved to suppress evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-6\">{\u00b6 4} In February 2000, the grand jury returned a supplemental indictment charging Rodak with one count of engaging in a pattern of corrupt activities in violation of R.C. 2923.32(A)(1). In March 2000, Rodak filed a motion to dismiss, a motion in limine, a motion to dismiss the indictment and supplemental indictment, a motion for disclosure of grand-jury testimony, and a motion to disqualify the Lorain County Prosecutor\u2019s Office from prosecuting the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-7\">{\u00b6 5} In April 2000, the grand jury returned a second supplemental indictment charging Rodak with four additional gambling counts, one additional count of engaging in a pattern of corrupt activity, and one count of operating a gambling house. In May 2000, Judge Betleski issued an entry that specified, \u201cUpon agreement of counsel and order of court, all constitutional and statutory time limitations are tolled from this date until further order of the court.\u201d In June and July 2000, Rodak filed various motions to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-8\">{\u00b6 6} In May 2002, at Rodak\u2019s request, Judge Betleski continued pretrial and motion hearings until July 2002. In the entry, Judge Betleski noted that Rodak waived the statutory time limits for speedy trial. Judge Betleski also denied Rodak\u2019s March 2000 motion to disqualify the prosecutor\u2019s office.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-9\">{\u00b6 7} In May 2004, Rodak moved to dismiss the indictments on speedy-trial grounds.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-10\">{\u00b6 8} On October 6, 2004, after Judge Betleski failed to rule on the pending motions in his criminal case, Rodak filed this action for a writ of procedendo to compel Judge Betleski to rule on his motions, and, if the court does not grant his motions to dismiss, \u201cto schedule trial therein within a fixed and reasonable period of time, to proceed to trial in that matter.\u201d On October 22, Judge Betleski moved to dismiss this procedendo action. On October 29, Rodak filed a memorandum in opposition to the motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-11\">{\u00b6 9} This cause is now before the court for our S.Ct.Prac.R. X(5) determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b424-12\">S.Ct.Prac.R. X(5): Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b424-13\">{\u00b6 10} We must now determine whether dismissal, an alternative writ, or a peremptory writ is appropriate. S.Ct.Prac.R. X(5); <em>State ex rel. Consumers\u2019 Counsel v. Pub. Util. Comm., </em>102 Ohio St.3d 301, 2004-Ohio-2894, 809 N.E.2d 1146, \u00b6 9. Dismissal, which Judge Betleski seeks, is required when it appears <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>beyond doubt, after presuming the truth of all material factual allegations of the complaint and making all reasonable inferences in Rodak\u2019s favor, that Rodak is not entitled to the requested extraordinary relief in procedendo. <em>State ex rel Satow v. Gausse-Milliken, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 479, 2003-Ohio-2074, 786 N.E.2d 1289, \u00b611.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">{\u00b6 11} If, however, after so construing Rodak\u2019s complaint, it appears that his procedendo claim may have merit, an alternative writ should be granted and a schedule for evidence and briefs should be issued. <em>Tatman v. Fairfield Cty. Bd. of Elections, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 425, 2004-Ohio-3701, 811 N.E.2d 1130, \u00b6 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-6\">{\u00b6 12} Finally, if the pertinent facts are uncontroverted and it appears beyond doubt that Rodak is entitled to the requested writ, we will issue a peremptory writ of procedendo. <em>State ex rel. Highlander v. Rudduck, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 370, 2004-Ohio-4952, 816 N.E.2d 213, \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-7\">Procedendo</p>\n<p id=\"b425-8\">{\u00b6 13} Rodak claims that he is entitled to a writ of procedendo to compel Judge Betleski to rule on his pending motions in his criminal case. \u201c \u2018A writ of procedendo is appropriate when a court has either refused to render a judgment or has unnecessarily delayed proceeding to judgment.\u2019 \u201d <em>State ex rel. R.W. Sidley, Inc. v. Crawford, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 113, 2003-Ohio-5101, 796 N.E.2d 929, \u00b6 16, quoting <em>State ex rel. Weiss v. Hoover </em>(1999), 84 Ohio St.3d 530, 532, 705 N.E.2d 1227.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-9\">{\u00b6 14} \u201c[NJeither procedendo nor mandamus will generally issue to compel a court to release its decisions promptly.\u201d <em>State ex rel. Nalls v. Russo, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 410, 2002-Ohio-4907, 775 N.E.2d 522, \u00b6 31. Consequently, we have denied writs of procedendo and mandamus when the delay is relatively minimal. See id. (relator filed action for extraordinary relief to compel magistrate to issue a separate decision just three days after the entry in the case was journalized); <em>Berthelot v. Dezso </em>(1999), 86 Ohio St.3d 257, 259, 714 N.E.2d 888 (only two to three weeks had elapsed from the time relator requested that judge act on her pending motions until relator filed complaint for writs of mandamus and prohibition); <em>State ex rel. Sherrills v. Cuyahoga Cty. Court of Common Pleas </em>(1995), 72 Ohio St.3d 461, 462, 650 N.E.2d 899 (postconviction-relief petition and motions had been pending for only two to three weeks when complaint for writ of procedendo was filed); <em>State ex rel. Dehler v. Sutula </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 33, 35-36, 656 N.E.2d 332 (mandamus to compel court to rule on postconviction-relief petition that had been pending for ten months, when relator had filed other requests on and after date he filed petition).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>{\u00b6 15} By contrast, most of Rodak\u2019s motions have been pending for more than four years. Only Rodak\u2019s May 2004 motion to dismiss on speedy-trial grounds was filed within the past year.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-5\">{\u00b6 16} Judge Betleski claims that extraordinary relief in procedendo is not available because procedendo cannot control when a particular motion will be ruled upon by a court. But we have consistently held that a writ of procedendo will issue when a court has unnecessarily delayed proceeding to judgment. <em>State ex rel. Bunting v. Haas, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 161, 2004-Ohio-2055, 807 N.E.2d 359, \u00b6 8. In fact, an \u201c \u2018inferior court\u2019s refusal or failure to timely dispose of a pending action is the ill a writ of procedendo is designed to remedy.\u2019 \u201d <em>Dehler, </em>74 Ohio St.3d at 35, 656 N.E.2d 332, quoting <em>State ex rel. Levin v. Sheffield Lake </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 104, 110, 637 N.E.2d 319; <em>State ex rel. Watkins v. Eighth Dist. Court of Appeals </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 532, 534-535, 696 N.E.2d 1079.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-6\">{\u00b6 17} Judge Betleski further notes that in May 2000, Rodak agreed to toll the constitutional and statutory time limitations in his criminal case and that Rodak further agreed to the court\u2019s placing his civil case on the inactive docket pending resolution of his criminal ease.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-7\">{\u00b6 18} Neither of these reasons, however, justifies the delay in ruling on Rodak\u2019s pending motions in his criminal case. Rodak did not consent to Judge Betleski\u2019s not ruling on the pending motions. And the inactive status of Rodak\u2019s civil case does not excuse the failure to promptly rule on pending motions in his criminal case.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-8\">{\u00b6 19} Therefore, Rodak has proven that Judge Betleski has unnecessarily delayed in ruling on his various pending motions in his criminal case. We have granted extraordinary relief when the delay in ruling on pending items has been considerably shorter. <em>State ex rel. Turpin v. Stark Cty. Court of Common Pleas </em>(1966), 8 Ohio St.2d 1, 37 O.O.2d 40, 220 N.E.2d 670 (court failed to rule on petition for postconviction relief that had been pending for 12 months); cf. <em>Bunting, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 161, 2004-Ohio-2055, 807 N.E.2d 359, \u00b6 9 (procedendo is the appropriate remedy to rectify violation of the Crim.R. 35[C] requirement that a court rule on postconvietion-relief petition not later than 180 days after the petition is filed).</p>\n<p id=\"b426-9\">{\u00b6 20} Because the pertinent facts are uncontroverted and from these facts it appears beyond doubt that Rodak is entitled to the requested extraordinary relief, we grant a peremptory writ of procedendo to compel Judge Betleski to rule on pending motions in Rodak\u2019s criminal case. <em>Highlander, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 370, 2004-Ohio-4952, 816 N.E.2d 213, \u00b6 25.</p>\n<p id=\"b426-10\">Writ granted.</p>\n<judges id=\"b426-11\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, F.E.
