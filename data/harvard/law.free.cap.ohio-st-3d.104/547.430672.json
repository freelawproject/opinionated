(\u201cArth\u201d), is a private employer that participates in the State Insurance Fund for workers\u2019 compensation. Arth is merit-rated and, at all times pertinent, was a part of a group-experience rating program sponsored by the Greater Cleveland Growth Association\u2019s Council of Smaller Enterprises (\u201cCOSE\u201d), a trade association of which Arth is a member.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">{\u00b6 2} Arth appeals from a judgment of the Franklin County Court of Appeals affirming the dismissal of Arth\u2019s declaratory-judgment action against appellee James Conrad, the Administrator of Workers\u2019 Compensation. In the declaratory judgment action, Arth contested the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation\u2019s charging of Arth\u2019s employer-risk account for the amounts paid in medical benefits to an injured employee prior to the resolution of Arth\u2019s appeal of the employee\u2019s claim. An employer\u2019s risk account is the bureau\u2019s individualized account of those losses incurred against the State Fund on account of injuries, occupational disease, and death of the employees of that employer.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-10\">{\u00b6 3} This case arises out of a claim filed by Nuncio Ayala, an Arth employee, who requested payments of disability compensation and medical benefits due to bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome he allegedly contracted or sustained in the course of his employment. Following formal hearings, Industrial Commission district and staff hearing officers allowed Ayala\u2019s claim for an occupational disease described as \u201cbilateral carpal tunnel syndrome.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b626-11\">{\u00b6 4} On March 11, 1998, pursuant to R.C. 4123.511(D) and (E), Arth appealed to the Industrial Commission from its staff hearing officer\u2019s decision. The commission refused to hear Arth\u2019s appeal. Thus, Arth appealed the staff hearing officer\u2019s order to the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas, pursuant to R.C. 4123.512(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-12\">{\u00b6 5} While Arth\u2019s action was pending in the trial court, the bureau, between July 1, 1998, and July 1, 1999, made various payments to Ayala\u2019s medical providers totaling $9,395. On July 1, 1999, that amount was charged to Arth\u2019s risk account. Similarly, from July 1, 1999, to July 1, 2000, the bureau made further payments totaling $1,102 to Ayala\u2019s health-care providers, and again <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"549\">*549</page-number>charged that amount to Arth\u2019s risk account. The total amount charged to Arth\u2019s account over two years was $10,497.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">{\u00b6 6} Upon receiving notice that the administrator had imposed those charges against its risk account while its R.C. 4123.512 appeal was pending, Arth filed a formal letter of protest with appellee pursuant to Ohio Adm.Code 4123-17-27 challenging the charges. Arth argued that charges could not be made against its account before a final order allowing Ayala\u2019s claim. The administrator eventually rejected this protest by final order on October 24, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">{\u00b6 7} Based on that final order, Arth filed this declaratory judgment action on December 11, 2000, in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas. The next day, the Cuyahoga County Court of Common Pleas ruled in the underlying case that Ayala was not entitled to any workers\u2019 compensation benefits for his claim. That determination was certified to the Industrial Commission and, in accordance with R.C. 4123.512(E), became the commission\u2019s final order in Ayala\u2019s claim. On February 15, 2001, the bureau credited Arth\u2019s risk account with the $10,497 in medical payments that had been charged to it due to the allowance of Ayala\u2019s claim by the commission\u2019s staff hearing officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">{\u00b6 8} Meanwhile, Arth\u2019s declaratory judgment action continued. Arth argued that an injured worker\u2019s health-care providers cannot lawfully be paid until there has been a final adjudication of the claim as defined by R.C. 126.30(D). Further, Arth argued, an employer\u2019s risk account cannot be charged with the amount paid for medical bills until a final adjudication.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-8\">{\u00b6 9} Arth claimed that appellee\u2019s charging of Ayala\u2019s medical bill payments against its risk account before a final adjudication adversely affected it in two different ways. First, Arth alleged that it was obligated to appellee for more than its true premium obligation in order to maintain individualized State Fund coverage. Arth claims that it paid premium amounts of \u201capproximately $1,000.00 more\u201d for fiscal year 2000 coverage and \u201capproximately $1,273.00\u201d more for fiscal year 2001 coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-9\">{\u00b6 10} Second, Arth alleged that appellee\u2019s action affected its group rating within its group. A State Fund employer can join a group for purposes of calculating the amount of its premium that it must pay to the State Fund. R.C. 4123.29(A)(4). Pursuant to R.C. 4123.29(A)(4), an employer must be affiliated with a qualified sponsor organization to be eligible for group rating. Arth\u2019s sponsoring organization is COSE. A third-party administrator, Integrated Consulting Services (\u201cICS\u201d), administered COSE\u2019s group rating system, assigning member employers into different groups. Two of the groups sponsored by COSE were Manufacturing Group A and Manufacturing Group B.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-10\">{\u00b6 11} Arth claims that it suffered additional adverse premium obligation costs because applying Ayala\u2019s medical charges to Arth\u2019s risk account caused it to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"550\">*550</page-number>improperly moved to a higher cost premium-rate-group-experience rating than it would have without the imposition of the additional charges to its risk account. Prior to the charge of Ayala\u2019s medical payments to Arth\u2019s risk account, Arth was a part of Group A. After the charge to its risk account, Arth was transferred into Group B, a group whose employers paid higher premiums than those in Group A. Arth alleges that it paid additional premiums of $8,956 for policy year 1999 coverage and $9,401 for policy year 2000 group-rating coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">{\u00b6 12} The parties each filed summary judgment motions in the declaratory judgment action, and the trial court granted the bureau\u2019s. The trial court found that R.C. 4123.511(1) determines when medical bills become payable; that R.C. 126.30 does not prevent the bureau from paying medical bills prior to a final adjudication; that the bureau may charge an employer\u2019s risk account in accordance with R.C. 4123.34 during the pendency of an employer\u2019s appeal pursuant to R.C. 4123.512; that the bureau properly credited Arth\u2019s risk account for all amounts that had been charged to it; and that the bureau was not required to make a further credit to Arth\u2019s account, or to otherwise reimburse Arth, due to Arth\u2019s payment of increased premiums.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">{\u00b6 13} Arth appealed the trial court decision to the Franklin County Court of Appeals. On November 19, 2002, the appellate court affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">{\u00b6 14} The cause is before this court upon the acceptance of a discretionary appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">Law and Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b628-9\">{\u00b6 15} We address three issues in this case: (1) At what point in the claims process may the bureau pay a claimant\u2019s medical bills? (2) Once the bureau pays a claimant\u2019s medical bills, when may it charge an employer\u2019s risk account for those payments? and (3) When medical bills are paid on a claim that is ultimately disallowed, to what extent must the bureau credit an employer whose risk account has been improperly charged? We address these issues in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-10\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b628-11\">{\u00b6 16} Central to the issue of when the bureau may properly pay medical benefits to health-care providers on behalf of claimants is whether R.C. 4123.511(1) or 126.30(D) controls. The bureau argues that R.C. 4123.511(1) governs the issue. That statute reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b628-12\">{\u00b6 17} \u201cNo medical benefits payable under this chapter or Chapter 4121., 4127., or 4131. of the Revised Code are payable until the earlier of the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b628-13\">{\u00b6 18} \u201c(1) The date of the issuance of the staff hearing officer\u2019s order under division (D) of this section;</p>\n<p id=\"b628-14\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c(2) The date of the final administrative or judicial determination.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>{\u00b6 20} Here, the bureau paid Ayala\u2019s medical benefits after the issuance of the staff hearing officer\u2019s order.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">{\u00b6 21} Arth argues that the proper time for the payment of medical benefits is set forth in R.C. 126.30(D), which reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">{\u00b6 22} \u201cIn applying this section to invoices submitted to the bureau of workers\u2019 compensation for equipment, materials, goods, supplies, or services provided to employees in connection with an employee\u2019s claim against the state insurance fund, * * * as compensation for injuries or occupational disease pursuant to Chapter 4123., 4127., or 4131. of the Revised Code, the required payment date shall be the date on which payment is due under the terms of a written agreement between the bureau and the provider. If a specific payment date is not established by a written agreement, the required payment date shall be thirty days after the bureau receives a proper invoice for the amount of the payment due or thirty days after the final adjudication allowing payment of an award to the employee, whichever is later. Nothing in this section shall supersede any faster timetable for payments to health care providers contained in sections 4121.44 and 4123.512 of the Revised Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">{\u00b6 23} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b629-8\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cFor purposes of this division, \u2018final adjudication\u2019 means the later of the date of the decision or other action by the bureau, the industrial commission, or a court allowing payment of the award to the employee from which there is no further right to reconsideration or appeal that would require the bureau to withhold compensation and benefits, or the date on which the rights to reconsideration or appeal have expired without an application therefor having been filed or, if later, the date on which an application for reconsideration or appeal is withdrawn.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b629-9\">{\u00b6 25} Arth argues that the bureau should have waited until \u201cfinal adjudication,\u201d i.e., the resolution of Arth\u2019s appeal, before paying the medical benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-10\">{\u00b6 26} R.C. 4123.511(1) speaks for itself, unambiguously establishing the earliest date that the bureau may pay medical bills associated with a workplace injury. It states that medical benefits are payable at the earlier of the date of the issuance of the staff hearing officer\u2019s order or the date of the final administrative or judicial determination. The statute does not say that the bureau <em>must </em>pay medical benefits at \u201c[t]he date of the issuance of the staff hearing officer\u2019s order,\u201d but that it may.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-11\">{\u00b6 27} In the face of such seemingly unequivocal language, what role does R.C. 126.30(D) play? The key is in R.C. 126.30(D)\u2019s first line \u2014 \u201c[i]n applying <em>this section </em>to invoices submitted to the bureau of workers\u2019 compensation.\u201d (Emphasis added.) The \u201csection\u201d referred to is R.C. 126.30, which requires state <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>agencies to pay interest charges for \u201cany equipment, materials, goods, supplies, or services\u201d when they fail to make payment by the required payment date. R.C. 126.30(A). R.C. 126.30(D) applies only to the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation and sets the required payment date for purposes of calculating interest owed\u2014 the bureau must pay interest on payments made after that date.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-5\">{\u00b6 28} Thus, while R.C. 4123.511(1) allows medical benefits to be paid upon a staff hearing officer\u2019s order, medical bills would not be considered overdue and susceptible to the payment of interest until a final adjudication pursuant to R.C. 126.30(D). The statutes thus fit together and are not in conflict with each other. Since the question in this case concerns when the bureau may begin to make medical-benefit payments (as addressed in R.C. 4123.511[I]), and not whether the bureau should have paid any interest on late payments (as addressed in R.C. 126.30[D]), R.C. 4123.511(1) applies. Therefore, the timing of the bureau\u2019s payment of Ayala\u2019s medical benefits was permissible under the law, as the staff hearing officer\u2019s order was issued before March 11,1998, and the bureau made its first payments to Ayala\u2019s medical providers nearly four months later.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b630-7\">{\u00b6 29} The fact that the bureau <em>may </em>make medical-benefit payments under R.C. 4123.511(1) does not necessarily mean that those amounts may be charged immediately to an employer\u2019s risk account. The question becomes who should bear the short-term brunt of the bureau\u2019s decision to pay medical benefits prior to the final adjudication of the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-8\">{\u00b6 30} The bureau points to R.C. 4123.34(A) as authority for immediately charging employer-risk accounts. R.C. 4123.34(A) provides that the administrator \u201cshall keep an accurate account of the * * * money received from each individual employer and the amount of losses incurred against the state insurance fund on account of injuries, occupational disease, and death of the employees of the employer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b630-9\">{\u00b6 31} The statute calls for recordkeeping but falls far short of mandating an immediate charge to an employer\u2019s risk account. Whether a claim on appeal even constitutes a \u201closs\u201d under the statute, rather than a potential loss, is questionable.</p>\n<p id=\"b630-10\">{\u00b6 32} Although the appellate court below also rejected the idea that R.C. 4123.34(A) allows an immediate charge to an employer\u2019s risk account, it found authority for the practice in R.C. 4123.512(H). That statute reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b630-11\">{\u00b6 33} \u201cIf, in a final administrative or judicial action, it is determined that payments of compensation or benefits, or both, made to or on behalf of a claimant should not have been made, the amount thereof shall be charged to the surplus fund under division (B) of section 4123.34 of the Revised Code. In the event the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"553\">*553</page-number>employer is a state risk, the amount shall not be charged to the employer\u2019s experience.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-5\">{\u00b6 34} The court below wrote that \u201cR.C. 4123.511(H) is ambiguous with respect to when the bureau may charge an employer\u2019s risk account for benefit payments made on behalf of a state-fund insured employer\u2019s employee, as two reasonable and equally plausible meanings are conveyed by the language of the statute.\u201d The court of appeals set forth the two interpretations as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b631-6\">{\u00b6 35} \u201cOn the one hand, the bureau argues that the provision provides that where a final administrative or judicial decision determines that benefit payments made by the bureau should not have been made, the amount of such payments[ ] shall be charged to the surplus fund, and where the employer is a state-fund insured employer, credited to the employer\u2019s risk account. On the other hand, Arth argues that the provision provides that where a final administrative or judicial decision determines that benefit payments made by the bureau should not have been made, the amount of such payments shall be charged to the surplus fund, and where the claimant\u2019s employer is a state-fund insured employer, the amount of such payments shall never be charged to the employer\u2019s risk account.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b631-7\">{\u00b6 36} The court wrote that \u201c[i]n choosing between the two interpretations of R.C. 4123.512(H) offered by the parties, we are mindful of the principle that a court must defer to an agency\u2019s reasonable interpretation of a statute within its purview.\u201d The court found the bureau\u2019s interpretation of R.C. 4123.512(H) to be reasonable and thus found that the bureau acted lawfully when it charged the amounts paid for Ayala\u2019s medical payments to Arth\u2019s risk account while Arth\u2019s appeal was pending in the common pleas court.</p>\n<p id=\"b631-8\">{\u00b6 37} We disagree with the court of appeals. Although the bureau\u2019s policy of immediately charging an employer\u2019s risk account may seem reasonable as a way of doing business, or a reasonable accounting procedure, the policy does not result from a reasonable interpretation of R.C. 4123.512(H). The key statement in the statute \u2014 \u201c[i]n the event the employer is a state risk, the amount shall not be charged to the employer\u2019s experience\u201d \u2014 says nothing about crediting an employer\u2019s account. There is no contemplation in the statute that the employer\u2019s experience will have already been charged prior to the resolution of the appeal. The statute sets forth a flat prohibition \u2014 \u201cshall not be charged.\u201d Earlier in the section, corrective measures are discussed: \u201c[i]f * * * it is determined that payments of compensation or benefits * * * should not have been made, the amount thereof should be charged to the surplus fund.\u201d There is no parallel corrective device for charging an employer\u2019s experience. The statute does not say that \u201cif an employer\u2019s experience has been charged, the employer\u2019s experience should be credited.\u201d The statute is not about fixing an error; it is about avoiding the error from the start. R.C. 4123.512(H) clearly requires that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"554\">*554</page-number>decision to impose a charge on experience must follow \u201ca final administrative or judicial action.\u201d R.C. 4123.512(H) does not open the door to an immediate charge to an employer\u2019s risk account; to the contrary, it slams the door shut for such a charge until a final determination. Therefore, the bureau\u2019s immediate charge of Ayala\u2019s medical benefits to Arth\u2019s experience was contrary to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-4\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b632-5\">{\u00b6 38} Finally, we address the extent to which the bureau must credit the account of an employer whose risk account has been improperly charged.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-6\">{\u00b6 39} The bureau\u2019s policy of crediting an employer\u2019s account upon a final determination in the employer\u2019s favor is usually noncontroversial. The parties here seem to agree that the bureau\u2019s crediting the amount of the Ayala medical payments to Arth\u2019s account resolves any issue arising from premium increases not related to Arth\u2019s group rating. The remaining issue is that of the premium increases imposed by COSE and whether Arth is entitled to a credit for the amount of the increases.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-7\">{\u00b6 40} The parties do not dispute that Arth paid higher premiums because of the change in group rating that occurred after the Ayala medical payments were charged to Arth\u2019s experience. However, the bureau argues that it was COSE\u2019s administrator, ICS, that actually made the change in group rating. Thus, the bureau argues, Arth has no recourse against the bureau. Arth contends that the bureau\u2019s refusal to credit the premium increases violates Arth\u2019s right to due process, and that state action existed because the bureau effectively required the increases.</p>\n<p id=\"b632-8\">{\u00b6 41} This court dealt with the public/private issue in the workers\u2019 compensation context in <em>State ex rel. AFL-CIO v. Ohio Bur. of Workers\u2019 Comp., </em>97 Ohio St.3d 504, 2002-Ohio-6717, 780 N.E.2d 981, \u00b6 16-17:</p>\n<p id=\"b632-9\">{\u00b6 42} \u201cThe entanglement of private employers and the state in the administration of Ohio\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation system dates back to the system\u2019s creation and is rooted in the Ohio Constitution and statutory law. Section 35, Article II of the Ohio Constitution allows for the establishment of a workers\u2019 compensation system to be \u2018administered by the state.\u2019 Section 35, Article II states that the compensation awarded thereunder \u2018shall be in lieu of all other rights to compensation, or damages, for * * * death, injuries, or occupational disease, and any employer who pays the premium or compensation provided by law * * * shall not be liable to respond in damages at common law or by statute for such death, injuries or occupational disease.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b632-10\">{\u00b6 43} \u201cBy statute, the state has made employer participation in the workers\u2019 compensation system mandatory, with limited exceptions. R.C. 4123.01(B)(2); R.C. 4123.35. Noncomplying employers are subject to suit brought by the state. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"555\">*555</page-number>R.C. 4123.75. The administrative process for the adjudication of employees\u2019 claims is state-created. Section 35, Article II, Ohio Constitution; R.C. 4121.02 (creating the Industrial Commission); R.C. 4121.121 (creating the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation).\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b633-5\">{\u00b6 44} In <em>AFL-CIO, </em>we addressed the constitutionality of enactments permitting private employers to perform drug tests on any employee claiming a workplace injury. While it was private employers that were performing the drug tests, we found state action because the legislation at issue made the results of those tests, or a refusal to take them, a basis for denying compensation for injuries. Id. at \u00b6 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-6\">{\u00b6 45} Here, COSE\u2019s assignment of Arth into its Group B rating was a mix of state and private action. An administrative rule of the bureau mandated that COSE employ the bureau\u2019s actuarial information in assigning group status to Arth. Ohio Adm.Code 4123-17-64(A) states that \u201c[t]he eligibility of data for use in the group shall be the same as the eligibility of data for use in the individual employer\u2019s rate calculation.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b633-7\">{\u00b6 46} Thus, the rule required COSE to rely on the actuarial data that the bureau provided. Since the bureau charged the amounts of Ayala\u2019s medical-bill payments to Arth\u2019s risk account, COSE was forced to rely on that information in determining Arth\u2019s eligibility for continued membership in Group A.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-8\">{\u00b6 47} Relying on that information, COSE assigned Arth to Group B, which meant that Arth would be forced to pay higher premiums for higher risk coverage. Moreover, Ohio Adm.Code 4123-17-62 prevents a group sponsor from retroactively correcting an error in group assignment. The rule states that \u201c[t]he group may make no changes in the application [for group experience rating] after the last day for filing the application. Any changes received by the bureau after the filing deadline will not be honored.\u201d Ohio Adm.Code 4123-17-62(E).</p>\n<p id=\"b633-9\">{\u00b6 48} The bureau thus requires that mistakes corrected by the courts cannot be corrected within the group-rating system. An employer cannot be reassigned until the close of the year in which it was assigned its present status. Ohio Adm.Code 4123-17-62(A)(3). Moreover, the bureau itself has no mechanism to allow employers to recover amounts of increased premium payments made because of a shift in group assignment.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-10\">{\u00b6 49} Finally, the state was the recipient of the increased premiums paid by Arth.</p>\n<p id=\"b633-11\">{\u00b6 50} Thus, in this case, the bureau has acted contrary to statute by assigning medical payments to an employer\u2019s risk account prior to the final resolution of the case. The bureau required the employer\u2019s group sponsor to consider the employer\u2019s revised risk account prior to assigning it to a group. Arth alleges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"556\">*556</page-number>that as a direct result of the actuarial information the bureau forced the employer\u2019s group to rely on, its group sponsor placed it in a group with higher premiums. Further, the bureau prevented Arth from amending its status until a year passed. Arth thus paid increased premiums, with no process available for reimbursement of the overpayments required to be paid by the acts of the bureau.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-5\">{\u00b6 51} As it stands, Arth has no way of recovering the increased premiums it paid to the bureau because of the bureau\u2019s reliance on illegally calculated and inaccurate data. The bureau has no system in place for the calculation of a refund.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-6\">{\u00b6 52} The bureau\u2019s policy thus fails on constitutional grounds, violating the right to a remedy guaranteed by Section 16, Article I of the Ohio Constitution: \u201cThe right to a remedy guaranteed by Section 16, Article I of the Ohio Constitution \u2018requires an opportunity [for remedial action] granted at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.\u2019 \u201d (Bracketed material sic.) <em>State ex rel. Sysco Food Serv. of Cleveland, Inc. v. Indus. Comm. </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 612, 614, 734 N.E.2d 361, quoting <em>Burgess v. Eli Lilly &amp; Co. </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 59, 62, 609 N.E.2d 140.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-7\">{\u00b6 53} Arth should have the opportunity to prove that the bureau\u2019s charging of the Ayala medical payments was the proximate cause of the increase in group premiums that Arth paid while those medical payments were charged toward its experience. The bureau should be liable to credit Arth only to the extent that the premiums it received exceeded those Arth would have made had the medical benefits not been charged to its risk account.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-8\">{\u00b6 54} We therefore reverse the judgment of the court of appeals and remand the cause to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b634-9\">Judgment reversed and cause remanded.</p>\n<judges id=\"b634-10\">Moyer, C.J., Lundberg Stratton, O\u2019Connor and O\u2019Donnell, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b634-11\">Resnick and F.E.

The issues posed in this action touch the very core of the powers and functions of a state agency charged with administrating a social mechanism for distributing losses in the industrial arena. They involve the basic accounting methods and actuarial standards utilized by the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation and its administrator to spread the risk of loss due to workplace <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"557\">*557</page-number>injury among classes of occupation while ensuring a solvent fund for the payment of compensation and benefits to injured and diseased workers and those who depend on them for support.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-4\">{\u00b6 56} We are dealing here with a premium-related administrative determination formulated by an agency that has accumulated considerable expertise in the area and to whom the General Assembly has delegated the responsibility of implementing and administering the legislative command for an equitable rating system. See, e.g., R.C. 4123.34(C). These are matters in which deference to the bureau\u2019s discretionary authority is paramount and judicial intervention is cautiously restricted to the most flagrant transgressions of administrative power. See <em>State ex rel. Ohio Aluminum Indus., Inc. v. Conrad, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 38, 2002-Ohio-5307, 776 N.E.2d 63, at \u00b6 20; <em>Swallow v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 55, 57, 521 N.E.2d 778. We are not experts in the field, and we have a duty to respect the legitimate policy choice made by the agency entrusted to make such a decision. See <em>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. </em>(1984), 467 U.S. 837, 865-866, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694. See, also, <em>Northwestern Ohio Bldg. &amp; Constr. Trades Council v. Conrad </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 282, 287-288, 750 N.E.2d 130.</p>\n<p id=\"b635-5\">{\u00b6 57} The administrator has chosen to charge the employer\u2019s risk on the survey date for rate setting (July 1 of each year), rather than waiting until after the final adjudication of the claim, because he has determined that it is essential to the premium-rating system to treat the amount of medical benefits paid under R.C. 4123.511(I)(1) as an actual loss to the State Insurance Fund that occurs at the time the payment is made.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Yet there is no clearly discernible statutory or constitutional proscription against this methodology, and the court should be loath to fashion one out of the hodgepodge of overlapping arguments and oblique statutory provisions upon which Arth relies. Nor can such a prohibition be extrapolated from R.C. 4123.512(H), which provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b635-6\">{\u00b6 58} \u201cIf, in a final administrative or judicial action, it is determined that payments of compensation or benefits, or both, made to or on behalf of a claimant should not have been made, the amount thereof shall be charged to the surplus fund under division (B) of section 4123.34 of the Revised Code. In the event the employer is a state risk, the amount shall not be charged to the employer\u2019s experience. In the event the employer is a self-insuring employer, the self-insuring employer shall deduct the amount from the paid compensation the self-insuring employer reports to the administrator under division (L) of section 4123.35 of the Revised Code.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b636-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"558\">*558</page-number>{\u00b6 59} It is true that R.C. 4123.512(H) cannot be interpreted to authorize the bureau to charge the employer\u2019s risk account prior to a final determination and then credit the employer\u2019s account in the event the employer\u2019s appeal is successful. As pointed out by the majority, R.C. 4123.512(H) \u201csays nothing about crediting an employer\u2019s account. * * * The statute does not say that \u2018if an employer\u2019s experience has been charged, the employer\u2019s experience should be credited.\u2019 \u201d Thus, I do not agree with the court of appeals that the bureau has reasonably interpreted R.C. 4123.512(H) as providing authority for its actions in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-5\">{\u00b6 60} However, I disagree with the majority that R.C. 4123.512(H) prohibits the bureau\u2019s methodology in this case. As the majority states, \u201c[tjhere is no contemplation in the statute that the employer\u2019s experience will have already been charged prior to the final resolution of the appeal.\u201d But this does not mean that the bureau is prohibited from charging the employer\u2019s risk before a final determination is made. There is nothing in R.C. 4123.512(H) to indicate that the General Assembly gave deliberate thought to this eventuality and then decided to preclude its occurrence.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-6\">{\u00b6 61} The problem with the majority\u2019s analysis is that it broadly interprets a postappeal provision in order to resolve a preappeal question. R.C. 4123.512(H) essentially provides for what happens after it is finally determined that payments of compensation or benefits made during the pendency of the employer\u2019s appeal should not have been made. It contains three remedial measures: (1) charging the amount to the surplus fund, (2) not charging the amount to the experience of a state-fund employer, and (3) deducting the amount from the self-insured employer\u2019s reporting form. The statute does not, however, purport to govern what happens in the time between the administrative order or event that triggered the payment of compensation or benefits and the final determination that reverses the award.</p>\n<p id=\"b636-7\">{\u00b6 62} Contrary to the majority\u2019s interpretation, R.C. 4123.512(H) does not clearly require that \u201cthe decision to impose a charge on experience must follow \u2018a final administrative or judicial action.\u2019 \u201d That is not how the statute is worded. It does not say that \u201cthe amount shall not be charged to the employer\u2019s experience prior to a final administrative or judicial action.\u201d Nor does the statute specify that the bureau must wait until after a final determination of the claim to charge the employer\u2019s experience. It simply provides that \u201c[i]f * * * it is [finally] determined that payments * * * should not have been made, * * * the amount shall not be charged to the employer\u2019s experience,\u201d which neither authorizes nor prohibits the imposition of a charge on the employer\u2019s experience prior to the final determination. It is only by way of reconstructing the syntax of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"559\">*559</page-number>R.C. 4123.512(H) that the majority is able to interpret this provision to preclude the bureau\u2019s policy in this case.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"A-A\">Willacy, LoPresti &amp; Marcovy, Aubrey B.

Sweeney, J., concurs in the foregoing dissenting opinion.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b635-7\">. If it is finally determined that the claimant is not entitled to participate in the fund, or is not entitled to the benefits received or paid on his or her behalf, the administrator then credits the employer\u2019s risk account for the full amount that was previously charged to its experience.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
