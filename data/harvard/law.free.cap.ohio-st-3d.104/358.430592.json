We find one proposition to be meritorious and reverse Gapen\u2019s convictions for breaking detention and the R.C. 2929.04(A)(4) specifications that allege murder in the course of breaking detention. We find that none of his other propositions of law has merit and affirm Gapen\u2019s remaining convictions. We have also independently weighed the aggravating circumstances against the mitigating factors and have compared Gapen\u2019s sentence of death to those imposed in similar cases, as R.C. 2929.05(A) requires. As a result, we affirm Gapen\u2019s sentence of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-11\">{\u00b6 2} Larry James Gapen was distraught over the recent dissolution of his marriage to Martha Madewell. Around 1:00 a.m. on September 18, 2000, Gapen entered Madewell\u2019s home in Dayton. Gapen found Madewell and Nathan Marshall, a former husband of Madewell, lying on a couch. Gapen killed them by repeatedly striking them with a maul. Gapen then went upstairs and struck 13-year-old Jesica Young with the maul as she slept in her bed. Jesica later died of her injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-12\">{\u00b6 3} Gapen was convicted of the aggravated murders of Madewell, Marshall, and Jesica and was sentenced to death for Jesica\u2019s murder. To establish Gapen\u2019s guilt, the state introduced Gapen\u2019s statements to the police, DNA evidence that Gapen\u2019s sperm was found on Madewell\u2019s right leg, abdomen, and rectum, testimony from two children in the house at the time of the murders, and evidence that Madewell\u2019s purse was found in Gapen\u2019s car at the time of his arrest.</p>\n<p id=\"b436-13\">\n<em>State\u2019s Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b436-14\">{\u00b6 4} During the fall of 1999, Gapen and Madewell separated, and Gapen and his son, Jimmy, moved out of the family home in Huber Heights. In March 2000, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>Gapen and Jimmy moved to the apartment of Charity, his daughter, who lived on Brusman Drive in Vandalia. Around June or July 2000, Madewell and her children, Jesica Young, Daniel Marshall, Billy Madewell, and Brooke Madewell, moved to Pheasant Hill Road in Dayton.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-4\">{\u00b6 5} On July 5, 2000, Gapen was indicted for the abduction of Madewell. According to Gapen, this incident occurred because he \u201cwanted to talk to [Madewell] one time about the whole situation,\u201d and \u201che was afraid she would just walk out on him so he tied her legs up so she couldn\u2019t leave.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-5\">{\u00b6 6} Two days before, Gapen had been released from jail on a cash bond of $10,000 and under supervision from an electronic home-detention program (\u201cEHDP\u201d). On July 3, 2000, Gapen received an ankle bracelet and started electronic home detention at his daughter\u2019s apartment. On July 19, 2000, Gapen was granted work-release privileges to continue working as a truck driver for Federal Express.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-6\">{\u00b6 7} During August and September, Gapen remained in contact with Made-well. Gapen took Madewell and her children to the Ohio State Fair in August 2000 and attended a cookout at Madewell\u2019s home over the Labor Day weekend, both violations of his home detention, and Madewell visited Gapen at his residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b437-7\">{\u00b6 8} On September 14, 2000, the marriage of Gapen and Madewell was dissolved. At dinner on Saturday, September 16, Gapen told Heather Morgan, a friend, that he was divorced but indicated that he did not want to discuss the matter. He was wearing his wedding ring. Gapen expressed hope that \u201cafter Martha had been out for a while * * * she would see that [he] was really a good thing for her and * * * they could get back together.\u201d Around 3:00 p.m. on Sunday, September 17, Gapen mentioned to Morgan on the telephone that he still loved Madewell, did not understand why Madewell \u201cdidn\u2019t want to talk\u201d with him, and felt \u201cshe had someone else in her life.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-8\">{\u00b6 9} According to Gapen, around 7:30 p.m. on September 17, he drove to Madewell\u2019s home, entered through an unlocked back door, and announced his presence. After failing to get a response, Gapen walked through the residence and saw Madewell and an unknown man lying on a couch. Gapen said, \u201cI didn\u2019t let them know I was there\u201d and \u201cI just walked out the same way I came in.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b437-9\">{\u00b6 10} Around 8 or 9 p.m. on September 17, Gapen met Jimmy, his son, and Kacee Miller, Jimmy\u2019s girlfriend, at a Huber Heights restaurant. Gapen was sitting at the bar drinking a \u201cbeer and a shot of something.\u201d According to Miller, Gapen talked about Madewell and mentioned that \u201che knew that Martha had a boyfriend, but he was okay with it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b438-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>{\u00b6 11} Gapen returned to Madewell\u2019s home around 12:30 a.m. on September 18, parked behind the garage, and entered through the unlocked back door. He brought a maul (also referred to as an \u201caxe-maul\u201d) and a pair of work gloves with him. Gapen found Madewell and Marshall \u201cpassed out on the couch\u201d in the basement. Gapen then repeatedly struck Madewell and Marshall with the maul, and after he finished hitting them, he \u201chad sex with Martha.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b438-5\">{\u00b6 12} At this time, eight-year-old Brooke was sleeping in a basement bedroom and was awakened by loud banging noises and her mother\u2019s cries. Brooke opened her bedroom door and saw a man with \u201ca long stick that looked like an axe.\u201d Brooke then saw that Gapen was holding the \u201caxe\u201d and was hitting \u201csomething.\u201d When Gapen saw Brooke, he told her, \u201cGo back to bed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b438-6\">{\u00b6 13} After this attack, Gapen went to the second-floor bedroom of Jesica. While she was asleep, Gapen struck Jesica repeatedly with the maul. Before leaving the upstairs, Gapen found seven-year-old Billy sleeping in'the master bedroom. Gapen woke up Billy, took him to his car, and put him in the back seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-7\">{\u00b6 14} Gapen then returned to the basement and told Brooke to get dressed because her mother had called him to take her and Billy to school, as she needed a rest. Before leaving, Brooke went upstairs to see Jesica. As Brooke approached Jesica\u2019s room, Gapen told her, \u201cDon\u2019t go in there.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b438-8\">{\u00b6 15} Daniel, age 17, woke up at 1:51 a.m. after hearing Jesica\u2019s cries from her adjoining bedroom. While Gapen was on the second floor, Daniel opened his bedroom door, and Gapen was standing in front of it. Gapen told Daniel that his mother \u201cwas taking care of [his] sister. She\u2019d gotten in some trouble in her room, and he was sorry for waking [him] up.\u201d Gapen told Daniel to \u201cgo back to sleep,\u201d and Daniel returned to bed.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-9\">{\u00b6 16} Gapen then left the house with Brooke. They walked to Gapen\u2019s car, and Brooke got into the back seat with Billy. Gapen went back inside and changed into clean clothes that he had brought with him. Gapen then returned to the car and drove off with the two children.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-10\">{\u00b6 17} After Gapen left, Daniel went to the basement to check on Brooke and discovered the bodies of Madewell and Marshall. Daniel then went upstairs to check on Jesica and found her \u201claying there with her face * * * split open, teeth * * * knocked out, [and] her braces were sticking out of her mouth. * * * [S]he was trying to talk * * * but it just wasn\u2019t coming out.\u201d Daniel also discovered that Brooke and Billy were gone. Daniel notified the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b438-11\">{\u00b6 18} Police and emergency medical personnel responding to the 911 call entered Madewell\u2019s home and found Jesica\u2019s battered body upstairs. Jesica was still alive and was rushed to a hospital, where she later died.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>{\u00b6 19} Pohce then found Madewell\u2019s and Marshall\u2019s bodies in the basement. Madewell was lying on her back underneath a coffee table. Two blankets covered her entire body up to her neck, and a rug had been placed below her face. Madewell\u2019s shirt and bra had been pulled up above her chest. Otherwise, Madewell\u2019s body was nude, and her legs had been spread apart. Police found Marshall\u2019s body lying on the couch with a blanket over the top half of his body.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-4\">{\u00b6 20} Police secured the crime scene and collected evidence from Madewell\u2019s home. Police found a glove at the end of the basement couch that had hair intertwined in it. The matching glove was found in the kitchen.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-5\">{\u00b6 21} In Jesica\u2019s room, police found Jesica\u2019s bed, comforter, and sheets covered in blood. Five teeth were found in the folds of the bed sheets and on the floor. There were also multiple areas of \u201cslow to medium velocity\u201d blood spatter along the wall. Dayton Detective Gary Dunsky testified that the velocity of the spattering was consistent with the use of a maul or hammer to strike the victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-6\">{\u00b6 22} Police found a \u201csplitting maul\u201d in the upstairs bathroom next to Jesica\u2019s room. The steel part of the maul was \u201ccovered completely\u201d with blood.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-7\">{\u00b623} The police quickly determined that Gapen was their primary suspect and broadcast his name and description, as well as information about the missing children, to law enforcement agencies. For several hours after fleeing the scene, Gapen drove around the Dayton area with the two children. Gapen disposed of his bloody clothing along Interstate 75.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-8\">{\u00b624} Around 7:00 a.m. on September 18, Deputy U.S. Marshal Michael Penland identified Gapen and the two children when Gapen showed up at his Brusman Drive residence. Shortly thereafter, Deputy Penland and Vandalia Patrolman Rodney Millhouse arrested Gapen. The two children were released unharmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b439-9\">{\u00b6 25} During his arrest, Gapen said, \u201cI know what this is about, just take care of the kids.\u201d Once in the police cruiser, Gapen said to Officer Millhouse, \u201cI know what you are doing. I just wanted you to know that the kids were in the car.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b439-10\">{\u00b6 26} Around 8:30 a.m. on September 18, Dayton Detectives Mark Salyer and William Elzholz advised Gapen of his <em>Miranda </em>rights and interviewed him. Gapen provided a detailed confession, which reflected the facts already described. In explaining his actions, Gapen said, \u201cThis has been building and building for months.\u201d Madewell had been \u201cplaying him,\u201d and he \u201cwasn\u2019t going to take it anymore.\u201d Gapen said he was \u201cnot sorry\u201d for what he had done, and this was the best he had felt in weeks. According to Gapen, he felt as if a weight had been lifted from him, and \u201cthey were not going to hurt anyone any more.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b439-11\">{\u00b6 27} During his confession, Gapen indicated that he did not know Marshall\u2019s identity before killing him. When asked why he killed Jesica, Gapen said that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>\u201cJesica had always disrespected him and that she would talk back to him. She would smoke in the house, drink in the house, and * * * never give him any respect * * Gapen then said, \u201cShe was going to turn out just like them.\u201d When asked why he did not attack Daniel, Gapen said, \u201cDanny doesn\u2019t know how lucky he is.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-5\">{\u00b6 28} On September 21, the police searched Gapen\u2019s car and found Madewell\u2019s purse on the front passenger seat. The purse contained numerous items, including Madewell\u2019s credit cards, her paycheck, a child-support check, and 35 cents in change. Additionally, a copy of the dissolution decree of Gapen and Madewell\u2019s marriage was on the front passenger seat.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-6\">{\u00b6 29} Dr. Kent Harshbarger, Deputy Coroner for Montgomery County, performed autopsies on the three victims. Jesica suffered 17 chop wounds, five blunt-force injuries on her chest and chin, eight blunt-force injuries on her upper extremities, and two blunt-force injuries on her legs. Some of Jesica\u2019s teeth and fragments of her braces were recovered from her stomach. Dr. Harshbarger concluded that Jesica had died from \u201cmultiple chop injuries of the head and chest.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-7\">{\u00b6 30} Madewell, who was 37 years old, received \u201cat least ten chop wounds.\u201d According to Dr. Harshbarger, Madewell\u2019s cause of death was \u201cmultiple chop wounds of the head.\u201d She died a \u201clittle before two o\u2019clock in the morning\u201d on September 18. Dr. Harshbarger also testified that Madewell\u2019s bra was \u201ctorn at the clasp, and * * * the fabric at the seam was * * * torn as well.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b440-8\">{\u00b6 31} Marshall suffered 18 chop wounds, including two defensive wounds on his right arm, and he died as the result of \u201c[mjultiple chop injuries of the head.\u201d Finally, Dr. Harshbarger concluded that the maul found at the crime scene could have caused the wounds suffered by all three victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-9\">{\u00b6 32} At trial, David Smith, a serologist and DNA analyst, testified that DNA testing of blood samples from the maul showed a \u201cmixture.\u201d However, a major component of the mixture was blood \u201cconsistent with that of Jesica Young.\u201d Additionally, DNA testing of a blood sample from the external portion of the left-handed work glove \u201cwas a mixture. The major component was consistent with that of Martha Madewell.\u201d However, \u201cJesica Young could not be excluded as a contributor to the minor component.\u201d DNA testing of the left-glove liner \u201cwas a mixture again. Larry Gapen could not be excluded as a possible donor to this mixture.\u201d Finally, DNA testing of the right glove indicated that Madewell or Young could be contributors.</p>\n<p id=\"b440-10\">{\u00b6 33} Smith also testified that DNA testing of a rectal sample taken from Madewell was a \u201cmixture,\u201d but the major component was from Larry Gapen. Microscopic analysis of a swab sample obtained from Madewell\u2019s right leg revealed the presence of sperm. Additionally, both chemical and microscopic <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>analysis of swab samples obtained from Madewell\u2019s abdomen showed the presence of sperm. DNA testing of the sperm showed that \u201cthe DNA profile obtained from the right leg and the abdomen were consistent with that of Larry Gapen.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b441-5\">\n<em>Defense Case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b441-6\">{\u00b6 34} Linda Shipley and Jonathan Boeckman, Montgomery County pretrial services employees, obtained information about Gapen\u2019s background in preparing a bond recommendation on the abduction charge. Gapen reported to Shipley that he had not been diagnosed with any mental health problems, had never taken any psychotropic drugs, and had used alcohol socially. Boeckman verified that the abduction charge was Gapen\u2019s first arrest, and he had no prior criminal record.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-7\">{\u00b6 35} Charity Gapen, the defendant\u2019s then 22-year-old daughter, testified that Madewell called Gapen after he was placed on electronic home detention in July 2000. After the first two weeks of home detention, Gapen and Madewell began talking daily, and Madewell \u201cstarted coming to [the] apartment and seeing him * * * and from there, he would go and see her.\u201d Madewell and Gapen also ate out together. During this period, Gapen started to \u201cdrink more at home.\u201d During mid-September, Gapen mentioned that he hoped to work out his problems with Madewell, and even after the dissolution, he \u201choped that they at some time would get back together.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b441-8\">{\u00b6 36} Jimmy Gapen testified that Gapen seemed \u201creally upset\u201d and was \u201creally worried about something\u201d on the morning of September 17. However, when Jimmy and his girlfriend had dinner with Gapen at 8:00 p.m., Gapen \u201cseemed very happy.\u201d During the early morning hours of September 18, Gapen woke Jimmy up and told him that he was \u201cin trouble with the police and * * * was going to go away for a while.\u201d During cross-examination, Jimmy confirmed that Gapen had a maul to chop wood when the family lived in Huber Heights.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-9\">{\u00b6 37} Patrick Mulligan, Gapen\u2019s defense attorney for the abduction offenses, testified that Gapen had been charged with abduction and a misdemeanor charge of domestic violence for the June 24, 2000 incident involving Madewell. According to Mulligan, the abduction charge was still pending, and the domestic-violence charge was pending on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b441-10\">{\u00b6 38} Steven Menard, a friend and fellow coach on youth baseball and football teams, characterized Gapen\u2019s relationship with Madewell as \u201con-again, off-again.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b441-11\">\n<em>Trial Result</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b441-12\">{\u00b6 39} Gapen was charged with 12 counts of aggravated murder and four related felonies. Despite pleas of not guilty, Gapen was found guilty of all <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>charges except rape. He was sentenced to death for Jesica\u2019s murder.

Arizona </em>(1966), 384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694, after he invoked his right to silence and his right to counsel. The trial court overruled the defense motion to suppress and admitted, excluding a few statements, Gapen\u2019s confession into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-15\">{\u00b6 42} During the suppression hearing, Vandalia police officer Millhouse testified that around 8:00 a.m. on -September 18, he drove Gapen to the Dayton police station in his cruiser. Although Millhouse did not question Gapen on the way to the station, Gapen said that he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to talk about anything.\u201d Millhouse did not tell detectives at the police station that Gapen had said that he did not want to talk.</p>\n<p id=\"b443-16\">{\u00b6 43} Around 8:30 a.m., Detectives Mark Salyer and William Elzholz interviewed Gapen. Detective Salyer advised Gapen of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, using a preinterview form. Gapen acknowledged his rights by placing his initials next to each of his rights on the form, but he refused to sign the form. Gapen then said, \u201cI prefer not to say anything at this time. Maybe later. I have a lawyer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b443-17\">{\u00b6 44} After Gapen invoked his Fifth Amendment rights, Detectives Salyer and Elzholz stood up and prepared to leave the interview room. Gapen then said, \u201cCan I ask you guys a question?\u201d Detective Salyer said, \u201cYeah,\u201d and Gapen asked, \u201cAre the kids being taken care of, especially the little girl?\u201d Detective Salyer replied, \u201cAs far as I know, they\u2019re being taken care of, but is there a reason we should know about the girl? Is there some reason * * * she may need help?\u201d Gapen then said, \u201cIt was pretty bad over there. I don\u2019t know what she saw or what she heard. It was real bad over there.\u201d Without being asked any further questions, Gapen said, \u2018You don\u2019t know the whole story. This did not happen just over one night. This has been building and building for months.\u201d Without further prompting, Gapen kept talking and provided a detailed oral statement confessing to the murders of Madewell and Marshall.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>{\u00b6 45} After Gapen\u2019s initial confession, Detective Elzhoz said, \u201cLarry I\u2019d like to ask you something, and you certainly don\u2019t have to answer if you don\u2019t want to. You know, it\u2019s entirely up to you.\u201d Gapen replied, \u201cI won\u2019t answer anything if I don\u2019t want to.\u201d Detective Elzholz then asked, \u201cDid you leave her like that?\u201d Gapen then described how he had beaten Madewell with the maul and then had had sex with her.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-5\">{\u00b6 46} As the interview progressed, Detective Salyer asked Gapen three or four questions, and Detective Elzholz asked him \u201cfour questions total.\u201d In response to these questions, Gapen explained his reasons for attacking Young, admitted bringing the maul and work gloves from his house to the murder scene, and provided other details about the murders.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-6\">{\u00b6 47} Following one question, Gapen said, \u201cAll I wanted to do was find out how the kids were doing. Look where I\u2019m at now because I\u2019ve told you everything. I know my freedom\u2019s over, * * * [b]ut I\u2019m not sorry about this. I haven\u2019t felt this well * * * in weeks.\u201d At the end of the interview, Gapen shook hands with the detectives, and said, \u201cI want to thank you for the way you treated me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b444-7\">{\u00b6 48} The facts show that Gapen\u2019s police statements were not obtained in violation of his <em>Miranda </em>rights. First, Gapen\u2019s confession was not improperly obtained simply because he told Officer Millwood that he \u201cdidn\u2019t want to talk about anything\u201d while being transported in a cruiser to the police station. At most, Gapen\u2019s statement was an anticipatory assertion of his rights because he was not being interrogated when he made this comment.</p>\n<p id=\"b444-8\">{\u00b6 49} Federal courts have held that <em>Miranda </em>rights may not be anticipatorily asserted but may only be invoked in the context of custodial interrogation. See <em>United States v. LaGrone </em>(C.A.7, 1994), 43 F.3d 332, 339 (\u201cin order for a defendant to invoke his <em>Miranda </em>rights the authorities must be conducting interrogation, or interrogation must be imminent\u201d); <em>Alston v. Redman </em>(C.A.3, 1994), 34 F.3d 1237, 1246 (\u201cTo allow an individual to interpose <em>Miranda </em>[requirements] in a situation outside the custodial interrogation context would represent an unwarranted extension of <em>Miranda\u2019s </em>procedural safeguards * * *\u201d); <em>United States v. Grimes </em>(C.A.11, 1998), 142 F.3d 1342, 1348 <em>(\u201cMiranda </em>rights may be invoked only during custodial interrogation or when interrogation is imminent\u201d). The United States Supreme Court has not squarely addressed this issue. But, see, <em>McNeil v. Wisconsin </em>(1991), 501 U.S. 171, 182, 111 S.Ct. 2204, 115 L.Ed.2d 158, fn. 3: \u201cMost rights must be asserted when the government seeks to take the action they protect against. The fact that we have allowed the <em>Miranda </em>right to counsel, once asserted, to be effective with respect to future custodial interrogation does not necessarily mean that we will allow it to be asserted initially outside the context of custodial interrogation, with similar future effect.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b445-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>{\u00b6 50} The reasons for not recognizing an anticipatory assertion of <em>Miranda </em>rights are persuasive. As stated in <em>LaGrone, </em>43 F.3d at 339-340, the requirement that a defendant must invoke his <em>Miranda </em>rights when the police are conducting an interrogation or interrogation is imminent \u201cadvances the twin goals of <em>Miranda: </em>providing an opportunity for the defendant to dissipate the compulsion and allowing law enforcement the ability to conduct investigations.\u201d Moreover, prohibiting a defendant from invoking his <em>Miranda </em>rights anticipatorily \u201cdoes not place an arduous burden on the defendant \u2014 all he needs to do is invoke his right in response to or just before interrogation.\u201d Based on this authority and reasoning, we find that Gapen did not invoke his <em>Miranda </em>right to remain silent while riding in the back of the police cruiser.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">{\u00b6 51} Second, the police did not improperly obtain Gapen\u2019s confession during questioning, because Gapen initiated further discussion about the crime after invoking his <em>Miranda </em>rights. Under <em>Edwards v. Arizona </em>(1981), 451 U.S. 477, 485, 101 S.Ct. 1880, 68 L.Ed.2d 378, once Gapen asserted his <em>Miranda </em>rights, no further interrogation was permissible unless Gapen himself initiated \u201cfurther communication, exchanges, or conversations with the police.\u201d Gapen initiated further conversation by asking the detectives before they left the interview room, \u201cCan I ask you guys a question?\u201d and \u201cAre the kids being taken care of, especially the little girl?\u201d Here, the police did not prompt Gapen to continue talking to them about the crime. Rather, Gapen \u201cevinced a willingness and a desire\u201d to talk further about the crime and its effect upon the well-being of Brooke Madewell. <em>Oregon v. Bradshaw </em>(1983), 462 U.S. 1039, 1045-1046, 103 S.Ct. 2830, 77 L.Ed.2d 405; cf. <em>Jacobs v. Singletary </em>(C.A.11,1992), 952 F.2d 1282, 1294 (suspect did not initiate questioning by asking, \u201cWhere are my children?\u201d). Under these circumstances, we find no <em>Miranda </em>violation.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">{\u00b6 52} Although Gapen initiated the conversation, Detectives Salyer and Elzholz asked several follow-up questions about the murders. Thus, it is necessary to determine whether Gapen thereafter waived his Fifth Amendment rights. Such a waiver must be knowing and intelligent and found to be so under the \u201ctotality of the circumstances, including the necessary fact that the accused, not the police, reopened the dialogue with the authorities.\u201d <em>Edwards, </em>451 U.S. at 486, 101 S.Ct. 1880, 68 L.Ed.2d 378, fn. 9; see, also, <em>United States v. Ware </em>(C.A.6, 2003), 338 F.3d 476, 481.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-8\">{\u00b6 53} No evidence of police coercion, threats, or promises was introduced during the suppression hearing. Indeed, Detective Elzholz reminded Gapen that he did not have to answer any of his questions before asking him the first followup question. In responding \u201cI won\u2019t answer anything if I don\u2019t want to,\u201d Gapen acknowledged that he understood his rights and was knowingly waiving his rights and proceeding with the police interview. Moreover, Gapen, who was 52 years <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>old, was mentally alert and did not appear to be under the influence of alcohol at the time of the interview. Thus, the evidence supports the finding that \u201c[ujnder the totality of the circumstances,\u201d Gapen validly waived his rights. <em>State v. Nields </em>(2001), 93 Ohio St.3d 6, 15, 752 N.E.2d 859; see, also, <em>State v. Jones </em>(2000), 90 Ohio St.3d 403, 413, 739 N.E.2d 300.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">{\u00b6 54} Even if the trial court improperly admitted Gapen\u2019s confession, we find that any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Here, Brooke\u2019s and Daniel\u2019s eyewitness testimony, DNA evidence linking Gapen to the murder victims, and Madewell\u2019s purse and other evidence seized from Gapen\u2019s car unquestionably established Gapen\u2019s guilt. Additionally, Gapen blurted out when he was arrested, \u201cI know what this is about, just take care of the kids.\u201d After being placed in the cruiser, he also said, \u201cI know what you are doing. I just wanted you to know that the kids were in the car.\u201d Police were not questioning Gapen at the time of either of these statements, and the admissibility of these volunteered admissions was not affected by any issue relating to the confession. <em>Arizona v. Fulminante </em>(1991), 499 U.S. 279, 295, 111 S.Ct. 1246, 113 L.Ed.2d 302; <em>State v. Brown </em>(1992) 65 Ohio St.3d 483, 485, 605 N.E.2d 46. Thus, we overrule proposition VII.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">\n<em>Trial Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b446-7\">{\u00b6 55} <em>Sufficiency of the death-penalty specifications and escape charye. </em>In proposition of law IV, Gapen argues that his violation of electronic home monitoring imposed as a condition of his bond does not violate either R.C. 2921.34 for breaking detention or the R.C. 2929.04(A)(4) death specifications for committing murder after breaking detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">{\u00b6 56} Following his arrest for abducting Madewell, Gapen was released from jail on his own recognizance on the condition of monitoring under the electronic-home-detention program (\u201cEHDP\u201d). He was fitted with an ankle transmitter, a monitoring device was installed on his telephone, and he began electronic home detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-10\">{\u00b6 57} On July 19, 2000, Gapen was granted work-release privileges. Beginning on July 27, 2000, Gapen was scheduled to work from 6 p.m. to 7 a.m., Monday through Friday, and from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Saturday. Gapen was not allowed to go anywhere except work or home.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-11\">{\u00b6 58} At 12:30 a.m. on September 18, Gapen violated EHDP when he went to Madewell\u2019s condominium and committed the three murders.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-12\">{\u00b6 59} At the completion of the state\u2019s case, the trial court overruled a defense Crim.R. 29 motion for an acquittal on the breaking-detention charge and the R.C. 2929.04(A)(4) specifications. Over defense objection, the trial court instructed the jury that \u201c[electronically monitored home detention is a form of constraint that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>includes detention. Detention facility means any public or private place used for confinement of a person charged or convicted with any crime in this state or any other state or under the laws of the United States.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-5\">{\u00b6 60} R.C. 2921.34(A)(1), the escape statute, provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b447-6\">{\u00b6 61} \u201cNo person, knowing the person is under detention * * * shall purposely break or attempt to break the detention, or purposely fail to return to detention * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b447-7\">{\u00b6 62} R.C. 2929.04(A)(4), the relevant death-penalty specification, states, \u201cThe offense [of aggravated murder] was committed while the offender was under detention or while the offender was at large after having broken detention. As used in division (A)(4) of this section, \u2018detention\u2019 has the same meaning as in section 2921.01 of the Revised Code * *</p>\n<p id=\"b447-8\">{\u00b6 63} R.C. 2921.01(E) defines detention:</p>\n<p id=\"b447-9\">{\u00b6 64} \u201c \u2018Detention\u2019 means arrest; confinement in any vehicle subsequent to an arrest; confinement in any public or private facility for custody of persons charged with or convicted of crime in this state or another state or under the laws of the United States * *</p>\n<p id=\"b447-10\">{\u00b6 65} Although electronic home monitoring is not included within the definition of detention, the state argues that pretrial electronic home monitoring is detention because detention includes confinement in any \u201cprivate facility for custody of persons charged with * * * crime.\u201d For the following reasons, we reject this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-11\">{\u00b6 66} First, the statutory history of R.C. 2921.01(E) indicates that the General Assembly did not intend to include pretrial electronic home monitoring in the definition of detention. For example, a former version of R.C. 2921.01(E), effective on July 1, 1996, specifically defined pretrial electronic home monitoring as a form of detention. See Am.Sub.S.B. No. 2, 146 Ohio Laws, Part TV, 7136, 7335. However, R.C. 2921.01(E) was amended, effective October 4, 1996, and the General Assembly deleted the reference to electronic home monitoring from the definition of detention. See Sub.H.B. No. 154, 146 Ohio Laws, Part II, 2213, 2214.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-12\">{\u00b6 67} Second, electronic home monitoring was separately defined in Ohio\u2019s sentencing statute. Former R.C. 2929.23, Am.Sub.H.B. No. 22, 148 Ohio Laws, Part IV, 8353, 8383-8384, in effect on the day of the murders, see Am.Sub.H.B. No. 490, stated, \u201c \u2018Electronically monitored house arrest\u2019 means a period of confinement of an eligible offender in the eligible offender\u2019s home or in other premises specified by the sentencing court * * R.C. 2929.23(A)(4). An \u201c[e]ligible offender\u201d was defined as a \u201cperson who has been <em>convicted of or pleaded guilty to any offense\u201d </em>excluding exceptions not applicable here. (Empha<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"370\">*370</page-number>sis added.) R.C. 2929.23(A)(3). Thus, \u201c[fjormer R.C. 2929.23 focused on those serving terms of incarceration and did not apply to those on electronic monitoring as a condition of bail under Crim.R. 46.\u201d See <em>State v. Sutton, </em>Lucas App. No. L-03-1104, 2004-Ohio-2679, 2004 WL 1171149, \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">{\u00b6 68} Third, Ohio courts of appeals have generally held that persons under <em>-pretrial </em>electronic home monitoring are not entitled to credit for time served, because pretrial electronic home monitoring is a \u201cconstraint in lieu of bail pursuant to R.C. 2967.191\u201d and is not detention under R.C. 2921.01(E). See <em>State v. Faulkner </em>(1995) 102 Ohio App.3d 602, 604, 657 N.E.2d 602; <em>State v. Studer </em>(Mar. 5, 2001), Stark App. No. 2000CA00180, 2001 WL 246416, * 2; <em>Bailey v. Chance </em>(Sept. 18, 1998), Mahoning App. No. 98 CA 169, 1998 WL 666965, * 3; <em>State v. Setting </em>(Mar. 20,1996), Wayne App. No. 95CA0057,1996 WL 122094, * 3. Similarly, Ohio courts of appeals have held that persons under <em>pretrial </em>electronic home monitoring are not entitled to credit for speedy-trial purposes because pretrial electronic home monitoring does not constitute detention. <em>State v. Truesdale </em>(Dec. 15, 1995), Montgomery App. No. 15174, 1995 WL 738418, * 2; <em>State v. Brownlow </em>(1991), 75 Ohio App.3d 88, 92, 598 N.E.2d 888.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">{\u00b6 69} Recently, an appellate court has held that a person cannot be convicted of escape for violating <em>pretrial </em>electronic home monitoring. <em>Sutton, </em>Lucas App. No. L-03-1104, 2004-Ohio-2679, \u00b6 17. The court\u2019s rationale was based on the fact that pretrial electronic home monitoring was not detention, but a condition of bond, and \u201c[without detention, one cannot be convicted of escape.\u201d The court also stated that this decision \u201clogically followfs] from treatment of pre-trial electronic monitoring for the purposes of credit for time served and speedy trial.\u201d Id. Contra <em>State v. West </em>(Aug. 21, 1998), Montgomery App. No. 16888, 1998 WL 639290, * 2 (holding that pretrial electronic monitoring is a form of detention for purposes of the crime of escape).</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">{\u00b6 70} The state claims that <em>State v. Snowder </em>(1999), 87 Ohio St.3d 335, 720 N.E.2d 909, justifies sustaining Gapen\u2019s convictions. Snowder\u2019s conviction for escape from a community-based correctional facility (\u201cCBCF\u201d) was upheld even though he did not receive credit for time served at the CBCF. However, <em>Snowder </em>is inapposite. Snowder was a <em>sentenced </em>prisoner serving time at the CBCF as a condition of probation, not pretrial release. Thus, unlike Gapen, Snowder could be found guilty of escaping detention.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-8\">{\u00b6 71} Finally, our recent ruling in <em>State v. Thompson, </em>102 Ohio St.3d 287, 2004-Ohio-2946, 809 N.E.2d 1134, does not apply to the facts in this case. <em>Thompson </em>addressed the issue of whether a parole violator could be charged with escape under R.C. 2921.34. That decision dealt with a statutory change to R.C. 2921.01(E) and had nothing to do with electronic home monitoring.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-5\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"371\">*371</page-number>{\u00b6 72} In sum, we find that pretrial electronic home monitoring was not intended to be a form of detention under R.C. 2921.01(E). Thus, we hold that pretrial electronic home monitoring does not constitute detention for the purpose of prosecuting the crime of escape, nor does it satisfy the requirements of proof in R.C. 2929.04(A)(4).</p>\n<p id=\"b449-6\">{\u00b6 73} We find that proposition IV has merit. Accordingly, Gapen\u2019s conviction for escape and the guilty findings on the R.C. 2929.04(A)(4) specifications are vacated. The charge and specifications are dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-7\">{\u00b6 74} <em>Guilt-phase instructions. </em>Noting that he was acquitted of rape, in proposition of law V, Gapen argues that the trial court\u2019s failure to instruct the jury on the elements of attempted rape requires that his convictions of the R.C. 2929.04(A)(7) death specifications for aggravated murder while committing or attempting to commit rape should be vacated. However, Gapen did not request an instruction on attempted rape or object to the trial court\u2019s failure to give instructions on attempted rape. Thus, Gapen has waived all but plain error. Crim.R. 30(A); <em>State v. Long </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 91, 7 O.O.3d 178, 372 N.E.2d 804, paragraphs one and two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-8\">{\u00b6 75} Instructions to a jury \u201cmay not be judged in artificial isolation but must be viewed in the context of the overall charge.\u201d <em>State v. Pnce </em>(1979), 60 Ohio St.2d 136, 14 O.O.3d 379, 398 N.E.2d 772, paragraph four of the syllabus. Taken as a whole, we find that the trial court\u2019s instructions effectively advised the jury on attempted rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b449-9\">{\u00b6 76} First, as to each of the R.C. 2929.04(A)(7) rape specifications, the jury was instructed that it must find that \u201cthe aggravated murder was committed while the Defendant was committing or <em>attempting to commit </em>or in fleeing immediately after committing or <em>attempting to commit </em>the offense of rape.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Although Gapen has not challenged the instructions on felony-murder rape in Counts VII, XI, and XV, the jury was instructed on each of these counts that \u201c[bjefore you can find the Defendant guilty, you must find * * * the Defendant purposely caused the death of another * * * while committing or <em>attempting to commit </em>or while fleeing immediately after committing or <em>attempting to commit </em>the offense of rape.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b449-10\">{\u00b6 77} Second, the trial court defined \u201cattempt\u201d for the jury. During instructions on attempted aggravated robbery that preceded instructions on the rape specifications, the trial court informed the jury that \u201c[a]n attempt occurs when a person purposely engages in conduct that, if successful, will result in a theft offense.\u201d The trial court referred to this definition of attempt when later instructing the jury on rape in Counts VII, XI, and XV. Under these circumstances, the trial court\u2019s failure to refer to its earlier definition of attempt when <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"372\">*372</page-number>instructing the jury on the R.C. 2929.04(A)(7) rape specifications was not of crucial importance.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-4\">{\u00b6 78} Finally, at the conclusion of the guilt-phase instructions, the jury was advised, \u201cThe Court cannot embody all the laws in any single part of the instructions. In considering one portion, you must consider it in light and in harmony of all the instructions.\u201d Based on this instruction and the trial court\u2019s reference to the definition of attempt during its instructions on Counts VII, XI, and XV, we find that the jury was adequately instructed on attempt as it applied to the R.C. 2929.04(A)(7) rape specifications. Moreover, the trial court provided the jury with a written copy of the instructions, and the jury was able to refer to the definition of \u201cattempt\u201d during its deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-5\">{\u00b6 79} Thus, there was no plain error, and we overrule proposition V.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-6\">{\u00b6 80} <em>Gruesome photographs. </em>In proposition of law VIII, Gapen argues that the trial court erred in admitting gruesome autopsy and crime-scene photographs of the victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-7\">{\u00b6 81} In capital cases, nonrepetitive photographs, even if gruesome, are admissible as long as the probative value of each photograph outweighs the danger of material prejudice to the accused. <em>State v. Maurer </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 239, 15 OBR 379, 473 N.E.2d 768, paragraph seven of the syllabus; <em>State v. Morales </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 252, 257, 513 N.E.2d 267. Decisions on the admissibility of photographs are \u201cleft to the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>State v. Slagle </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 597, 601, 605 N.E.2d 916.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-8\">{\u00b6 82} <em>Crime-scene photographs. </em>Gapen complains about four gruesome crime-scene photographs. The state sought to introduce 24 photos from the basement crime scene. The judge admitted 13 of these photos. However, five of these photographs were of the general basement area and did not involve photos of the victims or blood, and one of the other photographs was not used at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-9\">{\u00b6 83} State\u2019s exhibit 88 depicts Madewell\u2019s and Marshall\u2019s bodies as they were found in the basement. During trial, the trial counsel stated that the defense had no objection to state\u2019s exhibit 88, and hence Gapen can complain only of plain error as to that exhibit. <em>State v. Twyford </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 340, 358, 763 N.E.2d 122. However, there was no plain error. This photograph illustrated the testimony of the detectives at the scene and portrayed the victims\u2019 bodies in relation to their surroundings.</p>\n<p id=\"b450-10\">{\u00b6 84} The trial counsel objected to the other three crime-scene photos. State\u2019s exhibit 90 depicts Madewell\u2019s body after the table over her body was removed. Madewell\u2019s body is covered by blankets, and none of her upper body or head wounds is visible. State\u2019s exhibit 102 is a close-up of Marshall\u2019s body as it was found on the couch. The body is covered with a blanket, but his head <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"373\">*373</page-number>wounds are visible in the photograph. State\u2019s exhibit 105 is a close-up of the wounds on Marshall\u2019s right forearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-4\">{\u00b6 85} The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting these few selected photographs. State\u2019s exhibit 90 presented a view of Madewell\u2019s body that is not particularly gruesome and was relevant in showing the position of her body at the crime scene. State\u2019s exhibits 102 and 105 depicted the wounds inflicted on Marshall and helped to prove Gapen\u2019s intent and lack of accident or mistake.

Moreover, these photos gave the jury an \u201cappreciation of the nature and circumstances of the crimes.\u201d <em>State v.

However, the trial court permitted the admission of only six autopsy slides per victim. Subsequently, duplicate photographs were made of the slides, and the photographs were introduced into evidence in place of the slides.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-6\">{\u00b6 87} State\u2019s exhibit 1A depicts Jesica\u2019s body prior to the autopsy. This photograph shows wounds to Jesica\u2019s jaw and showed the location of chop wounds on her right lower leg. State\u2019s exhibit 14A shows a skull fracture underneath a large chop wound on Jesica\u2019s scalp, and state\u2019s exhibit 22A shows a chop wound above her left ear. State\u2019s exhibit 26A depicts chop wounds and extensive swelling of Jesica\u2019s face and tongue, and state\u2019s exhibit 29A is an inside view of Jesica\u2019s mouth, showing a broken jaw, missing teeth, and fragments of braces. Finally, state\u2019s exhibit 35A shows chop wounds on Jesica\u2019s upper chest and neck area.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-7\">{\u00b6 88} State\u2019s exhibit 41A is a decidedly gruesome photograph showing Made-well\u2019s body at the coroner\u2019s office. This photograph depicts extensive wounds to her face and neck. Moreover, this photograph shows that her shirt and bra had been pushed above her breasts and helped to prove attempted rape. State\u2019s exhibits 43A and 47A show chop wounds on the face and neck areas. State\u2019s exhibits 48A and 50A show multiple chop wounds to the back of Madewell\u2019s head. Finally, state\u2019s exhibit 57A depicts swelling on the underside of the brain, indicating that Madewell was alive for a period of time after the beating began. This photo also shows a chop wound of the brain stem that was a fatal injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b451-8\">{\u00b6 89} State\u2019s exhibit 62A is another gruesome photograph showing Marshall\u2019s body at the coroner\u2019s office. The photograph shows that Marshall suffered massive head and chest injuries. State\u2019s exhibits 65A, 72A, and 74A show multiple chop wounds to Marshall\u2019s face and neck. State\u2019s exhibit 79A shows that he also received chop wounds to his chest. Finally, state\u2019s exhibit 81 depicts lacerations of the liver caused by the chop wounds on Marshall\u2019s chest.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"374\">*374</page-number>{\u00b6 90} The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting any of the autopsy photographs of the three victims. The 18 autopsy photos were limited in number, noncumulative, and had substantial probative value and relevance. Each of these photos illustrated the coroner\u2019s testimony and demonstrated Gapen\u2019s specific intent to kill. See <em>Hartman, </em>93 Ohio St.3d at 289, 754 N.E.2d 1150; <em>State v. Goodwin </em>(1999), 84 Ohio St.3d 331, 342, 703 N.E.2d 1251.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-5\">{\u00b6 91} During the penalty phase, the trial counsel did not object to the reintroduction of the photographs into evidence, and the trial court did not commit plain error by allowing these photographs into evidence. See <em>Twyford, </em>94 Ohio St.3d at 358, 763 N.E.2d 122; <em>State v. DePew </em>(1988), 38 Ohio St.3d 275, 282-283, 528 N.E.2d 542. Based on the foregoing, we overrule proposition VIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-6\">{\u00b6 92} <em>Prosecutorial misconduct. </em>In proposition of law XII, Gapen argues that the prosecutor committed misconduct during the guilt-phase closing argument. The test for prosecutorial misconduct is whether the remarks were improper and, if so, whether they prejudicially affected the accused\u2019s substantial rights. <em>State v. Smith </em>(1984), 14 Ohio St.3d 13, 14-15, 14 OBR 317, 470 N.E.2d 883. The touchstone of analysis \u201cis the fairness of the trial, not the culpability of the prosecutor.\u201d <em>Smith v. Phillips </em>(1982), 455 U.S. 209, 219, 102 S.Ct. 940, 71 L.Ed.2d 78.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-7\">{\u00b6 93} <em>Vouching. </em>Gapen complains that during rebuttal argument, the prosecutor vouched for the truthfulness of the testimony of Detective Mark Salyer by stating: \u201cYou think that Detective Mark Salyer is going to get on the stand and tell you things that aren\u2019t true? He\u2019s going to get up here and perjure himself? You know the police are not on trial here. Detective Mark Salyer is not on trial. * * * You know who is on trial here? The Defendant, he\u2019s on trial here. These officers came in and did the best job they could. They told you what they did.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b452-8\">{\u00b6 94} However, the trial counsel did not object to this argument and waived any objection except plain error. <em>Long, </em>53 Ohio St.2d 91, 7 O.O.3d 178, 372 N.E.2d 804, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b452-9\">{\u00b6 95} \u201cIt is improper for an attorney to express his or her personal belief or opinion as to the credibility of a witness or as to the guilt of the accused.\u201d <em>State v. Williams </em>(1997), 79 Ohio St.3d 1, 12, 679 N.E.2d 646. However, the evidence does not establish that the prosecutor vouched for Detective Salyer. Rather, the prosecutor was simply rebutting the trial counsel\u2019s closing argument that attacked the truthfulness of Detective Salyer\u2019s testimony. See <em>Goodwin, </em>84 Ohio St.3d at 339-340, 703 N.E.2d 1251 (prosecutor entitled to respond to defense comments about a pretrial agreement by mentioning that the witness agreed to tell the truth as part of the plea agreement). Moreover, in making this argument, the prosecutor properly asked the jury to decide for themselves the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"375\">*375</page-number>likelihood that Detective Salyer perjured himself. Thus, we find no prosecutorial vouching.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-4\">{\u00b6 96} <em>Commenting on Gapen\u2019s failure to testify. </em>Gapen also alleges that the prosecutor, during argument, committed misconduct by commenting on Gapen\u2019s failure to testify. Here, the prosecutor, Mr. Daidone, argued:</p>\n<p id=\"b453-5\">{\u00b6 97} \u201cMr. Daidone: * * * There were three people in that room at that time, three people. The Defendant killed two of them. That leaves him. That leaves him. You know what, he\u2019s a witness. He\u2019s the best witness for what he did.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-6\">{\u00b6 98} \u201cMr. Greer: I\u2019m going to have to object to this.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-7\">{\u00b6 99} \u201cThe Court: Sustained. Don\u2019t go there.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-8\">{\u00b6 100} \u201cMr. Daidone: What does he say? What does he say?</p>\n<p id=\"b453-9\">{\u00b6 101} \u201cMr. Greer: Objection</p>\n<p id=\"b453-10\">{\u00b6 102} \u201cThe Court: Sustained.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b453-11\">{\u00b6 103} It is improper for a prosecutor to comment on a defendant\u2019s failure to testify. <em>Griffin v. California </em>(1965), 380 U.S. 609, 615, 85 S.Ct. 1229, 14 L.Ed.2d 106. In determining whether there was a violation of the defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment rights, the court must consider \u201c \u2018whether the language used was manifestly intended or was of such character that the jury would naturally and necessarily take it to be a comment on the failure of the accused to testify.\u2019 \u201d (Emphasis deleted.) <em>State v. Webb </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 325, 328, 638 N.E.2d 1023, quoting <em>Knowles v. United States </em>(C.A.10, 1955), 224 F.2d 168.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-12\">{\u00b6 104} The prosecutor was discussing the rape offense when he commented that Gapen was the \u201cbest witness for what he did.\u201d However, the prosecutor\u2019s comments referred to Gapen\u2019s confession to the police and not his failure to testify. Indeed, after the trial court sustained the defense objection, the prosecutor mentioned Gapen\u2019s police statement:</p>\n<p id=\"b453-13\">{\u00b6 105} \u201cMr. Daidone: In the statement to Detective Salyer, what does he say about the sexual thing that occurred? He says, T had sex with Martha.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b453-14\">{\u00b6 106} When the prosecutor\u2019s comments are placed in the context of his overall argument, it is clear that his comments were not \u201cmanifestly intended * * * to be a comment on the failure of [Gapen] to testify.\u201d <em>Webb, </em>70 Ohio St.3d at 328, 638 N.E.2d 1023. Moreover, isolated comments by a prosecutor are not to be taken out of context and given their most damaging meaning. <em>Donnelly v. DeChristoforo </em>(1974), 416 U.S. 637, 647, 94 S.Ct. 1868, 40 L.Ed.2d 431. Thus, we find that the prosecutor\u2019s remarks were proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b453-15\">{\u00b6 107} Based on the foregoing, we overrule proposition XII.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-4\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number>\n<em>Penalty-Phase Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b454-5\">{\u00b6 108} <em>Instructions on readmitted evidence. </em>In proposition of law X, Gapen contends that the trial court erred by instructing the jury: \u201cFor purposes of this proceeding, only that evidence admitted in the trial phase that is relevant to the aggravating circumstances and to any of the mitigating factors is to be considered by you.\u201d However, Gapen did not object to this instruction and thus waived any objection but plain error. See <em>State v. Childs </em>(1968), 14 Ohio St.2d 56, 43 O.O.2d 119, 236 N.E.2d 545, paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-6\">{\u00b6 109} To the extent that the jury might have interpreted the trial court\u2019s instructions as allowing them to determine relevancy, the trial court erred. It is \u201cthe trial court\u2019s responsibility to determine the admissibility of evidence.\u201d <em>State v. Getsy </em>(1998), 84 Ohio St.3d 180, 201, 702 N.E.2d 866. However, much of the guilt-phase evidence was relevant to the aggravating circumstances, the nature and circumstances of the offense, and the mitigating factors. Additionally, overwhelming evidence properly admitted during the penalty phase supports the jury\u2019s findings that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating factors as to the aggravated murder of Young. See <em>State v. Bryan, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 272, 2004-Ohio-971, 804 N.E.2d 433, \u00b6 208. Thus, the trial court\u2019s misstatement did not result in plain error. Thus, proposition X is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-7\">{\u00b6 110} <em>Ineffective assistance of counsel. </em>In proposition of law IX, Gapen raises two instances of ineffective assistance of counsel at the penalty phase of his trial. Reversal of a conviction for ineffective assistance of counsel requires that the defendant first show that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and, second, \u201cthat the deficient performance prejudiced the defense.\u201d <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. Accord <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-8\">{\u00b6 111} <em>Failure to object to readmission of the evidence. </em>First, Gapen claims that defense counsel were ineffective by agreeing to readmit all trial evidence during the penalty phase. In particular, Gapen attacks the readmission of the autopsy photographs as both irrelevant and prejudicial. However, the defense counsel were not deficient in failing to object, because such evidence was admissible. See <em>DePew, </em>38 Ohio St.3d 275, 528 N.E.2d 542, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b454-9\">{\u00b6 112} <em>Failure to object to instructions on readmitted evidence. </em>Second, Gapen challenges his counsel\u2019s failure to object when the trial court instructed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>the jury that it had to determine what guilt-phase evidence was relevant during the penalty phase. As previously discussed, the trial court erred by giving that instruction. Regardless, Gapen was not prejudiced by defense counsel\u2019s failure to object to the instruction. Overwhelming evidence was properly admitted during the penalty phase that supported the jury\u2019s finding that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating factors as to Jesica\u2019s aggravated murder. See <em>State v. Jones </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 335, 355, 744 N.E.2d 1163. Based on the foregoing, proposition IX is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-5\">{\u00b6 113} <em>Jury deadlock. </em>In proposition of law I, Gapen argues that the trial court erred by instructing the jury to continue deliberations after the jury informed the trial court that it was deadlocked on which life sentence to impose.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-6\">{\u00b6 114} The jury began penalty deliberations at 11:45 a.m. on June 21, 2001, and retired for the day at 5:05 p.m. The jury resumed deliberations on June 22 at 8:35 a.m. At 9:58 a.m., the jury requested a clarification on the instructions that addressed voting on life sentences. After conferring with counsel, the trial court informed the jury, \u201cThe Court suggests that you reread all the instructions very carefully and slowly as they contain all of the law that the Court can give you in this matter.\u201d The jury then resumed deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-7\">{\u00b6 115} At 12:20 p.m. on June 22, the foreperson informed the court, \u201cWe, the jury, cannot unanimously agree on a specific life sentence and are unable to render a sentencing verdict.\u201d After a further meeting with counsel, the trial court and counsel met with the jury. The trial court read the note back to the jury and the following colloquy took place:</p>\n<p id=\"b455-8\">{\u00b6 116} \u201cThe Court: * * * Now this poses two questions to the Court. First of all, for the foreperson to answer is this as to all counts?</p>\n<p id=\"b455-9\">{\u00b6 117} \u201cMs. Flournoy: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b455-10\">{\u00b6 118} \u201cThe Court: Okay. Have you reached the point where you are no longer being productive as jurors in your discussion?</p>\n<p id=\"b455-11\">{\u00b6 119} \u201cMs. Flournoy: Correct.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b455-12\">{\u00b6 120} Before sending the jury back to deliberations, the court issued a supplemental instruction taken from 4 Ohio Jury Instructions (2004) 148, Section 503.011(33), and referred to as a <em>Howard </em>charge. See <em>State v. Howard </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 18, 537 N.E.2d 188, paragraph two of the syllabus. The trial court advised the jurors:</p>\n<p id=\"b455-13\">{\u00b6 121} \u201cIn a large portion of the cases, absolute certainty cannot be obtained or expected. Although the verdict must reflect the verdict of each individual juror and not mere acquiescence in the conclusion of other jurors, each question submitted to you should be examined with proper regard and deference to the opinion of others. It is desirable that this case be decided. It is your duty to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"378\">*378</page-number>decide the case if you can conscientiously do so. You should listen to one another\u2019s arguments with a disposition to be persuaded. Do not hesitate to reexamine your views and change your position if you are convinced that it is erroneous. If there is disagreement, all jurors should re-examine their positions given that a unanimous verdict has not been reached. Jurors for any of the verdicts should consider whether their doubt is reasonable considering that it is not shared by others * * * who have the same evidence and with the same desire to arrive at a verdict and under the same oath. Likewise, jurors for any of the verdicts should ask themselves whether or not they reasonably doubt the correctness of the judgment not concurred in by all other jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-5\">{\u00b6 122} \u2018You shall return a verdict of death if you unanimously, and that means all twelve, find beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating factors. If you do not so find, [then] you shall continue deliberations on the life sentence options and, if possible, unanimously return a verdict of life imprisonment * * *. However, you should not surrender honest convictions in order to be congenial or to reach a verdict solely because of the opinion of other jurors.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-6\">{\u00b6 123} \u201cIf it is impossible for you to reach a decision in this case, please report the fact to the Court in writing.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b456-7\">{\u00b6 124} The defense objected to the instruction concerning the death penalty, arguing that the jurors were \u201cpast that point.\u201d The trial court overruled that objection.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-8\">{\u00b6 125} The jury resumed deliberations and retired for the day at 7:00 p.m. The jury began deliberation on June 23 at 8:35 a.m. and reached a verdict on sentence at 11:40 a.m. After the verdict was announced, the jurors were polled and confirmed that the death sentence was unanimous.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-9\">{\u00b6 126} Gapen claims that the jury\u2019s note clearly indicated that the deadlock was over possible life sentences and that the jury had already rejected the death penalty as an option. Citing <em>State v. Springer </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 167, 586 N.E.2d 96, Gapen argues that the trial court should have instructed the jury to deliberate only toward reaching a unanimous verdict on one of the three life sentences and erred by instructing the jury that it could still consider death as a sentencing option. Further, Gapen argues that the <em>Howard </em>charge undermined instructions that a solitary juror could prevent the imposition of the death penalty, in violation of <em>State v. Brooks </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 148, 159-160, 661 N.E.2d 1030.</p>\n<p id=\"b456-10\">{\u00b6 127} Whether a jury is irreconcilably deadlocked is a \u201c \u2018necessarily discretionary determination\u2019 \u201d for the trial court to make. <em>State v. Brown, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 51, 2003-Ohio-5059, 796 N.E.2d 506, \u00b6 37, quoting <em>Arizona v. Washington </em>(1978), 434 U.S. 497, 98 S.Ct. 824, 54 L.Ed.2d 717, fn. 28. There is no bright-line <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"379\">*379</page-number>test to determine when a trial court should instruct the jury to limit itself to the life sentence options or take the case away from the jury. In making such a determination, the court must evaluate each case based on its own particular circumstances. See <em>State v. Mason </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 144, 167, 694 N.E.2d 932.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-4\">{\u00b6 128} The trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that the jury was not irreconcilably deadlocked. Hence, the trial court properly instructed the jury using a <em>Howard </em>charge to continue deliberations on all sentencing options. In several cases, we have upheld the use of a <em>Howard </em>charge, specifically finding that such an instruction is not coercive, and is \u201c \u2018intended for a jury that believes it is deadlocked, so as to challenge them to try one last time to reach a consensus.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Brown, </em>100 Ohio St.3d 51, 2003-Ohio-5059, 796 N.E.2d 506, at \u00b6 38, quoting <em>State v. Robb </em>(2000), 88 Ohio St.3d 59, 81, 723 N.E.2d 1019; see, also, <em>State v. Mason </em>(1998), 82 Ohio St.3d 144, 167, 694 N.E.2d 932.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-5\">{\u00b6 129} Contrary to Gapen\u2019s assertions, the jury\u2019s note did not clearly indicate that the jury had rejected the death penalty as a sentencing option. In overruling the defense motion .on limiting the sentence options, the trial court stated, \u201cI could speculate that, but * * * the note is not horribly clear as to where they are in disagreement, [and] I must give them the charge reflecting all counts which are before them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b457-6\">{\u00b6 130} Moreover, there is no evidence that the jury was coerced into returning a death sentence. After receiving the <em>Howard </em>charge, the jury was left with all the sentencing options and was free to return a life sentence on all counts. Indeed, the fact that the jury returned life sentences on all counts except one, the murder of Young, shows that the jury fully understood its options to return life sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-7\">{\u00b6 131} Furthermore, the <em>Howard </em>charge did not undermine the role of a solitary juror in violation of <em>Brooks, </em>75 Ohio St.3d at 160, 661 N.E.2d 1030. The supplemental instructions explicitly advised the jurors that if they were unable to unanimously agree to recommend death, they must consider life sentences. The jury was thus implicitly advised that a single juror could prevent the death penalty. See <em>Hartman, </em>93 Ohio St.3d at 291, 754 N.E.2d 1150. Moreover, the trial court\u2019s penalty-phase instructions included the solitary-juror instruction, and the <em>Howard </em>charge did not rescind that instruction.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-8\">{\u00b6 132} Finally, this case can be distinguished from <em>Springer. </em>In <em>Springer, </em>after the jury informed the judge that it was stalemated, the judge gave the jury a supplemental charge similar to the <em>Howard </em>charge. The jury queried the judge several more times, again indicating that it was struggling against a stalemate. The jury then informed the court on the third day of deliberations that it was hopelessly deadlocked and could not unanimously recommend any <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>sentence, and it was discharged. <em>Springer, </em>63 Ohio St.3d at 168-169, 586 N.E.2d 96. In contrast, after hearing the <em>Howard </em>charge, the jury in this case resumed deliberations on the afternoon of June 22 and made no further inquiries of the court before returning a verdict on the morning of June 23-. Thus, unlike in <em>Springer, </em>the jury was not hopelessly deadlocked and unable to unanimously return any sentence. Thus, we overrule proposition I.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">{\u00b6 133} <em>Merger. </em>In proposition of law II, Gapen claims that the trial court erred by failing to merge the multiple murder counts for each victim prior to the penalty-phase deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-6\">{\u00b6 134} The trial court overruled the defense request to merge the murder counts relating to each victim prior to the penalty-phase deliberations. However, before imposing sentence, the trial court separately merged the counts of murders regarding Madewell and Marshall into one count for each and imposed a single life sentence for each of those two murders. The trial court also merged the counts of murder regarding Jesica that brought life sentences with the single count bringing the death sentence before imposing the death sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">{\u00b6 135} The general rule is that a defendant may be charged with multiple counts based on the same conduct but may be convicted of only one, and the trial court effects the merger at sentencing. R.C. 2941.25(A); <em>State v. Palmer </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 543, 572, 687 N.E.2d 685; <em>State v. Waddy </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 424, 447, 588 N.E.2d 819. A \u201cconviction\u201d includes both the guilt determination and the penalty imposition. See <em>State v. Poindexter </em>(1988), 36 Ohio St.3d 1, 5, 520 N.E.2d 568. Gapen\u2019s right to not be convicted of more than one offense based upon the same conduct was not violated, because, in imposing sentence, the trial court merged the separate counts for each victim.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-8\">{\u00b6 136} Moreover, the trial court did not err by merging the three counts in which life sentences were recommended with the single count recommending a death sentence. Pursuant to R.C. 2929.03(D)(3), the trial court considered the jury\u2019s recommendation of the death sentence in Count 13 and then independently weighed the evidence and found beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating factors and imposed the sentence of death. We find that the trial court properly merged all the counts for Jesica\u2019s murder and properly imposed the death sentence for Count 13 as the jury had recommended. Thus, we reject proposition II.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-9\">{\u00b6 137} <em>Inconsistent sentences. </em>In proposition of law III, Gapen contends that his death sentence for Jesica\u2019s murder should be vacated because the jury\u2019s sentencing verdicts \u2014 life on Counts 14 through 16 and death on Count <em>13 </em>\u2014 were inconsistent. Gapen argues that because the aggravating circumstances and mitigating factors were identical on each count, the inconsistent sentencing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"381\">*381</page-number>verdicts were arbitrary and constitutionally invalid. However, we reject this argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-5\">{\u00b6 138} First, \u201c[i]nconsistent verdicts on different counts of a multi-count indictment do not justify overturning a verdict * * <em>State v. Hicks </em>(1989), 43 Ohio St.3d 72, 78, 538 N.E.2d 1030, citing <em>United States v. Powell </em>(1984), 469 U.S. 57, 68, 105 S.Ct. 471, 83 L.Ed.2d 461; see, also, <em>State v. Mapes </em>(1985), 19 Ohio St.3d 108, 112-113, 19 OBR 318, 484 N.E.2d 140. As we stated in <em>State v. Adams </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 223, 7 O.O.3d 393, 374 N.E.2d 137, paragraph two of the syllabus, \u201cThe several counts of an indictment containing more than one count are not interdependent and an inconsistency in a verdict does not arise out of inconsistent responses to different counts, but only arises out of inconsistent responses to the same count.\u201d Thus, inconsistency of sentencing verdicts on the different counts does not require that Gapen\u2019s death sentence be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-6\">{\u00b6 139} Second, the jury\u2019s verdicts are not inconsistent. The jury was required to \u201cconsider, and weigh against the aggravating circumstances proved beyond a reasonable doubt, the nature and circumstances of the offense.\u201d R.C. 2929.04(B); See <em>State v. Wogenstahl </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 344, 355, 662 N.E.2d 311. Prior calculation and design were elements of the offense charged in Count 13 and an integral part of the nature and circumstances of that offense. Prior calculation and design were not elements of the felony-murders in Counts 14 through 16. In weighing the nature and circumstances of the offense, the jury may have determined that the felony-murder counts were mitigated by Gapen\u2019s despair over the failure of his marriage and in seeing Madewell with another man. On the other hand, the jury may have found that Gapen\u2019s decision to murder Jesica was not mitigated at all. See <em>State v. Stumpf </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 95, 512 N.E.2d 598, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-7\">{\u00b6 140} Based on the foregoing, proposition III is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-8\">{\u00b6 141} <em>Sentencing opinion. </em>In proposition of law XI, Gapen contends that the trial court\u2019s sentencing opinion improperly failed to mention his probable good adjustment to prison life as a mitigating factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-9\">{\u00b6 142} As a defense witness during the penalty phase, Dr. Robert Smith, a clinical psychologist, testified that Gapen should adapt well to prison life and act appropriately. In its R.C. 2929.03(F) sentencing opinion, the trial court did not mention Gapen\u2019s ability to adapt to prison life as a mitigating factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-10\">{\u00b6 143} We have previously recognized that the ability to adjust to prison life is a mitigating factor that can be assigned weight. <em>State v. Madrigal </em>(2000), 87 Ohio St.3d 378, 397, 721 N.E.2d 52; <em>State v. Smith </em>(1997), 80 Ohio St.3d 89, 121-122, 684 N.E.2d 668. However, Gapen erroneously assumes that evidence that is not specifically mentioned in the sentencing opinion was not considered. \u2018While a sentencing court must consider all evidence of mitigation, it need not discuss each factor individually.\u201d <em>State v. Phillips </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 72, 102, 656 N.E.2d 643, citing <em>Parker v. Dugger </em>(1991), 498 U.S. 308, 314-315, 111 S.Ct. 731, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"382\">*382</page-number>112 L.Ed.2d 812. Moreover, whether to give any weight to a mitigating factor is for the trial court\u2019s determination. <em>State v. Lott </em>(1990), 51 Ohio St.3d 160, 171, 555 N.E.2d 293. Finally, we will consider this factor in our independent reassessment of the sentence, which will correct any error or omission. <em>State v. Fox </em>(1994), 69 Ohio St.3d 183, 191, 631 N.E.2d 124; <em>Maurer, </em>15 Ohio St.3d at 247, 15 OBR 379, 473 N.E.2d 768. Thus, proposition XI is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">{\u00b6 144} <em>Weighing and determination of the death penalty. </em>In proposition of law VI, Gapen argues that the death penalty must be vacated because the aggravating circumstances do not outweigh the mitigating factors. Gapen claims that the murders represented a total aberration in an otherwise exemplary life and that he will adjust well to prison life. We will consider this argument during our independent sentence evaluation.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">\n<em>Settled Issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b460-6\">{\u00b6 145} <em>Reasonable doubt. </em>In proposition of law XIII, Gapen challenges the constitutionality of the trial court\u2019s instructions on reasonable doubt in R.C. 2901.05(D) during both phases of the trial. However, we have repeatedly affirmed the constitutionality of R.C. 2901.05. See <em>State v. Jones, </em>91 Ohio St.3d at 347, 744 N.E.2d 1163. Proposition XIII is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">{\u00b6 146} <em>Constitutionality. </em>In proposition of law XIV, Gapen attacks the constitutionality of Ohio\u2019s death-penalty statutes. We also reject this claim. See <em>State v. Carter </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 593, 607, 734 N.E.2d 345; <em>State v. Jenkins </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 164, 15 OBR 311, 473 N.E.2d 264, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">{\u00b6 147} Gapen also argues that Ohio\u2019s death-penalty statutes violate international agreements to which the United States is a party. However, we have rejected similar arguments. <em>State v. Bey </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 487, 502, 709 N.E.2d 484; <em>Phillips, </em>74 Ohio St.3d at 103-104, 656 N.E.2d 643.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-9\">INDEPENDENT SENTENCE EVALUATION</p>\n<p id=\"b460-10\">{\u00b6 148} <em>Aggravating circumstances. </em>The evidence established that Gapen murdered Jesica as part of a course of conduct involving the purposeful killing of two or more persons, R.C. 2929.04(A)(5), and while committing or attempting to commit burglary, rape, and robbery, R.C. 2929.04(A)(7). However, because we have dismissed the R.C. 2929.04(A)(4) specifications, we will not consider them in weighing the aggravating circumstances against the mitigating factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-11\">{\u00b6 149} <em>Mitigation evidence. </em>Gapen called 12 mitigation witnesses and made an unsworn statement.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-12\">{\u00b6 150} Dr. Robert Smith interviewed and tested Gapen. Results from the Minnesota Multi-Phasic Personality Inventory (\u201cMMPI\u201d) showed no indication of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"383\">*383</page-number>either a severe psychotic disorder or a significant antisocial personality disorder. The MMPI indicated that Gapen tends to be \u201csomewhat restrictive in his emotions, meaning he doesn\u2019t display a lot of emotions.\u201d The MMPI also showed that Gapen has personality traits that are \u201cperfectionistic and obsessive.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b461-4\">{\u00b6 151} Results from the Michigan Alcoholism Screening Test (\u201cMAST\u201d) showed that Gapen\u2019s \u201cuse of alcohol is a problem and should be explored further.\u201d The Substance Abuse Subtle Screening Inventory (\u201cSASSI\u201d) showed that Gapen \u201cdoesn\u2019t believe he\u2019s got a problem with alcohol, but all the indicators [say] that he is [an] alcoholic.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">{\u00b6 152} The Falstein Mini Mental Status exam (\u201cFMMS\u201d) showed that Gapen has \u201cno cognitive impairment * * * so there was nothing at all impaired in his thinking.\u201d Additionally, screening results from Part I of the Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder exam (\u201cPTSD\u201d) demonstrated that \u201cthere\u2019s been no significant trauma in Mr. Gapen\u2019s life that affects him today.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">{\u00b6 153} Dr. Smith\u2019s assessment of Gapen during their interviews was consistent with Gapen\u2019s test results. Dr. Smith found that Gapen was not mentally retarded, did not have a psychotic disorder, and showed no evidence of an antisocial or sociopathic personality. However, Dr. Smith testified that prior to the murders, Gapen had been \u201cstruggling with acute depression * * * and a number of bad things had happened in his life that were very stressful * * * and he wasn\u2019t coping very well. He was very, very sad.\u201d According to Dr. Smith, \u201c[o]ne of the ways [Gapen] was coping * * * was increasing his use of alcohol * * * and during this period of time his use of alcohol continued and seemed to get even worse * *</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">{\u00b6 154} Dr. Smith also discussed behavioral problems associated with Gapen\u2019s personality characteristics. Dr. Smith stated, \u201cThe difficulty that I see for Mr. Gapen is * * * not anything outside the realm of the average person.\u201d However, Gapen has a \u201cperfectionistic approach to life\u201d and \u201cobsesses.\u201d Such people tend to \u201cagitate themselves and kind of get themselves worked up, and if they\u2019re in a very stressful time with a lot of things going wrong, that just builds on them.\u201d Additionally, \u201c[i]f you add alcohol to that, it only gets worse,\u201d creating \u201cthe likelihood of someone acting impulsively, irrationally, and violently.\u201d As a final matter, Dr. Smith opined that Gapen would adapt well to the structured environment of prison life.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-8\">{\u00b6 155} William Ames, a friend of Gapen, coached football with Gapen and was a board member with Gapen for the Huber Heights Youth Football Club (\u201cHHYFC\u201d). For eight to ten years, Gapen worked in numerous capacities with the youth football program. Ames described Gapen as \u201cvery compassionate toward kids,\u201d saying, \u201cIf one of the kids didn\u2019t have a pair of cleats or something, he\u2019d find a way to get a pair of cleats to the kid, and I don\u2019t ever remember him <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"384\">*384</page-number>yelling at them in anger.\u201d Ames also said, \u201c[W]hen I first met [Gapen], I thought he was probably one of the most non-violent people I have ever met. He was not one to argue * * * just cool, calm, and collected and enjoyed having fun.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Ao6\">{\u00b6 156} Jennifer Gray, another friend of Gapen, had also met him though HHYFC and knew him for 10 years. Gapen was described as \u201cvery, very nice,\u201d and \u201creally wonderful to the children.\u201d Gapen was also very friendly with adults and is \u201cone person everybody really likes.\u201d Gray was also a friend of Madewell. She testified that Gapen and Madewell \u201cgot along very well * * * until his drinking started.\u201d However, once the drinking started, Gapen and Madewell would start to argue. Madewell would also drink, and she \u201cjust got nasty.\u201d Nonetheless, \u201c[t]hey could be fighting one minute and loving the next.\u201d Finally, Gapen provided Christmas presents every year to children from needy families, and on one occasion, he organized a group that put a new roof on the home of a needy woman.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">{\u00b6 157} Steven Menard, a policeman and long-time friend of Gapen, coached baseball and football with him. Menard stated that \u201cMartha was a sweet lady\u201d and that Gapen and Madewell appeared to have a \u201cpretty good relationship\u201d at first. After Gapen abducted Madewell in June 2000, he contacted Menard, and Menard arranged for Gapen to turn himself in to the police. Thereafter, Menard told Gapen \u201cabout a million times to stay away from her and leave her alone.\u201d Menard tried to keep Gapen focused on taking care of Jimmy and Charity and keeping himself out of trouble.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-5\">{\u00b6 158} From June through September 2000, Menard saw Madewell and Gapen together at football games. According to Menard, they \u201cappeared to be a happy family, which * * * seemed a little odd to me since I knew that things weren\u2019t going well, that they were getting a dissolution.\u201d During cross-examination, Menard indicated that Gapen had a good relationship with his kids, but his relationship with Jesica was \u201ca little bit of a challenge.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-6\">{\u00b6 159} James Scott, another friend of Gapen, also knew Gapen as a coach and board member of the HHYFC. Gapen was described as a very good coach, about whom HHYFC \u201cnever had any complaints * * * in all the years that Larry coached the organization.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">{\u00b6 160} Jimmy Gapen, the defendant\u2019s son, testified that his mother had died when he was in the seventh grade. According to Jimmy, Gapen \u201cplayed a really good father role for [him] and [his] sister and taught [him] * * * tons of things.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"AeY\">{\u00b6 161} In August 1993, Madewell and her four children moved into the home of Gapen and his two children. In 1996, the families moved into a large two-story house in Huber Heights. During the summer of 1999, Daniel Marshall started \u201crunning with the wrong crowd\u201d and getting into trouble. On three occasions, Daniel and Gapen had an argument that erupted into a physical altercation <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"385\">*385</page-number>between Gapen, Madewell, and Daniel. Afterwards, Daniel was sent to live with his grandfather. According to Jimmy, Madewell was \u201creally upset,\u201d and there was very little affection between Madewell and Gapen after Daniel left home.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-4\">{\u00b6 162} In the fall of 1999, Gapen and Jimmy moved out of the family home. However, Gapen and Madewell continued to see each other. During the summer of 2000, Gapen appeared to be \u201creally upset,\u201d and his drinking became \u201cheavier and heavier.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">{\u00b6 163} Charity Gapen, the defendant\u2019s daughter, stated that Gapen was very happy during the early part of his relationship with Madewell. In June 2000, Charity stated that Gapen\u2019s relationship with Madewell started to change and became \u201chot and cold.\u201d Gapen did not have a good relationship with Daniel because Daniel \u201cdidn\u2019t like being told by anybody what to do.\u201d However, Gapen maintained a \u201creally good relationship\u201d with Billy. During cross-examination, Charity stated that Gapen and Jesica did not have a good relationship and \u201ccompletely avoided each other.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">{\u00b6 164} Diane Ogg, Gapen\u2019s older sister, grew up with Gapen, two other brothers, and a sister. The family lived in Pennsylvania, moved to Arizona, and then settled in Trotwood when Gapen was in the third grade. Gapen had a large paper route and loved to play baseball while growing up. He graduated from Trotwood Madison High School. Gapen was a \u201cvery likable person\u201d and seemed to \u201cget along well with every one\u201d in school. Shortly after graduating from high school, Gapen was married, and his daughter, Holly, was born in 1966. Subsequently, Gapen and his first wife divorced, but Gapen retained custody of Holly. Gapen remarried, and Jimmy and Charity were born during this marriage.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-7\">{\u00b6 165} Bradley Ogg, Gapen\u2019s brother-in-law, went to high school with Gapen. Gapen was described as a \u201cvery outgoing, gregarious type of individual.\u201d Gapen was an \u201corganizer,\u201d and he was \u201calways trying to make sure things went smoothly.\u201d In 1996 or 1997, Bradley saw Gapen and Madewell at a family reunion, and \u201c[e]verything seemed to be going very well,\u201d and \u201ceverybody seemed very happy.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">{\u00b6 166} Barry Gapen, the defendant\u2019s younger brother, stated that Gapen was a \u201cfather figure\u201d for Barry after their father died. Gapen taught him how to play baseball, and later in life, Gapen helped Barry get a job.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">{\u00b6 167} Jo Ann Fister, Gapen\u2019s younger sister, saw Gapen and Madewell during the holidays and attended a family celebration at Gapen and Madewell\u2019s home. According to Fister, Gapen, Madewell, and their children appeared to get along \u201cfine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b463-10\">{\u00b6 168} Elaine Gilmore, Gapen\u2019s mother, testified that her family moved to the Dayton area in 1957. Gapen\u2019s father was a carpenter, who later worked for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"386\">*386</page-number>Blossom Hill Dairy. Later, Elaine and her husband managed three stores for Lawson\u2019s Milk Company. In 1973, Gapen\u2019s father died.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">{\u00b6 169} According to Elaine, Gapen was \u201cvery active\u201d while growing up and never experienced any problems at school. While in high school, Gapen worked at an IGA grocery store and delivered newspapers. As an adult, Gapen worked for Gerber Baby Foods, Pepsi for 20 years, and then Federal Express. Gapen was described as a nonconfrontational person who did not get into trouble.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-5\">{\u00b6 170} Elaine testified that \u201c[everything seemed to be fine\u201d during the early part of Gapen and Madewell\u2019s relationship. However, problems with the children developed when Madewell\u2019s son, Daniel, started associating with individuals involved with \u201cdrinking and dope.\u201d After Gapen and Madewell separated, Gapen told his mother that he still loved Madewell. Gapen had a close relationship with Jimmy and Charity and developed a bond with Billy Madewell. Finally, Elaine testified that Gapen was hard-working, good-natured, and good-humored, and his personality had not changed over time.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">{\u00b6 171} <em>Gapen\u2019s unsworn statement. </em>Gapen stated that Madewell was on his mind when he got up on September 17. Gapen did not want his marriage to end. He said, \u201cIt\u2019s pretty hard to love somebody and find out that you\u2019re not going to be in her life; that they\u2019ve shut you out now.\u201d When he picked up the dissolution paperwork before September 17, he did not even want to look at it, leaving it on the seat of his car.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-7\">{\u00b6 172} Gapen addressed the families of the victims who were in court and said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry that everyone has to see me under these circumstances. * * * It\u2019s tough on these families. And I\u2019m very, very sorry, very sorry.\u201d Gapen said, \u201cI just gave all I could give. I don\u2019t understand why * * * this had to happen. There\u2019s no reason.\u201d He also stated that he loved Billy Madewell \u201cjust like [he] loved his mom.\u201d In discussing his problems with Daniel, Gapen said, \u201c[W]hen a young man comes home at night and he looks me straight in the eyes and he rips his tee shirt off and tells his stepdad that as long as he lives in my house, he rules * * * you just can\u2019t put up with that kind of stuff.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b464-8\">{\u00b6 173} In his concluding remarks, Gapen said, \u201cI loved this lady so much, and now it\u2019s gotten me in such a mess, but I still care and I love her. I wish now I would have walked away. But this hurt\u2019s behind me. * * * [M]aybe she would have come back to me, who knows? I really don\u2019t know.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b464-9\">\n<em>Sentence Evaluation</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b464-10\">{\u00b6 174} We find nothing in the nature and circumstances of these offenses to be mitigating. Gapen brutally murdered Jesica Young, an innocent 13-year-old girl, while she was asleep in her bedroom. Jesica\u2019s murder was part of a course of conduct during which Gapen murdered two other people in the house. Moreover, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"387\">*387</page-number>Jesica\u2019s murder occurred after Gapen committed burglary, robbery, and attempted rape.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-5\">{\u00b6 175} However, Gapen argues that these offenses were crimes of passion. Gapen contends that he was obsessed with Madewell, distraught that their marriage had ended, and went into a rage when he found Madewell with another man. However, Gapen\u2019s explanation provides no mitigating reason for murdering Jesica. Moreover, Jesica\u2019s murder was committed with prior calculation and design. Gapen murdered an innocent child while she lay sleeping in her bed. His only explanation for killing Jesica was that she would \u201cnever give him any respect\u201d and that she \u201cwas going to turn out just like them.\u201d Thus, we reject Gapen\u2019s claim that Jesica\u2019s murder is mitigated because it was a crime of passion.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-6\">{\u00b6 176} Gapen\u2019s history and background provide some mitigating features. Gapen has a long work history and served as football coach for a youth football club for many years.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-7\">{\u00b6 177} The statutory mitigating factors are generally inapplicable, including R.C. 2929.04(B)(1) (victim inducement), (B)(2) (duress, coercion, or strong provocation), (B)(3) (mental disease or defect), (B)(4) (youth of the offender), or (B)(6) (accomplice only).</p>\n<p id=\"b465-8\">{\u00b6 178} The R.C. 2929.04(B)(5) mitigating factor (lack of a significant criminal record) is entitled to weight in mitigation. The record discloses no history of criminal convictions. However, at the time of trial, Gapen was under indictment for abduction and had been found guilty of a misdemeanor charge for domestic violence that was still under appeal. Under these circumstances, we choose not to accord significant weight to this factor.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-9\">{\u00b6 179} We give modest weight to mitigating factors under R.C. 2929.04(B)(7) (other relevant factors). First, evidence that Gapen was an alcoholic, suffered from ongoing depression, and had other psychological problems (e.g., obsessive and perfectionistic personality traits) at the time of the murders is mitigating. <em>Bey, </em>85 Ohio St.3d at 509, 709 N.E.2d 484. However, we accord little weight to the defendant\u2019s alcoholism as a mitigating factor. See <em>Slagle, </em>65 Ohio St.3d at 614, 605 N.E.2d 916. Second, we give weight to evidence that Gapen will adapt well to prison life. <em>Madrigal, </em>87 Ohio St.3d at 397, 721 N.E.2d 52.</p>\n<p id=\"b465-10\">{\u00b6 180} Finally, Gapen\u2019s apologies to the victims\u2019 families are entitled to weight in mitigation. However, Gapen never specifically apologized for murdering Jesica. See <em>State v. Hughbanks, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 365, 2003-Ohio-4121, 792 N.E.2d 1081, at \u00b6 143; see, also, <em>State v. Keene </em>(1998), 81 Ohio St.3d 646, 671, 693 N.E.2d 246 (remorse entitled to little weight in mitigation). We find no evidence of any other mitigating factors under R.C. 2929.04(B)(7).</p>\n<p id=\"b466-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"388\">*388</page-number>{\u00b6 181} We find that the aggravating circumstances outweigh the mitigating factors beyond a reasonable doubt. Gapen\u2019s murder of Jesica during the course of a burglary, robbery, and attempted rape, and his course of conduct in multiple killings are grave aggravating circumstances. In contrast, Gapen offered no substantial mitigation to weigh against these collective aggravating circumstances. Thus, we find that the death penalty is appropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-4\">{\u00b6 182} Finally, we find that the death penalty is proportionate to death sentences approved in prior cases for other course-of-conduct murders. See <em>State v. Mink, </em>101 Ohio St.3d 350, 2004-Ohio-1580, 805 N.E.2d 1064, \u00b6 130; <em>Hughbanks, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 365, 2003-Ohio-4121, 792 N.E.2d 1081, \u00b6 145; and <em>State v. Braden, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 354, 2003-Ohio-1325, 785 N.E.2d 439, \u00b6 162. Furthermore, the death penalty is proportionate to death sentences approved for other burglary-murder and robbery-murder cases. See <em>State v. Williams, </em>99 Ohio St.3d 439, 2003-Ohio-4164, 793 N.E.2d 446, \u00b6 118; <em>State v. Thomas, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 309, 2002-Ohio-6624, 779 N.E.2d 1017, \u00b6 124; <em>State v. Stallings </em>(2000), 89 Ohio St.3d 280, 301, 731 N.E.2d 159. Finally, the death penalty is proportionate to death sentences approved for other attempted-rape/attempted-murder cases. See <em>State v. Bies </em>(1996), 74 Ohio St.3d 320, 328, 658 N.E.2d 754; <em>State v. Scudder </em>(1994), 71 Ohio St.3d 263, 276, 643 N.E.2d 524; <em>State v. Powell </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 255, 264, 552 N.E.2d 191.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-5\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b466-6\">{\u00b6 183} We dismiss Count One and the R.C. 2929.04(A)(4) specifications in Counts 5 though 16. However, we affirm the remaining convictions and sentence of death.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-7\">Judgment affirmed in part and reversed in part.</p>\n<judges id=\"b466-8\">Moyer, C.J., Resnick, F.E. Sweeney, Pfeifer, O\u2019Connor and O\u2019Donnell, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<p id=\"b466-9\">APPENDIX</p>\n<p id=\"b466-10\">{\u00b6 184} First Proposition of Law: Once a capital jury in the penalty phase has indicated that it has rejected the death sentence and is deadlocked as to which life sentence to impose, it is constitutionally impermissible for the trial court to instruct it to return to its deliberations and to consider death in an effort to reach a unanimous verdict.</p>\n<p id=\"b466-11\">{\u00b6 185} Second Proposition of Law: When the trial court fails to merge multiple aggravated murder counts for a single victim prior to the sentencing phase and a jury returns divergent sentencing recommendations for those counts, the resultant death sentence is invalid and violates the Eighth and Fourteenth <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"389\">*389</page-number>Amendments to the United States Constitution and Article I, Sections 2, 9 and 16 of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-5\">{\u00b6 186} Third Proposition of Law: Where the jury recommends the death sentence for one count of aggravated murder, but recommends a life sentence on three other counts for the same victim, and the aggravated circumstances and mitigating factors are identical, the resulting death sentence is arbitrary and must be vacated. U.S. Const. Amends. VIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-6\">{\u00b6 187} Fourth Proposition of Law: Where there is insufficient evidence of an escape, a trial court\u2019s denial of a Rule 29 motion for acquittal violates a capital defendant\u2019s rights guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 16 of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-7\">{\u00b6 188} Fifth Proposition of Law: Where the trial court fails to give any instruction as to an essential element in a capital specification, a jury\u2019s finding of guilty of that specification must be vacated. U.S. Const. Amends. VI, VIII and XIV.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-8\">{\u00b6 189} Sixth Proposition of Law: Where the defendant has led an otherwise exemplary life with the murder being a total aberration and he will adjust well to prison, the death penalty is not the appropriate punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-9\">{\u00b6 190} Seventh Proposition of Law: Police may not interrogate a defendant who has just invoked his <em>Miranda </em>rights to silence and to counsel. A defendant does not \u201cinitiate\u201d further questioning about the crime, and thereby waive his right to counsel, by asking an innocuous question about the welfare of his stepchildren. Admission of statements taken in violation of the <em>Miranda </em>rights to silence and to counsel violate the defendant\u2019s rights guaranteed by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-10\">{\u00b6 191} Eighth Proposition of Law: The introduction of gruesome photographs with no probative value but which are highly prejudicial violates a capital defendant\u2019s right to a fair trial, due process, and a reliable determination of guilt as guaranteed by the Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Sections 9, 10 and 16, Article I of the Ohio Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-11\">{\u00b6 192} Ninth Proposition of Law: Trial counsel\u2019s performance is deficient when they permit the readmission of all trial phase evidence into penalty phase and allow the trial court to instruct the jury to decide what evidence is admissible regarding the aggravating circumstances to appellant\u2019s prejudice. U.S. Const. Amends. VI, VIII, XIV; Ohio Const. Art. I, Section 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b467-12\">{\u00b6 193} Tenth Proposition of Law: A capital defendant\u2019s right to a fair and reliable trial is violated when the trial court instructs the jury to determine which <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"390\">*390</page-number>trial phase evidence is relevant to the aggravating circumstances in the penalty-phase. U.S. Const. Amend. VIII and XIV; Ohio Const. Art. I, Sections 9 and 16.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AeQ\">Mathias H. Heck Jr., Montgomery County Prosecuting Attorney, Kirsten Brandt and R. Lynn Nothstine, Assistant Prosecuting Attorneys, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"A9D\">David H. Bodiker, State Public Defender, Stephen A. Ferrell, Jane P. Perry, and Robert K. Lowe, Assistant Public Defenders, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<p id=\"b468-5\">{\u00b6 194} Eleventh Proposition of Law: The trial judge\u2019s failure to consider the mitigating factor of appellant\u2019s probable good adjustment to prison life violated the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment requirement that the sentencer must give consideration to all relevant mitigating evidence in a capital case.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-6\">{\u00b6 195} Twelfth Proposition of Law: A capital defendant is denied his substantive and procedural due process rights to a fair trial when a prosecutor commits acts of misconduct during the trial phase of his capital trial. He is also denied his right to reliable sentencing. U.S. Const. Amends. VIII, XIV; Ohio Const. Art. I, Sections 9 and 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-7\">{\u00b6 196} Thirteenth Proposition of Law: A capital defendant\u2019s right to due process is violated when the state is permitted to convict upon a standard of proof below proof beyond a reasonable doubt. U.S. Const. Amend. XIV; Ohio Const. Art. I, Section 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b468-8\">{\u00b6 197} Fourteenth Proposition of Law: Ohio\u2019s death penalty law is unconstitutional. R.C. 2903.01, 2929.02, 2929.021, 2929.022, 2929.023, 2929.03, 2929.04, and 2929.05 do not meet the prescribed constitutional requirements and are unconstitutional on their face as applied to Larry Gapen. U.S. Const. Amends. V, VI, VIII, XIV; Ohio Const. Art. I, Sections 2, 9, 10, 16. Further, Ohio\u2019s death penalty statute violates the United States\u2019 obligations under international law.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
