Rance </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 632, 710 N.E.2d 699, James A. Cooper\u2019s separate convictions for involuntary manslaughter and for child endangering constituted allied offenses of similar import and that, therefore, he could only be sentenced on the greater offense. The state contends that the trial court erred and seeks clarification of <em>Ranee </em>and a reversal of the decision reached by the court of appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-5\">{\u00b6 2} Here, we are called upon to revisit the allied-offense statute, R.C. 2941.25, and to clarify the law in the context of the facts of this case. After careful review, we have determined that the state presented evidence of two separate acts of child endangering \u2014 one involving slamming the infant\u2019s head against an object, as a predicate offense to the act of involuntary manslaughter, in violation of R.C. 2903.04, and the other involving shaking the infant, in violation of R.C. 2919.22. The jury returned verdicts finding Cooper guilty of involuntary manslaughter, involving one offense of child endangering, and a separate and distinct act of child endangering. Therefore, as explained below, we conclude that these acts are not the \u201csame conduct * * * constituting] two or more allied offenses of similar import\u201d within the meaning of R.C. 2941.25(A) and, thus, do not involve analysis under <em>State v. Rance.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">{\u00b6 3} On February 22, 2001, Cooper telephoned for emergency assistance and reported that Jordan McElhatten, his 18-month-old stepson, had fallen down a flight of stairs at his home and was having difficulty breathing. When the ambulance crew arrived, they found only Cooper and Jordan in the home and transported both to the Galion Community Hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-7\">{\u00b6 4} Upon assessment of Jordan\u2019s injuries in the emergency room, the medical team life-flighted Jordan to the MetroHealth Medical Center in Cleveland. There, Dr. Dennis Super, a pediatrician in the intensive-care unit, determined that Jordan had elevated intracranial pressure, or swelling of the brain. At trial, Dr. Super stated that Jordan had sustained one of the worst head injuries he had seen in his 18 years at that hospital and that the injuries were not, in his view, consistent with a fall down a padded flight of stairs. In his testimony, Dr. Super stated that the elevated intracranial pressure could have been caused by either a severe blow to the head or being shaken. Because of his suspicions, he consulted Dr. Thomas L. Steinemann, an ophthalmologist. Dr. Steinemann found \u201cmassive intraocular hemorrhage\u201d in Jordan\u2019s right eye and \u201cmultiple areas of retinal hemorrhages\u201d in the left eye and concluded that his findings were consistent with shaken-baby syndrome, rather than a fall down a flight of stairs.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-8\">{\u00b6 5} In determining how to alleviate the swelling in Jordan\u2019s brain, Dr. Judith Simon, a neuroradiologist, examined Jordan\u2019s CT scans. She testified that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>injuries as severe as Jordan\u2019s were typically seen in victims of high speed automobile accidents or falls from great heights and would not be typical of a fall down a flight of stairs. The CT scans revealed that the entire right side of Jordan\u2019s brain swelled, indicating that he had sustained a serious blow to the right side of his head. Dr. Roseanna Lechner, a neurosurgeon, completed several surgical procedures, including removal of part of Jordan\u2019s skull to alleviate the pressure by giving the brain more room to swell.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">{\u00b6 6} None of these efforts, however, proved successful, and as a result, doctors disconnected Jordan\u2019s life support. Cuyahoga County Deputy Coroner William Bligh-Glover performed an autopsy, which revealed that Jordan had bruises all over his body, but particularly on his face and head, which the coroner determined had been inflicted at the same time as the brain injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-6\">{\u00b6 7} The coroner further testified that Jordan \u201chad injuries to all the layers of the organs in the head,\u201d and he opined that Jordan\u2019s head and brain injuries could be attributed to either vigorous shaking or slamming the child against a hard surface. The autopsy report stated that Jordan died by homicide and noted the cause of death as \u201c[bjlunt impacts to [the] head with soft tissue and brain injuries.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">{\u00b6 8} Members of the Galion Police Department arrested Cooper, and the Crawford County Grand Jury returned a two-count indictment against him: the first for involuntary manslaughter with child endangering as the predicate felony offense and the second for child endangering in violation of R.C. 2919.22. The court conducted a jury trial, which resulted in convictions on both counts. Cooper argued that the two convictions constituted allied offenses of similar import under R.C. 2941.25. The trial court agreed and imposed sentence on only the conviction for involuntary manslaughter. Cooper appealed both convictions, and the state cross-appealed the trial court\u2019s ruling regarding allied offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-8\">{\u00b6 9} The appellate court affirmed Cooper\u2019s convictions and, relying on <em>State v. Ranee, </em>85 Ohio St.3d 632, 710 N.E.2d 699, upheld the trial court\u2019s allied-offense ruling. The state now appeals from that determination, arguing that involuntary manslaughter and child endangering are not allied offenses of similar import.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-9\">{\u00b6 10} The cause is now before this court upon our acceptance of a discretionary appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-10\">{\u00b6 11} In <em>State v. Rance, </em>we held that the prohibition against cumulative punishments contained in <em>Blockburger v. United States </em>(1932), 284 U.S. 299, 52 S.Ct. 180, 76 L.Ed. 306, does not apply where the General Assembly clearly intended to impose cumulative punishment. <em>Ranee, </em>at paragraph three of the syllabus. In determining legislative intent, we stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b374-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>{\u00b6 12} \u201cWe discern the General Assembly\u2019s intent on this subject through review of Ohio\u2019s multiple-count statute, R.C. 2941.25. If the court\u2019s sentencing of Ranee accords with the multiple-count statute, that harmony with the legislative intent precludes an \u2018unconstitutional\u2019 label. See <em>Albernaz [v. United States </em>(1981) ], 450 U.S. [333] at 344, 101 S.Ct. [1137] at 1145, 67 L.Ed.2d [275] at 285; <em>[State </em>v.] <em>Bickerstaff </em>[1984], 10 Ohio St.3d [62] at 65-66, 10 OBR [352] at 355-356, 461 N.E.2d [892] at 895-896. This court has stated that Ohio\u2019s multiple-count statute \u2018is a clear indication of the General Assembly\u2019s intent to permit cumulative sentencing for the commission of certain offenses.\u2019 <em>Id. </em>at 66, 10 OBR at 356, 461 N.E.2d at 896, fn. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">{\u00b6 13} \u201c[I]f a defendant commits offenses of similar import separately or with a separate animus, he may be punished for both pursuant to R.C. 2941.25(B). <em>State v. Jones </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 12, 13-14, 676 N.E.2d 80, 81.\u201d <em>Rance, </em>85 Ohio St.3d at 635-636, 710 N.E.2d 699.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-6\">{\u00b6 14} In this case, then, we look to R.C. 2941.25 to determine whether cumulative punishment is authorized. Ohio\u2019s multiple-count statute provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b374-7\">{\u00b6 15} \u201c(A) Where the <em>same conduct </em>by defendant can be construed to constitute two or more allied offenses of similar import, the indictment or information may contain counts for all such offenses, but the defendant may be convicted of only one.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-8\">{\u00b6 16} \u201c(B) Where the defendant\u2019s conduct constitutes two or more offenses of dissimilar import, or where his conduct results in two or more offenses of the same or similar kind <em>committed separately or with a separate animus </em>as to each, the indictment or information may contain counts for all such offenses, and the defendant may be convicted of all of them.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b374-9\">{\u00b6 17} Accordingly, a court need only engage in the allied-offense analysis when the same conduct, or single act, results in multiple convictions. We emphasized that point in <em>State v. Logan </em>(1979), 60 Ohio St.2d 126, 128, 14 O.O.3d 373, 397 N.E.2d 1345: \u201cIn addition to the requirement of similar import of the crimes committed, the defendant, in order to obtain the protection of R.C. 2941.25(A), <em>must show that the prosecution has relied upon the same conduct to support both offenses charged.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b374-10\">{\u00b6 18} We further elaborated in <em>State v. Jones </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 12, 14, 676 N.E.2d 80, where we stated:</p>\n<p id=\"b374-11\">{\u00b6 19} \u201cThis court has generally not found the presence or absence of any specific factors to be dispositive on the issue of whether crimes were committed separately or with a separate animus. * * * Instead, our approach has been to analyze the particular facts of each case before us to determine whether the acts or animus were separate. See <em>State v. Nicholas </em>(1993), 66 Ohio St.3d 431, 435, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"297\">*297</page-number>613 N.E.2d 225, 229; <em>State v. Hill </em>(1992), 64 Ohio St.3d 313, 332, 595 N.E.2d 884, 899-900; <em>State v. Jells </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 22, 33, 559 N.E.2d 464, 475; <em>Newark v. Vazirani </em>(1990), 48 Ohio St.3d 81, 83-84, 549 N.E.2d 520, 522; <em>State v. Powell </em>(1990), 49 Ohio St.3d 255, 262, 552 N.E.2d 191, 199.\u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"Az5\">{\u00b6 20} In <em>Logan, </em>we held that an offender must demonstrate the state\u2019s reliance on the same conduct to prove multiple charges before gaining the protection of R.C. 2941.25. Therefore, before we examine the facts of this case under R.C. 2941.25 and <em>Ranee, </em>we must determine whether the state proved that Cooper committed two distinct acts of child endangering \u2014 one as a predicate for involuntary manslaughter, which resulted in Jordan\u2019s death, and a separate act which did not result in death. In our analysis, we necessarily review the evidence that the state presented in this regard at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-6\">{\u00b6 21} At trial, the state presented evidence that Jordan had suffered several blunt impacts to the head and also exhibited signs of shaken-baby syndrome. The autopsy report noted that Jordan died as result of \u201c[b]lunt impacts to [the] head with soft tissue and brain injuries.\u201d The autopsy report detailed two skull fractures, a bruise on the left forehead, another bruise below the chin, an abrasion on the right forehead, a bruise on the right cheek, another bruise on the right forehead, and one bruise under the scalp, between the scalp and skull. These injuries culminated in the coroner\u2019s conclusion that Jordan sustained blunt trauma to the head, causing his death by homicide.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-7\">{\u00b6 22} At trial, Jordan\u2019s mother, Patricia McElhatten, testified that Jordan had no bruises on his chin or neck when she last saw him on February 22, 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-8\">{\u00b6 23} Also, Dr. Bligh-Glover, the deputy coroner, testified extensively regarding the injuries inflicted upon Jordan. He opined that Jordan had both coup and contrecoup contusions over many surfaces of his brain. The doctor explained that coup contusions appear on the brain directly under the point of impact when there is a direct blow to the head. Contrecoup contusions, however, occur on the side of the brain directly opposite of the point of impact because the brain is suspended in fluid and will press up against the opposite side of the skull before moving back to the side where the impact occurred. Dr. Bligh-Glover explained how the injuries to Jordan\u2019s brain could have occurred:</p>\n<p id=\"b375-9\">{\u00b6 24} \u201cThe type of injuries that I saw on Jordan could have occurred in two ways. The first part is the shaking of the shaken baby syndrome. When you shake a kid very vigorously \u2014 and kids\u2019 heads, as I said, are heavy. Their necks are weak. And the head bounces back and forth and gives this acceleration/deceleration in the skull.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"298\">*298</page-number>{\u00b6 25} \u201cThen, finally, there is the impact phase. When the shaking is finished, the baby is limp and unconscious and lands against a hard surface.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">{\u00b626} Further, Dr. Steinemann, an ophthalmologist, examined Jordan and, based on the massive intraocular hemorrhage in the right eye and the multiple areas of retinal hemorrhages in the left eye, found that these injuries were \u201cconsistent with shaken baby syndrome.\u201d And Dr. Bligh-Glover testified that \u201cretinal hemorrhaging in the pattern that [he] saw in Jordan McElhatten, throughout the back of the retina, is considered to be pathognomonic, proof positive, of shaken impact syndrome.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">{\u00b6 27} The state claimed in its opening statement and presented evidence at trial that Cooper, had committed two acts of violence against Jordan \u2014 slamming his head against a hard surface and shaking him. The state offered separate medical testimony as to each act. Dr. Bligh-Glover\u2019s testimony and the autopsy report proved that Cooper caused Jordan\u2019s death by either striking him or slamming him against a hard object. The testimony offered by Doctors Super, Steinemann, and Bligh-Glover proved that Cooper endangered Jordan\u2019s life by vigorously shaking him.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">{\u00b628} Based on the foregoing, the record reflects that the state presented evidence at trial demonstrating that Cooper committed two separate acts, slamming Jordan against a hard surface and shaking him; accordingly, the state did not rely on the same conduct to prove two offenses. Additionally, the court instructed the jury to consider the evidence pertaining to each count separately. The jurors returned verdicts finding Cooper guilty of both offenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">{\u00b6 29} Here, Cooper\u2019s convictions did not originate from a single act, but rather, in accordance with the evidence, from his separate acts of slamming Jordan against a hard surface, which provided the basis of the underlying offense of child endangering in connection with the involuntary manslaughter conviction, and shaking Jordan, as a separate count of child endangering. Our decision does not alter our holding in <em>Ranee, </em>because <em>Ranee </em>is not implicated by the facts of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">{\u00b6 30} Therefore, we hold that R.C. 2941.25(A) applies when the state obtains multiple convictions arising out of the same conduct of a defendant that can be construed to constitute two or more allied offenses of similar import. Where the state has not relied upon the same conduct of the defendant to support a conviction for the offense of involuntary manslaughter involving child endangering and a separate conviction for child endangering, the defendant may be convicted of both crimes and sentenced on each.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-10\">{\u00b6 31} The judgment of the appellate court is reversed, and this cause is remanded for further proceedings in accordance with our opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-11\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"Aa4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"299\">*299</page-number>Stanley Flegm, Crawford County Prosecuting Attorney, and Clifford Murphy, Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellant.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AuBA\">John Spiegel, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<judges id=\"b377-5\">Resnick, Lundberg Stratton and O\u2019Connor, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b377-6\">Moyer, C.J., dissents.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b377-7\">F.E.
