The General Assembly has not authorized an Ohio court of common pleas to exercise jurisdiction over the prosecution of a defendant for the crime of aggravated murder when, as here, the killing occurred in another state. As a result, it is our duty to reverse the convictions of aggravated murder and vacate the death sentences imposed on defendant-appellant, Terrell Yarbrough. We do, however, affirm multiple other convictions, including convictions for robbery, burglary, and kidnapping, and a total prison sentence of 59 years for those crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-11\">{\u00b6 2} Moreover, we note that Yarbrough may yet be tried in an appropriate court for crimes relating to the deaths of the men he victimized. We are not aware of any precedent that would prevent Pennsylvania, whose law also provides for the death penalty, from trying appellant for the abhorrent murders of the two college students. See <em>Heath v. Alabama </em>(1985), 474 U.S. 82, 106 S.Ct. 433, 88 L.Ed.2d 387; 18 Pa.Consol.Stat.Ann. 112(1) and 1102.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-12\">{\u00b6 3} The genesis of the error that mandates this reversal appears to be the prosecutor\u2019s failure to distinguish between the venue statute and the jurisdiction statute in drafting the indictment. Incorrectly relying on the language of the venue statute, both the state and the defense proceeded \u2014 indeed, through the appeal to this court \u2014 under the assumption that Ohio courts had subject-matter jurisdiction to try Yarbrough for aggravated murder when the homicides did not occur in Ohio, but in Pennsylvania. The Ohio <em>jurisdiction </em>statute, however\u2014 because of the limited manner in which the General Assembly has drafted it\u2014 simply does not provide jurisdiction over homicides that occur outside the borders of Ohio. See R.C. 2901.11.</p>\n<p id=\"b79-13\">{\u00b6 4} Nothing in the record reflects that the defense counsel or the trial court ever recognized this error \u2014 despite the fact that the prosecutor was seeking the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"2\">*2</page-number>death penalty. It was not until our review of the record and our request for supplemental briefing that the issue of the jurisdiction of the trial court over the aggravated-murder charges was addressed. See <em>State v. Lomax, </em>96 Ohio St.3d 318, 2002-Ohio-4453, 774 N.E.2d 249, \u00b6 17 (subject-matter jurisdiction cannot be waived and may be raised by this court, sua sponte, on appeal). One would expect that those charged with the responsibility of participating in the prosecution of a defendant who is subject to the ultimate penalty would exercise more diligence. In failing to observe the General Assembly\u2019s statutory rules of jurisdiction, these attorneys disserved the citizens of Ohio and, in particular, the victims of these abhorrent crimes.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-5\">{\u00b6 5} Despite the time that has passed since the homicides were committed in Pennsylvania, despite overwhelming evidence that the defendant participated in the murders, and despite the anguish suffered by the family and friends of the victims, it is our responsibility as members of this court to preserve the integrity of the criminal-justice system in Ohio. To that end, our decision follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-6\">\n<em>State\u2019s case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b80-7\">{\u00b6 6} Aaron Land, age 20, Brian Muha, age 18, and Andrew Doran were college students living in a street-level apartment at 165 McDowell Avenue in Steubenville. On May 30, 1999, Muha parked his mother\u2019s Chevrolet Blazer outside the apartment. During the early morning hours of May 31, 1999, Land and Doran were asleep in their bedrooms, and Muha was asleep on the living room couch.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-8\">{\u00b6 7} Around 5:00 a.m. on May 31, Yarbrough and Nathan Herring broke into the house and woke up Land and Muha by repeatedly hitting them with a pistol. Yarbrough and Herring then demanded the keys to the Blazer, and Muha gave them the keys.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-9\">{\u00b6 8} Doran, awakened by the noise of \u201ca loud series of crashes,\u201d crawled out a window and reentered the house by a side door. Doran then saw a black male with a white handkerchief over his mouth and a hood pulled over his head, who looked at Doran and said, \u201cOh, f* * *, we have another one here.\u201d Doran then ran to a nearby residence and called the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-10\">{\u00b6 9} Yarbrough and Herring forced Land and Muha out of the house and into the back seat of the Blazer and drove towards Pittsburgh. During the trip, Yarbrough forced Land and Muha to engage in oral sex.</p>\n<p id=\"b80-11\">{\u00b6 10} In Washington County, Pennsylvania (near Pittsburgh), Yarbrough and Herring stopped the Blazer on the highway berm. Yarbrough forced the victims out of the car and into a forested area and separately shot them in the head with a .44-caliber handgun. The bodies appeared to have been placed under a bush in an area of thick vegetation. Yarbrough and Herring then took Muha\u2019s automatic-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"3\">*3</page-number>teller-machine (\u201cATM\u201d) card and some cash, walked back to the Blazer, and drove to Pittsburgh.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-4\">{\u00b6 11} Around 6:30 a.m. on May 31, Yarbrough and Herring stopped at an ATM in Pittsburgh and unsuccessfully attempted to withdraw cash using Muha\u2019s ATM card.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-5\">{\u00b6 12} During the early afternoon of May 31, Yarbrough and Herring went to the Squirrel Hill section of Pittsburgh to steal a second car. They saw Barbara Vey leave her house and drive away in a green BMW. Vey returned to her third-floor apartment in the house 10 to 15 minutes later.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-6\">{\u00b6 13} As Vey was leaving her apartment again, Yarbrough and Herring attacked her on a stairwell landing. Yarbrough demanded the keys to Vey\u2019s car, while Herring pointed a gun at Vey and screamed, \u201cI\u2019m going to kill you.\u201d Yarbrough then stood between Herring and Vey and said, \u201cDon\u2019t shoot her.\u201d After Vey told Yarbrough and Herring that the car keys were in her apartment, they walked up to her apartment, and Vey gave the keys to Yarbrough. Before departing, Yarbrough told Vey, \u201cI saw you earlier and I wanted you to be my girlfriend,\u201d and lifted Vey\u2019s chin and kissed her. After Yarbrough and Herring left, Vey called the police.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-7\">{\u00b6 14} Later that afternoon, Yarbrough drove the Blazer back to Steubenville, and Herring drove the BMW to Steubenville. En route, Yarbrough ran out of gas. Brian Porter, a passing motorist, stopped and gave him a ride to a nearby gas station. Yarbrough told Porter that he was from Pittsburgh, that he was traveling with another man who was driving a BMW, and that the other driver \u201cjust kept going\u201d after Yarbrough ran out of gas.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-8\">{\u00b6 15} After returning to Steubenville, Yarbrough met with a friend, Brandon Young, and they drove around together in the Blazer. Young asked Yarbrough where he had gotten the Blazer, and Yarbrough said that he had \u201cmade a lick\u201d (i.e., committed a robbery). Yarbrough told Young that he and Herring had broken into a house and had \u201cstarted beating on \u2019em with a gun.\u201d Yarbrough said he pushed the two victims into the Blazer and \u201ctook them up to the woods or mountains.\u201d Yarbrough said he \u201cdid two domies\u201d (i.e., two head shots). Yarbrough also said he made the victims perform oral sex on each other before he killed them.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-9\">{\u00b6 16} Steubenville police officers dispatched to 165 McDowell found the house in disarray, with furniture knocked over and blood in the living room, on the bedding, and on the wall in Land\u2019s bedroom. There were no signs of forced entry. Steubenville police broadcast the description and license number of the missing Blazer to their colleagues and other law enforcement agencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"4\">*4</page-number>{\u00b6 17} Around 6:00 p.m. on May 31, Steubenville police officers followed the Blazer into a parking lot. Yarbrough and Young fled the Blazer and ran down the street. After a short chase, Yarbrough was arrested. Around 8:00 p.m. on May 31, the police recovered Vey\u2019s BMW in Steubenville.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-4\">{\u00b6 18} Around 7:00 p.m. on May 31, Steubenville detectives interviewed Yarbrough and advised him of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and he waived those rights. During this interview, Yarbrough lied about his identity and his whereabouts on May 31. He denied involvement in the theft of the Blazer or any knowledge about the missing students. Police also seized a religious necklace Yarbrough was wearing, which was later identified as Muha\u2019s.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-5\">{\u00b6 19} On the morning of June 2, 1999, the police apprehended and questioned Young and Herring. Later that afternoon, Yarbrough \u2014 who was still in custody \u2014 informed the police that he wished to speak to them again. Police detectives interviewed Yarbrough around 3:00 p.m. that day. Following advisement and waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, Yarbrough admitted his involvement in the theft of the Blazer and the abduction of Land and Muha. However, Yarbrough claimed that Herring and Young had shot and killed the two victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-6\">{\u00b6 20} On June 3, police discovered evidence linking the Steubenville and Pittsburgh crimes. On that date, Pennsylvania State Police found an ATM receipt from Muha\u2019s account underneath the front seat of Vey\u2019s BMW. The receipt showed an attempted transaction from an ATM in Pittsburgh at 6:35 a.m. on May 31, 1999. Police later obtained a videotape showing Yarbrough attempting to use the ATM at around 6:35 a.m. on May 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-7\">{\u00b6 21} On the evening of June 3, 1999, Pittsburgh police officers interviewed Yarbrough in Steubenville. Following another advisement and waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights, Yarbrough again admitted his involvement in the theft of the Blazer and the abduction of Land and Muha. Yarbrough claimed that Young had forced Muha and Land to commit oral sex while they were in the vehicle. Yarbrough then claimed that Herring had ordered the victims out of the Blazer, had forced them to walk up a hill, and had shot both victims in the head.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-8\">{\u00b6 22} During this interview, Yarbrough agreed to show the police the location of the bodies. Although it was getting dark, Yarbrough took the police to a spot along a highway berm in Washington County, Pennsylvania. On June 4, police found the bodies lying in heavy undergrowth, directly uphill from where Yarbrough had taken them. Land\u2019s pants were unbuttoned and partially unzipped when the police found his body.</p>\n<p id=\"b82-9\">{\u00b6 23} During a search of the Blazer, police found two .44-caliber bullets in its front console. At trial, an FBI materials-analysis examiner testified that the composition of a lead bullet fragment recovered from Muha\u2019s body was analytically indistinguishable from the metallic composition of the .44-caliber cartridges <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"5\">*5</page-number>found in the Blazer. An FBI fingerprint specialist identified Yarbrough\u2019s fingerprints on the inside and the exterior of the Blazer.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-4\">{\u00b6 24} An FBI forensic DNA examiner concluded that Yarbrough was the contributor of DNA material obtained from a cigarette butt found in the Blazer\u2019s ashtray. The probability of selecting an unrelated individual at random with the same DNA profile was one in 24 billion in the black population. The DNA examiner also found that Land was the source of DNA in three bloodstains on Yarbrough\u2019s sweatpants. Additionally, Muha was the possible contributor of DNA from blood found on Yarbrough\u2019s socks.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-5\">{\u00b6 25} A forensic pathologist concluded that Muha had died from a single close-range gunshot wound to the right side of his head. Muha\u2019s upper and lower jaws were also broken, but not by the gunshot. Land died from a single close-range bullet that entered his head behind his ear. Both victims had been shot by a .40- or .44-caliber gun.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-6\">{\u00b6 26} James Jones Jr., one of Yarbrough\u2019s former cellmates at the Jefferson County jail in 1999, testified that Yarbrough told him that he had shot one of the victims in the head and saw \u201cthe bullet exit outside his head.\u201d Yarbrough also admitted that \u201c[h]e made them do oral sex on the way there.\u201d According to Jones, Yarbrough also said that \u201che was going to say that Boo [Herring] held a gun to his head and forced him to shoot one of them.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-7\">{\u00b6 27} Sean Dudley, another 1999 county-jail cellmate, testified that Yarbrough told him that he had kidnapped the two victims and had \u201cwalked them * * * into the forest and he shot both of them.\u201d According to Dudley, Yarbrough also said that he \u201cmade them suck each other\u2019s privates.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b83-8\">{\u00b6 28} Phillip Thompson, another 1999 cellmate, testified that Yarbrough \u201cjoked about kidnapping [the two victims] and * * * looking for a place to take them to Pa[.] and shoot them.\u201d Yarbrough \u201cwent on to say that * * * he shot * * * both guys * * * with one bullet straight through the head without them saying a word.\u201d According to Thompson, Yarbrough also said that Herring threw the murder weapon into the river.</p>\n<p id=\"b83-9\">\n<em>Defense case</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b83-10\">{\u00b6 29} Dr. Thomas Huard, Ph.D., a DNA analyst for the Speckin Forensic Laboratories in Michigan, reviewed FBI crime-lab results on DNA testing. Dr. Huard verified the presence of Herring\u2019s DNA on a variety of evidence, including items from the Blazer, the BMW, and Herring\u2019s home. Of 40 pieces of evidence examined, Dr. Huard testified that Herring\u2019s DNA was found on 12 to 15 items and that Yarbrough\u2019s DNA was found on two items. He also found that Young\u2019s DNA did not match any of the evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"6\">*6</page-number>{\u00b6 30} Dr. Huard confirmed that Yarbrough\u2019s DNA was on a cigarette butt found in the Blazer. Dr. Huard also found no direct evidence that Muha\u2019s DNA was on Yarbrough\u2019s socks since no usable DNA was obtained from Muha. Instead, DNA samples from Muha\u2019s parents were used in testing. Thus, according to Huard, the FBI\u2019s finding that Muha\u2019s DNA matched the DNA on Yarbrough\u2019s socks was a match by inference.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-4\">\n<em>Trial result</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">{\u00b6 31} Yarbrough was charged with 12 counts of aggravated felony-murder, and eight other related felony counts. He pleaded not guilty to all charges. Yarbrough was found guilty of all counts and sentenced to death.

Herring was sentenced to two life terms in prison without the possibility of parole for their murders. The court of appeals affirmed the judgment of the trial court. <em>State v. Herring, </em>Jefferson App. No. 00 JE 37, 2002-Ohio-2786.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-8\">{\u00b6 33} Yarbrough now appeals to this court as a matter of right.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">\n<em>Jurisdiction</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b85-10\">{\u00b6 34} R.C. 2901.11, Ohio\u2019s criminal-law jurisdiction statute reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b85-11\">{\u00b6 35} \u201c(A) A person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in this state if any of the following occur:</p>\n<p id=\"b85-12\">{\u00b6 36} \u201c(1) The person commits an offense under the laws of this state, any element of which takes place in this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-13\">{\u00b6 37} \u201c(2) While in this state, the person conspires or attempts to commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in another jurisdiction, which offense is an offense under both the laws of this state and the other jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-14\">{\u00b6 38} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b85-15\">{\u00b6 39} \u201c(B) In homicide, the element referred to in division (A)(1) of this section is either the act that causes death, or the physical contact that causes death, or the death itself. If any part of the body of a homicide victim is found in this state, the death is presumed to have occurred within this state.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-16\">{\u00b6 40} \u201c* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b85-17\">{\u00b6 41} \u201c(D) When an offense is committed under the laws of this state, and it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the offense took place either in this state or in another jurisdiction or jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place, the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this state for purposes of this section.\u201d (Boldface added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b85-18\">{\u00b6 42} It is true that the 1973 Ohio Legislative Service Commission comment attached to R.C. 2901.11 states that the enactment is intended to grant Ohio courts \u201cthe broadest possible jurisdiction over crimes and persons committing crimes in or affecting this state, consistent with constitutional limitations.\u201d The language of R.C. 2901.11, however, controls.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-19\">{\u00b6 43} Under the \u201cany element\u201d rule in R.C. 2901.11(A)(1), a person may be tried for an offense in Ohio if he or she commits any element of the offense within <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"8\">*8</page-number>Ohio\u2019s boundaries. However, R.C. 2901.11(B) narrows the scope of \u201cany element\u201d in homicide cases to \u201ceither the act that causes death, or the physical contact that causes death, or the death itself.\u201d See, also, 2 Katz &amp; Giannelli Criminal Law (2d Ed.2003), Section 55:4.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">{\u00b6 44} The felony portion of the aggravated murder charges against Yarbrough began with the burglary, robbery, and kidnapping of the victims in Ohio. However, undisputed evidence established that Muha and Land were shot in Washington County, Pennsylvania. Here, the act causing the deaths, the physical contact causing the deaths, and the deaths themselves all occurred in Pennsylvania. Thus, under a plain reading of R.C. 2901.11, particularly R.C. 2901.11(B), Ohio does not have statutory jurisdiction over the homicides of Land and Muha.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">{\u00b6 45} The wording of the indictment and the trial court\u2019s instructions refer to Yarbrough\u2019s \u201ccourse of criminal conduct\u201d as the basis for jurisdiction over the aggravated murders in Pennsylvania. However, the General Assembly did not include \u201ccourse of criminal conduct\u201d in R.C. 2901.11, the jurisdiction statute.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">{\u00b6 46} Apparently, the prosecutor and the trial judge misconstrued the \u201ccourse of criminal conduct\u201d provisions in R.C. 2901.12(H), the state\u2019s venue statute, as applicable to jurisdiction over the homicides. But the state\u2019s venue statute provides no basis for asserting jurisdiction over out-of-state murder offenses. R.C. 2901.12(H) provides, \u201cWhen an offender, as part of a course of criminal conduct, commits offenses in different jurisdictions, the offender may be tried for all of those offenses in any jurisdiction in which one of those offenses or any element of one of those offenses occurred.\u201d However, as the Legislative Service Committee comments to R.C. 2901.12 state, \u201cThis section <em>presupposes that the state has jurisdiction to try an offender, </em>and speaks to the question of where the trial is to take place.\u201d (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">{\u00b6 47} Each of the murder counts in the indictment improperly sets forth course of criminal conduct as the basis for jurisdiction as follows: \u201cTHE JURORS OF THE GRAND JURY of the State of Ohio * * * do find and present that on or about May 31, 1999, at Jefferson County, Ohio, and/or <em>as part of a course of criminal conduct </em>in which the offender committed the offense in different jurisdictions, and/or any element of the offense occurred in Jefferson County, Ohio, and/or the offense involved the same victim and/or was committed as part of the same transaction or chain of events or in furtherance of the same purpose or objective, and/or the offense or any element of the offense was committed in a motor vehicle in transit and it cannot reasonably be determined in which jurisdiction the offense was committed, TERRELL YARBROUGH, aka MICHAEL POOLE did, purposely cause the death of another * * (Emphasis added.) The indictment did not charge that \u201cthe act that cause[d] death, or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"9\">*9</page-number>the physical contact that cause[d] death, or the death itself\u2019 occurred in Ohio as required to invoke jurisdiction under R.C. 2901.11(B). Yet it is these facts upon which the exercise of jurisdiction over homicide charges depends.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\">{\u00b6 48} Challenges to statutory jurisdiction under R.C. 2901.11 have been raised in other interstate murder cases. In <em>State v. Rydbom </em>(Apr. 14, 1998), Washington App. No. 97CA16, 1998 WL 177541, murder charges were dismissed for lack of jurisdiction under R.C. 2901.11 where the facts established that the victim was murdered in West Virginia and the body was moved to Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">{\u00b6 49} In contrast, Ohio jurisdiction has been upheld under R.C. 2901.11(D) in several cases in which the murder victim was found out of state, and there was evidence that the murder occurred in Ohio or the location of the murder could not be determined. See <em>State v. Hubbard </em>(Feb. 5, 2001), Butler App. No. CA99-12222, 2001 WL 121122 (defendant killed girlfriend in Ohio and moved body to Tennessee); <em>State v. Phelps </em>(Sept. 19, 1996), Cuyahoga App. No. 69157, 1996 WL 532092 (blow causing death occurred in Ohio and the body was found in Pennsylvania); <em>State v. Boyle </em>(Sept. 26, 1991), Richland App. No. CA-2784, 1991 WL 208063 (wife murdered at Ohio residence and her remains found in Pennsylvania). Unlike in those cases, the evidence in this case unmistakably shows that Land and Muha were not shot and killed in Ohio.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">{\u00b6 50} Other states have enacted legislation that provides a more expansive basis for trying out-of-state murders. Specific provisions of these state\u2019s jurisdictional statutes permit jurisdiction over murders committed under circumstances similar to those here.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> But in Ohio, the General Assembly has not conferred jurisdiction over homicides that occur outside of Ohio. See R.C. 2901.11(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-7\">{\u00b6 51} Finding jurisdiction over Yarbrough\u2019s killing of Land and Muha in Pennsylvania would require us to overlook the plain language of R.C. 2901.11(B), which defines the term \u201celement\u201d of the offense in homicide cases. Accordingly, we conclude that the trial court did not have subject-matter jurisdiction over Yarbrough\u2019s killing of Land and Muha in Pennsylvania under R.C. 2901.11(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">{\u00b6 52} In their supplemental brief and at oral argument, Yarbrough\u2019s appellate attorneys suggested that Yarbrough could be indicted and tried in Ohio for complicity to murder Land and Muha. See R.C. 2901.11(A)(2). However, we find <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"10\">*10</page-number>that Yarbrough cannot be tried for complicity to commit aggravated murder of Land and Muha.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">\u25a0 {\u00b6 53} To be sure, R.C. 2901.11(A)(2) gives Ohio trial courts the power to hear cases where the defendant, \u201c[wjhile in this state, * * * conspire[d], or attempted] to commit, or * * * is guilty of complicity in the commission of\u2019 an out-of-state crime. In other words, as long as the conspiracy, the attempt, or the complicity occurred in Ohio, the fact that the related crime or attempted crime occurred or was supposed to occur elsewhere does not generally deprive Ohio courts of their jurisdiction to hear the conspiracy or attempt or complicity charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-5\">{\u00b6 54} Homicide cases are treated differently in the criminal-jurisdiction statute, however. As we explained above, R.C. 2901.11(B) says that \u201cthe act that causes death, or the physical contact that causes death, or the death itself\u2019 must occur in Ohio if an Ohio trial court is to have jurisdiction to hear criminal homicide charges. The express and distinct provision governing jurisdiction in homicide prosecutions trumps the general language in the statute about Ohio courts\u2019 jurisdiction to hear conspiracy, attempt, and complicity charges involving myriad crimes. See <em>State ex rel. Belknap v. Lavelle </em>(1985), 18 Ohio St.3d 180, 182, 18 OBR 248, 480 N.E.2d 758 (\u201cIt is a well-established rule of construction that specific provisions prevail over general provisions\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b88-6\">{\u00b6 55} The jurisdiction that the General Assembly has created for homicide cases makes no exception for murder cases like Yarbrough\u2019s to be tried in Ohio. Under R.C. 2901.11, a murderer acting alone who plans his crime in Ohio and carries it out in another state cannot be tried in Ohio for his or her crime. We read nothing in the statutes that would produce a different result when the murderer plans the crime in Ohio with others before leaving the state to commit the homicide itself. The state is not permitted, in other words, to evade the express jurisdictional limit on homicide cases by recasting a homicide case as a complicity-to-commit homicide case that could, under R.C. 2923.03(F), carry the same penalty as the crime of homicide itself.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-7\">{\u00b6 56} Section 4(B), Article IV, of the Ohio Constitution gives the General Assembly the power to decide how broad or narrow the jurisdiction of the common pleas courts will be, and the General Assembly has chosen to set special limits on the power of those courts to hear homicide cases. We must respect that choice, for our \u201crole is to interpret, not legislate.\u201d <em>Cablevision of the Midwest, Inc. v. Gross </em>(1994), 70 Ohio St.3d 541, 544, 639 N.E.2d 1154. Because the Land and Muha killings occurred in Pennsylvania, Ohio had no jurisdiction to hear any criminal charges involving those homicides.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">{\u00b6 57} Hence, we vacate Yarbrough\u2019s convictions for aggravated murder in Counts 6 through 11 and Counts 13 through 18 of the indictment and dismiss <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"11\">*11</page-number>those counts for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction under R.C. 2901.11. However, we find that Ohio jurisdiction extends to Counts 1 through 5 (robbery, burglary, kidnapping of Land and Muha, and gross sexual imposition), Count 12 (the robbery of Vey), and Count 20 (theft of the Blazer).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">\n<em>Pretrial issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">{\u00b6 58} <em>Change of venue. </em>In proposition of law XIII, Yarbrough argues that the trial court erred by denying the defense motion for a change of venue.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">{\u00b6 59} Yarbrough asserts that extensive media coverage following the murders of Land and Muha, coupled with the publicity surrounding the earlier trial of co-defendant, Nathan Herring, irreparably tainted his jury and denied him a fair trial. In support of this motion, trial defense counsel asserted that \u201c[t]he television news, the local newspapers and the radio have made countless reports in reference to this case. The Sheriff, Prosecutor and families of the victim have appeared on the televised news, and made statements in print, regaling the community with the details of the crime.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">{\u00b6 60} A motion for change of venue is governed by Crim.R. 18(B), which provides, \u201cUpon the motion of any party or upon its own motion the court may transfer an action * * * when it appears that a fair and impartial trial cannot be held in the court in which the action is pending.\u201d However, Crim.R. 18(B) does not require a change of venue merely because of extensive pretrial publicity. Any decision on a change of venue rests in the trial court\u2019s discretion. <em>State v. Lynch, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 514, 2003-Ohio-2284, 787 N.E.2d 1185, \u00b634; <em>State v. Landrum </em>(1990), 53 Ohio St.3d 107, 116-117, 559 N.E.2d 710.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">{\u00b6 61} We have stated that a \u201c \u2018careful and searching <em>voir dire </em>provides the best test of whether prejudicial pretrial publicity has prevented obtaining a fair and impartial jury from the locality.\u2019 \u201d <em>Landrum, </em>53 Ohio St.3d at 117, 559 N.E.2d 710, quoting <em>State v. Bayless </em>(1976), 48 Ohio St.2d 73, 98, 2 O.O.3d 249, 357 N.E.2d 1035. A defendant claiming that pretrial publicity has denied him a fair trial must show that one or more jurors were actually biased. <em>State v. Treesh </em>(2001), 90 Ohio St.3d 460, 464, 739 N.E.2d 749. Only in rare cases may prejudice be presumed. <em>State v. Lundgren </em>(1995), 73 Ohio St.3d 474, 479, 653 N.E.2d 304; see, also, <em>Nebraska Press Assn. v. Stuart </em>(1976), 427 U.S. 539, 554, 96 S.Ct. 2791, 49 L.Ed.2d 683.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-9\">{\u00b6 62} Our review of the voir dire examination does not support Yarbrough\u2019s claim of prejudicial pretrial publicity. During voir dire, all of the seated jurors <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"12\">*12</page-number>acknowledged hearing or seeing some news coverage about the case. However, they also stated that they could set aside whatever they may have read or heard about the case and would decide the case solely upon the evidence presented at trial. See <em>Landrum, </em>53 Ohio St.3d at 117, 559 N.E.2d 710.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">{\u00b6 63} Following voir dire, the defense did not challenge any of the seated jurors for cause due to pretrial publicity. The absence of any defense challenges for pretrial publicity against any of the seated jurors shows that, after voir dire examination, the defense was not particularly troubled by the jury\u2019s exposure to pretrial publicity. See <em>Lynch, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 514, 2003-Ohio-2284, 787 N.E.2d 1185, \u00b6 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">{\u00b6 64} Yarbrough has failed to show that the trial court abused its discretion in denying the defense motion for a change of venue. We reject proposition XIII.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">{\u00b6 65} <em>Discovery. </em>In proposition of law XI, Yarbrough asserts that the state failed to disclose exculpatory and impeaching evidence in violation of <em>Brady v. Maryland </em>(1963), 373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215; <em>United States v. Bagley </em>(1985), 473 U.S. 667, 676, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 87 L.Ed.2d 481.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-7\">{\u00b6 66} Prior to trial, Yarbrough\u2019s counsel asked the prosecuting attorney to disclose all evidence, known or which might become known to him, that was favorable to the defendant and material either to guilt or punishment, as required by Crim.R. 16(B)(1)(f). In responding to the discovery request, the state made available to the defense the statements of witnesses and other information.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-8\">{\u00b6 67} On September 22, 2000, the day the jury returned its verdicts, a man, John H. Butler Jr., told defense counsel about an earlier assault on his son involving Herring, Young, and Brandon Crawford. Butler reported that on May 29, 1999, Herring, Young, and Crawford struck Butler\u2019s 22-year-old son with a scoped .44-caliber handgun. He also said that Herring, Young, and Crawford later stalked his home. According to Butler, he reported this incident to the Steubenville police and later learned from the police that \u201ca .38 caliber firearm and another * * * automatic weapon\u201d were recovered.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-9\">{\u00b6 68} On October 6, 2000, Yarbrough\u2019s counsel filed a motion for new trial because of the state\u2019s pretrial failure to provide the defense with this potentially exculpatory evidence concerning the Butler assault. On November 6, 2000, the trial court denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-10\">{\u00b6 69} Suppression by the prosecution of evidence that is favorable to the accused and \u201cmaterial either to guilt or to punishment\u201d is a violation of due process. <em>Brady, </em>373 U.S. at 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215. Evidence suppressed by the prosecution is material within the meaning of <em>Brady </em>only if there exists a \u201c \u2018reasonable probability\u2019 \u201d that the result of the trial would have been different had the evidence been disclosed to the defense. <em>Kyles v. Whitley </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"13\">*13</page-number>(1995), 514 U.S. 419, 433-434, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 131 L.Ed.2d 490, quoting <em>Bagley, </em>473 U.S. at 682, 105 S.Ct. 3375, 87 L.Ed.2d 481. As the United States Supreme Court has stressed, \u201cthe adjective [\u2018reasonable\u2019] is important. The question is not whether the defendant would more likely than not have received a different verdict with the evidence, but whether in its absence he received a fair trial, understood as a trial resulting in a verdict worthy of confidence.\u201d <em>Kyles, </em>514 U.S. at 434, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 131 L.Ed.2d 490; see, also, <em>State v. LaMar, </em>95 Ohio St.3d 181, 2002-Ohio-2128, 767 N.E.2d 166, \u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">{\u00b6 70} There is no indication that the prosecution \u201csuppressed\u201d the evidence Yarbrough complains about. Assuming, arguendo, that evidence of the Butler assault was suppressed, there was no due-process violation. Evidence that Herring, Young, and an unrelated third party struck Butler with a handgun did not exculpate Yarbrough as the offender in the burglary, robbery, and kidnapping of Land and Muha. The offenses were unrelated in time and involved different victims.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">{\u00b6 71} Even assuming Butler\u2019s assault was relevant under Evid.R. 401, Yarbrough fails to explain how that evidence would have been admissible. Butler\u2019s affidavit is hearsay. There is no indication that Butler had any firsthand knowledge about his son\u2019s assault, the weapons used, or whether Herring and Young were involved in this unrelated offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">{\u00b6 72} Based on the foregoing, we reject proposition XI.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">\n<em>Trial issues</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b91-10\">{\u00b6 73} <em>Gruesome photographs. </em>In proposition of law XIV, Yarbrough argues that the trial court erred by admitting, over defense objection, six crime-scene photographs of Land and Muha and one autopsy photo of Muha.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-11\">{\u00b6 74} Nonrepetitive photographs, even if gruesome, are admissible in capital cases as long as the probative value of each photograph outweighs the danger of material prejudice to the accused. <em>State v. Maurer </em>(1984), 15 Ohio St.3d 239, 15 OBR 379, 473 N.E.2d 768, paragraph seven of the syllabus; <em>State v. Morales </em>(1987), 32 Ohio St.3d 252, 257, 513 N.E.2d 267. Decisions on the admissibility of photographs are \u201cleft to the sound discretion of the trial court.\u201d <em>State v. Slagle </em>(1992), 65 Ohio St.3d 597, 601, 605 N.E.2d 916.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-12\">{\u00b6 75} We have held that the homicide convictions entered against Yarbrough must be vacated. Therefore we need not consider whether the photographs introduced at trial were probative of Yarbrough\u2019s guilt or innocence of the crime of aggravated murder.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-13\">{\u00b6 76} The photographs introduced at Yarbrough\u2019s trial did not have a prejudicial effect as to his convictions of burglary, robbery, kidnapping, and gross sexual imposition. Overwhelming evidence, including his police statement and admis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"14\">*14</page-number>sions of guilt to Young and several jailhouse cellmates established Yarbrough\u2019s guilt of these offenses. Moreover, forensic testimony linked Yarbrough to the victims and the crime scene, and he was driving the stolen Blazer at the time of his arrest. Based on the foregoing, we reject proposition XIV.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">{\u00b6 77} <em>Instructions on accomplice testimony. </em>In proposition of law XII, Yarbrough argues that the trial court erred by failing to instruct on the accomplice testimony of Brandon Young as required by R.C. 2923.03(D). However, Yarbrough failed to request such an instruction or object to the lack of such an instruction and thus waived all but plain error. Crim.R. 30(A) and 52(B); <em>State v. Long </em>(1978), 53 Ohio St.2d 91, 7 O.O.3d 178, 372 N.E.2d 804, paragraph one of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">{\u00b6 78} Young testified that Yarbrough had admitted burglarizing, robbing, kidnapping, and then killing Land and Muha. Further, Young testified that Yarbrough had said he made the victims \u201csuck each other\u2019s dick\u201d before he killed them. Young denied any involvement in the murders. However, Young acknowledged entering into a plea agreement in exchange for his truthful testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-6\">{\u00b6 79} The state maintained that Young was not involved in the murders. However, during the state\u2019s case-in-chief, the prosecutor introduced Yarbrough\u2019s pretrial statements to the police. In these statements, Yarbrough told police that Young had participated in the murders.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-7\">{\u00b6 80} R.C. 2923.03(D) states:</p>\n<p id=\"b92-8\">{\u00b6 81} \u201cIf an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the commission of * * * an offense, the court, when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:</p>\n<p id=\"b92-9\">{\u00b6 82} \u201c \u2018The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b92-10\">{\u00b6 83} As a result of Yarbrough\u2019s statements to the police, Young\u2019s credibility and status as an accomplice were before the jury, and the jury had to determine how much weight to give Young\u2019s testimony. However, we find no plain error. The defense was permitted wide latitude in cross-examining Young, and his plea agreement was presented to the jury. Moreover, the trial court\u2019s general instructions informed the jury how to weigh the credibility of the witnesses and included much of the substance of the statutory instruction on accomplices. See <em>State v. Sneed </em>(1992), 63 Ohio St.3d 3, 9-10, 584 N.E.2d 1160. Furthermore, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"15\">*15</page-number>overwhelming evidence established Yarbrough\u2019s guilt. Based on the foregoing, we reject proposition XII.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-4\">{\u00b6 84} <em>Juror misconduct. </em>In proposition of law XVIII, Yarbrough claims that one juror and two alternate jurors violated his right to a fair trial by having contact with the victims\u2019 families during the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-5\">{\u00b6 85} While the jury was deliberating during the guilt phase, the trial court was informed of reports of juror contact with the victims\u2019 families. The trial court then held a <em>Remmer </em>hearing to determine whether such improper contact had taken place. See <em>Remmer v. United States </em>(1954), 347 U.S. 227, 74 S.Ct. 450, 98 L.Ed. 654.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-6\">{\u00b6 86} Shantye Brown, a spectator at the trial, informed the court that when Juror Gallaher entered the jury box, Gallaher looked at a lady seated in the spectator section and \u201cput her thumb up and * * * turned her head and smiled.\u201d According to Brown, another spectator \u201ctold [Brown] it was one of the boy\u2019s moms.\u201d Upon questioning, Gallaher denied giving a thumbs-up signal to anyone in the courtroom. Gallaher said, \u201cI don\u2019t even know really truly who the victims\u2019 families are.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b93-7\">{\u00b6 87} During another alleged encounter over a lunch break, Brown observed one of the alternate jurors talking to \u201cthe families * * * on the other side.\u201d Brown also saw an alternate juror talking to one of the victims\u2019 family members during the lunch break. Chad Johnson, another spectator, said that he had observed two alternate jurors outside the courthouse and one of them was talking to a lady who Johnson thought was one of the victims\u2019 mothers. Finally, Doug Sibert, a spectator who was with Johnson, also said he saw an alternate juror talking to a lady outside the courthouse and that he had heard that \u201cshe was family.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b93-8\">{\u00b6 88} Juror Howell, one of the alternate jurors identified by the witnesses, denied talking to a lady or anyone else outside the front door of the courthouse during lunch. Joseph Antigo, the other alternate juror who was identified, also denied talking to anyone outside court.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-9\">{\u00b6 89} After hearing the witnesses, the trial court stated, \u201cI\u2019ve had occasion to interview everybody involved and quite frankly I don\u2019t think anything happened. I mean I don\u2019t see any problem here.\u201d The trial court then directed the jury to resume deliberations.</p>\n<p id=\"b93-10\">{\u00b6 90} A trial court may rely on a juror\u2019s testimony in determining that juror\u2019s impartiality. <em>State v. Herring </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 246, 259, 762 N.E.2d 940, citing <em>Smith v. Phillips </em>(1982), 455 U.S. 209, 217, 102 S.Ct. 940, 71 L.Ed.2d 78. Moreover, issues concerning the weight given to the evidence and the credibility of the witnesses are primarily for the trier of fact. <em>State v. DeHass </em>(1967), 10 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"16\">*16</page-number>Ohio St.2d 230, 39 O.O.2d 366, 227 N.E.2d 212, paragraph one of the syllabus. Here, the trial court\u2019s ruling reflects that the court believed the juror and the two alternate jurors and apparently did not believe the spectators. Given the trial court\u2019s finding that no contact occurred, Yarbrough has failed to demonstrate that any juror misconduct occurred. Proposition XVIII is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-5\">{\u00b6 91} <em>Alternate jurors in deliberations. </em>In proposition of law XVII, Yarbrough argues that the trial court erred by permitting alternate jurors to remain in the jury room during deliberations. We agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-6\">{\u00b6 92} However, the defense did not object to the alternates\u2019 presence during the jury\u2019s deliberations and thus waived all but plain error. <em>United States v. Olano </em>(1993), 507 U.S. 725, 741, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (permitting alternate jurors to attend deliberations was not reversible error under the federal \u201cplain error\u201d standard).

You\u2019ll be off somewhere where you can see and hear but not participate * * *.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b94-9\">{\u00b6 95} The trial court \u201cclearly erred\u201d by \u201callowing the alternate jurors to remain present during deliberations.\u201d <em>State v. Jackson </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 436, 439, 751 N.E.2d 946; see, also, <em>State v. Braden, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 354, 2003-Ohio-1325, 785 N.E.2d 439, at \u00b6 43-50; <em>State v. Murphy </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 516, 531, 747 N.E.2d 765. However, nothing in the record indicates that the alternates disobeyed the judge\u2019s instructions or that their presence chilled the deliberative process. Cf. <em>State v. Gross, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 121, 2002-Ohio-5524, 776 N.E.2d 1061, at \u00b6 129-134 (one alternate expressing feelings about other jurors and alternates \u201c \u2018throwing pens and things\u2019 \u201d during deliberations caused reversible error). Thus, we reject Proposition XVII.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-10\">{\u00b6 96} <em>Allied offenses. </em>In proposition of law XX, Yarbrough argues that he cannot be found guilty and sentenced for both receiving stolen property (the Blazer) and theft of that property because these crimes are allied offenses of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"17\">*17</page-number>similar import. However, the defense failed to raise this issue at trial and thus waived all but plain error. See <em>State v. Williams </em>(1977), 51 Ohio St.2d 112, 5 O.O.3d 98, 364 N.E.2d 1364, paragraph one of the syllabus; <em>State v.

Contrary to the state\u2019s claim that Count T9 related to Vey\u2019s BMW, the trial court\u2019s amended jury instructions specified that Muha\u2019s Blazer was the subject of Count 19.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-5\">{\u00b6 98} R.C. 2941.25(A) provides, \u201cWhere the same conduct by defendant can be construed to constitute two or more allied offenses of similar import, the indictment or information may contain counts for all such offenses, but the defendant may be convicted of only one.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b95-6\">{\u00b6 99} Although receiving stolen property is technically not a lesser included offense of theft, receiving stolen property and theft of the same property are clearly allied offenses of similar import. See <em>Maumee v. Geiger </em>(1976), 45 Ohio St.2d 238, 244, 74 O.O.2d 380, 344 N.E.2d 133; <em>State v. Botta </em>(1971), 27 Ohio St.2d 196, 204, 56 O.O.2d 119, 271 N.E.2d 776.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-7\">{\u00b6 100} The same facts were used to convict Yarbrough of stealing the Blazer and of receiving the Blazer as stolen property. Indeed, during closing argument summarizing the evidence on Counts 19 and 20, the prosecutor argued, \u201cGiven the testimony that you already know about the entry into 165 McDowell, and the burglary and the robbery and the kidnapping there\u2019s really no doubt that this Defendant stole that Chevy Blazer and was in possession of it and knew it was a stolen vehicle.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b95-8\">{\u00b6 101} Here, there was a single animus common to both offenses. Additionally, when the elements of each crime are aligned, the offenses \u201c \u2018correspond to such a degree that the commission of one crime\u2019 \u201d resulted \u201c \u2018in the commission of the other.\u2019 \u201d <em>State v. Rance </em>(1999), 85 Ohio St.3d 632, 638, 710 N.E.2d 699, quoting <em>State v. Jones </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 12, 14, 676 N.E.2d 80.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-9\">{\u00b6 102} Thus, convicting and sentencing Yarbrough both for receiving the stolen Blazer and for theft of the Blazer violated R.C. 2941.25(A). There was plain error affecting Yarbrough\u2019s \u201csubstantial rights,\u201d since he was sentenced to 18 months in prison for each offense. See <em>State v. Barnes </em>(2002), 94 Ohio St.3d 21, 27, 759 N.E.2d 1240.</p>\n<p id=\"b95-10\">{\u00b6 103} Proposition XX has merit. Yarbrough\u2019s conviction for receiving stolen property (Count 19) shall be merged into his conviction for grand theft (Count 20), Count 19 is dismissed, and the 18-month sentence that Yarbrough received for Count 19 is vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-3\">\n<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"18\">*18</page-number>\n<em>Prosecutorial Misconduct</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b96-4\">{\u00b6 104} In proposition of law XV, Yarbrough contends that he was denied a fair trial due to prosecutorial misconduct. However, unless otherwise noted, the defense did not object to the purported acts of prosecutorial misconduct and thus waived all but plain error. <em>State v. Slagle, </em>65 Ohio St.3d at 604, 605 N.E.2d 916.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-5\">{\u00b6 105} Guilt-phase testimony. Yarbrough complains that the prosecutor committed misconduct by eliciting testimony suggesting that Yarbrough was involved in gangs. Detective Lelless testified that when Yarbrough was interviewed on the day of the murders, Yarbrough was wearing a \u201cBaltimore Orioles hat with gang writing on the inside bill.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b96-6\">{\u00b6 106} Gang membership and gang motivation became an issue at trial. Testimony about gang writing on Yarbrough\u2019s hat was relevant in countering Yarbrough\u2019s claim that he was not a gang member. Such evidence rebutted the defense theory that Young, not Yarbrough, belonged to a gang and had a motive to kill the two victims. During cross-examination, a police detective testified that Young was a member of the \u201cBloods.\u201d The defense also asked the detective during cross-examination whether \u201cthose Bloods dislike non African-Americans.\u201d Cf. State <em>v. Franklin, </em>97 Ohio St.3d 1, 2002-Ohio-5304, 776 N.E.2d 26, \u00b626. Thus, there was no prosecutorial misconduct in asking about gang writing on Yarbrough\u2019s hat.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-7\">{\u00b6 107} Guilt-phase argument. First, Yarbrough claims that the prosecutor committed misconduct by arguing that Yarbrough \u201cwasn\u2019t a savior, he wasn\u2019t an angel\u201d when he protected Vey from being shot by Herring. The prosecutor told the jury that Yarbrough \u201cwas doing what he knew was the smart thing, not to kill Barbara Vey there. They just wanted to get her BMW and get out of Dodge and that\u2019s what they did.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b96-8\">{\u00b6 108} The defense opened the door to such argument. During the defense opening statement, counsel stated that Yarbrough performed \u201cthe sole acts of humanity\u201d in this case when he saved Vey\u2019s life \u201cby putting himself between Boo Herring\u2019s gun and Barbara Vey.\u201d Moreover, the prosecutor\u2019s comments represented fair comment and did not result in plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b96-9\">{\u00b6 109} Second, Yarbrough contends that the prosecutor misbehaved by speculating about Yarbrough\u2019s motive for not killing Porter. The prosecutor argued that Yarbrough did not kill Porter because \u201cit\u2019s broad daylight * * * and this Defendant has what he wants. He\u2019s got a vehicle. He\u2019s got more than $200. He\u2019s got a Chevy Blazer. He doesn\u2019t need anything from Brian Porter other than a ride to the gas station.\u201d As with Vey, the defense opened the door to the state\u2019s argument. During the defense opening statement, counsel indicated that Yarbrough also spared Porter\u2019s life. Again, the prosecutor\u2019s argument was fair comment and did not result in plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"19\">*19</page-number>{\u00b6 110} Third, Yarbrough argues that the prosecutor committed misconduct by arguing that associating with bad people and being a suspicious outsider from Pittsburgh were evidence of guilt. The prosecutor\u2019s argument that \u2018Yarbrough is just this guy from Pittsburgh\u201d focused on rebutting Yarbrough\u2019s statement to police that he was an outsider who just happened to arrive in Steubenville near the time of the murders. The prosecutor\u2019s argument that Yarbrough \u201csought out and chose\u201d Steubenville \u201choodlums and criminals\u201d to be his friends helped make the point that Yarbrough was not just a bystander in these offenses. Thus, the prosecutor\u2019s argument supported the state\u2019s theory of the case and did not constitute plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-5\">{\u00b6 111} Finally, Yarbrough argues that the prosecutor erred in concluding his argument by thanking the jury \u201con behalf of the victims\u2019 families for being as patient and attentive as [it has] been.\u201d Such concluding remarks did not result in plain error. Cf. <em>State v. Goodwin </em>(1999), 84 Ohio St.3d 331, 339, 703 N.E.2d 1251 (\u201cMerely mentioning the personal situation of the victim\u2019s family, without more, does not constitute misconduct\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b97-6\">{\u00b6 112} Cumulative error. Yarbrough also argues that the cumulative effect of prosecutorial misconduct denied him a fair trial. However, our review of the record shows that Yarbrough received a fair trial, and any error was nonprejudicial. Moreover, \u201c[s]uch errors cannot become prejudicial by sheer weight of numbers.\u201d <em>State v. Hill </em>(1996), 75 Ohio St.3d 195, 212, 661 N.E.2d 1068.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-7\">{\u00b6 113} Because none of Yarbrough\u2019s claims establish prosecutorial misconduct, proposition XV is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-8\">\n<em>Ineffective assistance of counsel</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b97-9\">{\u00b6 114} In proposition of law XIX, Yarbrough argues that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. Reversal of convictions on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel requires that the defendant show, first, that counsel\u2019s performance was deficient and, second, that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense so as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial. <em>Strickland v. Washington </em>(1984), 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674. Accord <em>State v. Bradley </em>(1989), 42 Ohio St.3d 136, 538 N.E.2d 373, paragraph two of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b97-10\">{\u00b6 115} First, Yarbrough contends that his defense counsel were ineffective by failing to file a motion to suppress evidence seized from him as the result of his warrantless arrest. Yarbrough argues that his counsel erred by failing to challenge within 48 hours of his being taken into custody whether the police had had probable cause to arrest him. However, the record is unclear as to whether Yarbrough\u2019s defense counsel appeared before a magistrate and filed such a motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"20\">*20</page-number>{\u00b6 116} Nevertheless, any motion to suppress for the lack of probable cause to arrest Yarbrough would have failed. Police properly arrested Yarbrough for driving Muha\u2019s stolen Blazer and then fleeing. Moreover, at the time of Yarbrough\u2019s arrest, there was an outstanding warrant for his arrest on attempted-murder charges in Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-5\">{\u00b6 117} Counsel is not per se ineffective for failing to file a motion to suppress. <em>State v. Madrigal </em>(2000), 87 Ohio St.3d 378, 389, 721 N.E.2d 52, citing <em>Kimmelman v. Morrison </em>(1986), 477 U.S. 365, 384, 106 S.Ct. 2574, 91 L.Ed.2d 305. Moreover, counsel is not deficient for failing to raise a meritless issue. <em>State v. Taylor </em>(1997), 78 Ohio St.3d 15, 31, 676 N.E.2d 82. Thus, Yarbrough has failed to show that his counsel\u2019s performance was deficient. <em>Strickland, </em>466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-6\">{\u00b6 118} Yarbrough raises other instances of alleged ineffectiveness of counsel but none of these prejudiced him. Id. As discussed in other propositions, Yarbrough was not prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s failure to request an instruction on accomplice testimony in relation to Young\u2019s testimony (XII), or by his counsel\u2019s failure to object to prosecutorial misconduct (XV), and he was not prejudiced by his counsel\u2019s failure to object to the presence of alternate jurors in the jury room during deliberations (XVII).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-7\">{\u00b6 119} We also reject Yarbrough\u2019s contention that his counsel was ineffective for not objecting to instructions on reasonable doubt. Our review of the record discloses that his counsel did object.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-8\">{\u00b6 120} Finally, Yarbrough argues that the cumulative effect of his counsel\u2019s ineffective assistance necessitates reversal. Nevertheless, Yarbrough received a fair trial on the noncapital charges. The error presented in Proposition XX is now corrected. See <em>State v. Braden, </em>98 Ohio St.3d 354, 2003-Ohio-1325, 785 N.E.2d 439, \u00b6 123.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-9\">{\u00b6 121} In summary, none of Yarbrough\u2019s claims establish ineffective assistance of counsel. Proposition XIX is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-10\">\n<em>Settled issue</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b98-11\">{\u00b6 122} In proposition of law XXI, Yarbrough disputes the constitutionality of the trial court\u2019s instructions on reasonable doubt in R.C. 2901.05(D). However, we have repeatedly affirmed the constitutionality of R.C. 2901.05(D). See <em>State v. Jones </em>(2001), 91 Ohio St.3d 335, 347, 744 N.E.2d 1163. Proposition XXI is overruled.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-12\">\n<em>Conclusion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b98-13\">{\u00b6 123} We find that under R.C. 2901.11, the trial court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over the aggravated-murder charges on which Yarbrough was tried <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"21\">*21</page-number>and convicted. Accordingly, we dismiss Counts 6, through 11 and Counts 13 through 17 and vacate the defendant\u2019s sentence of death. Further, we dismiss the charge of receiving stolen property in Count 19 because charges for receiving stolen property and theft of the Chevrolet Blazer are allied offenses of similar import. We affirm the jury\u2019s verdict and the trial court\u2019s sentence on the remaining counts.</p>\n<attorneys id=\"AQv\">Christopher Becker, Jefferson County Assistant Prosecuting Attorney, for appellee.</attorneys>\n<attorneys id=\"AsE\">David H.
