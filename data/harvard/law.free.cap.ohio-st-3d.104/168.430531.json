VII(5). The complaint alleged that respondents Comp-Management, Inc. (\u201cCMI\u201d), Jonathan R. Wagner, Robert J. Bossart, and Bobbijo Christensen engaged in the unauthorized practice of law as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b247-10\">{\u00b6 2} (1) \u201c[B]y appearing in person at formal, oral, adjudicatory hearings, scheduled and held by the Industrial Commission of Ohio, upon various disputed workers\u2019 compensation matters, in behalf of so-called \u2018clients\u2019 of respondent CompManagement, Inc., and, in the course of such appearances, performing such acts as examining and/or cross-examining witnesses; interpreting statutory provisions, case law, and administrative rulings; and making and/or giving legal interpretations with respect to the nature, weight, significance, and credibility of the evidence presented at such hearings and/or theretofore already of record in the Industrial Commission of Ohio\u2019s claim file upon the claim then in issue\u201d; and</p>\n<p id=\"b247-11\">{\u00b6 3} (2) By preparing, signing, and filing \u201cvarious documents of a legal nature, such as notices of appeal, motions, objections to orders of the Administrator of Workers\u2019 Compensation, applications for handicap reimbursement, applications for the settlement of individual workers\u2019 compensation claims, and requests for continuances, in behalf of respondent CompManagement, Inc.\u2019s so-called \u2018clients.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b248-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>{\u00b64} After extensive discovery by the parties, the board held a formal evidentiary hearing pursuant to Gov.Bar R. VII(7)(A) and (14), which was conducted on May 21 and 22, 2003, and adjourned to and completed on August 22, 2003. The board filed its final report on May 18, 2004, recommending that this court issue an order finding that respondents CMI and Bobbijo Christensen have engaged in the unauthorized practice of law, prohibiting them from engaging in the unauthorized practice of law in the future, and providing for reimbursement of costs and expenses incurred by the board and relator.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-5\">{\u00b6 5} In making its recommendation, the board concluded that the following conduct in which CMI and/or Christensen engaged amounts to the unauthorized practice of law: (1) \u201cpreparation, signing and filing of documents in handling claims before the Industrial Commission on behalf of employers,\u201d (2) \u201cnegotiation and involvement with settling claims,\u201d (3) \u201cdirect and indirect examination [including cross-examination] of witnesses during hearings,\u201d (4) \u201cpresentation of employer concerns, arguments, summations of evidence, conclusions regarding the import of factual information and/or closing statements on behalf of employers during hearings,\u201d (5) \u201crecommendation and advice to employers as to taking appeals and other legal action,\u201d and (6) \u201cevaluation, advice or recommendation concerning whether an employer should retain an attorney to handle a claim before the Industrial Commission.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-6\">{\u00b6 6} The board also found that CMI engaged in the unauthorized practice of law generally by its \u201crepresentation of employers\u2019 interests in handling claims before the Industrial Commission,\u201d and that it furnished information to its hearing representatives with regard to \u201c[p]ertinent court decisions and changes in the workers\u2019 compensation law * * *, sometimes using a law firm to summarize the legal developments for [its] employees.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">{\u00b6 7} Despite the breadth of its evidentiary review, the board\u2019s legal analysis was admittedly less than comprehensive. The board found itself unequipped \u201cto evaluate * * * public interest factors or exercise discretion in applying Rule VII,\u201d since it serves only \u201cas an advisory body under the Supreme Court and * * * merely offers recommendations.\u201d Accordingly, the board declined to consider that the public interest might warrant restraint in the use of the court\u2019s power to suppress lay representation in the workers\u2019 compensation field. Instead, the board took the approach that respondents are not authorized to engage in any conduct that corresponds to an activity that has been listed in some generalized definition of the practice of law under \u201cthe applicable precedents,\u201d while leaving it to this court to \u201cfactor[ ] in public interest considerations and a measure of flexibility\u201d in determining whether \u201clay representation [would] pose a hazard to the public in this limited setting.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"171\">*171</page-number>{\u00b6 8} After the filing of the final report of the board, we issued an order to respondents to show cause why the report should not be confirmed and an appropriate order granted. Gov.Bar R. VII(19)(A). Both respondents and relator have filed objections to the report.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">{\u00b6 9} The cause is now before the court for the determination specified in Gov.Bar R. VII(19)(D).</p>\n<p id=\"b249-6\">{\u00b6 10} The immediate issue in this unauthorized-practice-of-law case centers on the activities of a single, although perhaps Ohio\u2019s largest, actuarial service company and its employees in connection with their representation of employers in matters of workers\u2019 compensation. The potential impact of its resolution, however, extends far beyond this proceeding, for it implicates the Industrial Commission\u2019s longstanding policy of permitting nonlawyers, specifically actuarial firms and unions, to appear and practice before the commission and the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation in a representative capacity on behalf of employers and injured workers and to perform a variety of functions as regards the administration and adjudication of workers\u2019 compensation claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-7\">{\u00b6 11} The workers\u2019 compensation system in Ohio began with \u201cthe unanimous adoption of Proposal Number 24, or Section 35, Article II [of the Ohio Constitution], at the Constitutional Convention of 1912 and the enactment of Ohio\u2019s first compulsory workers\u2019 compensation law, 103 Ohio Laws 72, on February 26,1913.\u201d <em>Holeton v. Crouse Cartage Co. </em>(2001), 92 Ohio St.3d 115, 118, 748 N.E.2d 1111. The system was conceived and has long since functioned as an alternative loss-distribution mechanism to that of the common law of torts, which had proved wholly unsound and \u201cincapable of dealing with the often devastating social and economic consequences of industrial accidents.\u201d Id. at 119, 748 N.E.2d 1111.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-8\">{\u00b6 12} The joint committee that sponsored the 1924 constitutional amendment that put Section 35, Article II in its present form intended for the system to operate \u201c \u2018without necessity for recourse to law suits or employment of attorneys or payment of court costs.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mabley &amp; Carew Co. v. Lee </em>(1934), 129 Ohio St. 69, 74-75, 1 O.O. 366, 193 N.E. 745. Thus, \u201c[o]ne of the main objects sought to be accomplished by [the] enactment [of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act] was to provide a speedy, simple, and inexpensive method to compensate\u201d workers for work-related injuries \u201cand to do away with the vexatious and protracted litigation which had proved so costly, exhaustive, and unsatisfactory, oftimes resulting in great injustice.\u201d <em>Goodman v. Beall </em>(1936), 130 Ohio St. 427, 429, 5 O.O. 52, 200 N.E. 470.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">{\u00b6 13} Accordingly, lay representation has been a feature of Ohio\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation system since its inception. Id. at 430, 5 O.O. 52, 200 N.E. 470. While the adjective complexities of today\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation statutes \u201cbear[ ] little resemblance to the rather simple plan first prescribed,\u201d <em>McMillen </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"172\">*172</page-number><em>v. McCahan </em>(C.P.1960), 83 Ohio Law Abs. 1, 14 O.O.2d 221, 167 N.E.2d 541, 549, the sophistication and presence of nonlawyer representatives in the system have steadily increased. Thus, in 1963, it was estimated that 20,000 claims were set for an initial-level hearing before the Industrial Commission each year, that a representative appears on behalf of at least one of the parties in 60-65 percent of the hearings, and that \u201cnonlawyers represent claimants in 60 per cent of the cases and employers in more than 50 per cent of the cases\u201d in which a hearing representative is involved. <em>In re Unauthorized Practice of Law in Cuyahoga Cty. </em>(1963), 175 Ohio St. 149, 156-157, 23 O.O.2d 445, 192 N.E.2d 54 (Gibson, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-5\">{\u00b6 14} By 1970, actuarial firms in particular had become the primary means by which many Ohio employers discharge their obligations under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. Consequently, on December 31, 1970, the Unauthorized Practice of Law Committee of the Ohio State Bar Association (\u201cOSBA\u201d) and 13 actuarial service companies adopted a set of \u201cStandards of Practice Governing Actuarial Services,\u201d which is often tersely referred to as the \u201c1970 agreement.\u201d See XLIV Ohio Bar 161 (Feb. 8, 1971). Cf. <em>State ex rel. Nicodemus v. Indus. Comm. </em>(1983), 5 Ohio St.3d 58, 62-63, 5 OBR 115, 448 N.E.2d 1360 (Holmes, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">{\u00b6 15} The 1970 agreement enumerates various functions that actuarial firms may and may not properly perform and recommends \u201cto others concerned\u201d that they follow these \u201cprinciples as standards of proper conduct for actuarial service companies.\u201d XLIY Ohio Bar at 162. In so doing, the agreement purports to strike an appropriate balance between \u201cthe public interest [in] the prompt, fair and efficient administration of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Laws\u201d and the \u201crecognition that no person may practice law in Ohio, who has not been admitted to the Bar by the Supreme Court of Ohio.\u201d Id. at 162,163.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">{\u00b6 16} By its own terms, the 1970 agreement is not directly enforceable against anyone. Id. at 164. (Determinations of joint actuarial service commission created under agreement \u201cshall not be binding upon any signatory to these standards.\u201d) Its list of permissible and prohibited actuarial functions, however, has since been the cornerstone of the Industrial Commission\u2019s policy on nonlawyer appearance and practice before the agency. As explained in a recent \u201cStatement of All Members of the Industrial Commission,\u201d dated May 21, 2004, \u201cFor more than 30 years, this and past Industrial Commissions have followed the 1970 Agreement * * *. Relevant portions of the agreement were set forth initially in Hearing Officer Manual at T.6. This policy statement has been in place since January 1, 1989 and was republished in 2001 as Hearing Officer Manual R4.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ABj\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"173\">*173</page-number>{\u00b6 17} In their May 21, 2004 statement, the commissioners also revealed that \u201c[i]n the past two days, approximately 70% of Industrial Commission hearings have been continued due to concerns raised following [the board\u2019s] recommendations [in this case]\u201d and that \u201cinjured workers and their employers have experienced hardships due to the continuation of hearings.\u201d Accordingly, the Industrial Commission rescinded Hearing Officer Manual Memo R4 on June 2, 2004, and replaced it with Resolution No. R04-1-01. Some of the stated purposes of the resolution are to update the standards set forth in the 1970 agreement in order to reflect \u201cchanges in the workers\u2019 compensation system that have developed over the last 33 years,\u201d to resolve questions concerning \u201cthose specific guidelines that are in the 1970 agreement * * * but are not expressly set forth in Memo R4,\u201d and \u201cto issue interim standards for third party administrators [i.e., actuarial firms], union representatives, or employees of employers who appear before the Bureau and Commission until permanent guidelines are issued by the Ohio Supreme Court in the case of <em>Cleveland Bar Association v. CompManagement, </em>Case No. 04-0817.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b251-4\">{\u00b6 18} Industrial Commission Resolution No. R04-1-01 provides:</p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">{\u00b6 19} \u201c(A) The following activities shall be permitted before the Industrial Commission or the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation, to the extent performed by third-party administrators, by union representatives until permanent guidelines are provided by the Ohio Supreme Court, or employees of an employer:</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">{\u00b6 20} \u201c1.

Provide stand-alone representation at hearing by charging a fee specifically associated with such hearing representation without providing other services.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b253-5\">{\u00b6 37} Nonlawyer representatives are today more than ever an integral part of Ohio\u2019s workers\u2019 compensation system. As of June 2002, there were 2,224,466 open workers\u2019 compensation claims in Ohio. Between 1997 and 2002, the Industrial Commission held an average of 179,786 hearings each year. During 2002, a total of 236,344 new claims were filed, and 189,869 claims were heard. According to the bureau, \u201c[a]s of March 30, 2003, there were 12,546 active claims with a representative having a code of \u2018LREP UNION IW\u2019 which is usually used for a union representative.\u201d According to CMI\u2019s expert, Daniel Ingberman, \u201c[o]f the 263,638 workers\u2019 compensation insurance policies in Ohio in 2002, 99,224 (37.6%) use the services of an Actuarial Firm for their workers\u2019 compensation claims.\u201d Employers using the services of CMI in claims with injury dates between January 1998 and December 2001 sought attorney representation at hearings only \u201c1.5% of the time.\u201d The state of Ohio estimates that nonlawyers represent at least one party in approximately 95 percent of the hearings held each year and that \u201cin almost half of all Industrial Commission hearings (47 percent or 89,300 total hearings) [held each year], the employer\u2019s only representative is an actuary.\u201d And considering that within two days after the board\u2019s report in this case the Industrial Commission was compelled to continue \u201capproximately 70%\u201d of its hearings due to concerns over nonlawyer representation, it is clear that actuarial firms and unions have come to play a critical role in the workers\u2019 compensation system.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">{\u00b6 38} It is no secret that a full confirmation of the board\u2019s report in this case would substantially alter the administrative landscape. As the 90 parties and amici interested in this proceeding are well aware, that eventuality would immediately vitiate Industrial Commission procedures that have been in place for more than 30 years, ban virtually all nonlawyer involvement in the hearing process, significantly, if not drastically, curtail the business of actuarial firms, and, to a lesser extent, impair the ability of unions to represent their members, and increase the premium costs and attorney fees for workers\u2019 compensation claims in Ohio. From a practical standpoint, the issuance of an order as recommended by the board would purge the workers\u2019 compensation system of nonlawyer representatives, for the board has suggested that we enjoin laypersons from engaging in conduct that ranges from the most mundane processing functions, such as preparing administrative documents, to the overall handling of workers\u2019 compensation claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">{\u00b6 39} This court has exclusive power to regulate, control, and define the practice of law in Ohio and, therefore, the ultimate \u201cauthority to determine the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>qualifications of persons engaged in the practice of law before the Industrial Commission.\u201d <em>In re Unauthorized, Practice of Law in Cuyahoga Cty., </em>supra, 175 Ohio St. at 151, 23 O.O.2d 445, 192 N.E.2d 54. See, also, <em>Shimko v. Lobe, </em>103 Ohio St.3d 59, 2004-Ohio-4202, 813 N.E.2d 669, \u00b6 15. However, while this court unquestionably has the power to prohibit lay representation before an administrative agency, it is not always necessary or desirable for the court to exercise that power to its full extent. The power to regulate includes the authority to grant as well as the authority to deny, and in certain limited settings, the public interest is better served by authorizing laypersons to engage in conduct that might be viewed as the practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">{\u00b6 40} Because the \u201cpublic interest factors\u201d that the board declined to consider are so prevalent in this case, a more sophisticated approach to resolving the present inquiry is required than simply ascertaining whether respondents\u2019 conduct falls within some abstract or generalized definition of the practice of law. Of course, Gov.Bar R. VII is built on the premise that limiting the practice of law to licensed attorneys is generally necessary to protect the public against incompetence, divided loyalties, and other attendant evils that are often associated with unskilled representation. But not all representation requires the level of training and experience that only attorneys can provide, and in certain situations, the protective interest is outweighed by other important considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">{\u00b6 41} Thus, in a keenly insightful analysis, former Justice Gibson provided the following essential framework for resolving the present inquiry:</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">{\u00b6 42} \u201c[W]hat part, if any, of the activities required of one acting in a representative capacity before the Industrial Commission or the Bureau of Workmen\u2019s Compensation or both constitute^] the practice of law for which only attorneys at law are qualified? The answer to this question involves the resolution of many conflicting interests and considerations.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">{\u00b6 43} \u201cIn an attempt to find a mold in which to fit this issue, many cases concerning the unauthorized practice of law by those not licensed as attorneys at law were examined. Such cases, including those relating specifically to workmen\u2019s compensation, are filled frequently with broad and sometimes all-encompassing statements, which might be termed political in nature, as to what constitutes the practice of law, but in the end the courts find that not all is black or white, and laymen usually are permitted to continue performing some acts alleged to constitute the unauthorized practice of law. Clearly, the answer to the critical question in this case is not to be found in any generalized definition of what constitutes the practice of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-9\">{\u00b6 44} \u201cThere can be no doubt that here it is necessary to balance (1) the public interest in the greater protection generally afforded the public in matters relating to the law by persons who have pursued required courses of legal training, passed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>examinations showing their qualifications in legal matters and who are subject to ethical standards enforced by this court against (2) the public interest, as expressed in constitutional and statutory provisions, in affording workers compensation for injuries or death arising out of and in the course of employment without necessity of litigation, attorneys, and their attendant costs. (Attention is invited to <em>Goodman v. Beall et al., Industrial Commission </em>[1936], 130 Ohio St. 427 [5 O.O. 52, 200 N.E. 470], where Zimmerman, J., for this court, discussed the objectives of both Section 35, Article II, Ohio Constitution, and the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act.) These conflicting interests are represented by the committee, which emphasizes the necessity of protecting the public against the hazards of advice and representation of persons unqualified in the law with respect to rights and obligations under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act, as amended and as construed by numerous court rulings and by the respondents, who emphasize the informality of workmen\u2019s compensation proceedings and the desire of the founders of the Ohio workmen\u2019s compensation system to enable workers to obtain relief without paying attorney fees or court costs and without vexing litigation.\u201d <em>In re Unauthorized Practice of Law in Cuyahoga Cty., </em>supra, 175 Ohio St. at 154-155, 23 O.O.2d 445, 192 N.E.2d 54 (Gibson, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p id=\"b255-4\">{\u00b6 45} Confronting a similar issue in <em>Henize v. Giles </em>(1986), 22 Ohio St.3d 213, 22 OBR 364, 490 N.E.2d 585, the court decided to authorize lay representation at unemployment compensation hearings even though that activity could be viewed as the practice of law. At issue in <em>Henize </em>was an agency rule that authorized nonlawyers to represent claimants and employers at administrative hearings before the Ohio Bureau of Employment Services and the Unemployment Compensation Board of Review. As explained by the court:</p>\n<p id=\"b255-5\">{\u00b6 46} \u201cThis rule reflects the board\u2019s longstanding policy of permitting non-lawyers to assist parties in the presentation of their claims. The proceedings are designed and function as alternatives to judicial dispute resolution so that the services of a lawyer are not a requisite to receiving a fair hearing and just decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-6\">{\u00b6 47} \u201cIn this regard, claimants are traditionally accompanied by * * * union representatives * * *. Over the years, an increasing number of employers have utilized [actuarial] service companies to provide management support of various payroll, tax and employee benefit operations. * * * As an incidental portion of such service, agents are provided to attend board hearings as representatives of the employer.\u201d Id., 22 Ohio St.3d at 216-217, 22 OBR 364, 490 N.E.2d 585.</p>\n<p id=\"b255-7\">{\u00b6 48} The court recognized that along with its broad regulatory power over the practice of law comes \u201cthe concomitant responsibility to protect the public by preventing the unauthorized practice of law, while at the same time not exercising <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>this authority so rigidly that the public good suffers.\u201d Id. at 217, 22 OBR 364, 490 N.E.2d 585. The court explained that it is \u201cthe responsibility of the judiciary not to take a one-dimensional approach in the area of regulating the unauthorized practice of law,\u201d but instead to exercise its power \u201c \u2018in a common-sense way in order to protect primarily the interest of the public and not to hamper and burden such interest with impractical technical restraints.\u2019 \u201d Id. at 218, 22 OBR 364, 490 N.E.2d 585, quoting <em>Cowern v. Nelson </em>(1940), 207 Minn. 642, 647, 290 N.W. 795.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-5\">{\u00b6 49} Thus, after noting that \u201cother states have allowed lay representation at unemployment hearings even though it could arguably be viewed as the practice of law,\u201d the court further explained:</p>\n<p id=\"b256-6\">{\u00b6 50} \u201cThe following quote from <em>State v. Dinger </em>(1961), 14 Wis.2d 193, 109 N.W.2d 685 (which allowed brokers to engage in certain legal practices), is representative of the reasoning of some of our sister states which have allowed lay practice in certain instances and is instructive to the case sub judice:</p>\n<p id=\"b256-7\">{\u00b6 51} \u201c \u2018Further, although we have the power to declare void Rule, sec. R.E.B. 5.04, insofar as it affects the practice of law, we do not use the power in this instance, because we, ourselves, consider the rule a salutary one which in its essentials continues a practice of laymen which we have long tacitly permitted and which has worked reasonably well. The Rule has not enlarged the practice of the law by laymen which we have hitherto permitted. When we consider that such practices should be discontinued it will be time for us to use our power. It is not required now.\u2019 Id. at 206,109 N.W.2d at 692.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-8\">{\u00b6 52} \u201cThe finding is inescapable that because of the character of the proceedings in light of the interest at stake, lay representation does not pose a hazard to the public in this limited setting. Our conclusion is further bolstered by the clear recognition that lay representation has been the practice since the inception of Ohio\u2019s unemployment compensation program in 1936.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-9\">{\u00b6 53} \u201c* * * We believe board hearings should not be turned into adversarial proceedings since they are legislatively designed to function as an informal mechanism through which the referee, in a participatory capacity, ascertains the facts involved. In light of the serious detriment to claimants and employers which would result if the current system was unnecessarily disturbed, we deem this to be an appropriate and <em>limited setting </em>in which to authorize lay representation by granting due deference to the statute and agency rule.\u201d (Emphasis sic; footnote omitted.) Id. at 218-220, 22 OBR 364, 490 N.E.2d 585.</p>\n<p id=\"b256-10\">{\u00b6 54} Nevertheless, lay representatives were not given carte blanche in <em>Henize </em>to appear and practice before the unemployment compensation agencies. Accordingly, the court in <em>Henize </em>was careful to point out: \u201cOur decision today does not reach nor permit the rendering of legal advice regarding unemployment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>compensation laws or board orders. Rather, our narrow holding merely permits lay representation of parties to assist in the preparation and presentation of their cause in order to facilitate the hearing process.\u201d Id., 22 Ohio St.3d at 219, 22 OBR 364, 490 N.E.2d 585. Specifically, the court permitted agents of actuarial firms to attend board hearings as employer representatives in order \u201cto assure that the board has the appropriate personnel records, staff, and other documents present at the hearing and to assist in the fact-finding process during the referee\u2019s claim review.\u201d Id. at 217, 22 OBR 364, 490 N.E.2d 585.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-4\">{\u00b6 55} In the workers\u2019 compensation setting, the court has decided four cases involving lay practices before the Industrial Commission in which it held that certain specific legal activities are properly performed only by attorneys at law. <em>Cincinnati Bar Assn. v. Estep </em>(1995), 74 Ohio St.3d 172, 657 N.E.2d 499 (contingent-fee representation of workers\u2019 compensation claimant); <em>In re Unauthorized Practice of Law, </em>supra (same); <em>State ex rel. Nicodemus, </em>supra (advising clients of the legal ramifications of commission orders); <em>Goodman, </em>supra (preparation of court record under pre-1955 rehearing proceedings in accordance with former G.C. 1465-90, 111 Ohio Laws 227). Because the activities at issue in these cases were so clearly beyond any acceptable bounds of lay representation, the court was able in certain instances to simply make a general statement about the legal nature of appearances and practice before the Industrial Commission and conclude therefrom that the lay conduct at issue was unauthorized. This approach, however, has tended to create substantial confusion over the legal nature of other lay practices before the commission and the extent to which the practice-of-law label determines the layperson\u2019s authority to engage in representative conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b257-5\">{\u00b6 56} Indeed, this court added to the confusion by actually misreading its own cases in <em>Henize. </em>Thus, despite the obvious fact that the unemployment and workers\u2019 compensation settings are virtually equivalent in every way that matters for purposes of the present discussion, the court in <em>Henize </em>felt compelled to draw a tenuous distinction between the two fields because it mistakenly concluded that our past decisions in the workers\u2019 compensation area \u201chave held that representatives of parties must be licensed attorneys.\u201d Id., 22 Ohio St.3d at 219, 22 OBR 364, 490 N.E.2d 585, fn. 10. To the same effect, CBA has cited those decisions to support its contention that nonlawyers are precluded from performing the various representative functions mentioned in the board\u2019s report that are allowed under Resolution No. R04-1-01. But the plain truth is that this court has never held that only lawyers may practice in a representative capacity before the Industrial Commission. Nor has the court ever concluded that nonlawyers are unauthorized to provide the kind of representative services in the workers\u2019 compensation setting that the court in <em>Henize </em>authorized them to provide in the unemployment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>context. Accordingly, we find that now is the appropriate time to clarify the import of our prior decisions in this area.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-5\">{\u00b6 57} In <em>In re Unauthorized Practice of Law, </em>the court upheld an injunction prohibiting certain individuals and a partnership from representing workers\u2019 compensation claimants. In so doing, the court held:</p>\n<p id=\"b258-6\">{\u00b6 58} \u201cNo person, other than an attorney in good standing, may hold himself out as being qualified to render service to those who may have claims for compensation arising under the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Laws of Ohio or as being able to render services in the preparation and presentation of such claims nor may such person render such advice or services if a fee for such advice or services is to be received from or charged against the one having such a claim.\u201d Id., 175 Ohio St. 149, 23 O.OI.2d 445, 192 N.E.2d 54, paragraph three of the syllabus.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-7\">{\u00b6 59} The awkward syntax of this syllabus makes it facially unclear whether the court was prohibiting lay representatives from providing preparation and presentation services in general or merely for a fee. Thus, CBA argues that under this holding, laypersons are generally precluded from \u201c[ajppearing at adjudicative hearings as advocates before the Industrial Commission.\u201d We find it eminently clear, however, that the court did not intend its holding to apply beyond the particular type of conduct at issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-8\">{\u00b6 60} In reaching its holding, the court specifically recognized that there is \u201ca substantial danger that reasons given by this court for its decision in this case may be interpreted as prejudging controversies which may later arise in determining whether other kinds of conduct not in or related to court cases amount to the practice of law. Thus, the briefs filed in this case on behalf of <em>amici curiae </em>emphasize how important it is that this court should avoid broad generalizations in giving its reasons for holding that what the respondents did in the instant case amounted to the practice of law.\u201d Id., 175 Ohio St. at 152, 23 O.O.2d 445, 192 N.E.2d 54.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-9\">{\u00b6 61} An expansive interpretation of the holding in <em>In re Unauthorized Practice of Law </em>would, therefore, be patently illogical, for it necessarily assumes that the court made the very kind of broad generalization that it expressly sought to avoid. In any event, the court specifically explained that its primary concern was in \u201c[pjrotecting members of the public from being induced <em>to pay </em>for such advice and services of nonlawyers\u201d and that \u201cthe judgment of the trial court enjoins respondents from doing those acts instead of, as it probably should have, merely enjoining them from doing them <em>for a fee.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) Id. at 152-153, 23 O.O.2d 445, 192 N.E.2d 54, citing <em>Goodman, </em>supra.</p>\n<p id=\"b258-10\">{\u00b6 62} In <em>Estep, </em>supra, the court prohibited the respondent in that case from engaging in essentially the same conduct that was enjoined in <em>In re Unauthorized </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"181\">*181</page-number><em>Practice of Law, </em>and its primary focus was also on prohibiting nonlawyers from charging or receiving a fee for rendering advice or services to workers\u2019 compensation claimants. Nevertheless, CBA cites <em>Estep </em>for the proposition that \u201c[p]re-paring, signing, and filing of legal papers \u2014 such as objections to orders, notices of appeal, motions, protests and applications \u2014 with the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation and the Industrial Commission in behalf of others constitutes the practice of law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b259-4\">{\u00b6 63} In a general sense, CBA is correct, for the court in <em>Estep </em>found that \u201cappearances and practice before the Industrial Commission constitute the practice of law.\u201d Id., 74 Ohio St.3d at 173, 657 N.E.2d 499. In so doing, the court cited <em>State ex rel. Nicodemus, </em>supra, 5 Ohio St.3d at 60, 5 OBR 115, 448 N.E.2d 1360, which held as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b259-5\">{\u00b6 64} \u201cAppearances and practice before the Industrial Commission constitute the practice of law. <em>Goodman </em>* * *; <em>In re Unauthorized Practice of Law </em>[supra]. Gates, McDonald [an actuarial firm] is not authorized to practice law, and, thus, is not authorized to advise its clients of the legal ramifications of commission orders. For this reason, we find that the \u2018import\u2019 of the order was beyond the scope of Gates, McDonald\u2019s authority, and that the notice received by it cannot be imputed to the employer.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b259-6\">{\u00b6 65} But aside from the specific conduct at issue in these cases, the court has held that laypersons are <em>not </em>prohibited from appearing and practicing before the commission in a representative capacity. All three of these <em>cases </em>\u2014 Estep, <em>State ex rel. Nicodemus, </em>and <em>In re Unauthorized Practice of Law </em>\u2014ultimately come to rest on the court\u2019s decision in <em>Goodman. </em>Yet <em>Goodman </em>never held that appearances and practice before the Industrial Commission generally constitute the practice of law for which only attorneys are qualified. <em>Goodman </em>held only that \u201cthe preparation of a rehearing record should be in complete charge of an attorney at law\u201d because \u201c[s]uch record constitutes the entire evidence upon which the merits or demerits of a claim can be determined by a court and jury.\u201d Id., 130 Ohio St. at 433, 5 O.O. 52, 200 N.E. 470.</p>\n<p id=\"b259-7\">{\u00b6 66} Other than the preparation of a court record, however, the court in <em>Goodman </em>specifically held that lay representatives <em>are generally authorized </em>to appear and practice before the Industrial Commission. Thus, the court explained:</p>\n<p id=\"b259-8\">{\u00b6 67} \u201cIn the vast majority of instances no special skill is required in the preparation and presentation of claims. Ordinarily they consist of statements and affidavits submitted by the employer, the employee, or the latter\u2019s dependents, and by others having knowledge of the facts, accompanied by the reports of attending physicians or surgeons, on forms prepared and furnished by the commission. Frequently the commission has its own representative conduct an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>independent investigation of the particular claim for the purpose of ascertaining the true situation, and sometimes there are informal oral hearings before a referee. Validity of the claim having been established, compensation is paid on the basis prescribed by the statutes, and the incident is closed.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-4\">{\u00b6 68} \u201cSince the inception of the Workmen\u2019s Compensation Act it has been common practice for laymen to assist an injured or diseased workman or his dependents in the submission of a claim. Often this is done as an accommodation by representatives of the employer or by representatives of an organization to which a claimant may belong, and such usually simple services are for the most part performed in an expeditious and satisfactory manner. In our judgment this is not the practice of law * * Id., 130 Ohio St. at 430-431, 5 O.O. 52, 200 N.E. 470.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-5\">{\u00b6 69} It now becomes readily apparent that these four cases do not prohibit lay representation before the Industrial Commission, but instead mark the outer boundaries of permissible lay conduct. It is also clear that the thicket created by our ambivalent use of the term \u201cpractice of law\u201d can be avoided by simply recognizing that in certain cases there are multiple interests to consider in determining whether a particular legal activity is acceptably performed by nonlawyers. In this way, we can freely assume that all representative conduct at the administrative level falls within the broad definition of the practice of law, yet still authorize lay representatives to perform certain functions in the administrative setting when the public interest so demands.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-6\">{\u00b6 70} Because of the undeniable similarities in the unemployment compensation and workers\u2019 compensation settings, and considering that mandating the use of attorneys at the administrative level would frustrate the goals and designs of the workers\u2019 compensation system, we hold that nonlawyers who appear and practice in a representative capacity before the Industrial Commission and the Bureau of Workers\u2019 Compensation in conformity to Industrial Commission Resolution No. R04-1-01 are not engaged in the unauthorized practice of law.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b260-7\">{\u00b6 71} Accordingly, the board\u2019s recommendation is hereby rejected, and the cause is remanded to the board with instructions to consider any allegations by relator that the respondents failed to act in accordance with standards now set forth in Resolution No. R04-1-01.</p>\n<p id=\"b260-8\">Judgment accordingly.</p>\n<judges id=\"b260-9\">Moyer, C.J., Lundberg Stratton and O\u2019Connor, JJ., concur.</judges>\n<judges id=\"ADF\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"183\">*183</page-number>O\u2019Donnell, J., concurs in judgment only.</judges>\n<judges id=\"b261-4\">F.E.

In its complaint, CBA also alleged that attorney Tim Toth had assisted the respondents in engaging in the unauthorized practice of law. Although attorney Toth was initially named as a respondent in these proceedings, the board has dismissed the claims against him for lack of jurisdiction, and no objections have been filed to this aspect of the board\u2019s report.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b260-10\">. In light of this holding, we find relator\u2019s objections to the board\u2019s findings that respondents Wagner and Bossart did not engage in the unauthorized practice of law to be moot.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"6\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b261-6\">Pfeifer, J.,</author>\n<p id=\"AXA\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-7\">{\u00b6 72} The Board of Commissioners on the Unauthorized Practice of Law concluded that CompManagement\u2019s \u201crepresentation of employers\u2019 interests in handling claims before the Industrial Commission on behalf of employers amounts to the unauthorized practice of law.\u201d The board concluded that Comp-Management\u2019s \u201cnegotiation and involvement with settling claims before the Industrial Commission on behalf of employers amounts to the unauthorized practice of law.\u201d The board concluded that CompManagement\u2019s \u201cdirect and indirect examination of witnesses during hearings before the Industrial Commission amounts to the unauthorized practice of law.\u201d The board concluded that CompManagement\u2019s \u201cpresentation of employer concerns, arguments, summations of evidence, conclusions regarding the import of factual information and/or closing statements on behalf of employers during hearings before the Industrial Commission amounts to the unauthorized practice of law.\u201d The board concluded that CompManagement\u2019s \u201crecommendation and advice to employers as to taking appeals or other legal action in handling claims before the Industrial Commission on behalf of employers amounts to the authorized practice of law.\u201d Finally, the board concluded that CompManagement\u2019s \u201cevaluation, advice or recommendation concerning whether an employer should retain an attorney to handle a claim before the Industrial Commission amounts to the unauthorized practice of law.\u201d Based on the facts presented, I agree with each of these conclusions.</p>\n<p id=\"b261-8\">{\u00b6 73} I believe that the practice of law is the practice of law and that nonlawyers should not be authorized to engage in it. I believe this notwithstanding tradition and putative cost-savings. Finding that CompManagement and similar entities engaged in the unauthorized practice of law and prohibiting them from so engaging in the future would not lead to calamitous results. CompManagement could still play a meaningful role in a host of administrative activities. The market is overflowing with young, enterprising attorneys willing to perform this work. The surfeit of attorneys would help keep costs about where they are now. In any event, I do not find cost-savings to be a relevant issue. CompManagement engaged in the unauthorized practice of law and ought to be punished accordingly.
