Hudson Connery, Jr., appeals from the judgment of the trial court, which granted the motion of the named defendant, Elizabeth May Gieske, executrix of the estate of the decedent, Ann May Moore,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   to dismiss the plaintiff's action. The defendant sought dismissal on the ground that the Probate Court lacked jurisdiction over the parties' dispute because it was barred by the applicable statute of limitations. See General Statutes \u00a7 45a-186 (a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff, who had been married to the decedent, claims that the trial court improperly treated the present action as an\n   appeal from orders of the Probate Court when, in fact, it is an action to vindicate the plaintiff's right to remove probate matters to the Superior Court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 45a-98a.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff further maintains that, even if\n   the trial court correctly determined that the present action is an appeal, it incorrectly determined\n   that it was untimely under \u00a7 45a-186 (a). We conclude that the trial court correctly determined that the present action is an appeal. We further conclude, however, that the trial court incorrectly determined that it was barred by the statute of limitations. The record reveals, rather, that the appeal was filed prematurely. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the trial court, albeit on a different ground.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of the plaintiff's claims. Following the decedent's death on December 14, 2011, the defendant was named as the executrix of her estate. An application to admit the decedent's will to probate was filed on January 5, 2012. At that time, the plaintiff filed a written waiver of his right to receive notice of the hearing, stating that he had examined the will and had no objection to it. On June 4, 2012, however, the plaintiff filed a notice of claim in which he contested the legality and validity of the will, asserting that the decedent \"died intestate ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The plaintiff further claimed, \"in the alternative, [that] in the event it is determined that [the decedent] did not die intestate,\" he intended to elect his spousal share under the will pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 45a-436.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On or about October 22, 2012, the plaintiff filed a second notice of claim in which he sought reimbursement of \"monies advanced to [the decedent] prior to [their] marriage, in the amount of not less than [$275,000].\" The defendant rejected the second claim as untimely, and the plaintiff filed a timely application for a hearing on the rejected claim pursuant to General Statutes (Rev. to 2011) \u00a7 45a-364 (a). Thereafter, on or\n   about November 1, 2012, the defendant filed motions to require the plaintiff to surrender certain property belonging to the estate and to disclose information pertaining to the plaintiff's and the decedent's joint assets. On or about February 6, 2013, the plaintiff filed a motion to compel the defendant to disclose information about estate assets. On or about February 26, 2013, the defendant filed a notice of deposition of the plaintiff, in response to which the plaintiff sought a protective order from the Probate Court. On or about February 27, 2013, the beneficiaries under the decedent's will, namely, Fletcher Williams Moore, John Parker Moore and Gwendolyn Calla Moore Gelb, filed an objection to the plaintiff's June 4, 2012 notice of claim challenging the legality and validity of the will and giving notice of his intention to claim a\n   spousal share in the event that his challenge to the will is unsuccessful. The beneficiaries contended that the plaintiff had waived his right to the spousal share by challenging the legality and validity of the will. A Probate Court hearing on all of these matters was scheduled for March 6, 2013.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Prior to that hearing, however, the plaintiff filed an affidavit pursuant to \u00a7 45a-98a (a), in which he indicated his intention to remove the case to the Superior Court for a jury trial. The defendant objected to the affidavit, arguing that none of the matters before the Probate Court was eligible for removal because none involved a dispute over title to or the right to possession of estate property. At the March 6, 2013 hearing, the Probate Court examined each of the disputed matters to determine whether they were eligible for removal. The Probate Court concluded that only the defendant's motions to require the plaintiff to surrender personal property and to disclose information about joint assets were eligible for removal because they involved a dispute over title to or possession of estate property. As for the remaining matters, the Probate Court determined\n   that they were not eligible for removal because they did not involve such a dispute. For reasons that are not clear from the record, written copies of the Probate Court's March 6, 2013 orders were not mailed to the parties until September 27, 2015, two and one-half years after the hearing. On October 22, 2015, the plaintiff filed a timely appeal from those orders, which is presently pending in the Superior Court.\n   <em>\n    Connery\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Gieske\n   </em>\n   , Superior Court, judicial district of Waterbury, Docket No. UWY-CV-15-6029343-S.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On April 15, 2013, the plaintiff filed a complaint in the Superior Court, in which he alleged, inter alia, that the Probate Court lacked jurisdiction over the matters decided at the March 6, 2013 hearing because the plaintiff previously had filed an affidavit pursuant to \u00a7 45a-98a (a) indicating his intention to remove those matters to the Superior Court. The plaintiff also alleged that he was appealing from the Probate Court's March 6, 2013 orders pursuant to \u00a7 45a-186 (a). Subsequently, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, arguing that it was untimely and that, consequently, the trial court lacked jurisdiction over it. Specifically, the defendant argued that, under \u00a7 45a-186 (a), the plaintiff had thirty days to appeal from the Probate Court's March 6, 2013 orders, which he failed to do.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In response, the plaintiff argued that the present action was not an appeal but an action challenging the Probate Court's retention of jurisdiction over the case after the plaintiff filed an affidavit pursuant to \u00a7 45a-98a (a). The plaintiff also argued that, even if the present action was an appeal, it was not barred by the statute of limitations because the Probate Court had not yet mailed copies of the March 6, 2013 orders to the parties, which, under \u00a7 45a-186 (a), is required to trigger the thirty day limitations period.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The trial court rejected the plaintiff's arguments, concluding that the \"the retention of jurisdiction [by] the\n   Probate Court [over] various claims and the refusal to release them for jury trial in the Superior Court pursuant to ... [\u00a7] 45a-98a was within the jurisdiction of the Probate Court. As a result, an appeal pursuant to [General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7] 45a-186 and [45a-187 ] was the appropriate way to challenge [that] decision ....\" (Footnote omitted.) The trial court further concluded that the appeal was untimely because it was not filed within thirty days of the date on which the parties received actual notice of the Probate Court's orders. In reaching this conclusion, the trial court rejected the\n   plaintiff's assertion that, under the plain and unambiguous language of \u00a7 45a-186 (a), the time for filing an appeal does not begin to run until the Probate Court mails to the parties copies of the orders from which the appeal is being taken. In the trial court's view, that contention was untenable because, \"taken to its logical conclusion, [it] would [mean] ... that there is no limit to the time in which an oral order or decision of the Probate Court could be appealed. An equally unpalatable conclusion is that such orders cannot be appealed because they are not authorized by the applicable statute.\" \"Either interpretation,\" the trial court concluded, \"is repugnant\" to the well established principle favoring the speedy settlement of estates.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In so concluding, the trial court also noted an apparent conflict between a provision in \u00a7 45a-186 (a) indicating that the appeals period commences with the mailing of the Probate Court's order or decree and General Statutes \u00a7 51-53,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   which requires court clerks to immediately\n   notify a party, in writing, of any decision of a court unless that party was present when the decision was rendered, in which case such notice is not required. Although the trial court acknowledged that, effective July 1, 2013, the Probate Court is required to \"memorialize each oral ruling in writing\"; Probate Court Rules \u00a7 3.3; it did not consider that rule to be relevant to its interpretation of \u00a7 45a-186 because that provision went into effect several months after the oral orders in the present case were rendered. The trial court reasoned that, because written notification of the orders was not required on March 6, 2013, giving effect to the plain language of \u00a7 45a-186 would lead to \"the type of 'absurd or unworkable' result that authorizes resort to legislative history,\" namely, an appeal theoretically could be taken at any time.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The trial court then turned to the legislative history of \u00a7 45a-187 for guidance, explaining that, prior to a 2011 amendment to \u00a7 45a-187 that became effective October 1, 2011; see Public Acts 2011, No. 11-128, \u00a7 13 (P.A. 11-128); \u00a7 45a-187 (a) provided in relevant part that \"[a]n appeal under section 45a-186... shall be taken within thirty days, except as otherwise provided in this section....\" General Statutes (Rev. to 2011) \u00a7 45a-187 (a). The court further explained that, in 2011, the legislature deleted this language from the statute and, in its place, added that an appeal from an order of the Probate Court \"shall be taken within the time provided in section 45a-186....\" P.A. 11-128, \u00a7 13, codified at General Statutes (Supp. 2012) \u00a7 45a-187 (a). The trial court noted that the 2011 amendment was necessary because, in 2007, \u00a7 45a-186 (a) was amended to include a forty-five day limitations period for certain specified appeals. See Public Acts 2007, No. 07-116, \u00a7 2 (P.A. 07-116), codified at General Statutes (Supp. 2008) \u00a7 45a-186 (a). According to the trial court, this 2007 amendment created considerable confusion about\n   whether that statute's forty-five day limitations period or the thirty day limitations period of \u00a7 45a-187 (a) applied to the specified appeals. The trial court noted, however, that the legislative\n   history surrounding the 2011 amendment gave no indication that, in addition to eliminating the aforementioned confusion, the legislature intended to overrule prior precedent interpreting the limitations period of \u00a7 45a-187 (a) as commencing at the time of actual notice. The trial court concluded, therefore, that the plaintiff's action was untimely and granted the defendant's motion to dismiss.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the trial court incorrectly concluded that the present action is an appeal. The plaintiff argues that, instead, it is an action to vindicate his right to a jury trial under \u00a7 45a-98a (a). The plaintiff maintains that the Probate Court lost jurisdiction over the case when he filed an affidavit pursuant to \u00a7 45a-98a (a) indicating his intent to remove the case to the Superior Court. The plaintiff further argues that, even if the present action is an appeal, the trial court incorrectly concluded that it is barred by the statute of limitations because, under \u00a7 45a-186 (a), the limitations period does not commence until the orders appealed from are mailed to the parties.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   For the reasons set forth hereinafter, we conclude that the Probate Court had jurisdiction to decide the matters before it on March 6, 2013, and, therefore, the trial court properly treated the present action as an appeal. We further conclude that the trial court incorrectly determined that the appeal was barred by the statute of limitations set forth in \u00a7 45a-186 (a) because it was not filed within thirty days of the March 6, 2013 hearing. Rather, we conclude that, consistent with the dictates of \u00a7 45a-186 (a), the statute of limitations began to run when the orders were mailed to the parties, which did not occur until September 27, 2015. It is apparent, therefore, that the defect in the plaintiff's\n   appeal is not that it was filed too late but, rather, that it was filed too soon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   The following principles guide our resolution of this appeal. \"A motion to dismiss ... properly attacks the jurisdiction of the court, essentially asserting that the plaintiff cannot as a matter of law and fact state a cause of action that should be heard by the court.... Whether an issue implicates subject matter jurisdiction is a question of law over which our review is plenary.\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Heussner\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Hayes\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3963554\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/289/795/#p802\">\n    289 Conn. 795\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 802,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=961%20A.2d%20365\">\n    961 A.2d 365\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   We previously have observed that courts of probate \"are statutory tribunals that have no common-law jurisdiction.... Accordingly, [these courts] can exercise only such powers as are conferred on them by statute.... They have jurisdiction only when the facts exist on which the legislature has conditioned the exercise of their power.... [A] court [that] exercises a limited and statutory jurisdiction is without jurisdiction to act unless it does so under the precise circumstances and in the manner particularly prescribed by the enabling legislation.\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    In re Joshua S\n   </em>\n   .,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"831874\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/260/182/#p214\">\n    260 Conn. 182\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 214,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=796%20A.2d%201141\">\n    796 A.2d 1141\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2002). Despite these limitations, it is axiomatic that courts, including courts of limited jurisdiction, \"have jurisdiction to determine [their] own jurisdiction once [it] has been put in issue.\"\n   <em>\n    Castro\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Viera\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"537555\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/207/420/#p430\">\n    207 Conn. 420\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 430,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=541%20A.2d%201216\">\n    541 A.2d 1216\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1988) ; see also\n   <em>\n    Community Collaborative of Bridgeport, Inc\n   </em>\n   . v.\n   <em>\n    Ganim\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"72551\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/241/546/#p552\">\n    241 Conn. 546\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 552,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=698%20A.2d%20245\">\n    698 A.2d 245\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1997) ;\n   <em>\n    Golden Hill Paugussett Tribe of Indians\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Southbury\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"740829\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/231/563/#p570\">\n    231 Conn. 563\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 570-71,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=651%20A.2d%201246\">\n    651 A.2d 1246\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1995). Thus, contrary to the plaintiff's contention, the Probate Court clearly had jurisdiction to determine whether it had jurisdiction to decide the matters before it on March 6, 2013. Indeed, the plaintiff has cited no authority to the contrary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   Accordingly, as the trial court concluded, once the Probate\n   Court determined that it did have jurisdiction, the plaintiff's only recourse was to file an appeal in accordance with the provisions of \u00a7 45a-186 (a). See General Statutes \u00a7 45a-24 (\"[a]ll orders, judgments and decrees of courts of probate, rendered after notice and from which no appeal is taken, shall be conclusive and shall be entitled to full faith, credit and validity and shall not be subject to collateral attack, except for fraud\"); see also\n   <em>\n    Miller\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    McNamara\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1618901\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/135/489/#p496\">\n    135 Conn. 489\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 496,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=66%20A.2d%20359\">\n    66 A.2d 359\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1949) (\"the Superior Court has no jurisdiction to set aside a decree of a Probate Court except upon an appeal\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   We turn, therefore, to the question of whether the trial court correctly determined that the plaintiff's appeal was untimely because it was not filed within thirty days of the March 6, 2013 probate hearing. As we previously explained, the trial court concluded that the appeals period began to run at the time of the hearing because, under \u00a7 51-53, the Probate Court was not required to reduce its oral orders to writing, and because courts previously had interpreted the limitations period set forth in \u00a7 45a-187 (a) as commencing on the date of actual notice. We disagree with the trial court's interpretation of \u00a7 45a-186 for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that it fails to give effect to that statute's plain and unambiguous terms regarding the manner in which probate appeals are perfected. It is axiomatic that strict compliance with those terms is a prerequisite to an aggrieved party's right to appeal and to the Superior Court's jurisdiction over the appeal. The trial court's analysis also overlooks the fact that, in 2007, the legislature amended \u00a7 45a-186 as part of an overhaul of the procedures for filing probate appeals. See P.A. 07-116, \u00a7 2. The limitations period that was added to the statute at that time is wholly consistent with the other procedures adopted at that time. See\n   P.A. 07-116, \u00a7 2. Our review of the trial court's interpretation of \u00a7 45a-186 is de novo.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   \"When construing a statute, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature.... In other words, we seek to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply.... In seeking to determine that meaning, General Statutes \u00a7 1-2z directs us first to consider the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes.

It provides that the general limitations period for filing a probate appeal, with certain exceptions inapplicable to this appeal, is either thirty or forty-five days, depending on the appeal, and begins to run when the order, denial or decree appealed from-which must be attached to the appellant's complaint-is mailed to the parties. Under the plain and unambiguous terms of the statute, therefore, the limitations period for the plaintiff's appeal commenced\n   when the Probate Court mailed copies of the March 6, 2013 orders to the parties. Because that event did not occur until September 27, 2015, the trial court incorrectly determined that the plaintiff's appeal was filed beyond the applicable limitations period set forth in \u00a7 45a-186 (a).

In fact, the appeal was filed too soon.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The trial court did not adhere to the plain language of \u00a7 45a-186 because, in its view, to do so would lead to an absurd and unworkable result in light of \u00a7 51-53. Unlike the trial court, we do not perceive a conflict between \u00a7\u00a7 45a-186 and 51-53. The latter statute, which is located in a different title of the General Statutes that addresses the powers and duties of various judicial department personnel, provides that, unless a decision is rendered in the presence of counsel, it is the duty of the court clerk to immediately notify counsel, in writing or by electronic delivery, of the decision. See General Statutes \u00a7 51-53 (a). We do not believe that a court clerk's duty in this regard in any way conflicts with the Probate Court's implicit duty, under \u00a7 45a-186 (a), to issue written orders so that appeals can be perfected in the manner specified under that statute. Even if there were some tension between the two statutes, however, \"[i]t is a well-settled principle of construction that specific terms covering the given subject\n   matter will prevail over general language of the same or another statute [that] might otherwise prove controlling.... The provisions of one statute [that] specifically focus on a particular problem will always, in the absence of express contrary legislative intent, be held to prevail over provisions of a different statute more general in its coverage.\"\n   (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Housatonic Railroad Co\n   </em>\n   . v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Revenue Services\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6775397\" index=\"30\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/301/268/#p302\">\n    301 Conn. 268\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 302,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20A.3d%20759\">\n    21 A.3d 759\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011). In the present case, therefore, the specific terms of \u00a7 45a-186 (a) governing the manner in which probate appeals are perfected necessarily trump the more general provisions of \u00a7 51-53 (a) addressing the duties of a court clerk.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In reaching a contrary conclusion, the trial court also relied on the fact that, under the statute of limitations applicable to probate appeals before the 2007 amendment to \u00a7 45a-186 ; see P.A. 07-116, \u00a7 2; the appeals period commenced when a party received actual notice of the decree. The pre-2007 amendment version of the statute was part of a statutory scheme that did not require a party aggrieved by a decision of the Probate Court to attach a copy of that decision to his or her complaint in the Superior Court. Compare, e.g., General Statutes (Rev. to 2007) \u00a7 45a-186 (a), with General Statutes (Supp. 2008) \u00a7 45a-186 (a).

General Statutes [Rev. to 2007] \u00a7 45a-192, also repealed by P.A. 07-116 [\u00a7 33], required the Probate Court to issue an order specifying the notice to be given by the appellant to interested persons.

In its place, however, the legislature enacted two new requirements, one explicit and one implicit: (1) that the aggrieved party attach a copy of the order or decision appealed from to his or her complaint in the Superior Court; see P.A. 07-116, \u00a7 2, codified at General Statutes (Supp. 2008) \u00a7 45a-186 (a) ; and (2) that the Probate Court enable compliance with the first requirement by providing the aggrieved party with a copy of the order or decision.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Problems evidently arose, as they often do, with the implementation of the new statutory scheme. One of them was the legislature's failure to repeal the old statute of limitations, which, as we previously discussed, the legislature addressed in 2011. See P.A. 11-128, \u00a7 13. Another was the legislature's apparent failure to make sufficiently clear that oral orders of the Probate Court must be reduced to writing so that appeals can be perfected in the manner specified under the new law. That problem also was addressed in 2013, with the adoption of \u00a7 3.3 of the Probate Court Rules. We do not believe, however, that either problem rendered the statute of limitations set forth in \u00a7 45a-186 unworkable, as the trial court concluded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   We nevertheless affirm the trial court's judgment in light of the fact that the Probate Court did not issue a written decision until more than two years after the plaintiff filed this appeal, such that a copy of the decision could not be appended to the complaint as required by \u00a7 45a-186 (a).
