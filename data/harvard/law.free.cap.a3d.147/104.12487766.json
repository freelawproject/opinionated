J.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The primary issue that we must resolve in this appeal is whether the trial court should have instructed the jury that the defendant, The Boy Scouts\n   of America Corporation,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   could not be held responsible for the sexual abuse of the plaintiff, John Doe,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   by a fellow member of the Boy Scouts unless the plaintiff proved that the defendant's own conduct increased the risk that the plaintiff would be subjected to such abuse. The plaintiff brought this action against the defendant claiming that, while he was a member of a Boy Scout troop during the mid-1970s, he was sexually abused during scouting activities by his Boy Scout patrol leader, Siegfried Hepp. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant negligently had failed to take adequate precautions to prevent Hepp's sexual abuse of the plaintiff. In addition, the plaintiff alleged negligent infliction of emotional distress, recklessness and a violation of the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA), General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq. After a trial, the jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff on all claims. The trial court ultimately rendered judgment in accordance with the verdict, and this appeal followed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant claims on appeal that: (1) the trial court improperly denied its request to charge the jury that the defendant could not be held liable for negligence unless the plaintiff proved\n   that the defendant's conduct created or increased the risk that the plaintiff would be harmed by Hepp; (2) the defendant had no duty to protect the plaintiff from Hepp's criminal or intentional misconduct because it did nothing to increase the risk of harm to the plaintiff and the harm was not foreseeable; (3) the plaintiff presented insufficient evidence to support a finding that the defendant's conduct had caused the plaintiff's damages; (4) the plaintiff presented insufficient evidence to support a finding that the defendant had been reckless; (5) the trial court incorrectly determined that the statute of limitations set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 52-577d rather than that set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 52-584 applied to the plaintiff's negligence and recklessness claims; (6) the trial court incorrectly determined that the statute of limitations set forth in \u00a7 52-577d rather than that set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 42-110g (f) applied to the plaintiff's CUTPA claim; and (7) the damages award was excessive. We agree with the defendant's first claim and, therefore, conclude\n   that the judgment must be reversed and the case must be remanded for a new trial at which the jury may be properly instructed on the defendant's negligence claim. We further agree with the defendant's sixth claim that the trial court improperly determined that \u00a7 52-577d applies to the plaintiff's CUTPA claim. We reject the defendant's second through fifth claims, however, and we need not reach his seventh claim because we are remanding the case for a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The record reveals the following facts that the jury reasonably could have found and the procedural history. The defendant is a nonprofit organization chartered by Congress in 1910. The defendant issues charters to local volunteer groups, known as local councils, which are incorporated as charitable organizations in the states in which they are located. In turn, the local councils issue charters to local community organizations,\n   such as churches, schools or service clubs, that want to establish a Boy Scout troop. The chartered local organization then forms a troop committee for the purpose of providing oversight to the local troop, including choosing the troop's adult leaders.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   From the 1920s through the mid-1970s, the defendant maintained in a central location files containing the names of persons who were ineligible to volunteer as members of the local chartered organization or as troop leaders because they had been the subjects of allegations of sexual misconduct (ineligible volunteer files).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   When an ineligible volunteer file was created, the volunteer's registration was revoked and he was barred from participating in the Boy Scouts in the future. Most of the ineligible volunteer files involved allegations against adults, but a number of files were created for minors under the age of eighteen.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Although the defendant maintained the ineligible volunteer files in its offices, information regarding a volunteer's alleged misconduct was ordinarily shared with the local council, and the ineligible volunteer was notified by letter when a file was created. The files were confidential, however, and were not made available to the general public.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The plaintiff, who was born in June, 1964, was a member of a Boy Scout troop in New Fairfield during the mid-1970s. The troop had thirty-five to forty members and was subdivided into patrols of five to seven members. Hepp, who was born in 1961, was the plaintiff's patrol leader. Hepp sexually abused the plaintiff on three separate occasions. On the first two occasions, Hepp and the plaintiff were at a Boy Scout camp. Hepp asked the plaintiff if he wanted to go fishing and then, when they were alone in the woods, Hepp showed the\n   plaintiff pornography and performed oral sex on him. On the third occasion, Hepp and the plaintiff were at a Boy Scout jamboree. Hepp came into the plaintiff's tent at the end of the day, told the plaintiff to take his pants off and then performed anal sex on him.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   In 2012, the plaintiff brought this action alleging that he had suffered physical, emotional and psychological injuries as the result of the sexual assaults by Hepp, and that the defendant was liable for his damages because it had negligently failed to take adequate steps to prevent his injuries. In addition, the plaintiff alleged that the defendant had negligently inflicted emotional distress, that its conduct was reckless and that its conduct constituted a\n   CUTPA violation. The defendant claimed by way of special defenses that the plaintiff's negligence and recklessness claims were barred by \u00a7 52-584 or, in the alternative, by General Statutes \u00a7 52-577, that Hepp's intentional criminal acts were intervening causes that superseded any negligence by the defendant, that the plaintiff failed to mitigate his damages, and that the CUTPA claim was barred by \u00a7 42-110g (f).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The defendant subsequently filed a motion for summary judgment claiming, among other things, that it was entitled to judgment as a matter of law because it owed no duty of care to the plaintiff under the circumstances of this case, that the plaintiff had failed to establish a prima facie case with respect to its recklessness and CUTPA claims, and that the CUTPA claim was barred by the statute of limitations. The trial court denied the defendant's motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   At trial, the plaintiff's theory was that the defendant had been negligent because, even though it had been aware of numerous incidents of sexual abuse during scouting activities in the decades preceding the 1970s, both by adult and by minor Boy Scout participants, it failed to take precautions against sexual abuse by: (1)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   providing education or training to local councils about the risk of sexual abuse; (2) distributing information or training to Boy Scout members or their parents regarding the risk of sexual abuse; and (3) creating other barriers to minimize the risk of sexual abuse. In support of these claims, the plaintiff presented evidence in the form of expert testimony by Michael Kalinowski, an associate professor of family studies and human development at the University of New Hampshire and a former member of the New Hampshire Task Force on Sexual Abuse Prevention, with special expertise in the subject of institutional responsibilities for keeping children safe. Kalinowski testified that, in his opinion, the defendant's failure to inform the public about the risk of sexual abuse during Boy Scout activities created a dangerous situation for members of the Boy Scouts and was negligent. In addition, Gary Schoener, a clinical psychologist with expertise in assisting institutions to set up programs to prevent sexual abuse in institutional settings, testified that, on the basis of his review of the ineligible volunteer files, it was his opinion that the defendant must have been aware before the mid-1970s of incidents of sexual abuse of members of the Boy Scouts by fellow members. The plaintiff also entered into evidence three Scout Handbooks, published in 1972, 1975 and 1976 under the auspices of, and copyrighted by, the defendant. The Scout Handbooks generally promoted camping as a central activity of the Boy Scouts and stated that some patrols may choose to go on overnight camping trips by themselves, led only by a patrol leader and with no adult supervision.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   At the conclusion of the plaintiff's case, the defendant filed a motion for a directed verdict in which it contended, among other things, that the plaintiff's negligence and recklessness claims were barred by \u00a7 52-584 or \u00a7 52-577, that the defendant had no duty to protect the plaintiff, that the plaintiff had failed to prove that the defendant caused his damages, and that the CUTPA claim was barred by\n   the statute of limitations. The trial court denied the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   At the conclusion of the presentation of evidence, the defendant submitted a request to charge the jury that contained the following proposed instruction: \"The plaintiff claims that ... Hepp engaged in intentional misconduct with him. As a general matter, the [defendant is] not responsible for anticipating the intentional misconduct of a third party, in this case Hepp, unless [it] knew or had reason to know of Hepp's propensity for misconduct from 1976 to 1978.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   In addition, the defendant requested the following instruction: \"The first exception to the rule that the [defendant is] not responsible for anticipating the intentional misconduct of Hepp unless [it] knew or should have known of his propensity for misconduct is when the [defendant's] own conduct created or increased the foreseeable risk that the plaintiff would be harmed by the misconduct of a third party.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \"In order to answer that question, you should consider all of the following factors: the known character, past conduct, and tendencies of Hepp; the temptation or opportunity which the [defendant's] conduct may afford [Hepp] for such behavior; the gravity of the harm which may result; and the possibility that some other person will assume the responsibility for preventing the conduct or the harm, together with the burden of the precautions which the [defendant] would be required to take. Where the risk is relatively slight in comparison\n   with the utility of the [defendant's] conduct, [it] may have no obligation to act.\" The trial court declined to give either of the instructions that the defendant requested but, instead, gave a standard negligence instruction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff on all counts and awarded $4 million in compensatory damages on the plaintiff's negligence claim, $3 million in compensatory damages on the claim of negligent infliction of emotional distress, and $10 in damages on the CUTPA claim. In addition to these damages, the trial court awarded punitive damages measured by attorney's fees in the amount of $2,792,541.95 and litigation costs in the amount of $59,558.50 on the recklessness claim, offer of compromise interest on that claim in the amount of $616,053.68, and offer of compromise interest on the negligence and negligent infliction of emotional distress claims in the amount of $1,386,001.98, for a total damages award of $11,854,166.11.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   After the jury verdict, the defendant filed a motion to set aside the verdict and order a new trial or remittitur pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 16-35. The defendant contended,\n   among other things, that it had no duty to protect the plaintiff under the circumstances of the case, that the plaintiff had failed to prove that the defendant caused his damages, that the plaintiff had failed to prove that the defendant was reckless, and that the trial court improperly had given a general negligence instruction to the jury. The defendant further contended that the $7 million compensatory damages award was excessive and requested a remittitur or, in the event that the plaintiff did not accept a remittitur, a new trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The defendant also filed a motion to set aside the verdict and to render judgment notwithstanding the verdict pursuant to Practice Book \u00a7 16-37. In that motion, the defendant repeated its contentions that it had no duty to protect the plaintiff and that the plaintiff had failed to prove causation, recklessness or a CUTPA violation. In addition, the defendant contended that the plaintiff's negligence, negligent infliction of emotional distress and recklessness claims were barred either by \u00a7 52-584 or, in the alternative, by \u00a7 52-577, and that the CUTPA claim was barred by \u00a7 42-110g (f). The trial court denied both motions and rendered judgment for the plaintiff in accordance with the verdict. This appeal followed.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   We first address the defendant's claim that the trial court improperly denied its request to instruct the jury that the defendant could not be held liable for negligence unless the plaintiff proved that the defendant's\n   conduct created or increased the risk that the plaintiff would be harmed by Hepp. We agree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   \"We begin with the well established standard of review governing the defendant's challenge to the trial court's jury instruction. Our review of the defendant's claim requires that we examine the [trial] court's entire charge to determine whether it is reasonably possible that the jury could have been misled by the omission of the requested instruction. ... While a request to charge that is relevant to the issues in a case and that accurately states the applicable law must be honored, a [trial] court need not tailor its charge to the precise letter of such a request. ... If a requested charge is in substance given, the [trial] court's failure to give a charge in exact conformance with the words of the request will not constitute a ground for reversal. ...

Unlike in\n   <em>\n    Doe\n   </em>\n   , however, the defendant in the present case requested an instruction that was an\n   <em>\n    accurate\n   </em>\n   statement of the law and that would not have prevented the plaintiff from establishing the foreseeability of Hepp's misconduct on the basis of evidence other than\n   Hepp's personal propensity to engage in sexual abuse. In fact, the defendant requested a statement of the law that this court explicitly adopted in\n   <em>\n    Doe\n   </em>\n   . Accordingly, the present case is distinguishable from\n   <em>\n    Doe\n   </em>\n   because the defendant requested an accurate statement of the law that was relevant to the issues in the case. We conclude, therefore, that the trial court improperly denied the defendant's request to instruct the jury that the defendant could not be held liable for negligence unless the plaintiff proved that the defendant's conduct created or increased the risk that the plaintiff would be harmed by Hepp.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   At oral argument before this court, the plaintiff further contended that the jury instructions that the defendant requested would have been misleading because several of the factors that the defendant referred to are not present here. Specifically, the plaintiff contended that, because he made no claim that the defendant was\n   on notice that \"the known character, past conduct, and tendencies of\n   <em>\n    Hepp\n   </em>\n   [or] the temptation or opportunity which the defendant's conduct may afford\n   <em>\n    him\n   </em>\n   for such behavior\"; (emphasis added); created an increased risk of harm to the plaintiff, those factors were irrelevant. Again, we are not persuaded. This court held in\n   <em>\n    Doe\n   </em>\n   that the known propensities of the individual who engaged in intentional misconduct\n   is a factor that the jury properly may consider when determining whether a defendant negligently failed to take precautions against the misconduct.\n   <em>\n    Doe\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Saint Francis Hospital &amp; Medical Center\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=309%20Conn.%20146\">\n    309 Conn. at 179\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=72%20A.3d%20929\">\n    72 A.3d 929\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[f]actors to be considered are the known character, past conduct, and tendencies of the person whose intentional conduct causes the harm\" [internal quotation marks omitted] ).\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   The factor does not become irrelevant merely because it favors the defendant. Accordingly, we reject this claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   We next address the defendant's contention that the trial court improperly rejected its claim that it had no\n   duty to protect the plaintiff from Hepp's intentional misconduct because the defendant did nothing to increase the risk of harm to the plaintiff and the harm was not reasonably foreseeable. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   Although the defendant frames this claim as involving a question about the existence of a legal duty, it concedes that it would have had a duty to protect the plaintiff if Hepp's misconduct had been foreseeable under the factors for determining the foreseeability of intentional misconduct of a third party set forth in\n   <em>\n    Doe\n   </em>\n   .

Thus, the essence of the defendant's claim is that the plaintiff failed to present sufficient evidence in support of those factors.

For example, the plaintiff in the present case could have claimed either that: (1) by engaging in the affirmative act of promoting certain activities, despite its knowledge that those activities increased the risk that participants would be subject to sexual abuse, the defendant negligently created an unreasonable risk of harm to the plaintiff; or (2) having created an unreasonable risk that participants in certain activities would be subject to sexual abuse, the defendant was required to take affirmative steps to guard against the risk-such as educating the participants about the risk-and negligently failed to do so.

Opportunities for groups of minors, who are either unsupervised or can easily evade supervision, to spend extended periods of time together in remote and secluded places are not \"everywhere.\" Even if the percentage of participants in the Boy Scouts who were sexual predators was no greater than the percentage of sexual predators in the general population, a jury reasonably could find that these activities provided participants with a greater opportunity to engage in sexual abuse. A jury also could reasonably infer that this increased opportunity would, in fact, attract a disproportionate number of individuals with sexually predatory inclinations.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   Accordingly, although\n   the plaintiff did not present evidence of the precise mathematical degree of the risk of sexual misconduct created by such activities, a jury reasonably could infer that promoting such activities increased the risk to an unreasonable degree and that the defendant knew or should have known of the increased risk. Of course, the defendant is free to present countervailing evidence and to argue to the jury on remand that there was no increased risk, that, if there was an increased risk, it did not know and had no reason to know of the increased risk, or that any increase in risk was not unreasonable in light of the social utility of the activities.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   To the extent that the defendant contends that it should be categorically exempt from liability for negligent conduct that increases the risk of intentional misconduct by others\n   <em>\n    as a matter of law\n   </em>\n   because the benefits that its activities and programs provide to boys and adolescents outweigh any risks, we disagree. The jury not only is required to weigh the benefits of Boy Scout activities against any risks when determining whether the defendant was negligent, it must also consider the extent to which taking precautions, such as educating participants about the risks of participation, would burden the defendant. See\n   <em>\n    Doe\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Saint Francis Hospital &amp; Medical Center\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=309%20Conn.%20146\">\n    309 Conn. at 179-80\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"47\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=72%20A.3d%20929\">\n    72 A.3d 929\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (jury must consider \"the burden of the precautions which the actor would be required to take\" [internal quotation marks omitted] ). Even if we were to agree with the defendant that the benefits of participating in Boy Scout activities outweigh the risks as a matter of law and, therefore, the defendant was not required to stop promoting such activities-a question that we need not decide here-we do not agree that a reasonable person would be compelled to conclude that taking precautions against the risks would have been so unduly burdensome that the defendant reasonably could not\n   have been expected to do so.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Because this is a question on\n   which reasonable people may disagree, it is a question for the jury.

The defendant requested a jury instruction on\n    <em>\n     duty\n    </em>\n    , i.e., that \"the [defendant is] not responsible for anticipating the intentional misconduct ... unless [it] knew or had reason to know of Hepp's propensity for misconduct,\" which is not the same as an instruction on\n    <em>\n     causation\n    </em>\n    , i.e., that \"the defendant did not legally cause the injury\n    <em>\n     even though\n    </em>\n    [\n    <em>\n     its\n    </em>\n    ]\n    <em>\n     negligence was a substantial factor in bringing the injury about\n    </em>\n    .\" (Emphasis added.)

Accordingly, the instruction given by the trial court was not substantially similar to the instruction that the defendant requested.

See 29 H.R. Proc., Pt. 12, 1986 Sess., p. 4388, remarks of Representative Richard Tulisano. The purpose of \u00a7 52-577d was to afford a person who was a juvenile victim of sexual abuse to \"[gain] some control\" after he or she reaches the age of majority and \"to seek some sense of satisfaction and some sense of being able to say [he or she has] been made whole through their own actions ....\"\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7767789\" index=\"88\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/921/82/#p83\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n    remarks of Representative Tulisano; see also\n    <em>\n     Roberts\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Caton\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"549933\" index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/224/483/#p493\">\n     224 Conn. 483\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 493,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=619%20A.2d%20844\">\n     619 A.2d 844\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1993) (\"one object of \u00a7 52-577d is to afford a plaintiff sufficient time to recall and come to terms with traumatic childhood events before he or she must\n    take action\"). Moreover, during the debates on the 2002 amendment to \u00a7 52-577d ; see footnote 22 of this opinion; Representative Michael Lawlor stated broadly that the statute \"applies to claims or causes of action [arising] from\" sexual abuse of a minor. 45 H.R. Proc., Pt. 13, 2002 Sess., p. 3955. In addition, at the hearings before the Judiciary Committee, Helen Meganigle, the chairperson of the Victims Rights Committee of the Connecticut Bar Association, referred to the sexual abuse scandal in the Catholic Church, and that church's responsibility for\n    failing to take steps to prevent the abuse, when she urged the legislature to extend the statute of limitations. Conn. Joint Standing Committee Hearings, Judiciary, Pt. 6, 2002 Sess., p. 1772 (\"[w]hen the Catholic Church [failed to take steps to address the problem of sexual abuse by clergy], [it] committed a gross error of judgment and now something has to be done to address the issue\"). A conclusion that \u00a7 52-577d does not apply to claims involving negligent conduct would be totally inconsistent with this legislative intent to afford an opportunity for minor victims of sexual assaults caused by such institutional negligence to be made whole.\n    <footnotemark>\n     23\n    </footnotemark>\n    We simply can perceive no legitimate reason why the legislature would have wanted to exempt persons or entities whose negligent conduct legally caused a plaintiff's injuries from also being held liable for their misconduct.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-64\">\n    Finally, over the last twenty-two years, there have been numerous decisions in Connecticut courts holding that negligence claims against nonperpetrators were subject to the extended statute of limitations contained in \u00a7 52-577d.\n    <footnotemark>\n     24\n    </footnotemark>\n    During that time,\n    the legislature has\n    amended that statute to extend the limitations period to thirty years from the date that the plaintiff reaches the age of majority. See footnote 22 of this opinion. Despite the existence of numerous high profile cases involving claims of personal injury caused by sexual abuse against nonperpetrators, however; see, e.g.,\n    <em>\n     Rosado\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Bridgeport Roman Catholic Diocesan Corp.\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3991121\" index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/276/168/#p172\">\n     276 Conn. 168\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 172,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=884%20A.2d%20981\">\n     884 A.2d 981\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2005) (case involved \"twenty-three lawsuits [in which nonperpetrator was named defendant] alleging sexual abuse of minors by clergymen employed by the Bridgeport Roman Catholic Diocesan Corporation,\" all of which had been brought in the mid-1990s); and despite numerous trial court decisions that have held that \u00a7 52-577d applies to negligence claims; see footnote 24 of this opinion; the legislature did not amend \u00a7 52-577d to limit its application to claims against perpetrators. Thus, we may presume that the legislature acquiesces in this interpretation of the statute.

Rather, \u00a7 52-577d applies to the plaintiff's tort claims and \u00a7 42-110g (f) applies to his CUTPA claim, in accordance with the intent of the legislature. Indeed, the plaintiff has cited no authority in support of his claim that a statutory CUTPA action may be subject to different statutes of limitations depending on the underlying nature of the alleged unfair trade practice. In light of this conclusion, we need not address the defendant's claim that applying \u00a7 52-577d to the CUTPA claim would deprive the defendant of its due process rights under the state and federal constitutions.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-73\">\n    In support of his claim to the contrary, the plaintiff relies on the \"well established principle of statutory interpretation that requires courts to apply the more specific statute relating to a particular subject matter in favor of the more general statute that otherwise might apply in the absence of the specific statute.\"\n    <em>\n     Housatonic Railroad Co.\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Commissioner of Revenue Services\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6775397\" index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/301/268/#p301\">\n     301 Conn. 268\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 301-302,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=21%20A.3d%20759\">\n     21 A.3d 759\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2011). This principle comes into play, however, only when two statutes of limitations apply to the\n    <em>\n     same claim\n    </em>\n    and, therefore, both statutes cannot be given full effect. For example, although the express terms of \u00a7 52-584, considered in isolation, would apply to negligence actions for personal injury caused by sexual abuse, because \u00a7 52-577d applies specifically to such actions, and because both statutes obviously cannot apply to the same claim, we have concluded that \u00a7 52-577d trumps \u00a7 52-584. As we have explained, however, \u00a7 52-577d and \u00a7 42-110g (f) do not conflict because they apply to separate and\n    distinct claims and, therefore, we are not required to choose between them. Accordingly, we reject the plaintiff's claim.\n    The judgment is reversed and the case is remanded with direction to grant the defendant's motion for summary judgment on the CUTPA count and to render partial judgment thereon for the defendant, and for a new trial on the remaining counts of the complaint in accordance with this opinion.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-74\">\n    In this opinion SHELDON, J., concurred, and ZARELLA, ESPINOSA and ROBINSON, Js., concurred in parts I and VI of the opinion and with the disposition of reversal of the judgment and remand for a new trial.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-75\">\n    ZARELLA, J., with whom ESPINOSA and ROBINSON, Js., join, concurring in part and dissenting in part.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-76\">\n    I agree with and join parts I and VI\n    <footnotemark>\n     1\n    </footnotemark>\n    of the majority opinion\n    <footnotemark>\n     2\n    </footnotemark>\n    and agree with the majority's determination not to reach the issue of whether the award of damages was excessive.

Not only does the plain language of \u00a7 52-577d support this construction, but the statutory scheme pertaining to statutes of limitations, the relevant legislative history, and case law from other jurisdictions also indicate that \u00a7 52-577d does not apply to actions alleging negligence or recklessness. I would thus conclude that, because the two year limitation period set forth in \u00a7 52-584 expired before the plaintiff commenced the present action, the matter is time barred.\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-78\">\n    Section 52-577d provides in relevant part: \"Notwithstanding the provisions of section 52-577, no action to recover damages for personal injury to a minor, including emotional distress, caused by sexual abuse ... may be brought by such person later than thirty years\n    from the date such person attains the age of majority.\" The majority acknowledges that \"\u00a7 52-577d expressly provides that [General Statutes] \u00a7 52-577, which applies to intentional torts, does not apply to claims involving personal injury to a minor caused by sexual abuse, [whereas] \u00a7 52-577d makes no mention of \u00a7 52-584, which applies to claims of personal injury arising from negligence or recklessness ....\" Text accompanying footnote 20 of the majority opinion. The majority concludes, however, that the omission of \u00a7 52-584 \"tends to create some ambiguity concerning the statute's scope ....\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Part V of the majority opinion, quoting\n    <em>\n     Doe\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Indian Mountain School, Inc\n    </em>\n    .,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"7767789\" index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/921/82/#p83\">\n     921 F.Supp. 82\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 83 (D.Conn.1995). In my view, the legislature's deliberate omission of \u00a7 52-584 demonstrates its intent to specify that \u00a7 52-577d applies to intentional conduct only. The plain language indicates that the legislature recognized a conflict between \u00a7\u00a7 52-577 and 52-577d, making it necessary to clarify that an action for injuries caused by sexual abuse is subject to the thirty year statute of limitations in \u00a7 52-577d. Perceiving no conflict between \u00a7\u00a7 52-584 and 52-577d, however, the legislature saw no need to mention \u00a7 52-584. In other words, because \u00a7 52-577d applies to intentional conduct only, it would have been redundant to clarify that it does not apply to claims alleging negligence or recklessness. If the legislature had intended for these claims to be subject to \u00a7 52-577d, it would have provided, \"[n]otwithstanding the provisions of sections 52-577\n    <em>\n     and 52-584\n    </em>\n    \" in \u00a7 52-577d. The fact that \u00a7 52-577 is a \"catchall\" provision that applies to intentional torts and other torts not specifically mentioned in other statutes does not negate the fact that the legislature, in drafting \u00a7 52-577d, perceived and resolved a conflict between \u00a7\u00a7 52-577 and 52-577d, and perceived no such conflict between \u00a7\u00a7 52-577d and 52-584.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-79\">\n    Despite the deliberate omission of any reference to \u00a7 52-584 in \u00a7 52-577d, the majority concludes that negligence\n    and recklessness claims are subject to the thirty year statute of limitations because \"[t]he all-encompassing language of \u00a7 52-577d providing that '\n    <em>\n     no action\n    </em>\n    to recover damages for personal injury to a minor ... caused by sexual abuse' ... supports an interpretation that negligence and recklessness claims would also be subject to the thirty year statute of limitations.\" (Emphasis in original.) Part V of the majority opinion. The only way to arrive at this conclusion, however, is to disregard entirely the phrase \"[n]otwithstanding the provisions of \u00a7 52-577 \" in \u00a7 52-577d. Moreover, this conclusion\n    <em>\n     creates\n    </em>\n    a conflict between \u00a7\u00a7 52-577d and 52-584, when no such conflict exists under the plain statutory language. When \u00a7 52-577d is construed as written, it applies only when an action is\n    predicated on conduct that amounts to sexual abuse, sexual assault or sexual exploitation, all of which require intentional conduct. Under this straightforward approach, there is no conflict with \u00a7 52-584, which applies only when an action is predicated on negligent or reckless conduct. Moreover, this approach is consistent with our long-standing history of construing statutes to avoid conflict when possible. E.g.,\n    <em>\n     Tomlinson\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Tomlinson\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=305%20Conn.%20539\">\n     305 Conn. 539\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 552,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=46%20A.3d%20112\">\n     46 A.3d 112\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2012). The majority's contrary approach not only ignores the legislature's resolution of the conflict between \u00a7\u00a7 52-577d and 52-577, but creates a conflict between \u00a7\u00a7 52-577d and 52-584 where the legislature saw none.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-80\">\n    Additional language in \u00a7 52-577d compels the conclusion that it does not apply to actions sounding in negligence or recklessness. Section 52-577d provides that it applies to actions for damages \"caused by\" sexual abuse or sexual assault. The use of the narrow phrase \"caused by,\" rather than more expansive language, indicates that \u00a7 52-577d applies only when the action arises from the perpetrator's intentional act that\n    <em>\n     caused\n    </em>\n    the sexual abuse.

Heart of America Council\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     McKenzie\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6810655\" index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/sw3d/484/320/#p327\">\n     484 S.W.3d 320\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 327 (2016) (construing statute of limitations for \" 'any action to recover damages from injury ... caused by childhood sexual abuse' \" and rejecting argument that, because statute did not expressly exclude claims against nonperpetrators, such claims could be brought); see also\n    <em>\n     Walker\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Barrett\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5874743\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/650/1198/#p1209\">\n     650 F.3d 1198\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 1209 (8th Cir.2011) (rejecting argument that claim could be brought against nonperpetrator when statute of limitations governing \" '[a]ny action to recover damages from injury ... caused by childhood sexual abuse,' \" by its terms, suggested that nonperpetrator could not be held liable).\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-81\">\n    The majority offers no explanation for how the phrase \"caused by\" includes negligent or reckless conduct but concludes instead that, \"[i]f the legislature had intended to limit the application of \u00a7 52-577d to claims against perpetrators ... it could have simply said so.\" Text accompanying footnote 21 of the majority opinion. In my view, the legislature\n    <em>\n     did\n    </em>\n    say so by indicating that \u00a7 52-577d applies to injuries \"caused by\" sexual assault and by expressly incorporating a reference to \u00a7 52-577 while omitting any reference to \u00a7 52-584. Moreover, one can argue just as easily that, if the legislature had intended to extend the application of \u00a7 52-577d to nonperpetrators, it could have said so. Finally, I am not persuaded by the majority's conclusion that \u00a7 52-577d must apply to negligent and reckless conduct because it applies to tort claims for emotional distress. Because such emotional distress claims can be premised on intentional conduct or negligent conduct, a commonsense reading of \u00a7 52-577d suggests that it applies to claims for emotional distress premised on intentional conduct but does not apply to claims premised on negligent conduct.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-82\">\n    Not only does the plain language of \u00a7 52-577d compel the conclusion that it applies only to actions premised on intentional conduct, but this conclusion is also consistent\n    with the statutory framework pertaining to statutes of limitations set forth in chapter 926 of the General Statutes. This chapter, which establishes limitation periods for various types of actions, contains separate provisions for actions premised on intentional torts and all torts not specifically mentioned in other statutes; see General Statutes \u00a7 52-577 ; see also\n    <em>\n     Collens\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     New Canaan Water Co\n    </em>\n    .,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1576162\" index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/155/477/#p491\">\n     155 Conn. 477\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 491,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=234%20A.2d%20825\">\n     234 A.2d 825\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1967) ; actions premised on specific intentional torts; see, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 52-577b and 52-577c ; and actions premised on\n    negligence or recklessness. See General Statutes \u00a7 52-584. It is well established that \"[t]he enactment of [s]tatutes limiting the time within which an action may be brought are the result of a legitimate legislative determination which balances the rights and duties of competing groups.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n    <em>\n     St. Paul Travelers Co.\n    </em>\n    v\n    <em>\n     . Kuehl\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4343748\" index=\"110\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/299/800/#p809\">\n     299 Conn. 800\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 809,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"111\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=12%20A.3d%20852\">\n     12 A.3d 852\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2011). The legislature, recognizing the distinctions between intentional torts in general, specific intentional torts, and acts of negligence or recklessness, set different time periods for each type of action. Thus, under \u00a7 52-577, a plaintiff injured as a result of an intentional tort has three years from the date of the act or omission to commence an action, whereas, under \u00a7 52-584, a plaintiff injured by negligent or reckless conduct must bring the action within two years of the date when the injury is first sustained or discovered. Under General Statutes \u00a7 52-577e, there is no limitation on bringing an action when an injury has been caused by sexual assault and the party legally at fault for the injury has been convicted of sexual assault. When we consider \u00a7 52-577d in the context of this scheme, as mandated by General Statutes \u00a7 1-2z, it becomes clear that the thirty year limitation period in \u00a7 52-577d applies only to intentional conduct. To interpret the provision to apply to both intentional and negligent conduct frustrates the legislature's\n    distinctive treatment of intentional, reckless and negligent conduct, and contravenes our mandate to interpret statutes to avoid, rather than to create, conflict.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-83\">\n    The legislative history also supports the conclusion that \u00a7 52-577d does not apply to actions sounding in negligence. The majority observes that the legislation was intended \"to afford a plaintiff sufficient time to recall and come to terms with traumatic childhood events before he or she must take action ....\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Part V of the majority opinion, quoting\n    <em>\n     Roberts\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Caton\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"549933\" index=\"112\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/224/483/#p493\">\n     224 Conn. 483\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 493,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"113\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=619%20A.2d%20844\">\n     619 A.2d 844\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1993). Although I agree with this sentiment, it does not establish that the legislature intended for \u00a7 52-577d to apply to nonperpetrators. In fact, as the defendant emphasizes in its brief, a key focus of statutory debate was on the\n    <em>\n     perpetrator\n    </em>\n    of the sexual abuse. Representative Richard D. Tulisano, introducing the legislation on the floor of the House of Representatives, explained that it was intended to toll the statute of limitations so that \"a minor who has been victimized by sexual assault could bring an action against\n    <em>\n     the offender\n    </em>\n    -a civil action against\n    <em>\n     the offender\n    </em>\n    .\" (Emphasis added.) 29 H.R. Proc., Pt. 12, 1986 Sess., p. 4388. After Representative Tulisano explained that \"[m]ost of these incidents occur with caretakers, that is a parent, stepparent, uncles, individuals with whom they've been, boyfriends of their mothers ... [a]nd generally it begins to occur ... in the teen years\"; 29 H.R. Proc., Pt. 17, 1986 Sess., p. 6328; Representative William L. Wollenberg expressed his concern that victims would \"go to an attorney and ... file a civil suit against this parent or against the uncle or against the caretaker. ... They may get a judgment ... [but] it probably would be an empty judgment.\" Id., p. 6337. These remarks establish that the context for the debate was\n    whether the legislation made sense when victims might stand to recover little\n    <em>\n     from perpetrators.\n    </em>\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-84\">\n    Representative Michael D. Rybak first raised the issue of whether the proposed legislation would apply to a nonperpetrator by asking whether passage of an amendment to the proposed legislation would mean that, if an employee of a day care center committed a sexual assault, \"[d]oes [liability] fall on the employee, or does it\n    fall back on the day care center?\" Id., p. 6356. In response, Representative Tulisano responded: \"I suppose it's the institution that maintains its liability, and the individual would be liable for the incident, the individual who caused the act to occur.\" Id. Representative Tulisano then further explained: \"[T]his is [wilful] and wanton. It's an intentional act that we're talking about here under this particular proposal. So the individual would in fact be responsible personally. The day care center, I suppose as an institution may continue to have liability, but [its] policy probably will exclude [wilful] and [wanton] acts anyway, so as an institution, [it] will not be liable. And of course, the boards of directors are already protected ... so it really lies on the person who did the act for the most part, the offender.\" Id., p. 6357. This exchange supports two conclusions. First, it indicates that the proposal's sponsors had not really contemplated whether the proposed legislation would apply to anyone other than offenders. Second, it indicates that the legislators' underlying assumption was that the proposal applied to offenders only. This exchange simply cannot be interpreted to support a determination that the legislature intended for \u00a7 52-577d to apply to nonperpetrators.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-85\">\n    Moreover, when the time frame in \u00a7 52-577d was amended further by No. 91-240 of the 1991 Public Acts, Representative Tulisano again introduced the legislation by explaining that \"[a] number of years ago Connecticut was among the first states to recognize that\n    minor victims of sexual assault often do not have the independence and the opportunity to bring civil actions against the\n    <em>\n     perpetrators\n    </em>\n    of crimes against them and at that time Connecticut, in the beginning, enacted its current statute, one of the first in the nation, and the purpose of it is to give individuals an opportunity to do something for themselves.\" (Emphasis added.) 34 H.R. Proc., Pt. 13, 1991 Sess., p. 4705. The legislative debates establish the legislature's intent to provide sexual assault victims additional time to recall and take action against the perpetrators of sexual abuse. There is nothing in the legislative history, however, to indicate that the proposal would also apply to nonperpetrators.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-86\">\n    Turning to the case law, I am not persuaded by the majority's reliance on nonbinding authority from other jurisdictions as a central factor in construing a Connecticut statute. In particular, the majority relies on\n    <em>\n     Almonte\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     New York Medical College\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3877125\" index=\"114\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/851/34/#p37\">\n     851 F.Supp. 34\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (D.Conn.1994), in which the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut, after acknowledging that the Connecticut Supreme Court had never decided whether \u00a7 52-577d applies to a claim sounding in negligence; see\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3877125\" index=\"115\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/851/34/#p37\">\n     id.,\n    </extracted-citation>\n    at 37 ; concluded that \u00a7 52-577d, rather than \u00a7 52-584, applied in a negligence action.\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3877125\" index=\"116\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/851/34/#p37\">\n     Id., at 39\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Not only does the District Court's decision to decide a question of Connecticut law contravene our long-standing procedure for encouraging federal courts to certify questions of law to the Connecticut Supreme Court for decision; see Practice Book (1978-1997) \u00a7 4168; but it effectively forestalls our independent consideration of the matter. Although the analysis in\n    <em>\n     Almonte\n    </em>\n    was not binding precedent in Connecticut state courts, it became the foundation for nearly all of the subsequent trial court decisions on this issue and has now become the foundation for the present decision. See footnote 24 of the majority opinion (citing cases); cf.\n    <em>\n     Doe\n    </em>\n    v\n    <em>\n     . Flanigan\n    </em>\n    , Superior Court, judicial district of Waterbury,\n    Docket No. UWY- CV-09-501462-S (Jan. 9, 2015) (\n    <extracted-citation index=\"117\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=59%20Conn.%20L.%20Rptr.%20586\">\n     59 Conn.L.Rptr. 586\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ) (engaging in little analysis);\n    <em>\n     Truex\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Rogers\n    </em>\n    , Superior Court, judicial district of Hartford, Docket No. CV-04-0833129-S (May 10, 2006) (\n    <extracted-citation index=\"118\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=41%20Conn.%20L.%20Rptr.%20330\">\n     41 Conn.L.Rptr. 330\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ) (relying on\n    <em>\n     See\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Bridgeport Roman Catholic Diocesan Corp\n    </em>\n    ., Superior Court, judicial district of Fairfield, Docket No. CV-93-0300948-S,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"119\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20Conn.%20L.%20Rptr.%2051\">\n     10 Conn.L.Rptr. 51\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ). In my view, the routine reliance on\n    <em>\n     Almonte\n    </em>\n    undercuts the persuasive value of the majority's contention that, \"over the last twenty-two years, there have been numerous decisions in Connecticut courts holding that negligence claims against nonperpetrators were subject to the extended statute of limitations contained in \u00a7 52-577d.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     6\n    </footnotemark>\n    Text accompanying footnote 24 of the majority opinion.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-87\">\n    Most important, I do not find the reasoning in\n    <em>\n     Almonte\n    </em>\n    persuasive. The District Court takes no notice of the legislature's statement that \u00a7 52-577d applies in place of \u00a7 52-577 and fails to consider \u00a7 52-577d in the context of related statutes, such as \u00a7 52-577e. I also disagree with the District Court's conclusion that, because \u00a7 52-577d is focused on providing victims with a recovery for a particular type of harm and is not expressly limited to actions brought against perpetrators, it applies in negligence actions against nonperpetrators. See\n    <em>\n     Almonte\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     New York Medical College\n    </em>\n    , supra,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3877125\" index=\"120\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f-supp/851/34/#p37\">\n     851 F.Supp. at 37-39\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . The fact that \u00a7 52-577d serves to allow recovery for victims of sexual abuse does not mean that \u00a7 52-577d is intended to permit recovery\n    <em>\n     from nonperpetrators\n    </em>\n    . In fact, there is no indication in the statutory language or the legislative history that \u00a7 52-577d was intended to permit recovery from a person\n    who did not engage in an intentional act and did not cause the sexual abuse.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-88\">\n    Finally, although the majority refers to additional cases from other jurisdictions; see footnote 21 of the majority opinion; these cases offer little guidance to this court because they construe statutes that contain distinct wording and contexts. To the extent that these cases offer guidance in assessing the meaning of \u00a7 52-577d in the context of our unique statutory scheme; see General Statutes \u00a7 1-2z ; they merely indicate that courts of other jurisdictions have taken different approaches in interpreting similar provisions. As the majority acknowledges, a number of courts have interpreted statutes similar to \u00a7 52-577d to apply only to individuals who perpetrated the sexual abuse or sexual assault.\n    <footnotemark>\n     7\n    </footnotemark>\n    I am not persuaded by the majority's\n    attempt to distinguish these cases on the ground that the statutes at issue incorporated a definition of sexual assault that referred to intentional conduct committed by the perpetrator\n    or included language concerning conduct committed by the perpetrator. See footnote 21 of the majority opinion. As I discussed previously in this opinion, \u00a7 52-577d limits its application to intentional conduct by expressly providing that it applies in place of the intentional tort limitation provision of \u00a7 52-577, and not in place of the negligence or recklessness limitation provision of \u00a7 52-584. Moreover, to the extent that the cases in other jurisdictions have addressed a definition of abuse that requires intentional behavior, General Statutes \u00a7 46b-120 (7) provides in relevant part that \"[a] child or youth may be found 'abused' who (A) has been inflicted with physical injury or injuries other than by accidental means ....\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-89\">\n    Following a careful review of the plain language of \u00a7 52-577d, the statutory framework, the legislative history and relevant case law, I would conclude that \u00a7 52-577d does not apply to actions sounding in negligence or recklessness and does not apply in an action against entities or individuals who did not commit the sexual assault. I would therefore conclude that the plaintiff's action is time barred by \u00a7 52-584 because it was commenced more than two years after the plaintiff's injury was first sustained or discovered.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-90\">\n    EVELEIGH, J.,\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-91\">\n    With whom, McDONALD, J., joins, concurring and dissenting. I fully join parts II, III, IV, V, and VI of the majority opinion with the exception of the majority's conclusion that \"[w]hen the trial court has improperly instructed the jury and the improper instruction cannot be considered harmless because there is no way of knowing whether the finder of fact would have reached the same conclusion if it had been properly instructed, the proper remedy generally is to remand the case to the trial court for a new trial without considering whether the evidence presented at the first trial was sufficient to support the verdict.\" See footnote\n    12 of the majority opinion. I also respectfully dissent from part I of the majority opinion, however, because, in my view, even if the trial court's refusal to give the proposed instruction of the named defendant, The Boy Scouts of America Corporation,\n    <footnotemark>\n     1\n    </footnotemark>\n    on \u00a7 302 B of the Restatement (Second) of Torts was improper, that error was harmless. Indeed, although the majority appears to recognize the harmless error standard, it fails to conduct any detailed analysis as to whether the trial court's failure to give the defendant's proposed instruction was harmful in the present case. Furthermore, although the majority does not reach the question of whether the award of damages was excessive because it concludes that the present case must be remanded for a new trial, I would reach this issue and conclude that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the defendant's motion to set aside the verdict and an order for a new trial or remittitur. Accordingly, after careful review of the record and the parties' claims, I am persuaded that I would affirm the judgment of the trial court in favor of the plaintiff, John Doe, which it rendered in accordance with the jury's verdict, on all\n    counts except for the plaintiff's claim under the Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (CUTPA). See General Statutes \u00a7 42-110a et seq.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-92\">\n    I agree with the facts and procedural history as set forth in the majority opinion. I will provide additional facts as necessary.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-93\">\n    I\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-94\">\n    The following facts are necessary to an understanding of the parties' claims. After the presentation of evidence\n    had concluded, the defendant submitted a request to charge the jury that contained the following proposed instructions: \"The plaintiff claims that [his patrol leader] Siegfried Hepp engaged in intentional misconduct with him. As a general matter, the [defendant is] not responsible for anticipating the intentional misconduct of a third party, in this case Hepp, unless [it] knew or had reason to know of Hepp's propensity for misconduct from 1976 to 1978....\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-95\">\n    \"The first exception to the rule that the [defendant is] not responsible for anticipating the intentional misconduct of Hepp unless [it] knew or should have known of his propensity for misconduct is when the [defendant's] own conduct created or increased the foreseeable risk that the plaintiff would be harmed by the misconduct of a third party.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-96\">\n    \"In order to answer that question, you should consider all of the following factors: the known character, past conduct, and tendencies of Hepp; the temptation or opportunity which the [defendant's] conduct may afford him for such behavior; the gravity of the harm which may result; and the possibility that some other person will assume the responsibility for preventing the conduct or the harm, together with the burden of the precautions which the [defendant] would be required to take. Where the risk is relatively slight in comparison with the utility of the [defendant's] conduct, [it] may have no obligation to act.\" (Citation omitted.) The trial court declined to instruct the jury in accordance with the defendant's request and, instead, gave a standard negligence instruction.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-97\">\n    Assuming, for the sake of argument, that the majority is correct in concluding that the trial court's failure to give the instruction on \u00a7 302 B of the Restatement (Second) of Torts, as proposed by the defendant, was improper, I disagree that such an impropriety requires\n    reversal. \"We have repeatedly recognized that [i]t is axiomatic ... that not every error is harmful. ... [W]e have often stated that before a party is entitled to a new trial ... he or she has the burden of demonstrating that the error was harmful. ... An instructional impropriety is harmful if it is likely that it affected the verdict. ... In determining whether an instructional impropriety was harmless, we consider not only the nature of the error, including its natural and probable effect on a party's ability to place his full case before the jury, but the likelihood of actual prejudice as reflected in the individual trial record, taking into account (1) the state of the evidence, (2) the effect of other instructions, (3) the effect of counsel's arguments, and (4) any indications by the jury itself that it was misled.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n    <em>\n     Allison\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Manetta\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3954801\" index=\"121\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/284/389/#p400\">\n     284 Conn. 389\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 400,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"122\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=933%20A.2d%201197\">\n     933 A.2d 1197\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2007). Thus, in my view, a new trial would be necessary only if the defendant could establish on appeal that the trial court's refusal to give the requested instruction constituted harmful error. In other words, in order to establish reversible error, the defendant must prove that the jury likely would have returned a verdict in its favor had the requested instruction been given.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-98\">\n    In support of its position that the present case should be remanded for a new\n    trial, the majority cites this court's decision in\n    <em>\n     McDermott\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     State\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"123\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=316%20Conn.%20601\">\n     316 Conn. 601\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"124\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=113%20A.3d%20419\">\n     113 A.3d 419\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2015). See footnote 12 of the majority opinion.

Where the risk is relatively slight in comparison with the utility of the actor's conduct, he may be under no obligation to protect the other against it. [2 Restatement (Second), Torts \u00a7 302 B, comment (f), p. 93 (1965) ].\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) The relevant portion of the defendant's proposed charge included the factors set forth in \u00a7 302 B of the Restatement (Second) that were cited in\n    <em>\n     Saint Francis Hospital &amp; Medical Center\n    </em>\n    .\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-107\">\n    I begin with a review of the state of the evidence in this case. At the trial in this matter, the defendant did not present evidence concerning each of the factors enumerated in comment (f) to \u00a7 302 B of the Restatement (Second). Instead, at trial, the defendant focused primarily upon the known character, past conduct, and tendencies of Hepp to commit sexual abuse. Specifically, the defendant presented the testimony of a local scouting leader, Robert Gyle, whose son participated in scouting activities with both Hepp and the plaintiff. Gyle testified that he was unaware that Hepp was engaging in inappropriate sexual conduct with the other boys in the scouting program. The defendant did not focus on the other factors and, notably, did not present evidence as to the burden of implementing policies aimed at preventing sexual abuse during scouting activities.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-108\">\n    Furthermore, a review of the state of the evidence demonstrates that the evidence on the other factors supports the plaintiff's claim. First, I agree with the majority that the evidence the plaintiff presented at trial \"was sufficient to establish a prima facie case that the defendant should have realized the likelihood that [its] conduct would create a temptation which would be\n    likely to lead to [sexual abuse].\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) As the majority states, the \"plaintiff presented evidence that the defendant engaged in the affirmative acts of promoting and endorsing [scouting] activities, such as overnight camping, that created opportunities for sexual abuse.\" As the majority further recognizes, the Boy Scout Handbook\n    in effect at the relevant time stated that \"[p]atrols do lots of things outdoors. They go hiking and camping. These hikes and camps must be approved by your [s]coutmaster ahead of time. Some patrols go overnight camping by themselves. Your patrol can, too, if you have a patrol leader your [s]coutmaster will approve as an overnight camping leader.\" Although Gyle testified that going on unsupervised overnight camping trips was not the usual practice of the local council, the plaintiff testified that the adult leaders did not camp in the same area as the patrol and that the patrol leader was left in charge of the scouts.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-109\">\n    Second, as I will discuss in greater detail in part II of this concurring and dissenting opinion, the plaintiff presented evidence demonstrating that he suffered severe emotional and psychological harm. Although the defendant attempted to show that other negative factors in the plaintiff's life might have contributed to these injuries, it does not dispute the gravity of those injuries.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-110\">\n    Third, a jury could reasonably infer from the extensive testimony relating to the defendant's secrecy as to its knowledge of the prevalence of sexual abuse during scouting activities, as documented in the ineligible volunteer files,\n    <footnotemark>\n     4\n    </footnotemark>\n    that there was a slim \"possibility that some other person [would] assume the responsibility for preventing the conduct or the harm ....\" 2 Restatement\n    Second), supra, \u00a7 302 B, comment (f). For instance, Nate Marshal, the assistant director of registration service for the defendant, testified that, to the best of his knowledge, the defendant has never engaged in the practice of circulating a list of individuals deemed to be ineligible to participate in its programs, or otherwise notifying the local councils of these reported incidents of misconduct, regardless of whether there had been a criminal conviction. In fact, Marshal explained that it is the defendant's policy not to send copies of the ineligible volunteer files to the local councils, notwithstanding a request from the local council for such documentation. In addition, there was evidence presented that the defendant controlled the training programs for the local councils. For example, Louis D. Salute, a representative of the state council, testified that the local councils are not permitted by the defendant to create their own guidelines for training adult leaders. Salute testified as follows: \"We follow the national training. The ... only latitude that we have is, for instance, to require training, which we have done. But we can't add to or subtract from the training program.\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-111\">\n    Finally, I agree with the majority \"that a reasonable person would [not] be compelled to conclude that taking precautions against the risks would have been so unduly burdensome that the defendant reasonably could not have been expected to do so.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     5\n    </footnotemark>\n    As explained previously herein, the defendant did not present any evidence regarding the burden of the precautions it would be required to take.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-112\">\n    Thus, in my view, an instruction on the factors set forth in \u00a7 302 B of the Restatement (Second) likely\n    would not have affected the jury's verdict in the present\n    case because, based on the present record, the plaintiff likely would have sustained his burden to prove that the defendant owed the plaintiff a duty of reasonable care and that the defendant's failure to take precautions against sexual abuse in scouting activities proximately caused the plaintiff's injuries. Accordingly, this factor weighs in favor of sustaining the jury's verdict.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-113\">\n    Turning to the second prong of a harmless error analysis, I examine the effect of other instructions on the outcome of this case. See\n    <em>\n     Allison\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Manetta\n    </em>\n    , supra, 284 Conn. at 400,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"149\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=933%20A.2d%201197\">\n     933 A.2d 1197\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Specifically, the instructions on the element of duty and the special defense of superseding cause relate to the charge requested by the defendant.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-114\">\n    The defendant's proposed charge read in relevant part as follows: \"The first exception to the rule that the [defendant is] not responsible for anticipating the intentional misconduct of Hepp unless [it] knew or should have known of his propensity for misconduct is when the [defendant's]\n    <em>\n     own conduct\n    </em>\n    created or increased the\n    <em>\n     foreseeable\n    </em>\n    risk that the plaintiff would be harmed by the misconduct of a third party.\" (Emphasis added.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-115\">\n    In my view, the trial court's instruction on duty encompasses the substance of this portion of the defendant's proposed charge. The trial court's instruction regarding the element of duty provided in relevant part: \"A duty to use care exists when a reasonable person, knowing what the [defendant] here either knew or should have known at the time of the alleged conduct,\n    <em>\n     would foresee that the harm of the same general nature as that which occurred here was likely to result from that conduct. If harm of the same general nature as that which occurred here was foreseeable, it does not matter if the manner in which the harm that actually occurred was unusual, bizarre or unforeseeable\n    </em>\n    .\"\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-116\">\n    Emphasis added.) Both the defendant's proposed charge and the trial court's instruction on the element of duty are couched in terms of foreseeability.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-117\">\n    Moreover, I am not swayed by the defendant's contention that, by not instructing the jury on the factors set forth in \u00a7 302 B of the Restatement (Second), the trial court essentially instructed the jury that the defendant could be held \"strictly liable for any injury that occurs in scouting.\" The trial court did not instruct the jury that the defendant could be held liable for any injury occurring during scouting activities. The defendant's liability extended only to\n    <em>\n     reasonably foreseeable injuries\n    </em>\n    -those stemming from sexual abuse committed by adult volunteers or other scouts during such activities.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-118\">\n    Contrary to the defendant's contention, I further find that the trial court's instruction on superseding cause made clear to the jury that it had to find a causal link between the defendant's conduct and the plaintiff's injuries, such that a mere bystander could not be held liable for the plaintiff's injuries. The trial court's instruction regarding the defendant's special defense of superseding cause provided in relevant part as follows: \"The defendant in a defense filed in this case claims that ... [it] did not legally cause the plaintiff's alleged injury because the injury was produced, in material part, by a superseding cause.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-119\">\n    \"Now a superseding cause is an intentional harmful act, force of nature, or criminal event, unforeseen by the defendant, which intervenes in the sequence of events leading from the defendant's alleged negligence to the plaintiff's alleged injury and proximately causes that injury. Under our law, the intervention of such a superseding cause prevents the defendant from being held liable for the plaintiff's injuries on the theory that, due to such superseding\n    cause, the defendant did not legally\n    cause the injury even though [its] negligence was a substantial factor in bringing the injury about. Therefore, when a claim of superseding cause is made at trial, the plaintiff must disprove at least one essential element of that claim by a fair preponderance of the evidence in order to prove, by that standard, its own conflicting claim of legal causation.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-120\">\n    \"In this case, the defendant claims, more particularly, that Hepp's alleged intentional harmful act of sexually assaulting the plaintiff while both were [in the scouting program] was a superseding cause of the plaintiff's alleged injury, and, thus ... that [its] own negligence did not legally cause that injury. Because such intentionally harmful conduct, if unforeseeable by the defendant, would constitute a superseding cause of the plaintiff's alleged injury if it occurred as claimed by the defendant and if it proximately caused the plaintiff's injury, the plaintiff must disprove at least one essential element of that claim by a fair preponderance of the evidence in order to prove that the defendant legally caused that injury.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-121\">\n    \"The plaintiff can meet this burden by proving one of the following: one, that the conduct claimed to constitute a superseding cause did not occur as claimed by the defendant, either because it did not occur at all or because it was not engaged in with the intent to cause harm; two,\n    <em>\n     that such conduct was foreseeable by the defendant, in that the injury in question was within the scope of the risk created by the defendant's conduct;\n    </em>\n    or three, that such conduct ... was not a substantial factor in bringing about the plaintiff's alleged injury.\" (Emphasis added.)\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-122\">\n    The language of the trial court's instruction regarding the special defense of superseding cause is substantially similar to the language of the defendant's proposed charge. Neither party disputes that the plaintiff was\n    abused by Hepp during scouting activities and this fact was a central part of the plaintiff's theory. Furthermore, neither party challenges the fact that the sexual abuse the plaintiff suffered at the hands of Hepp was a substantial factor in bringing about his injuries. Accordingly, in order to prove that the defendant legally caused his injuries pursuant to the trial court's instructions, the plaintiff had to prove that Hepp's sexual abuse of the plaintiff \"was foreseeable by the defendant, in that the injury in question was within the scope of the risk created by the defendant's conduct ....\" This portion of the jury charge essentially mirrors the language of the defendant's proposed charge, which, as stated previously, read in relevant part as follows: \"The first exception to the rule that the [defendant is] not responsible for anticipating the intentional misconduct of Hepp unless [it] knew or should have known of his propensity for misconduct is when the [\n    <em>\n     defendant's\n    </em>\n    ]\n    <em>\n     own conduct created or increased the foreseeable risk that the plaintiff would be harmed\n    </em>\n    by the misconduct of a third party.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     6\n    </footnotemark>\n    (Emphasis added.)\n    The trial court's omission of the defendant's proposed instruction on the factors set forth in \u00a7 302 B of the Restatement (Second) did not prevent the defendant from establishing that it had not been negligent in failing to take precautions against sexual abuse in light of its knowledge of the ineligible volunteer files. Therefore, in my view, even assuming the trial court's instructions were incomplete, the standard negligence instruction given by the trial court did not prevent the jury from making key factual findings that likely would have affected the verdict in the present case. Accordingly, I would conclude that the second prong of the harmless error analysis-the effect of other instructions-weighs against reversing the judgment of the trial court and ordering a new trial.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-123\">\n    I now turn to the third prong of the harmless error analysis-the effect of counsel's argument.

My review of the transcript of defense counsel's opening argument demonstrates that he did not frame his theory of the case in\n    terms of factors set forth in \u00a7 302 B of the Restatement (Second). In his opening argument, rather than focus upon the question of whether the defendant's conduct created or increased the risk that the plaintiff would be harmed by Hepp, defense counsel argued that, contrary to the plaintiff's claim, the ineligible volunteer files did not give the defendant \"special knowledge about sexual abuse ....\" Specifically, with respect to the ineligible volunteer files, defense counsel argued that: (1) \"in the 1970s, the [defendant] had no more knowledge than anyone else about [the] sexual abuse of children\"; (2) \"the purpose of the ineligible volunteer files [was] to keep the bad guys out, not to study them, not to collect data on them, not to psychoanalyze them\"; and (3) the ineligible volunteer files contain information about \"adult volunteers who are accused of improper conduct ... not about\n    [children] who are alone together engaging in inappropriate conduct.\" Only the first argument, namely that the defendant did not have more knowledge about sexual abuse than other youth organizations at the time, relates to the question of whether the defendant's conduct created or increased the risk of harm to the plaintiff.\n    <footnotemark>\n     7\n    </footnotemark>\n    Furthermore, in his opening argument, defense counsel asked the jury to consider whether other factors in the plaintiff's life may have caused his injuries, rather than Hepp's sexual abuse of the plaintiff. Therefore, it was not evident from the defendant's opening argument that it intended to present evidence with respect to each of the factors set for in \u00a7 302 B of the Restatement (Second).\n    Finally, there is no indication in the record that the jury was confused or misled. For instance, there is no evidence that the jury requested to be recharged or submitted notes to the court requesting clarification of the charge. Thus, I would conclude that the defendant has failed to satisfy its burden to show that it is likely that the trial court's omission of the defendant's proposed instruction affected the verdict. Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-124\">\n    II\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-125\">\n    Because I would conclude that the trial court's omission of the defendant's proposed instruction was harmless, I would reach the merits of the defendant's claim that the trial court improperly denied its motion to set aside the verdict and order a new trial or remittitur.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-126\">\n    On appeal, the defendant claims that the trial court abused its discretion in denying its motion to set aside the verdict and order a new trial or remittitur because the jury's compensatory damages awards for the plaintiff's claims of negligence and negligent infliction of emotional distress were excessive as a matter of law. Specifically, the defendant claims that the total $7 million compensatory damages award \"should shock the conscience of [this] court.\" The defendant further contends that the jury's award of $4 million for the plaintiff's negligence claim should be remitted because it is duplicative of the jury's award of $3 million for the plaintiff's negligent infliction of emotional distress claim. In response, the plaintiff contends that the award was neither shocking nor inconsistent with the evidence that had been adduced at trial. I agree with the plaintiff.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-127\">\n    \"Our analysis of this claim is guided by certain governing principles, which are applicable when reviewing appeals regarding motions to set aside a verdict as well as motions for remittitur. Because an award of damages is a matter peculiarly within the province of the trier\n    of facts, we have held consistently that a court should exercise its authority to order a remittitur rarely-only in the most exceptional of circumstances. ... In determining whether to order remittitur, the trial court is required to review the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict. ... Upon completing that review, the court should not interfere with the jury's determination except when the verdict is plainly excessive or exorbitant. ... The ultimate test which must be applied to the verdict by the trial court is whether the\n    jury's award falls somewhere within the necessarily uncertain limits of just damages or whether the size of the verdict so shocks the sense of justice as to compel the conclusion that the jury [was] influenced by partiality, prejudice, mistake or corruption. ... The court's broad power to order a remittitur should be exercised only when it is manifest that the jury [has] included items of damage which are contrary to law, not supported by proof, or contrary to the court's explicit and unchallenged instructions. ...\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-128\">\n    \"Furthermore, [t]he decision whether to reduce a jury verdict because it is excessive as a matter of law ... rests solely within the discretion of the trial court. ... [Consequently], the proper standard of review of a trial court's decision to grant or deny a motion to set aside a verdict as excessive as a matter of law is that of abuse of discretion. ... Accordingly, the ruling of the trial court on the motion to set aside the verdict as excessive is entitled to great weight and every reasonable presumption should be given in favor of its correctness.\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n    <em>\n     Patino\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Birken Mfg.

At trial, the plaintiff described the three separate incidents of sexual abuse he suffered when he was about ten or eleven years old at the hands of Hepp during camping trips, including exposure to pornography, sodomy, and fellatio. The plaintiff testified that, following the third incident, which involved Hepp performing anal sex on him, he stopped participating in scouting activities. The plaintiff further explained that these incidents made him feel \"ashamed\" and \"degraded\" and that, as a result, he chose not to share his experience with anyone until recently and continues to experience great difficulty recounting these events. He testified that these incidents have adversely affected his relationships with others, including receiving physical affection from his mother. He further testified that he is currently receiving psychological treatment and that the psychological injury he suffered has manifested itself in acts of self-harm and drug abuse.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-130\">\n    In addition, the plaintiff called Jeffrey Deitz, a psychiatrist, who provided expert testimony about the continued effects of sexual abuse on the plaintiff, including the increased likelihood that victims of childhood sexual abuse, like the plaintiff, will turn to substance abuse as a form of self-medication\n    <footnotemark>\n     8\n    </footnotemark>\n    and the fact that a history of such abuse often leads to the disruption of the victims' relationships with their loved ones. Deitz explained that he had met with the plaintiff on two occasions to evaluate him and determine whether the sexual abuse the plaintiff endured as a child during scouting activities had a continued effect on him. Deitz opined that it was \"excruciatingly difficult\" for the plaintiff to speak about the incidents of abuse and that\n    \"the entire interview was riddled with anxiety.\"\n    <footnotemark>\n     9\n    </footnotemark>\n    Deitz stated that the plaintiff's reaction during their meeting indicated\n    the considerable degree of distress he was still experiencing as a result of the abuse. Deitz concluded that the abuse the plaintiff suffered adversely affected multiple aspects of his development, including \"normal adolescent development.\" Deitz further concluded that the plaintiff's difficulty being intimate, his inability to have physical contact with his mother,\n    <footnotemark>\n     10\n    </footnotemark>\n    and his aversion to taking direction from authority figures could be attributed to past sexual abuse. Deitz then testified that the plaintiff had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and that there is a well established link between the development of bipolar disorder and childhood sexual abuse. Finally, Deitz opined, to a reasonable degree of medical probability, that the plaintiff's battle with suicidal ideation\n    <footnotemark>\n     11\n    </footnotemark>\n    was substantially caused by the sexual abuse he endured during scouting activities and that he could benefit from psychological therapy.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-131\">\n    Furthermore, I disagree with the defendant's contention that the jury's damages award for negligent infliction of emotional distress is duplicative of their award for the plaintiff's general negligence claim.\n    <footnotemark>\n     12\n    </footnotemark>\n    I am persuaded that the plaintiff's general negligence\n    claim sets forth a claim for relief separate and apart from the plaintiff's negligent infliction of emotional distress claim.\n    <footnotemark>\n     13\n    </footnotemark>\n    The jury reasonably could have found that the plaintiff had also sustained a physical injury as a result of the incidents of sexual abuse. It was within the jury's common knowledge that acts of sexual abuse involve a considerable physical injury to a minor child.

Thus, in my view, it is reasonable to believe that the jury's award for the general negligence claim reflects their view of\n    fair compensation for the actual physical intrusion itself and, therefore, does not constitute duplicative recovery.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-132\">\n    Construing the evidence in the light most favorable to sustaining the verdict, I would conclude that the record at trial was sufficient to support the jury's compensatory damages award.

The justices in the majority opinion and the other concurrence and dissent, however, have reached divergent conclusions about the correct disposition of the case. Chief Justice Rogers and Judge Sheldon, who comprise the majority opinion, would reverse the trial court's judgment and remand the case for a new trial. Justices Eveleigh and McDonald, who comprise the other concurrence and dissent, would affirm the trial court's judgment. If we were to adhere to our respective positions, there would be no controlling judgment from this court. In these circumstances, and given that a majority of the justices of the court have disagreed with the position that Justice Espinosa, Justice Robinson and I have taken with respect to the statute of limitations issue, we have considered the merits of the defendant's instructional error claim and agree with and join part I of the majority opinion. We therefore agree that the judgment of the trial court must be reversed and the case remanded for a new trial.\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"6\">\n    <p id=\"p-176\">\n     Two Superior Court cases addressed this issue before\n     <em>\n      Almonte\n     </em>\n     was decided in 1994.\n     <em>\n      See\n     </em>\n     v.\n     <em>\n      Bridgeport Roman Catholic Diocesan Corp\n     </em>\n     ., supra,\n     <extracted-citation index=\"216\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20Conn.%20L.%20Rptr.%2051\">\n      10 Conn.L.Rptr. at 51\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (indicating that \u00a7 52-577d applies to perpetrators and nonperpetrators);\n     <em>\n      Ashlaw\n     </em>\n     v\n     <em>\n      .

Specifically, the majority states that my reliance on the language of the trial court's jury instruction on superseding cause is misplaced because the defendant requested a jury instruction on the element of duty, rather than an instruction on causation. See footnote 10 of the majority opinion. I disagree.\n    </p>\n    <p id=\"p-184\">\n     First, I note that it was the defendant who requested a jury instruction on the special defense of superseding cause and that such an instruction, because it relates to a special defense, is favorable to the defendant. Second, as the majority recognizes, when reviewing a challenge to the trial court's jury instruction, this court must \"examine the [trial] court's\n     <em>\n      entire\n     </em>\n     charge to determine whether it is reasonably possible that the jury could have been misled by the omission of the requested instruction.\" (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n     <em>\n      State\n     </em>\n     v.\n     <em>\n      Devalda\n     </em>\n     , supra,\n     <extracted-citation index=\"229\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=306%20Conn.%20494\">\n      306 Conn. at 505-506\n     </extracted-citation>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation index=\"230\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20A.3d%20882\">\n      50 A.3d 882\n     </extracted-citation>\n     . Furthermore, as previously stated herein, this court has specifically stated that \"[i]n determining whether an instructional impropriety was harmless, we consider ... the effect of other instructions ....\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n     <em>\n      Allison\n     </em>\n     v.\n     <em>\n      Manetta\n     </em>\n     , supra, 284 Conn. at 400,\n     <extracted-citation index=\"231\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=933%20A.2d%201197\">\n      933 A.2d 1197\n     </extracted-citation>\n     . Finally, there is significant overlap between the elements of duty and causation.

Like an analysis of causation, a determination of the nature of the legal duty owed, if any, must be rooted in the fundamental policy of the law that a tortfeasor's responsibility should not extend to the theoretically endless consequences of the wrong.\" [Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.] ), cert. denied,\n     <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3956690,3957206\" index=\"236\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/284/907/\">\n      284 Conn. 907\n     </extracted-citation>\n     ,\n     <extracted-citation index=\"237\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=931%20A.2d%20262\">\n      931 A.2d 262\n     </extracted-citation>\n     (2007). Indeed, the majority, in addressing the defendant's claim that the plaintiff did not present sufficient evidence to support a finding that the defendant's conduct caused the plaintiff's damages, acknowledges this overlap and the fact that the analysis of one factor can be applicable to the other. Specifically, the majority fails to conduct an independent analysis of the defendant's claim relating to causation and, instead, explains that its conclusion \"that the plaintiff has made out a prima facie case that the defendant's negligent conduct increased the risk that the plaintiff would be subject to sexual abuse and that the defendant negligently failed to take precautions against this risk ... is sufficient to establish causation.\"\n    </p>\n   </footnote>\n   <footnote label=\"7\">\n    <p id=\"p-185\">\n     On appeal, the defendant makes the related claim that \"[t]here was no evidence at trial that the risk of molestation in [its program] was any higher than it was in the general public.
