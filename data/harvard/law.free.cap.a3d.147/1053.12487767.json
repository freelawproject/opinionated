We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The jury reasonably could have found the following facts after the conclusion of the evidence. The victim was born in 1997; the defendant was born in 1984. In 2004, the victim's mother met and began dating the defendant. He eventually moved in with the victim's mother, and they lived together at various addresses between then and 2010. Initially, the victim got along well with the defendant, but, beginning in 2007, he began touching the victim inappropriately. One day, in the kitchen of\n   the apartment where they were then living, he grabbed the victim's buttocks. The victim told\n   her mother about the incident, and her mother asked the defendant if this was true. The defendant denied it, and the victim's mother did not pursue the matter further. The defendant confronted the victim once she was alone in her room and angrily demanded to know why she was lying to her mother. Although the victim knew that what the defendant had done was wrong, she felt as if her mother did not believe her, and so she later told her mother that maybe she had \"take[n] it the wrong way.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The family moved to a new apartment at the end of 2008. A few months after the move, the defendant resumed touching the victim inappropriately. The abuse escalated, with the defendant touching the victim's buttocks, breasts, and vagina. He forced the victim to touch his penis, on one occasion ejaculating on her hand. He told the victim that one day he was going to rape her. At the time, the victim was eleven years old.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The victim began cutting her legs with her fingernails and taking pills to cope with the abuse. She grew sullen and would lash out at people. Although the victim had a good relationship with her mother, she did not discuss the abuse with her mother because her mother had not believed her the first time, and she did not think her mother would believe her the second time. Eventually, in November, 2009, the victim-then twelve years old-told her boyfriend that the defendant was touching her. Her boyfriend told his mother, who did not do anything. Her boyfriend also stopped asking the defendant for rides home when he visited the victim, so that the victim would not have to be alone with the defendant on the ride back.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   Finally, in January, 2010, the victim told her grandmother about the defendant touching her. She had called her grandmother because she was angry at the defendant for taking a space heater out of her room during the winter while the apartment's heating system\n   was broken. She testified that at the time she was frustrated and angry, and had been holding those emotions inside for almost one year. During the phone call to her grandmother, \"[i]t just all came out,\" and she told her grandmother about how the defendant had been touching her. The grandmother drove over and picked the victim up the next day, and the victim's cousin had her write down in a notebook what the defendant had done to her. The grandmother then called the victim's mother over to talk about it with several other family members and friends there for support. They called the police. The defendant moved out that day. He was later arrested and charged with one count of attempt to commit sexual assault in the first degree, as well as multiple counts of sexual assault in the fourth degree and risk of injury to a child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   A jury found the defendant guilty of two counts of sexual assault in the fourth degree and two counts of risk of injury to a child. The jury found him not guilty of one count of attempted sexual assault in the first degree, one count of sexual assault in the fourth degree, and one count of risk of injury to a child. The court imposed a sentence of fifteen years incarceration, suspended after ten years of mandatory minimum time,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   with ten years of probation. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The defendant's first claim is that the court violated his rights under the sixth amendment to confront the witnesses against him and to present a defense when, pursuant to the rape shield statute, \u00a7 54-86f, it excluded evidence of the sexual nature of the victim's prior relationship with her boyfriend. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Before trial, the state moved to exclude any evidence of the victim's prior sexual conduct, pursuant to \u00a7 54-86f.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant, however, moved to admit evidence that the victim was having sex with her boyfriend before she brought sexual abuse allegations against the defendant, on the ground that such evidence was admissible under the fourth exception to \u00a7 54-86f because it was \"otherwise so relevant and material to a critical issue in the case that excluding it would violate the defendant's constitutional rights....\" General Statutes \u00a7 54-86f(4).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   When the court decided these two motions in limine at a pretrial hearing, the court had before it only the factual representations and arguments made by the parties at that hearing. As for the defendant, defense counsel represented the following to the court at that hearing. Shortly before the victim's sexual abuse allegations, the defendant had found a series of letters that the victim's boyfriend had written to her. In the letters, the victim's boyfriend talked about losing his virginity with the victim, her concern that she might be pregnant,\n   and their desire to be together forever. When the defendant found the letters, he confronted the victim and spoke with her mother. As a result, the victim was grounded and forbidden from seeing her boyfriend again, which ultimately led to their separation. Defense counsel further represented that the victim's relationship with the defendant deteriorated after her grounding, with the two arguing often, until one month later when she called her grandmother and falsely accused the defendant of sexual abuse so that the Department of Children and Families would remove him from the home. Defense counsel submitted the letters at issue to the court after the hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The defense argued that evidence of the sexual nature of the victim's relationship with her boyfriend was material on two distinct grounds: (1) to rebut an inference that the victim's allegations must be true because a child her age otherwise would lack the sexual knowledge necessary to make up the allegations; and (2) to show that the victim had a strong motive to falsely accuse the defendant as retaliation\n   against him for ending her sexual relationship with her boyfriend.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   As to the sexual knowledge ground, the defense argued that, if the state submitted evidence conforming to its allegations that the victim accused the defendant of making her \"hold his penis and go up and down on his penis,\" until the point of \"ejaculation,\" and of asking her, \"are you going to suck my penis,\" then the jury would naturally question where the victim learned how sex works such that she would be able to make allegations accurately describing sexual mechanics. The defense argued that, because the victim was only twelve years old when she first reported the defendant's sexual abuse, a jury would naturally presume that she had no ordinary sources of sexual knowledge, and so the only way she would know enough to describe sex was if she had learned about it from the defendant's sexual abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The defense argued that evidence of an alternative source of sexual knowledge-i.e., the victim's sexual relationship with her boyfriend-was necessary to rebut that presumption.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As to the motive ground, the defense argued that, in presenting the jury with the defense theory that the victim accused the defendant of sexually abusing her in retaliation for his grounding her and ending her relationship with her boyfriend, the sexual nature of that relationship was relevant to the \"emotional state of the parties\" and explained why the victim became \"so angry her emotions rose to the point\" of falsely accusing the defendant of sexual abuse.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The state opposed the defendant's motion, arguing that (1) a jury would not presume that someone the victim's age was sexually nave, especially given that \"[c]hildren at an early age are taught ... what's a good touch and what's a bad touch,\" so there was no need to rebut such a presumption with evidence of an alternative source of sexual knowledge, and (2) the defendant could submit evidence that he punished the victim and ended her relationship with her boyfriend shortly before she made the allegations against him, suggesting a possible motive, but whether the victim was having sex with her boyfriend was immaterial. The state did not dispute that the letters showed that the victim and her boyfriend were sexually active.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The court granted the state's motion to exclude the evidence and denied the defendant's motions to admit it. The court ruled that the defendant could \"say there was an issue, it was a very substantial issue, you know, that I'm going to allow, but not the specifics of what it was. You can't go there.\" When the defendant asked for further clarity the next day, the court replied: \"Let me see if I can make this absolutely clear. There is to be no questioning, no inquiry based on my ruling\n   yesterday with respect to any relationship-specific relationship between [the boyfriend] and the [victim]. I want that to be absolutely clearly understood, and-is that clear?. Is there any-any question about that area? Because if there is, I'd like to hear it now....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   \"You can't go into any area where an inference of a sexual relationship between [the boyfriend] and the [victim] could be inferred by the jury. I'm cautioning you, don't go there.... If you want to say there were letters ... and the content of those letters caused an argument, that's fine, but nothing about what the content is.... I don't know how much clearer I can make this.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We begin with the standard of review. \"This court has consistently recognized that it will set aside an evidentiary\n   ruling only when there has been a clear abuse of discretion.... The trial court has wide discretion in determining the relevancy of evidence and the scope of cross-examination and [e]very reasonable presumption should be made in favor of the correctness of the court's ruling in determining whether there has been an abuse of discretion....\n   <em>\n    State v.

Generally, a trial court abuses its discretion when the court could have chosen different alternatives but has decided the matter so arbitrarily as to vitiate logic, or has decided it based on improper or irrelevant factors....\n   <em>\n    State v.

When this court reviews a decision of the trial court for abuse of discretion, the question is not whether any one of us, had we been sitting as the trial judge, would have exercised our discretion differently.... Rather, our inquiry is limited to whether the trial court's ruling was arbitrary or unreasonable....\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Cancel\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3149907\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/275/1/#p18\">\n    275 Conn. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 18,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=878%20A.2d%201103\">\n    878 A.2d 1103\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005).

The classic distinction between materiality and relevance is that (1) materiality pertains to whether the evidence tends to prove a\n   <em>\n    fact\n   </em>\n   that\n   <em>\n    bears on an element of or defense to\n   </em>\n   the action, and (2) relevance pertains to whether the\n   <em>\n    evidence\n   </em>\n   actually\n   <em>\n    tends to prove\n   </em>\n   that fact. See Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 4-1, commentary; C. Tait &amp; E. Prescott, Connecticut Evidence (5th Ed. 2014) \u00a7\u00a7 4.1 through 4.1.4, pp. 153-55. In a strict sense, then, evidence is relevant to facts, and facts are material to legal elements. See Conn. Code Evid. \u00a7 4-1, commentary. In a more general sense, evidence is \"material\" if it is offered to prove facts that are themselves material, either directly or indirectly, to a legal element. See\n   <em>\n    State v. Wright\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"21\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=320%20Conn.%20781\">\n    320 Conn. at 810\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"22\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=135%20A.3d%201\">\n    135 A.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; C. Tait &amp; E. Prescott, supra, \u00a7 4.1.3, p. 154.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   Here, the defendant offered two theories as to why the evidence was material. First, he argued that the sexual nature of the victim's relationship with her boyfriend would rebut an inference that the defendant must have sexually abused the victim because a child her age otherwise would lack the sexual knowledge necessary to make such allegations, and, thus, was material to whether the defendant sexually abused the victim. Second, he argued that the sexual nature of the victim's relationship with her boyfriend gave her a stronger motive to falsely accuse the defendant as payback for his role in ending it, which was material to whether her allegations of sexual abuse were true. We address each theory in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   As to the sexual knowledge theory of materiality, the defendant argues that the sexual nature of the victim's relationship with her boyfriend was material to whether the defendant sexually abused the victim, insofar as it\n   rebutted an inference that he must have sexually abused her because otherwise a child of the victim's age presumably would lack the sexual knowledge necessary to fabricate such allegations. This theory of materiality is essentially defensive and responds to the presumption that a child of the victim's age would have no source of sexual knowledge other than the abuse alleged. The seminal case on this issue is\n   <em>\n    State v. Rolon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"963519\" index=\"23\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/257/156/#p158\">\n    257 Conn. 156\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 158-59, 167 n. 19,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=777%20A.2d%20604\">\n    777 A.2d 604\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001), in which a trial court excluded evidence that a different relative had sexually abused a six year old victim before the victim disclosed that the defendant abused her, and our Supreme Court held that this violated the defendant's constitutional rights. According to the court, the six year old victim in\n   <em>\n    Rolon\n   </em>\n   exhibited sexualized \"behavior indicative of sexual abuse\" and \"highly age-inappropriate sexual knowledge,\" which a jury would \"inevitably conclude ...

According to the defendant, the victim's motive was her desire to get back\n   at him for ending her relationship with her boyfriend, so the closeness of that relationship would affect the strength of\n   her motive, and the strength of her motive would affect the credibility of her allegations.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   Because the victim was a fact witness to the acts of sexual abuse alleged, her credibility was material to whether the defendant in fact \"subject[ed] [the victim] to sexual contact\" or \"ha[d] contact with the intimate parts [of the victim] ... in a sexual and indecent manner likely to impair the health or morals of such child,\" which were required elements of the crimes charged. See General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-73a(a)(1)(A) and 53-21(a)(2). Thus, to the extent that the defendant offered evidence of the sexual nature of the victim's relationship with her boyfriend to prove that she had a strong motive to falsely accuse the defendant as retaliation for ending that relationship, the evidence was material for purposes of the rape shield statute.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   2\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   We next conclude that the proffered evidence was relevant. \"Relevant evidence is evidence that has a logical tendency to aid the trier in the determination of an issue....

On this record, we cannot conclude\n   that the exclusion of the sexual conduct evidence violated the defendant's sixth amendment rights. See\n   <em>\n    State v.

By contrast, the state argues that the court did not abuse its discretion in seating D.W. because D.W. said that he would follow the court's instructions and that he would put his past experience aside when considering the evidence against the defendant.\n   The following additional facts and procedural history are relevant to this claim. After six regular jurors and three alternates had been selected, but before trial began, the court informed the parties that they had lost two jurors. One of the alternate jurors was excused with a doctor's note due to back issues, and one of the regular jurors was unable to attend because his child had caught pneumonia. Accordingly, the court decided to select one additional alternate before trial began and then to select, from the three alternates, the replacement sixth regular juror.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-62\">\n   Because the state and the defendant already had exercised all eight of their peremptory challenges, the court gave them each one extra peremptory challenge for this final round of jury selection. The defendant exercised his peremptory challenge on the first prospective juror interviewed. The second prospective juror interviewed was D.W. During voir dire, D.W. said that he was a welder from Naugatuck who lived with his fianc\u00e9e and their two year old daughter. He had the following exchange with the prosecutor:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-63\">\n   \"Q. There may be some testimony from a child or a teenager in this case.

Yeah. So, if you were chosen as a juror and you had a person-you had a child on the one hand, somebody under fifteen, and somebody who is an adult and they have contradictory stories, would you tend to believe the child over the adult?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-125\">\n   \"A.

I would want to understand what's going on before I make that decision, yeah.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-128\">\n   Finally, the court asked D.W. several questions on the same topic:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-129\">\n   \"[Q.] Okay. Probably the most important rule is that the jury evaluates all the witnesses, and it's required without exception to treat all those witnesses equally. It doesn't matter their gender, it doesn't matter their age, it doesn't matter what their title is, it doesn't matter if they're police officers, it doesn't matter if they're-it doesn't matter.

So, the question is: Can you follow that rule?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-130\">\n   \"[A.] Yes, sir.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-131\">\n   \"[Q.] Okay. Now, we talked about-answered that. Just let me check my notes here. Give me a second. So, again, let me just give you an analogy, just-just to-I don't want to belabor this, but it's a real important point. The process here, you have to think of as a blank canvas. You're an artist, so the canvas is blank.

So, can you-can you do that?\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-136\">\n   \"[A.] Yes, sir.\"\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   When the juror left the room, the state said that it found D.W. acceptable. Defense counsel challenged him for cause, arguing that D.W. had said that he had personal experience believing a child abuse victim and that he thought children more credible. The court denied the challenge for cause, noting that D.W. ultimately said that he would have to evaluate children's credibility\n   on an individual basis.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court seated D.W. as an alternate, the\n   clerk randomly chose D.W. from the three alternates to be a regular juror, and D.W. was elected to be the jury foreperson at the end of trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   We begin with the standard of review. \"The constitutional standard of fairness requires that a defendant have a panel of impartial, indifferent jurors.... We agree with the defendant that the enactment of article first, \u00a7 19, of the Connecticut constitution, as amended, reflects the abiding belief of our citizenry that an impartial and fairly chosen jury is the cornerstone of our criminal justice system....

The defendant argues that D.W. could not be fair and impartial for three reasons: (1) D.W. believed that children were less likely to lie\n   than adults; (2) he had personal experience believing a child abuse victim; and (3) he publicly opined on the central issue of the case during voir dire.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-141\">\n   As to the first reason, which is D.W.'s tendency to believe children, although D.W. did say that children generally tell the truth, he also noted that \"some kids don't tell the truth, some kids do,\" and that if a teenager and an adult both testified in a case, he would\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   necessarily believe the teenager over the adult. Rather, D.W. said that he would evaluate the witnesses' credibility individually, on the basis of their demeanor. He reiterated that position when defense counsel questioned him on it. When the court instructed D.W. that \"it doesn't matter their age ... [y]ou've got to treat every single witness by the same standard,\" and asked D.W. if he would follow that rule, he replied that he would.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-142\">\n   As to the second reason, which is D.W.'s prior experience, although D.W. did say that, eight years ago, his former girlfriend's daughter told him that a neighbor was \"doing things that were out of the ordinary\" and that the neighbor was \"not there anymore because they did something wrong.\" D.W. was also adamant that \"everybody gets a fair chance\" and that he would \"have to hear both sides to understand what's going on\" in the defendant's case. When the court explained that D.W. could consider only the testimony and exhibits at trial, not any outside experiences,\n   D.W. said that he understood and would treat his prior experience as\n   though \"[i]t doesn't exist.\" When the court asked D.W. if he could limit his deliberations to the evidence presented at trial, D.W. replied that he would.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-143\">\n   As to the third reason, for the reasons previously discussed, we disagree that D.W. expressed \"a fixed and settled opinion\";\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Tucker\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"738676\" index=\"73\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/226/618/#p630\">\n    226 Conn. at 630\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"74\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=629%20A.2d%201067\">\n    629 A.2d 1067\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; on the central issue of the case, i.e., the victim's credibility versus that of the defendant. To the contrary, D.W. repeatedly said that he would have to hear the evidence and evaluate witnesses on an individual basis.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-144\">\n   In sum, after some initial confusion, D.W. told both attorneys and the court that he would not believe child witnesses merely on the basis of their age; that he would put aside his prior experiences; and that he would need to judge each witness individually. We conclude that the court reasonably could have determined that D.W. would be impartial, and so the court did not abuse its discretion when it denied the defendant's challenge for cause.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-151\">\n    The jury found the defendant not guilty of three other charges: (1) a third charge of sexual assault in the fourth degree; (2) a third charge of risk of injury to a child; and (3) a charge of attempt to commit sexual assault in the first degree in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 53a-49(a)(2) and 53a-70(a)(2).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-152\">\n    General Statutes \u00a7 53-21(a) provides in relevant part: \"Any person who ...
