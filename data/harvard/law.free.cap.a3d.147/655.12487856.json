The defendant claims that the Appellate Court incorrectly determined that he waived his unpreserved jury instruction claim under the rule established in\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4343690\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/299/447/#p482\">\n    299 Conn. 447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 482-83,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20A.3d%20942\">\n    10 A.3d 942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011).\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   The\n   defendant further contends that the rule in\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   should be overturned because it is confusing, unworkable, interferes with an appellate court's discretion to review unpreserved claims and does not serve the interests of justice.\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   We conclude, following a careful review of the record, that the Appellate Court correctly determined that the defendant waived his unpreserved jury instruction claim. We also conclude that the rule in\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   should not be overturned. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   We begin with the defendant's waiver claim. The defendant contends that the trial court's instruction on identification witnesses was deficient because it did not inform the jury that the certainty of a witness' identification does not mean that the identification is accurate, or that factors such as distance, lighting, a witness' emotional state and the time between the crime and the witness identification are also relevant in considering the accuracy of an identification. The state responds that defense counsel indicated that he understood and accepted the trial court's proposed instruction, and, therefore, the defendant's\n   claim is unreviewable under the waiver rule in\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   . We agree with the state that the defendant's claim is unreviewable.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   The following facts and procedural history are relevant to our resolution of this claim. On Thursday, November 4, 2010, two days after commencement of the evidentiary portion of the trial, the court gave counsel a draft of the proposed jury instructions. The court also notified counsel that, if they would like to make any additional changes to the instructions, they should inform the court by the following Monday, November 8, although counsel were free to file supplemental instruction requests after that time in light of additional evidence. The court added: \"If there's anything either in the court's language or an additional area that I would call nonstandard that you want included, please let the court know.\" The court also stated that it expected jury deliberations to begin on Tuesday, November 9. The proposed instructions do not appear to have been marked for identification or otherwise made part of the record.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   On Monday, November 8, following conclusion of the evidence, the trial court stated for the record that it was going to meet with counsel in chambers for \"a legal charging conference.\" The court explained: \"[I]t's the actual law the court is going to give tomorrow as it relates to the charges themselves and any kind of law that would apply to this case based on identification witnesses, inconsistent testimony, etc., charges that need to go to the jury in order to complete the record of the case.\" The court added that it would try to incorporate any specific requests by counsel into the proposed charge. The court also indicated that it had given counsel copies of the court's proposed general and specific instructions. A brief recess followed, during which the court consulted with counsel in chambers.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   After the recess, the court described the proceeding to follow as \"our legal session for the charging conference.\" The court first observed that it had given counsel for both sides copies of the proposed general instructions. It then described certain changes unrelated to the identification issue that it intended to make in response to requests by counsel, adding that it also intended to change the instructions to read that it was the state's burden to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had committed the charged crimes, to which defense counsel specifically assented. The court next discussed the proposed identification instruction, explaining: \"With respect to identification, I did give an identification section in the charge which outlines on page 14 that the jur[ors] must be satisfied in making the identification, including some of the factors they can consider in this evidence. However, I'm going to expand that language to include ... language to the effect that, in every criminal prosecution, it is the state's responsibility to show that the defendant is the person who committed the offense, and if they are not satisfied of that evidence,\n   then they cannot find the defendant guilty of any particular offense. I'm going to highlight that because, obviously, that is an issue in this case.\" The court also indicated its willingness to change language in the proposed instructions referring to the possession of a weapon, as suggested by defense counsel. After the court asked if there were any other exceptions, defense counsel responded: \"Not at this time, Your Honor.\" The court replied: \"Okay, I appreciate your coming back up, and, with that, because the charge is now complete, we can go right to the jury .... Okay?\" Defense counsel simply responded: \"Thank you, Your Honor.\" The court then adjourned for the day.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   When the proceeding resumed the next morning, the court initially noted that it had conducted an on-the-record charging conference the previous day, during\n   which it had made certain changes to the jury instructions suggested by counsel. The court also clarified that the jury instructions would contain no reference to lesser included offenses, and both counsel agreed that this was appropriate. After the court asked if there was \"[a]nything else\" of concern the parties wanted to discuss before the jury was brought into the courtroom, counsel responded: \"Nothing from [the] defense, Your Honor.\" The jury then returned to the courtroom, and the court delivered its instructions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The trial court's jury instructions addressed the issue of identification two different times. The court first addressed the identification issue indirectly when it instructed the jury regarding how to decide whether to believe a witness' testimony.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   It later addressed the issue directly in its charge on identification.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   Defense\n   counsel took no exception to either instruction. Defense counsel instead stated that he did not object to the instructions, agreed with the state regarding a clarification relating to the elements in the weapons counts, and asked the court to eliminate the instruction on proof of the felony conviction. The court agreed to the suggested changes and asked if there was anything else defense counsel wanted to\n   discuss, to which counsel replied in the negative.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The defendant was convicted on all counts. On January 7, 2011, the court held a sentencing hearing. At the hearing, defense counsel initially argued in support of three postverdict motions the defendant had filed to arrest judgment, for judgment of acquittal, and for a new trial. In his argument, counsel stated that all three motions were based principally on the allegedly rapid speed with which the jury instructions had been delivered. Counsel specifically argued: \"[I]t's not the content of the jury instructions. The jury instruction says we went through the charging conference. We conferred. We agreed on them. I didn't take any exceptions. The issue I had, Your Honor, was the speed with [which] the court went through the instructions to the jury.\" Counsel indicated that the speed of the instructions was important because it affected the jurors' ability to follow them. The court denied all three motions, reasoning that \"the jur[ors] did have the benefit of the actual transcript of the court's instructions going in with them in their deliberative process.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Thereafter, the defendant appealed from the judgment of conviction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant claimed, among other things, that \"the [jury] instructions on the issue of [the accuracy of an] identification were prejudicially\n   erroneous and deprived him of [his constitutional right to] a fair trial ....\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bellamy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12415016\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/149/665/#p669\">\n    149 Conn.App. 665\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 669,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=89%20A.3d%20927\">\n    89 A.3d 927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014). The defendant specifically contended that the instructions departed from the standard criminal jury instructions promulgated by the Judicial Branch because they failed to inform the jury that the certainty of a witness' identification does not equate with its accuracy.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=89%20A.3d%20927\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   He also contended that the instructions had failed to list other relevant factors relating to the accuracy of a witness identification, such as distance, lighting, the emotional state of the witness, and the time between the crime and the identification.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=89%20A.3d%20927\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   The defendant, who apparently had filed no request to charge, conceded that this claim was unpreserved and sought review under\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"566558\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/213/233/#p239\">\n    213 Conn. 233\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 239-40,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=567%20A.2d%20823\">\n    567 A.2d 823\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989).\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bellamy\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 671,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=89%20A.3d%20927\">\n    89 A.3d 927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The Appellate Court noted, however, that a claim that has been waived at trial fails to satisfy the third prong of\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   .\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Id., at 671-72,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=89%20A.3d%20927\">\n    89 A.3d 927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court thus determined that, in order to decide whether\n   the defendant's claim was reviewable under\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   , it was required, under\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   , to first consider whether the claim had\n   been waived at trial.\n   <extracted-citation index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=89%20A.3d%20927\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Applying the waiver rule in\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   , the court ultimately concluded that the claim had been waived. Id., at 673-74,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=89%20A.3d%20927\">\n    89 A.3d 927\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court summarized: \"[D]efense counsel, having been provided with a draft copy of the jury instructions and a meaningful opportunity to review them and to alert the court to any potential issues, declined to object in any way to the portion concerning identification, and affirmatively expressed his satisfaction with the content of the instructions. Under these circumstances, the defendant has waived his claim of instructional error, and, accordingly, it fails under the third prong of\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   .\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"12\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=89%20A.3d%20927\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; see also footnote 3 of this opinion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   On appeal to this court, the defendant contends that the Appellate Court incorrectly concluded that he waived his claim of instructional error. We disagree. In\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   , we stated: \"[W]hen the trial court provides counsel with a copy of the proposed jury instructions, allows a meaningful opportunity for their review, solicits comments from counsel regarding changes or modifications and counsel affirmatively accepts the instructions proposed or given, the defendant may be deemed to have knowledge of any potential flaws therein and to have waived implicitly the constitutional right to challenge the instructions on direct appeal. Such a determination by the reviewing court must be based on a close examination of the record and the particular facts and circumstances of each case.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4343690\" index=\"13\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/299/447/#p482\">\n    299 Conn. at 482-83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20A.3d%20942\">\n    10 A.3d 942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In the present case, all of the foregoing criteria were satisfied. The trial court gave both defense counsel and the state a copy of its proposed jury instructions four days before the charging conference. Two of the four days fell on a weekend, thus providing counsel with even more time to review the instructions. The court also solicited comments from counsel regarding modifications to the instructions during the in-chambers charging conference, during the proceedings in open court directly after the charging conference and on the following day immediately before instructing the jury. In addition, when the court discussed portions of the identification instruction on the record, defense counsel expressed no dissatisfaction with the instruction, although he commented on several other instructions. Counsel thus indicated that he had read and understood the instructions in their entirety and took no issue with any part, including the instruction on identification. Finally, defense counsel explicitly conceded during the sentencing hearing that he had agreed with the substance of the jury instructions before\n   they were given and that his only objection was to the speed with which they had been delivered by the court. Accordingly, we conclude that the defendant implicitly waived his jury instruction claim under the rule articulated in\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Notwithstanding these compelling facts, the defendant claims that he did not agree to the trial court's identification instruction. He contends that, in the absence of a marked copy of the jury instructions, there is no evidence in the record that defense counsel reviewed and approved of the precise language of the identification instruction. He also notes that, although\n   the trial court stated during the on-the-record charging conference that it intended to broaden and expand on the language in the proposed instruction, there is no evidence that defense counsel had an opportunity to review and approve of the revised instruction before it was given. He thus argues that defense counsel's statement at the sentencing hearing that he agreed with the content of the jury instructions \"cannot be reconciled\" with the state's burden of establishing waiver by showing that counsel reviewed the precise language being challenged on appeal, especially in light of counsel's claim at the hearing regarding the speedy delivery of the instructions. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   We first observe that the waiver rule in\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   does not require that a copy of the proposed jury instructions be marked as an exhibit. It only requires evidence that the trial court gave the parties a \"copy of the proposed jury instructions\" and that the reviewing court's determination of implied waiver \"be based on a close examination of the record and the particular facts and circumstances of each case.\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4343690\" index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/299/447/#p482\">\n    299 Conn. at 482-83\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20A.3d%20942\">\n    10 A.3d 942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thus, in most instances, a combination of facts and circumstances rather than any single fact will support a finding of waiver. Moreover, a marked copy would not necessarily have provided the desired clarity as to what defense counsel waived because courts often make last minute changes to the jury instructions in on-the-record consultations with counsel immediately prior to their delivery, when there may be no time to memorialize the changes in a written document. Finally, to the extent the defendant suggests that the lack of a marked copy in the present case prevented the reviewing court from knowing that the trial court's draft included an instruction on eyewitness identification, we know that the draft included such an instruction because the trial court referred to it during the on-the-record charging conference when it stated\n   that it \"did give an identification [instruction] in the charge,\" and the court even referred to the page containing the part of the instruction it wanted to amend. Accordingly, although a marked copy of the proposed jury instructions may be helpful in determining whether defense counsel assented to an instruction that is challenged on appeal, it is not a requirement under\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   if the record contains other persuasive evidence that defense counsel had knowledge of, and assented to, the instructions that were given.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   Second, insofar as the defendant claims that he had no notice of the content of the final charge on witness identification because the court stated that it intended to \"expand\" that instruction, the defendant takes the trial court's language out of context and ignores the explanation that followed. What the court actually stated was that it intended to expand the language on page 14 of the proposed instructions \"to include ... language to the effect that, in every criminal prosecution, it is the state's responsibility to show that the defendant is the person who committed the offense, and if [the jurors] are not satisfied of that\n   evidence, then they cannot find the defendant guilty of any particular offense. I'm going to highlight that because, obviously, that is an issue in this case.\" Accordingly, the trial court explained precisely how it intended to expand the language in the identification instruction and referred to the actual page on which the new language would be added. Furthermore, and as the Appellate Court noted, the only other change to the instructions even indirectly relating to witness identification was the court's addition of language instructing that the state had the burden to prove identity beyond a reasonable doubt;\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bellamy\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12415016\" index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/149/665/#p669\">\n    149 Conn. App. at\n   </extracted-citation>\n   672 n.3,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=93%20A.3d%20597\">\n    93 A.3d 597\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; which has no relevance to the defendant's claim on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   As for the defendant's suggestion that defense counsel indicated during the sentencing hearing that he had\n   trouble following the jury charge because of its speedy delivery, the record shows that counsel's reference to a speedy delivery at the hearing had nothing to do with his ability to understand, and thus object to, the instructions that were given. The record instead shows that counsel was referring to the\n   <em>\n    jurors'\n   </em>\n   possible inability to understand the instructions because of their speedy delivery. The defendant thus misconstrues counsel's argument at the sentencing hearing.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   Finally, the cases on which the defendant relies are inapposite because their facts are distinguishable from the facts in the present case.

He specifically contends that\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   created an irrebuttable and incorrect presumption that all defense counsel who have had a meaningful opportunity to review draft jury instructions have knowledge of any and all constitutional errors contained therein, and that, through inaction or a silent record, all counsel are deemed under\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   to have waived a client's constitutional right to proper jury instructions for tactical reasons.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   He further contends that this presumption is\n   unrealistic because competent counsel who is aware of constitutional error never would waive a client's right to proper jury instructions, and the better explanation for counsel's silence is \"[o]versight in the heat of battle,\" when time constraints do not allow for a lengthy review of the instructions. Accordingly, the defendant does not characterize counsel's silence or inaction with respect to an alleged instructional error as waiver, but as forfeiture, which federal courts define as \"the failure to make the timely assertion of a right\";\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Olano\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6237509\" index=\"31\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/507/725/#p733\">\n    507 U.S. 725\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 733,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6237509\" index=\"32\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/507/725/#p733\">\n    113 S.Ct. 1770\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6237509\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/507/725/#p733\">\n    123 L.Ed.2d 508\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1993) ; accord\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   , supra, 299 Conn. at 474,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20A.3d%20942\">\n    10 A.3d 942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; see also\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 475 n.20 ; and review under the plain error doctrine. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 475 n.20. The defendant adds that the\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   rule improperly circumvents the policy expressed in\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   that unpreserved constitutional error should be reviewed and improperly shifts the responsibility for ensuring that the jury instructions are correct from the trial court and the state, where it belongs, to the defense.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The state responds that the defendant misunderstands the meaning of the\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   waiver rule. The state argues that, when the trial court asks counsel to make an informed and binding judgment regarding whether to accept the jury instructions and counsel acquiesces, counsel waives the procedural right to object to the instructions on any of the multitude of possible grounds that counsel might presently be aware of or later perceive. Thus, \"procedural waiver of the opportunity to object, by a professional who knew what was at stake, foreclosed any number of possible challenges that counsel might or might not have considered.\" The state further argues that this understanding of waiver comports with Connecticut's uncontroverted waiver doctrine and that overturning the rule would invalidate an entire body of waiver jurisprudence in this jurisdiction. The state maintains that the waiver\n   rule in\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   is good policy because it gives parties an incentive to participate in the formulation of the jury instructions in a timely manner when errors can be corrected, thus promoting fair trials. We agree with the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   We begin by noting that this court adopted the waiver rule in\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   in order to clarify the law and to encourage the formation of accurate jury instructions\n   consistent with the principles of fundamental fairness and the finality of judgments. To accomplish these objectives, the court explained that implied waiver may be found only after the trial court provides counsel with a written copy of the proposed instructions, allows counsel a meaningful opportunity to review them and solicits counsel's comments regarding proposed changes or modifications.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   , supra, 299 Conn. at 482-83,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20A.3d%20942\">\n    10 A.3d 942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

See id., at 483-84,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20A.3d%20942\">\n    10 A.3d 942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . If the record contains evidence that any of these steps has been omitted, implied waiver may not be found. Thus, the rule \"would not allow waiver to be presumed from a silent record or from defense counsel's mere acquiescence in, or failure to object to, the jury instructions. A silent record, by definition, would not satisfy the [rule] because there would be no factual basis from which the court could infer a waiver, and mere acquiescence or failure to object, without more, would provide an insufficient basis for a finding of waiver because there would be no evidence from which the court could determine whether counsel had been given a meaningful opportunity to review, comment on and express satisfaction with the instructions, or whether counsel had, in fact, expressed such satisfaction before or after the instructions were given.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20A.3d%20942\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at 483 n.23,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20A.3d%20942\">\n    10 A.3d 942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We further explained that our rules of practice provide counsel with many opportunities to participate in the crafting of jury instructions, including the filing of a written request to charge and the request for an on-the-record charging conference. Id., at 488, 493-94,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20A.3d%20942\">\n    10 A.3d 942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, the waiver rule in\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   , which represents a synthesis of our precedent and our rules of practice, provides counsel with the means necessary to apprise the court of his views and to ensure the accuracy of the jury instructions. The rule also serves as notice to counsel of the responsibility to participate in formulating the jury instructions and of the potentially adverse consequences that may follow should counsel fail to act.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   In light of these considerations, we emphatically disagree with the notion that the implied waiver rule is fundamentally unfair because it is based on the presumption that counsel was aware of, and rejected as a matter of trial strategy, every conceivable challenge to the jury instructions. The rule is not unfair because, as the state correctly observed and we stated in\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   , what is waived is the procedural right to appeal any defect in the jury instructions. See id., at 483, 494,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20A.3d%20942\">\n    10 A.3d 942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

For example, in\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Holness\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3963229\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/289/535/#p543\">\n    289 Conn. 535\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 543-45,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=958%20A.2d%20754\">\n    958 A.2d 754\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008), we specifically rejected the defendant's argument that he did not knowingly and intelligently waive his jury instruction claim and concluded that the defendant had waived every potential constitutional claim relating to the trial court's limiting instruction on hearsay evidence when defense counsel, in the exercise of his professional judgment, accepted the limiting instruction as satisfactory, even\n   though counsel later argued he had been unaware that he could\n   have raised a claim that the defendant's rights were violated under\n   <em>\n    Crawford\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Washington\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"43\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/#p68\">\n    541 U.S. 36\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 68,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"44\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/#p68\">\n    124 S.Ct. 1354\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5873383\" index=\"45\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/541/36/#p68\">\n    158 L.Ed.2d 177\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004). We explained that the state was not required to establish that defense counsel was aware of a possible constitutional claim in the factual scenario presented, but, rather, the trial court was entitled to presume that, in our adversary system, counsel was familiar with the relevant constitutional principles and had acted competently in determining that the limiting instruction was adequate to safeguard the defendant's sixth amendment rights.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Holness\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 544,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"46\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=958%20A.2d%20754\">\n    958 A.2d 754\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We thus see no reason in the present case to depart from our precedent and from our general waiver doctrine by overturning the rule in\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   , which is based on the same rationale articulated in\n   <em>\n    Holness\n   </em>\n   and Connecticut's other prior waiver cases.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The defendant nonetheless takes issue with all four policy grounds on which the court in\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   relied in concluding that the waiver rule is justified, including (1) the presumption that counsel is competent, (2) the rules of practice that provide for counsel's participation in the crafting of instructions, (3) the rules of fairness that place responsibility with the trial court and counsel to ensure that the instructions are correct, and (4) the existence of habeas review as a potential safety net. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   , supra, 299 Conn. at 486-89,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"89\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20A.3d%20942\">\n    10 A.3d 942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We address each ground in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   First, to the extent the defendant contends that the\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   waiver rule presumes counsel is omniscient, rather than competent, and that the rule does not allow for consideration of possible distractions, fatigue, discouragement or simple ignorance, the defendant misunderstands the rule, the meaning of competent counsel and the ability of counsel to identify errors before the instructions are given. As we previously discussed in greater detail, waiver in the context of jury instruction\n   claims, jury trials, probable cause hearings, guilty pleas, and claims of ineffective assistance of counsel and double jeopardy does not contemplate knowledge by trial counsel or the defendant of every conceivable claim that might be raised on appeal. Trial counsel thus need not be omniscient under the waiver rule in\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   in order to provide a defendant with adequate representation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Insofar as the defendant also suggests that the rule will unfairly penalize defendants because of inadvertent mistakes by counsel resulting from fatigue, distractions or other factors relating to the rapid pace of a trial, competent counsel do not defer consideration of jury instructions until the last minute, thereby increasing the possibility of committing inadvertent mistakes. Counsel necessarily must consider what the state will be required to prove and how the jury should be instructed well before commencement of the trial proceedings in order to prepare a defense. Thereafter, our rules of practice provide counsel with multiple opportunities to participate in the formulation of proper jury instructions based on counsel's professional assessment of what the jury needs to know to decide the case fairly. Viewed in this light, the rule in\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   merely encourages counsel to utilize these opportunities, thus enhancing the probability that the instructions will be accurate. We therefore reject the defendant's claim that the waiver rule sets an unattainable standard that requires more than competent counsel. In fact, the opposite is true. As Justice Katz observed in her concurring opinion in\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   , a review of Connecticut cases decided between 2000 and 2010 indicates that \"the number of cases in which a defendant obtains reversal of his conviction on the basis of\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   review of instructional errors is negligible\"; id., at 523,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"90\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20A.3d%20942\">\n    10 A.3d 942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Katz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    J.\n   </em>\n   , concurring); thus demonstrating that, prior to\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   , counsel rarely made major mistakes when assenting to jury instructions\n   at trial and suggesting that this will continue to be the case. In sum, instead of unfairly burdening counsel or posing a difficult challenge, the waiver rule in\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   provides the court, the state and trial counsel with an additional procedural tool for ensuring that the instructions\n   are correct.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   The defendant next claims that, although the rules of practice provide for counsel's participation in the formulation of jury instructions, the degree of participation necessary for waiver to be found never has been clearly enunciated, thus creating confusion and no clear pattern among cases decided after\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   for future guidance. We disagree. The rules of practice, together with the waiver rule in\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   , provide exceptionally clear guidance as to how counsel may avoid waiver and successfully preserve a jury instruction claim. For example, the rules of practice provide that counsel may file a written request to charge; Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 42-16, 42-17 and 42-18 ; request an on-the-record charging conference; Practice Book \u00a7 42-19 ; obtain a summary of the substance of the proposed instructions at the close of evidence; Practice Book \u00a7 42-19 ; discuss modification of the instructions for purposes of correction or clarification; Practice Book \u00a7 42-24 ; and be given notice and the opportunity to make suggestions when the jury requests additional instructions following the start of deliberations. Practice Book \u00a7 42-27. The specificity of these rules suggests that counsel who fail to participate in formulating the jury instructions but have been given a meaningful opportunity to review them\n   are on official notice that, unless they have objected to a particular instruction or a portion thereof, they have waived all future jury instruction claims. The rules of practice therefore serve the twin goals of providing the jury with accurate instructions and protecting the courts from expending limited resources on the adjudication of collateral attacks on the verdict that otherwise might have been avoided.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   Finally, even if there may be no clear pattern among the cases decided following\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   , the lack of such a pattern is not because the rule itself has never been clearly enunciated; rather, it is because reviewing courts are required to determine whether the unique facts and circumstances in any given case support a finding of waiver. This is no different from the type of \"facts and circumstances\" analysis we conduct in other contexts;\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Davalloo\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"91\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=320%20Conn.%20123\">\n    320 Conn. 123\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 144 n.15,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"92\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=128%20A.3d%20492\">\n    128 A.3d 492\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016) (application of marital communications privilege \"necessarily depends on the facts and circumstances of a particular matter\"); see also\n   <em>\n    Trusz\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    UBS Realty Investors, LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"93\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=319%20Conn.%20175\">\n    319 Conn. 175\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 214 n.26,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"94\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=123%20A.3d%201212\">\n    123 A.3d 1212\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015) (future resolution of conflict between employee's and employer's free speech rights under General Statutes \u00a7 31-51q will be \"in light of the particular facts and circumstances then presented\" [internal quotation marks omitted] ); or from the \"totality of the circumstances\" test the court conducts when assessing the constitutionality of challenged out-of-court eyewitness identifications; (internal quotation marks omitted)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Marquez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5764830\" index=\"95\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/291/122/#p160\">\n    291 Conn. 122\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 160,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"96\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=967%20A.2d%2056\">\n    967 A.2d 56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"97\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=558%20U.S.%20895\">\n    558 U.S. 895\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"98\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=130%20S.%20Ct.%20237\">\n    130 S.Ct. 237\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=175%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20163\">\n    175 L.Ed.2d 163\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009) ; or the probable cause necessary for a warrantless arrest based on an informant's tip.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3960688\" index=\"100\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/286/427/#p437\">\n    286 Conn. 427\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 437,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"101\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=944%20A.2d%20297\">\n    944 A.2d 297\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"102\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=555%20U.S.%20883\">\n    555 U.S. 883\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"103\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=129%20S.%20Ct.%20236\">\n    129 S.Ct. 236\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"104\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=172%20L.%20Ed.%202d%20144\">\n    172 L.Ed.2d 144\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2008). Cases subject to these tests do not fall easily into predictable\n   patterns because the facts and circumstances in each case are necessarily unique.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant also claims that the rule in\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   unfairly places the entire burden on defendants because the defendant is the only party who suffers a penalty when a reviewing court finds waiver. He adds that the rule provides a disincentive for the state to identify and correct errors when it knows that a review of any potential error will be waived if it does not object to the instructions, thus allowing the state to enjoy all of\n   the benefits and suffer none of the risks of its trial strategy. The defendant further contends that the rule improperly and unfairly shifts a portion of the decision as to which unpreserved claims are adjudicated from the court to the state. These arguments are unpersuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   First, they ignore the significant fact that only a defendant is entitled to raise on appeal a claim that the jury instructions were incorrect. This means that, if the defendant is acquitted on the basis of instructions that misstate an element of the crime, the state may not appeal from the judgment on that ground but must accept the acquittal, even if the evidence may have been sufficient to establish the defendant's guilt under the proper instruction. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ledbetter\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1613423\" index=\"105\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/240/317/#p323\">\n    240 Conn. 317\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 323,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"106\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=692%20A.2d%20713\">\n    692 A.2d 713\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1997) (\"under most circumstances, the state may not appeal from a judgment of acquittal, even when that judgment may have been the result of a misconstruction of the law\"). Moreover, the state has an ethical obligation to seek justice and to bring to the court's attention any inaccuracy or deficiency in the jury instructions. The state thus has a strong incentive to make sure that the jury instructions are correct. Second, a finding of waiver opens the door to a future habeas proceeding on which the state and the court will be required to expend additional limited resources that could have been devoted to other pending trials.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   Third, trial courts have a duty \"to give jury instructions that are accurate in law, adapted to the issues and adequate to guide the jury in reaching a correct verdict\";\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Butler\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"537697\" index=\"107\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/207/619/#p636\">\n    207 Conn. 619\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 636,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"108\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=543%20A.2d%20270\">\n    543 A.2d 270\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1988) ; and no judge, as a matter of pride and reputation, wants a reviewing court to deem the\n   jury charge legally incorrect or inadequate to guide the jury. As a\n   consequence, the waiver rule serves as an incentive for all those involved in the trial proceedings, including the state and the presiding judge, to make certain that the jury instructions are accurate,\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   a conclusion with which the defendant indirectly agrees in his argument on judicial economy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   As for the defendant's argument that the\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   waiver rule allows the state to exercise undue influence over whether unpreserved constitutional claims are reviewed under\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   because the state may decide against making a waiver claim in some cases for tactical reasons, this argument is highly speculative. The defendant does not suggest what that tactical advantage might be, and we perceive none. By failing to make a waiver claim, the state must then defend against the claim and risk a decision by the reviewing court in favor of the defendant. Even if the defendant's argument had some degree of validity, the defense must bear its share of responsibility for making certain that the jury instructions are correct. Thus, when defense counsel fails to take advantage of the many opportunities available during the trial proceedings to obtain accurate instructions, the defendant cannot blame the state for deciding in some cases and not in others to assert a claim of waiver. Regardless of any uncertainty, however, defendants\n   should expect the state to assert a waiver claim in\n   <em>\n    any\n   </em>\n   case in which such a claim may be validly raised and have no reason to complain if the state fails to do so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   With respect to habeas review, the defendant argues that review typically takes place several years after the resolution of a direct appeal, prevents the speedy correction of obvious constitutional errors and puts further pressure on an already overburdened habeas docket. We agree that habeas review delays the resolution of an instructional claim that is deemed waived on direct appeal. We nonetheless consider habeas review good policy because only in the habeas court may a record be developed sufficient to determine whether counsel waived the claim for constitutionally acceptable strategic reasons. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   , supra, 299 Conn. at 497,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"109\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20A.3d%20942\">\n    10 A.3d 942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As we explained in\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   : \"[A] habeas proceeding provides a superior forum for the review of a claim of ineffective assistance because it provides the opportunity for an evidentiary hearing in which the attorney whose conduct is challenged may testify regarding the reasons he did not contest the instruction at trial. ... A habeas proceeding thus enables the court to determine whether counsel's failure to take exception or otherwise to participate in formulating the instructions was due to mere incompetence or to counsel's trial strategy, which would not be possible in a direct appeal in which there is no possibility of an evidentiary hearing. An aggrieved party is thus not without recourse in the event that the\n   court deems a claim of instructional impropriety waived on appeal.\" (Citation omitted.)

That is because the plain error doctrine in Connecticut, \"codified at Practice Book \u00a7 60-5, is an extraordinary remedy used by appellate courts [only] to rectify errors committed at trial that, although unpreserved, are of such monumental proportion that they threaten to erode our system of justice and work a serious and manifest injustice on the aggrieved party.

In addition, the plain error doctrine is reserved for truly extraordinary situations [in which] the existence of the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings. ... Plain error is a doctrine that should\n   be invoked sparingly. ... Implicit in this very demanding standard is the notion ... that invocation of the plain error doctrine is reserved for occasions requiring the reversal of the judgment under review. ... [Thus, an appellant] cannot prevail under [the plain error doctrine] ... unless he demonstrates that the claimed error is both so clear and so harmful that a failure to reverse the judgment would result in manifest injustice.\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4142981\" index=\"157\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/290/278/#p289\">\n    290 Conn. 278\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 289,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"158\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=963%20A.2d%2011\">\n    963 A.2d 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   In sum, federal law generally, but not always, limits waiver in jury instruction cases to a small number of cases in which the disputed instruction has been discussed on the record at trial or in which there is clear evidence in the record that the instruction was accepted by defense counsel for tactical reasons. Virtually all other jury instruction claims are considered forfeited and are subject only to plain error review. Although plain error may be found in some cases, a remedy is not mandated but, rather, is granted at the discretion of the reviewing court upon a showing that the error was clear and affected the defendant's substantial rights. In Connecticut, however, the system for reviewing unpreserved constitutional claims is more complicated. Unpreserved claims that have not been waived are not automatically reviewed under the plain error doctrine because the plain error doctrine in Connecticut, unlike under federal law, is one of reversibility rather than reviewability. In other words, plain error is reserved for the very few cases in which the alleged error is so extraordinary that automatic reversal is required, there being no need for a discretionary determination by the court regarding the imposition of a remedy. Consequently, most forfeited claims of constitutional dimension in Connecticut are reviewed under\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   if they have not been waived. Given these differences, the\n   defendant's comparison of forfeited claims under state law with forfeited\n   claims under federal law that are afforded plain error review is inappropriate because it presumes that plain error review is the same in the state and federal systems. It is not. We therefore reject the defendant's comparison of state and federal law on waiver and forfeiture as misleading and irrelevant.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-49\">\n   We instead agree with the state that the rule in\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   improves the process of constructing fair and balanced jury instructions because it provides incentives to the parties and the court to ensure that the instructions are accurate. In contrast, allowing appellate review of any unpreserved jury instruction claim of constitutional magnitude under\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   gives appellate counsel unbridled freedom to raise a multiplicity of jury instruction claims that trial counsel waived for tactical reasons, as was the case in\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   . Finally, the defendant never explains why an express waiver is not subject to many of the same deficiencies attributed to an implicit waiver, such as the failure of counsel to perceive a defect in a particular instruction, even though counsel may have suggested or specifically approved of the instruction during an on-the-record charging conference. We therefore conclude that the implied waiver rule this court adopted in\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   should not be overturned.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The concurring justices disagree with the\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   waiver rule on the ground that it is too expansive and upsets the balance achieved under\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   . Chief Justice Rogers, who embraces an approach to waiver similar to the federal approach, is specifically concerned that habeas review is not an effective and equivalent substitute for direct appellate review of novel constitutional claims because it involves substantial delay and provides an inhospitable framework for resolving such claims. She also contends that the waiver rule has spawned an entirely new area of jurisprudence\n   addressing whether the requirements for waiver have been met, and fears that a claim of instructional error deemed waived under\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   will be raised anew in a habeas proceeding. We disagree.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   With respect to her first concern, Chief Justice Rogers overlooks our express determination in this case to \"leave the merits and a full discussion of this argument for another day, when such a claim is presented to this court on direct appeal.\" Footnote 22 of this opinion. As for her contention that the waiver rule in\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   has created an entirely new area of jurisprudence, there is no evidence to support this claim.\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   is only one in a long line of cases over the course of several decades in which Connecticut courts have considered implied waiver in the context of jury instruction claims. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   , supra, 299 Conn. at 470-72,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"159\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20A.3d%20942\">\n    10 A.3d 942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citing more than fifteen years of precedent addressing implied waiver of jury instruction claims). Thus, clarification of Connecticut's waiver law in\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   has not resulted, nor will it result, in an entirely new area of jurisprudence. Reviewing courts always have been required to examine the specific facts and circumstances of each case to determine whether waiver occurred. The only difference between past and future waiver cases is that the rule is more specific under\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   with respect to jury instructions because it incorporates the requirements of the rules of practice. It is therefore unlikely that courts will spend more time addressing waiver claims in the post-\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   era. Rather, courts are likely to spend less time reviewing such claims because\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   narrowed the concept of waiver by specifying the conditions under which waiver may be found and precluding waiver solely on the ground that counsel generally agreed with the proposed instructions. This will potentially result in more accurate\n   jury instructions and fewer waiver claims for reviewing courts to consider. Indeed, Chief Justice Rogers\n   concedes that the rule in\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   has resulted in a reduction in the number of direct appeals substantively addressing claims of instructional error. Not surprisingly, an examination of habeas cases decided in the post-\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   era also reveals that very few defendants have filed petitions alleging ineffective assistance of trial counsel on the ground that counsel implicitly waived a jury instruction claim under\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   . See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Warden\n   </em>\n   , supra, Superior Court, Docket No. TSR-CV-11-4003979-S ;\n   <em>\n    Bharrat\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   , Superior Court, judicial district of Tolland, Docket No. TSR-CV-12-4004615-S (August 27, 2014), appeal dismissed,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12486295\" index=\"160\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/143/1106/\">\n    167 Conn.App. 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12486295\" index=\"161\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/143/1106/\">\n    143 A.3d 1106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016). Moreover, the petitions in those cases also contained claims of error unrelated to\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   . Chief Justice Rogers' concern that\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   will result in an entirely new area of jurisprudence and a greater workload for Connecticut courts is thus unwarranted.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-52\">\n   Finally, to the extent Chief Justice Rogers prefers the federal approach to determining whether a jury instruction claim has been waived, we point to the imbalance that would result from attempting to combine federal and state waiver law. Although federal waiver law permits the review of a greater number of claims than would be permissible under state law because more federal claims are deemed forfeited, and thus reviewable, than would be deemed reviewable under\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   , the ultimate remedy under the federal plain error doctrine is more difficult to obtain than the remedy available under\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   that Chief Justice Rogers recommends. That is because the federal remedy for plain error is discretionary, whereas the remedy under\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   is automatic reversal of the judgment if the four-pronged test of\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   is satisfied. Accordingly, permitting Connecticut courts to review a greater number of claims by following federal forfeiture law in the absence of a state remedy comparable to the stringent\n   federal plain error remedy for determining whether claims succeed opens the door to the abuses that\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   review was intended to discourage, such as trial by ambuscade. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Moye\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"162\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=316%20Conn.%20779\">\n    316 Conn. 779\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 784-85,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"163\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=114%20A.3d%20925\">\n    114 A.3d 925\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015). Adoption of the federal standard on forfeiture to determine whether jury instruction claims may be reviewed, as Chief Justice Rogers suggests, also would result in two different waiver standards for determining whether unpreserved claims may be reviewed, one standard for reviewing jury instruction claims and another standard for reviewing other unpreserved claims, which would lead to confusion and unnecessary inconsistency in our waiver law.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-53\">\n   We turn next to Justice Palmer's concurring opinion, in which he also argues that the waiver rule in\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   should be overturned. We reject his lengthy analysis in all respects because, among other things, it is based in part on the construction of a false dichotomy between the reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   and the present case, and on an incorrect understanding of how the court in\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   used the term \"acquiescence\" when discussing the state's claims and Connecticut's prior waiver law. We also reject Justice Palmer's approach to waiver, which is far more extreme than the federal approach and, to our knowledge, has not been adopted by any other jurisdiction. Indeed, the approach he suggests would have the effect of virtually eliminating Connecticut's implied waiver doctrine in the context of jury instruction claims. We address each point in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-54\">\n   Justice Palmer initially contends that the implied waiver rule in\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   was predicated on the legal fiction, or presumption,\n   \"that a defense counsel who reviews and then acquiesces in the trial court's proposed instructions has considered and declined to raise every potential objection to every part of the instructions\" but that we have \"disavowed\" this rationale and\n   now justify the rule on the ground that \"defense counsel, upon reviewing the trial court's proposed jury charge, knowingly and voluntarily waives her client's procedural right to later challenge those instructions on appeal.\" This is simply untrue. There is no difference in the reasoning articulated in\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   and the present case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-55\">\n   Justice Palmer constructs a false dichotomy lacking any basis in fact. The court in\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   repeatedly explained, as we do in the present case, that waiver involves the \"intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege\"; (internal quotation marks omitted)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   , supra, 299 Conn. at 469,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"164\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20A.3d%20942\">\n    10 A.3d 942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; accord id., at 474,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"165\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20A.3d%20942\">\n    10 A.3d 942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; and that, \"among the rights that may be waived by the action of counsel in a criminal proceeding is the right of a defendant to proper jury instructions.\" Id., at 467. The court in\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   also described the state's argument as whether the defense had \"waived or forfeited the right to challenge [the jury instructions] on appeal\"; id., at 473,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"166\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20A.3d%20942\">\n    10 A.3d 942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; ultimately concluding that, if the criteria for the\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   waiver rule are satisfied, \"the defendant may be deemed to have knowledge of any potential flaws [in the jury instructions] and to have waived implicitly the constitutional right to challenge the instructions on direct appeal.\" Id., at 483,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"167\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20A.3d%20942\">\n    10 A.3d 942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Thereafter, the court in\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   similarly acknowledged that \"implied waiver, as alleged in [that] case, arises from an inference that the defendant knowingly and voluntarily relinquished the right in question\"; (emphasis omitted)\n   <extracted-citation index=\"168\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20A.3d%20942\">\n    id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; and that competent counsel is presumed, \"when determining whether a defendant's waiver of a constitutional right or statutory privilege has been knowing and intelligent.\" Id., at 489,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"169\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20A.3d%20942\">\n    10 A.3d 942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Insofar as the court in\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   also stated in a footnote that counsel's acceptance of the jury instructions following sufficient notice of their content supports an inference that counsel had knowledge of all potential constitutional defects contained therein;\n   <extracted-citation index=\"170\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20A.3d%20942\">\n    id.,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at 487 n.25,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"171\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20A.3d%20942\">\n    10 A.3d 942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; that statement was intended to\n   explain in part why waiver constitutes a knowing and voluntary relinquishment of the right to appeal a jury instruction claim. Accordingly, there is no basis for Justice Palmer's argument that our reasoning in the present case differs on this essential point from the reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-56\">\n   Justice Palmer also argues that the court in\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   failed to provide clear guidance as to what constitutes implied waiver, in part because the court used the term \"acquiescence\" in a \"misleading and inconsistent manner.\" He contends that \"\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   described as acquiescence everything from defense counsel's sitting silently by and failing to object to the court's jury charge to defense counsel's expression of affirmative satisfaction or agreement with the charge,\" and that the result of this inconsistency is confusion and a lack of understanding as to the type of conduct that may lead to a finding of waiver. Justice Palmer also claims that the court in\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   and the majority opinion in the present case have indicated that \"mere acquiescence\" constitutes waiver, which entails passive acceptance. This is not the case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   Justice Palmer continues to misunderstand the reasoning in\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   and the present case. The court in\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   did not use the term \"acquiescence\" when articulating the modified waiver rule but described\n   implied waiver as requiring, among other things, counsel's \"affirmative acceptance\" of the instructions that were given.\n   <footnotemark>\n    24\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   , supra, 299 Conn. at 484, 496,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"172\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20A.3d%20942\">\n    10 A.3d 942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; see also id., at 482-83,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"173\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20A.3d%20942\">\n    10 A.3d 942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The court in\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   also expressly cautioned that \"mere acquiescence\" is not sufficient to establish waiver.\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   <extracted-citation index=\"174\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20A.3d%20942\">\n    Id.,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at 483 n.23,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"175\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20A.3d%20942\">\n    10 A.3d 942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . As we explain in this opinion and in\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   , \"mere acquiescence\" is insufficient to establish waiver because a finding of waiver requires that all of the facts and circumstances be taken into account, including \"whether counsel had been given a meaningful opportunity to review, comment on and express satisfaction with the instructions, [and] whether counsel had, in fact, expressed such satisfaction before or after the instructions were given.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"176\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20A.3d%20942\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   Justice Palmer's fixation on the court's occasional use of the term \"acquiescence\" in\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   when describing the state's arguments and the decisions of other jurisdictions discussing waiver claims, and his suggestion that\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   intended waiver to be found only when there is mere acquiescence with respect to the court's proposed instructions, is thus unjustified. To the extent Justice Palmer's concern may stem from the fact that neither\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   nor this opinion precisely defines the meaning of \"affirmative acceptance,\" we determined in\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   that whether counsel has satisfied this requirement is best left to the discretion of the reviewing court after examining the record before it. Moreover, we are not aware of any case in which a reviewing court has construed \"affirmative acceptance\" as meaning passive acquiescence. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Johnson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"177\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=316%20Conn.%2045\">\n    316 Conn. 45\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 53,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"178\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=111%20A.3d%20436\">\n    111 A.3d 436\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015) (affirmative acceptance means counsel must express satisfaction with instruction, not merely acquiesce in it);\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Webster\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"179\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=308%20Conn.%2043\">\n    308 Conn. 43\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 63,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"180\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=60%20A.3d%20259\">\n    60 A.3d 259\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013) (finding waiver in part because court solicited comments from counsel several times during and following charging conference, and counsel ultimately affirmatively accepted instructions proposed and given). In sum, nothing in\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   or this opinion supports Justice Palmer's suggestion that\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   endorsed a definition of implied waiver that requires no more than passive acceptance of the jury instructions without actually agreeing to them, and his preoccupation with the court's reference to \"acquiescence\" in\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   when describing the state's argument and how other courts have understood waiver in the past is irrelevant.\n   Justice Palmer also argues that\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   should be overruled under the doctrine of stare decisis. We disagree with this argument because we have concluded that\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   was correctly decided. We thus need not address this issue any further.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   In explaining his own view as to when implied waiver should be found, Justice Palmer resurrects his argument in\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   that \"an unpreserved claim that instructional error of constitutional magnitude has occurred should be unreviewable under\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   only when (1) defense counsel induced or invited the error, or (2) it clearly can be inferred that counsel-or the defendant-actually was aware of the alleged defect in the instruction but chose for strategic or other reasons not to object (true waiver).\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   Given his critique of\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   and his apparent willingness to accept the concept of implied waiver, even though narrowly drawn, this standard makes no sense for two reasons.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   First, the unavailability of\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   review in cases of induced or invited error is based on exactly the same presumption, or \"legal fiction,\" Justice Palmer rejects as \"illogical,\" \"unfounded\" and \"implausible\" in the context of implied waiver under\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   . The presumption is that the claim is unreviewable because the defendant had knowledge of any potential flaws in the instructions that were given but intentionally disregarded them for strategic reasons.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   , supra, 299 Conn. at 470,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"181\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20A.3d%20942\">\n    10 A.3d 942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[t]he rationale for declining to review jury instruction claims when the instructional error was induced or the claim was implicitly waived is precisely the same: [t]o allow [a] defendant to seek reversal [after] ... his trial strategy has failed would amount to allowing him to [induce potentially harmful error and then] ... ambush the state [and the trial court] with that claim on appeal\" [internal quotation marks omitted] ); accord\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Fabricatore\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3950929\" index=\"182\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/281/469/#p482\">\n    281 Conn. 469\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 482,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"183\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=915%20A.2d%20872\">\n    915 A.2d 872\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007) ;\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Gibson\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5302500\" index=\"184\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/270/55/#p67\">\n    270 Conn. 55\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 67,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"185\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=850%20A.2d%201040\">\n    850 A.2d 1040\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004) ;\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Cruz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8457357\" index=\"186\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/269/97/#p106\">\n    269 Conn. 97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 106,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"187\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=848%20A.2d%20445\">\n    848 A.2d 445\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004). In neither circumstance is the record required to show that the defendant was actually aware of the specific instructional error that is claimed on appeal. Accordingly, Justice Palmer's unwillingness to allow\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   review in cases of induced or invited error is at odds with his willingness to allow\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   review of claimed error that has been implicitly waived under\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   Second, Justice Palmer's definition of implied waiver, which would limit waiver to cases in which \"it clearly can be inferred that counsel-or the defendant-actually was aware of the alleged defect in the instruction but chose for strategic or other reasons not to object (true waiver),\" is so narrow that it abolishes, for all\n   intents and purposes, the implied waiver doctrine in Connecticut in the context of jury instruction claims. In\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   , the court responded to this same, now recycled argument by observing that the concept of implied waiver under Justice Palmer's definition very likely would be \"eviscerate[d]\" because \"there appears to be no way that counsel may clearly demonstrate such knowledge except by expressly informing the court.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    27\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   , supra, 299 Conn. at 485 n.25,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"188\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20A.3d%20942\">\n    10 A.3d 942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

For example, he declares that incarcerated defendants will suffer unnecessarily under\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   as a result of having to litigate their jury instruction claims in habeas proceedings and proclaims that Juma Lahai, the petitioner in\n   <em>\n    Lahai\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Warden\n   </em>\n   , Superior Court, judicial district of Tolland, Docket No. TSR-CV-09-4003028-S,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"193\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%201959065\">\n    2012 WL 1959065\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (Conn.Super.

When\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   was decided, we predicted that the rule would increase rather than decrease the burden on judicial resources because any time saved in avoiding appellate review of instructional error would be more than offset by the need for a full habeas trial on the issue. In fact, of the six cases decided in the year following this court's decision in\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   in which the Appellate Court found claims of instructional error waived under\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   , four already have resulted in habeas petitions related to the alleged instructional error.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   \"When\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   was decided, we also warned that habeas proceedings would only push back the inevitable, as petitioners whose ineffective assistance of counsel\n   claims were denied on collateral review ultimately would return to the Appellate Court for review of those decisions. Sure enough, the first generation of post-\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   habeas appeals is now coming home to roost.

Justice Palmer thus suggests an impending flood of new habeas litigation based on\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   . We nonetheless ask, what, exactly, is coming home to roost?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   Justice Palmer cites four habeas cases during the past five years in which a\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   claim was purportedly\n   raised. Four cases in five years, however, can hardly be regarded as an intolerable consequence of\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   . Moreover, none of the cited cases is relevant because the rule in\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   was either not raised or only one of several issues raised by the petitioner. In\n   <em>\n    Carrion\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Warden\n   </em>\n   , Superior Court, judicial district of Tolland, Docket No. TSR-CV-11-4004163-S (December 15, 2015), for example, the petitioner, Christopher Carrion, asserted three claims of error, only one of which was a claim of ineffective assistance based on instructional impropriety.\n   <footnotemark>\n    31\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore, the habeas court in\n   <em>\n    Carrion\n   </em>\n   did not consider trial counsel's conduct under the performance prong (first prong) of\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   . See\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12486295\" index=\"213\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/143/1106/\">\n    id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; see also\n   <em>\n    Strickland\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Washington\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"214\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    466 U.S. at 687\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6204802\" index=\"215\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/466/668/#p687\">\n    104 S.Ct. 2052\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This court previously had concluded, in a majority opinion authored by Justice Palmer, that, even if it assumed, without deciding, that Carrion's claim of instructional impropriety had not been implicitly waived under\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   , the challenged instruction had not deprived Carrion of a fair trial.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Carrion\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"216\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=313%20Conn.%20823\">\n    313 Conn. 823\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 827,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"217\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=100%20A.3d%20361\">\n    100 A.3d 361\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014). The habeas court in\n   <em>\n    Carrion\n   </em>\n   thus disposed of the\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   claim in a single sentence, noting this court's conclusion that the instruction was not harmful and stating that \"the issue as to this jury instruction is res judicata ....\" (Emphasis omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Carrion\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Warden\n   </em>\n   , supra. Carrion is now appealing from the judgment denying his habeas petition to the Appellate Court but has raised no jury instruction claim.\n   <em>\n    Carrion\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   , Connecticut Appellate Court, Docket No. AC 38794 (appeal filed January 15, 2016). Accordingly, there is no basis for Justice Palmer's conclusion that\n   <em>\n    Carrion\n   </em>\n   is the first of many \"post-\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   habeas appeals ... coming home to roost.\" To the contrary, instructional error in\n   <em>\n    Carrion\n   </em>\n   was only a minor part of Carrion's ineffective assistance of counsel claim and is not being litigated in the appeal from the habeas court's judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-66\">\n   As for the other three cases that Justice Palmer cites, the court determined in\n   <em>\n    Lahai\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Warde\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    n\n   </em>\n   , supra, Superior Court, Docket No. TSR-CV-09-4003028-S, that the instructional error had been induced; and no\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   claim was raised in\n   <em>\n    Myers\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Warden\n   </em>\n   , Superior Court, judicial district of Tolland, Docket No. TSR-CV-14-4005938-S (withdrawn August 12, 2016), or in the habeas proceeding and appeal that followed in\n   <em>\n    Bharrat\n   </em>\n   . See generally\n   <em>\n    Bharrat\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   , supra, 167 Conn.App. at 158,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12486295\" index=\"218\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/143/1106/\">\n    143 A.3d 1106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ;\n   <em>\n    Bharrat\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   , supra, Superior Court, Docket No. TSR-CV-12-4004615-S. Consequently, Justice Palmer provides no reliable support for his claim that a large amount of habeas litigation will be coming home to roost in the post-\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   era.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-67\">\n   Justice Palmer finally suggests, as he did in\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   , that the waiver of a\n   jury instruction claim under\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   may be overcome if defense counsel informs the trial court that he has not raised a constitutional challenge to the charge because he is unaware of any such claim. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   , supra, 299 Conn. at 541,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"219\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20A.3d%20942\">\n    10 A.3d 942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Palmer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    J.\n   </em>\n   , concurring). He also suggests that the defense bar should test this theory. We reject these suggestions not only for the reasons stated in\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   ; see\n   <extracted-citation index=\"220\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20A.3d%20942\">\n    id.,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at 485 n.25,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"221\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=108%20A.3d%201083\">\n    108 A.3d 1083\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; but for the additional reason that such conduct would be inconsistent with our rules of practice, which seek to encourage good faith participation by counsel in the formulation of jury instructions.

We disagree. There is no such \"exchange\" because waiver of the foregoing rights is within the complete control of the defendant. Even if the waivers are viewed as involving a so-called \"exchange,\" however, the gains to which Chief Justice Rogers refers do not necessarily have any clear practical value. Waiving the right to trial counsel, for example, does not provide defendants who have no knowledge of the law or legal experience with any obvious benefit other than the satisfaction of self-representation, despite the newly acquired ability to control trial strategy. In contrast, criminal defendants who waive a claim of instructional error are still able to utilize the wide array of procedural tools available to ensure that the jury instructions are correct. As discussed in this opinion, these tools include the rules of practice, which provide defendants and their counsel with numerous opportunities to participate in the formulation of the jury instructions throughout the proceedings. Chief Justice Rogers specifically recognizes this benefit when she states: \"[T]here are features unique to jury instructions that justify holding counsel to a higher standard of accountability for failing to preserve claims of error. ... Specifically, jury instructions are carefully formulated outside of the rush of trial pursuant to the rules of practice that afford counsel a large degree of participation in a structured process. The purpose of these rules is to detect error at the earliest possible juncture, and the threat of an implied waiver of an instructional claim on appeal, at least in narrowly defined circumstances, provides an appropriate incentive for the opportunity to be taken seriously.\" Footnote 16 of Chief Justice Rogers' concurring opinion. She adds, and we agree, that \"[t]he detection of error at trial, without the necessity of an appeal, is the most desirable outcome for purposes of both fairness to defendants and the efficient operation of the court system.\"\n    <extracted-citation index=\"252\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=958%20A.2d%20754\">\n     Id.\n    </extracted-citation>\n    We finally note that a criminal defendant who waives the right to trial, to counsel or to a probable cause hearing, like a defendant who waives the right to challenge a jury instruction, still waives all of the potential claims that he might have been entitled to bring if the right had not been waived. Accordingly, the waiver of a claim of instructional error is analogous to the waiver of other constitutional rights.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"16\">\n   <p id=\"p-204\">\n    In her concurring opinion in\n    <em>\n     Kitchens\n    </em>\n    , Justice Katz noted that, from January 1, 2000, to May 5, 2010, this court considered approximately seventy criminal appeals in which a defendant requested\n    <em>\n     Golding\n    </em>\n    review of instructional error and found reversible error in only six cases.\n    <em>\n     State\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Kitchens\n    </em>\n    , supra, 299 Conn. at 522 n.17,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"253\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20A.3d%20942\">\n     10 A.3d 942\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (\n    <em>\n     Katz\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <em>\n     J.\n    </em>\n    , concurring).

An appellate judge who [finds a]\n    <em>\n     Kitchens\n    </em>\n    waiver during the direct appeal may, a few years later, be presented with the same issue in the habeas appeal.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"21\">\n   <p id=\"p-211\">\n    Trial counsel's testimony at the habeas proceedings in\n    <em>\n     Kitchens\n    </em>\n    also refutes the defendant's suggestion in the present case that counsel would never implicitly waive jury instruction claims as a matter of trial strategy. Counsel may have perfectly legitimate reasons, as he did in\n    <em>\n     Kitchens\n    </em>\n    , to create a theory of defense that not only does not involve the issue raised in the jury instruction claim on appeal, but would be weakened by a jury instruction request inconsistent with the chosen theory.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"22\">\n   <p id=\"p-212\">\n    To the extent the defendant claims that habeas review does not eliminate the unfairness of finding implied waiver in cases in which counsel challenges an aspect of settled law on direct appeal that was not challenged in the trial proceedings, we note that the defendant is in the same position as all other defendants to whom the law has applied in the past. Moreover, there is nothing to prevent trial counsel from challenging settled law in the trial proceedings, thereby preserving the claim for appellate review.

Upon further reflection, I now realize that, to a defendant with a meritorious constitutional claim, habeas review is not an effective and equivalent substitute for direct appellate review. First, because of the delay attendant to filing a habeas petition, receiving a full hearing and awaiting a decision thereon, a party who ultimately prevails in that forum likely will have spent years of his or her life incarcerated for a conviction that was constitutionally infirm. It is no answer that these cases are relatively few. Second, unlike a direct appeal decided pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   , a habeas appeal presents an inhospitable framework for novel constitutional claims or those that require the overruling of established authority in order to succeed.

In particular, I question whether the intended efficiencies truly will be achieved. Although the rule has reduced the number of direct appeals addressing claims of jury instructional error substantively, it has spawned an entirely new area of jurisprudence addressing whether the requirements\n   for a waiver have been met.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Moreover, when claims are deemed waived under\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   , they are not necessarily disposed of with finality. Rather, at least some, and perhaps many, merely will be deferred, only to be raised anew in a habeas action.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore, the habeas forum is less efficient than a direct appeal in that a trial must be held, at which counsel must explain his or her reasons for\n   failing to object to the instruction at issue, perhaps with yet another appeal to follow. As the majority acknowledges, \"a finding of waiver [in a direct appeal] opens the door to a future habeas proceeding on which the state and the court will be required to expend additional limited resources that could have been devoted to other pending trials.\" Given these circumstances, I am inclined to conclude that disposing of an unpreserved claim of instructional error at the earliest opportunity, on its merits pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   , is the most efficient approach.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, I believe that this court should abandon the\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   experiment of broadly denying direct appellate review of unpreserved constitutional claims of jury instructional error and, instead, return to the much narrower conception of implied waiver in this area that predated\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   . Under pre-\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   implied waiver jurisprudence, a waiver was not deemed to have occurred by application of any preconceived general rule, but rather, was determined more flexibly on a case-by-case basis in view of all the relevant facts and circumstances. Claims of instructional error that were not identified at trial were deemed\n   waived by defense counsel's approval of the charge\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   only when,\n   <em>\n    at the very least\n   </em>\n   , there was specific, on-the-record discussion of\n   <em>\n    the particular instruction\n   </em>\n   later claimed to be defective on appeal, and defense counsel, thereafter, explicitly assented to that instruction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   Stated otherwise, the record demonstrated that counsel was focused on the specific instruction later claimed to be erroneous, thought about it, and then indicated to the trial court that he or she had no issue with that instruction.\n   <footnotemark>\n    11\n   </footnotemark>\n   Again, an assessment of waiver is dependent on all of the circumstances surrounding this on-the-record discussion of the instruction at issue, and counsel's agreement thereto, but at a very minimum, a focused discussion and agreement must have occurred.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   This approach more closely resembles that generally taken in the federal courts,\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   which also permit\n   appellate review of forfeited claims but deny it to waived claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although\n   even a narrower implied waiver rule rests on an inference, rather than actual proof, that counsel consciously decided to abandon a known claim, it is a much more reasonable inference\n   <footnotemark>\n    15\n   </footnotemark>\n   and, I believe, one that appropriately accounts for the varying interests of defendants, the state, courts and society at large.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Applying the narrower, pre-\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   analysis to the facts of this case leads me to conclude that the defendant's instructional claim was not waived and, therefore, should be reviewed pursuant to\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"566558\" index=\"333\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/213/233/#p239\">\n    213 Conn. at 239-40\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"334\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=567%20A.2d%20823\">\n    567 A.2d 823\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The defendant's claim is that the trial court's instruction on identification was improper, because it did not include certain factors that a jury should consider when determining whether a particular identification is reliable. The record indicates that, following the trial court's distribution of written copies of its proposed charges, the court held an in-chambers, off-the-record charging conference with counsel. Thereafter, on the record, the trial court described certain changes to the instructions that it would be making. The trial court mentioned in particular that its proposed charge included an identification instruction that included some factors to be considered, without any elaboration as to those factors, then it stated that it would be adding language to the effect that it was the state's burden to show that the defendant was the person who had committed the crime.\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   There was no on-the-record discussion between the trial court\n   and counsel concerning the identification instruction. After describing one other instruction, the trial court asked counsel whether they had any further exceptions, and both counsel stated that they did not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-80\">\n   Under these circumstances, I would not find a waiver of the defendant's instructional claim. First, there is no copy of the trial court's proposed instructions in the record. Furthermore, although the record suggests that the trial court and counsel discussed the identification instruction in chambers, the extent of that discussion and defense counsel's participation therein is not apparent. Finally, there is no substantive, on-the-record discussion of the instruction to evidence defense counsel's focus thereon. Rather, the trial court's description of the instruction, to which counsel\n   thereafter simply agreed, is quite general. In my view, this is not enough to infer waiver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-81\">\n   Although I believe that the defendant's request for\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   review of his claim should not be foreclosed due to waiver, I nevertheless conclude that the claim necessarily fails for another reason. Specifically, because the claim is instructional and not constitutional in nature; see footnote 2 of this concurring opinion; it cannot prevail under the second prong of\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   . Accordingly, I would affirm the judgment of the Appellate Court based on different reasoning.

This same standard applies regardless of whether the waiver is implied (by conduct) or express (verbal), and, indeed, the state bears an especially high burden of proof when seeking to establish that a criminal defendant has waived by implication one of his fundamental constitutional rights. See part I B of this opinion. In seeking to justify its new rule, then, the\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   majority faced a conundrum: on what basis can we conclude that any defense counsel who merely acquiesces in an incorrect jury instruction has knowingly and voluntarily chosen to waive her client's right to a properly instructed jury, when it is at least as likely that, in the \"the hurried and ... hectic process of trial\";\n   <em>\n    People\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ladas\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2779844\" index=\"342\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-2d/12/290/#p294\">\n    12 Ill.2d 290\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 294,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"343\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=146%20N.E.2d%2057\">\n    146 N.E.2d 57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1957) ; she simply failed to identify the defect later claimed on appeal?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-86\">\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   ' initial solution to this conundrum was to take refuge in what the majority in that case conceded\n   as a pure \"legal fiction,\" namely, the presumption that a defense counsel who reviews and then acquiesces in the trial court's proposed instructions has considered and declined to raise every potential objection to every part of the instructions. (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   , supra, 299 Conn. at 487 n.25,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"344\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20A.3d%20942\">\n    10 A.3d 942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . This legal fiction justification for the\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   rule was illogical and unfounded from the start, and, to their credit, both the state and the majority in the present case now appear to have disavowed it. In its stead, however, they have set an equally implausible rationale, namely, that each defense counsel, upon reviewing the trial court's proposed jury charge, knowingly and voluntarily waives her client's procedural right to later challenge those instructions on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-87\">\n   Unfortunately, this new theory fares no better than\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   ' original legal fiction theory. There is a strong presumption against a finding of waiver, especially with respect to the constitutional rights of criminal defendants, and waiver-whether substantive or procedural-can be found only when there is unambiguous evidence that the defendant, with full understanding of his rights, actually intends to waive them. Each of these principles is black letter law, and each is deeply and firmly rooted in the law of this state. The\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   rule violates all of them. To jettison these well established rules, merely to achieve a desired policy outcome, is to place at risk not only our\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   jurisprudence, and the fundamental rights of criminal defendants, but all of the other branches of the law in which the concept of waiver plays a significant role.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-88\">\n   Rather than adding epicycle upon epicycle in a futile attempt to salvage the unprecedented and unnecessary\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   rule, we should admit the obvious. Descriptively, mere acquiescence, without something more, simply does not meet the high standard our law imposes for establishing a waiver of a defendant's constitutional\n   rights. Normatively, the policy arguments that appear to animate these continued efforts to undercut our well established\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   jurisprudence are untested and unpersuasive. I therefore agree with the defendant, Brandon Montrell Bellamy, that\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   should be overruled as a failed experiment and that we should return to our pre-\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   jurisprudence governing the reviewability of unpreserved claims. See part I of this opinion. Specifically, an unpreserved claim that instructional error of constitutional magnitude has occurred should be unreviewable under\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   only when (1) defense counsel induced or invited the error, or (2) it clearly can be inferred that counsel-or the defendant-actually was aware of the alleged defect in the instruction but chose for strategic or other reasons not to object (true waiver).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-89\">\n   Although I conclude that the defendant's unpreserved claim of instructional error was not waived under the proper legal standard, I do agree with the state that the claim is unreviewable under\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   because the alleged error is not of constitutional magnitude. See part II of this opinion. For this reason, I concur in the judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-90\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   <em>\n    KITCHENS\n   </em>\n   SHOULD BE OVERRULED\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-92\">\n   Although the court in\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   was not always clear or precise in its use of the term \"waiver,\" I understand the\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   rule-that the defendant implicitly waives the right to raise unpreserved claims of instructional error on appeal-to encompass both a descriptive element (it purports to describe the defendant's actual conduct) and a normative element (it tells us what the legal consequences of that conduct should be).

Descriptively, the court in\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   posited that acquiescence under the conditions outlined in that case supports\n   an inference that defense counsel did in fact knowingly and voluntarily relinquish any and all\n   challenges to the proposed instructions.

See part I C of this opinion. I also explain how the\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   rule easily can be defeated; see part I D of this opinion; and why I am not persuaded by the state's argument that stare decisis requires that we retain the\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   rule despite these serious defects.

Nevertheless, our cases addressing the reviewability of unpreserved claims of instructional error divide fairly readily into three general categories.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   First, at one end of the spectrum, are those cases in which defense counsel sits silently by as the court instructs the jury, with counsel giving no indication whether she objects to or agrees with the court's instructions. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kurvin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"515860\" index=\"348\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/186/555/#p566\">\n    186 Conn. 555\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 557, 563-64,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"349\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=442%20A.2d%201327\">\n    442 A.2d 1327\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1982). Although run-of-the-mill claims of instructional error are forfeited if not timely raised at trial and, therefore, are not reviewable on appeal, there is general agreement that such conduct by counsel does not constitute an implied\n   <em>\n    waiver\n   </em>\n   of unpreserved claims of constitutional error.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   , supra, 299 Conn. at 483 n.23,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"350\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20A.3d%20942\">\n    10 A.3d 942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Accordingly, such claims are reviewable on appeal if the\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   requirements are otherwise satisfied. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"351\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20A.3d%20942\">\n    id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-102\">\n   Second, at the other end of the spectrum, is a broad class of cases in which something in the record indicates either that defense counsel has knowingly and voluntarily waived, on behalf of the defendant, the particular objection at issue on appeal (true waiver), or that she has induced or invited the instructional error that is subsequently challenged on appeal. We have found true waiver both when defense counsel expressly waives the objection at issue,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   and in various situations in which the only reasonable inference is that counsel actually intends to waive the objection (implied waiver). This court or the Appellate Court has found implied waiver, for instance, when it is clear from the record that defense counsel actually was aware of the alleged instructional defect but declined to object or agreed to a curative instruction and thus impliedly waived any objection,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and also when the trial court\n   record strongly suggests that defense counsel declined to object to a particular instruction for identifiable strategic reasons.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Similarly, we have found induced or invited error under three circumstances:\n   (1) when counsel drafts for the court the instructions later challenged on appeal;\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   (2) requests that the trial court draft or reiterate the challenged instruction;\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   or (3) adopts the\n   challenged instruction, or the legal principle on which it is based, as a component of the defense theory.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   Although the majority in\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   contended that we did not rely on the concepts of induced or invited error in cases of the latter two types; see id., at 469-70, 472,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"352\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=88%20A.3d%20445\">\n    88 A.3d 445\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; that clearly is not true. Several of the cited cases, while also using the general term \"waiver,\" expressly refer to the alleged error as one that was induced or invited by the defendant.

Moreover, in each cited case, we relied on the fact that counsel not only declined to object to the instruction at issue, but also actively requested the sort of instruction later challenged on appeal or somehow adopted the principle of law on which it was predicated.

The rationale for the rule that a party who induces or invites an error cannot be heard on appeal to complain about that error is essentially one of unclean hands: \"[t]o allow [a] defendant to seek reversal [after] his trial strategy has failed would amount to allowing him to induce potentially harmful error, and then ambush the state [and the trial court] with that claim on appeal.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Cruz\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8457357\" index=\"373\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/269/97/#p106\">\n    269 Conn. at 106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"374\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=848%20A.2d%20445\">\n    848 A.2d 445\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; see also\n   <em>\n    Gaffney\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Board of Trustees of the Orland Fire Protection District\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"375\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=360%20Ill.%20Dec.%20549\">\n    360 Ill.Dec. 549\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"376\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=969%20N.E.2d%20359\">\n    969 N.E.2d 359\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 368 (2012) (\"it would be manifestly unfair to grant a party relief based on error introduced into the proceedings by that party\");\n   <em>\n    Tenbusch\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Linn County\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"675665\" index=\"377\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/172/172/\">\n    172 Or.App. 172\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 177 n.6,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"675665\" index=\"378\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/or-app/172/172/\">\n    18 P.3d 419\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (induced error doctrine guards against strategic gaming of judicial system), review denied,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"379\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=332%20Or.%20305\">\n    332 Or. 305\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"380\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=27%20P.3d%201045\">\n    27 P.3d 1045\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   The doctrine of waiver, by contrast, is animated largely by the principle of respect for autonomy.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   As\n   one scholar has explained, \"once the defendant has made a free and informed decision to forgo his constitutional defenses, he may constitutionally be held to the consequences of his election.\" P.

By contrast, the rationales on which the state relies-the finality of criminal convictions, fairness to the trial court and the state, and incentivizing diligence by defense counsel at a time when errors can still be corrected-apply equally to types of claims other than instructional errors. In\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   , we made a determination that those considerations are outweighed by the principle that a criminal defendant, at risk of life and liberty, should not be wrongly deprived of his fundamental constitutional rights due to the inadvertence of defense counsel.

A second, related flaw is that the majority in\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   further muddled these distinctions and failed to provide the reviewing court with clear guidance by using key terminology in a misleading and inconsistent manner.

Supreme Court Records &amp; Briefs, March Term, 2010, State's Brief pp. 21-22. The majority in\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   largely adopted both the state's proposed rule and the stated rationale for the rule, holding that, \"when the trial court provides counsel with a copy of the proposed jury instructions, allows a meaningful opportunity for their review, solicits comments from counsel regarding changes or modifications and counsel affirmatively accepts the instructions proposed or given,\n   <em>\n    the defendant may be deemed to have knowledge of any potential flaws therein\n   </em>\n   and to have waived implicitly the constitutional right to challenge the instructions on direct appeal.\" (Emphasis added.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   , supra, 299 Conn. at 482-83,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"432\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20A.3d%20942\">\n    10 A.3d 942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

It would be ludicrous, for example, in the closely related context of medical informed consent, to suggest that a physician who performed elective surgery without informing a patient of the various risks involved could justify the omission by reference to a legal fiction, such as that any patient who previously worked in the health-care sector can be presumed already to have such knowledge.

It makes even less sense to impute to a criminal defendant knowledge of the myriad challenges that might be brought against a proposed set of jury instructions, as would be required to execute a valid waiver, when even his attorney's awareness of such claims is admittedly fictitious.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-117\">\n   The practical fallacies in the original justification for the\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   rule are equally apparent.

See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   , supra, 299 Conn. at 538-39,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"449\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20A.3d%20942\">\n    10 A.3d 942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Palmer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    J.\n   </em>\n   , concurring). \"[B]ecause waiver is the intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right ...\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   requires us to presume, first, that counsel thought of every possible claim, from the most meritorious to the most frivolous, and everything in between, and, second, that, upon due consideration of each and every one of those claims, counsel decided to abandon them all, presumably for strategic reasons. Because it is obviously impossible for any defense attorney, or any team of defense attorneys, to conceive of all potential claims, whether meritorious or not, it is clear that\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   is predicated on a palpably unrealistic assumption.\" (Citation omitted; emphasis omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Davis\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"450\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=311%20Conn.%20468\">\n    311 Conn. 468\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 497,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"451\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=88%20A.3d%20445\">\n    88 A.3d 445\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014) (\n   <em>\n    Palmer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    J.\n   </em>\n   , concurring); see also\n   <extracted-citation index=\"452\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=88%20A.3d%20445\">\n    id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (explaining that, in reality, \"competent defense attorneys invariably raise any and all [potentially meritorious] claims of which they are aware\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-118\">\n   The defects in the original justification for\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   , then, are twofold.\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   relies on a fiction when the law calls for truth.

In the present case, they take pains to disavow\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   ' premise that defense counsel, merely having reviewed and acquiesced\n   in a proposed jury charge, may be presumed to have considered and rejected every potential challenge thereto.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Instead, to replace the missing cornerstone, the state now offers-and the majority embraces-a new justification for\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   ' implied waiver theory. It goes as follows: \"[W]hen the trial court asks counsel to make an informed and binding judgment regarding whether to accept the jury instructions and counsel acquiesces, counsel waives\n   <em>\n    the procedural right\n   </em>\n   to object to the instructions on any of the multitude of possible grounds that counsel might presently be aware of or later perceive.\" (Emphasis added.) In other words,\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   now rests on the theory that defense counsel, by acquiescing in or assenting to the court's jury charge, knowingly and voluntarily relinquishes not a set of specific challenges or objections thereto but, rather, the procedural right of the defendant to later complain about any aspect of the charge. In the remainder of this part of this opinion, I explain why the state's new rationale fares no better than the old one, and why it does not warrant a departure from our pre-\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   jurisprudence.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-123\">\n   The state contends that its new theory does not, in fact, break any new ground but simply applies the preexisting doctrine that the \"waiver of the right to exercise a right precludes [the] later assertion of any and all claims bundled within that right.\" The state argues that this sort of procedural waiver is well established, both in the\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   context and with respect to the waiver of other constitutional rights. The argument fails on many levels.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-124\">\n   I begin by observing that the state's new theory fails to draw the proper parallel between other constitutional rights and the one at issue in\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   . When a defendant waives freedoms such as the right to counsel or\n   the right to trial by jury, he is waiving just that. What he surrenders, fundamentally, is the assistance of an attorney, or the presence of a jury to decide his fate. That he may later be barred from complaining on appeal that he was deprived of his sixth amendment rights is a\n   <em>\n    consequence\n   </em>\n   of that waiver, but the ability to appeal per se is not the right that is waived. In\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   cases, by the same token, what the defendant allegedly waives is not a general procedural right to object or appeal but, rather, the due process right to be tried by a jury that has been properly instructed on the essential elements of the charged crimes, the state's burden of proof, and other constitutionally significant points of law. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Avila\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"527588\" index=\"453\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/223/595/#p603\">\n    223 Conn. 595\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 603,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"454\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=613%20A.2d%20731\">\n    613 A.2d 731\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1992) (right to properly instructed jury is guaranteed by due process clauses of fourteenth amendment to United States constitution\n   and article first, \u00a7 8, of Connecticut constitution); see also\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"566558\" index=\"455\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/213/233/#p239\">\n    213 Conn. 233\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 241,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"456\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=567%20A.2d%20823\">\n    567 A.2d 823\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989) (jury that is properly instructed as to essential elements of charged crimes is necessary to ensure fair trial). What the state needs to demonstrate, then, is that, by acquiescing in the trial court's instructions, a defendant, through counsel, knowingly and voluntarily relinquishes the right to a properly instructed jury, with the understanding that one consequence of that waiver may be the inability to challenge on appeal any subsequently discovered defects in the instructions. As I discuss hereinafter, the circumstances under which any competent attorney would knowingly and voluntarily make such a waiver, or advise a client to do so, are extremely limited. Whereas defense counsel might waive a particular instructional challenge for strategic or other reasons, it is virtually inconceivable that she would freely choose to relinquish a defendant's general right to enforce his right to a properly instructed jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-125\">\n   Before I discuss the specific flaws in the state's new macro waiver theory, I review the well established principles\n   that govern the law of waiver. \"The party alleged to have waived a right must have had both knowledge of the existing right and the intention of forgoing it.\" Black's Law Dictionary, supra, p. 1813 (defining \"waiver\"); see also\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   , supra, 299 Conn. at 469,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"457\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20A.3d%20942\">\n    10 A.3d 942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

Accordingly, if it could be established unequivocally that defense counsel did\n   in fact knowingly and voluntarily waive her client's procedural right to object to a trial court's proposed jury charge, then I might agree that the client could be precluded on appeal from challenging particular aspects of the jury charge, even defects of which the defendant and defense counsel were unaware at the time of trial. The problem is, in the typical\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   scenario, none of these three preconditions for a valid implied waiver is in fact satisfied.\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   improperly presumes waiver in the absence of clear evidence thereof; it does so despite the fact that no reasonable defendant or defense counsel would knowingly execute such a waiver; and it deprives the defendant of the ability to choose\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   to waive\n   his rights, rendering meaningless both the concept of a right and that of a waiver.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-127\">\n   The first problem with the state's new theory is that it, no less than the original\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   rationale, violates the fundamental principle that the waiver of a criminal defendant's constitutional rights cannot be presumed or imputed, but must be demonstrated clearly and unequivocally. \"[T]o establish a waiver of a legal right, there must be a clear, unequivocal, and decisive act of a party showing such a purpose.\" 28 Am.

Rather, an implied waiver must be a true waiver, knowing and voluntary, and courts must be equally certain before concluding that a defendant has waived by implication his fundamental rights. The only difference between express and implied waiver is that, in the latter case, it is the defendant's conduct, rather than his statements, that leaves no doubt of his intent to waive his rights. So, with respect to the fifth amendment right against self-incrimination, for example, waiver may be inferred when a suspect or a defendant, having been properly instructed as to his right to remain silent, proceeds to make a statement to the police or to testify in his own defense. Under those circumstances, assuming that the suspect or the defendant understands what is meant by the right to remain silent, his subsequent choice to make a statement or to testify\n   <em>\n    necessarily\n   </em>\n   implies a voluntary intent to waive that right. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Talton\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"695399\" index=\"486\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/197/280/#p295\">\n    197 Conn. 280\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 295,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"487\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=497%20A.2d%2035\">\n    497 A.2d 35\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1985) (\"[b]y speaking, the defendant has chosen unambiguously not to assert his right to remain silent\"). Similarly, a state will be found to have waived by implication its\n   sovereign and constitutional immunity only when no other conclusion reasonably can be drawn. As the United States Supreme Court explained in\n   <em>\n    Edelman\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Jordan\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6179827\" index=\"488\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/415/651/\">\n    415 U.S. 651\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6179827\" index=\"489\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/415/651/\">\n    94 S.Ct. 1347\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6179827\" index=\"490\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/415/651/\">\n    39 L.Ed.2d 662\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1974), \"[c]onstructive consent is not a doctrine commonly associated with the surrender of constitutional rights, and we see no place for it here.

[W]e must interpret any uncertainty as to the existence of a waiver as preserving sovereign immunity.\" [Citation omitted; emphasis omitted.] ). Neither the state nor the majority has identified any other fundamental right the true waiver of which would be implied merely by presumption, without unequivocal evidence of an actual intent to waive.\n   <footnotemark>\n    20\n   </footnotemark>\n   Nevertheless, the majority, while changing course as to exactly what right is being waived, retains the improper presumption that defense counsel who reviews and acquiesces in the court's proposed instructions knowingly and intentionally waives her client's right to a properly instructed jury, even when the instructions later prove to be defective. Neither the state nor the majority offers any justification for its departure from the black letter legal principle that we will not presume the waiver of fundamental constitutional rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-130\">\n   The second problem with the state's new macro waiver theory is that, unlike with constitutional protections such as the right to counsel and the right against self-incrimination, there is no reason either to conclude or to assume that the defendant in a typical\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   scenario has made a knowing and intelligent decision that the benefits of waiving the right outweigh the costs. Although it is true that a defendant need not have an omniscient understanding of every possible repercussion of such a decision in order to execute a valid waiver, a reviewing court must at least assure itself that the defendant is aware of the basic tradeoffs involved. For example, a defendant who opts to testify in his own defense must understand that, in order to obtain the benefits of setting before the jury his version of the facts and his believability as a witness, he must expose himself to the risks associated with cross-examination and impeachment. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Brown\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6161452\" index=\"495\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/356/148/#p154\">\n    356 U.S. 148\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 154-55,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6161452\" index=\"496\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/356/148/#p154\">\n    78 S.Ct. 622\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6161452\" index=\"497\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/356/148/#p154\">\n    2 L.Ed.2d 589\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1958). Similarly, in order to knowingly and intelligently\n   waive the right to counsel, a defendant must understand that the benefits of self-representation-autonomy and control over trial strategy-are purchased at the cost of an attorney's legal experience, judgment, and familiarity with the rules of practice, all of which help to ensure that the defendant will receive a fair trial. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Faretta\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    California\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9431\" index=\"498\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/422/806/#p836\">\n    422 U.S. 806\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 834-35,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9431\" index=\"499\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/422/806/#p836\">\n    95 S.Ct. 2525\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"9431\" index=\"500\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/422/806/#p836\">\n    45 L.Ed.2d 562\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1975) ;\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Townsend\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"540926\" index=\"501\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/211/215/#p218\">\n    211 Conn. 215\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 218-19,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"502\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=558%20A.2d%20669\">\n    558 A.2d 669\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989). In a typical\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   case, by contrast, unless there is evidence either that the parties discussed the specific defect at issue, or that defense counsel's failure to object was intentional and strategic, there simply is no basis for concluding that the defendant made an informed and intelligent decision to waive his right to a properly instructed jury.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-131\">\n   The state's new theory, namely, that a defendant knowingly chooses to waive not specific objections but, rather, the right to object, presents in turn a new difficulty: why would a defendant ever knowingly waive the right to challenge legally deficient jury instructions when he receives nothing whatsoever in return? For each of the other rights to which the state and the majority analogize the right to a properly instructed jury that was at issue in\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   , a defendant presumably understands that he will derive some important benefit in exchange for relinquishing the right and, possibly, the ability to appeal if unforeseen problems later arise. For example, a defendant forgoes: the right to counsel for the ability to control his own representation; the right against self-incrimination for the opportunity to testify in his own defense and to tell the jury his side of the story; the right to a jury trial for the ability to have a dispassionate and legally knowledgeable judge determine his guilt; and the right to a trial for the reduced sentencing risk associated with a guilty plea.\n   <footnotemark>\n    21\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-132\">\n   With\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   , by contrast, one is hard pressed to identify any reason why an informed, intelligent defendant, or defense counsel, would ever choose to waive the right to argue that the jury was improperly charged as to the elements of the charged crimes, the state's burden of proof, or other constitutionally significant legal principles.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   As Judge Sheldon of the Appellate Court has recently explained, \"[r]egardless of counsel's particular trial strategy on behalf of his client, he simply has no excuse not to insist that the jury be properly instructed on each essential element of every charged offense .... [T]here is no conceivable tactical justification for defense counsel not to preserve his client's right not to be convicted without proof beyond a reasonable doubt of each essential element of each charged offense by insisting that proper jury instructions be given on those elements ....\"\n   <em>\n    Holloway\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12415536\" index=\"503\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/145/353/#p366\">\n    145 Conn.App. 353\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 366-67,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"504\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=77%20A.3d%20777\">\n    77 A.3d 777\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013). And if no competent counsel or defendant would waive such a right, then on what basis does the\n   majority assume that all such decisions are knowing and intelligent?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-133\">\n   The third-and perhaps most significant-flaw in the state's new theory of implied waiver is that it improperly assumes that defense counsel in a\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   case\n   <em>\n    voluntarily\n   </em>\n   chooses to relinquish the defendant's right to challenge the jury instructions on appeal. In order for\n   a decision \"to be deemed voluntary, it must be the product of an essentially free and unconstrained choice.\"\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Garcia\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12028055\" index=\"505\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/890/355/#p360\">\n    890 F.2d 355\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 360 (11th Cir. 1989) ; see also Webster's Third New International Dictionary (2002) p. 2564 (defining \"voluntary\" as \"proceeding from the will: produced in or by an act of choice\"). Each of the other rights to which the state and the majority analogize the right at issue in\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   involves a true choice. The defendant can retain counsel or represent himself; he can testify or remain silent; he can opt for trial by jury or a bench trial; he can plead guilty or take his chances at trial. Under\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   , by contrast, defense counsel who is unaware of any defects in the court's proposed instructions but wishes to retain her client's right to insist on a properly instructed jury and to contest any defects that later come to light is precluded from doing so. The trial court need only afford counsel a reasonable opportunity to review the instructions and then ask her whether they look okay. At that point, counsel cannot articulate objections of which she is not yet aware; nor can she refuse to answer the court's query.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   <em>\n    Her only option is to acquiesce\n   </em>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-134\">\n   An obvious solution to this conundrum would be to allow counsel under those circumstances to inform the court that, following a careful review of the proposed charge, she is not presently aware of any defects but that her client wishes to retain his due process rights to a properly instructed jury should he later become aware of any defects in the charge. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   , supra, 299 Conn. at 541,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"506\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20A.3d%20942\">\n    10 A.3d 942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Palmer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    J.\n   </em>\n   , concurring).

If the majority wishes to decide, for reasons of public policy, that the right to a properly instructed jury will be\n   <em>\n    forfeited\n   </em>\n   if not timely exercised,\n   <footnotemark>\n    25\n   </footnotemark>\n   and that unpreserved constitutional\n   challenges to the instructions will not be subject to\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   review on appeal, that at least I can understand. But\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   , as currently rationalized, renders incoherent, in one fell swoop, both the concept of a right and that of a waiver. It is a high price to pay to avoid having to decide a few more instructional claims.\n   <footnotemark>\n    26\n   </footnotemark>\n   To summarize, there is a strong presumption against finding that a criminal defendant has waived his constitutional rights. Even implied waiver of those rights can be found only on the basis of unequivocal evidence that the defendant, with full knowledge and understanding of his rights, actually intends to waive them. These principles are black letter law, and each is deeply and firmly rooted in the law of Connecticut. The majority fails to explain either how these well established criteria are satisfied in the\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   context, or why they are not applicable. To jettison them, merely to achieve a desired policy outcome, is to place at risk not only our\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   jurisprudence, but all of the other branches of the law in which the concept of waiver plays a fundamental role: constitutional law, collective bargaining, tort, contract, insurance, even sovereign immunity. This, I continue to believe, is a serious mistake.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-137\">\n   C\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-138\">\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   Does Not Reflect Sound Judicial or Public Policy\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-139\">\n   In part I B of this opinion, I explained why I continue to believe that, from a descriptive standpoint, defense counsel who merely acquiesces in a trial court's proposed jury instructions does not thereby signify her client's unequivocal knowing and voluntary intent to relinquish any and all claims, both known and unknown, that the instructions are constitutionally deficient. Because mere acquiescence does not satisfy the well established requirements for a waiver of a defendant's constitutional rights, and because we consistently have held that unpreserved claims that satisfy the four prongs\n   of\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   are reviewable on appeal unless waived, that should be the end of the story. However, because both the state and the majority also have offered various policy rationales why such claims should be treated\n   <em>\n    as if\n   </em>\n   they have been waived, I take this opportunity to reiterate why, from a normative standpoint, I do not believe that the\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   rule reflects sound judicial or public policy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-140\">\n   Rules of reviewability, such as\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   , require that we weigh the constitutional rights of a criminal defendant against the interests of the state in the prompt and efficient administration of justice. See, e.g.,\n   P. Westen, supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"511\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=75%20Mich.%20L.%20Rev.%201238\">\n    75 Mich. L.

If the\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   rule is retained, such opportunities will become increasingly scarce as trial courts adopt the practice of forcing defense counsel to execute a\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   waiver. Indeed, in most of the recent cases in which the state failed to prevail on its waiver argument under\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   , the defendant's claim was deemed not to have been waived only because the record did not indicate that the trial court had given defense counsel adequate opportunity to review and comment on the draft charge or a supplemental charge. If the trial court had dotted all of its I's and crossed all of its T's, the errors likely would have gone uncorrected on appeal.\n   <footnotemark>\n    30\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-145\">\n   On the other side of the ledger, the state and the majority contend that\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   claims should be treated as unreviewable primarily for reasons of expediency and fairness. Neither rationale is persuasive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-146\">\n   With respect to expediency, finality, and judicial economy, the argument for retaining\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   appears to be animated by the antithetical fears that, if we were to return to the state of the law before\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   , either (1) this court and especially the Appellate Court would\n   be inundated by and forced to dedicate scare judicial resources to resolving nonmeritorious jury instruction claims concocted after the fact by overzealous appellate counsel, or (2) an abundance of\n   <em>\n    meritorious\n   </em>\n   claims would result in the reversal of otherwise valid convictions and the need for costly retrials. In fact, the available data suggest that both of these speculative fears are largely unfounded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-147\">\n   With respect to the former concern, there is little evidence that, prior to\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   , our appellate system was bogged down trying to resolve a disproportionately high number of trivial or nonmeritorious claims challenging the constitutionality of criminal jury instructions. A thorough review of all of the claims of unpreserved error raised by criminal defendants in this court and the Appellate Court during the sixteen years leading up to our consideration of\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   , for example, revealed that 10.1 percent of jury instruction claims resulted in a finding of harmful error, whereas only 8.6 percent of noninstructional claims merited reversal. See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   , Conn. Supreme Court Records &amp; Briefs, May Term, 1989, Appendix to the Defendant's Supplemental Brief pp. A1-A103 (surveying cases). By contrast, almost none of the claims that certain statements or testimony had been improperly admitted resulted in reversible error; see\n   <extracted-citation index=\"570\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=950%20A.2d%201283\">\n    id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; and, yet, there is no suggestion that meritless claims of that sort are clogging our appellate system and should be unreviewable on appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-148\">\n   Moreover, it is now clear that any lightening of our appellate docket as a result of\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   has been more than offset by what has become a veritable cottage industry in\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   litigation. That is to say, rather than dedicating our resources to resolving a defendant's legal claim on the merits, this court and the Appellate Court now expend significantly more effort resolving allegations by the state that a particular jury instructional\n   claim has been waived and, therefore, is not entitled to appellate review.

Indeed, as I discuss more fully hereinafter, they may eliminate the need for a costly habeas petition and subsequent appeals that would result from finding a claim unreviewable under\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   . Accordingly, I am not swayed by the parade of horribles that the state invokes in its brief.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   The state's second set of policy arguments relates to questions of fairness. I understand the state's position to be that defense counsel who fails to raise a potentially meritorious challenge during the charging conference does so either for tactical reasons or inadvertently. If the decision is tactical, the state contends, we should not give the defendant a second bite at the apple and permit counsel to try out a different tactic on appeal when the tactic utilized at trial was unsuccessful. By contrast, if the failure to object is inadvertent, then we should adopt rules of reviewability that will incentivize greater diligence or, in the absence of such rules, leave to the habeas courts any claims that counsel's performance was ineffective. In either case, the state believes that allowing a defendant to press on appeal objections that his counsel failed to raise at trial would be unfair both to the state and to the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Although the state's concerns are well taken, I ultimately find its arguments to be unpersuasive. Turning first to the question of tactical or strategic waiver, I\n   agree with the defendant that it is almost inconceivable that defense counsel would intentionally hold back a potentially meritorious objection and knowingly permit her client's constitutional rights to be trampled, solely so that, if her client is ultimately convicted, appellate counsel might advance a winning argument on appeal. As Judge Henry J. Friendly once explained, \"it is exceedingly hard to visualize a case [in which] a defendant or his lawyer would deliberately lay aside a meritorious claim so as to raise it after the defendant was jailed.\" H. Friendly, \"Is Innocence Irrelevant? Collateral Attack on Criminal Judgments,\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"606\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20U.%20Chi.%20L.%20Rev.%20142\">\n    38 U. Chi. L. Rev. 142\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 158 (1970).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   When the state and the majority presume that a decision to forgo potential objections to the trial court's proposed jury charge is strategic, however, I do not believe that this is the sort of strategy they have in mind.\n   <footnotemark>\n    35\n   </footnotemark>\n   Rather, the concern seems to be that a defendant, having pursued one strategy or theory of the case at trial and having failed to prevail, might change direction on appeal and argue that he should have received the benefit of instructions reflecting a different, perhaps contradictory, strategy.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-155\">\n   As I already discussed; see part I A of this opinion; when the record clearly suggests that defense counsel's failure to raise an instructional challenge at trial was the result of a tactical decision, I agree with the majority that the unpreserved claim should be deemed waived and unreviewable on appeal. This often will be the case, for instance, when counsel does not seek an instruction as to lesser included offenses in the hope that the jury will find the defendant not guilty of the more serious\n   charge; see, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    United States\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Estrada\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    -\n   </em>\n   <em>\n    Fernandez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1540623\" index=\"607\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f3d/150/491/#p496\">\n    150 F.3d 491\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 496 (5th Cir. 1998) ; cf.

As Justice Katz explained in her concurring opinion in\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   , a presumption of strategic waiver \"undermines this court's exhortation that\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   review is intended to break down any categorical or absolute bars to appellate review\n   by foreclosing review of an entire class of trial errors.

I must confess that I am at a loss to understand the majority's apparent belief that treating unpreserved challenges as waived, and insulating them from appellate review, will somehow incentivize the state and trial courts to exercise greater diligence in unearthing such errors. It is the state and the trial\n   court, after all, that stand to lose should a conviction be overturned as a result of the court's instructional error. One would think that, if any extra motivation is required for them to look after the defendant's constitutional rights, it would be the possibility of reversal that would inspire them, rather than the impossibility. In any event, I will focus my analysis on the state's argument that the\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   rule is needed to motivate defense counsel to adequately scrutinize the court's instructions at trial. There are at least three problems with the state's argument.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-158\">\n   First, the majority has provided no support, either empirical or anecdotal, for its assumption that denying review under\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   will reduce the number of cases in which defense counsel fails to identify and object to instructional errors due to mistake or inadvertence. As both courts and commentators have recognized, such a rule offers little deterrent value with respect to such oversights, \"only marginally advances systemic fairness and does so by\n   exacting a heavy price in individual fairness.\"\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Hargrove\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12416314\" index=\"618\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan-app-2d/48/522/#p554\">\n    48 Kan.App.2d 522\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 554,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12416314\" index=\"619\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan-app-2d/48/522/#p554\">\n    293 P.3d 787\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2013) ; see also L.

In fact, the available evidence suggests that\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   has done little to increase the identification and rectification of instructional errors at trial, as this court and the Appellate Court have entertained dozens of claims of unpreserved instructional error in the five and one-half years since that case was decided, with no indication that the incidence of such claims is on the wane.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-159\">\n   Second, even if\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   did create an incentive for defense counsel to exhaustively scrutinize each of the trial court's draft instructions for any possible error, it is far from clear that more efficient administration of\n   justice would result.

Better instead to trust that competent counsel will identify and raise any defects apparent to her at the time of trial, as is her professional obligation; see\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Mungroo\n   </em>\n   , supra, 299 Conn. at 679-80,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"624\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=11%20A.3d%20132\">\n    11 A.3d 132\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Katz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    J.\n   </em>\n   , dissenting); W.

We continue to review unpreserved claims of constitutional error that arises during other phases of the trial-everything from voir dire to the taking of evidence to jury deliberations-even though a\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   -type rule arguably would incentivize defense counsel to more diligently root out error in those stages of the process as well. Why then a special rule for jury instructions?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   The only answer that the state offers is that the drafting of jury instructions is unique in that, at least in theory, it is a more collaborative process, during which the rules of practice encourage the state, defense counsel, and the trial court to pause and jointly reflect on the proper way to instruct the jury on the law. See Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 42-16 through 42-19. This argument proves too much.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-162\">\n   The exact same arguments that the state makes with respect to jury instructions could be made with respect\n   to other phases of trial, such as the selection and exclusion of jurors during voir dire. See W. Pizzi &amp; M. Hoffman, supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"626\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=38%20Am.%20Crim.%20L.%20Rev.%201435\">\n    38 Am. Crim. L. Rev. 1435\n   </extracted-citation>\n   -36. Voir dire also is a collaborative process during which the state, defense counsel, and the trial court work together to select a fair, impartial, and qualified panel, as dictated by the rules of practice. See Practice Book \u00a7 42-3 (parties may stipulate as to reduced panel size); Practice Book \u00a7 42-4 (giving parties five days to challenge array); Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 42-5, 42-11 through 42-13 (parties and trial court are jointly responsible for selection of qualified panel). Jury selection, as with jury instruction, is a more deliberative process, unlike the trial itself, when defense counsel must make snap judgments as to whether to object to particular testimony or evidence. And yet, we\n   have imposed no\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   -type rule to bar review of unpreserved claims concerning voir dire; nor do we presume that defendants have waived all such challenges.

See Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 39-1, 39-3 through 39-5, 39-13 through 39-16 (plea agreements); Practice Book \u00a7\u00a7 43-5, 43-7, 43-13 through 43-16 (sentencing).

See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   , supra, 299 Conn. at 482, 496-98,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"642\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20A.3d%20942\">\n    10 A.3d 942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . I remain unpersuaded. The reasons why a habeas action is not an adequate substitute for appellate review in this context have been fully expounded elsewhere. See, e.g., id., at 523-24,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"643\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20A.3d%20942\">\n    10 A.3d 942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Katz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    J.\n   </em>\n   , concurring); id., at 547-48,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"644\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20A.3d%20942\">\n    10 A.3d 942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Palmer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    J.\n   </em>\n   , concurring); see also L.

App. Prac. &amp; Process 318\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Suffice it to say that many meritorious claims of serious instructional error will not be subject to correction in habeas actions, and even those petitioners who do ultimately prevail in such actions ordinarily must wait years, while they are wrongfully imprisoned,\n   before they can obtain the benefit of such a ruling. Two points, however, do warrant further discussion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-164\">\n   First, with five and one-half years now having passed since we decided\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   , time and experience have borne out my concerns, and those of Justice Katz, that the majority's reliance on habeas proceedings as a panacea was seriously misplaced. When\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   was decided, we predicted that the rule would increase rather than\n   decrease the burden on judicial resources because any time saved in avoiding appellate review of instructional error would be more than offset by the need for a full habeas trial on the issue. In fact, of the six cases decided in the year following our\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   decision in which the Appellate Court found claims of instructional error waived under\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <footnotemark>\n    39\n   </footnotemark>\n   four already have resulted in habeas petitions related to the alleged instructional error.\n   <footnotemark>\n    40\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-165\">\n   When\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   was decided, we also warned that habeas actions would only push back the inevitable, as petitioners whose ineffective assistance of counsel\n   claims were denied on collateral review ultimately would return to the Appellate Court for review of those decisions. Sure enough, the first generation of post-\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   habeas appeals is now coming home to roost. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Bharrat\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Commissioner of Correction\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12486295\" index=\"646\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/143/1106/\">\n    167 Conn.App. 158\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12486295\" index=\"647\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/143/1106/\">\n    143 A.3d 1106\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-166\">\n   In addition, when\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   was decided, we warned that the vindication of meritorious claims would be unreasonably and unfairly delayed.

In that case, the Appellate Court declined to review the unpreserved instructional claim of Juma A. Lahai pursuant to\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   ; id., at 459-60,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"652\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20A.3d%20942\">\n    10 A.3d 942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; even though the state itself conceded that the court's instruction had improperly placed on Lahai the burden of proving self-defense. See id., at 451-52,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"653\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20A.3d%20942\">\n    10 A.3d 942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . We thereafter denied Lahai's petition for certification to appeal.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Lahai\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"6779418,6779355,6779380\" index=\"654\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/301/934/\">\n    301 Conn. 934\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"655\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=23%20A.3d%20727\">\n    23 A.3d 727\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011). In May, 2012, the habeas court granted Lahai's habeas petition and vacated his conviction.\n   <em>\n    Lahai\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Warden\n   </em>\n   , Superior Court, judicial district of Tolland, Docket No. TSR-CV-09-4003028-S (May 7, 2012). Lahai thus remained incarcerated a full year longer than was necessary to review and vindicate his claim.\n   <footnotemark>\n    41\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the usual case, an incarcerated defendant will have to wait far longer for his constitutional rights to be vindicated because, ordinarily, the state will appeal from any adverse habeas judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-167\">\n   Second, I am troubled by the state's argument that a defendant who is barred by\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   from raising a claim on appeal, and whose claim is not a candidate\n   for habeas relief, has not thereby been treated unfairly because the same incorrect law also may have been applied to other defendants' cases. I would remind the state that the defendant's claim is not that he was treated less favorably than others by the criminal justice system, in violation of his right to equal protection of the law. His claim, rather, is that he was deprived of his fundamental right to due process of law and, possibly, wrongly imprisoned as a result. The fact that other defendants also may have been denied a fair trial will be of little consolation, no more than one who is deprived of the right to practice his religion, or whose land is taken without just compensation, will be content to know that his neighbor was treated with equal injustice.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-168\">\n   For all of the foregoing reasons, in the absence of clear evidence that a criminal defendant or defense counsel actually intended to waive a claim that a jury instruction violated the defendant's constitutional rights, I fail to see any reason why this court should insist on treating all such claims as if they had been waived.\n   <footnotemark>\n    42\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-169\">\n   D\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-170\">\n   The\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   Rule Can Easily Be Circumvented\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-171\">\n   As previously discussed, in\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   , I explained how the\n   <em>\n    presumption\n   </em>\n   that a criminal defendant intends to\n   waive his right to challenge the jury instructions can be overcome if defense counsel \"simply ... inform[s] the trial court that he has not raised a constitutional challenge to the charge\n   <em>\n    because he is unaware of any such claim\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    and not because he has elected to waive the claim\n   </em>\n   .\" (Emphasis in original.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   , supra, 299 Conn. at 541,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"656\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20A.3d%20942\">\n    10 A.3d 942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\n   <em>\n    Palmer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    J.\n   </em>\n   , concurring). I continue to believe that such a statement by defense counsel necessarily would defeat any inference that the defendant has in fact voluntarily waived his right to a properly instructed jury, and I would encourage the defense bar to test this theory.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-172\">\n   In\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   , the majority offered four arguments as to why, in its view, even an express statement that the defendant does not wish to waive any unpreserved instructional claims would be insufficient to overcome the presumption of implied waiver. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"657\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20A.3d%20942\">\n    id.,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at 485-88 n.25,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"658\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20A.3d%20942\">\n    10 A.3d 942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The majority in the present case reaffirms those arguments. For the reasons that follow, I continue to find the arguments of the majority at best unpersuasive and at worst deeply troubling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-173\">\n   The majority first argues that, if defense counsel is sincere in the statement that she is unaware of any constitutional defects in the court's charge, but such a defect does in fact exist, then counsel is necessarily ineffective and the habeas court provides the appropriate forum to address the problem. See\n   <extracted-citation index=\"659\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20A.3d%20942\">\n    id.,\n   </extracted-citation>\n   at 487 n.25,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"660\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20A.3d%20942\">\n    10 A.3d 942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . I already have explained why a habeas court\n   is not an adequate forum for resolving unpreserved jury instructional claims. More important, the argument that defense counsel who fails to identify any potential defect in a jury charge is ineffective is (1) wholly irrelevant to the issue of whether the defendant should be deemed to have knowingly waived a claim of which he and his counsel are unaware, and (2) contrary to well established law.

There is no need to panic. What I am advocating is simply that we return to our pre-\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   jurisprudence, pursuant to which the parties are encouraged to collaborate with the trial court in the drafting of legally accurate jury instructions and a criminal defendant is deemed to have waived a claim when the record suggests that defense counsel was aware of the claim and failed to raise it for reasons of strategy or judgment, but claims of constitutional magnitude are otherwise reviewable under\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   . There was no deluge of unpreserved jury instructional claims back then, and there is no reason to fear that there will be one now if counsel merely circumvents the new\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   rule by honestly attesting that the fictional assumptions on which\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   relies are untrue in her client's case.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-176\">\n   Lastly, the majority in\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   indicated that such a statement by defense counsel \"would conflict directly with the mandate in rule 1.1 of the Rules of Professional Conduct that requires adequate preparation by counsel in representing a client, which presumably would include sufficient familiarity with the jury instructions to identify instructions that are constitutionally flawed.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"680\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20A.3d%20942\">\n    Id.\n   </extracted-citation>\n   The majority in the present case doubles down on this alarming statement, cautioning that \"such\n   conduct [also] would be inconsistent with our rules of practice, which seek to encourage good faith participation by counsel in the formulation of jury instructions.\" I find the majority's thinly veiled threats against defense counsel very concerning. It is preposterous to suggest that a commissioner of the Superior Court who, having engaged fully in a charging conference, merely and honestly informs the trial court that (1) she has thoroughly reviewed and considered its draft jury charge, (2) she is not aware of any constitutional defects other than those that she has articulated, but (3) her client does not\n   wish to waive any challenges that might later become apparent (if, for instance, a federal court were subsequently to deem one of the instructions unconstitutional), thereby violates the rules of practice and exposes herself to charges of professional misconduct. The majority may, of course, disagree with me as to the legal implications of such an attestation with respect to overcoming the presumption of implied waiver. Under no circumstances, however, is it appropriate for this court to bullyrag a legal professional who, in the course of zealously defending her client, happens to expose the fact that the\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   emperor has no clothes.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-177\">\n   E\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-178\">\n   Stare Decisis\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-179\">\n   Lastly, I am not persuaded by the state's argument that stare decisis, or respect for judicial precedent, requires adherence to\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   .

Although the parties read the history of our\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   jurisprudence differently, there is no dispute that the rules we have adopted to govern the review of unpreserved claims have evolved over the past several decades as we have sought to balance the various considerations discussed in part I C of this opinion.

These considerations include (1) securing the fundamental constitutional rights of criminal defendants, (2) maintaining an orderly trial process in which potential errors are identified and remedied in a timely manner, (3) disposing of meritless appellate claims as efficiently as possible, (4) treating with fairness both the trial court and the state, and (5) providing an opportunity for appellate courts to clarify and develop the law outside the \"the hurried and ... hectic process of trial ....\"\n   <em>\n    People\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ladas\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2779844\" index=\"693\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/ill-2d/12/290/#p294\">\n    12 Ill.2d at 294\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"694\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=146%20N.E.2d%2057\">\n    146 N.E.2d 57\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The legislative and executive branches of government, which have their own considerations to balance, routinely and appropriately tweak their practices and procedures\n   so as to best manage their affairs and conduct the business of the people.\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   is of the same ilk, and there is no reason why our commitment to maintaining stability and predictability in the law should require that, as an institution of government, we bind ourselves to unserviceable rules of procedure. Like the political branches, this court must have the freedom and flexibility not only to experiment with new procedures, but also to set such experiments aside when time and experience have proven them to be unworkable and ill conceived.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-181\">\n   The second reason stare decisis does not require that we retain the\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   rule is because there are no reliance interests that would justify the retention of\n   that rule in the face of its evident deficiencies. The only conceivable detrimental reliance on\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   would occur if the state, in other cases presently on appeal, had opted not to respond to appellants' unpreserved claims of instructional error on the merits and instead argued only that those claims were waived under\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   . If there are examples of this sort of reliance, any unfairness may be remedied simply by affording the state an additional opportunity to brief the unpreserved claims on the merits (or to argue that the claims are unreviewable on a ground unrelated to the\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   rule).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-182\">\n   Third, and most important, we are not bound to retain the\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   rule because not only was\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   wrongly decided in a such a way as to work a manifest injustice on criminal defendants whose constitutional rights have been violated and who had no intention of waiving those rights, but the rule also does irreparable damage to our broader waiver jurisprudence. As I explained in part I B of this opinion, the concept of waiver is fundamental not only in the context of criminal procedure but in virtually every area of the law. By muddying the concept in\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   , and by further confusing the issue in the present case, the majority risks infecting broad swaths of the law that rely on a clear and cogent distinction between waiver and forfeiture. Ultimately, in continuing to add epicycles to\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   in an attempt to salvage its flawed implied waiver theory, the majority itself implicitly acknowledges that the case is devoid of any precedential value.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-183\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-184\">\n   THE DEFENDANT'S CLAIM IS UNREVIEWABLE\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-185\">\n   Applying the foregoing principles to the present case, I would conclude, contrary to the majority, that defense counsel did not implicitly waive the jury instruction claims that the defendant raises on appeal. There is\n   absolutely no indication in the record that defense counsel was aware of the alleged errors but declined to object to them for strategic or other reasons. I agree with the defendant that there is no conceivable reason why, in a case that hinged on a contested eyewitness identification, it would have been beneficial to him not to seek a jury instruction that fully and accurately stated the considerations that might have called the reliability of the eyewitness testimony into doubt. Nor is there any indication, let alone unequivocal evidence, that defense counsel intended to waive the defendant's procedural right to raise such claims on appeal. Accordingly, the state has failed to meet its burden of proving that defense counsel, or the defendant himself, knowingly and voluntarily waived the claims at issue in this appeal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-186\">\n   Although I do not believe that the defendant's unpreserved jury instruction claims were waived or induced, I nevertheless agree with the state that they are unreviewable under\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   . The defendant's claims are that the trial court, in drafting its instructions with respect to eyewitness identification, incorporated certain of the Judicial Branch's standard\n   criminal jury instructions that favored the state but omitted those standard instructions that would have supported a defense of misidentification.

As the foregoing test indicates, federal plain error review differs from Connecticut's highly restrictive plain error doctrine; see footnote 6 of this concurring opinion; and is more closely analogous to this state's\n    <em>\n     Golding\n    </em>\n    review.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-237\">\n    I disagree with the majority that it is appropriate to have fewer jury instructional claims reviewable under our state waiver rule than under federal waiver doctrine, because relief for a proven violation is more automatic under\n    <em>\n     Golding\n    </em>\n    than under federal plain error review, which provides for discretionary relief. It is axiomatic that\n    <em>\n     Golding\n    </em>\n    review is limited to claims of constitutional magnitude, whereas federal plain error review is available for nonconstitutional claims as well. Accordingly, it stands to reason that more automatic relief should follow under\n    <em>\n     Golding\n    </em>\n    , because it necessarily will apply to a smaller universe of more egregious claims.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"15\">\n   <p id=\"p-238\">\n    Our case law permits juries to draw reasonable and logical inferences from the evidence presented at trial, and disallows them from engaging in speculation and conjecture.\n    <em>\n     State\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Morrill\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"557010\" index=\"783\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/193/602/#p608\">\n     193 Conn. 602\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 608,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"784\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=478%20A.2d%20994\">\n     478 A.2d 994\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1984). I believe that appellate courts should operate within the same parameters. It does not reasonably and logically follow from defense counsel's global review of a set of jury instructions, and general consent thereto, that he or she was aware of all potential flaws in the instructions and decided to disregard them. Conversely, when defense counsel's attention is drawn to a specific instruction, and he or she thereafter expresses satisfaction with that instruction, an inference that counsel agreed to the instruction, despite knowledge of some irregularity in it, is a much more reasonable inference.\n   </p>\n   <p id=\"p-239\">\n    Relatedly, I disagree with the majority that implying a broad waiver of claims of instructional error, both known and unknown, pursuant to\n    <em>\n     Kitchens\n    </em>\n    is analogous to a defendant's abandonment of various claims in connection with his or her waiver of other constitutional rights, specifically, the rights to a trial, counsel or a probable cause hearing. In each of the latter three instances, a criminal defendant overtly and consciously chooses to relinquish claims, known or unknown, in exchange for something he or she values-a favorable plea, the right to self-representation or a strategic advantage, respectively. This is unquestionably true, notwithstanding the majority's assessment of the benefit received, in the case of a waiver of counsel, as negligible, or its focus on what a defendant subject to a\n    <em>\n     Kitchens\n    </em>\n    waiver retains rather than on that which he or she has forfeited. In contrast, with an\n    <em>\n     implied\n    </em>\n    waiver pursuant to\n    <em>\n     Kitchens\n    </em>\n    , the defendant is\n    <em>\n     presumed\n    </em>\n    , by operation of law, to have abandoned a valuable right to appeal, not in exchange for something, but by merely agreeing to the proposed jury instructions. In my view, when a waiver is to be implied from circumstances and is not the result of any conscious quid pro quo, the scope of that waiver should be restrictive rather than broad.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"16\">\n   <p id=\"p-240\">\n    Conceivably, in a particular case, counsel may agree with a specific jury instruction, after discussion of that instruction with the trial court, yet still be unaware of a defect therein. In such an instance, a claim relating to that defect, although deemed waived on appeal, in actuality was only forfeited. Even under those circumstances, however, I do not believe that it is fundamentally unfair to deny direct appellate review of the claim pursuant to\n    <em>\n     Golding\n    </em>\n    , particularly in light of the competing consideration of avoiding an ambuscade of the trial court and opposing counsel. As we explained in\n    <em>\n     Kitchens\n    </em>\n    , there are features unique to jury instructions that justify holding counsel to a higher standard of accountability for failing to preserve claims of error. See\n    <em>\n     State\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Kitchens\n    </em>\n    , supra, 299 Conn. at 482-85,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"785\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20A.3d%20942\">\n     10 A.3d 942\n    </extracted-citation>\n    . Specifically, jury instructions are carefully formulated outside of the rush of trial pursuant to the rules of practice that afford counsel a large degree of participation in a structured process. The purpose of these rules is to detect error at the earliest possible juncture, and the threat of an implied waiver of an instructional claim on appeal, at least in narrowly defined circumstances, provides an appropriate incentive for the opportunity to be taken seriously.

Forfeiture thus occurs as a matter of course if an objection is not timely raised, whereas waiver requires an actual informed decision not to press the right. Although we have not always used these terms with the appropriate precision, our\n    <em>\n     Golding\n    </em>\n    jurisprudence is premised on the distinction between them. Specifically, we long have held that, whereas most claims of error that are not timely raised at trial are deemed to be forfeited and, thus, not reviewable on appeal, unpreserved claims of constitutional magnitude are reviewable, assuming all of the\n    <em>\n     Golding\n    </em>\n    requirements are satisfied, unless the defendant or defense counsel voluntarily chooses to waive them.

It is true that the induced error doctrine assumes that the defendant has made a strategic choice and that it holds him to the consequences of that choice. But there is no fiction therein-requesting a particular jury instruction is necessarily an exercise of trial strategy, regardless of the reason or purpose for the request-and we have made a policy determination that\n    <em>\n     Golding\n    </em>\n    review should not be available if the defendant later second-guesses that strategy and seeks to attack his own proposed instructions. The court in\n    <em>\n     Kitchens\n    </em>\n    likewise could have carved out for policy reasons a broader exception to\n    <em>\n     Golding\n    </em>\n    review for unpreserved jury instruction challenges when defense counsel merely acquiesces in the trial court's instructions. Its primary misstep was that, rather than being seen as further scaling back on\n    <em>\n     Golding\n    </em>\n    review, the\n    <em>\n     Kitchens\n    </em>\n    majority tried to piggyback on the doctrine of waiver by improperly labeling as implied waiver conduct that (1) often is not at all strategic, and (2) satisfies none of the criteria for a knowing, voluntary relinquishment of a fundamental right. The irony-and the fundamental slight-of-hand in\n    <em>\n     Kitchens\n    </em>\n    -is that it is precisely those elements of a true waiver, which exempt it from\n    <em>\n     Golding\n    </em>\n    review, that are lacking in a so-called\n    <em>\n     Kitchens\n    </em>\n    waiver.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"11\">\n   <p id=\"p-253\">\n    \"The doctrine of judicial estoppel ... advances notions of fair play by precluding a party from inducing judicial action by taking one legal position and then taking a contrary position later to achieve further advantage over the same adverse party.\"\n    <em>\n     State\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Hargrove\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12416314\" index=\"866\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan-app-2d/48/522/#p554\">\n     48 Kan.App.2d 522\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 548-49,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12416314\" index=\"867\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/kan-app-2d/48/522/#p554\">\n     293 P.3d 787\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2013).\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"12\">\n   <p id=\"p-254\">\n    See, e.g.,\n    <em>\n     State\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Rodriguez\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     -\n    </em>\n    <em>\n     Roman\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4088232\" index=\"868\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/297/66/#p86\">\n     297 Conn. 66\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 86,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"869\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=3%20A.3d%20783\">\n     3 A.3d 783\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2010) (unpreserved instructional claim was reviewable when \"defense counsel generally acquiesced in the jury instructions but did not affirmatively request the instruction\");\n    <em>\n     State\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Ebron\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4145702\" index=\"870\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/292/656/#p681\">\n     292 Conn. 656\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 680,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"871\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=975%20A.2d%2017\">\n     975 A.2d 17\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2009) (claim was reviewable \"because the defendant, while acquiescing to the charge as given at trial, did not actively induce the trial court to act on the challenged portion of the instruction\"), overruled in part by\n    <em>\n     State\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Kitchens\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4343690\" index=\"872\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/299/447/#p482\">\n     299 Conn. 447\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"873\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20A.3d%20942\">\n     10 A.3d 942\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2011) ;\n    <em>\n     State\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Madigosky\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5764793\" index=\"874\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/291/28/\">\n     291 Conn. 28\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 35 n.7,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"875\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=966%20A.2d%20730\">\n     966 A.2d 730\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2009) ( \"[t]here was no induced instructional error ... because the defendant had not submitted a request to charge or suggested any instructional language\" [internal quotation marks omitted] );\n    <em>\n     State\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Griggs\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3714189\" index=\"876\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/288/116/\">\n     288 Conn. 116\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 126-27 n.13,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"877\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=951%20A.2d%20531\">\n     951 A.2d 531\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2008) (mere acquiescence does not bar\n    <em>\n     Golding\n    </em>\n    review); see also\n    <em>\n     State\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Williams\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"498015\" index=\"878\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/202/349/#p363\">\n     202 Conn. 349\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 363,\n    <extracted-citation index=\"879\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=521%20A.2d%20150\">\n     521 A.2d 150\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1987) (\"[t]his court has consistently held that a claim that the judge improperly instructed the jury on an element of an offense is appealable even if not raised at trial\").\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"13\">\n   <p id=\"p-255\">\n    For this reason, the majority is simply incorrect when it contends that overruling\n    <em>\n     Kitchens\n    </em>\n    also would require that we overrule those decisions.

would be disturbing indeed if the majority, having rejected the \"cynical\" view that a state's attorney might allow an instructional error to go unnoticed in order to obtain a strategic advantage; footnote 18 of the majority opinion; were to adopt an equally cynical presumption regarding the conduct of defense counsel.\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"36\">\n   <p id=\"p-278\">\n    If the majority is truly concerned that many unpreserved claims of instructional error are the result of secret strategic plans that are not apparent from the trial court record, then those concerns easily can be addressed simply by requiring that appeals alleging instructional error be accompanied by an affidavit by trial counsel stating that she was unaware of the alleged defects at the time of trial and that the defendant did not intend to waive any objections thereto. Cf. General Statutes \u00a7 52-190a (a) (attorney filing medical malpractice action must attach certificate stating that reasonable inquiry gave rise to good faith belief that grounds exist for action against each defendant). In the event that the state had cause to question the veracity of such a representation, the matter could be remanded to the trial court to make the necessary findings. See Practice Book \u00a7 60-2 (9) ; see also\n    <em>\n     Henry\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Mississippi\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11731118\" index=\"1035\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/379/443/#p449\">\n     379 U.S. 443\n    </extracted-citation>\n    , 449-53,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11731118\" index=\"1036\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/379/443/#p449\">\n     85 S.Ct. 564\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"11731118\" index=\"1037\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/379/443/#p449\">\n     13 L.Ed.2d 408\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (1965). Such a procedure would allow any necessary factual determinations to be made by the court that tried the case, which is in the best position to assess whether the decisions of counsel were intentional and strategic, and dispense with the need for this court to engage in fact-finding functions for which it is ill-suited, or for a second, costly trial before a habeas court. And it would ensure that criminal defendants are not unfairly deprived of their constitutional right to a properly instructed jury solely on the basis of a presumption with little basis in reality regarding an error for which the defendant himself is almost certainly blameless.

Moreover, I am not persuaded by the state's argument that\n    <em>\n     Golding\n    </em>\n    predated the era of in-depth charging conferences and, therefore, did not account for the importance of encouraging full participation in such conferences by both parties. In fact, our cases from that time period reflect that we recognized both the existence and the importance of collaborative charging conferences but that we placed a higher priority on ensuring that unwaived constitutional violations did not go unaddressed.
