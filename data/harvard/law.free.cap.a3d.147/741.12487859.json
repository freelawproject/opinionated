On appeal the plaintiff claims that it was improper for the commissioner (1) to deny his request for lumbar fusion surgery, (2) to fail to consider the conflicting opinions of medical experts, and (3) to decline to order a commissioner's medical examination, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-294f (a). We affirm the decision of the board.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   Pursuant to a formal hearing held on July 23, 2014, the commissioner found the following facts in his finding and dismissal dated December 15, 2014. The plaintiff sustained compensable injuries to his neck, back, shoulder, leg and hand during the course of his employment with the defendant, Stanley Black and Decker.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In his finding and award dated January 7, 2011, the commissioner found that the plaintiff had sustained injuries to his right knee and left shoulder, but denied the plaintiff's claim for a psychiatric injury and total disability benefits. In addition, the commissioner found that the plaintiff's pain management treatment with Jonathan Kost, medical director of the pain treatment center at Hartford Hospital, was reasonable and necessary and\n   ordered the defendant to authorize treatment with Kost. The plaintiff treated with Kost from October, 2006, until the formal hearing. Kost's medical records indicate that the plaintiff continued to complain of pain in multiple parts of his body.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   On December 14, 2012, to address the plaintiff's continued complaints of pain, Kost discussed with the plaintiff possible treatment options, including a spinal cord stimulator\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   and a surgical consult. Kost referred the plaintiff to Andrew Wakefield, a neurosurgeon, for a neurosurgical consult, which was conducted on September 19, 2013. Wakefield and his physician assistant, Sean T. Brennan, noted in a report that the plaintiff was not a surgical candidate and that he was unable to find any objective evidence to explain the level of the plaintiff's complaints.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   Kost recommended that the plaintiff undergo an electromyography nerve conduction test to determine whether he was a candidate for a spinal cord stimulator. The test was conducted on February 20, 2014; the results of the test were normal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   At the request of the defendant, the plaintiff was examined by Jerrold Kaplan, a physiatrist. Kaplan opined that the plaintiff's pain management was not curative, and he did not recommend a spinal cord stimulator for the plaintiff. He instead recommended that the plaintiff undergo the comprehensive pain management program at the Rosomoff Center in Florida. On April 18, 2014, Kost agreed with Kaplan that the plaintiff was not a candidate for a spinal cord stimulator and that\n   the\n   plaintiff should undergo treatment at the Rosomoff Center.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   The plaintiff referred himself to Joseph Aferzon, a neurosurgeon, who examined him on April 30, 2014. Aferzon opined that the plaintiff should undergo a discogram\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   and spinal fusion\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   at the L5-S1, and possibly L4-5, level. On June 16, 2014, Kost recommended that the plaintiff delay treatment at Rosomoff Center pending a discogram and spinal fusion.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At the formal hearing, the plaintiff contended that, on the basis of the opinions and recommendations of Kost and Aferzon, he had sustained his burden of proof regarding his need for medical treatment, including ongoing pain management, a discogram, and lumbar fusion. The defendant argued, on the basis of the opinions of Wakefield and Kaplan, that the plaintiff had failed to sustain his burden of proof that he is entitled to ongoing medical treatment, including pain management, a discogram, and lumbar fusion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The commissioner found on the basis of the evidence produced that Wakefield's and Kaplan's opinions were more persuasive than those of Kost and Aferzon regarding the plaintiff's need for a spinal stimulator and lumbar spine surgery. He also found Kaplan's recommendation that the plaintiff undergo treatment\n   at the Rosomoff Center to be more persuasive than Kost's proposed treatment plan. Moreover, the commissioner found that although Kost's pain management treatment might or might not be curative, it enabled the plaintiff to function and was reasonable and necessary. Therefore, the commissioner denied the plaintiff's request for a spinal cord stimulator and for lumbar fusion surgery, and dismissed those claims. The commissioner authorized the plaintiff's claim that he undergo treatment at the Rosomoff Center. The commissioner ordered the defendant to be responsible for all reasonable and necessary costs associated with the plaintiff's need for ongoing pain management with Kost.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Thereafter, the plaintiff filed a petition for review by the board. In his appeal, the plaintiff stated that he saw other physicians to whom he was referred by his primary care physician due to what he claimed were inconsistent \"results\" mong the opinions of Wakefield, Kaplan, and Kost.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The board issued its opinion on August 12, 2015. It was not persuaded by the plaintiff's arguments that the commissioner's\n   decision was legally erroneous. The board concluded, essentially, that the plaintiff's claims constituted a dispute between physicians as to the optimal manner in which to treat the plaintiff's complaints of pain, i.e., the plaintiff and the defendant each presented differing treatment alternatives to the commissioner. The commissioner found the opinions of the defendant's experts to be more persuasive. As an appellate panel, the board stated that it was not permitted to\n   second-guess the commissioner. In addition, the board disagreed with the plaintiff that the commissioner was obligated to order a commissioner's examination of the plaintiff under \u00a7 31-294f. The board, therefore, affirmed the commissioner's finding and dismissal.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   The plaintiff appealed to this court, claiming that the decision of the board should be reversed because the commissioner did not grant his request for a spinal cord stimulator and lumbar fusion surgery. He also claims that it was error for the commissioner not to order a commissioner's examination to resolve the dispute between the conflicting medical opinions as to the need for lumbar fusion surgery.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Before addressing the plaintiff's claims, we set forth the applicable standard of review. \"A party aggrieved by a commissioner's decision to grant or deny an award may appeal to the board pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 31-301.... The appropriate standard applicable to the board when reviewing a decision of a commissioner is well established. [T]he review [board's] hearing of an appeal from the commissioner is not a de novo hearing of the facts .... [I]t is oblig[ated] to hear the appeal on the record and not retry the facts ....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   \"Similarly, on appeal to this court, [o]ur role is to determine whether the review [board's] decision results from an incorrect application of the law to the subordinate facts or from an inference illegally or unreasonably drawn from them .... [Therefore, we ask] whether the commissioner's conclusion can be sustained by the underlying facts.\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Estate of Haburey\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Winchester\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=150%20Conn.%20App.%20699\">\n    150 Conn.App. 699\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 713,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=92%20A.3d%20265\">\n    92 A.3d 265\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=312%20Conn.%20922\">\n    312 Conn. 922\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=94%20A.3d%201201\">\n    94 A.3d 1201\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   \"The [commissioner] alone is charged with the duty of initially selecting the inference [that] seems most reasonable and his choice, if otherwise sustainable, may\n   not be disturbed by a reviewing court.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 714.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   It is well within the authority of the commissioner \"to choose which evidence he found persuasive and which evidence he found unpersuasive, and adjudicate the claim accordingly. As the fact finder, the commissioner may reject or accept evidence .... It is not the province of this court to second-guess the commissioner's factual determinations. [T]he trier of fact-the commissioner-was free to determine the weight to be afforded to [the] evidence .... This court, like the board, is precluded from substituting its judgment of that of the commissioner with respect to factual determinations.\" (Citations omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.) Id., 717.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   We thoroughly have reviewed the record and the decisions of the commissioner and the board. We agree with the board that it was bound to accept the commissioner's decision as to the medical evidence he found more persuasive. The medical opinions provided by Wakefield and Kaplan are probative evidence that lumbar fusion surgery was not recommended for the plaintiff. We therefore conclude that the board properly affirmed the\n   commissioner's finding and dismissal with respect to treatment of the plaintiff's lumbar spine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   We also agree with the board that \u00a7 31-294f\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   does not mandate that the commissioner order a commissioner's\n   examination when conflicting medical evidence is presented to the commissioner. The plaintiff's claim requires us to construe the statute. Statutory construction raises questions of law over which we exercise plenary review.\n   <em>\n    Cruz\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Montanez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5768042\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/294/357/#p367\">\n    294 Conn. 357\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 367,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=984%20A.2d%20705\">\n    984 A.2d 705\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009). \"When construing a statute, [o]ur fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature ....

The statute further defines the circumstances under which such an examination is to take place and the consequences of a claimant's failure to comply. See footnote 7 of this opinion. The statute does not require the commissioner sua sponte to order a commissioner's examination to resolve conflicting evidence, although there is nothing in the statute to prohibit the commissioner from doing so.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   Because the commissioner in the present case was under no statutory duty to order a commissioner's examination, the plaintiff's claim to the contrary fails.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The decision of the Workers' Compensation Review Board is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-33\">\n    The record does not disclose the relation between Stanley Works, as the case is captioned, and Stanley Black and Decker.
