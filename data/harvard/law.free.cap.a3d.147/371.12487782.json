This case calls upon the Court to address the question of whether the funds in a bank account are \"money\" for purposes of Maryland's forfeiture statute, Md. Code Ann., Crim. Proc.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   (2001, 2008 Repl. Vol., 2016 Supp.)\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   (\"CP\") 12-101 to 12-505.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   In this case, the answer to that question is determinative of whether the forfeiting authority timely filed a complaint for forfeiture within the deadline set forth in CP 12-304. Specifically, we must decide whether funds contained in a bank account are \"money\" under CP 12-101(m)(1)(iv) of the forfeiture statute, and whether the forfeiting authority timely filed a complaint for forfeiture of that bank account. We hold that the funds contained in a bank account are \"money\" for purposes of the forfeiture statute under CP 12-101(m)(1)(iv), and are not a type of tangible or intangible personal property under CP 12-101(m)(1)(ii) ; we further hold that, in accordance with CP 12-304(c)(1), the forfeiting authority timely filed the complaint for forfeiture of the bank account within ninety days after the final disposition of the criminal proceedings arising out of the Controlled Dangerous Substances law, the deadline applicable to the filing of a complaint for forfeiture of money.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   <strong>\n    BACKGROUND\n   </strong>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On April 13, 2012, law enforcement officers of the Montgomery County Department of Police arrested Gianpaolo Bottini (\"Gianpaolo\"),\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   Petitioner, at his residence for illegal drug activity.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   Shortly after Gianpaolo's arrest, as part of their investigation and pursuant to a search warrant, law enforcement officers seized from Gianpaolo's residence, among other things, drug paraphernalia, items with suspected drug residue, tally sheets, Bank of America banking documents and statements, and United States currency in the amount of $5,610.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   Following his arrest, Gianpaolo was released on bond, and was scheduled to return to court on April 16, 2012, for further proceedings. On the morning of April 16, 2012, while free on bond and before appearing in court, Gianpaolo withdrew all of the money contained in two Bank of America bank accounts, titled in his name, totaling $64,388.33. On the same day and at the same time, that exact amount of money-$64,388.33-was deposited into a Bank of America bank account belonging to Gianpaolo's sister, Daniela Bottini (\"Daniela\"), Petitioner (together with Gianpaolo, \"Petitioners\"). The following day, April 17, 2012, Daniela wrote herself a check drawn on her Bank of America bank account, opened a bank account in her name only with Capital One, and deposited $63,891.93 into the Capital One bank account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On April 18, 2012, law enforcement officers obtained subpoenas for both of Gianpaolo's Bank of America bank accounts. At that time, law enforcement discovered that all of the money contained in Gianpaolo's Bank of America bank accounts had been withdrawn, and they traced the money to Daniela's Capital One bank account. On that same day, April 18, 2012, a law enforcement officer applied for a search and seizure warrant for Daniela's Capital One bank account. In the application, the law enforcement officer averred that law enforcement\n   had obtained wage records for Gianpaolo, which indicated that Gianpaolo had no reported income in the past year. Indeed, Gianpaolo had no legitimate source of income at all supporting the amount of money contained in his Bank of America bank accounts. This led law enforcement to believe that the money that was transferred from Gianpaolo's Bank of America bank accounts was either the direct proceeds of illegal drug transactions or illegal drug proceeds that had been commingled with legitimate funds.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   On April 18, 2012, a judge of the Circuit Court for Montgomery County (\"the circuit court\") issued a search and seizure warrant for the Capital One bank account. The following day, April 19, 2012, the Montgomery County Department of Police seized the Capital One bank account. On the same day, Montgomery County sent to Petitioners a \"Notice of\n   Money Seizure,\" advising them of its intent to petition for forfeiture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Approximately one year later, on May 10, 2013, Gianpaolo's criminal charges were resolved, when he was convicted and sentenced to twenty years' imprisonment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   On August 1, 2013, less than ninety days after the conclusion of the criminal proceedings, the Department of Finance of Montgomery County, Maryland (\"the County\"), Respondent, filed in the circuit court a Complaint Petition for Currency Forfeiture as to the Capital One bank account. On August 20, 2013, the County filed an Amended Complaint Petition for Currency Forfeiture. On September 27, 2013, Daniela filed an answer.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   In the meantime, on August 23, 2013, the circuit court issued a show cause order, ordering Gianpaolo and Daniela to appear before the circuit court on November 18, 2013. On November 18, 2013, the circuit court conducted a hearing. At the hearing, the circuit court treated Daniela's answer as a motion to dismiss. Specifically, in the answer, Daniela argued that the Capital One bank account was not \"money\" for purposes of the forfeiture statute, and that, as a result, the complaint for forfeiture was untimely filed. In the answer, Daniela argued that the bank account was intangible personal property and that the forfeiture statute required that a complaint seeking forfeiture of intangible personal property be filed ninety days after seizure. The County's complaint for forfeiture had been filed more than ninety days after seizure and would have been untimely under that theory. The circuit court rejected that argument and denied the motion to dismiss, orally ruling from the bench as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-19\">\n   Two issues before the Court. That wonderful [issue] of what is the definition of money. What constitutes money. And the second, definition as to whether the procedural requirements were, had been me[ ]t with respect to the\n   timing of the filing from the, under the statute, and the date of the complaint having been filed on August 1, 2013.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-20\">\n   With respect to the first argument, it brings to mind that old Potter Stewart ... line ... from the Supreme Court decision of trying to define obscenity and Justice Stewart's comment that, I don't know how to define obscenity, but I sure know it when I see it. I have the same application to money. I don't know, I don't know that I need the legislature to tell me what the definition of money is. I know that when I open on the screen an account and I look at my money, it may be in the bank, and I\n   guess technically the bank's holding it for me, but it's money. It better be there, it's my money.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-21\">\n   So, to suggest that an account in a bank is not money and therefore [there] would be a procedural defect in this case suggesti[ng] that we don't have (unintelligible) jurisdiction, this Court simply rejects. The amount that's in the account by anybody's definition, at least in this Court's definition, would constitute money.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-22\">\n   Secondly, the procedural requirement with regard to when the complaint has been filed. The Complaint was filed on August 1st[,] 2013, that is the date the Court looks to as to ascertain whether it was timely filed, it was, and the Motion to Dismiss is denied.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   After its oral ruling, and with the agreement of the parties, the circuit court set the case in for a trial on the merits.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On April 2, 2014, the circuit court conducted a trial. At trial, Daniela again argued that the Capital One bank account was not \"money\" and that the complaint for forfeiture was untimely filed. At the conclusion of the trial, the circuit court again rejected that argument, explaining, in pertinent part:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-25\">\n   The Court, in this case, finds that the intent of the legislature was to treat the designation of money, not simply to be as currency, meaning fungible cash, as argued by [d]efense counsel, but, rather, proceeds which are in a liquid state in the sense that they are funds on deposit subject to the call of the owner of those funds.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-26\">\n   So, I'm making a determination that, in this case, the funds which originally were deposited to two Bank of America accounts of Gianpaolo Bottini, which were cashed in on the morning of a court appearance of April 16, 2013, from Account No. 8612, in the amount of $56,009.78, and on Account ending in 5676 for $8,378.55 that those liquidations, which were then made into cashier's checks, which, ultimately, were deposited to a Bank of America account of Daniela Bottini, and then, ultimately, transferred to a Capital One account of Daniela Bottini, within a couple days of the termination of those accounts by Gianpaolo Bottini that those funds are money within the meaning of the statute. Therefore, the period of time for which the forfeiture must be filed is the 90 days after termination of the criminal action.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The circuit court ruled that only Gianpaolo had any right, title, or claim to the funds in the Capital One bank account, and that Daniela had no right, title, or claim to the funds, stating:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-28\">\n   I am satisfied that, in this case, where Daniela Bottini judicially admitted, in response to the Court's question, that the funds were transferred to her as an accommodation for designated purposes, that they were not a gift from her brother, that they were not a loan from her brother to her, but for identified purposes of paying lawyers, caring for parents, and things of that nature, that, in essence, [Gianpaolo] did not surrender in that manner his interest in the funds, [the circuit court], therefore, find[s] that, other than being the titled owner, Daniela Bottini, the claimant in this case, does not have any interest in these funds, and, therefore, I decline to allow her any part or portion of these funds.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The circuit court pointed out, however, that Gianpaolo had one year from the date of his criminal conviction to file an answer to the complaint for forfeiture and to assert a claim to the funds in the Capital One bank account. Thus, the circuit court denied Daniela's claim, but declined to rule on Gianpaolo's claim until a year had\n   passed from Gianpaolo's criminal conviction,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , until the time for Gianpaolo to file an answer and claim to the funds had expired. On April 10, 2014, the circuit court issued an order consistent with its oral ruling.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   On May 8, 2014, prior to the expiration of the one-year period, Gianpaolo filed an answer and a request for a hearing. On August 21, 2014, the circuit court conducted a trial. At the conclusion of the trial, the circuit court found that the funds in the Capital One bank account constituted illegal drug proceeds, and, therefore, granted forfeiture of the entire amount. On that same day, the circuit court issued an order, in which it mandated \"that the $63,891.83 in currency, which is the subject of this forfeiture petition, be and is hereby forfeited to [the] County[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   Thereafter, Gianpaolo filed a motion for new trial or, in the alternative, a motion to alter or amend the judgment, and the circuit court denied the motion.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   Petitioners noted an appeal to the Court of Special Appeals. In an unreported opinion, a majority of the panel of the Court of Special Appeals affirmed the judgment of the circuit court. Specifically, the majority held that the funds in the Capital One bank account are \"money\" for purposes of the forfeiture statute, and that, accordingly, the complaint for forfeiture was timely filed. In a dissent, on the other hand, one member of the panel disagreed that the Capital One bank account constituted \"money\" for purposes of the forfeiture statute, and instead would have concluded that the bank account is a contractual interest, claim, or right-\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , intangible personal property-and that, as such, the complaint for forfeiture was untimely filed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Petitioners thereafter filed a petition for a writ of\n   <em>\n    certiorari\n   </em>\n   , which this Court granted on February 19, 2016.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ?\n   <em>\n    Bottini v.

We do so on the tacit theory that the General Assembly is presumed to have meant what it said and said what it meant. When the statutory language is clear, we need not look beyond the statutory language to determine the General Assembly's intent. If the words of the statute, construed according to their common and everyday meaning, are clear and unambiguous\n   and express a plain meaning, we will give effect to the statute as it is written. In addition, we neither add nor delete words to a clear and unambiguous statute to give it a meaning not reflected by the words that the General Assembly used or engage in forced or subtle interpretation in an attempt to extend or limit the statute's meaning. If there is no ambiguity in the language, either inherently or by reference to other relevant laws or circumstances, the inquiry as to legislative intent ends.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-43\">\n   If the language of the statute is ambiguous, however, then courts consider not only the literal or usual meaning of the words, but their meaning and effect in light of the setting, the objectives, and the purpose of the enactment under consideration. We have said that there is an ambiguity within a statute when there exist two or more reasonable alternative interpretations of the statute. When a statute can be interpreted in more than one way, the job of this Court is to resolve that ambiguity in light of the legislative intent, using all the resources and tools of statutory construction at our disposal.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-44\">\n   If the true legislative intent cannot be readily determined from the statutory language alone, however, we may, and often must, resort to other recognized indicia-among other things, the structure of the statute, including its title; how the statute relates to other laws; the legislative history, including the derivation of the statute, comments and explanations regarding it by authoritative sources during the legislative process, and amendments proposed or added to it; the general purpose behind the statute; and the relative rationality and legal effect of various competing constructions.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-45\">\n   In construing a statute, we avoid a construction of the statute that is unreasonable, illogical, or inconsistent with common sense.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-46\">\n   In addition, the meaning of the plainest language is controlled by the context in which is appears. As this Court has stated, because it is part of the context, related statutes or a statutory scheme that fairly bears on the fundamental issue\n   of legislative purpose or goal must also be considered. Thus, not only are we required to interpret the statute as a whole, but, if appropriate, in the context of the entire statutory scheme of which it is a part.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   <em>\n    Wagner v.

According to Petitioners, a bank account is intangible personal property because Petitioners theorize that a bank depositor's property right vis-\u00e0 vis the bank is the intangible right to draw checks or make withdrawals against the bank's assets. Petitioners argue that a bank account cannot be money because, unlike money, which \"must have a physical location[,]\" a bank account has no physical location and consists only of the right to demand or negotiate value to a designated entity, either the depositor or someone else. Petitioners assert that the term \"money,\" as used in the forfeiture statute, is intended to apply only to physical, tangible greenbacks and coinage. Because Petitioners contend that a bank account is intangible personal property and not money, they argue that the County failed to timely file the complaint for forfeiture within ninety days after April 19, 2012, the date on which the Capital One bank account was seized, as required by statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-50\">\n   The County responds that, under the forfeiture statute, funds held in a bank account are money. The County contends that the term \"money\" refers equally to coins and paper bank notes used as cash and currency and to wealth generally. The County asserts that, considering the definitions of \"money\" and \"bank account\" together leads to the conclusion that a bank account holds or reflects the existence of money. The\n   County maintains that, based on the plain language of the term \"money\" and the intent of the General Assembly in enacting the forfeiture statute, a bank account is treated the same as money in forfeiture actions. Because the County contends that the bank account is money, the County argues that it timely filed the complaint for forfeiture within ninety days after the disposition of the criminal proceedings on the charges involving controlled dangerous substances, as required by statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-51\">\n   The concept of forfeiture is derived from English common law, and is \"grounded in the legal fiction that an inanimate object can be guilty of a crime[.]\"\n   <em>\n    Dir. of Fin. of Prince George's Cnty. v.

In other words, for purposes of the forfeiture statute, money is distinct from tangible and intangible personal property, as evidenced by the separate classification in CP 12-101(m)(1) and by the different deadline for filing a complaint for forfeiture of money\n   set forth in CP 12-304(c)(1). Although the forfeiture statute identifies seven types of tangible and intangible personal property,\n   <em>\n    see\n   </em>\n   ?CP 12-101(m)(1)(ii), the forfeiture statute does not specify what falls within the classification of \"money,\" nor does the forfeiture statute provide a separate definition for the term \"money.\" Under this circumstance, we turn to the \"natural and ordinary meaning\" of the term \"money.\"\n   <em>\n    Wagner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4365906\" index=\"24\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/445/404/#p417\">\n    445 Md. at 417\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4365906,4365962\" index=\"25\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/128/1/\">\n    128 A.3d at 9\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (citation omitted).

Money is used in a specific and also in a general and more comprehensive sense. In its specific sense, it means what is coined or stamped by public authority, and has its determinate value fixed by governments. In its more comprehensive and general sense, it means wealth.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-98\">\n   \"What is MONEY?,\" The Law Dictionary, http://www.thelawdictionary.org/money/ (citation omitted).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-99\">\n   These definitions demonstrate that the term \"money,\" defined in its most narrow sense, means coins and paper money used as cash and currency, and defined in a broader sense, means assets that can easily be converted to cash, or wealth. Thus, utilizing the ordinary definition of \"money\" above, it is clear that funds contained in a bank account-which certainly can be said to be a person's assets that can easily be converted to cash-constitute \"money.\" Put simply, the term \"money\" encompasses more than just physical currency in the form of coins and paper money, and extends to assets that can easily be converted to physical currency, or wealth, such as the funds contained in a bank account. We simply are not persuaded that the definition of the term \"money\" somehow precludes a determination that funds in a bank account are money, or that the term \"money\" as used in CP 12-304(c)(1) -providing that a complaint for forfeiture of money \"shall be filed within 90 days after the final disposition of criminal proceedings that arise out of the Controlled Dangerous Substances law\"-or in CP 12-101(m)(1)(iv), is meant to refer only to the narrowest sense of the term, namely, tangible coins and paper bills. Nothing in either CP 12-101(m)(1)(iv)'s or CP 12-304(c)(1)'s\n   plain language purports to limit the term \"money\" to coins and paper bills or to otherwise contradict the commonsense understanding of the term \"money.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-100\">\n   Notably, CP 12-101(m)(1) does not identify a \"bank account\" as a particular type of property, nor does the forfeiture statute provide a definition of the term \"bank account\" that somehow would exclude it from being classified as money. Accordingly, the forfeiture statute itself does not preclude our holding that funds in a bank account constitute money,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , nothing in CP 12-101(m)(1) or CP 12-304 dictates that funds in a bank account must be classified as some type of property other than money. This makes sense, because, as the County contended at oral argument, a bank account has no value in and of itself, separate and distinct from the money contained within it. In other words, a bank account itself is not property; rather, it is the funds, or money, contained within the bank account that constitute property that is subject to forfeiture.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-101\">\n   Our holding that funds in a bank account constitute money for purposes of the forfeiture statute under CP 12-101(m)(1)(iv), and correspondingly for purposes of the filing deadline contained in CP 12-304(c)(1), is also supported by the ordinary meaning of the terms \"account\" and \"bank account.\" Merriam-Webster defines an \"account,\" in pertinent part, as \"money deposited in a bank account and subject to withdrawal by the depositor[.]\" Account, Merriam-Webster (2015), http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/account [https://perma.cc/BF9G-ZECU]. And \"bank account\" has been defined as follows:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-102\">\n   A sum of money placed with a bank or banker, on deposit, by a customer, and subject to be drawn out on the lat[ ]ter's check. The statement or computation of\n   the several sums deposited and those drawn out by the customers on checks, entered on the books of the bank and the depositor's pass-book.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-103\">\n   \"What is BANK-ACCOUNT?,\" The Law Dictionary, http://www.thelawdictionary.org/bank-account/ (citation omitted). Considering the definition of the term \"bank account\" in\n   conjunction with the definition and commonsense understanding of the term \"money\" leads to the inescapable conclusion that a bank account holds or contains money and reflects the existence of money.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-104\">\n   This commonsense understanding of the terms \"money\" and \"bank account\" is consistent with how, in other contexts, this Court has used the term \"money\" to refer to funds that are deposited, withdrawn, and held within a bank account.\n   <em>\n    See, e.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Wagner\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4365906\" index=\"28\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/md/445/404/#p417\">\n    445 Md. at 421\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4365906,4365962\" index=\"29\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/128/1/\">\n    128 A.3d at 11\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (In a criminal case, this Court determined that the evidence was sufficient to support the trial court's finding that a defendant \"took and used the money in the [bank] Account for her own purposes and did so without [her] Father's knowledge or authorization [,]\" and that the defendant did not dispute the trial court's factual finding that she \"understood that the money in the [bank] Account belonged to [her] Father[.]\" (Brackets and internal quotation marks omitted));\n   <em>\n    Attorney Grievance Comm'n v.

In short, we conclude that the plain meaning of the term \"money,\" as used in CP 12-101(m)(1)(iv) and CP 12-304(c)(1), includes the funds contained in a bank account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-105\">\n   We do not find persuasive Petitioners' reliance on CP 12-102(b) and CP 12-202(b) for the contention that the term \"money\" in the forfeiture statute, including in CP 12-101(m)(1)(iv) and CP 12-304(c)(1), refers only to physical cash and currency. We shall address each statute in turn. At the\n   time of the forfeiture proceedings in this case, as to money or weapons that are found near controlled dangerous substances, CP 12-102(b) provided, in its entirety:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-106\">\n   (1)(i) Money or weapons that are found in close proximity to a contraband controlled dangerous substance, controlled paraphernalia, or forfeitable records of the importation, manufacture, or distribution of controlled dangerous substances are contraband and presumed to be forfeitable.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-107\">\n   (ii) A claimant of money or weapons has the burden to rebut the presumption.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-108\">\n   (2) All rights in, title to, and interest in the money or weapons immediately shall vest in:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-109\">\n   (i) the State, if the seizing authority was a State unit;\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-110\">\n   (ii) the county in which the money or weapons were seized, if the seizing authority was a county law enforcement unit, including a sheriff's office; or\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-111\">\n   (iii) the municipal corporation in which the money or weapons were seized, if\n   the seizing authority was a law enforcement unit of a municipal corporation.\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-112\">\n   (3) The money or weapons may be returned to the claimant only as this title provides.\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-113\">\n   Thus, at the time of the forfeiture proceedings in this case, CP 12-102(b)(1) narrowly pertained to \"[m]oney or weapons that [we]re found in close proximity to[,]\" among other things, contraband controlled dangerous substances or paraphernalia. As to money and weapons that were found in close proximity to drugs, there was a presumption that those items were forfeitable based solely on their physical location at the time of seizure; that presumption was rebuttable by a claimant. To be sure, CP 12-102(b)(1) concerned \"money\" in its narrowest sense,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , coins and paper bills, that were physically capable of being located near contraband at the time of seizure. Thus,\n   in that one respect, CP 12-102(b)(1) limited the term \"money.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-114\">\n   Significantly, nothing in CP 12-102(b)(1) purported to limit the definition of the term \"money\" in other locations in the forfeiture statute, and the term \"money\" is not qualified in CP 12-101(m)(1)(iv) or CP 12-304(c)(1) by the phrase \"found in close proximity\" as it was in CP 12-102(b)(1). Nor is money subject to forfeiture only if it was found in close proximity as was set forth in CP 12-102(b)(1). Indeed, money subject to forfeiture is described in CP 12-102(a) in a manner that makes it clear that money need not be paper bills or coins and physically able to be in close proximity to contraband.\n   <em>\n    See\n   </em>\n   ?CP 12-102(a)(6) (\"money of more than $300 ... used or intended to be used in connection with the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensing, or possession of a controlled dangerous substance or controlled paraphernalia\"); CP 12-102(a)(12) (\"everything of value furnished, or intended to be furnished, in exchange for a controlled dangerous substance in violation of the Controlled Dangerous Substances law, all proceeds traceable to the exchange ...\"). In short, although CP 12-102(b) refers to \"money\" that is found in a particular location,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , in close proximity to contraband, we see no reason as to why this circumstance limits the definition of money throughout the forfeiture statute. In other words, simply because \"money\" in CP 12-102(b) refers specifically to money that is found in close proximity to controlled dangerous substances, does not preclude money from having a broader meaning under the forfeiture statute.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-115\">\n   As to CP 12-202(b), concerning the photographing of contraband money, that subsection provides, in its entirety:\n  </p>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-116\">\n   The seizing authority that seizes money that is contraband shall immediately:\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-117\">\n   (1) photograph the contraband money and record the quantity of each denomination of coin or currency seized; and\n  </blockquote>\n  <blockquote id=\"p-118\">\n   (2) deposit the money to the account of the appropriate local financial authority.\n  </blockquote>\n  <p id=\"p-119\">\n   Commonsensically, to be photographed under CP 12-202(b), the money seized needs to be in a physical form capable of being photographed. As with former CP 12-102(b)(1), CP 12-202(b) appears to qualify the term \"money\" to refer to it in the narrowest and most physical sense-as \"coin or currency[.]\" That CP 12-202(b) qualifies the term \"money,\" however, does\n   not mean that the definition of the term \"money\" is so limited in other locations in the forfeiture statute, such as in CP 12-101(m)(1)(iv) or CP 12-304(c)(1), where the term \"money\" is not qualified or limited by a phrase such as \"coin or currency[.]\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-120\">\n   Notwithstanding Petitioners' contentions, we are unconvinced that funds in a bank account constitute tangible or intangible personal property under CP 12-101(m)(1)(ii), and specifically that a bank account is an interest, a claim, or a right as those terms are used in the forfeiture statute. Nor are we persuaded that funds in a bank account constitute a security under CP 12-101(m)(1)(ii) 1. As an initial matter, we observe that, at oral argument, Petitioners argued that the Capital One bank account constituted an interest, claim, or right under the forfeiture statute. However, on brief, Petitioners did not raise the specific argument that they raised at oral argument concerning a bank account being an interest, a claim, or a right; rather, on brief, Petitioners simply stated that a bank account constituted intangible personal property, and that a depositor retains \"the intangible right to draw checks or make withdrawals[.]\" In other words, the argument that a bank account constitutes an interest, claim, or right was raised in this Court at oral argument and was not briefed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-121\">\n   In any event, CP 12-101(m)(1)(iv) specifically differentiates money from an interest, claim, right, or security. To the extent that bank accounts may be similar in some regard to tangible or intangible personal property, we observe that the General Assembly has specifically identified securities, interests, claims, and rights as types of tangible or intangible personal property under CP 12-101(m)(1)(ii), but has not identified a bank account in a similar fashion, or even at all. To be sure, an individual has, in a very basic or colloquial sense, an interest,\n   claim, and right to the money contained in his or her bank account, but the same could be said as to money in any form,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , a person has an interest, claim, and right to money that they own, in whatever form it is in. This colloquial understanding that an individual has an interest, claim, or right to his or her money does not, however, control the meaning of these terms under CP 12-101(m)(1). In short, it is evident from the plain language of CP 12-101(m)(1) that the funds in a bank account constitute \"money\" under CP 12-101(m)(1)(iv) -and not some type of tangible or intangible personal property under CP 12-101(m)(1)(ii) ; and, as such, funds in a bank account are also \"money\" for purposes of the filing deadline set forth in CP 12-304(c)(1).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-122\">\n   Although the plain language of the forfeiture statute is unambiguous and our analysis could end at this point, we nonetheless point out that our holding is fully supported by the legislative history and purpose of the forfeiture statute. Indeed, a review of the forfeiture statute's legislative history reinforces the conclusion that the plain meaning of the term \"money\" in CP 12-101(m)(1)(iv) and CP 12-304(c)(1) includes the funds in a bank account. The legislative history of the forfeiture statute demonstrates that, in 1970, the General Assembly enacted a comprehensive controlled dangerous substances act for the purposes of, among other things, \"providing for a comprehensive set of schedules, regulations, offenses, and penalties for those substances which are classified as controlled dangerous substances, [and] providing a procedure for forfeiture of certain property under certain conditions[.]\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1970%20Md.%20Laws%20881\">\n    1970 Md.

Vol.), Art. 27, 276, concerning the purpose and construction\n   of the controlled dangerous substances act, which provided, in pertinent part: \"The General Assembly ... finds and declares that the illegal manufacture, distribution, possession, and administration of controlled dangerous substances have a substantial and detrimental effect on the health and general welfare of the people of the State of Maryland.\"\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=1970%20Md.%20Laws%20881\">\n    1970 Md.

As shown above, the forfeiture statute originally referred to \"money or currency,\" then \"money, coin, or currency,\" and finally just \"money,\" as it does\n   today. Notably, in the recodification of the forfeiture statute in the Criminal Procedure Article, the General Assembly dropped the references to \"coin\" and \"currency,\" and the forfeiture statute already referred to \"money.\" Significantly, the Revisor's Note for the recodification of the forfeiture statute states that the statute was new language derived without substantive change,\n   <em>\n    i.e.\n   </em>\n   , the General Assembly did not view deletion of the references to \"coin\" and \"currency\" to be substantive changes. In other words, the terms \"coin\" and \"currency\" were, in essence, redundant, and were encompassed by the term \"money.\" This demonstrates that the General\n   Assembly intended for the term \"money\" to be a broad term, as it had been since the original enactment of the forfeiture statute. Thus, the relevant legislative history of the forfeiture statute establishes that the term \"money\" certainly encompasses and applies to the funds contained in a bank account.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-151\">\n   And, before we move on, we reiterate the obvious point that the General Assembly could have identified a bank account and the funds contained in a bank account as a separate classification of property subject to forfeiture, or as a specific form of tangible or intangible personal property distinct from money, had it desired to do so.\n   <em>\n    Cf.\n   </em>\n   ?\n   <em>\n    Montgomery\n   </em>\n   ?\n   <em>\n    Cnty. v.

Absent any indication in the relevant statutory language or the legislative history that the General Assembly intended the term \"money\" to narrowly apply only to coins and paper bills, or for the funds in a bank account to constitute something other than \"money\" under CP 12-101(m)(1)(iv) and for purposes of the filing deadline in CP 12-304(c)(1), we decline to construe the forfeiture statute to reach such a strained result.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-152\">\n   Thus, having determined that funds in a bank account constitute \"money\" for purposes of the forfeiture statute, and that the funds in the Capital One bank account in this case\n   constitute money, we turn to whether the County timely filed the complaint for forfeiture of the Capital One bank account. As stated above, CP 12-304 sets forth the various deadlines for the filing of a complaint for forfeiture depending on the type of property at issue. Specifically, as to money, pursuant to CP 12-304(c)(1), the complaint for forfeiture must be filed \"within 90 days after the final disposition of criminal proceedings that arise out of the Controlled Dangerous Substances law.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-153\">\n   Because the funds in the Capital One bank account constitute money, the County was required to file a complaint for forfeiture within ninety days after the final disposition of the criminal proceedings related to Gianpaolo's charged violations of the Controlled Dangerous Substances law. The County did so. The final disposition of the criminal proceedings against Gianpaolo occurred on May 10, 2013, the date on which Gianpaolo was convicted and sentenced. The County had until August 8, 2013-ninety days after the final disposition of the criminal proceedings-to file a complaint for forfeiture of the Capital One bank account. On August 1, 2013, before the ninety-day deadline, the County filed in the circuit court the complaint for forfeiture of the Capital One bank account. We, therefore, conclude that the County timely filed the complaint for forfeiture, and that the circuit court and Court of Special Appeals correctly determined as much. As such, the money is, indeed, in the bank.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-154\">\n   <strong>\n    JUDGMENT OF THE COURT OF SPECIAL APPEALS AFFIRMED.

For example, when a customer opens an account at a bank, the account is subject to the bank's terms and conditions. These terms and conditions detail the rights and obligations of the bank and the customer, including service fees,\n   transfer and withdrawal limits, and limits on the availability of deposited funds. In exchange for depositing funds in a bank account, the customer, depending on the type of account, receives the ability to draw checks, transfer funds, pay bills electronically, and earn interest. In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation insures a bank account holder's deposits up to $250,000. In short, a bank account is a bundle of intangible, contractual rights.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-161\">\n   The Majority's reading of the statute also renders bank accounts \"functionally indistinguishable from other types of accounts that ... clearly would not fall within the definition of 'money.' \"\n   <em>\n    Bottini\n   </em>\n   , slip op. at 1 (Arthur, J., dissenting).

The Majority does not answer these questions, but instead offers a strained interpretation of the forfeiture statute that renders the term \"security\" in CP 12-101(m)(1) meaningless. If the funds in a bank account are \"money,\" as the Majority holds, the funds in a security would also be \"money,\" making the term \"security\" superfluous. This result runs contrary to our long-established rules of statutory construction.\n   <em>\n    E.g.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <em>\n    Blake v.

My construction of the statute seeks to further the statute's purpose while requiring the forfeiting authority to adhere to the statute's prescribed procedures.

Therefore, when pursuing forfeiture of a bank account, the forfeiting authority must file a petition \"within the earlier of (1) 90 days after the seizure; or (2) 1 year after the final disposition of the criminal charge for the violation giving rise to the forfeiture.\" CP 12-304(a).
