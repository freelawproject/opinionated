On appeal, the defendant claims that (1) the court improperly excused a juror before trial without first notifying the defendant or his counsel; (2) the court committed plain error concerning the constancy of accusation testimony at trial; and (3) the prosecutor engaged in impropriety in his cross-examination of the defendant and in closing argument. We affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   On the basis of the evidence presented at trial, the jury reasonably could have found the following facts. In 2003, the defendant began to sexually abuse his older daughter E.V., who was nine years old at the time. Over the next eight years, the defendant frequently subjected E.V. to various forms of sexual abuse, including forced vaginal penetration, attempted anal penetration, oral\n   sex, masturbation, and other sexual contact with her intimate parts.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   In addition to sexually abusing E.V., there was extensive testimony about the defendant regularly exposing E.V. and his younger daughter, K.V., to other forms of abuse that jeopardized their health and welfare. For example, the defendant was very possessive of E.V. and K.V., and he would inspect K.V. in the shower to ensure that she was a virgin, check E.V.'s body after school for hickeys, and dress both of the girls in boys clothing. He would also force E.V. and K.V. to consume alcohol. Finally, the defendant was prone to violent outbursts, and he would regularly physically abuse K.V. and occasionally physically abuse E.V. The defendant's violent, controlling, and, at times, paranoid behavior was often exacerbated by his use of crack cocaine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The events that led to the defendant's arrest were set in motion by two reports, made by E.V.'s and K.V.'s schools, to the Department of Children and Families (department) in 2011. While E.V. was enrolled in high school, the defendant would frequently require E.V. to stay home under the pretense of having her take care of the house so that he could sexually abuse her. In the fall of 2010, E.V. confided in a teacher, with whom she had taken classes throughout her four years of high school, that she often missed school because her father insisted that she stay home \"to take care of him, the house, and her little brother,\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   not because she was ill, as she had previously indicated. The teacher then notified the principal, school social worker and the school resource officer about the potential truancy issue. Over the next few\n   months, the school resource\n   officer spoke to E.V.'s parents about her absenteeism in an attempt to resolve the issue. When E.V.'s absenteeism persisted, the school resource officer contacted the department on March 3, 2011.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   That same day, K.V. arrived home late from school because the public bus she took home had broken down. When she arrived home, the defendant extensively beat her, leaving bruises on her faceand body, because she was late and he did not believe her excuse. On March 4, 2011, despite the visible bruising, K.V. went to school.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   At the urging of friends, K.V. went to the school counselor, who called the department. The department sent an investigator, Gloria Rodriguez, to interview K.V. about the potential physical abuse. Rodriguez was also provided with the report E.V.'s school had made about her absenteeism and potential educational neglect. After interviewing K.V. and her mother, M.V., Rodriguez suspected that E.V. was being sexually abused at home. When Rodriguez interviewed E.V., she directly asked her whether she was being sexually abused, and E.V. confirmed that she was being sexually abused by her father.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On February 3, 2014, a trial commenced on a ten count long form information, charging the defendant in eight counts for his sexual abuse of E.V. and in two counts for his sexual and nonsexual abuse of E.V. On February 10, 2014, the jury returned a guilty verdict on all counts. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The defendant first claims on appeal that the court improperly excused a regular juror before trial without first notifying the defendant or his counsel. Because the defendant failed to preserve this claim for appeal,\n   he seeks\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   review,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   arguing that the court violated his state and federal constitutional rights by excusing a juror without first notifying the defendant or his counsel. Alternatively, the defendant seeks reversal under the plain error doctrine, arguing that the trial court failed to \"articulate sufficient facts to support the conclusion that the juror was no longer able to perform her duties due to her diagnosis,\" as required by General Statutes \u00a7 54-82h (c). The state responds that both claims are unreviewable under\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   and do not warrant reversal under the plain error doctrine because the substitution of a regular juror for an alternate juror does not implicate a defendant's constitutional rights and the court complied with \u00a7 54-82h (c)when it dismissed the juror for good cause. We agree with the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   We first address the defendant's claim that the court violated his state and federal constitutional rights when it excused the juror without first notifying the defendant or his counsel.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant argues that\n   he was entitled to notice prior to the excusal of the juror on the basis of the right to individual voir dire under article first, \u00a7 19, of the Connecticut constitution, as amended by article four of the amendments; the right to counsel under the sixth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution; and the due process right to be present at all critical stages of a prosecution under the fifth and fourteenth amendments to the United States constitution.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   The defendant seeks\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   review. \"Under\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   , a defendant can prevail on a claim of constitutional error not preserved at trial only if the following conditions are met: (1) the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; (2) the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; (3) the alleged constitutional violation ... exists and ... deprived the defendant of a fair trial; and (4) if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt. In the absence of any one of these conditions, the defendant's claim will fail. The appellate tribunal is free, therefore, to respond to the defendant's claim by focusing on whichever condition is most relevant in the particular circumstances.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State v.

Instead, our Supreme Court has interpreted article first, \u00a7 19, as constitutionalizing only \"certain rights ... regarding the\n   <em>\n    selection\n   </em>\n   of individual jurors,\" namely, the right \"to challenge jurors peremptorily\" and the \"right of the parties to have counsel conduct individual\n   examinations of\n   <em>\n    prospective\n   </em>\n   jurors....\" (Emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Rozbicki v.

First, the defendant claims that the prosecutor improperly suggested that \"defendants in child sexual assault cases have an increased motive to lie for fear of being 'labeled' as a sex offender in jail.\" Second, the defendant argues that the prosecutor's remarks improperly appealed to the emotions and prejudices of the jurors by repeatedly\n   calling the defendant a \"sex offender.\" Finally, the defendant argues that the prosecutor improperly appealed to the emotions and prejudices of the jurors by encouraging them to find the defendant guilty because he was a \"bad person\" rather than on the basis of the evidence. We conclude that the prosecutor's remarks were not improper.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-72\">\n   The following additional facts are necessary to our resolution of these claims. During his closing argument, the prosecutor explained to the jurors that the case required them to assess the credibility of all of the witnesses, and he reviewed the evidence that corroborated various witnesses' testimony. Toward the end of his closing argument, the prosecutor made the following remarks:\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-73\">\n   \"But basically, for the sex assault, it comes down to E.V. and this defendant; so, you're going to have to compare their testimonies. Who is more credible? Okay?\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-74\">\n   \"E.V.: Obedient. Never lied. Honor student. We saw the way she testified. God-fearing, as he said, as he put a knife-as\n   she put a knife to her father where she almost had enough where she put a knife to his-his throat and said God won't forgive me if I did it. You have E.V. and that person.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-75\">\n   \"Person to person, who's always promised to change for years and years and years and never did. Similar to how he told E.V. after every time he penetrated her, I would stop. So, you have that person. You also have the person who would take the moneys-family's [social security disability] money for her son-for his son,\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   take the mom's employment money, take rent money, and spend it all on drugs.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-76\">\n   \"Also, [you] have a person impairing them, a person who continually beat [K.V.] for years-approximately seven years with his fists, his hands, his boots; hit her about the face, arms, legs, ribs, and stomach. More or less a person who never had a job. More or less a person who, for some reason-and I submit to you the reason was to be alone with her so she could sexually assault her-so he could sexually assault her-would keep her home from school; a person who lied to housing; who left [M.V.] with a $7000 bill; and also, a person who will be labeled a sex offender. So, with that said, ladies and gentlemen, I ask you: Who has the motive there to tell the truth?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-77\">\n   Defense counsel then addressed the jury and stated that the evidence \"should actually probably not be reviewed\" as it related to the defendant's testimony concerning the risk of injury to a child offenses charged in counts nine and ten of the information. He argued that while the defendant admitted to using crack, taking his family's money, and \"making his family's life hell,\" he was not admitting to sexually assaulting E.V. He urged the jury to focus on the credibility of the state's witnesses as it related to the sexual abuse offenses charged in counts one through eight of the information. In particular, he argued that E.V. had a motive to lie about being sexually abused by the defendant to protect herself and her sister from the defendant's physical abuse.\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-78\">\n   The prosecutor then began his rebuttal as follows: \"Motivation, I mean, no father wants to admit he sexually assaulted his daughter between the ages of nine\n   and sixteen. Let's face it, ladies and gentlemen, that's the motivation. You don't want to be labeled as a sex offender, okay?\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-79\">\n   As the alleged impropriety occurred during closing argument, we set forth the applicable legal principles. \"[P]rosecutorial [impropriety] of a constitutional magnitude can occur in the course of closing arguments.... [B]ecause closing arguments often have a rough and tumble quality about them, some leeway must be afforded to the advocates in offering arguments to the jury in final argument.

The state responds that the prosecutor was not attempting to inflame the passions of the jury, but rather the prosecutor was permissibly recalling the undisputed evidence presented at trial about the defendant's character to assist the jurors' assessment of the defendant's credibility. We agree with the state.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-91\">\n   Again, the critical issue relative to the claimed impropriety is whether the disputed remarks encouraged the jury to find the defendant guilty on the basis of emotion, rather than on a rational appraisal of the trial evidence, not simply whether the remarks might have painted a negative portrait of the defendant's character. Here, the prosecutor never suggested to the jury that because the evidence showed that the defendant was a bad person, he must have sexually assaulted his daughter. Instead, and just prior to the disputed remarks, the prosecutor acknowledged that the sexual assault charges boiled down to a credibility assessment of E.V. and the defendant. The prosecutor then proceeded to review, in a straightforward manner, the undisputed evidence presented at trial concerning both E.V.'s and the defendant's character. See\n   <em>\n    State v.
