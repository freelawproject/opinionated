We reverse the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following procedural history and facts, which the parties do not appear to dispute, are relevant to this appeal. In August, 2007, the plaintiff entered into a ten year commercial lease agreement (lease) with its tenant, Southbury Food Center of Connecticut, Inc. (Southbury Food). In the first paragraph of section 4 of the lease, the plaintiff and Southbury Food agreed that the base rent for the first four years of the lease would be $216,000 per year, payable in equal monthly installments of $18,000. In the second paragraph of section 4 of the lease, the plaintiff and Southbury Food further agreed that for the fifth year of the lease, the base rent would increase, and Southbury Food would pay as annual base rent the sum of $216,000, plus the\n   cumulative increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) over the previous four year period as issued by the United States Department of Labor (fifth year cumulative rent increase).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On May 14, 2012, which was nine months into the fifth year of the lease, the plaintiff, Southbury Food, and the defendant executed a lease assignment (assignment) pursuant to which the defendant replaced Southbury Food as the plaintiff's tenant under the lease.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In the preamble, the assignment contained several \"whereas\" clause provisions, the third of which provided as follows: \"WHEREAS; the [current] annual base rent for the period [of] September 1, 2011, to August 31, 2012, is [$216,000 (e.g., $18,000 per month) ] ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   The assignment further provided, in paragraph 5 of the body of the document, that the plaintiff \"is not in default pursuant to any [l]ease provision and [Southbury Food] is not in default of any [l]ease provision and remains current in the payment of all obligations thereunder ....\" A copy of the lease was attached to the assignment as exhibit A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   Contemporaneously with the execution of the assignment, the plaintiff and the defendant also executed a lease amendment (amendment), which amended, in\n   part, the lease originally entered into by the plaintiff and Southbury Food. At the time the amendment was executed, nine months of the fifth year of the lease had elapsed. The amendment modified the base rent calculation commencing in the sixth year of the lease as follows: \"With respect to Section 4\n   <em>\n    BASE RENTAL\n   </em>\n   ... of the [l]ease, the third paragraph therein shall be deleted and replaced with the following: 'Thereafter, the base rental for each year shall increase by 2.5% over the immediately preceding year's base rental and shall be payable in twelve equal monthly installments on the first day of each month without any prior demand, deduction or setoff whatsoever.' \" Thus, the rental increases after the fifth year of the lease would no longer track the CPI. The amendment made no other changes to section 4 of the lease and specifically provided that \"[e]xcept as provided hereinabove, the remaining terms and conditions of the lease shall remain unmodified and in full force and effect.\" The amendment did not alter the fifth year cumulative rent increase set forth in the second paragraph of section 4 of the lease. It further stated, in section 1, which deleted and replaced only the third paragraph of section 4 of the lease, that the base rent for each year would increase by 2.5 percent over the immediately preceding year's base rent. When the lease and the amendment are read together, the \"immediately preceding year's base rental\" refers to the base rental required to be paid in the fifth year of the lease, which includes the fifth year cumulative rent increase. A copy of the lease was attached to the amendment as exhibit A.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   As of April 1, 2015, the date on which the court issued its memorandum of decision granting the defendant's motion for\n   summary judgment and denying the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, the defendant had not paid to the plaintiff, as base rent, any portion of the fifth year cumulative rent increase, which the plaintiff\n   argues became due on September 1, 2012. Instead, commencing on September 1, 2012, the beginning of the sixth year of the lease, the defendant paid an annual increase of 2.5 percent on a base rent of $216,000.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On March 20, 2013, the plaintiff commenced the present action against the defendant, alleging that the defendant had breached the lease due to its failure to pay any portion of the fifth year cumulative rent increase set forth in the second paragraph of section 4 of the lease, which it claimed became due and payable, in twelve equal monthly installments, on September 1, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On September 12, 2013, the defendant filed its answer, in which it asserted the special defenses of novation, waiver, and estoppel. The defendant also filed a counterclaim alleging that the May 14, 2012 amendment constituted a novation which modified the \"rent escalation clause\" to \"limit increases annually to 2.5 [percent] in the event [Southbury Food] assigned its lease to the defendant.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   On November 20, 2014, the defendant filed a motion for summary judgment. The plaintiff also filed a motion for summary judgment on November 24, 2014.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   On January 7, 2015, the plaintiff filed an objection to the defendant's motion for summary judgment. The court heard oral argument from the parties on their motions for summary judgment on January 12, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   As stated previously, on April 1, 2015, the court issued a memorandum of decision, wherein it granted the defendant's motion for summary judgment and denied\n   the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   In its memorandum of decision, the court stated in relevant part: \"The present dispute revolves around the question of whether under the terms of the [lease, the assignment, and the amendment], [the defendant] is obligated to pay [the plaintiff the fifth year cumulative rent increase] which was provided for in [section] 4 of the [lease].

Those obligations are identified in the preamble of the [assignment] as follows: [T]he current annual base rent for the period [of] September 1, 2011, to August 31, 2012, is [$216,000] [e.g., $18,000 per month].\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   \"It is true that generally whereas clauses are merely explanations of the circumstances surrounding the execution of the contract and are not binding obligations unless referred to in the operative provisions of the contract. ...\n   <em>\n    DeMorais\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Wisniowski\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3187704\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/81/595/#p610\">\n    81 Conn.App. 595\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 610,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=841%20A.2d%20226\">\n    841 A.2d 226\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8461116,8461141,8461103\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/268/923/\">\n    268 Conn. 923\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=848%20A.2d%20472\">\n    848 A.2d 472\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2004).

This appeal followed. Additional facts shall be set forth as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The plaintiff claims that the court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the defendant because it relied upon the third \"whereas\" clause in the preamble\n   of the assignment to determine that the amount of base rent due in the fifth year of the lease remained at $216,000 per year. Specifically, the plaintiff argues that (1) the defendant took assignment of the entire lease, including the fifth year cumulative rent increase set forth in the second paragraph of section four of the lease, (2) the fifth year cumulative rent increase was neither modified nor eliminated by the amendment, and (3) the amount of base rent due is specified in the lease and the amendment, and the court should not have considered the language of the \"whereas\" clause in the preamble of the assignment. In opposition, the defendant argues that the court properly granted summary judgment in its favor because the assignment and the amendment resulted in a novation whereby the plaintiff released Southbury Food for all its responsibility under the lease, and modified the defendant's rental obligations under the lease in accordance with the assignment and the amendment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   We agree with the plaintiff and conclude that the fifth year cumulative rent increase was not eliminated indisputably by the language of the amendment or the assignment\n   and that, as a result, a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether the defendant is obligated to include in its base rental payments an additional sum representing the fifth year cumulative rent increase pursuant to the second paragraph of section 4 of the lease.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   We begin our analysis by stating the appropriate standard of review. \"Practice Book [\u00a7 17-49 ] provides that summary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material\n   fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law....

Section 6 of the amendment provides that \"[e]xcept as expressly provided hereinabove, the remaining terms and conditions of the [l]ease shall remain unmodified and in full force and effect.\" The\n   amendment was signed by the plaintiff and the defendant on May 14, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The assignment, which the plaintiff, defendant, and Southbury Food executed on May 14, 2012, provides the following in relevant part: \"WHEREAS; the [l]ease has an original term of [ten years, commencing on September 1, 2007, and ending on August 31, 2017]; and\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   \"WHEREAS; the [current] annual base rent for the period [of September 1, 2011 to August 31, 2012, is $216,000 (e.g., $18,000 per month) ]; and\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   \"WHEREAS; [the plaintiff], [Southbury Food] and [the defendant] fully acknowledge the validity of the [l]ease ....\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Following these and other recital provisions, the assignment provides in relevant part: \"[Southbury Food] hereby assigns to [the defendant] all of [Southbury Food's] right, claim, title and interest in and to the leased premises as set forth in the [l]ease ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \"[The defendant] hereby accepts [Southbury Food's] assignment of all of [Southbury Food's] right, claim, title and interest in and to the leased premises as set forth in the [l]ease ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-37\">\n   \"[The plaintiff] hereby consents to the aforesaid assignment from [Southbury Food] to [the defendant], subject to all the terms, conditions and restrictions herein stated and subject to [the defendant's] delivery of the security deposit required under the [l]ease ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-38\">\n   \"[The plaintiff] is not in default pursuant to any [l]ease provision and [Southbury Food] is not in default of any [l]ease provision and remains current in the payment of all obligations thereunder ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-39\">\n   \"Effective upon [Southbury Food's] closing and sale to [the defendant], [the plaintiff] hereby releases [Southbury Food] of any and all liability and obligation under said [l]ease ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   \"[The defendant] acknowledges that [the plaintiff] has not made any representation to [the defendant] with respect to the leased premises ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   \"[The defendant] acknowledges that it is familiar with the leased premises and with the improvements situated thereon and it hereby accepts the same in its present condition 'as is' and that same is suitable and habitable for its purposes; and ...\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   \"In all other respects, the parties hereby ratify and confirm the [l]ease.\" The assignment was executed by the plaintiff, the defendant, and Southbury Food on May 14, 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   Although the operative provisions of the lease as amended do not eliminate the payment of the fifth year cumulative rent increase, one statement in the preamble of the assignment creates an inconsistency in this regard. This inconsistency stems from the third \"whereas\" clause in the assignment, which provides that \"the [current] annual base rent for the period [of September 1, 2011, to August 31, 2012, is $216,000 (e.g., $18,000 per month) ].\" The second paragraph of section 4 of the lease, however, provides that in the fifth year, the one year period that commences on September 1, 2011, and that the aforementioned \"whereas\" clause references, the tenant is required to pay the fifth year cumulative rent increase in addition to the original base rent of $216,000. Additionally, pursuant to section 1 of the amendment, the third paragraph of section 4 of the lease required that commencing in the sixth year of the lease, which began on September 1, 2012, the base rent for each year would increase by 2.5 percent over the base rent of the immediately preceding fifth year. Pursuant to the lease, the base rent for the fifth year is increased by the fifth year cumulative rent increase. Thus, the \"whereas\" clause in the assignment is inconsistent with the fifth year cumulative rent increase set\n   forth in the lease, which is not modified in section 1 of the amendment or in any of the operative provisions of the assignment. Pursuant to the second paragraph of section 4 of the lease, in addition to the base rent of $216,000, the defendant, as the tenant under the lease, would be responsible to pay the additional fifth year cumulative rent increase for that year of the lease, thereby elevating the amount of the base rent by that amount every year thereafter, in addition to the 2.5 percent increases contemplated to begin in the sixth year of the lease by virtue of the amendment.\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court erred in granting the defendant's motion for summary judgment because it improperly determined that there was no genuine issue of material fact with respect to whether the parties to the assignment intended to eliminate, from the calculation of the base rent due for the sixth year of the lease and, thereafter, the fifth year cumulative rent increase. The court, referencing two parts of the assignment, the \"whereas\" clause, which indicated that the current base rent was $216,000, and the provision that stated that Southbury Food was current in its obligations under the lease, concluded that because the amount of the base rent payable at the time of the execution of the assignment and amendment was specified only in the \"whereas\" clause, the defendant was entitled to summary judgment. The court determined that the fifth year cumulative rent increase was not incorporated into either the assignment or the amendment. This determination, however, failed to consider that neither the amendment nor the assignment expressly deleted the lease provision modifying the fifth year cumulative rent increase, and the amendment states that \"the remaining terms and conditions of the [l]ease shall remain unmodified and in full force and effect.\" A copy of the lease, which contained the fifth year cumulative rent increase in section 4, was attached to both the assignment and the amendment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   \"[I]n construing contracts, [the court must] give effect to all the language included therein, as the law of contract interpretation ... militates against interpreting a contract in a way that renders a provision\n   superfluous.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Stratford\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Winterbottom\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=151%20Conn.%20App.%2060\">\n    151 Conn.App. 60\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 72,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=95%20A.3d%20538\">\n    95 A.3d 538\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=314%20Conn.%20911\">\n    314 Conn. 911\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=100%20A.3d%20403\">\n    100 A.3d 403\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014).

Both parties, however, allege the existence of a temporary rent concession. See footnotes 4 and 7 of this opinion. Attached to the plaintiff's complaint is a letter, addressed to Barry Tarnowicz, the president and chief executive officer of Southbury Food, dated October 12, 2011, wherein Keith Sullivan, a certified public accountant who provided services for the plaintiff, indicated that the plaintiff was willing to permit Southbury Food to pay $216,000 in base rent for an additional year, retroactive to August 1, 2011. The letter further provided that \"[a]ll aspects of the current lease remain in effect.\" The defendant also attached this letter to its motion for summary judgment, along with a financial statement of Southbury Food that indicated the following in relevant part: \"[Southbury Food] leases its premises from [the plaintiff] .... Rent expense was $216,000 for each of the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010. Effective September 1, 2011, in addition to the base rent, [Southbury Food] was to also pay the cumulative increase in the [CPI] over the previous four year period. The rent would then increase annually by the increase in the CPI each year through August 31, 2017. This increase was delayed until September 1, 2012.\" The parties disagree as to the effect, if any, of the temporary rent concession on the terms of the lease prior to the execution of the assignment. The court disregarded the temporary rent concession, referring to it as a \"verbal understanding,\" and concluded that it was inadmissible, under the parol evidence rule, to explain the intent of the parties. We are not convinced that evidence of the temporary rent concession should have been precluded, as it is a generally recognized principle that \"[t]he parol evidence rule does not forbid the contradiction of any instrument\n    <em>\n     or portion of an instrument which purports merely to recite facts\n    </em>\n    .\" (Emphasis added.) 11 S.
