On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the trial court improperly concluded that (1) his action for relief from wrongful assessment was untimely because he commenced the action beyond the one year time limitation set forth in General Statutes \u00a7 12-119,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   and (2) he failed to\n   establish a genuine issue of material fact as to whether a continuing course of conduct tolled that time limitation. We\n   disagree with both claims and, accordingly, affirm the judgment of the trial court.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-10\">\n   The following facts and procedural history inform our review. On January 29, 2013, the plaintiff commenced this action by service of a summons and two count complaint on the defendant. In count one of the amended complaint, the plaintiff alleged the following. On October 1, 2011, he was the owner of a parcel of real property located at 1509 Farmington Avenue in Farmington (property).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   On that date, the defendant valued the property at $238,714 and assessed the property at a value of $167,100. The assessment, on which the tax laid on the property was computed, \"was manifestly excessive and could not have been arrived at except by disregarding duties of the assessor established under ... General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 12-62and/or 12-55.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The defendant pleaded the time limitation set forth in \u00a7 12-119as a special defense, alleging that the plaintiff had not commenced the action within one year of the October 1, 2011 assessment he challenged. The defendant thereafter moved for summary judgment on the basis of the special defense. The plaintiff objected, arguing that his action was timely pursuant to \u00a7 12-119as properly read or, in the alternative, that a continuing course of conduct had tolled the limitations period.\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   By memorandum of decision, the trial court rendered summary judgment as to count one. See footnote 2 of this opinion. The court concluded that \"[t]he plaintiff's failure to bring the appeal, as alleged in count one, within the one year period starting with October 1, 2011, supports the defendant's motion for summary judgment.\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   The court further concluded that the plaintiff\n   failed to raise a genuine issue of fact as to whether the defendant had engaged in an illegal course of conduct that would have tolled the limitations period in \u00a7 12-119. This appeal followed. Additional facts will follow as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   On appeal, the plaintiff claims that the court improperly rendered summary judgment for two principal reasons. First, he claims that his commencement of the action on January 29, 2013, was timely because the October 1, 2011 date of the allegedly illegal assessment of the property was not the \"date as of which the property was last evaluated for purposes of taxation,\" on which the one year limitations period in \u00a7 12-119begins. Second, he claims that whether a continuing course of conduct tolled the limitations period was a genuine issue of material fact that precluded summary judgment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   \"Summary judgment may be granted where the [claim] [is] barred by the statute of limitations.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Flannery\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Singer Asset Finance Co., LLC\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=312%20Conn.%20286\">\n    312 Conn. 286\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 310,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=94%20A.3d%20553\">\n    94 A.3d 553\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014). \"The question of whether a claim is barred by the statute of limitations is a question of law over which we exercise plenary review.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Brusby\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Metropolitan District\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=160%20Conn.%20App.%20638\">\n    160 Conn.App. 638\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 661,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=127%20A.3d%20257\">\n    127 A.3d 257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2015).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   \"Practice Book [\u00a7 17-49] provides that summary judgment shall be rendered forthwith if the pleadings, affidavits and any other proof submitted show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the\n   moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. ...

He argues that the \"date as of which the property is last evaluated for purposes of taxation\" within the meaning of \u00a7 12-119is the date on which the assessment is \"finalized\" because \"the evaluation process is ongoing.\" Because the date of finalization will vary according to the circumstances of a given case, he argues, the statute is ambiguous and must be read in his favor. He also contends that the limitations period is directory rather than mandatory or subject to a balancing of the equities, and that an action pursuant to \u00a7 12-119does not exclude the pursuit of other equitable remedies not subject to the time limitation. We are not persuaded.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   \"The legislature, in creating the municipal taxation scheme, placed precise statutes of limitations over most substantive taxpayer claims.\"\n   <em>\n    National CSS, Inc.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Stamford\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"689240\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/195/587/#p594\">\n    195 Conn. 587\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 594,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=489%20A.2d%201034\">\n    489 A.2d 1034\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1985)(citing, among other statutes, \u00a7 12-119). \"It is well settled that, if the owner of the [property] at the [time] of the [assessment] in question ... want[s] to challenge the [assessment], [he is] required to follow the appropriate statutory procedures, either by (1) timely appealing from the [assessment] to the city's board of assessment appeals pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 12-111and 12-112, and from there by timely appealing to the trial court pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 12-117a, or (2) timely bringing a direct action pursuant to ... \u00a7 12-119.

As to the first of these proposed dates, we acknowledge that \u00a7 12-55, which mandates the publication of the taxable grand list on or before January 31, allows the assessor to \"increase or decrease the valuation of any property\" prior to taking the required oath upon the grand list; General Statutes \u00a7 12-55 (b); and, as a result, \"an assessor has the authority under \u00a7 12-55to conduct an interim assessment of property ....\"\n   <em>\n    Kasica\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Columbia\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=309%20Conn.%2085\">\n    309 Conn. at 97\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=70%20A.3d%201\">\n    70 A.3d 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .

We decline to consider this argument because it is inadequately briefed.

In any event, we note that the commencement of an application for relief from an illegal assessment beyond the one year limitations period in \u00a7 12-119, as long as it is specially pleaded, as the defendant has done here, provides a basis for a court to deny the relief provided for in the statute.

We disagree. It is not a court's role to balance the equities to determine whether\n   to apply a statute of limitations in a given case, for, in determining whether to impose a time limitation on a particular type of action, our legislature\n   <em>\n    already\n   </em>\n   has balanced the relevant equities and determined the point in time at which they weigh in favor of finality. \"The purposes of statutes of limitation [s] include finality, repose and avoidance of stale claims and stale evidence. ... These statutes represent a legislative judgment about the balance of equities in a situation involving a tardy assertion of otherwise valid rights: [t]he theory is that even if one has a just claim it is unjust not to put the adversary on notice to defend within the period of limitation and that the right to be free of stale claims in time comes to prevail over the right to prosecute them.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Iacurci\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Sax\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"63\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=313%20Conn.%20786\">\n    313 Conn. 786\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 806-807,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"64\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=99%20A.3d%201145\">\n    99 A.3d 1145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014); see also\n   <em>\n    Danbury\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Dana Investment Corp.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"518126\" index=\"65\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/249/1/#p12\">\n    249 Conn. at 15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"66\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=730%20A.2d%201128\">\n    730 A.2d 1128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (time limitations on taxpayer challenges recognize municipal interest in fiscal certainty).\n   Third, the plaintiff argues that the remedy provided by \u00a7 12-119is \"cumulative and not exclusive of equitable remedies, and a party may elect to proceed under either or both.\" On the contrary, \"as [\u00a7 12-119] was clearly intended to take the place of the remedy in equity based on an overvaluation of the property and as all the relief can be obtained under it which could be afforded by equity, it precludes a resort to equity generally in such a case as the one before us.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Norwich\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Lebanon\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"559580\" index=\"67\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/200/697/#p706\">\n    200 Conn. 697\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 706,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"68\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=513%20A.2d%2077\">\n    513 A.2d 77\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1986); see also\n   <em>\n    Crystal Lake Clean Water Preservation Assn.\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Ellington\n   </em>\n   , supra, 53 Conn.App. at 150,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"69\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=728%20A.2d%201145\">\n    728 A.2d 1145\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"a taxpayer may not [additionally seek a common law remedy] in an attempt to circumvent the time restraints of \u00a7 12-119if it would undermine the purpose of the statute\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The plaintiff also claims that the court improperly concluded that he failed to raise a genuine issue of fact as to whether the defendant's continuing course of conduct tolled the one year limitations period in \u00a7 12-119.

Before the trial court, the plaintiff argued that \"[o]n October 26, 2011, [he] initiated an informal effort to have the assessment reduced,\" which \"continued periodically [until] December 5, 2012 ... when the effort became more formalized. The plaintiff's request to revise the assessment to reflect the nonexistence of the structure created a duty on the part of the defendant to ... at least respond to the plaintiff's legitimate concern. The defendant never responded to the plaintiff's request.\" (Emphasis omitted.) Consequently, he argued, \"[t]he equitable doctrine of continuing course of conduct tolled the inception of any applicable statute of limitations until at least January 13, 2013 ... which was the last occurring conduct outside of this action.\" The evidence by which the plaintiff attempted to demonstrate a continuing course of conduct indicated that in October, 2011, he had sought to reduce the assessment by notifying the defendant of the removal of a house from the property several months prior, and that the parties had met on January 10, 2013, to discuss the assessment of the property.\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   The evidence presented to the trial court in opposition to the defendant's motion for summary judgment demonstrates, in sum, that after initially challenging the\n   2011 assessment on October 26 of that year, the plaintiff waited more than one year before attempting again to challenge the assessment, in December, 2012. See footnote 10 of this opinion. This evidence, which unequivocally indicates the plaintiff's awareness of and disagreement with the 2011 assessment, utterly fails to implicate the continuing course of conduct doctrine.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   Here, the plaintiff clearly had discovered the harm upon which he sued; he simply waited too long to do so. As we previously have noted in this opinion, there were two avenues by which the plaintiff could have challenged the validity of the 2011 assessment of the property: he could have filed a timely appeal to the board of assessment appeals, and, from there, a timely appeal to the Superior Court; see General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 12-111and 12-117a; or he could have filed a timely appeal pursuant to \u00a7 12-119directly to the Superior Court. See\n   <em>\n    Danbury\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Dana Investment Corp.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"518126\" index=\"79\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/249/1/#p12\">\n    249 Conn. at 12-15\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"80\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=730%20A.2d%201128\">\n    730 A.2d 1128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . He elected to engage in periodic \"informal\" efforts to have the assessment reduced instead of commencing the present action under \u00a7 12-119. He offers no authority for the assertion that these efforts created a duty on the part of the defendant to engage in negotiations regarding the assessment, and, indeed, the defendant was under no such duty. The plaintiff's attempts to negotiate a lower assessment were not a substitute for timely resorting to the existing procedure for challenging the assessment's legality. \"[A] taxpayer who has failed to utilize the available statutory remedies [may not] assert ... that the tax has not been properly assessed.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Danbury\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Dana Investment Corp.\n   </em>\n   , supra, at 14-15,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"81\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=730%20A.2d%201128\">\n    730 A.2d 1128\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The judgment is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   In this opinion the other judges concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-50\">\n    General Statutes \u00a7 12-119provides in relevant part: \"When it is claimed ... that a tax laid on property was computed on an assessment which, under all the circumstances, was manifestly excessive and could not have been arrived at except by disregarding the provisions of the statutes for determining the valuation of such property, the owner thereof ... prior to the payment of such tax, may, in addition to the other remedies provided by law, make application for relief to the [S]uperior [C]ourt for the judicial district in which such town or city is situated.
