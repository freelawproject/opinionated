The question before the court is whether it has original jurisdiction, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 9-323,\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   to remedy certain\n   alleged violations of party procedure and election law by caucus officials of one of those factions, the named defendant, the Independent Party of CT-State Central,\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   pertaining to its nomination of the defendant Daniel Carter for the United States Senate. After an expedited hearing on September 29, 2016, the court concluded that the plaintiffs, John R. Price, the nominee for the United States Senate of the other faction, the Independent Party of Connecticut, and Michael Telesca, an elector and registered member of the Independent Party of Connecticut, had failed to establish that the court had jurisdiction to entertain their claims under \u00a7 9-323. The court therefore granted the motion to dismiss filed by the Independent Party of CT-State Central and Carter. This written opinion followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   BACKGROUND\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The record reveals the following undisputed factual and procedural history. In Connecticut, the Independent Party is composed of two factions: the Independent Party of Connecticut, which is based in the city of Waterbury, and the Independent Party of CT-State Central, which is based in the city of Danbury. After proper notice, each faction hosted separate party caucuses in late August, 2016, following which two different nominees for the United States Senate were certified to the secretary of the state: the Independent Party of CT-State Central nominated Carter, and the Independent Party of Connecticut nominated Price.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   On September 2, 2016, after receiving the competing nominations,\n   the secretary of the state notified the two factions that, in accordance with existing policy and General Statutes \u00a7 9-250,\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   neither name would be placed on the ballot under the Independent Party line unless one nominee withdrew.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   Approximately two weeks later, on September 13, an action was filed in the Superior Court in the judicial district of Hartford, seeking to resolve the ongoing dispute over which faction properly controlled the Independent Party.\n   <em>\n    Independent Party of CT-State Central\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Merrill\n   </em>\n   , Superior Court, judicial district of Hartford, Docket No. HHD-CV-16-6071180-S (filed September 13, 2016). Following the filing of a motion to dismiss the claims relating specifically to the United States Senate race for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, both Carter and Price withdrew from the case. On September 23, the plaintiffs filed the present action in the Supreme Court, alleging various violations of party rules and election statutes during the caucus of the Independent Party of CT-State Central,\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   and seeking relief under\n   \u00a7 9-323. On September 26, the plaintiffs sought a judgment declaring that the caucus of the Independent Party of CT-State Central was invalid. The plaintiff also filed a motion for a permanent injunction compelling, inter alia, Carter to withdraw his nomination and the defendant Denise Merrill, the secretary of the state, to place Price's name on the Independent Party line on the November, 2016 ballot.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Significantly, the plaintiffs\n   did\n   <em>\n    not\n   </em>\n   allege any error on the part of the secretary of the state. On September 27, the secretary of the state filed a memorandum in opposition to the plaintiffs' motion for injunctive relief, and, on September 28, the Independent Party of CT-State Central and Carter filed a motion to dismiss on the ground that the court lacked jurisdiction because (1) a \"caucus\" is not an \" 'election' \" for purposes of \u00a7 9-323 ; and (2) caucus administrators are not \" 'election officials' \" under the statute, as the plaintiffs alleged. The secretary of the state likewise argued that the plaintiffs could not prevail because they were not \"aggrieved by any ruling of the secretary\n   [of the state],\" and, further, because their claims were \"barred by the doctrine of laches.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Because \u00a7 9-323 provides that a case filed thereunder shall be resolved expeditiously by a justice of the Supreme Court, the court conducted a hearing on September 29, 2016. After the hearing, the court granted the defendants' motion to dismiss. The court will review the jurisdictional claims first.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   JURISDICTION UNDER \u00a7 9-323\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   For this court to exercise original jurisdiction under \u00a7 9-323, a candidate for the United States Senate or an elector must claim that he or she is \"aggrieved by any ruling of any election official in connection with any election for ... a senator in Congress ....\"\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n   Furthermore, upon bringing the matter before the court, the plaintiff must \"set out the claimed errors of such election official ....\" General Statutes \u00a7 9-323 ; cf.\n   <em>\n    Bortner\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Woodbridge\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1237137\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/250/241/#p259\">\n    250 Conn. 241\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 259,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=736%20A.2d%20104\">\n    736 A.2d 104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1999) (\"as a predicate for the ordering of a new election under [General Statutes] \u00a7 9-328, there must be either [1] an error or errors 'in the rulings of' an election official, or [2] a 'mistake in the count of the votes' \").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Over the past forty years, this court has from time to time considered the meaning of the phrase \"rulings of an election official\" as it is used in several closely related statutes.

For the following reasons, the court concludes that it is not.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   To ascertain the meaning of \"election official\" within the context of \u00a7 9-323, it is appropriate to look to established principles of statutory construction. \"When construing a statute, [the court's] fundamental objective is to ascertain and give effect to the apparent intent of the legislature.... In other words, [the court] seek[s] to determine, in a reasoned manner, the meaning of the statutory language as applied to the facts of [the] case, including the question of whether the language actually does apply.... In seeking to determine that meaning, General Statutes \u00a7 1-2z directs [the court] first to consider the text of the statute itself and its relationship to other statutes. If, after examining such text and considering such relationship,\n   the meaning of such text is plain and unambiguous and does not yield absurd or unworkable results, extratextual evidence of the meaning of the statute shall not be considered.\" (Footnote omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Caruso\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bridgeport\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3958121\" index=\"33\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/285/618/#p639\">\n    285 Conn. at 638-39\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"34\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=941%20A.2d%20266\">\n    941 A.2d 266\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . \"The test to determine ambiguity is whether the statute, when read in context, is susceptible to more than one reasonable\n   interpretation.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Orr\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5764224\" index=\"35\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/291/642/#p651\">\n    291 Conn. 642\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 651,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"36\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=969%20A.2d%20750\">\n    969 A.2d 750\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2009).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   First, although the term \"election official\" is not expressly defined by statute, the term \"election\" is statutorily defined as \"any electors' meeting at which the electors choose public officials by use of voting tabulators or by paper ballots ....\" General Statutes \u00a7 9-1 (d).\n   <footnotemark>\n    12\n   </footnotemark>\n   The Independent Party of CT-State Central and Carter contend that the caucus of the Independent Party of CT-State Central cannot be considered an \"election\" because its function was not to choose public officials but merely to nominate candidates for public office. This argument has persuasive force and counsels against including caucus officials within the scope of \u00a7 9-323.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Second, to the extent that the meaning of the term \"election official\" can be discerned by reference to statutory provisions and case law, as previously explained, it does not include caucus officials for minor parties. Furthermore, whereas it might be appropriate to treat as election officials those other officials who share similar\n   <em>\n    functions\n   </em>\n   , such treatment is far less appropriate when the statutes also articulate specific\n   <em>\n    qualifications\n   </em>\n   for election officials. The General Statutes prescribe at least two such qualifications: (1) election officials must be trained; see General Statutes \u00a7 9-249 ; and (2) \"[a]ll election officials shall be sworn to the faithful performance of their duties ....\" General Statutes \u00a7 9-231. Caucus officials are not required to swear an oath or undergo training. This is compelling, if not dispositive, evidence of the legislature's intent to exclude \"ruling[s]\" by caucus officials from the purview of \u00a7 9-323.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Third, narrowly construing the term \"election official\" accords with the broader statutory framework for conducting nominations. A closer inspection of that framework reveals that election officials and caucus officials not only have different qualifications but also serve different functions. In this state, major parties may be required to hold primaries\n   <footnotemark>\n    13\n   </footnotemark>\n   to select nominees for state office when such nominations are contested. See General Statutes \u00a7 9-415 (a).\n   <footnotemark>\n    14\n   </footnotemark>\n   Much like elections, such\n   primaries are carefully regulated by the state. See, e.g., General Statutes \u00a7 9-381a (\"[e]xcept as otherwise provided by statute, the provisions of the general statutes concerning procedures relating to regular elections shall apply as nearly as may be ... to primaries held under the provisions of this chapter\"); see also General Statutes \u00a7 9-381 (applying provisions of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 9-382 through 9-450, which govern major parties, to \"the nomination by a major party of any candidate for an elective office\"). Indeed, the registrar of voters is charged with appointing and training \"primary officials,\" such as moderators, checkers, challengers, ballot clerks, voting tabulator tenders, and assistant registrars, to oversee the operation of the primary elections. General Statutes \u00a7 9-436 (c) and (d).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In contrast, minor parties are left largely to their own devices during the nomination process. The procedure by which a minor party endorses a nominee is not governed by statute; instead, it is \"prescribed in the\n   rules of such party ....\" General Statutes \u00a7 9-451. Furthermore, such limited filings and notice as are required by statute are to be made by \"the presiding officer of the committee, meeting or other authority making such nomination ....\" General Statutes \u00a7 9-452 ; see also General Statutes \u00a7 9-452a (\"presiding officer\" shall give written notice of party meetings). Insofar as listed election officials, such as registrars of voters, are involved, they are merely required to \"promptly verify and correct the names on [the] ... list [of nominees]\" filed by the party. General Statutes \u00a7 9-452. Thus, whereas elections and primaries are conducted by trained officials appointed by the state and municipalities, according to rules prescribed by statute, party caucuses of the type involved in the present case are structured and conducted almost exclusively by party operatives. In light of the significant disparity between the two procedures, it is unlikely that the legislature intended the term \"election official\" in \u00a7 9-323 to include those individuals who administer party caucuses.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   As a practical matter, this makes sense. Election officials are charged with certain, narrowly defined responsibilities. Their \"ruling[s],\" for purposes of \u00a7 9-323, are therefore confined to a relatively discrete set of actions involving the operation of the electoral process. Insofar as they are responsible for making rulings pertaining to that process, that function is intentionally nonpartisan. In contrast, were the court to accept the plaintiffs' argument, a host of decisions involving party power and party procedure would be subject to expedited review by the court. As the court has observed, however, statutes like \u00a7 9-323 \"[authorize] the one unelected branch of government, the judiciary, to dismantle the basic building block of the democratic process, an election. Thus, [t]he delicacy of judicial intrusion into the electoral process ... strongly suggests caution in\n   undertaking such an intrusion.\" (Citation omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Bortner\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Woodbridge\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1237137\" index=\"37\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/250/241/#p259\">\n    250 Conn. at 254\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"38\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=736%20A.2d%20104\">\n    736 A.2d 104\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ; cf.\n   <em>\n    Reform Party of Connecticut\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bysiewicz\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1116782\" index=\"39\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/254/789/#p796\">\n    254 Conn. 789\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 796,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"40\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=760%20A.2d%201257\">\n    760 A.2d 1257\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2000) ( \"[q]uestions ... concerning the make-up of the convention, the resolution of challenges to delegates and procedures of the convention are political questions left for the party to resolve\"). Likewise, it is unlikely that the legislature intended for \u00a7 9-323 to embroil courts in the minutia of procedures that it commended explicitly to the good judgment of the political parties themselves or in the political decisions made by party operatives on behalf of the party.\n   Nevertheless, the court recognizes that the judiciary has a role to play in promoting fair play even within the nomination process. See\n   <em>\n    Butts\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bysiewicz\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4343886\" index=\"41\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/298/665/#p676\">\n    298 Conn. at 674\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"42\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=5%20A.3d%20932\">\n    5 A.3d 932\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (\"[c]ommon sense, as well as constitutional law, compels the conclusion that government must play an active role in structuring elections; as a practical matter, there must be a substantial regulation of elections if they are to be fair and honest and if some sort of order, rather than chaos, is to accompany the democratic processes\" [internal quotation marks omitted] ). Thus, rather than foreclosing, or even discouraging, adjudication of disputes arising during that broader electoral process, this decision should be read narrowly, as barring only one avenue of relief for the allegedly unlawful or improper actions of caucus officials, that is, by motion to a justice of the Supreme Court under \u00a7 9-323.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   In sum, the court concludes that officials administering minor party caucuses are not \"election official[s]\" for purposes of \u00a7 9-323.

First, the particular controversy in this case-over a United States Senate line on the ballot-is an outgrowth of a dispute over control of the this state's Independent Party that has been ongoing for at least several years. See\n   <em>\n    Independent Party of CT\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Dietter\n   </em>\n   , Superior Court, judicial district of Waterbury, Docket No. CV-12-5016387-S,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=2012%20WL%204902807\">\n    2012 WL 4902807\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (September 28, 2012) (\"[t]he parties to this action are competing officers and nominees of the Independent Party of Connecticut, seeking the placement of party endorsed nominees on the ballot for the general election\"). Second, the caucus at issue, that is, the caucus of the Independent Party of CT-State Central, occurred on August 23, 2016, and the Senate nomination of that faction of the Independent Party was filed with the secretary of the state by August 29, 2016. Thus, even if the plaintiffs could not have anticipated the alleged procedural shortcomings of the caucus, they were certainly aware by late August, 2016, that specific and immediate action needed to be taken. In fact, in light of the history and ongoing nature of the dispute between the two factions, the plaintiffs knew or should have known much earlier that that dispute would need to be addressed before this election cycle. Following the caucuses, the secretary of the state sent notice to both candidates that neither name would be placed on the ballot. From that date,\n   September 2, 2016, until September 13, 2016, no action was taken.\n   <footnotemark>\n    16\n   </footnotemark>\n   Not until September 23 did the plaintiffs initiate the present action under \u00a7 9-323.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-40\">\n   The electoral machinery of the state has been far less indecisive. By the time this case was heard on September 29, 2016, overseas and military ballots had already been issued. Printing of absentee ballots was underway, and programming of voting machines was imminent. At the hearing, the secretary of the state confirmed that, in the event of reprinting, absentee ballots would be delayed to a \"certainty,\" in violation of the requirements of General Statutes \u00a7 9-140 (f),\n   <footnotemark>\n    17\n   </footnotemark>\n   and perhaps in violation of article sixth, \u00a7 7, of the Connecticut constitution,\n   <footnotemark>\n    18\n   </footnotemark>\n   as implemented by \u00a7 9-140 (f). Costs associated with reprinting and reprogramming would run at least $218,000 and would be borne by the cities and towns affected. Given these considerations, the court finds that the secretary of the state has met her burden of establishing prejudicial delay. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Fishman\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Schaffer\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5762\" index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/us/429/1325/#p1330\">\n    429 U.S. 1325\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 1330,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"56\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=97%20S.%20Ct.%2014\">\n    97 S.Ct. 14\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"57\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=50%20L.%20Ed.%202d%2056\">\n    50 L.Ed.2d 56\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1976) (citing printing of Presidential, overseas and absentee ballots as \"factors militating against the extraordinary relief\" of injunction placing candidate on ballot).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-41\">\n   The court also finds that the plaintiffs' delay is \"inexcusable ....\" (Internal quotation\n   marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    Cummings\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Tripp\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"501596\" index=\"58\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/204/67/#p88\">\n    204 Conn. at 88\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"59\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=527%20A.2d%20230\">\n    527 A.2d 230\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . Indeed, given its proximity to the election, the delay of nearly two weeks between the letter from the secretary of the state and the filing of any court action might be considered inexcusable. Other courts have found delays nearly as short to be inexcusable. See, e.g.,\n   <em>\n    Kay\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Austin\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"482358\" index=\"60\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/f2d/621/809/#p810\">\n    621 F.2d 809\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 810, 813 (6th Cir. 1980) (equitable relief was barred by doctrine of laches when candidate filed action eleven days after discovering that his name was not on ballot). But this finding need not rest on those two weeks, or even on the time between the September 13, 2016 filing of the action in the Superior Court and the September 23 filing with this court. Instead, the court finds that the failure to address ongoing questions of party control until mid-September-only two weeks before ballot preparation was scheduled to begin-constitutes inexcusable delay.\n   <footnotemark>\n    19\n   </footnotemark>\n   The courts need not shoulder the burden of resolving internecine conflicts on a truncated timeline simply because the parties have inexplicably failed to press their claims at an earlier date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-42\">\n   Thus, even if the plaintiffs' claims fell within the purview of \u00a7 9-323, the doctrine of laches would operate as an independent and adequate ground to dismiss the plaintiffs' action.
