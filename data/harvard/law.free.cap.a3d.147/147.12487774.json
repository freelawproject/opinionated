Barbara M. Quinn\n   </em>\n   , judge trial referee, made the following findings of fact. J.V. and his wife, K.V., are the child's legal guardians (guardians).\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n   In December, 2014, in the Court of Probate for the District of Danbury, the petitioner, J.V., filed an application to terminate the respondent's parental rights, pursuant to General Statutes \u00a7 45a-717. The application alleged\n   that the respondent's parental rights should be terminated on the ground of abandonment; General Statutes \u00a7 45a-717(g)(2)(A) ; and no ongoing parent-child relationship; General Statutes \u00a7 45a-717(g)(2)(C).\n   <footnotemark>\n    4\n   </footnotemark>\n   Pursuant to a motion filed by counsel for the child, the matter was transferred to the Superior Court for Juvenile Matters. See General Statutes \u00a7 45a-715. The trial was conducted between October 5 and October 8, 2015.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   The respondent and the child's father had dated one another while they were in high school. They later married and had one child who is the subject of the present\n   termination proceeding. The child was born in 2005. The couple's relationship was marked by domestic violence and alcohol abuse. In 2006, they were living apart from one another. Despite their differences, the couple tried to \"patch things up.\" One evening they went out to dinner and were involved in a serious motor vehicle crash. The child's father was killed at the scene, and the respondent suffered serious injuries. The accident investigation concluded that the respondent and the child's father were intoxicated with blood alcohol levels in excess of the legal limit.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The respondent subsequently married G.U. with whom she has a son, Z. The respondent's relationship with G.U. also was characterized by domestic violence, and drug and alcohol abuse. The child and Z were exposed to a great deal of turbulence. As a consequence of their domestic violence, the respondent and G.U. were arrested on numerous occasions. Although the respondent reported that G.U. instigated the violence, the court found that the respondent was the primary aggressor. In January, 2010, the respondent was so angry that she attacked G.U. with a knife and tried to cut his face. The child, who was five years old at the time, was awakened from sleep by the fracas. She still recalled the incident at the time of trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   On January 17, 2010, the Department of Children and Families (department) obtained an order of temporary custody and removed both children from the care of respondent and G.U. and placed them with the guardians. The child was adjudicated neglected on November 22, 2010, and placed in the guardians' care.\n   <footnotemark>\n    5\n   </footnotemark>\n   When the child entered the guardians' home, she was terrified of knives, including the mere mention of them. She was shy, withdrawn, anxious, and suffered night terrors. When she was traveling in a motor vehicle, the child\n   became nervous and fearful that the respondent was following and would take her away. The guardians placed her in therapy, which was of some benefit to her.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   At the time of the neglect proceedings, the court,\n   <em>\n    Sommer, J.\n   </em>\n   , ordered once-a-week visitation between the respondent and the child and joint counseling for them. The therapist was to work with the respondent and the child to improve their relationship and expand visitation and was authorized to make recommendations regarding the progress, duration, and frequency, as well as the supervision, of the visits between the respondent and the child. The hoped-for normalization of the parent-child relationship between the respondent and the child did not take place due to the trauma the child had suffered as a result of the constant violence in her parental home. The child did not want to\n   talk about her life with the respondent, even five years later at the time of the termination of parental rights trial.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   The respondent and the child had scheduled visitation during the first year and one-half following the transfer of guardianship. The child was anxious, however, and her symptoms increased prior to each visit. It was difficult to schedule the time and location of the visits. The guardians asked the respondent to provide adequate notice so that they could prepare the child emotionally to be ready for the visit. The respondent often gave notice at the last minute, after the child had gone to bed for the night, which made it difficult for the guardians to prepare her for the visit, which took place at restaurants, in the community, and in parks. Sometimes Z or the court appointed guardian ad litem attended the visits. On the way to the visits, the child complained of having a stomach ache and that she needed to throw up. The visits lasted for approximately one hour, sometimes longer. Often the child wished the visits to be shortened. Occasionally, the respondent brought the child a gift. Once, the respondent took the\n   child to a \"Build-a-Bear\" store, where she purchased a teddy bear for the child. When the child returned to the guardians' home, she wanted to throw out the bear. By early 2012, the visits between the respondent and the child were sporadic and far between. The two were no longer were engaged in joint therapy, and the therapist did not recommend increasing the amount of time the respondent spent with the child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   In March, 2012, the respondent filed a motion for increased visitation. The parties reached an agreement that, after three individual therapy sessions, the respondent could have therapeutic visits with the child. The respondent, however, failed to attend the three required therapy sessions, and all visits ceased. The respondent last visited the child on April 9, 2012. The respondent and child have had no contact since then.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   The respondent claimed that she failed to continue therapy and engage in therapeutic visits with the child for financial reasons. She had no insurance and inadequate income from her employment. The court found no evidence that the respondent made any attempt to seek therapy on a sliding pay scale or to ask for help from others, such as the guardian ad litem, to find affordable therapy. She made only a minimal effort to comply with the court-ordered conditions for increased access to the child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   In addition to failing to find means by which she could increase her access to the child, the respondent did not take advantage of other avenues open to her that would demonstrate her commitment to the child. The respondent provided no financial support for the child nor did she send the child letters or gifts. She failed to inquire about the child's school progress, medical appointments, or her life in general. The court found that whatever her level of concern may have been, the\n   respondent failed to manifest it in a concrete manner to inform herself about the child's daily life and progress.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   The respondent filed another motion for visitation in December, 2013. The department investigated and filed a visitation report dated July 7, 2014. After reviewing the history and the child's relationship with the respondent, the department did not recommend visitation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   Court-ordered psychological evaluations of both the respondent and the child were performed in October, 2014, by Deborah Gruen, a clinical and forensic psychologist. The guardians also were interviewed. On the basis of Gruen's testimony at trial, the court found that the respondent was an emotionally sensitive person who has a\n   propensity for unstable relationships. She can be irritable, demanding, and charming at the same time, is manipulative in her relationships, and exercises poor judgment. Although Gruen did not provide a diagnosis, she found that the respondent exhibits antisocial behavior and borderline personality traits. She recommended that the respondent receive intensive psychotherapy with a seasoned clinician to deal with the trauma the respondent herself has experienced, both as a child and in her adult relationships.\n   <footnotemark>\n    6\n   </footnotemark>\n   Without intensive treatment, Gruen's prognosis for the respondent is guarded. Because the respondent was pregnant in November, 2014, Gruen recommended that the respondent wait at least six months before entering therapeutic intervention. This period of time was needed to give the respondent time to adjust to all of the significant changes that were coming to her life.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   The court asked Gruen to answer additional questions, which she did in August, 2015. Gruen summarized the treatment the respondent had received and results\n   of the conversation she had with the respondent's clinician. By the end of July, 2015, the respondent had had twenty-two sessions of therapy and had made substantial strides to address her long-standing trauma-related issues. The respondent has stable employment with considerable management responsibilities and has custody of her youngest child. Z is in her care several times a week, but his father is his primary caretaker. The respondent is beginning the difficult introspection and emotional work that she needs to improve herself for the sake of her children as well as herself. The court found that the respondent's changes came about after the child had been out of the respondent's primary care for five years.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   According to Gruen, the child has only bad memories of life with the respondent, and she does not wish to see or interact with her. The child suffers underlying anxiety and needs to strengthen her ability to acknowledge her anxieties and address her fears on a more realistic basis. The therapist did not recommend that the child visit with the respondent until the respondent had undertaken intensive therapy. In the spring of 2015, the child was in therapy, having been diagnosed with posttraumatic stress, as a result of the trauma she has witnessed. The child's therapist echoed Gruen's concern about the child's building a relationship with the respondent. Children in her situation are very cautious, hostile, and estranged. The therapist could not predict what would happen if the child and respondent met, as there could be widely different outcomes. As the child grows, however, the therapist opined that she will need some access to the respondent; children who are in the child's situation grow-up \"missing a part of themselves,\" which is necessary for their stable, balanced, and mature adult development.\n   <footnotemark>\n    7\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   The court found, according to the guardian ad litem, that in 2011, the child was very anxious and uncomfortable whenever the respondent was mentioned. The child wanted to remain with the guardians, and her attitude was unchanged in 2015. She is settled in the guardians' home where she is a happy and loving ten year old, who is enthusiastic about school and the things that she does with her family. In the opinion of the guardian ad litem, termination of the respondent's parental rights is in the best interest of the child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   The court analyzed the facts and the grounds alleged for termination of the respondent's parental rights in the child in the adjudicatory phase of the proceedings. As to the ground of abandonment alleged pursuant to \u00a7 45a-717(g)(2)(A),\n   <footnotemark>\n    8\n   </footnotemark>\n   the court noted that the appellate courts of this state have held that \"[t]he commonly understood general obligations of parenthood entail these minimum attributes: (1) [the expression of] love and affection for the child; (2) [the expression of] personal concern over the health, education and general well-being of the child; (3) the duty to supply the necessary food, clothing, and medical care; (4) the duty to\n   provide an adequate domicile; and (5) the duty to furnish social and religious guidance.\" (Internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    In re Kezia M.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1329730\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/33/12/#p18\">\n    33 Conn.App. 12\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 18,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=632%20A.2d%201122\">\n    632 A.2d 1122\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , cert. denied,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"1325760,1325729,1325762,1325725\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/228/915/\">\n    228 Conn. 915\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=636%20A.2d%20847\">\n    636 A.2d 847\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1993).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   Abandonment has been defined as a parent's failure to maintain a reasonable degree of interest, concern or responsibility as to the welfare of the child, and maintain implies a continuing, reasonable degree of interest, concern, or responsibility and not merely a sporadic showing thereof.

She has not expressed love and affection toward the child in any meaningful way and has failed to inquire about the child's health, education, and general well-being, and has not made any effort to provide financial support for the child. Although the court did not doubt that in her heart, the respondent loves the child and wishes that she could visit with her, the respondent is aware that the child does not wish to have contact with her. The court found that the respondent is wise enough not to force contact with the child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   The court credited the respondent with good intentions, but noted that thoughts and wishes are insufficient to sustain a child. The court found that the respondent had choices to make in the five years since the child left her care. On three separate occasions, in 2010, 2012, and 2014, the respondent was offered visits with the child if she entered therapy. It was not until 2014 that the respondent began the arduous process of making positive changes in her life. Although the\n   respondent has made sufficient progress to enable her to have her two younger children\n   <footnotemark>\n    9\n   </footnotemark>\n   in her care on a regular basis,\n   that progress has been too little and too late for the child who is the subject of the present termination of parental rights petition.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   The respondent failed to write to the child or to send her gifts. She failed to communicate with the guardians as to the child's well-being. Although the respondent believes that the guardians prevented her from doing so, she failed to reach out to take advantage of the resources available to her, such as the child's guardian ad litem and attorney. The court concluded that the clear and convincing evidence of respondent's failures constitutes legal abandonment.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   Although a court need find only one statutory ground to terminate parental rights in a child; see\n   <em>\n    In re Alexander C.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"260600\" index=\"14\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/67/417/#p427\">\n    67 Conn.App. 417\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 427,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"15\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=787%20A.2d%20608\">\n    787 A.2d 608\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2001), aff'd,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"653157\" index=\"16\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/262/308/\">\n    262 Conn. 308\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"17\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=813%20A.2d%2087\">\n    813 A.2d 87\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2003) ; the court adjudicated the second reason alleged by the petitioner. To grant a termination of parental rights petition on the ground that there is no ongoing parent-child relationship pursuant to \u00a7 45-717 (g) (2) (C),\n   <footnotemark>\n    10\n   </footnotemark>\n   the court must find that no parent-child relationship exists and that looking prospectively, it would be detrimental to the child's best interest to allow time for such a relationship to develop. See\n   <em>\n    In re Christian P.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"3565076\" index=\"18\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn-app/98/264/#p269\">\n    98 Conn.App. 264\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 269,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"19\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=907%20A.2d%201261\">\n    907 A.2d 1261\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006). In the present case, the court\n   found that there is no remaining parent-child relationship between the respondent and the child; it evaporated in the long period of time in which the respondent had no contact with the child. The critical issue, the court found, was whether it is detrimental to the child's best interest to permit more time for such a relationship to develop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   The court found that the child is happy and secure in the guardians' home and her school. The mere mention of the respondent upsets the child. The child has no positive memories of the respondent. Permitting more time in the child's young life for such a relationship to develop is detrimental to the child's best interest when the child has been out of the respondent's care for more than one half of her life. The court concluded from the clear and convincing evidence that the petitioner had proven that there was no ongoing parent child relationship and that it was not in the child's best interest to permit more time for such a relationship to develop.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   The court then made the statutory findings required in the dispositional phase of the proceedings. See General Statutes \u00a7 45a-717(h). The court found that the dispositional factors all pointed toward a finding that termination of parental rights was in the child's best interest. The child is in crucial need of safety, stability, and permanency, which the respondent is not in a position to provide. The court concluded on the basis of the clear and convincing evidence that termination of the respondent's parental rights is in the child's best interest. Additional facts will be set out as necessary.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   Before addressing the respondent's claims on appeal, we set forth \"the well established legal framework for deciding termination of parental rights petitions.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   [A] hearing on a petition to terminate parental rights consists of two phases: the adjudicatory phase and the dispositional phase. During the adjudicatory phase, the\n   trial court must determine whether one or more of the ... grounds for termination of parental rights set forth in [\u00a7 45-717 (g) ] exists by clear and convincing evidence .... If the trial court determines that a statutory ground for termination exists, then it proceeds to the dispositional phase.

The department was involved with the respondent, the child, and Z at the time the children were removed from her care. The department's involvement terminated when the child's guardianship was transferred to the guardians. The department saw no child protection issues following the transfer of guardianship. Thereafter, the department had no obligation to offer the respondent services.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-43\">\n   At the time the child's guardianship was transferred, the court ordered visits between the respondent and the child, but the respondent did not comply with the order. The guardians did comply by offering the respondent visits with the child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-44\">\n   At the time of the termination hearing, the child was ten years old and had no relationship with the respondent. She is an anxious child and becomes concerned whenever the respondent is mentioned. The child has no fond memories of the respondent and wishes to remain permanently in the guardians' home and to be adopted by them.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-45\">\n   The respondent failed to make adequate efforts to have the child returned to her home. She abandoned the child and failed to communicate with the guardians in any meaningful way. At the time of the termination of parental rights proceeding, the respondent was engaged in therapy and had made significant strides, but those strides were too late for the child, who had\n   grown deeply attached to others. A child's sense of time is not the same as an adult's. Most of the child's conscious life has been spent with her guardians, not the respondent.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-46\">\n   The court found that, although the respondent believes that the guardians have prevented her from having reasonable visits with the child, the evidence demonstrates that the respondent failed to take the steps she should have taken to maintain access to the child. Although the respondent's past economic circumstances have made her life more challenging, those circumstances, in and of themselves, did not prevent her from maintaining a reasonable relationship with the child.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-47\">\n   \"It is axiomatic that a trial court's factual findings are accorded great deference. Accordingly, an appellate tribunal will not disturb a trial court's finding that termination of parental rights is in a child's best interest unless that finding is clearly erroneous .... A finding is clearly erroneous when either there is no evidence in the record to support it, or the reviewing court is left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been made .... [E]very reasonable presumption is made in favor of the trial court's ruling .... Additionally, in reviewing the court's findings under the dispositional phase of the proceedings, it is appropriate to read the trial court's opinion as a whole, including its findings in the adjudicatory phase.\" (Citations omitted; footnote omitted; internal quotation marks omitted.)\n   <em>\n    In re Elijah G.-R.\n   </em>\n   , supra,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12486214\" index=\"48\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/142/482/#p18\">\n    167 Conn.App. at 29-30\n   </extracted-citation>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12486214\" index=\"49\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/142/482/#p18\">\n    142 A.3d 482\n   </extracted-citation>\n   .\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-48\">\n   We carefully have reviewed the court's memorandum of decision, including its factual findings in the adjudicatory phase of the proceedings, and reviewed the record. We conclude that the court's finding that termination of the respondent's parental rights is in the best interest of the child is not clearly erroneous. At the time of trial,\n   the child had resided with her guardians for approximately five years, she is anxious and fearful of the respondent, and she does not want to visit with her. In fact, there have been no visits between the respondent and the child for an extended period of time. The underlying facts support the court's conclusion that the anxious child who is the subject of the termination petition is in need of stability and permanency and that termination of the respondent's parental rights is in her best interest.

[T]he plain error doctrine ... is not ... a rule of reviewability. It is a rule of reversibility. That is, it is a doctrine that this court invokes in order to rectify a trial court ruling that, although either not properly preserved or never raised at all in the trial court, nonetheless requires reversal of the trial court's judgment, for reasons of policy .... In addition, the plain error doctrine is reserved for truly extraordinary situation [in which] the existence of the error is so obvious that it affects the fairness and integrity of and public confidence in the judicial proceedings .... Plain error is a doctrine that should be invoked sparingly .... Implicit in this very demanding standard is the notion ... that invocation of the plain error doctrine is reserved for occasions requiring the reversal of the judgment under review .... [Thus, an appellant] cannot prevail under [the plain error doctrine] ... unless he demonstrates that the claimed error is both so clear and so harmful that a failure to reverse the judgment would result in manifest injustice ....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   \"[Our Supreme Court has] clarified the two step framework under which we review claims of plain error. First, we must determine whether the trial court in fact committed an error and, if it did, whether that error was indeed plain in the sense that it is patent [or] readily discernible on the face of a factually adequate record, [and] also ... obvious in the sense of not debatable .... [T]his inquiry entails a relatively high standard, under which it is not enough for the [respondent] simply to demonstrate that his position is correct. Rather, [to prevail] the party [claiming] plain error [reversal] must\n   demonstrate that the claimed impropriety was so clear, obvious and indisputable as to warrant the extraordinary remedy of reversal ....\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   \"In addition, although a clear and obvious mistake on the part of the trial court is a prerequisite for reversal under the plain error doctrine, such a finding is not, without more, sufficient to warrant the application of the doctrine. Because [a] party cannot prevail under plain error unless it has demonstrated that the failure to grant relief will result in manifest injustice ... under the second prong of the analysis we must determine whether the consequences of the error are so grievous as to be fundamentally unfair or manifestly unjust ....

In both\n   <em>\n    In re Elijah G.-R.\n   </em>\n   and\n   <em>\n    In re Leilah\n   </em>\n   the respondents were represented by counsel. Although there were some differences in the way in which the canvasses were conducted in those cases, this court concluded that the stated purpose underlying the\n   <em>\n    Yasiel\n   </em>\n   canvass was met even though the respondents were not canvassed prior to the termination trial. In coming to that conclusion in each case, this court considered the factors the\n   <em>\n    Yasiel\n   </em>\n   canvass was intended to address and the actual trials of the subject cases.\n   <footnotemark>\n    22\n   </footnotemark>\n   This court found in both of those cases that on appeal, the respondents failed to explain how they were harmed by the timing of the\n   <em>\n    Yasiel\n   </em>\n   canvass, whether they would have moved for a new trial or asked that the evidence be opened and what additional evidence they might offer that would have made a difference in the trial.

Although the trial court in the present case did not canvass the respondent, she has failed to explain what she did not know or understand about the termination of her parental rights without the court's canvass. She has not explained what\n   she would have done differently if the court had canvassed her and how the outcome of the case would be different.

The record discloses that the respondent was represented by counsel, who cross-examined the petitioner's witnesses, and objected to evidence. She presented her own witnesses and evidence and argued in opposition to the termination of her parental rights. The respondent testified on her own behalf. It appears, as our Supreme Court has said, that the \"[w]hen the respondent is represented by counsel, the current procedures in place adequately protect the respondent from any claimed constitutional deficiencies.\"\n   <em>\n    In re Yasiel R.\n   </em>\n   , supra, 317 Conn. at 785,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"99\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=120%20A.3d%201188\">\n    120 A.3d 1188\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . The question we must therefore address is whether the absence of a canvass in the present case is likely to cause the public to lose faith in the integrity of our judicial system. On the basis of our review of the proceedings in the trial court, we\n   conclude that such an outcome would surely not occur. Although the court's failure to give a\n   <em>\n    Yasiel\n   </em>\n   canvass is clear, obvious and indisputable, the respondent has failed to demonstrate that the failure has resulted in a fundamentally unfair termination proceeding that would cause the public to lose faith in the judicial system.\n   <footnotemark>\n    23\n   </footnotemark>\n   She therefore cannot prevail on her\n   plain error claim that the judgment terminating her parental rights in the child should be reversed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-65\">\n   In concluding that the judgment terminating the respondent's parental rights in the child should not be reversed, we are mindful that our Supreme Court repeatedly has addressed the need for permanency in the life of a child.

The child at issue here has been living with her guardians since 2010; she is eleven years old, has no relationship with the respondent, and wishes to be adopted by her guardians. It is now 2016. To reverse the judgment at this point in the child's life, we believe, would in and of itself undermine the public's confidence in the integrity of our judicial system in that the child would be left in limbo for an indeterminate period of time until a new trial can be held.
