Herring, appeals from the judgment of the Appellate Court affirming his conviction, rendered after a jury trial, of conspiracy to distribute one kilogram or more of a cannabis-type substance in violation of General Statutes \u00a7\u00a7 21a-278(b) and 53a-48, and possession of one kilogram or more of a cannabis-type substance with intent to sell\n   as an accessory in violation of \u00a7 21a-278(b) and General Statutes \u00a7 53a-8.\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Herring\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=151%20Conn.%20App.%20154\">\n    151 Conn.App. 154\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 155, 173,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=94%20A.3d%20688\">\n    94 A.3d 688\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2014). The Appellate Court concluded, inter alia, that, under the waiver rule announced in\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4343690\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/299/447/#p482\">\n    299 Conn. 447\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 482-83,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=10%20A.3d%20942\">\n    10 A.3d 942\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011), the defendant failed to preserve his claim that the trial court had incorrectly instructed the jury on the state of mind required to find him guilty of both offenses.\n   <footnotemark>\n    1\n   </footnotemark>\n   See\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Herring\n   </em>\n   , supra, 170-71,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=94%20A.3d%20688\">\n    94 A.3d 688\n   </extracted-citation>\n   . On appeal to this\n   court, the defendant does not challenge the Appellate Court's conclusion that he waived his jury instruction claim under\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   . Instead, he requests that the waiver rule in\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   be overturned and that his claim be reviewed under\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"566558\" index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/conn/213/233/#p239\">\n    213 Conn. 233\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 239-40,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=567%20A.2d%20823\">\n    567 A.2d 823\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1989).\n   <footnotemark>\n    2\n   </footnotemark>\n   He contends that, if this court reviews his claim under\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   , he would prevail because the trial court's instruction resulted in harmful error. In the alternative, the defendant seeks review under the plain error doctrine. Our resolution of the defendant's request to overturn the waiver rule is controlled by our decision in\n   <em>\n    State\n   </em>\n   v.\n   <em>\n    Bellamy\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487856\" index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/147/655/#p403\">\n    323 Conn. 400\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 403,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487856\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/147/655/#p403\">\n    147 A.3d 655\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2016), in which we considered the rule's continued viability and concluded that it should not be overturned. Accordingly, we reject the defendant's request to overturn the waiver rule in\n   <em>\n    Kitchens\n   </em>\n   and to review his jury instruction claim under\n   <em>\n    Golding\n   </em>\n   . We also decline to review his claim under the plain error doctrine because such review is beyond the scope of the certified question.\n   <footnotemark>\n    3\n   </footnotemark>\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   The judgment of the Appellate Court is affirmed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   In this opinion the other justices concurred.\n  </p>\n  <footnote label=\"1\">\n   <p id=\"p-19\">\n    The defendant claimed on appeal to the Appellate Court, and continues to claim in his brief to this court, that the trial court's jury instructions \"lowered the state's burden of proof on both counts and misled the jury\" because they included \"objective 'reasonable person' language in [their] definition of knowingly, which, by statute, is defined as 'awareness,' a purely subjective determination.\"\n   </p>\n  </footnote>\n  <footnote label=\"2\">\n   <p id=\"p-20\">\n    We note that the parties in\n    <em>\n     State\n    </em>\n    v.\n    <em>\n     Bellamy\n    </em>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487856\" index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/147/655/#p403\">\n     323 Conn. 400\n    </extracted-citation>\n    ,\n    <extracted-citation case-ids=\"12487856\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/a3d/147/655/#p403\">\n     147 A.3d 655\n    </extracted-citation>\n    (2016), asked this court to adopt the arguments made by the parties and their amicus in the present appeal.
