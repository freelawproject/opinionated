Wolters, Jr. and Steven M. Lospennato (hereinafter \"defendants\")\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-11\">\n   appeal multiple orders of the Superior Court (\n   <em>\n    Wageling\n   </em>\n   , J.) ruling that their property was not benefited by a deeded right-of-way over several other properties and finding them liable for abuse of process. The third-party defendant, Emmett Horgan, Trustee of the FUN Trust (FUN Trust), cross-appeals, arguing that the trial court erred in finding that the defendants had not committed slander of title and in calculating the damages award for the trust's abuse of process claim. We affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-12\">\n   I\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-13\">\n   The trial court found, or the record supports, the following facts. This case involves the defendants' alleged entitlement to travel across several properties in Salem in order to access Route 28. The defendants own the property located at 16 Garabedian Drive, and claim to have a deeded right-of-way to travel from their property eastward, across State-owned railroad tracks and continuing across the southernmost section of two parcels of land owned by Cumberland Farms, Inc. and 392 South Broadway, LLC respectively. The Cumberland Farms property abuts the railroad on its western boundary and 392 South Broadway's property to the southeast. 392 South Broadway's property is bounded on the north and west by the Cumberland Farms property and Route 28 on the east. The travel way across these properties is known as Cuomo Drive.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-14\">\n   This case was instituted, in 2009, by plaintiffs 412 South Broadway Realty, LLC and Salem Rockingham, LLC, which owned property located just to the south of Cuomo Drive, against the defendants and Cumberland Farms. 412 South Broadway, whose property abuts Cuomo Drive on its northern boundary, alleged that the defendants were crossing onto its property and unlawfully expanding the right-of-way located on Cumberland Farms's property. 412 South Broadway requested a declaratory judgment that the right-of-way did not run across its property and that the defendants had no property rights over its land. Because the litigation involved the defendants' claim that they had the right to cross the State-owned railroad tracks and the property owned by 392 South Broadway, the trial court required that they both be joined as parties to the litigation.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-15\">\n   The defendants filed several counterclaims against 412 South Broadway, alleging that, over its years of use, Cuomo Drive had expanded onto a small section of 412 South Broadway's property and that the defendants had acquired that portion through adverse possession or, alternatively, had acquired a prescriptive easement over it. This disputed portion of 412 South Broadway's property became known throughout the case as the \"cross-hatched area.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-16\">\n   In 2011, 412 South Broadway sold its property to FUN Trust. FUN Trust later joined the litigation and asserted several claims against the defendants. Among other claims, FUN Trust alleged that the defendants had committed slander of title and abuse of process in connection with the appeal of a site plan approval that FUN Trust had received from the Town of Salem Planning Board in 2012.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-17\">\n   Prior to trial, the State and Cumberland Farms settled the claims pending against them. As a result, the remaining property rights issues concerned the defendants' claims that: (1) they had adversely possessed, or gained prescriptive easement rights to, the cross-hatched area on FUN Trust's property; and (2) they had a deeded right-of-way over the property owned by 392 South Broadway. The parties agreed to present evidence with regard to these issues, and then, depending upon the\n   outcome, FUN Trust would present evidence on its slander of title and abuse of process claims against the defendants at a later date.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-18\">\n   Following a four-day bench trial, the trial court issued an order finding that the defendants had not demonstrated any property rights to the crosshatched area. Specifically, the trial court stated that, due to a berm constructed along the northern boundary of FUN Trust's property line in the 1990s, the defendants \"failed to demonstrate continuous use of the crosshatched area for the prescriptive period.\" The trial court also found that \"even if [the defendants] could demonstrate they have fulfilled the requisite time requirements for adverse possession, they have not shown a definitive right to the disputed area because their description of the area crossed lacks any specificity.\"\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-19\">\n   With regard to the defendants' claim of deeded easement rights over 392 South Broadway's property, the trial court found that no such right existed. The trial court determined that, in 1874, the original grantor, John A. Messer, sold a parcel of property on the east side of the railroad tracks, which included the land that eventually became the lot owned by 392 South Broadway, reserving as a right-of-way \"whatever may be necessary in going to and from land of said Messer on the Westerly side of said Railroad.\" The trial court found that \"at the time John A. [Messer] reserved that right of way for himself, the property he owned on the West ... side of the rail road tracks [which included the defendants' property] was a life estate only.\" Thus, the court stated that John A. Messer \"did not reserve for himself a perpetual right of way[;] [r]ather, he reserved a personal interest, or an easement in gross,\" which terminated when his interest in the life estate terminated.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-20\">\n   Alternatively, the trial court ruled that, even assuming that the right-of-way passed with title to the property west of the railroad tracks, the right-of-way was later extinguished as to the defendants' property. The court cited a deed in the defendants' chain of title that did not mention the right-of-way in 1945, but found that the same grantor specifically did reference the right-of-way in deeds conveying two properties on the east side of the railroad tracks. The trial court found that that grantor \"chose only to convey the benefit of the right of way to [the] properties on the East side of the railroad tracks\" and that the defendants' property \"did not obtain the disputed right of way.\" Given these rulings, the trial court directed the clerk to set a date for a bench trial regarding FUN Trust's remaining slander of title and abuse of process claims.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-21\">\n   FUN Trust's remaining claims stemmed from the defendants' appeal of a 2012 Town of Salem Planning Board decision, which, over the defendants' objections, approved FUN Trust's site plan application. The defendants claimed that the planned redevelopment interfered with their rights to access Cuomo Drive and to cross over FUN Trust's property. The trial court heard evidence on these claims during a two-day bench trial. In its order, the court found that the defendants were not liable for slander of title because the statements that they had made were protected by judicial privilege.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-22\">\n   However, the court found that the defendants were liable for abuse of process. It ruled that the defendants \"failed to properly investigate their claim of adverse possession or prescriptive easement prior to the filing of the 2012 Appeal.\" It also found that the defendants made a nearly identical claim in a prior planning board appeal that was rejected, and that they pursued the 2012 appeal with the knowledge\n   that the planning board did not have the authority to decide boundary disputes. Additionally, relying upon e-mails exchanged between the parties, the court found that the defendants had sought \"borderline extortionate terms\" in exchange for supporting FUN Trust's site plan application. The court ordered that the defendants pay FUN Trust's attorney's fees for the defense of the 2012 planning board appeal. This appeal followed.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-23\">\n   II\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-24\">\n   On appeal, the defendants argue that the trial court erred: (1) in finding that they did not have a deeded right-of-way over 392 South Broadway's property; (2) in denying their motion to dismiss FUN Trust's claims for slander of title and abuse of process based upon res judicata and collateral estoppel; (3) in ruling in favor of FUN Trust on its abuse of process claim; and (4) in relying upon settlement communications between the parties as evidence of FUN Trust's abuse of process claim. We note that the defendants have not appealed the trial court's ruling that they do not have any property rights over the cross-hatched area located on FUN Trust's property.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-25\">\n   In its cross-appeal, FUN Trust argues that the trial court erred: (1) in ruling that judicial privilege barred its claim against the defendants for slander of title; (2) by failing to award carrying costs, including property taxes, as damages in connection with its abuse of process claim; and (3) in denying its request for attorney's fees in connection with this litigation. We address each argument in turn.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-26\">\n   A\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-27\">\n   The defendants argue that the trial court erred in finding that they did not have a deeded right-of-way across Cuomo Drive, which runs over 392 South Broadway's property. The defendants do not appeal the trial court's ruling that the original easement reservation made by John A. Messer, who owned only a life estate in the dominant estate, would have terminated when the life estate ended. Rather, they argue that \"even if there was a life estate issue with the original easement grant, subsequent predecessors in title to 392 South Broadway specifically subjected what would become [its] property, to the easement or right-of-way.\" They argue that \"[t]he subsequent owners of the dominant and servient estates specifically intended to ratify, re-grant, re-accept and otherwise correct any defects in Mr. Messer's original reservation and grant.\" 392 South Broadway argues that this argument is not properly before us because it was not \"made before or during trial or directly considered by the Superior Court in any written or oral decision.\" We agree with 392 South Broadway.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-28\">\n   In their counterclaim, the defendants alleged only that their property \"benefit[s] from a right of way ... originally established by deed dated December 2, 1874,\" which is the deed from John A. Messer. They did not allege that, if the Messer deed failed to establish a perpetual right-of-way, subsequent deeds in 392 South Broadway's chain of title created the right-of-way independently of the Messer conveyance or that actions of subsequent purchasers provide a basis for ratification of, or otherwise correct defects in, the Messer deed. According to the defendants' own brief, this issue appears to have been first raised in its requests for rulings of law submitted at the end of the bench trial regarding the right-of-way. However, raising new allegations at such a late juncture conflicts with the purpose of notice pleading.\n   <em>\n    See Perron v. Aranosian\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4412027\" index=\"0\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nh/128/92/#p95\">\n    128 N.H. 92\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 95,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"1\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=508%20A.2d%201087\">\n    508 A.2d 1087\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1986) (finding that alternative\n   relief first raised in requests for rulings of law \"offended the elementary principle that must be enforced, even in this lenient jurisdiction, that pleadings must inform the opponent of the theory and relief sought\" (quotation and ellipsis omitted));\n   <em>\n    see also Thompson v. C&amp;C Research &amp; Dev.\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2506816\" index=\"2\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nh/153/446/#p451\">\n    153 N.H. 446\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 451-52,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"3\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=898%20A.2d%20495\">\n    898 A.2d 495\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2006).\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-29\">\n   Furthermore, in its order, the trial court did not address the argument made by the defendants regarding subsequent conveyances. This is consistent with its earlier denial of the defendants' request to amend its cross-complaint in order to broaden the scope of the litigation. The trial court specifically struck any allegations beyond those originally pleaded in the cross-complaint. We note that the defendants have not appealed this decision. Accordingly, we decline to address the defendants' claim that subsequent conveyances were sufficient to recreate or correct defects in the original reservation of the easement.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-30\">\n   The defendants also argue that 392 South Broadway should be judicially estopped from denying the existence of a deeded right-of-way over its property. Specifically, they argue that Edward Gordon, a principal of both 392 South Broadway and 412 South Broadway, admitted to the existence of the deeded right-of-way in a filing by 412 South Broadway. 392 South Broadway argues that the defendants failed to preserve this argument because the trial court did not address the argument in its order, and the defendants did not move for reconsideration or clarification of this issue.\n   <em>\n    See State v. Farnsworth\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4407051\" index=\"4\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nh/126/656/#p660\">\n    126 N.H. 656\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 660,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"5\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=497%20A.2d%20835\">\n    497 A.2d 835\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (1985). The defendants respond that they are \"not necessarily appealing the Trial Court's failure to make findings on judicial estoppel, [they are] appealing the Trial Court's implied denial and rejection of the arguments.\" Assuming without deciding that the issue is properly before us, we cannot say that the trial court erred, as a matter of law, by not applying judicial estoppel.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-31\">\n   In determining whether to apply the doctrine of judicial estoppel, a court considers, among other things, \"whether the party seeking to assert an inconsistent position would derive an unfair advantage or impose an unfair detriment on the opposing party if not estopped.\"\n   <em>\n    Cohoon v. IDM Software\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"2508304\" index=\"6\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nh/153/1/#p4\">\n    153 N.H. 1\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 4,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"7\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=891%20A.2d%20552\">\n    891 A.2d 552\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005) (quotation omitted). Even assuming that Gordon's statements were from the same \"party\"-despite being representations made on behalf of a completely separate entity-the defendants have failed to persuade us that 392 South Broadway derived an unfair advantage, or the defendants suffered an unfair detriment, by 392 South Broadway not being precluded from denying the existence of the right-of-way.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-32\">\n   In 2010, Cumberland Farms maintained that the defendants had no deeded right-of-way over its property. Additionally, contrary to the defendants' claim that Gordon made \"an eleventh-hour challenge\" to the validity of the right-of-way, 392 South Broadway denied that the defendants had a deeded right-of-way over its property when it was first brought into the case. The defendants' claim of deeded access across both Cumberland Farms and 392 South Broadway's properties arose from the same reservation by John A. Messer in 1874. Therefore, the defendants knew as far back as 2010, two years before 392 South Broadway became a party to this lawsuit, that they would be required to prove the existence of the deeded right-of-way. As such, the defendants were not prejudiced in any way, and 392 South Broadway gained no unfair advantage in connection with Gordon's statements.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-33\">\n   The defendants also advance numerous other theories of estoppel that do\n   not appear to have been addressed by the trial court. For instance, they argue that the facts of this case \"constitute[ ] an estoppel by deed and/or an estoppel by records and/or estoppel by recitals in instruments.\" Additionally, without citing any legal authority, the defendants allege that 392 South Broadway is estopped from denying the defendants' right-of-way due to the site plan applications filed by prior owners and because of the allegedly odd shape of the building on the property. Finally, they also argue that equitable estoppel applies to prevent 392 South Broadway from denying the validity of the right-of-way. However, because the defendants provide little legal analysis regarding these theories, we decline to address them.\n   <em>\n    Cf\n   </em>\n   .\n   <em>\n    Porter v. City of Manchester\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"5632921\" index=\"8\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nh/155/149/#p157\">\n    155 N.H. 149\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 157,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"9\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=921%20A.2d%20393\">\n    921 A.2d 393\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2007) (declining to review a party's argument where it failed to \"undertake a collateral estoppel analysis, or to develop its legal argument\");\n   <em>\n    see also State v. Fernandez\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"8420186\" index=\"10\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nh/152/233/#p239\">\n    152 N.H. 233\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 239-40,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"11\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=876%20A.2d%20221\">\n    876 A.2d 221\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2005) (\"[A] mere laundry list of complaints, without developed legal argument, is insufficient to warrant judicial review.\").\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-34\">\n   B\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-35\">\n   Next, the defendants argue that the trial court erred by failing to grant their motion to dismiss FUN Trust's abuse of process claim and by ruling against them on the merits of this claim. They argue that, under the doctrines of res judicata and/or collateral estoppel, FUN Trust's unsuccessful requests for attorney's fees, in both the trial court and this court, in connection with the 2012 planning board appeal, bars them from seeking redress for abuse of process. FUN Trust argues that the trial court did not err by denying the defendants' motion to dismiss, and that the prior attorney's fee requests are not controlling of the outcome of its abuse of process claim. Insofar as FUN Trust argues that the defendants did not properly raise res judicata and collateral estoppel in the trial court, we note that the trial court addressed the merits of both doctrines, and FUN Trust has not filed a cross-appeal asserting that it was error for the trial court to do so. Therefore, we conclude that the issue is properly before us.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-36\">\n   \"To determine whether the doctrine of claim preclusion, otherwise known as res judicata, applies here, we employ the familiar three-part test.\"\n   <em>\n    Merriam Farm, Inc. v.

R. Ev.\n   </em>\n   408 (excluding evidence of a \"covenant not to sue\").

However, FUN Trust fails to explain how or why the trial court erred in determining that property taxes or other carrying costs for the property during the period of the planning board appeal were not an adequate \"proxy\" for lost profits during the same period. Therefore, we are not persuaded that the trial court's exclusion of these amounts from its damages award was clearly erroneous.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-57\">\n   E\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-58\">\n   Next, in its cross-appeal, FUN Trust argues that the trial court erred when it found that the defendants were not liable for slander of title for statements made in conjunction with a 2012 planning board decision. The trial court found that the defendants' statements made \"in connection with the 2012 [planning board] Appeal [were] absolutely privileged from a claim of slander to title\" due to judicial privilege. FUN Trust concedes that the trial court \"correctly determined that statements made by [the defendants] in\n   the judicial context were absolutely privileged.\" However, it argues that the trial court erred because the court \"did not address the statements made by [the defendants] in the context of the Planning Board hearings, which statements also were slanderous to FUN's title.\" The defendants counter that FUN Trust never asserted that its claim of slander of title was based upon statements made before the planning board. We agree with the defendants.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-59\">\n   As quoted by the trial court, the only allegation FUN Trust made in its counterclaim about false statements made by the defendants was that \"[i]n connection with their\n   <em>\n    appeal of the 2012 Planning Board Decision\n   </em>\n   , [the defendants] willfully published false statements concerning the title of FUN Trust's property.\" (Emphasis added.) FUN Trust did not allege that the defendants made false statements before the planning board. In fact, even in its request for rulings of law on this issue, FUN Trust stated that the defendants \"claimed title to the cross-hatched area of the FUN Trust Property in\n   <em>\n    the 2012 Appeal\n   </em>\n   and in the Easement Litigation\" but does not mention the planning board proceedings. (Emphasis added.) Additionally, it does not appear from the record before us that FUN Trust ever brought this alleged oversight to the trial court's attention.\n   <em>\n    See Thompson v. D'Errico\n   </em>\n   ,\n   <extracted-citation case-ids=\"4146947\" index=\"54\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/nh/163/20/#p22\">\n    163 N.H. 20\n   </extracted-citation>\n   , 22,\n   <extracted-citation index=\"55\" url=\"https://cite.case.law/citations/?q=35%20A.3d%20584\">\n    35 A.3d 584\n   </extracted-citation>\n   (2011) (\"[I]t is a long-standing rule that parties may not have judicial review of matters not raised in the forum of trial.\"). Thus, we are not persuaded that the trial court erred by failing to address this argument. Given this conclusion, we need not address the defendants' argument that the trial court erred in failing to grant their motion to dismiss FUN Trust's slander of title claim.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-60\">\n   F\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-61\">\n   Finally, FUN Trust argues that the trial court erred \"when it determined that [the defendants] did not bring this action against [it] wantonly, maliciously, oppressively, or in bad faith, and also erred in declining to award [its] request for attorneys' fees based on the erroneous finding.\" \"Under the bad faith litigation theory, an award of attorney's fees is appropriate where one party has acted in bad faith, vexatiously, wantonly, or for oppressive reasons, where the litigant's conduct can be characterized as unreasonably obdurate or obstinate, and where it should have been unnecessary for the successful party to have brought the action.\"\n   <em>\n    Frost v.

In its order, the trial court recounted the testimony of witnesses that Cuomo Drive was once a \"sea of pavement\" and \"wider in the 1980s and 1990s than it is today,\" and referenced photographs submitted to the court demonstrating these facts. Given this evidence, the trial court could readily have found that, prior to litigation, it was unclear whether the defendants had gained rights to the cross-hatched area through years of continuous use. Therefore, we are not persuaded that the trial court unsustainably exercised its discretion when it found that FUN Trust was not entitled to attorney's fees.\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-63\">\n   III\n  </p>\n  <p id=\"p-64\">\n   For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the trial court's judgment on FUN Trust's\n   abuse of process claim and remand to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
