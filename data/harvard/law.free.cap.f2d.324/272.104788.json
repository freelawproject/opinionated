In our earlier opinion, cited in footnote 1. supra, we have stated the case sufficiently for an understanding of the present opinion. We have again carefully read and studied the four-volume record and the original exhibits in connection with the opinion of the district court and the briefs and arguments of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-5\">The district court held Crescent solely responsible for the damages sustained by the Natchez-Vidalia Bridge when the top of the after starboard leg of Dixilyn\u2019s Gargantuan off-shore drilling barge Julie Ann collided with the underside of the bridge. In more detail, it held: (1) that Crescent\u2019s Captain Brechtel \u201cwas in complete charge and control of the flotilla\u201d; (2) that \u201cCrescent was negligent in not furnishing sufficient power to hold the Julie Ann against the current when its legs were being extended to the required depth of 55 feet\u201d; (3) that \u201cthe Tug Orleans was unable to exert its full power because of a defective engine which failed at the crucial moment\u201d; (4) that Captain Brechtel \u201cwas also guilty of negligence in not completely stopping the flotilla and lowering the legs to a depth of 55 feet before it reached the Natchez bridge\u201d; (5) that \u201che was negligent in his failure to notify Hughes earlier when to lower the legs and in not stopping immediately after he crossed the rock ledge in order for Hughes to have lowered the legs to a depth of 55 feet\u201d; (6) \u201cHughes exercised reasonable care * * * and was guilty of no negligence that in any way contributed to the collision.\u201d Keeping in mind the clearly erroneous rule,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> we consider each of those findings in order.</p>\n<p id=\"b327-13\">(1) <em>Respective Duties of Brechtel and Hughes. </em>Captain Brechtel was in over-all charge of the flotilla, but Dixilyn\u2019s resident engineer Hughes was in command of its three and a half million dollar (R. 564) rig, the Julie Ann. Captain Brechtel had not arrived when the journey began at Vicksburg. Hughes gave the order to begin the trip.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> In describing his duties, Hughes testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-15\">\u201cQ. In connection with the movement from Vicksburg to New Orleans, what, if any, duties did you have aboard the drilling rig?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-16\">\u201cA. The duties were responsibility for the safety of the crew aboard, the people aboard the barge, and as representative of Dixilyn I was to, when the rig left shore at Vicksburg, then the rig was turned over to us; LeTourneau now released all holding on that rig at that time, and my responsibility was to operate and raise and lower those legs.\u201d (R. p. 532.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b327-17\">Captain Brechtel testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-18\">\u201cQ. You knew, did you not, Captain Brechtel, in connection with this flotilla that you were in complete control of it, insofar as navigation and the speed is concerned?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-19\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-20\">\u201cQ. You were in complete control of it except for the actual lowering of the legs at the time that you said it was proper to lower them? Isn\u2019t that true ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b327-21\">\u201cA. That\u2019s right.\u201d (R. p. 318.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"274\">*274</page-number>(2) <em>Power to Hold the Julie Ann. </em>While Dixilyn\u2019s experts and Crescent agreed that 6000 horsepower was sufficient to effect the movement (R. 160, 161), the final responsibility was that of Crescent.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The tugs furnished were the Toltec, horsepower 3,975, the Ouachita, horsepower 1,800, and the Orleans, horsepower 700, or an aggregate horsepower for the three of 6,475.</p>\n<p id=\"b328-5\">Captain Brechtel had been working on the river \u201cfrom deckhand to master\u201d since 1929 (R. 281, 282), that is, for nearly thirty years. His experience was such that he was agreed on in advance by all parties to be in charge of the movement.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Captain Brechtel thought the horsepower ample, and testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-6\">\u201cA. * * * I had brought the rig down previous to this, and we did not have the Toltec. We had simply the Ouachita and the tug Orleans, a rig similar in construction and as big, and we did the job with no trouble, and we did not have the Toltec. We stopped it above the bridge in the same spot. We lowered the legs, drifted through the bridge, and the whole thing, from beginning to end, was without incident, without the use of the Toltec.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-20\">\u201cQ. What was your river stage at Natchez at the time ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-21\">\u201cA. Well, that has been quite a while and off-hand, I would not know.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-22\">\u201cQ. You say that rig was just as big?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-23\">\u201cA. I\u2019d say that there was very little difference in it; not so much so you would need additional 4000 horsepower.\u201d (R. 342, 343.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b328-24\">Captain Clark of the large Tug Toltec testified: \u201cIt is my opinion that we did have sufficient horsepower.\u201d (R. 260.)</p>\n<p id=\"b328-25\">Captain Wilson was the master of the United States Engineering Corps sounding boat which was preceding the flotilla. He had been a master pilot for 20 or 22 years (R. 77). He was of the opinion that the tugs had sufficient power to handle the flotilla properly (R. 93, 98, 114).</p>\n<p id=\"b328-26\">As the tow approached the bridge, it became obvious that the legs might not clear. Mr. Hughes called for another <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"275\">*275</page-number>check on the <em>legs </em>and received a reply from the observer at the after starboard leg that its depth was 45 feet (instead of the required 55 feet). Captain Brechtel immediately ordered the tug boats full speed ahead (R. 305). Captain Clark, master of the large tug Toltec, estimated that when he received this order his tug was \u201capproximately 150 to 200 feet above the bridge\u201d (R. 236). It was then too late. Captain Brechtel testified that, \u201cI would say with an additional 4000 horsepower and on such a short notice, that we would not have been able to stop it within at least another half-mile of the river.\u201d (R. p. 331.)</p>\n<p id=\"b329-4\">The failure of the tugs to hold the Julie Ann on such short notice does not indicate that the power furnished was .insufficient to effect the movement. The decided weight of the evidence is that sufficient power was furnished.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-5\">(3) <em>Failure of Tug Orleans. </em>As has been stated, the Tug Orleans had 700 horsepower as compared with 1800 for the Ouachita and 3975 for the Toltec. The engine of the Tug Orleans failed either immediately before or immediately after it passed under the Natchez-Vi dalia Bridge.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-6\">Captain Shiroh and Chief Engineer Ricord of the Tug Orleans and Captain Brechtel testified that there was no failure of the engines on the Orleans until after they had crossed under the bridge. The engine log. book of the Orleans so indicates, but it also shows that work was done on the engine on December 21, 23, 25 and 26, prior to the collision, and that after the collision inspection revealed that the No. 8 cylinder had to be removed and the No. 2 piston had burst. The log book on the Toltec contained an entry \u201cTug Orleans 'engine stopped above bridge,\u201d which the master, Captain Clark, undertook to explain as entered upon hearsay information received after the accident. Mr. Wood\u2019s report, received in evidence because of Wood\u2019s death prior to the trial, reflected that the engine on the Orleans failed about 150 feet upstream from the bridge. Tidwell, Gill and Moody, employees of Dixilyn, furnished hearsay evidence that the engine failure was before passing the bridge.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-8\">On this question we would not hold that the finding of the district court was clearly erroneous. We do not, however, think that decision of the case turns on whether the Orleans\u2019 engine failed just before or just after the bridge was passed.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-9\">(4) <em>Failure to Test Holding Power with Legs Lowered to Required Depth of 55 Feet. </em>When the flotilla was abreast of Learned\u2019s Mill, about a mile or a mile and a quarter upstream from the bridge, Captain Brechtel asked Mr. Hughes to put the legs down to 35 feet. He then ordered the tugs to come full speed ahead, stopped the flotilla and held it until satisfied that the control was perfect. (Captain Brechtel, R. 292, 338; Captain Clark, R. 236; Mr. Hughes, R. 536, 540.) Captain Brechtel and Captain Clark testified that the rig was brought to a second stop at about the cable crossing, a quarter of a mile upstream from the bridge (Captain Brechtel, R. 294, Captain Clark, R. 245); that the rig was then held stopped in the water for 20 to 25 minutes (Captain Brechtel, R. 294, 295, 335; Captain Clark, R. 245, 247). According to Captain Brechtel, the legs were then lowered until Hughes reported that all three legs were at the required fifty-five feet (R. 298). Hughes testified differently, as will be discussed in considering the district court\u2019s next finding of negligence. If Hughes\u2019 testimony is accepted, we would agree that Captain Brechtel was negligent in failing to test the holding power with the legs lowered to the required depth of 55 feet. If the testimony of Captain Brechtel is accepted, such failure to test had no proximate causal connection with the collision. For reasons hereafter stated, we think that Captain Brechtel was testifying truth fully.</p>\n<p id=\"b329-10\">(5) <em>Failure to Notify Hughes to Lower Legs. </em>Hughes testified that after he obtained 36 or 37 feet of draft on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"276\">*276</page-number>three legs, he was never again ordered to lower the legs.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-4\">Hughes\u2019 testimony in that respect was corroborated by the testimony of Hollis Gill, a tool pusher for Dixilyn.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b330-5\">Lloyd T. Cotton, an employee of R. G. LeTourneau, introduced as a witness by Dixilyn, testified that Captain Brechtel ordered the legs lowered about 10 or 15 minutes after Hughes first requested permission to lower them (R. 488-490).</p>\n<p id=\"b330-6\">The credibility of the Hughes version is seriously impeached by a statement which he gave on the Coast Guard investigation, within a month after the accident, vouching for the facts as then stated by Captain Brechtel. Captain Brechtel\u2019s statement bearing Hughes\u2019 endorsement reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-7\">\u201cNew Orleans, La.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-8\">\u201c23 January 1958</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AKF\">\u201cStatement of John J.

All three were seated abreast in pushing position on the stem of the Julie Ann. The Toltec was in the middle, the Orleans on the stbd side and the Ouachita on the port side. An Army Engineers boat also named Orleans was proceeding ahead of us to report soundings as we approached the Natchez-Vidalia bridge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-15\">\u201cApproximately 450 ft. above the bridge there is a rock ledge in about 50 ft. of water which necessitated keeping the legs of the Drill Rig high in the air</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3m\">\u201cJohn J. Brechtel \u2018A\u2019(l)</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Am-\">\u201cp. 2</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-17\">until the ledge is crossed. After passing over the ledge the rig was swung around so that the tow boats could push ahead to counteract the effect of the current and hold the rig while the legs were lowered sufficiently to pass under the bridge. The legs were supposed to be lowered to a depth of 55 ft. to insure clearance under the bridge.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b330-18\">\u201cA man was stationed at each leg to report the depth to Mr. Hughes who was controlling their lowering from the control room. Mr. Hughes had asked for a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"277\">*277</page-number>report on the leg depths and received replies that each was at 55 feet. I then ordered the tow boats engines slowed to allow the tow to drift under the bridge. Just as we were approaching the bridge Mr. Hughes called for a recheck on the readings. The man on the port after leg answered 55 ft. and the man on the stbd leg gave 45 ft. The legs were still being lowered at the time but the rate of descent is only one foot per minute. I immediately ordered all boats full speed ahead but could not stop the tow</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-4\">\u201cJohn J.

I called his attention to the difference in the draft marks and he said, \u2018Well, if there\u2019s no more difference than that is, that will not make any difference.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-17\">\u201cQ. What do you mean, you \u2018called his attention\u2019?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-18\">\u201cA.

And you did say that you were in agreement with the facts stated therein?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-24\">\u201cA. With the exception of the draft reading.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b331-25\">\u201cQ.

As such, yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"278\">*278</page-number>\"Q. And you did not think when you signed this statement \u2014 I guess I had better rephrase that. You saw this statement that Captain Brechtel had said that there was a mis-reading reported to you, and you nevertheless were in agreement with those facts, without calling that to the attention of the Coast Guard ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-4\">\u201cA. I did call that to the attention of the Coast Guard officer.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-5\">\u201cQ. You did?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b332-6\"><em>\u201cA. </em>Yes. That was the question in the whole report that I didn\u2019t agree with, and because he was in a hurry to get through, he said that he didn\u2019t think it would be necessary to make out a statement in my words as long as he took it orally, and then gave me this one to look at.\u201d (R. pp. 555-558.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b332-7\">Even if Hughes\u2019 claimed correction of the statement were accepted, he nonetheless at that time corroborated Captain Brechtel\u2019s statement in all other respects. We are left under the firm impression that the facts were as stated by Captain. Brechtel to the Coast Guard and as testified to by him on the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-10\">(6) <em>Did Hughes Exercise Reasonable-Care? </em>As has been stated, Hughes admitted that \u201cmy responsibility was to operate and raise and lower those legs.\u201d' (R. 532.) Hughes could not see the draft marks himself but relied on reports given to him by Tidwell, who was in turn relaying the information from Dixilyn\u2019s-. employees stationed at each of the three legs. (Tidwell, R. 404; Hughes, R. 544, 548, 549.) Hughes knew that \u201cwe would have to get the legs down approximately fifty-five or sixty foot to clear the bridge\u201d (R. 534).

The distance from \u201cP\u201d to \u201cW\u201d was 10 to 12 feet, and from \u201cW\u201d to \u201cB\u201d was 12 to 14 feet (R. 551).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-4\">The men stationed at the legs read the draft marks at point <em>\u201cP\u201d </em>and called that information to Tidwell, who relayed it on to Hughes, except that \u201che at times, on several occasions that he gave me the draft he would give me the reading of the leg, the footage on the leg that was in the water, and then make his correction by adding the draft of the barge to it.\u201d (R. 548.) (See also Tidwell\u2019s testimony at pp. 404-406 of record.) Hughes\u2019 testimony on cross-examination revealed a complete misconception in the term \u201cdraft\u201d (see R. pp. 547-553), and culminated as follows;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-5\">\u201cQ. When you said there would be a draft of fifty-five or sixty feet to go under the bridge, what did you mean by that draft? Did you mean a reading of a draft at point \u2018P\u2019 or a reading of a draft at \u2018W\u2019 on the sketch?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-6\">\u201cA. A reading at point \u2018P\\</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-7\">\u201cQ. At point T\u2019?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-8\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-9\">\u201cQ. Now, how much of the leg then would be on top of the water line if you had a fifty-five foot draft at point \u2018P\u2019?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-10\">\u201cA. With fifty-five foot at point *P\u2019 there would be approximately sixty-five foot in the water, and with a one hundred forty-three foot total length that would leave about seventy-five foot or eighty foot above the water with fifty-five foot in the water.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-15\">\u201cQ. And so on that basis, you were perfectly content to proceed through the bridge with a fifty-five foot draft on point \u201cP\u201d ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-16\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-17\">\u201cQ. Because you would have plenty of clearance?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-18\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.\u201d (R. pp. 552, 553.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-19\">That testimony showed, we think, that the cause of the collision could be simply explained by the failure of Hughes properly to call the draft of the legs to Captain Brechtel.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-20\">Notwithstanding that devastating cross-examination, on re-direct Dixilyn\u2019s able proctor, perhaps wisely, asked Plughes but a single question:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-21\">\u201cQ. Mr. Hughes, how long were you delayed in departing from Vicksburg?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b333-22\">\u201cA. Almost two hours.\u201d (R. p. 567.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b333-23\">If Hughes were simply confused, or if there were any other explanation for his apparent misconception, there remained ample opportunity to recall Tidwell, or to call one or more of Dixilyn\u2019s employees stationed at the three legs. That was not done, even though the proctors had previously on several occasions discussed the applicable presumption (see R. 202, 347). Dixilyn\u2019s failure to produce these important witnesses raises the presumption or inference that their testimony would probably have been unfavorable to Dixilyn.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b333-24\">Dixilyn is liable to Crescent for the amount, with interest and costs, paid by Crescent to the libelants.

[Mr. Hughes] As I said, with consultation \u2014 after consultation with Mr. Tidwell [also Dixilyn\u2019s employee] and myself, with the decision being made by the two of us, the order was given by me that we would proceed down river.</p>\n<p id=\"Al1\">\u201cQ. That was a joint decision but the actual order to proceed was yours? Is that it?</p>\n<p id=\"AtK\">\u201cA. Yes, that\u2019s right.\u201d (R. p. 565.) See also record p. 225, where Captain Clark of the large Tug Toltec testified:</p>\n<p id=\"AdK\">\u201cQ. Who gave the orders to get underway?</p>\n<p id=\"A0k\">\u201cA. [Captain Clark] The same gentleman that I referred to to begin with. I believe I called his name as Mr. Hughes, and he was the one giving the orders.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b328-7\">. Crescent\u2019s Vice President, William S. Smith, Jr., testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-8\">\u201cQ. You were holding yourselves out to Dixilyn to be expert in the towage, not only in barges and harbor towing, but as an expert in performing this particular towing?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-9\">\u201cA. Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-10\">\u201cQ. Prom your particular experience?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-11\">\u201cA. Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-12\">\u201cQ. And you went to them not asking them for the advice as to the amount of horsepower that ought to be used in this tow?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-13\">\u201cA. We went to them and made suggestions as to the horsepower that should be used, that is correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-14\">\u201cQ. And actually Dixilyn asked you for the amount of horsepower that you thought ought to be used in connection with this towage?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-15\">\u201cA. Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-16\">\u201cQ. They asked you in your capacity as an expert tower, did they not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-17\">\u201cA. Correct.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-18\">\u201cQ. And you expected them to rely on the recommendations you made with respect to the horsepower?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ary\">\u201cA. That is correct. We were all in agreement when we left there.\u201d (R. 164, 165.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b328-28\">. Crescent\u2019s Vice President Smith testified:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-29\">\u201cQ. Was any discussion had about the personnel who was to be on the Crescent vessel involved, or vessels, involved in this movement?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-30\">\u201cA. We were asked if Captain Rrechtel would be available to go on this movement, and we assured them we would make him available to come down with the tow.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-31\">\u201cQ. What was Brechtel\u2019s special involvement in this?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-32\">\u201cA. He was to coordinate the movement of the three vessels in bringing the rig down.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-33\">\u201cQ. What was his experience involved in towing rigs down-river?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-34\">\u201cA. Well, this was to be the third one he had towed down, and he holds a license all the way up to Cairo, St. Louis. He has been on river towing.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-35\">\u201cQ. He had handled the prior tows Crescent had brought down?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b328-36\">\u201cA. That is correct.\u201d (R. 151, 152.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b330-11\">. \u201cQ. As you approached the bridge, Mr. Hughes, was there any conversation between you and Captain Brechtel with respect to the starting of the lowering of those legs?</p>\n<p id=\"b330-12\">\u201cA. Well, as we approached the bridge with the logs extended below the barge to this predetermined setting, we began to pick up a little more momentum, and I became concerned and asked Captain Brechtel for the first time if he was rea\u00a1dy to start lowering those legs, and he said, \u2018No, hold it for a little while longer.\u2019 So I held up for approximately four or five minutes. It\u2019s hard to judge time there when you are waiting tensely for something to occur. And then I asked him again, and he said, \u2018No, just hold up for a little while longer.\u2019 And so I held up until I saw the danger of the situation, that we were picking up too much speed in regard to the barge moving toward the bridge, and that, of course wasn\u2019t from my water knowledge or tow knowledge at all; it was just merely from observation and judging the distance and the momentum of the rig. So I looked around and there was still no inclination whatsoever that I start lowering the legs, but I did start lowering the legs.</p>\n<p id=\"AyGP\">\u201cQ. Did you ever get an order from Captain Brechtel to start lowering those legs before you started them?</p>\n<p id=\"AqL\">\u201cA. No, sir.</p>\n<p id=\"Ao2\">\u201cQ. You did that on your own initiative?</p>\n<p id=\"ABL\">\u201cA. I did that on my own initiative.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ADC\">(R. 537, 538.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"8\">\n<p id=\"b330-25\">. \u201cQ. Did you overhear any reguest made by Mr. Hughes of Captain Brechtel to permit him to start lowering the legs?</p>\n<p id=\"b330-26\">\u201cA. Yes, he asked if he wasn\u2019t ready to start lowering them, and he said, \u2018No, let\u2019s wait a minute.\u2019 In a short time he said, \u2018You can go ahead and start lowering them.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"b330-28\">\u201cQ. Did you observe Mr. Hughes start lowering the legs at that time?</p>\n<p id=\"b330-29\">\u201cA. Yes, sir, when he started lowering the legs I left the control tower.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b330-30\">(R. 425, 426.)</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"9\">\n<p id=\"b333-11\">. Clifton v.
