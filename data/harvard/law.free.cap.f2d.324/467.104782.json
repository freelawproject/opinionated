C. Penney Co., Inc., in the amount of $10,-000. Both parties have appealed. The plaintiff asserts that the amount of the jury\u2019s verdict was reduced because of the errors and the improper actions of the trial judge as set out hereinafter. The latter charge constitutes a most serious accusation. Penney insists that there was not sufficient evidence to support a verdict against it.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b524-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number>The complaint alleged that Mrs. Sleek was injured because Penney negligently permitted wrapping cord to gather on&gt; the floor of its store and this caused her to trip and fall. The following appears from the evidence offered by the plaintiff in her case in chief. On January 5, 1955, Mrs. Sleek, accompanied by her daughter, Mrs. DeFinis, her daughter-in-law, Mrs. Demor, and Mrs. DeFinis\u2019 daughter, Donna Jean Hughes, went to the Penney department store in Monroeville, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. The purpose of this excursion was to purchase sheets at the Penney January \u201cWhite Sale.\u201d While in the store, Mrs. DeFinis made a purchase, and as Mrs. Sleek was tabulating the sales slip for her, Mrs. Demor called to Mrs. Sleek from a point near a low platform or lowboy, described in the next paragraph. Mrs. Sleek testified that she turned to join her daughter-in-law and her right foot became entangled with something. This threw her off balance and after a futile attempt to regain her equilibrium, she fell heavily. After her fall she discovered wrapping cord on her shoe, which was the same as cord found in the aisle of the store, and was traced back to a spindle on or near a counter or platform.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-4\">Three of Penney\u2019s employees testified in its defense. All stated that there was a low platform' or low-boy, perhaps five feet long, about five inches high and three to four feet broad, close to the spot where the plaintiff fell. One of these witnesses, Walker, testified that he heard a thud and that \u201c[Mrs. Sleek] had stumbled over this lower platform. I had thought that was what it was. * * * There was nothing else that would have made a thud.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b524-5\">Despite the fact that the plaintiff had proceeded with her case in chief on the theory that her foot had become entangled \u00edn the defendant\u2019s wrapping cord, nonetheless at the close of the defendant\u2019s case the plaintiff sought to introduce a new theory of liability: i. e., that Penney was negligent in making use of the low platform or low-boy in such a position that the plaintiff could fall over it. Her counsel moved to amend her complaint to conform to the evidence as provided by Rule 15(b), Fed.R.Civ.Proc., 28 U.S.C. This motion was refused and the plaintiff claims this constituted prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-7\">We cannot agree. Since this is a diversity case, we must look to the law of Pennsylvania to determine Penney\u2019s liability. Dill v. Scuka, 279 F.2d 145,147 (3 Cir. 1960). Under Pennsylvania law the \u201cjury may not be permitted to reach its verdict merely on the basis of speculation or conjecture.\u201d Smith v. Bell Telephone Company of Pennsylvania, 397 Pa. 134, 138, 153 A.2d 477, 479 (1959). Even assuming that Walker\u2019s testimony, largely based on sound rather than sight, was sufficient, there was no evidence offered to show that the low-boy was improperly or negligently placed by Penney on the floor of the store. It is clear, therefore, that the court below committed no reversible error in rejecting the proffered amendment. See Stephens v. Reed, 121 F.2d 696, 699 (1941), in which this court said: \u201cThe court\u2019s refusal of these amendments was * * * not an abuse of discretion. There can be no abuse when what is refused would avail the offeror nothing if allowed.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b524-8\">The next point raised by the plaintiff is that the court below erred in refusing to admit certain expert medical evidence which the plaintiff insists would tend to prove that certain drugs, Flexin and Thoricin, prescribed for her by her doctors because of injuries resulting from her fail gave her hepatitis. According to the offer of testimony made by the plaintiff, it could have been shown that these drugs have been withdrawn from the market as causing this disease. The court refused to receive this evidence on the ground that it did not possess the certainty required by Pennsylvania evidentiary rules. See Wargo v. Pittsburgh Railways Co., 376 Pa. 168, 172-173, 101 A.2d 638, 640 (1954). The plaintiff\u2019s argument is based in part on Rule 43(a), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"471\">*471</page-number>Fed.R.Civ.Proe.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> She points out also that Section 597, Restatement, Conflict of Laws, states that \u201cthe law of the forum determines the admissibility of a particular piece of evidence,\u201d that the Supreme Court held in Sentilles v. Inter-Caribbean Shipping Corp., 361 U.S. 107, 109, 80 S.Ct. 173, 175, 4 L.Ed.2d 142 (1959), a Jones Act case, that \u201c[t]he matter [of sufficiency of expert testimony] does not turn on the use of a particular form of words by the physicians \u25a0in giving their testimony,\u201d and finally, \u25a0that this court has applied a seemingly \u25a0equivalent rule in F. E. L. A. decisions. See Neff v. Pennsylvania R.R. Co., 7 F.R.D. 532, 534 (E.D.Pa.1948), affirmed, 173 F.2d 931 (3 Cir. 1949). She seeks to bolster her position in this, the case .at bar, a diversity case, by citing as authority Carlson v. Chisholm-Moore Hoist Corp., 281 F.2d 766, 771-72 (1960), cert. denied, 364 U.S. 883, 81 S.Ct. 172, 5 L.Ed.2d 104 (1960), where the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, relying largely on Rule 43(a), allowed expert \u25a0opinion evidence although the evidentiary rules of New York, in which the \u25a0federal trial court sat, seemingly would .have excluded it. But the offer of proof as to the cause of Mrs. Sleek\u2019s hepatitis was in our view insufficient under any rule to make it available in the case at bar. One doctor testified, for example, \u201cto the possibility of indirect possibility\u201d of the plaintiff\u2019s hepatitis being \u2022 caused by the drugs. The strongest testimony on this issue was given by Dr. Maier Tuchler of Phoenix, Arizona, who was called by the plaintiff as an expert in the fields of neurology and psychiatry. He testified that the two drugs, Flexin and Thoricin, were \u201csuspected\u201d of causing hepatitis, but he also stated that there were two kinds of hepatitis, one \u25a0 caused by infection and the other by drug reaction. The most that can be said for Dr. Tuchler\u2019s statements in this connection, on which the plaintiff\u2019s offer was based, was that she had parenchymal<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> hepatitis but, Dr. Tuchler went on to say that \u201cyou cannot determine which [type of hepatitis] is infectious and which is due to drug reaction.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\"> There was of course a possibility that the plaintiff\u2019s illness could have been caused by the administration of drugs but even under the most liberal construction of what the witnesses said whether the plaintiff\u2019s hepatitis was infectious or caused by drugs was left completely <em>in nubibus. </em>There was no offer to prove that it was not infectious hepatitis, i. e., caused by a non-sterile needle or perhaps by food organisms. In addition, there was no offer of testimony as to what the plaintiff\u2019s dosage of either drug had been and the matter was left in the area of speculation. We are still of the view that in a diversity case where the sufficiency of the evidence goes to the maintenance of the substantive right, as here, the law of the state must prevail. Moran v. Pittsburgh-Des Moines Steel Co., 166 F.2d 908, 917 (3 Cir. 1948), cert. denied, 334 U.S. 846, 68 S.Ct. 1516, 92 L.Ed. 1770 (1948); Waldron v. Aetna Casualty &amp; Surety Co., 141 F.2d 230, 234 (3 Cir. 1944). There was lacking here not only the reasonable medical certainty required by the law of Pennsylvania but the offer of testimony possessed insufficient probative value to permit it to go to the jury even under the most general rule of admissibility. The trial court did not err in rejecting the offer as made.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">The plaintiff next insists that the court below erred in failing to enforce its own pretrial rules when it did not require the defendant to file a narrative state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"472\">*472</page-number>ment, disclose names of witnesses, and furnish medical reports of examining doctors. Specifically she asserts that the fact that Penney did not file a Pretrial Narrative Statement as required by Rule 5(11), subd. C, par. 3 of the court below <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> was gravely prejudicial and that she was prejudiced further because her request, made almost at the close of her case, to require the defendant to produce a report or a copy of a report of an examination made by a Dr. Carpenter who had examined the plaintiff prior to trial at the request of Penney\u2019s insurance carrier, was not granted. A brief recital of the pertinent facts is necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">The record reveals that a pretrial conference had been scheduled in this case for Thursday, January 11, 1962 before Judg'e Rabe F. Marsh, Jr. In a letter dated December 29, 1961, plaintiff\u2019s counsel, Mr. McArdle, had requested Judge Marsh to postpone the pretrial conference and the filing of the required stipulation of facts until a few weeks after he returned to Pittsburgh, he being then about to leave the city. He stated that Penney\u2019s counsel, Mr. Martin, had agreed to the postponement and would so stipulate. Probably because of this letter, the apparent stipulation and Mr. Mc-Ardle\u2019s coming absence,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Judge Marsh entered an order on January 4, 1962, dispensing with the pretrial conference and directing that the case be listed for trial in the week of January 29, 1962. Judge Marsh\u2019s action of dispensing with the pretrial procedures referred to was authorized by Rule 5(11), subd. H of the Rules of Court of the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">What the plaintiff\u2019s counsel did in effect was to dispense with pretrial and its aids, such as the narrative statement of his adversary as to the facts which would be offered by it, statements as to the oral or documentary evidence, and medical reports and the names of witnesses and classifications of witnesses to be called. He went ahead with the trial without this assistance and was content to do so. He made no complaint as to his failure to get a copy of Dr. Carpenter\u2019s report until the court had refused to exclude from evidence certain references in a damaging letter from Dr. Stuart N. Rowe, a neurosurgeon at the West Penn Hospital who had treated the plaintiff, a matter we shall deal with next in this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-10\">It is not clear upon what ground the plaintiff\u2019s counsel claims error, but in any event we cannot say that under the circumstances the trial court abused its discretion in refusing to compel Penney\u2019s counsel to produce the Carpenter report though many judges might well have reacted more responsively to Mr. McArdle\u2019s request. But, as we stated before, it was late in -the plaintiff\u2019s case when the motion was made. Doubtless a way could have been found to get the report into the record if the plaintiff\u2019s counsel had wished to do so. He could <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"473\">*473</page-number>have made use of a subpoena duces tecum, but if he did so, he took the chance of bringing into evidence a document prepared by his adversary\u2019s insurance carrier which might have proved damaging to his case. Under the circumstances at bar we cannot hold that the trial judge\u2019s refusal to permit the plaintiff\u2019s counsel to inspect Dr. Carpenter\u2019s report constituted prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\"> We come next to the plaintiff\u2019s assertion that it was prejudicial error to permit Dr. William C. Wycoff, one of the plaintiff\u2019s doctors, to read into the record the contents of a letter setting out a report received from Dr. Rowe by Dr. Wycoff and used by the latter as one of the bases for his medical opinion of the plaintiff\u2019s condition. After almost all of the contents of the letter had been read into evidence without valid objection, the defendant\u2019s counsel asked Dr. Wycoff: \u201cWill you tell us what your interpretation of Dr. Rowe\u2019s report was in that report to Mr. McArdle [the plaintiff\u2019s counsel] ?\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s counsel objected on the ground that the answer to the question would not be the best evidence and seemingly also that it would be hearsay. The record is very far from clear on this point and the plaintiff\u2019s argument is equally cloudy but it seems that the question was not answered. The trial court so states in its opinion. The generalized objection or objections of the plaintiff\u2019s counsel on the grounds indicated came only at the time stated. Nothing of consequence occurred after the objection was made. If an objection made during the course of a trial is to be valid on appeal, the party offering the objection must make a clear record in respect to the issue in the trial court. An appellate tribunal cannot speculate as to what was or was not done or what was or was not said in the court below. The record here will not support the plaintiff\u2019s contention of error.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">The plaintiff\u2019s next point is unusual. She claims she is entitled to a new trial because, to quote her brief: \u25a0\u201cThe Court Erred in Excluding Plaintiff\u2019s Offer of Proof of the Cost of Food in Arizona, and by Limiting Plaintiff\u2019s Damages to the Increased Cost of Living.\u201d We think the plaintiff has overlooked what is in the record. This is as follows.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-8\">\u201cMr. McArdle [the plaintiff\u2019s counsel] : Your Honor, not the cost of living, the cost of rental. <em>No charge for food, </em>no charge for gas and electricity. * * * If that is <em>food </em>there, that is our mistake.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-9\">\u201cThe Court: \u2014 Then on the front of this you are offering the airplane fare, the taxi, and you have <em>food </em>at $10.00 a day. What is that? $15.00 at 10 days\u2014</p>\n<p id=\"b527-10\">\u201cMr. McArdle: \u2014 -That is an oversight, Your Honor. That should be deleted. We had intended to delete it. Actually, I think she is entitled to the food if it is on the trip, but we are not going to quibble over it.\u201d (Emphasis added throughout.)</p>\n<p id=\"b527-11\">The plaintiff has no appealable issue here.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-12\">The plaintiff also alleges that the trial court improperly restricted her cross-examination of Robert W. Walker, who at the time of the accident was employed by Penney as a department manager. Walker testified on direct examination as stated in substance at an earlier point in this opinion, that he was about eight feet from the plaintiff when she fell and that he had heard a \u201cthud\u201d as if the plaintiff had stumbled over the low-boy. Walker was walking from the front to the back of the store. The fact situation is not entirely clear but it would appear that when Walker turned he saw the plaintiff stumbling before her fall.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-13\">On cross-examination the plaintiff attempted to ascertain why Walker was where he said he was at the time of her fall. Walker had testified that he might have left his department in the back of the store'to approve a check offered by a customer or to make an adjustment for a customer. \u25a0 The plaintiff then asked: \u201cHow would they tell you to come up to okay a check? Why wouldn\u2019t they seek you out since you were at the Shoe Department?\u201d The court did not allow this question to be answered. The plain<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"474\">*474</page-number>tiff contends that she was entitled to hear the details of why Walker was in the position he said he was in. Her brief states: \u201cIf his reason for being in that position was unsatisfactory or if his narrative was incoherent, the jury would have been entitled to disregard his testimony.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s counsel made no formal objection to the court\u2019s refusal to permit the question. He asked: \u201cYour Honor limits me on cross?\u201d The court replied: \u201cNo, I am not limiting you, but I am keeping you on the subject of probative value. This is beyond cross-examination. I like to keep on the issues. I have always tried to do that.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">The court was in error in restricting cross-examination at this point. But we cannot say that it was so gi-avely prejudicial as to warrant a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">Following a colloquy between the court and the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, Walker was then asked if he examined the floor after the plaintiff fell. He answered that he did not make an examination at that time. Later the witness testified that there was no string on the floor when he did examine it. The plaintiff then attempted to cross-examine Walker in regard to an answer to an interrogatory by Penney which had been read into the record earlier in that day\u2019s proceedings. The answer to the interrogatory was to the effect that string had been found on the floor near to where the plaintiff fell immediately after her fall. The plaintiff then asked if Walker was present in court when the answer had been read. The witness answered that he was not. At this point the court stopped this line of questioning. The plaintiff\u2019s counsel protested that the court was unduly limiting cross-examination and now contends that the action of the court deprived the plaintiff of her right to point up the contradiction between Walker\u2019s testimony and Penney\u2019s answer to -the interrogatory. But the contradiction, if there was such, had already been demonstrated. The plaintiff was in a position to argue the inconsistency fully to the jury. But nonetheless the court ruled too restrictively here. It is true that the bounds of proper cross-examination must necessarily lie within the sound discretion of the trial court, United States v. Stoehr, 196 F.2d 276, 280 (3 Cir. 1952), cert. denied, 344 U.S. 826, 73 S.Ct. 28, 97 L.Ed. 643 (1952), but as was stated by Chief Judge Gourley in the court below in Cleland v. Peters, 73 F.Supp. 769, 773 (D.C.1947), citing Short v. Allegheny Trust Co., 330 Pa. 55, 198 A. 793 (1938): \u201c[C]ross-examination of a witness may embrace any matter germane to the direct examination, qualifying or destroying it, or tending to develop facts which, have been improperly suppressed or ignored by the party who was called as a. witness.\u201d While we are of the opinion that the district court was too restrictive in curtailing cross-examination, we cannot perceive how the error was sufficiently prejudicial to warrant a reversal of the judgment on this ground alone. Cf. District of Columbia v. Clawans, 300 U.S. 617, 632, 57 S.Ct. 660, 81 L.Ed. 843 (1937).</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">Later in the cross-examination Walker was asked about the plaintiff\u2019s granddaughter, Donna Jean Hughes, who had been injured slightly when her grandmother fell. Inquiry was made of Walker as to whether he knew that Penney had replaced Donna Jean\u2019s coat which had been torn in the accident. This question was objected to and the objection sustained. The plaintiff then asked: \u201cWell, in connection with the little girl\u2019s injury, was anything done for her by you ?\u201d This line of questioning properly was stopped by the court. It was irrelevant and if permitted to continue might, have been prejudicial to the defendant.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-8\">We must now deal with the most troublesome aspect of the plaintiff\u2019s appeal. She asserts categorically and expressly that she is entitled to a new trial because the court below conducted the trial in an atmosphere of hostility and prejudice not only to the plaintiff but also to the plaintiff\u2019s counsel. The plaintiff\u2019s brief contains the following statement which was reiterated in the oral argument before this court: \u201cAt the Pre-Trial stage of this case, the Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>entered a default order dismissing the action with prejudice for plaintiff\u2019s failure to timely file a Pre-Trial Statement. The decision of the Court was appealed to the Third Circuit, where, in a decision written by Judge Hastie, the case was reinstated and the dismissed order was reversed. Sleek v. J. C. Penney, 292 F.2d 256, 3rd Cir. This reversal has caused the trial judge to treat the instant case with hostility.\u201d The plaintiff\u2019s attorney had long been in default in filing the pretrial statement required by Rule 5(11) of the rules of the court below, despite repeated warnings. An examination of the opinion of this court will demonstrate that we held that the trial judge was in error in concluding that he was without power to consider an application made by the plaintiff for relief under Rule 60(b), Fed.R.Civ.Proc., 28 U.S.C., from the order dismissing the action with prejudice because the trial court erroneously had reached the conclusion that the ten-day provision of Rule 59 limited the time for making a Rule 60(b) application. We reversed and remanded the ease to the end that the court below could consider whether there was excusable neglect and reinstate the suit. The court below upon remand reinstated the action but ordered the plaintiff\u2019s counsel to pay into the registry of the court $1,000 as counsel fees to the defendant\u2019s counsel. The fee has been paid by the plantiff\u2019s counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-4\">So much for background. We shall now deal with the areas in which the plaintiff asserts hostility and prejudice were shown by the court.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">The plaintiff insists that the court examined Dr. John W. Harmeir, one of her witnesses, in a hostile and prejudicial manner. Dr. Harmeir had testified in substance that the climate of Arizona was beneficial to the plaintiff\u2019s arthritis. The colloquy between the court and Dr. Harmeir is set out below.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-6\">\u201cThe Court : Just what are the changes in this area that have to do with this, doctor ? How do they play a part in the possible disability of this plaintiff ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-8\">\u201cThe Witness -I think that most of fis that have arthritic problems are worse in weather, whether it be ordinary arthritis or traumatic arthritis, we are worse in damp weather and cold weather than we are in the warm climate, warm, dry climate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-9\">\u201cThe Court: \u2014 It helps the arthritis then; is that it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-10\">\u201cThe Witness : \u2014 Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-11\">\u201cThe Court: \u2014 As distinct from any muscles or bones?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-12\">\u201cThe Witness : \u2014 -The muscles, too, absolutely. If you have any rheumatic condition, then that covers the whole field of muscles, bones and joints and so on. You are better in a warm, dry climate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-13\">\u201cThe Court :\u25a0 \u2014 Where are those warm, dry climates in this country?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-14\">\u201cThe Witness : \u2014 Well, I think that Arizona is one. I think Southern California, on the desert is one. Some people feel better in Florida. It all depends.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-15\">\u201cThe Court : \u2014 Most of us feel better in those climates anyway.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-16\">\u201cThe Witness : \u2014 Even in the summer I think you might feel all right there too.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-17\">\u201cThe Court: \u2014 In the winter, certainly.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-18\">\u201cThe Witness : \u2014 Certainly in the winter.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-19\">\u201cThe Court: \u2014 Regardless.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-20\">\u201cThe Witness : \u2014 Yes, that is true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-21\">\u201cThe Court: \u2014 Arthritis or not you still would feel better in Arizona if you were there today, arthritis or not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-22\">\u201cThe Witness : \u2014 That is probably true.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b529-23\">\u201cThe Court : \u2014 In other words, we hear people say various things, say them today, one day or two days, that today is a dry day and praise it, it doesn\u2019t bother a person as much as it did the other day when it was raining. You feel aches in your bones those days this time of year, chiefly in weather like here, the weather here locally.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b529-24\">Were these inquiries by the trial judge prejudicial to the plaintiff\u2019s case? We think the answer must be that they were not. It can be argued that the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>judge\u2019s interrogation did not go far toward clarifying any issue or correcting any misunderstanding of the testimony. But we are far from certain that such a position would be a correct one. The trial judge was in effect exploring the views of the witness as to the effect of Arizona\u2019s dry climate on the plaintiff\u2019s health generally. It will be borne in mind that the plaintiff was contending that it was necessary for her to go to Arizona to improve her arthritic condition and that she was suing to recover some of the expenses incurred by her in traveling.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">The plaintiff next complains of an interrogation of Dr. Tuchler by the court. Dr. Tuchler had testified as a psychiatrist that the depression from which the plaintiff suffered was a by-product of her accident. The interrogation during cross-examination in pertinent part was as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-5\">\u201cThe Court: \u2014 How does the patient himself determine whether he needs psychiatric treatment? How does he determine it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-6\">\u201cThe Witness: \u2014 Most people don\u2019t make that determination, Your Honor.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-7\">\u201cThe Court: \u2014 Some other doctor sends him to you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-8\">\u201cThe Witness : \u2014 There are many people desperately sick that would be the last person to see a psychiatrist. These are the paranoid, suspicious people.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-9\">\u201cThe Court: \u2014 People like most of us walking around, how can we tell if ought if we ought to see a psychiatrist?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-10\">\u201cThe Witness: \u2014 If your agony gets sufficient and you want a little relief, and you hope the doctor can help you. The doctor helps you to help yourself. He cannot do a great deal, perhaps from a point of view of something he can give you or help you with a philosophy of life.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-11\">\u201cThe Court:- \u2014 Do you have people walk in? I mean, this is while\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-12\">\u201cThe Witness : \u2014 No I do not.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-13\">\u201cThe Court:- \u2014 -Do you have people walk in off the street and state that they think they ought to see a psychiatrist?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-14\">\u201cThe Witness : \u2014 Not often. I only see a referable practice. However, when you do have people walking in, you frequently have people with minor disturbances. They should be with a medical man rather than with a psychiatrist.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-15\">\u201cThe Court: \u2014 Isn\u2019t it true, though, that a person with a long history of illness of various kinds, maybe some of them with falls or some brought on by various things, aren\u2019t they apt to be depressed just because of a whole series of incidents that happened to them?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-16\">\u201cThe Witness : \u2014 Yes, that is where the 50 per cent of a practice of general medicine done by an average general practitioner is * * * practicing psychiatry. The average general practitioner does not see medical cases. Over the majority of his cases are functional, have to do with emotions.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-17\">\u201cThe Court : \u2014 How in this case can you separate, we will say, and attribute her depression to a fall here when she has this record ? I assume you know it, you have the history, she has had so many things, illnesses, various things, gall bladder operation, a toe removed, headaches, a little heart trouble, and all that sort of thing, how do you tie it down to one thing now?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-18\">\u201cThe Witness : \u2014 It can be done.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-19\">\u201cThe Court: \u2014 Do you think you can do it?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b530-20\">\u201cThe Witness: \u2014 Yes.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b530-21\">The trial judge in our opinion was examining the doctor, an expert in psychiatry, as to whether or not he could pinpoint the plaintiff\u2019s fall in Penney\u2019s store as the cause of her depressive reaction, in the light of the several other physical ills from which she had suffered. The substance of Dr. Tuchler\u2019s answer was that he could pinpoint the fall as the cause of the plaintiff\u2019s depression. We can perceive no basis for sound criticism of the judge\u2019s conduct here. The judge clearly had a right to ask the questions that he did. As we said, albeit in another connection in American Cyanamid Company v. Sharff, 309 F.2d 790, 798 (3 Cir., 1962): \u201cThe trial court should not deem itself to be \u2018a mere keeper of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>the ring' in the tradition of the English civil law.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b531-4\">The plaintiff\u2019s next contention is that the court\u2019s interrogation of her was unfair and prejudicial. We have examined this interrogation several times\u2014 as we have all the others \u2014 and we conclude that the charge is unfounded. The trial judge, in our opinion, was merely trying to straighten out the confusion in the plaintiff\u2019s own testimony.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">The plaintiff also asserts that the trial court disparaged her counsel before the jury. Again it is necessary to set out the testimony and some background. Dr. Tuchler was testifying on cross-examination and he was asked to find and to examine a report made by one of the plaintiff\u2019s doctors. The precise nature of the report is not pertinent here. Mr. Martin, the defendant\u2019s counsel asked: \u201c[I]t refers, does it not, to an examination which had been done earlier by Dr. Stuart N. Rowe?</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-6\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-7\">\u201cQ. Does * * * [it] give the date of the examination by Dr. Stuart N. Rowe?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-8\">\u201cA. It does not sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-9\">\u201cQ. But it does refer to the patient as \u2014 if you turn to the first page of the letter and first sentence of the last paragraph, beginning on the first page, it refers to her as an enigma; is that right?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-10\">\u201cMr. McArdle: \u2014 If the Court please. We have the report of Dr. Rowe to Dr. Wycoff. We have that rather than Dr. Wycoff\u2019s reference to it which we will offer to counsel.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-11\">\u201cMr. Martin: \u2014 I have a copy of the report.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-12\">\u201cThe Court: \u2014 He has a copy.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-13\">\u201cMr. McArdle: \u2014 Of the original report?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-14\">\u201cMr. Martin: \u2014 I have a copy of the report.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-15\">\u201cThe Court: \u2014 There is no question about [what] it says, about what the report is. I think he is entitled to it, it is part of the file that the witness handed over to Mr. Martin, as I understand.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-18\">\u201cMr. Martin: \u2014 This is right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-19\">\u201cThe Court: \u2014 Yes, go ahead. In other words, don\u2019t be quite so helpful, Mr. McArdle. He seems to be getting along all right.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-20\">\u201cMr. McArdle: \u2014 Well, I was trying, if the Court please\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-21\">\u201cThe Court: \u2014 He is getting along all right. In other words, it is a great point to interfere in the cross-examination and break the train of thought. I do not think that is a proper thing to do. I don\u2019t think it is fair.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-22\">\u201cMr. McArdle: \u2014 I don\u2019t think it is fair of Your Honor to accuse me of this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b531-23\">\u201cThe Court: \u2014 You will notice this, that counsel will very often do that when defense counsel is trying to make a point. I call your attention to the fact they are getting along all right. Do not interrupt. When one counsel examines, I would like to have the other fellow sit down so the fellow who is doing the interrogating has the full attention of the jury. This is the practice I would like to have followed.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b531-24\">We entertain no doubt that the statements of the court did reflect unfavorably on the plaintiff\u2019s counsel\u2019s conduct to some degree. But we cannot say that the reflection was of such a serious nature as to constitute reversible error, particularly in view of the court\u2019s statement in its charge that, \u201cWe have had the benefit in this case, members of the jury, of 'having two of the most competent, experienced and able counsel of the Allegheny Bar of the Western District of Pennsylvania. We see lawyers in the Federal Court come in from all over the country and these two gentlemen are just as good as anyone. * * * \u201d We point out, however, that if plaintiff\u2019s counsel had been guilty of frivolously or unnecessarily interrupting the proceedings' \u2014 \u2022 though we do not say that had occurred here \u2014 the better course for the court to have pursued would have been to call counsel to side bar and there administer such a rebuke as it deemed necessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>The plaintiff next asserts that the court \u25a0disparaged her case by suggesting the possibility that she was malingering. 'The issue arises because of a question \u25a0asked Dr. Wycoff on cross-examination. Dr. Rowe\u2019s letter, most of the contents \u25a0of which had been read into the record without valid objection, had stated that in examining the plaintiff he \u201ccould find no atrophy of the shoulders or arms. On this occasion during the examination all movements of the neck were extremely limited to about three to five degrees. However, previously during the taking of the history the patient had shown no evidence of limitation of neck movements, no loss of motor power or any change in tendon reflexes could be found.\u201d This constituted a suggestion that the plaintiff\u2019s difficulties in moving her neck might be fictitious.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-3\">The defendants\u2019 counsel asked Dr. Wy\u25a0coff: \u201cAnd is there anything that is known to medical science which would \u2022explain an ability to move the neck freely \u25a0a moment before the physical examination, and then an inability to move more than three or five degrees at the time of the physical examination?\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">Mr. McArdle, the plaintiff\u2019s attorney, \u25a0then said, \u201cThat is objected to. That was not in the report.\u201d The court then said: \u201cWell, of course, that would assume at some time that she was malingering, .as I understand it.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\"> The plaintiff insists that the use of the term \u201cmalingering\u201d by the \u25a0court was gravely prejudicial to her case. 'To malinger is defined as \u201cacting the part of a malingerer; to feign illness, or inability.\u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> The trial judge perhaps \u25a0equated neurosis with malingering. A careful reading of the transcript indicates that he did not imply that the plaintiff actually was malingering but there was a suggestion of such a possibility. A \u25a0federal trial judge may express his views respecting the probative value of the evidence but if he does so he must make it clear to the jury that it is its sole right to determine the weight and credibility of the evidence. In his charge the trial judge made several statements of a general nature to this effect, but the word \u201cmalingering\u201d is a strong and ugly term. If it is to be employed by a trial judge, under the circumstances at bar, he should make sure that the members of the jury clearly understand their function as triers of the fact and that they are the sole judges of the credence to be given to the evidence. We are of the opinion that the trial judge should have pointed this out to the jury in respect to his use of the term \u201cmalingering\u201d and it would have been appropriate for him to have done so at the time the statement was made by him. It should be noted, however, that the plaintiff\u2019s counsel apparently did not think the incident of sufficient importance at the time of its occurrence or thereafter to request the court to give any special instruction to the jury or to ask for the withdrawal of a juror when the court used the word \u201cmalingering.\u201d In fact, the plaintiff\u2019s counsel made no objection to the use of the word. His objection was to Dr. Rowe\u2019s statement respecting the inability of the plaintiff to move her neck freely, coming into the record \u201cfrom the mouth of Dr. Wycoff.\u201d<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> We are of the view that the malingering incident cannot be deemed to be of sufficient consequence to justify a new trial. In so saying we are aware that Dr. Wycoff was an important witness for the plaintiff and we are not unmindful of what we said in Groce v. Seder, 267 F.2d 352 (1959).</p>\n<p id=\"b532-9\">In general on the subject of the proper conduct of the trial judge we lay emphasis on Myers v. George, 271 F.2d 168, 174 (8 Cir. 1959), in which the court correctly stated: \u201cIn jury trials the trial judge should be cautious and circumspect in his language and conduct before the jury. He must be fair to both sides, and the extent to which he may go in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"479\">*479</page-number>comments and remarks during the trial is governed by the fundamental principle that nothing should be said or done by him which will prejudice the rights of the parties litigant. * * * This includes remarks to counsel touching the management of the case and reflecting on their conduct, as well as those touching the character of the witnesses and the value of their testimony.\u201d Cf. Lindeman v. Textron, Inc., 229 F.2d 273, 276 (2 Cir. 1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b533-4\">We have examined all of the incidents to which the plaintiff has referred. Perhaps more might be said about some of them but we think that what we have already written is sufficient to show that the plaintiff has failed to sustain her charges of bias on the part of the trial judge. We think that the sum total of what has been stated respecting his interrogations, comments and rulings do not demonstrate that the plaintiff suffered substantial prejudice during the course of the proceedings and that a new trial should be ordered. In this connection this opinion should be read with Cromling v. Pittsburgh and Lake Erie R. R. Co., 3 Cir.,-F.2d-, filed concurrently with this opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">On its appeal, Penney contends that the jury\u2019s finding of liability was not supported by sufficient evidence. Penney points out that its liability depended on the jury finding that the plaintiff\u2019s accident was caused by her tripping over a piece of string lying on the floor. Penney contends that the evidence does not support such a finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-7\">Reviewing the record in light of this contention it is clear that neither the plaintiff nor any witness gave direct testimony as to the cause of the fall. There is testimony that a piece of wrapping cord was found at or near the spot in the aisle where the plaintiff fell. She testified that as she walked toward her daughter-in-law her right foot was caught by something and that after her fall she discovered wrapping cord on her shoe that was the same as the cord in the aisle and the cord which was traced back to the defendant\u2019s spindle.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-8\"> In determining whether sufficient evidence was presented to support the jury\u2019s finding since this is a diversity case, we must look to the law of Pennsylvania. There is enough evidence to support the inference obviously drawn by the jury, that the plaintiff became entangled with or tripped over wrapping cord or string negligently left in the aisle of the Penney store by Penney employees. See Smith v. Bell Telephone Company of Pennsylvania, supra, 397 Pa. at 138, 153 A.2d at 479. Compare Dorofey v. Bethlehem Steel Company, 407 Pa. 288, 180 A.2d 562 (1962), in which the facts are clearly distinguishable from those of the case at bar.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-9\">All the issues raised by either party have been duly considered. We have expressed our views concerning those which we think merit consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-10\">The judgment will be affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b523-17\"> The ease was five years old when tried and, for reasons that will appear in the course of this opinion, there was no pretrial conference. No better example of the desirability of the pretrial conference can be found than the case at bar. It .should be pointed out, however, that the court below, with very rare exceptions, has made a point of employing the technique of the pretrial conference, and indeed all pretrial techniques, and has by great energy and industry brought its docket up to date.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b525-8\">.
