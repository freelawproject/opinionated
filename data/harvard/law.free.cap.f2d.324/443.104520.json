Rule 31(c), Fed.R.Crim.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-24\"> While in some -circumstances, as here, the elements of unlawful entry (D.C.Code \u00a7 22-3102 (1961)) are comprehended within those of housebreaking (D.C.Code \u00a7 22-1801 (1961)), the latter requires also a finding of larcenous intent. Since the jury found the appellant guilty of larceny as well as housebreaking, it must have determined that larcenous intent was present in this case. Under these circumstances we need not pursue the issue of whether the failure to give the requested charge was error, since, even if it be so regarded, it was harmless in its impact upon the jury\u2019s disposition of the crimes charged in the indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-25\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
