Thereafter an information was lodged setting out his 1954 narcotics conviction and upon his acknowledgement of that record, Berry was sentenced to serve ten years<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> on each count, all sentences to run concurrently, with a recommendation that he be sent to Lexington, Kentucky, for treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-27\">On December 19, 1961 about one p. m., one Garrett, a Baltimore police officer was working \u201cunder cover\u201d with Federal narcotics officers investigating narcotics traffic in Washington. That day, accompanied by one Hodge, Garrett entered an area much frequented by narcotics violators and addicts. Garrett had never met the appellant, but Hodge testified that for six or eight months, or more, he had been acquainted with the appellant. Berry was waiting for a street light to change at 13th and U Streets when Garrett and Hodge walked up to him. Hodge in the jargon of the narcotics underworld asked Berry if he had narcotics for sale and received an affirmative answer. Berry asked Hodge what he wanted. When told 15 capsules, Berry brought out a chewing gum wrapper, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>counted out 15 capsules and handed them to Hodge. Hodge paid Berry $22.50, and then asked Garrett how many he wanted. Garrett answered six capsules. Berry counted out the required number, poured them into Garrett\u2019s hand, and received $9 as the price. These two episodes predicated the indictment, the first three counts involving the Hodge 15-capsule transaction, with counts four, five and six pertaining to the six capsules of heroin sold to Garrett. Both Hodge and Garrett testified and were cross-examined in complete detail as to their own status and identity and as to Berry\u2019s possession, concealment and sale of the 21 capsules. Berry did not take the stand.</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">Handicapped by the odds against him in that state of the evidence, court-appointed trial counsel sought to found a claim that the arrest warrant was insufficient.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> As a matter of tactics, he tried to becloud Garrett\u2019s identification of Berry, developing on cross-examination that Garrett had learned Berry\u2019s name from a photograph in possession of the authorities. But the prosecutor had interrupted and sought to prevent any possible reference to the photograph. In a bench conference, the trial judge cautioned counsel not to pursue his line of questioning as it might turn out to be harmful. But counsel believed, he said, that he could \u201ctie it in with one of the theories of the defense we have.\u201d Surely he is not now in position to complain when the witness finally answered that at the Bureau of Narcotics he \u201cwas shown a picture of Mr. Berry.\u201d <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The answer was definitely germane to the very questions defense counsel was pressing. To inject an additional element of the doubt which counsel was seeking to raise, he brought out \u2014 and argued to the jury \u2014 that Berry on some unidentified charge had been in jail from March 3, 1961, to December 12, 1961. Thus Hodge could not have seen Berry a matter of some two weeks before December 19, 1961, as Hodge had testified. The defense asked the jury not to believe that \u201cwithin seven days after this naan was released from custody, he was back selling narcotics.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-10\">In arguing a motion for acquittal, defense trial counsel referred to a conflict in the testimony. \u201cThe Court: That is a matter for the jury to decide on any conflicts.\u201d Counsel: \u201cWhat I am saying is, it appears to me that an instruction on entrapment \u2014 .\u201d The judge ruled at once that there was \u201cno evidence of entrapment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b462-12\">We are urged now to reverse on the authority of Johnson v. United States, 115 U.S.App.D.C. 63, 317 F.2d 127 (1963). The facts here are not remotely similar. Hodge and Garrett walked up to Berry and asked if he had narcotics for sale. He did. He was in business. He had at least 21 capsules in his possession, concealed in a gum package wrapper. He made two sales directly to the two purchasers in the presence of each other.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b462-13\">\u201cThe conduct with which the defense of entrapment is concerned is the <em>manufacturing </em>of crime by law enforcement officials and their agents. Such conduct, of course, is far different from the permissible stratagems involved in the detection and prevention of crime. Thus before the issue of entrapment can fairly be said to have been presented in a criminal prosecution there must have been at least some showing of the kind of conduct by Government agents which may well have induced the accused to commit the crime charged.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> (Emphasis in original.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"409\">*409</page-number>The trial judge ruled correctly. It is difficult to conjure up more complete \u25a0evidence of two open and direct sales than we have here. Berry clearly was not entrapped into carrying a supply of heroin concealed in a chewing gum package, from which he dispensed 15 capsules for $22.50 and six capsules for $9, in \u201cready compliance\u201d <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> with what looked to hum like a good opportunity to do some of the very business he was equipped and so ready to transact.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">We find no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b461-21\">. As a second offender, Berry could have received a sentence of not less than ten nor more than forty years on each of four of the counts, and not less than five nor more than twenty years on each of <em>the </em>other two counts.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b462-5\">.

Mr. Justice Roberts, concurring in Sorrells v. United States, 287 U.S. 435, 459, 53 S.Ct. 210, 219, 77 L.Ed. 413 (1932), stated the principle as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-9\">\u201cThe applicable principle is that courts must be closed to the trial of a crime instigated by the government\u2019s own agents. No other issue, no comparison of equities as between the guilty official and the guilty defendant, has any place in the enforcement of this overruling principle of public policy.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-10\">At page 457 in the same opinion, 53 S.Ct. at page 218, Mr. Justice Roberts expanded on this principle:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-11\">\u201c * * * The protection of its own functions and the preservation of the purity of its own temple belongs only to the court. It is the province of the court and of the court alone to protect itself and the government from such prostitution of the criminal law. The violation of the principles of justice by the entrapment of the unwary into crime should be dealt with by the court no matter by whom or at what stage of the proceedings the facts are brought to its attention. * * \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-18\">Similarly, Mr. Justice Frankfurter has expressed concern over the Government\u2019s creation of crime:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b463-19\">\u201c * * * Furthermore, a test that looks to the character and predisposition of the defendant rather than the conduct of the police loses sight of the underlying reason for the defense of entrapment. No matter what the defendant\u2019s past record and present inclinations to criminality, or the depths to which he has sunk in the estimation of society, certain police conduct to ensnare him into further crime is not to be tolerated by an advanced society. * * * \u201d Sherman v. United States, 356 U.S. 369, 382-383, 78 S.Ct. 819, 826, 2 L.Ed.2d 848 (1958).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b463-22\">Irrespective of these and other expressed misgivings as to the Government\u2019s participation in crime, it is still the law that presenting a predisposed suspect, who is ready, willing and able to commit crime, the opportunity to do so is not entrapment. See Hansford v. United States, 112 U.S.App.D.C. 359, 362, 303 F.2d 219, 222 (1962), and cases there cited. The issue presented by this appeal, however, is not entrapment as a matter of law, but entrapment as an issue for the jury. Did the prosecution prove to the jury\u2019s satisfaction beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was ready, willing, and able to sell the drugs and that the Government merely presented him the opportunity to violate the law? The defendant requested an instruction on entrapment to assist the jury in deciding this issue and it was refused, the trial court ruling, \u201cThere is no evidence of entrapment in this case. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>No evidence at all to warrant a charge on entrapment.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b464-4\">In so ruling, the trial court was obviously in error.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The Government\u2019s evidence shows that the purchases from the defendant were made by a Government agent, using a drug addict as an intermediary, and by the intermediary himself, both purchases being made with Government money. The evidence further shows that the agent and the informant sought out the defendant and asked for the drugs, the drug addict informant assuring the defendant that the Government agent \u201cwas O.K.\u201d Incidentally, the Government\u2019s evidence also shows that the informant was paid by the Government for his work and that a possession of narcotics charge previously filed against him was dismissed.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-15\">Under these circumstances, it cam hardly be said there was no \u201cshowing of the kind of conduct by Government-agents which may well have induced the' accused to commit the crime charged.\u201d' Lopez v. United States, 373 U.S. 427, 434-435, 83 S.Ct. 1381, 1385-1386, 10-L.Ed.2d 462 (1963). Without doubt, by offering to buy, the Government induced the defendant to sell. \u201cAs pointed out by Mr. Justice Frankfurter in his Sherman concurrence, the <em>particular </em>sale to an officer or police agent is <em>always </em>one induced by the purchaser.\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The question, to be answered by the jury, then is: would he have sold to anyone he considered safe?<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Thus a jury issue on entrapment was raised and a charge on entrapment should have been given as to the sale counts in the indictment. Johnson v. United States, supra, Note 3.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b464-5\">. The possession counts and the sale counts must be distinguished. As to possession, it is of coui'se true that there can be no entrapment if an accused had the narcotics in his actual custody at the very moment he was first approached by Government agents. If he should leave them after that first approach, however, to go and fetch the narcotics, then the issue of entrapment would be raised as to possession also.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b464-6\">.
