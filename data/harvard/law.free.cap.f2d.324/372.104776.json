The Court has read the record and has carefully considered the briefs filed and the oral argument. We find that there is no merit to the appellant\u2019s contentions. Contrary to the appellant\u2019s contentions, we hold as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b427-13\">(1) The indictment was sufficient; the grand jury asserted knowledge of .substantial assets in the possession of the bankrupt. United States v. DeBrow, 1953, 346 U.S. 374, 74 S.Ct. 113, 98 L.Ed. 92; Kelly v. United States, 5 Cir., 1931, 47 F.2d 122.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-14\">(2) The evidence was sufficient to show that the defendant signed the bankruptcy schedules under oath, an essential element \u2022of the offense.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-15\">(3) The trial judge did not err in his rulings on the admissibility of the evi\u2022dence introduced by the Government.</p>\n<p id=\"b427-16\">The judgment must be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
