The parents have never been married to each other. The mother as next friend filed in the Domestic Relations Branch of the Municipal Court of the District of Columbia (now the Court of General Sessions) a suit against the father for maintenance of the appellee children. In his answer under oath the father admitted jurisdiction of the Branch over the suit, admitted his paternity, and expressed willingness to maintain the children to the extent of his ability. An order, consented to by both parties, was thereupon entered, requiring the father to pay a stated sum per week, for the support of the children.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-18\">Some sixteen months later, the mother as next friend of the children moved that the appellant father be adjudged in contempt for failure to make payments for their support as ordered. Appellant\u2019s answer to the motion asserted for the first time that the Domestic Relations Branch had no jurisdiction over the suit for maintenance and that the orders against him were accordingly void.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-19\">On February 12, 1962, the Domestic Relations Branch found that the appellant father was $315 in arrears in support payments as of November 11, 1961, adjudged him in contempt, and ordered him committed to jail for thirty days. It stayed execution of his commitment on condition that he make current payments and pay at least $20 per month on the arrears since November 11, 1961.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"886\">*886</page-number>Upon appeal the Municipal Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia (now the District of Columbia Court of Appeals), one judge dissenting, held that the lower court had jurisdiction over the suit and affirmed its finding that the appellant was in contempt for failure to make support payments under its orders. It held, however, that the lower court lacked the power to sentence appellant to imprisonment for his contempt. See 183 A.2d 916 (Mun.Ct.App.1962).</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">The father petitioned for leave to appeal, and we granted the petition. His essential argument is that under Section 11-907(1) (c) of the D.C.Code (1961), the Juvenile Court of the District of Columbia had exclusive jurisdiction of proceedings to obtain support for illegitimate children, and that Section 11-762 of the Code, giving the Domestic Relations Branch exclusive jurisdiction over \u201ccivil actions to enforce support of minor children,\u201d applies only to legitimate children.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-6\">Over the years the trend of the law of the District of Columbia has been to offer an increasing degree of protection to illegitimate children, at least in matters of support. Originally, by virtue of reception by the District of the Maryland bastardy statute, the putative father, when paternity had been established, could be required to indemnify the government for moneys expended by it on account of the illegitimate child, as was noted in Moss v. United States, 29 App. D.C. 188 at 191 (1907). At the time of the Moss decision, however, as the court indicated, there was no longer any way whereby the father of an illegitimate child could be required to contribute toward the child\u2019s support.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> *In 1912, Congress passed \u201cAn Act To provide for the support and maintenance of bastards in the District of Columbia.\u201d Act of June 18, 1912, 37 Stat. 134. This Act provided a procedure whereby an unmarried mother could proceed against the putative father in the Juvenile Court to obtain support for the child once paternity was proved or acknowledged.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b940-11\">In 1938, Congress enacted comprehensive legislation defining the nature and functions of the Juvenile Court. Act of June 1, 1938, 52-Stat. 596. This legislation brought together and modernized the earlier enactments concerning that court, and redefined its jurisdiction. Included was the following provision which, with minor amendments not here relevant, is still in force today as D.C.Code \u00a7 11-907 (1) (c) (1961), and is relied on by the appellant here:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b940-12\">\u201cSec. 6. Jurisdiction. \u2014 1. Children. \u2014 Except as herein otherwise provided, the court shall have original and exclusive jurisdiction of all cases and in proceedings: ******</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b940-13\">\u201c(c) <em>To determine the paternity </em>of any child alleged to have been born out of wedlock and to provide for his support in accordance with the provisions of an Act providing for the support and maintenance of children born out of wedlock, approved June 18, 1912 * * Juvenile Court Act of the District of Columbia \u00a7 6(1) (c), 52 Stat. 597 (1938). (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b940-14\">Some years after' the 1938 legislation, prompted by the bar of the District of Columbia, Congress again reexamined the Juvenile Court legislation concerning the support of illegitimates. There resulted a substantial revision and modernization of the 1912 and 1938 Acts. Act of January 11, 1951, 64 Stat. 1240, D.C.Code \u00a7\u00a7 11-951 through 11-967 (1961). While <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>this Act contained some new provisions that will be considered at a later point in this opinion, it did not alter the basic and exclusive remedies provided through the Juvenile Court \u2014 remedies which were, as we shall see, quasi-criminal rath&gt;er than civil in nature.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-4\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">In 1956 Congress created the Domestic Relations Branch of the Municipal 'Court, see \u00a7\u00a7 11-758 through 11-770 of the D.C.Code (1961), and defined its jurisdiction in Section 11-762, in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b941-6\">\u201cThe Domestic Relations Branch and each judge sitting therein shall have exclusive jurisdiction over all actions for divorce from the bond of \u25a0marriage and legal separation from (bed and board, including proceedings \u25a0incidental to such actions for alimony, pendente lite and permanent, and for support and custody of minor children; applications for revocation of divorce from bed and .board; <em>civil actions to enforce support of minor children; </em>civil actions to enforce support of wife; actions \u2022seeking custody of minor children; * * (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b941-8\">Section 11-762 was part of the \u25a0legislation transferring jurisdiction over domestic relations cases generally in the District of Columbia from the United States District Court to the newly-created Domestic Relations Branch. Under Section 16-415 of the Code, the jurisdiction of the District Court in support cases had been limited to suits against a husband to enforce maintenance of his wife and minor children.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> This statute plainly referred only to legitimate children, that is, those of a husband and wife. Cf. Howard v. Howard, 72 App.D.C. 145, 112 F.2d 44 (1940); Schneider v. Schneider, supra note 2.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> But in Section 11-762, the jurisdiction of the Domestic Relations Branch in respect of support for minor children is expressed in much broader terms. One clause of this section gives the Branch jurisdiction over <em>\u201ccivil actions to enforce support of minor children,\u201d </em>unlimited by any reference to husband and/or wife. A separate clause gives jurisdiction over \u201ccivil actions to enforce support of wife\u201d (not \u201cwife and minor children\u201d). On the face of the statute, the word \u201cchildren\u201d can fairly be construed to include all children, legitimate and illegitimate. The statute does not qualify, limit, or define the word \u201cchildren\u201d, and appellant has made no showing that Congress intended the word to be limited. See United States v. Philippine National Bank, 110 U.S.App.D.C. 250, 292 F.2d 743 (1961).</p>\n<p id=\"b942-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"888\">*888</page-number>We believe, in the absence of anything in the legislative materials to support a view that jurisdiction was to remain precisely the same,<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> that this change in the form and wording of the new jurisdictional statute was deliberate and was intended to accomplish what its language indicates \u2014 to confer jurisdiction over civil actions to enforce support of minor children, without any requirement that they must be children of a wife or former wife of their acknowledged father. This view is in harmony with our previous decisions, which have uniformly construed the grant of jurisdiction in suits for support under Section 11-762 as having a broad rather than a limited scope. See Thomason v. Thomason, 107 U.S.App.D.C. 27, 274 F.2d 89 (1959); David v. Blumenthal, 110 U.S.App.D.C. 272, 292 F.2d 765 (1961); and cf. Harris v. Harris, 106 U.S.App.D.C. 282, 272 F.2d 511 (1959) ; and Wagner v. Wagner, 110 U.S.App.D.C. 345, 293 F.2d 533 (1961).<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">Appellant asserts, however, that jurisdiction over this civil action to enforce support was exclusively m the Juvenile Court. As we have seen, under Section 11-907 of the D.C.Code, enacted in 1938, the Juvenile Court is given \u201coriginal and exclusive jurisdiction * * * <em>To determine the paternity </em>of any child alleged to have been born out of wedlock and to provide for his support\u201d in accordance with the provisions of Sections 1,1-951 through 11-967. (Emphasis supplied.) Paternity proceedings under these sections are in some aspects quasi-criminal in nature.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> They are brought by the filing of an information in the name of the District of Columbia and are prosecuted by the Corporation Counsel (Section 11-951). Such proceedings to establish paternity and to provide for the support of the illegitimate child must be instituted within prescribed time limits: after four months of pregnancy, within two years after the birth of the child, or within one year after the putative father has ceased contributing to the child\u2019s support (Section 11 \u2014 952).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In such proceedings the putative father may of course acknowledge paternity (Sections 11-958, 11-960). In the event of failure of the defendant father to comply with any or<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"889\">*889</page-number>der for support which it may enter, the Juvenile Court may imprison the defendant for contempt or treat his failure as a misdemeanor (Sections 11-959, 11-961). But there is no provision in any statute that the mother must elect this quasi-criminal remedy, instead of proceeding by civil action in the Domestic Relations Branch, when paternity is not in dispute. If paternity were disputed it may well be that the Domestic Relations Branch would dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, in view of the provision giving the Juvenile Court \u201cexclusive jurisdiction * * * [i]o <em>determine the :paternity </em>* * * and to provide for his support\u201d in Section 11-907. (Emphasis supplied.) But we think a support proceeding in which paternity is not in issue, brought in the Domestic Relations Branch in accord with the jurisdiction expressly given the Branch by Section 11-762, does not in any way \u201caffect or diminish the jurisdiction of the Juvenile Court.\u201d<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> The grant to the Branch, in that Section, of \u201cjurisdiction over * * '* civil actions to enforce support of minor children,\u201d could not be more explicit. The grant should not be defeated by a mere obscure implication, if any, in a different section of the Code.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-7\">An independent basis for our conclusion that the Domestic Relations Branch had jurisdiction of this complaint may perhaps be found in the provisions of the Uniform Support Law, enacted on July 10, 1957. See Sections 11-1601 through 11-1624 of the D.C.Code (1961). Section 11-1606 gives the Domestic Relations Branch jurisdiction of proceedings to enforce duties of support brought under the Support Law. In enacting this provision, Congress clearly intended that the duty of a father to support his illegitimate children<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> should, under some circumstances at least, be enforceable in the Domestic Relations Branch. Whether the present suit can properly be considered as one brought pursuant to the Support Law is a matter we need not decide, as we think the jurisdiction of the Branch is in any event clear.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-10\">Our decision today holds that in cases where the natural father acknowledges paternity illegitimate children are entitled to the civil remedies for support available in the Domestic Relations Branch of the Court of General Sessions. They also retain, of course, all the remedies presently available to them in the Juvenile Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-11\">We affirm the decision of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals insofar as it holds that the Domestic Relations Branch had jurisdiction over the suit and that appellant was in contempt for failure to comply with its orders. The question of the Branch\u2019s power to commit appellant for his contempt is not before us on appeal and we express no opinion as to it.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-12\">So ordered.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b940-7\">. The court added:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Agzg\">\u201cWe fully agreed that the juvenile court should have power upon conviction to compel the father of an illegitimate child to maintain his child. Unhappily, the old bastardy act is no longer in force, the Code failed to revive it, and until Congress gives such power to the judge of the juvenile court, this court cannot affirm such a judgment as this.\u201d Moss v. United States, supra, 29 App.D.C. at 195.</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b940-16\">. See H.R.Rep. No. 105, 62d Cong., 1st Sess. (1911); S.Rep.

Hopson, 95 U.S.App.D.C. 285, 221 F.2d 839 (1955), and could enter a maintenance order in favor of a child against his father after a collusive Nevada divorce, see Schneider v.

Ct.App.1943), discussed in the briefs filed with us, seems irrelevant here. That decision, which related to the enforcement of an agreement to provide support to an illegitimate child, was rendered long before the Domestic Relations Branch was created and before Section 11 \u2014 762 was enacted. At that time, as has already been shown, the District Court had jurisdiction to give support for minor children only if they were the children of a husband and wife.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b942-5\">.

It may be noted, however, that the Juvenile Court Act defines \u201cchild\u201d as \u201ca person under the age of 18 j'ears,\u201d thus including illegitimates as well as legitimates therein, for purposes of that Act.

Code \u00a7 11-762 (1961) as the predicate for their conclusion that jurisdiction was well founded.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">My colleagues here say that the unmarried mother may secure a hollow judgment <footnotemark>4</footnotemark> for the support of her illegitimate children since Public Law 486 <footnotemark>5</footnotemark> creating the Domestic Relations Branch had accorded to it jurisdiction over \u201ccivil actions to enforce support of minor children.\u201d \u2022 In Thomason v. Thomason, 107 U.S.App.D.C. 27, 274 F.2d 89 (1959), we defined \u201ccivil actions\u201d to include a counterclaim based upon an agreement for support entered into between an erstwhile married couple. As to such actions Public Law 486 conferred upon the Branch the power previously exercised by the District Court, we said. And see David v. Blumenthal, 110 U.S.App.D.C. 272, 292 F.2d 765 (1961), where we discussed the power which had been \u201ctransferred\u201d from the District Court to the Branch. The District Court never exercised jurisdiction over a <em>civil </em>action to secure to an unwed mother, support for her illegitimate children. Surely no such power was transferred if it never existed in the District Court. So my colleagues conclude, in effect, such power was created and vested in the Branch, yet they point to not a single word in the hearings or elsewhere to demonstrate that thereafter the Branch was to exercise a jurisdiction which had been vested in the Juvenile Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-13\">The grant of such jurisdiction, my colleagues say, \u201cshould not be defeated by a mere obscure implication, if any, in a different section of the Code.\u201d I see no-\u201cimplication\u201d and no obscurity in section 113 of Public Law 486. It is not in some unrelated \u201csection of the Code.\u201d Section 113 was part of the very same Act. It explicitly provided:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b944-14\">\u201cNothing contained in this Act. shall be construed so as to affect or diminish the jurisdiction of the Juvenile Court of the District of Columbia, or any judge presiding therein.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b944-15\">The Juvenile Court had been functioning for half a century. It has investigators and staff officers in position to assist it in carrying out the powers entrusted to it. The Branch has no such facilities. Congress, our local judges and', community leaders concerned with the-problem were fully alive, not only to the-questions inherent in these situations but to the policy1<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> sought to be implemented-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>As late as January 11, 1951, Congress had passed \u201cAn Act Relating to Children Born Out of Wedlock.\u201d <footnotemark>7</footnotemark> First, the Act specifically repealed 37 Stat. 134, 41 Stat. 1144 and 44 Stat. 208. Next, the legislation provided that the \u201cjuvenile court of the District of Columbia is hereby given jurisdiction of all cases arising under this Act.\u201d Just as the Branch in Public 486 had been given \u201cexclusive jurisdiction\u201d over civil actions involving agreements with reference to the support of children of married couples, whether later divorced or not, so the Juvenile Court was given \u201cjurisdiction of all cases\u201d arising under the 1951 Act. Thus in section 12 <footnotemark>8</footnotemark> the 1951 Act dealt with \u201cVoluntary Acknowledgement of Paternity By Father.\u201d The section outlined the basis upon which the <em>Juvenile Court </em>might give effect to an agreement by a putative father to support a child born out of wedlock. It had long since been held that if a putative father had entered into a <em>valid contract </em>to support an illegitimate child, an action for its breach would lie. Williams v. Amann, 33 A.2d 633 (Mun.Ct.App.D.C.1943). 'The court there held that such an action was to be grounded, not on statutes relating to bastardy proceedings, but on \u2022the breach of the promise to support.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-4\">Moreover, the 1951 Act reaffirmed the Juvenile Court\u2019s concurrent jurisdiction with the United States District Court for the District of Columbia as to all cases .arising under the misdemeanor section, D.C.Code \u00a7 22-903 (1961). But it did more. The 1951 Act enlarged the definition of the nonsupport misdemeanor previously outlined in section 22-903 so that it would \u201capply to any person who * * * fails to support his illegitimate child when paternity has been established judicially or when paternity has been directly acknowledged by the putative father under oath, or indirectly acknowledged by voluntarily making contributions to the support of such child.\u201d To cap it all \u2014 to execute District policy to secure support for the illegitimate child and relieve the District from the burden of maintenance \u2014 to put the entire problem in the hands of a court which for fifty years has been dealing with it and which handles more than 1,000 paternity cases every year \u2014 Congress said: \u201c\u00a7 11-907.

That is why Congress in Public 486 provided that nothing contained in that Act shall be <em>construed </em>so as to affect or diminish the jurisdiction of the Juvenile Court. I think my colleagues have misconstrued the legislation.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-12\">I think the Branch had no authority to enter the order which the Municipal Court of Appeals affirmed, and which my colleagues now would ratify. I would reverse to the end that a proceeding be instituted in the Juvenile Court of the District of Columbia against Johnson pursuant to the provisions of D.C.Code \u00a7 11-961 (a) and (b), for if he is in violation, that misdemeanor is continuous and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"892\">*892</page-number>will predicate a present prosecution\u2014 with some chance of affording affirmative relief.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> And after all, is that not what the children require \u2014 and the policy the District seeks to effectuate ?</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b943-20\">.

Quoted in full in the majority opinion, note 3, from which we excerpt only the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b944-7\">\u201cWhenever any <em>7msiand </em>shall fail or refuse to maintain <em>his wife </em>and <em>minor children * </em>* * the court, on application of the <em>wife * * </em>* may decree that he shall pay her, periodically, such sums * * * \u201d etc. (Emphasis supplied.)</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b944-10\">. The Municipal Court of Appeals held that the challenged support order may not be enforced by imprisonment, a conclusion which the majority does not reach. I deem it strange that Congress could be said to have intended that a vain and: empty result be reached when it had already provided means by which to provide monetary relief.

In 1912 Congress enacted 37 Stat. 134 to-\u201cprovide for the support and maintenance of bastards in the District of Columbia.\u201d H.R.Rep.No.105, 62d Cong., 1st Sess. (1911) stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b944-19\">\u201cIt is believed that the District of Columbia is the only place in the Union where the father is not liable for the support of his illegitimate child. It is estimated that over 50 per cent of the dependent children cared for at the expense of the public appropriation for the District of Columbia are illegitimate. The <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"891\">*891</page-number>community should be relieved of this burden at the earliest date, and the putative fathers should be made to meet the charges of suppor-t and education of their illegitimate children.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AYi\">The report cited Moss v.

Aside from whatever might happen in a \u00a7 11-961 (a) and (b) proceeding, instead of a mere money judgment which the Branch has no power to enforce as pointed out by Chief Judge Hood in his dissent, I suspect that at the very least appellant would seek to negotiate an agreement to bring himself within the provisions of D.C.Code \u00a7 11-960. Otherwise, possible imprisonment in the workhouse for no more than twelve months, coupled with a fine, would not seem to afford Johnson a propitious prospect.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
