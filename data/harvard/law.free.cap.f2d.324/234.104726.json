The motion was based on Rule 60(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. It is conceded tha't the determination of such a motion will not be upset on appeal unless there has been a clear abuse of discretion. Parker v. Broadcast Music, Inc., 2 Cir., 289 F.2d 318. See also Link v. Wabash Railroad Company, 370 U.S. 626, 82 S.Ct. 1386, 8 L.Ed.2d 734. We see no abuse of discretion here. This is made clear by the following quotation from Judge Ryan\u2019s memorandum opinion:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AlEm\">\u201cThis suit was filed on September 21, 1960 for injuries alleged to have been sustained \u00bfboard the SS Eliza- \u2018 beth Schulte on-' February 24, 1960. This is but one of five separate pending suits filed by plaintiff, asserting five separate claims for personal injuries dating back- to December 11J 1957. At a call of the Review Calendar on June 12,1962 a four-month order was entered. This order was not complied with and on October 25, 1962 a dismissal order was entered. Plaintiff now moves to vacate this dismissal and restore the suit to the docket.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b289-15\">\u201cPlaintiff has done nothing apparently since the filing of answers to interrogatories on October 26, 1961 to prosecute this suit. Plaintiff has not presented any facts which constitute \u2018excusable neglect\u2019 as contemplated by Rule 60(b) F.R.C.P. and has waited over eight months before bringing this motion: (Ohlinger v. United States, 308 F.2d 667 (2d Cir., 1962).)\u201d</blockquote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
