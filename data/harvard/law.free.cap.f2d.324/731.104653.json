The sole ground of attack is that Georgia, not the United States, alone had power to prohibit or convict for this action. As the offense was committed on lands purchased by the United States by the consent of the legislature of the State of Georgia, and the United States Penitentiary in Fulton County, Georgia, is a \u201cneedful building\u201d within the meaning of U.S.Const, art. I, \u00a7 8, el. 17, the United States has legislative jurisdiction over those lands, United States v. Unzeuta, 1930, 281 U.S. 138, 50 S.Ct. 284, 74 L.Ed. 761; Battle v. United States, 1908, 209 U.S. 36, 28 S.Ct. 422, 52 L.Ed. 670. Consequently the District Judge did not err in denying Appellant\u2019s motion to vacate sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b786-13\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
