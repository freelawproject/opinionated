While the Government can point to no evidence expressly stating that there were no stamps affixed to the whiskey, it contends that there was sufficient circumstantial evidence to warrant the jury's inferring that no stamps had been affixed. The most persuasive is that the purchases were made for $5.50 a gallon, whereas the stamps themselves would have cost $10.50 a gallon.</p>\n<p id=\"b81-25\">We think it is not necessary to determine whether there was sufficient evidence to warrant the jury\u2019s finding of a verdict of guilty as to these two counts, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"28\">*28</page-number>because we conclude that there is unquestionably ample evidence to support the jury\u2019s verdict of guilt as to the fourth count. Since the sentence of 18 months falls within the maximum permissible for a single count, the sentence will not be disturbed even though there might be error in connection with one or more counts.
