In a joint trial the court denied appellant\u2019s motion for acquittal at the close of the Government\u2019s case.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Thereafter the co-defendant, testifying on his own behalf, related facts tending to prove his own innocence and appellant\u2019s guilt. Appellant then called two witnesses \u2014 his wife, who provided an alibi, and his mother, who sought to impeach the co-defendant. The jury found both defendants guilty, and appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for sixteen months to four years. His application for leave to appeal <em>in forma pauperis </em>was \u201cdenied as frivolous\u201d by the District Court. Appellant\u2019s subsequent <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"895\">*895</page-number>application to this court was granted over the opposition of the United States Attorney. See Coppedge v. United States, 369 U.S. 438, 82 S.Ct. 917, 8 L.Ed.2d 21 (1962)<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b949-4\">In this appeal appellant contends that the Government\u2019s case-in-chief was insufficient to sustain a verdict of guilty and that therefore the trial court erred in denying his motion for judgment of acquittal. We agree. The Government\u2019s witnesses testified that a car was reported missing from a dealer\u2019s service garage on June 13, 1962, that the co-defendant was arrested while driving the vehicle that night, that one of several fingerprints found on the outside of the left ventilation window was appellant\u2019s, that appellant after his arrest denied any knowledge of the automobile, and that he claimed not to have seen co-defendant since before the date of the alleged unauthorized use. Based upon that evidence alone, the jury could not have found beyond a reasonable doubt that appellant was guilty.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"AH2\">The Government, however, contends that we are required to consider all the evidence, and not the Government\u2019s alone, in determining whether a judgment of acquittal is now required. It says that a defendant is ordinarily deemed to have waived his motion for acquittal at the close of the Government\u2019s evidence when, after denial of the motion, he chooses to introduce evidence on his own behalf.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We think, however, that it would be an unwarranted extension of this waiver doctrine to apply it in the circumstances of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-15\">One of the greatest safeguards for the individual under our system of criminal justice is the requirement that the prosecution must establish a prima facie case by its own evidence before the defendant may be put to his defense.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b949-16\">\u201cOurs is the accusatorial as opposed to the inquisitorial system. * * , * Under our system society carries the burden of proving its charge against the accused not out of his own mouth. It must establish its case, not by interrogation of the accused even under judicial safeguards, but by evidence independently secured through skillful investigation.\u201d [Watts v. Indiana, 338 U.S. 49, 54, 69 S.Ct. 1347, 1350, 93 L.Ed. 1801 (1949) (Frankfurter, J.)] <footnotemark>5</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b949-18\">Accordingly Rule 29(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provides that a motion for judgment of acquittal must be granted \u201cafter the evidence on either side is closed if the evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction.\u201d Denial of such a motion at the close of the Government\u2019s evidence is not immediately reviewable.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Nevertheless, if the defendant then rests or if he introduces evidence which adds nothing to the Government\u2019s evidence, the sufficiency of the Government\u2019s case-in-chief may be reviewed on the appeal from a conviction.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b950-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"896\">*896</page-number>Difficulty arises where the defendant himself introduces evidence which has the incidental effect of filling the gap in the Government\u2019s case. If the appellate court must limit its review to the evidence at the close of the Government\u2019s case, it will be required to direct an acquittal even though there is sufficient competent evidence at the close of the entire case to sustain a conviction. The waiver doctrine prevents acquittals in such cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">The few decisions which elaborate on the waiver rule attempt to justify it on the ground that the defendant\u2019s loophole-plugging evidence renders harmless any error in the denial of the original motion,<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> or that a defendant who voluntarily introduces evidence is estopped from denial of its efficacy.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> These arguments do not meet the objection that the defendant\u2019s willingness to ask for acquittal on the Government\u2019s evidence is not a willingness to gamble on a prediction that the jury or appellate court will find that evidence insufficient.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Moreover, there is danger that under the waiver rule prosecutions may be pursued with inadequate evidence in the hope that defendants will supply missing evidence. The rule seriously limits the right of the accused to have the prosecution prove a prima facie case before he is put to his defense.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b950-18\">A New Jersey court in 1916 rejected the waiver rule in criminal cases on the ground that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b950-19\">\u201cthe application of the civil rule to criminal trials is open to the criticism that, by force of a ruling that was wrong when made, testimony that the defendant ought not to have been required to give at all may be laid hold of to sustain the wrongful ruling by which he was required to give it. This comes perilously near compelling the accused to convict himself * * * <em>\u201d?</em><footnotemark><em>12</em></footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b950-20\">Nevertheless, most jurisdictions, including Federal circuits, have consistently followed the waiver rule;<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> and the Supreme Court, in a case from the Ninth Circuit, has provided at least a dictum supporting it.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark> But as the quotation suggests, the rule was imported from civil into criminal trials<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> without consider<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"897\">*897</page-number>ing the demands of our accusatorial system of criminal justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-5\">In Federal criminal cases, still another point must be considered. As Dean Wigmore pointed out:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-6\">\u201cWhere an opponent, at the close of proponent\u2019s case in chief, has made a motion asking in effect for the direction of a verdict, * * * the opponent cannot claim a ruling by the judge, as a matter of right * * * <em>without then resting his own case. </em>At that point, he is only invoking the Court\u2019s discretion; not until the entire evidence is closed may he demand a ruling <em>as of right </em>* *</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b951-8\">Thus, said Wigmore, if the opponent proceeds with his evidence, thereby confirming the discretionary nature of the original ruling, he loses any opportunity to protest the original error:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b951-9\">\u201cThis is sometimes put upon the ground of <em>waiver; </em>but it is rather a necessary consequence of the discretionary nature and limited scope of the first ruling.\u201d [9 Wigmore, Evidence \u00a7 2496 (3d ed. 1940) ] <footnotemark>16</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"A6C\">But Rule 29(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure makes it clear that the first ruling is not discretionary in criminal cases. A judgment of acquittal is mandatory if the Government\u2019s case is insufficient. The trial judge has no discretion to reserve his ruling in the expectation that the defendant will testify.<footnotemark>17</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b951-16\"> Nevertheless, we need not here question the entire waiver doctrine in criminal cases. We need only question its application based upon the defendant\u2019s response to damaging testimony of a co-defendant testifying on his own behalf. It is clear that if the defendant himself rests on the Government\u2019s evidence, the co-defendant\u2019s testimony does not waive the defendant\u2019s motion.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> It is also clear that the defendant\u2019s own evidence, introduced in response to the co-defendant\u2019s testimony, does not waive the motion if it adds nothing to the Government\u2019s case. The waiver question arises only where, as here, the defendant himself, in seeking to explain, impeach, or rebut the co-defendant\u2019s testimony, introduces evidence which overshoots that mark and tends to cure a deficiency in the Government\u2019s case.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> We think the waiver doctrine cannot fairly be applied in this situation.</p>\n<p id=\"b951-17\">A defendant\u2019s attempt to explain, impeach, or rebut a co-defendant\u2019s testimony does not at all imply that after the defendant made his motion to dismiss, he then re-evaluated the Government\u2019s casein-chief and now thinks it sufficient. It may be both necessary and possible for the defendant to meet the co-defendant\u2019s testimony. He should be free to do so without risk that he may be held to have waived his motion.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b951-18\">If the appellant is now deemed to have waived his right to test the sufficiency of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"898\">*898</page-number>the Government\u2019s case, the Government will in effect have been able to use the coercive power of the co-defendant\u2019s testimony as part of its case-in-chief, even though the Government was prohibited from calling the co-defendant to testify for the prosecution. Although this prohibition arises from the co-defendant\u2019s privilege against self-incrimination,<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> its effect excludes from the Government\u2019s case-in-chief the testimony of one who has an incentive to exculpate himself by inculpating his fellow defendant.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b952-4\">Reversed and remanded with directions to vacate the judgment and enter a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b948-12\">. We think that denial was implicit in this statement by the court: \u201cI am going to submit it to the jury. In the meanwhile, I will go into it more thoroughly, the motion to set aside the verdict as to Cephus if they find him guilty. I don\u2019t want Cephus to be misled by what I am saying here. I am not saying I -will grant it. I will bear it, and bear arguments on it. You may convince me that you are right. I am teetering on it. I am not satisfied. So I will submit it to the jury and we will see what happens.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"Ace\">. We note that after appellant had been in custody 1 <em>y2 </em>months before trial and 11 months after trial \u2014 a total of over 12 months \u2014 he was released pending appeal on his own recognizance.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b949-9\">.

Instead of granting the motion, the trial judge made no ruling. Under Rule 29, he was required to rule.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> ******And in view of the insufficiency of the evidence then in the record, the motion should have been granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b952-20\">The fact that exculpatory evidence offered by his co-defendant implicated appellant in the crime cannot deprive appellant of his rights under Rule 29(a). Nor can appellant's efforts, in introducing evidence in his own behalf to offset his co-defendant\u2019s evidence, trigger the invocation of the waiver doctrine. Whatever continued validity that archaic doctrine may have, it certainly has no application to the facts of this case. Indeed, a simple reading of Rule 29(a) indicates that the waiver doctrine is without validity in any ease.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> A defendant cannot be boxed out of his Rule 29(a) rights by forcing him to go to trial with a co-defendant, or by waiting hopefully for him to convict himself.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b952-11\">. The requirement is clear. The motion for judgment of acquittal may. be made \u201cafter the evidence on <em>either </em>side is closed.\u201d Rule 29(a). (Emphasis supplied.) But it is only as to the motion \u201cmade at the close of <em>all the evidence\u201d </em>that \u201cthe court may reserve decision.\u201d Rule 29(b). (Emphasis supplied.) Thus, the court has no authority to reserve decision as to the motion made at the close of the Government\u2019s case. Jackson v. United States, 5 Cir., 250 F.2d 897 (1958). This facet of Rule 29 is in harmony with its basic command that when the Government has not made out its case, the defendant shall be acquitted without being required to put on his proof. And it is the inconsistency of the waiver doctrine with this command of the Rule that saps the authority it derives fi-om long years of habitude.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b952-22\">. The grant of the motion in proper cases is mandatory, and not a matter of discretion, for the Rule states in terms that the court <em>\u201cshall </em>order the entry of judgment of acquittal * * * if the evidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction.\u201d Rule 29(a). (Emphasis supplied.) See Cooper v. United States, 94 U.S.App.D.C. 343, 218 F.2d 39 (1954). The introduction of evidence after the denial of the motion does not \u201cwaive\u201d the motion so as to prevent appellate review of the sufficiency of the evidence. Hemphill v. United States, 312 U.S. 657, 61 S. Ct. 729, 85 L.Ed. 1106 (1941) <em>(per </em>curiam). If the denial of the motion was erroneous when made, it should be corrected on appeal. Few errors of law are as prejudicial to the defendant. Subsequent testimony cannot \u201ccure\u201d the error.
