S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas of the charges contained in Counts 8 through 15 relating to false income tax returns alleged to have been prepared by him. Counts 1 through 4 relate to alleged false income tax returns of the OTM Corporation, and as to these counts the jury was unable to agree upon a verdict. Counts 5 through 7 had to do with alleged false income tax returns of Burleigh Sanford, Sales Manager for the OTM Corporation, and the jury acquitted Hull on the Sanford counts. We do not question the sufficiency of the evidence to support the verdict of guilty as found by the jury, but we reverse because of errors committed during the trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b872-13\">The counts under which Hull was convicted charged that he did willfully and knowingly \u201c * * * aid and assist in, and counsel, procure and advise\u201d in the preparation and presentation to the District Director of Internal Revenue of false and fraudulent income tax returns of 3 salesmen in violation of Title 26 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 7208 (2) <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The salesmen were employees of the above mentioned corporation. Hull was a minor stockholder and was also Secretary. The corporation paid the salesmen involved, namely, Brown, Lahrmann and Holsombaek, a fixed salary plus an amount equal to 1% of their gross sales; and in some instances there was an additional allowance for automobile mileage.I. <footnotemark>2</footnotemark> The unreported commission sometimes exceeded the stated salary of the salesmen. There was testimony to the effect that the commission was paid to the salesmen to defray expenses in their selling en<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"819\">*819</page-number>deavors and their efforts to promote sales. The record clearly demonstrates that all of the commission paid to salesmen was not used for such purposes.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The salesmen were required to file a statement with the company relating to the amount of commissions each salesman was entitled to receive. All three salesmen admitted that their actual expenses did not equal the amount of the 1% commission.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> No accurate records were kept of expenses actually incurred. Each salesman asserted that he relied on the advice of the appellant Hull to the effect that it was not necessary to report the commissions. It is also evident from the record that the failure to report the commissions was a deliberate and considered conclusion, and often formed the basis of separate discussions between the salesmen involved and the appellant Hull. The practice was continued over a period of 3 or 4 years. The salesmen admitted that they considered the commission as extra compensation for services rendered; that a substantial portion of sums so received had not been expended for expenses incurred. There is ample evidence that the salesmen continued to make inquiry about reporting the commissions and questioned the accountant\u2019s advice that it was not necessary to report the same. There is no evidence that any of the salesmen sought counsel or advice from any other source. Unquestionably, the salesmen knew they were receiving income which was not reported in their respective returns.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b877-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number> Hull contends that the counts under which he was convicted are insufficient because they fail to state the amount of income which was not reported, resulting in an absence of essential facts upon which to base a conclusion that the returns were false as to \u201ca material matter\u201d. We disagree with the appellant and hold the counts involved to be sufficient. Gaunt v. United States, 1 Cir., 1950, 184 F.2d 284. We further conclude that there is no merit in Hull\u2019s contention that the trial court erred in failing to charge the jury that a showing of a tax deficiency is a prerequisite to conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b877-5\">There are 11 specifications of error. Some of them contain no merit, but we have concluded that there was error in the refusal of the trial court to instruct the jury as to the law applicable to the testimony of accomplices. We do not approve the written charge requested by the appellant as a correct statement of law on the subject, but that charge together with the objections of the defendant clearly and forcefully brought the question to the attention of the trial court. There was objection to the court\u2019s failure to charge on the subject. Of importance also is the fact that the court stated to the jury the court\u2019s opinion that the Government\u2019s case under the corporation counts was not nearly so strong as it was under the remaining counts having to do with income tax returns of the various salesmen.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Further, after the jury had deliberated for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>approximately an hour and a half, it returned to the courtroom and the foreman requested the court to restate its instructions to the jury as to the first 4 counts of the indictment, which were the counts relating to the OTM Corporation. Not only did the court have its oral charge re-read as to the first 4 counts, but the statement quoted in the margin referring to the counts involving the salesmen was read again to the jury. At this point, counsel for the appellant again called to the attention of the court the fact that it had refused to charge the jury as to accomplice testimony; and repeated appellant\u2019s objection to the emphasis of the court on the importance of the testimony of the salesmen. The jury was left with the emphasis naturally attendant upon the second reading of the charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-4\">As stated in our recent case of Dunn v. United States, 5 Cir., 1963, 318 F.2d 89, the better and safer practice is for counsel to submit a written request for instructions in accordance with Rule 30 F.R.Crim.P. As there pointed out however,<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> oral requests are sufficient if the court is clearly informed of the point involved. In the instant case the subject was brought to the court\u2019s attention by the requested charge, and by 2 separate and distinct objections on the part of the defendant pointing out the failure of the court to charge on the matter of accomplice testimony. One of the salesmen, Sanford, who appeared as a Government witness against Hull, was criminally prosecuted, entered a plea of guilty, and received a sentence in Federal court in Houston, Texas, under an indictment charging tax evasion, which charge arose out of, or at least related to substantially the same subject matter as that involved here. At the time of trial the other 3 salesmen, Lahrmann, Brown and Holsomback, had agreed to a 50% fraud penalty arising out of the very transactions for which Hull was being prosecuted. As pointed out in Dunn and in Phelps v. United States, 5 Cir. 1958, 252 F.2d 49, the existence of reversible error in a given case depends on the circumstances of that case and the conduct of the trial as a whole. In our view there was convincing evidence that the salesmen were accomplices with. Hull; but to say the least, there was ample evidence from which the jury could have drawn a valid conclusion that they were accomplices. We conclude that the jury should have had an opportunity to decide whether the salesmen who testified were accomplices, and then to weigh carefully the credibility of their testimony after receiving a proper cautionary instruction. Ward v. United States, 5 Cir. 1961, 296 F.2d 898. We reject the argument of the Government that the court\u2019s charge on credibility was sufficient in this case, where the record so clearly demonstrates the necessity of a charge on accomplice testimony. We do not criticize the charge as to its sufficiency on the subject of credibility, but a charge as to- credibility should not be taken as a substitute for an accomplice charge.</p>\n<p id=\"b878-8\">Prior to the trial, the Internal Revenue Service had audited the income tax returns of salesmen Brown, Holsomback and Lahrmann, certain adjustments were made, and the evidence shows that there were additions to the tax and fraud penalties were imposed. Indeed, the salesmen stated on the witness stand that their returns were false and in effect stated that they were aware of the fact that all income received by them was not included in the return. The tone of such testimony was to lay the blame on Hull. A careful reading of the record however, clearly demonstrates that each of the salesmen repeatedly engaged in discussions with Hull showing a consciousness of omissions of income, and questioned the advice they claimed Hull had given to them. They did not volun<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"825\">*825</page-number>tarily amend their returns prior to investigation <em>by </em>Internal Revenue Service, nor did they seek the advice of any other person. The salesmen acquiesced in the adjustments mentioned and accepted the reports of the Internal Revenue Agents as a substantially correct statement of their income.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-5\">The appellant issued a subpoena duces tecum to each of the salesmen requesting them to bring these reports to the trial. The reports were brought, but when the appellant Hull demanded to see them, the trial court refused to require the reports to be delivered in accordance with the subpoena, and left it to each salesman as to whether he desired to deliver such reports voluntarily. The court stated in open court that he did not see the relevancy of such reports. No question of self-incrimination or other objection was made and so far as we can determine, none was involved. The reports were not delivered solely because, as one witness stated: \u201cI don\u2019t see any point in taking up more time.\u201d At that point the court stated: \u201cI don\u2019t believe I do, either.\u201d To say the least, the salesmen were hostile to Hull. As pointed out by the court in its oral charge, the testimony of the salesmen was strong and direct against Hull. Any statement by them or conduct on their part which contradicted the testimony being given fropi the witness stand was vital and important. The evidence involved tended to contradict what the witnesses were stating. One of the chief issues in the case was whether the salesmen had fully informed the appellant Hull of all income received. One of the salesmen, Brown, admitted on the stand, for example, that he never did mention to Hull a substantial item of income re' ceived by him from a source not related to his business as salesman. It is clear to us that the salesmen should have been required to produce the reports in response to the subpoena in order to permit an examination of them; and if they were competent and relevant evidence, as is indicated, the defendant should have been permitted to use the same in cross-examining the witnesses who testified against him, all under the careful scrutiny and supervision of the trial court. Gordon v. United States, (1953) 344 U.S. 414, 73 S.Ct. 369, 97 L.Ed. 447.</p>\n<p id=\"b879-13\">The appellant Hull specifies errors for failure to permit him to examine certain reports and documents in the possession of revenue agents who testified at the trial in violation of the Jencks Act, 18 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 3500. The record with reference to this phase of the case is thoroughly muddled and confused. It is obvious that the defendant was permitted to examine some of the documents requested, but it cannot be determined with accuracy which ones he was permitted to examine and which ones were withheld.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> In order to avoid confusion <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"826\">*826</page-number>upon retrial of the case, the proceedings should be conducted in such manner that the record will eliminate the confusion as to the materials taken from the prosecutor\u2019s file which were given or shown to defendant\u2019s counsel; which ones were admitted into evidence, and which documents were withheld. This direction applies to all documents which may be involved. United States v. Bernard, 7 Cir. 1961, 287 F.2d 715; United States v. Cardillo, 2 Cir. 1936, 316 F.2d 606; Palermo v. United States, 1959, 360 U.S. 343, 79 S.Ct. 1217, 3 L.Ed.2d 1287; Campbell v. United States, 1963, 373 U.S. 478, 83 S.Ct. 1356, 10 L.Ed.2d 501.</p>\n<p id=\"b880-4\">We do not approve the following argument of the prosecuting attorney:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AIt\">\u201cYou have the opportunity, right now, to stop what this man has been doing. Counsel stated the Government had brought fifteen counts so that we would make this man look bad. Let me state right now, it could have been forty-five counts. Every act he did violates several different laws. That indictment could contain forty-five different counts. How many other things are wrong with the books and records out there no one knows.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b880-5\">Neither do we approve the following argument of defense counsel to which the prosecuting attorney was making response :</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AW4\">\u201c * * * A lot of times, they throw things, a lot of items like that at a person, hoping that the jury will get one on one side and one on the other,, and they will have a compromise- and say, \u2018Let\u2019s find him guilty on one or two counts.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b880-17\">Both arguments are improper and are' of like kind.

Immediately above the signature of the salesman was the statement: \u201cI certify that the above statements are correct and that expenditures were made as listed.\u201d Usually these monthly statements were approved by the Sales Manager or by one of the company officials.

Did you have other occasions to -\u00a1talk to him about those, except each time you sought to have him prepare your return?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AgS\">\u201cA. Yes, sir, it was discussed, other than just at the time we prepared the return.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQbq\">\u201cQ. Well, when you discussed it, what was discussed? Would you relate to these gentlemen what was discussed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AI_\">\u201cA. Well, I just asked them about\u2014 this was going on before I went to work there, and I asked them how to handle it, and he said not to turn it in, because if the company accepted it as expense,, there was no need in reporting it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aun\">\u201cQ. Then you asked him about whether they should be reported or not?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Alb\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7c\"><em>'Jfi </em>Hi $ \u2756 *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AZv\">\u201cA.

But they never made us have any receipts or anything, or whether we spent all of it, or more of it or less of it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A0e\">\u201cQ. You never did have a firm accounting, each month?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AEqE\">\u201cA. No, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGuN\">\u201cQ. And maybe some months you might go over, you might spend more money than you got; some months you might spend less. You say you spent about seventy-five per cent; did you ever spend, in one month, any more than you got?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AdZ\">\u201cA.

Still open.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AVq\">\u201cA. It is settled. It is not entirely paid up.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8d\">\u201cQ. Oh, you are paying it out a little bit at a time?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aes\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8n\">\u201cQ. Did they assess any penalties against you, Mr. Lahrmann?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ADb\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AOs4\">\u201cQ. A fraud penalty, fifty per cent ad valorem fraud penalty?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AF5\">\u201cA. Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-f\">\u201cQ.

I had my base salary and my car allowance, and I was given an additional pay, commission.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATq\">\u201cQ. You had a base salary, a car allowance, and some additional pay?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AuJ\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ax-\">\u201cQ. O.K., sir. How did you receive this additional pay? What was that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AaR\">\u201cA. Well, it was \u2014 Mr. Bradshaw just come up with a figure of two or three hundred, additional pay, to supplement my income, and he was counting it as a commission, on \u2014 I filled out a commission form.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AI_3\">\u201cTHE COURT: Commission on what?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AEO\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: Just an additional income, sir, and I filled it out on a regular salesman\u2019s commission form.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AM8\">\u201cTHE COURT: But it wasn\u2019t a commission, if I understand you?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AgzJ\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: No.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A68\">\u201cTHE COURT: You didn\u2019t sell anything?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ABN\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: No, sir.,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AOX\">\u201cQ.

What figures did you include on those forms, to get this additional compensation?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqH\">\u201cA. I didn\u2019t include it. Mr. Bradshaw would put down two and half or three hundred, depending on how many trips I made that month, and just whatever he wanted to increase my salary.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AlV\">V *i* -\u00cd*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AHd\">\u201cA.

Well, the percentage of the \u2014 the commission on the sales is not included on it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ajm\">\u201cQ. That is, for 1958?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ag7\">\u201cA.

Before you were a salesman, is the compensation you received, you said you received during 1957, is it reported on there?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ay9G\">\u201cA. I don\u2019t think so, no, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AVl\">\u201cTHE COURT: What part of 1957\u2019s income is not reported? You mean this business that you say one of the officers gave you, which might vary from month to month, something of that sort?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ASU\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: It did vary from month to month, yes, sir. In other words, I had a base salary, and if I made two or three trips, you know, to Chicago or something like that, in a plane, I may get three hundred dollars, or three hundred fifty, and if I didn\u2019t do much but work in the shop, I might get two hundred a month. It was just a figure he picked out.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A1iQ\">\u201cTHE COURT: That is what you secured by filling out one of these forms you showed us?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AzX\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Adp\">\u201cTHE COURT: And that is what was not included on your income tax?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AnF\">\u201cTHE WITNESS : Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aud\">\u201cQ.

Some of it was used, yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-b\">\u201cQ. Can you estimate how much was used during those two years?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AXf\">\u201cA. Well, I think in 1957 I made sixty-one hundred, and I think I spent about six hundred dollars for the year. *****</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ACa\">\u201cQ. After reading that statement, Mr. Holsomback, is your memory refreshed as to how much compensation you received that was not reported on that income tax return for 1957?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Anq\">\u201cA. Yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATW\">\u201cQ. How much is that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A4kq\">\u201cA. For the year \u201957, I believe it was sixty-seven hundred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ADh\">\u201cQ.

Sixty-one hundred.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AMp\">\u201cQ. And of that, how much did you actually spend for sales expense?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Auq\">\u201cA. Four hundred dollars.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AOCH\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well, now, these figures you have given us, sixty-seven <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"823\">*823</page-number>hundred for 1957 and sixty-one hundred for 1958, was that your total compensation, including salary, or was that this, what you called extra compensation that you got on the commission, by filling out the commission form?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"APv\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: There was extra, sir, besides this.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A-1\">\u201cTHE COURT: The salary was in addition to the sixty-seven hundred and in addition to the sixty-one hundred?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ABe\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: I think, yes, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Amnr\">$ $ * $ $</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ALU\">\u201cQ.

We discussed that, yes, sir.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AK2h\">\u201cQ. Would you tell us what you discussed?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AXc\">\u201cA. Well, we have asked \u2014 I asked Mr. Hull several times out at the company why we were not reporting the commis\u25a0sions, and he would say that we didn\u2019t have to, and not to worry about it.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Ai2L\">\u201cQ. Did you tell him that you had only those relatively small amounts of actual \u2022 expense that you have testified to, and -that the rest of it you did not spend for sales expense?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AQ1\">\u201cA. Well, he knew, yes, sir, about what -we were doing with it, because I was\u2014</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A3e\">\u201cQ. How did he know?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A6b3\">\u201cA.

When Mr. Hull would come out to the company, we would talk about this, and why wasn\u2019t it declared, and he said, \u2018Well, don\u2019t worry about it. We\u2019ll take care of it, don\u2019t worry about it.\u2019</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aoz\">\u201cTHE COURT: Well, now, what counsel asked you was, if Hull knew you had only spent about six hundred dollars one year and about four hundred dollars the second year on your business expenses, entertaining clients, and so forth, or customers, and so forth; was he aware of that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AO4\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: The exact amount I don\u2019t think he was, sir. But we were told we didn\u2019t have to worry about that, anyway.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ATR5\">\u201cTHE COURT: I know; but I am asking you how Mr. Hull knew about it, and whether you told him. Did you tell him at any time about how much you in fact were spending for these purposes?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AqZ\">\u201cTHE WITNESS: Well, I am sure that I did, sir.\u201d</blockquote>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b877-32\">. \u201cI might say to you that in my judgment, the Government\u2019s case is not nearly as strong on these O-T-M counts as is true on the remaining counts, having to do with the income tax returns for the various salesmen. The reason I say that is that it is undoubtedly true that these books and records out there were voluminous, that there has been no direct proof that Mr. Hull actually knew of these errors, and you must, if you find that he did know of these errors and these falsities in the income tax return, must more or less rely on the circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"824\">*824</page-number>stances of the case in reaching that decision; while as to the case of the several salesmen, there is direct proof from, I believe, each of the salesmen, that they told him and discussed with him the very matters which it is contended were false and fraudulent.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"7\">\n<p id=\"b878-12\">.

For example, certain documents were transmitted to this court in a sealed envelope with the notation \u201cGovernment tenders not admitted\u201d. The record repeatedly speaks of Government tenders to the court and Government tenders to the defendant, but the documents being tendered are often unidentified. The various tenders are not identified in the record by numbers. The record clearly shows that some of the documents requested were delivered to the appellant, but the appellant argues as though they were not.
