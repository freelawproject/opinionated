Appellant, Forest Britt Peter, having waived a jury trial, was found guilty of failure to submit to induction into the armed forces by the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, and was committed to the custody of the Attorney General for six months. Jurisdiction of this court is based on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 (1958).</p>\n<p id=\"b228-8\">On July 10, 1956, appellant registered for the Selective Service System with Local Board No. 53 in Hayward, California. On May 27, 1957, he completed and returned the standard classification questionnaire. He did not sign section VII of that questionnaire, relating to conscientious objector status, but submitted with the questionnaire a quotation from a poem which expressed opposition to war and a statement of his own concurring with the quotation.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On March 10, 1958, the local board received from him a completed SSS Form 150 relating to conscientious objector status. In answer to question 1 in series II, \u201cDo you believe in a Supreme Being?,\u201d he answered, \u201cIt depends on the definition. See 2 below.\u201d Question 2 of the series inquires as to the nature and quality of the belief, question 3 as to its source, and question 5 as to the circumstances, if any, in which force could be used; appellant referred to a separate sheet on which these questions were answered.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"175\">*175</page-number>He stated he was not a member of a religious sect or organization.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">On July 10, 1959, the local board by a 2-to-0 vote classified appellant I-A. On August 3, 1959, appellant appeared at a hearing before the local board where he substantially reiterated the views previously stated. The local board determined by a 2-to-0 vote not to open the case, and a notice of classification was mailed to appellant on August 4. On August 7, appellant wrote a letter to the board which reads as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-6\">\u201cDear Sirs,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-7\">\u201cThank you for your time the other night at the hearing. I\u2019m sorry you were unable to classify me as a Conscientious Objector.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-8\">\u201cThe decision however, was not a surprise considering my lack of \u2018proof\u2019 and your lack of moral courage.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-9\">\u201cI just hope the war you support won\u2019t kill us all in the next few years.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-10\">\u201cTo the future,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-11\">\u201cForest Britt Peter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-12\">The clerk of the local board interpreted this letter as a request for appeal and forwarded the file to the appeal board on September 9. On October 8, the Appeal Board for the Northern District of California \u201ctentatively determined that the registrant should not be classified in Class 1-0 or in a lower class,\u201d and forwarded the file to the Justice Department for investigation and hearing under section 6 (j) of the Universal Military Training and Service Act, 62 Stat. 609 (1948), as amended, 50 U.S.C. App., \u00a7 456(j) (1958). On July 29, 1960, the Conscientious Objector Section of the Justice Department recommended to the appeal board that appellant\u2019s claim not be sustained, and a copy was mailed to appellant together with a letter advising him that he had thirty days within which to reply to the recommendation.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Appellant\u2019s reply was a long letter alleging inaccuracies and irrelevancies in the hearing officer\u2019s report together with a lengthy dissertation on his beliefs, their nature, quality, and source. On November 18, 1960, the appeal board by a 5-to-0 vote continued the classification of I-A.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-19\">On July 20, 1961, appellant was ordered to report for a preinduction physical examination scheduled for August 30. Appellant replied with a letter dated August 15 which reads as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b229-20\">\u201cDear Sirs,</p>\n<p id=\"b229-21\">\u201cI will not appear for my Armed Forces Physical Examination August 30th, In accordance with my previously stated views and beliefs as a conscientious objector.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-22\">Appellant also forwarded a letter dated August 15, 1961.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Appellant was then ordered to report on November 22 for induction as a delinquent. He replied with a letter to the local board dated October 16 as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-23\">\u201cI recently received from you a notice of delinquency for my failure to report for an Armed Forces Physical Examination on August 30, 1961. I do not consider myself , delinquent. I remain as before, a conscientious objector to war and to all military institutions. I am a proponent of non violent action and reaction with other human beings, and I could not and will not partici<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"176\">*176</page-number>pate in a physical examination whose purpose is to define my fitness for service in the <em>Armed </em>Forces.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-4\">\u201cOnce again,</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-5\">\u201cForest Britt Peter.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">On advice of counsel, however, appellant reported to the Armed Forces Recruiting Station in Oakland, California, on the appointed day, and there refused to be processed for induction. He was not given a physical examination at that time. Appellant on later dates submitted letters to the local board, the California State Headquarters, and the Director of the Selective Service System, General Hershey, requesting a physical examination, with the avowed purpose of avoiding the effect of the doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies. These requests were denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">On September 26, 1962, appellant was indicted for refusing to submit to induction and was tried and found guilty by the district court without opinion on November 16, 1962.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">The issues in this case are: (1) Whether appellant qualifies as a conscientious objector; and (2) whether appellant was precluded from raising the defense because he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-10\">In Estep v. United States, 327 U.S. 114, 122-123, 66 S.Ct. 423, 427-428, 90 L.Ed. 567 (1946), the Supreme Court held that \u201cthe decisions of the local boards made in conformity with the regulations are final even though they may be erroneous. The question of jurisdiction of the local board is reached only if there is no basis in fact for the classification which it gave the registrant.\u201d Appellant contends that there was no basis in fact for the classification given him on the grounds that there is no evidence in the record that anyone at any time questioned the sincerity of his beliefs. The government contends that the local board and the Justice Department\u2019s hearing officer had the opportunity to observe the demeanor and attitude of the appellant in his appearances before them and that their refusals to classify him as a conscientious objector show some doubt as to his sincerity. There is some merit in the government\u2019s contention. However, even assuming that appellant was absolutely sincere, the record demonstrates that there was a basis in fact for the board\u2019s determination that he did not meet the statutory requirements for a conscientious objector.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b230-14\">Appellant concedes that exemption from service as a conscientious objector is not a matter of constitutional right but of legislative grace. To qualify for such a classification, a registrant must meet the standards set forth by Congress in section 6(j) of the Universal Military Training and Service Act, 62 Stat. 609 (1948), as amended, 50 U.S.C.App., \u00a7 456(j) (1958):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-15\">\u201cNothing contained in this title * * * shall be construed to require any person to be subject to combatant training and service in the armed forces of the United States who, <em>by reason of religious training and belief, </em>is conscientiously opposed to participation in war in any form. <em>Religious training and belief in this connection means an individual\u2019s belief in a relation to a Supreme Being involving duties superior to those arising from any human relation, but does not include essentially political, sociological, or philosophical views or a merely personal moral code.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.)</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-17\">Appellant contends that he meets the definition. His argument is that his beliefs have a religious foundation. In support of this, he stated at his trial:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b230-18\">\u201cA. I think my actions are probably motivated most thoroughly by a feeling of relationship and love towards other human beings and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>other living objects in the world, and in seeing these other living objects. I can narrow it down closer; I can define it as a belief in the mystery of the heart of them, the essence of being alive, and my respecting and loving this livingness in other objects and human beings.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-6\">\u201cQ. Well, now, in relation to the question of a Supreme Being-\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b231-7\"><em>\u201cA. </em>I suppose you could call that a belief in the Supreme Being or God. These just do not happen to be the words I use.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">In Berman v. United States, 156 F.2d 377, 380 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 329 U.S. 795, 67 S.Ct. 480, 91 L.Ed. 680 (1946), this court defined the standard set forth in the predecessor to this act as follows: \u201cIt is our opinion that the expression \u2018by reason of religious training and belief\u2019 is plain language, and was written into the statute for the specific purpose of distinguishing between a conscientious social belief, or a sincere devotion to a high moralistic philosophy, and one based upon an individual\u2019s belief in <em>his responsibility to an authority higher and beyond any worldly one.\u201d </em>(Emphasis added.) The court also quoted from United States v. Macintosh, 283 U.S. 605, 633-34, 51 S.Ct. 570, 578-79, 75 L.Ed. 1302 (1931) (Hughes, C.J., dissenting), that \u201cthe essence of religion is belief in a <em>relation to God involving duties superior </em>to those arising from any human relation.\u201d (Emphasis added.) It is true that when the <em>Berman </em>case was decided, there was no sentence in the statute defining \u201creligious training and belief.\u201d However, the present statute does contain such a definition, and it is by no means repugnant to the <em>Berman </em>definition. In fact, it adopts almost verbatim the wording from Mr. Chief Justice Hughes\u2019s dissent in <em>Macintosh </em>which the <em>Berman </em>court quoted with approval, changing only the word \u201cGod\u201d to \u201ca Supreme Being.\u201d In George v. United States, 196 F.2d 445, 451 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, 344 U.S. 843, 73 S.Ct. 58, 97 L.Ed. 656 (1952), this court in reaffirming the definition previously used stated that \u201cit is evident that the definition which the Congress introduced into the 1948 Amendment comports with the spirit in which \u2018Religion\u2019 is understood generally, and the manner in which it has been defined by the courts. It is couched in terms of the relationship of the individual to a Supreme Being, and comports with the standard or accepted understanding of the meaning of \u2018Religion\u2019 in American society.\u201d Appellant has made no good argument as to why the statutory definition should be overruled, and, indeed, it is far beyond the power of this court to change the definition placed in the act by Congress.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-12\"> It is significant that nowhere in the record of the proceedings before the administrative bodies did appellant manifest clearly and unequivocally a belief in a Supreme Being to Whom he owed obedience. When asked directly, \u201cDo you believe in a Supreme Being?,\u201d he answered, \u201cIt depends on the definition.\u201d Later he referred to the act of killing as \u201ca violation of moral law.\u201d Determination of his meaning and of his demeanor and attitude were functions of the administrative bodies, and it cannot be said that they were unreasonable in their determination. Such statements were quite consistent with \u201ca merely personal moral code,\u201d which is expressly excluded by Congress as a basis for classification as a conscientious objector. As was stated in the <em>Berman </em>case, 156 F.2d at 381, \u201cThere are those who have a philosophy of life, and who live up to it. There is evidence that this is so in regard to appellant. However, no matter how pure and admirable his standard may be, and no matter how devotedly he adheres to it, his philosophy and morals and social policy without the concept of deity cannot be said to be religion in the sense of that term as it is used in the statute.\u201d It was not until his trial for violation of the act that appellant reluctantly and grudgingly stated that his beliefs might be construed as a belief in a Supreme Being.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>We hold there was ample basis in fact for the determination by the selective service board that appellant\u2019s claim for \u25a0exemption did not come within the language of the statute.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b228-10\">. \u201c \u2018 * * * so in plain English;</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-11\">I am opposed to all war.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-12\">I don\u2019t believe human beings should kill each other.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-13\">I am opposed to all violence * * * for whatever reason.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-14\">I believe that wars will only end when men refuse to murder one another-for whatever reason.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-15\">I believe these things as a man and as a revolutionist.

Since human life is for me a final value, I consider it a violation of moral law to take human life. I think I have reached this conviction out of my reading of such writings as those of Blake (Christian mystic), Emerson, Whitman, and more modern poets who have touched on the question.</p>\n<p id=\"AUU\">\u201cI consider this belief to be superior to my obligation to the state.</p>\n<p id=\"Ab0\">\u201cIn so far as this conviction is religious, it has been best described by Rev. John Haynes Holmes as follows: \u2018Re-</p>\n<p id=\"Ajs\">ligion is the consciousness of some power manifest in nature which helps man in the ordering of his life in harmony with its demands * * * (it) is the supreme expression of human nature; it is man thinking his highest, feeling his deepest, and living his best.\u2019</p>\n<p id=\"Adl\">\u201c3. I would say that the source of my conviction concerning the sacredness of human life and the human spirit has been my experience and study in our democratic american culture, with its values derived from the western religious and philosophical tradition. As I have indicated above, I feel that I have learned of the values of this tradition through personal reading and meditation rather than through experience in any organized groups.</p>\n<p id=\"AUt\">\u201c6. The use of violence (physical force) comprises the ends one seeks in action.</p>\n<p id=\"AFb\">I consider war to be the greatest example of this. The use of non-violence in the freeing of India and the Montgomery bus strike is an example of the kind of force I do believe in.</p>\n<p id=\"AsK\">\u201cFOREST BRITT PETER \u201c3/10/58\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b229-13\">. \u201cThe Hearing Officer reported that he told the registrant that belief in a Supreme Being was required and that at no time did the registrant suggest that he had a belief in a Supreme Being; that in answering the Hearing Officer\u2019s question,</p>\n<p id=\"b229-14\">\u2018Are you prayerful?\u2019 the registrant had stated, \u2018No, I don\u2019t pray.\u2019 \u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b229-15\">\u2756 * *</p>\n<p id=\"b229-16\">\u201cThe Hearing Officer concluded that the registrant evidenced neither religious training and belief nor belief in a Supreme Being as defined in <em>the </em>Military Training and Service Act and the Hearing Officer recommended that the claim of the registrant, based upon grounds of conscientious objection, be not sustained.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b229-25\">.
