The asserted basis of jurisdiction is diversity of citizenship. Judge Rayfiel held that defendant American Airlines, Inc., while incorporated in Delaware, had its principal place of business in New York and dismissed the action for lack of jurisdiction, applying 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(c). In concluding that New York was the state where American Airlines, Inc. had its principal place of business, Judge Rayfiel correctly analyzed the facts of this particular case. He found that American\u2019s \u201cgeneral over-all management and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number>business policy is prescribed in and directed from New York\u201d where it also conducts a substantial operation; and the record shows that in other states where its physical volume of operation was larger (due in some part to their greater area), American maintained, for the most part, only officers concerned with the activities conducted there. There is no conflict between Judge Rayfiel\u2019s decision and Judge Weinfeld\u2019s in Scot Typewriter Co. v. Underwood Corp., D.C.S.D.N.Y., 1959, 170 F.Supp. 862, on the one hand, and the Third Circuit case of Kelly v. United States Steel Corporation, 3 Cir., 1960, 284 F.2d 850, on the other; in that case over-all management control was split between New York and Pennsylvania and the court found a predominance of activity in the latter state.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Since appellants have not been able to point to any single state which should be more properly regarded as American\u2019s principal place of business, the fact that New York activities are a modest fraction of the total proves nothing. The argument of appellants that jurisdiction should be sustained because \u201cthe vast majority of key activities and situs of operations of the * * * airline were performed and located outside of the State of New York\u201d is untenable [for the reason that it would lead to a (ruling that American Airlines, Inc., or j any other corporation which does not conJduct the majority of its activities in a i single state, has no principal place of business in any state \u2014 a result clearly (not contemplated by the Congress. See \u201clegislative history of 28 U.S.C., Section 1332 (c), United States Code Congressional and Administrative News, 85th Congress, Second Session, 1958, Yol. 2 at pp. 3101-3102. Such a fragmentation, followed by a comparison of \u201cthe key activities and situs of operations\u201d in one state with the aggregate of the \u201ckey activities and situs of operations\u201d in all other states, would emasculate the statute and defeat the underlying legislative intent. The statute was designed to prevent assertion, for purposes of diversity jurisdiction, that a corporation is a citizen exclusively of the state in which (perhaps as its sole connection) it obtained its corporate charter, and that it is not a citizen of the state in which it conducts its principal business activities. Furthermore, the act was intended to reduce substantially the caseload of the federal District Courts based upon diversity.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-8\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
