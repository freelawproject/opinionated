The District Court denied the relief. Since the entire sentence, without reduction for good time, has now been served and Appellant is no longer in the custody of the Warden of the Atlanta Penitentiary, the question presented is moot. The appeal must be dismissed for mootness.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-22\">Whether there was an illegal deprivation of good time, whether some procedure is available to judicially establish the facts, and whether any such determination would entitle Appellant to any relief including a reduction in the duration of his parole under supervision of the Parole Board are matters we need not, and do not, here decide.</p>\n<p id=\"b752-23\">Appeal dismissed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
