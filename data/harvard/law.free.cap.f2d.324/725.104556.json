We do not read the stipulation filed with tire Tax Court as precluding consideration of evidence extrinsic to the documents of sale bearing upon the intent of the taxpayer and the purchaser; and, of course, the parole evidence rule could not have that effect as between, the Commissioner and the taxpayer. Thorsness v. United States, 260 F.2d 341, 345 (7th Cir. 1958), and cases cited; Stern v. Commissioner, 137 F.2d 43, 46 (2d Cir. 1943).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-14\">2. The court properly held, as a matter of statutory construction, that the assumption of personal obligations of a taxpayer by a solvent third person may be treated as \u201cmoney received\u201d by the taxpayer, within the meaning of Section 1001(b) of the 1954 Code, to the amount of the obligations assumed. Cf. Crane v. Commissioner, 331 U.S. 1, 12-14, 67 S.Ct. 1047, 91 L.Ed. 1301 (1947); Commissioner v. Fortee Properties, Inc., 211 F.2d 915, 916 (2d Cir., 1954); Parker v. Delaney, 186 F.2d 455, 458 (1st Cir., 1950); R. O\u2019Dell &amp; Sons Co. v. Commissioner, 169 F.2d 247, 248 (3d Cir., 1948); Mendham Corporation v. Commissioner, 9 T.C. 320 (1947).</p>\n<p id=\"b780-16\">3. The essential findings of fact of the Tax Court are not clearly erroneous.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
