The defendant pleaded guilty to each charge and was sentenced to a period of five (5) years in the custody of the Attorney General.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-16\">On this Section 2255 (of Title 28 United States Code) motion, the appellant claims that the two charges have nothing to do with each other and are thus duplicitous and prejudicial. We think the two counts charged violations of \u201cthe same or similar character.\u201d Rule 8(a), Fed.R.Crim.P. Edwards v. Squier, 9 Cir. 1949, 178 F.2d 758. Further, any impropriety in the two counts would be harmless because of defendant\u2019s plea of guilty and the concurrence of the sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-19\">In his pro se brief, appellant further contends that the automobile which he transported was not stolen when he transported it, but was leased. There is no merit in this contention. See Miller v. United States, 4 Cir. 1958, 261 F.2d 546; Brown v. United States, 8 Cir. 1960, 277 F.2d 201.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-20\">The judgment is</p>\n<p id=\"b365-21\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
