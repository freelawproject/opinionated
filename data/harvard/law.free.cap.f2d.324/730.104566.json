The taxpayers introduced no evidence, and it is well settled that deficiency assessments of the Commissioner are presumptively correct. Welch v. Helvering, 290 U.S. 111, 115, 54 S.Ct. 8, 78 L.Ed. 212 (1933); Brown v. Commissioner, 141 F.2d 307, 309 (2 Cir. 1944). The argument made on this appeal that the government should have the burden of proof because a constructive dividend is a legal fiction is without legal or logical basis. The decision of the Tax Court is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
