Wolenski, presently confined in the Farview State Hospital in Way-mart, Pennsylvania, filed a petition in the district court requesting that the Orphans\u2019 Court of Delaware County be ordered to issue a decree and opinion on Wolenski\u2019s petition for removal of the guardian of his estate. The petitioner also requested that a lawyer be appointed to protect his interests. This appeal was taken from the order of the district \u2022court denying the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-17\">Treating the papers filed by the petitioner as requesting the district court to issue a writ of mandamus compelling-action by a state official, it is clear that the district court had no jurisdiction to grant such relief. Until recently only the District Court for the District of Columbia had original jurisdiction of an action in the nature of mandamus. Green v. United States, 283 F.2d 687 (C.A.3, 1960). In 1962 the Congress gave such jurisdiction to all Federal district courts, but only \u201cto compel an officer or employee of the United States or any agency thereof to perform a duty owed to the plaintiff.\u201d 76 Stat. 744, 28 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 1361. Thus, the district court was without power to compel the Orphans\u2019 Court to act in this matter.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-19\">The order of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
