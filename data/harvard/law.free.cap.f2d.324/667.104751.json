The objection is that the diagram was not drawn to scale and therefore tended to mislead the jury. There was no assertion at any time that the sketch was drawn to scale. Admittedly it was not. However, the various distances marked thereon were those measurements made by the witness while he was present at the locality represented in the diagram. Clearly the latter comes within \u201cThe general rule * * * that an illustrative diagram intended to portray existing facts may be employed if it is a correct portrayal of existing facts.\u201d Grayson v. Williams, 256 F.2d 61, 63 (10 Cir., 1958); cf. Thomas v. Conemaugh Black Lick Railroad, D.C., 133 F.Supp. 533, 541, aff\u2019d on other grounds, 234 F.2d 429 (3 Cir., 1956).</p>\n<p id=\"b722-15\">The remaining objection is that there was not sufficient proof offered on behalf of the Government to warrant the case being presented to the jury for decision. From our own independent examination of the evidence we are satisfied that the case was properly submitted to the jury on all four counts.</p>\n<p id=\"b722-16\">The judgment of the district court will be affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
