His opinion appears at 217 F.Supp. 873.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-14\">This is an action brought by the administrator of Klinkhammer\u2019s estate to recover damages for his injury and death under the Connecticut Wrongful Death statute. Section 52-555 Conn.Gen.Stats. (1958 Revision). The decedent was a resident of Connecticut and all persons interested as beneficiaries of his estate are citizens of Connecticut, as are also the defendants. Federal jurisdiction is based on diverse citizenship, the plaintiff administrator being a citizen of Pennsylvania.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-15\">The facts are undisputed. On January 6, 1961, the Probate Court of North Branford appointed the decedent\u2019s mother administrator of his estate. She resigned shortly thereafter and Lang was appointed her successor. This was for the purpose of creating diversity of citizenship so that suit could be brought in the federal court. The action was commenced November 1, 1961.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-16\"> The appeal presents two questions: (1) Did 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1359 require dismissal because Lang \u201chas been improperly or collusively made or joined to invoke the jurisdiction\u201d of the federal court? Relying upon Corabi v. Auto Racing, Inc., 3 Cir., 264 F.2d 784, 75 A.L.R.2d 711, which is precisely in point, Judge Timbers held it did not. We agree with his decision. (2) The second question concerns the interpretation of a Connecticut statute, \u00a7 52-21 Conn.Gen. Stats. Appellant contends this destroys diversity jurisdiction. Judge Timbers held it did not. Again we agree with him.</p>\n<p id=\"b290-17\">Both counsel have argued the appeal with great ability. It has been a pleasure to hear such able arguments. But we <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"237\">*237</page-number>see no necessity of adding to Judge Timbers\u2019 thorough and well-reasoned opinion which discussed the pertinent authorities. The order is affirmed on the opinion below.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
