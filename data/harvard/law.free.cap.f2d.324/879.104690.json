In short it is argued that because the confessions made during the \u201cunnecessary delay\u201d are inadmissible, the testimony of an eyewitness to the crime must also be suppressed because the existence of the eyewitness was revealed to police by appellants during the same period of time.</p>\n<p id=\"b933-34\">Appellant Smith, in No. 17466, was found guilty of so-called felony murder, D.C.Code Ann. \u00a7 22-2401 (1961), of second degree murder and of robbery. Bowden in No. 17534 was found guilty <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"880\">*880</page-number>of robbery. Neither appellant testified and the evidence as to the events comes' from the eyewitness whose testimony was sought to be suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-4\">Undisputed testimony from Philip Holman, the challenged witness, shows that Smith and Bowden set out with Holman, age 14, one evening from Bowden\u2019s home. By 7:45 p. m. the trio had reached Kalorama Park, where they separated, Smith continuing on one side of the street while Bowden and Holman remained on the other. Holman\u2019s testimony at the trial was that a man got out of a car and Smith approached him from behind and beat him repeatedly on the head, using a tree limb as a club. Bowden immediately crossed the street to join Smith and, after plundering the body of the victim, the two ran from the scene of the crime, with Holman following, to Dupont Circle. There they divided the stolen money.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-5\">The victim was Miksa Merson, a 65-year-old pianist and music teacher. He had been struck down a few steps from his home at 2314 Ashmeade Place, N. W. Within minutes a passerby discovered Merson badly beaten and covered with blood. Emergency treatment at Georgetown Hospital was unavailing and he died shortly after reaching the hospital.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-6\">The police had few clues. They discovered the club used in the killing and two cards dropped from Merson\u2019s wallet. Five days after the crime the Chief of Police received an envelope from an unknown source containing an anonymous note and eleven credit and identity cards representing personal papers of the deceased. One of the cards contained an identifiable palm print. The police also knew that the dead man\u2019s gold watch was missing. Six days after the slaying the police did not know how many persons were involved in the killing, nor did they have any \u201cleads\u201d as to the identity of the killer.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-7\">On Friday evening, March 9, the police arrested Smith and Bowden in connection with another robbery in the vicinity of the Merson killing. Their arrest was unrelated to the Merson killing for at this time Smith and Bowden were not linked to that case. When the victim of the second robbery failed to identify either appellant, Bowden, the juvenile, was released, but Smith was detained overnight for the purpose of presenting him in a line-up the next morning. We will return later to the legal questions raised by detaining Smith in these circumstances.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-9\">Detective Preston, the homicide officer primarily responsible for the investigation of the Merson murder, observed Smith in the line-up on Saturday morning March 10, and learning of the circumstances of his arrest suspected a connection with the Merson case. He sent for Smith and questioned him that morning; at 10:05 Smith\u2019s fingerprints and palm prints were taken. At about 11:20 Smith took a polygraph examination, which was completed at 2:00 p. m.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-10\">Meanwhile, at 10:30 a. m., Officer Eccles went to Bowden's home and, after Bowden agreed to accompany him, took him to the homicide office, where he remained for about a half hour without questioning. Eccles noticed that Bowden was wearing a watch matching the description of the watch believed to have been taken from Merson. When Bowden could not adequately account for possession of the watch, Eccles retained it. The watch was later definitely identified as Merson\u2019s. On completion of a polygraph test given at his own request, Bowden was questioned by Detective Preston at 2:00 p. m. Bowden confessed, implicated Smith and offered to aid in a reenactment of the events. This he did, after which he signed a written statement admitting his role in the crime and describing Smith\u2019s part.</p>\n<p id=\"b934-11\">On Sunday morning Smith, who was now in his second day of detention without being presented to a judicial officer and who had not yet admitted involvement in the crime, was questioned. Smith spoke freely and willingly at the Sunday morning interview and confessed to the murder. In this oral confession Smith referred to a third person at the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"881\">*881</page-number>scene of the crime. A few minutes after Smith\u2019s confession, Bowden arrived at the homicide office and the two repeated their confessions. Both referred to the third person as a boy called \u201cBed,\u201d told the police the general area where he lived, and told them that a picture of \u201cBed\u201d was in police records. From these leads the police were able to locate Holman.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-5\">On these appeals it is urged (1) that it was error to receive Holman\u2019s testimony because the police found this witness as a result of information obtained while appellants were illegally in custody and (2) that it was error to admit in evidence Smith\u2019s palm print obtained from him on the day before trial, which palm print corresponded with the palm print on the automobile registration card of the decedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-6\">The District Court correctly ruled that oral and written confessions were inadmissible because they were made during a period of illegal detention. The prosecution conceded that the Mallory ease was controlling as to the confession of Smith, and the Harling<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> case controlled as to Bowden.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-7\">In essence these appeals present the familiar \u201cfruit of the poisonous tree\u201d argument but in a novel form not unlike that presented in Payne v. United States, 111 U.S.App.D.C. 94, 294 F.2d 723 (1961), cert. denied, 368 U.S. 883, 82 S.Ct. 131, 7 L.Ed.2d 83. The crucial evidence against Smith was the testimony of Holman, the eyewitness to the crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-8\">Courts have gone a long way in suppressing evidence but no case as yet has held that a jury should be denied the testimony of an eyewitness to a crime because of the circumstances in which his existence and identity was learned. However, in our view, the relationship between the inadmissible confessions and Holman\u2019s testimony in the District Court months later is so attenuated that there is no rational basis for excluding it. No case has been cited to us in which the testimony of an eyewitness or factual witness has been excluded because his identity was discovered as a result of disclosures made by an accused during detention violative of Buie 5(a) Fed.B. Crim.P. Bynum v. United States, 104 U.S.App.D.C. 368, 262 F.2d 465 (1958), is not applicable. Cf. Bynum v. United States, 107 U.S.App.D.C. 109, 274 F.2d 767 (1960).</p>\n<p id=\"b935-12\">The District Judge correctly read this court\u2019s holding in Killough v. United States, 114 U.S.App.D.C. 305, 315 F.2d 241 (1962), as not requiring the exclusion of Holman\u2019s testimony. Neither the Killough holding, the Mallory holding nor anjr other case would warrant excluding Holman\u2019s testimony. The fact that the <em>source </em>of evidence is \u201ctainted\u201d by violation of constitutional or statutory provisions has not precluded the use of that evidence in every circumstance. See Walder v. United States, 347 U.S. 62, 74 S.Ct. 354, 98 L.Ed. 503 (1954). Compare Lockley v. United States, 106 U.S.App.D.C. 163, 166, 270 F.2d 915, 918 (1959) (dissenting opinion); see also Barkley v. United States, 116 U.S.App.D.C. -, 323 F.2d 804, p. 805 (1963) n. 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b935-15\">Here no confessions or utterances of the appellants were used against them; tangible evidence obtained from appellants, such as the victim\u2019s watch, was suppressed along with the confessions. But a witness is not an inanimate object which like contraband narcotics, a pistol or stolen goods, \u201cspeak for themselves.\u201d The proffer of a living witness is not to be mechanically equated with the proffer of inanimate evidentiary objects illegally seized. The fact that the name of a potential witness is disclosed to police is of no evidentiary significance, per se, since the living witness is an individual human personality whose attributes of will, perception, memory and volition interact to determine what testimony he will give.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>The uniqueness of this human process distinguishes the evidentiary character of a witness from the relative immutability of inanimate evidence.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b936-4\">We dealt with this problem recently in a different factual setting in which we rejected the very \u201cfruit\u201d type argument made by appellants here. In Payne v. United States, supra, Judge Washington, speaking for a unanimous court, said:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b936-5\">\u201cIn this case appellant\u2019s lengthy detention produced two things\u2014 Warren\u2019s identification of Payne [at a lineup], and Payne\u2019s admission of guilt. The latter, the admission, was excluded from evidence by the trial judge under the rule in Mallory\u2014 rightly, we think, though the point is not before us for decision. * * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b936-6\">\u201cAppellant says that but for his detention he \u2018would have blended back into the mass of the population\u2019, and would have remained at large. He cites our ruling in Bynum v. United States, 1958, 104 U.S.App. D.C. 368, 262 F.2d 465, * * * But we later affirmed Bynum\u2019s conviction after a second trial, at which the prosecutor introduced a fingerprint other than that taken during the period of illegal detention, <em>but which he was able to obtain because he knew Bynum\u2019s identity as a result of the fingerprints taken during that period. </em>See 1960, 107 U.S.App. D.C. 109, 274 F.2d 767. Implicit in our second holding was a rejection of the sort of \u2018fruit of the poisonous tree\u2019 argument advanced in the instant case.\u201d (Emphasis added.) 111 U.S.App.D.C. at 97-98, 294 F.2d at 726-727 (1961).</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b936-11\">Judge Washington concluded that to suppress the testimony of the witness Warren simply because he had identified Payne as the robber at a police line-up during his illegal detention would be \u201cunthinkable.\u201d Mr. Justice Jackson would appear to have had something like this in mind when he expressed unwillingness to debase constitutional doctrine \u201cby making of them mere technical loopholes for the escape of the guilty. The petitioners have had fair trial and fair review. The people of the State are also entitled to due process of law.\u201d Stein v. People of State of New York, 346 U.S. 156, 196, 73 S.Ct. 1077, 1098, 97 L.Ed. 1522 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b936-12\"> We find no error in the admission of the palm print of Smith taken the day before trial for purposes of comparison with the palm print on the victim\u2019s credit cards. Unlike the situation in Bynum v. United States, 104 U.S.App.D.C. 368, 262 F.2d 465 (1958), appellant here was in lawful custody at the time his prints were recorded. Cf. Bynum v. United States, 107 U.S.App.D.C. 109, 274 F.2d 767 (1960) (per curiam). And it is elementary that a person in lawful custody may be required to submit to photographing, United States v. Amorosa, 167 F.2d 596, 599 (3d Cir., 1948), and fingerprinting, United States v. Krapf, 285 F.2d 647, 650-651 (3d Cir., 1961), as part of routine identification processes. United States v. Kelly, 55 F.2d 67, 83 A.L.R. 122 (2d Cir., 1932).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"883\">*883</page-number>Appellant Bowden contends he was entitled to a judgment of acquittal on his robbery indictment at the close of the government\u2019s case. Here, as in Hunt v. United States, 115 U.S.App.D.C. 1, 316 F.2d 652, 654 (1963), \u201cappellant fragments the Government\u2019s case and then seeks to show that each fragment considered in isolation is consistent with an hypothesis of innocence.\u201d See United States v. Masiello, 235 F.2d 279, 283 (2nd Cir.) cert. denied sub nom., Stickel v. United States, 352 U.S. 882, 77 S.Ct. 100, 1 L.Ed.2d 79 (1956). But the jury was obliged to determine whether the government\u2019s evidence as a whole established Bowden\u2019s guilt of the robbery beyond a reasonable doubt. The totality of the evidence, direct and circumstantial, was sufficient to warrant a verdict of guilty.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b937-5\">The judgments of the District Court are</p>\n<p id=\"b937-6\">Affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b935-9\">. [Harling v. United States] 111 U.S.App. D.C. 174, 295 F.2d 161 (1961).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b935-16\">. This is illustrated here by the circumstance that when initially located Hoi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"882\">*882</page-number>man gave no information adverse to appellants; only after reflection and the interaction of these faculties of human personality did Holman eventually relate to the jury the events of the night of the killing. These factors in part account for the rule allowing a party to cross-examine his own witness on a claim of surprise and ultimately to impeach his own witness.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b936-9\">. This distinction is not foreclosed by the recent Supreme Court decision in Wong Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471, 83 S.Ct. 407, 9 L.Ed.2d 441 (1963), as the dissenting opinion suggests; in Wong Sun, it was not eyewitness testimony that the Supreme Court held subject to suppression, but rather a package of narcotics. Moreover, a statement excluded by the Court was uttered by one of the defendants at the time of an unconstitutional police entry and arrest. 371 U.S. at 485 \u2014 486, 83 S.Ct. at 416, 9 L.Ed.2d 441. Here it is not some <em>prior </em>utterance of appellants or Holman which is sought to be suppressed, but the testimony of an eyewitness to an event.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b937-11\">. The record discloses that Smith came to Bowden\u2019s home early in the evening of the killing and said to Bowden \u201csomething about making money,\u201d after which Smith, Bowden and Holman went to the vicinity of the crime. Smith, Bowden and Holman were observed by one witness as they were walking through a park immediately adjacent to the place of the attack; when Smith drew near her, the witness became frightened and screamed whereupon Smith said, \u201cI am not going to hurt you; don\u2019t be afraid.\u201d According to Holman\u2019s testimony, Smith at this time was \u201ca little in front of\u201d Bowden and Holman and near enough so that Holman heard Smith\u2019s statement to the woman. Holman testified that he, Smith and Bowden continued through the park, Smith picked up a tree branch (later used to club Merson) and told Holman \u201cto put it under [his] coat [because] he [Smith] didn\u2019t want the police to see it.\u201d Holman\u2019s testimony further showed that he and Bowden were directly across the street from where the attack occurred and near enough so that Holman heard the blows on Merson\u2019s head. Shortly after Smith struck Merson, Holman saw Bowden \u201cgo across the street\u201d \u201cto see what [had] happened to Smith.\u201d Smith and Bowden then ran past him and he followed.</p>\n<p id=\"A1s\">Immediately after the attack and before Merson lost consciousness, the witness Branch found Merson and asked him-what had happened, to which Merson replied \u201cThey hit me.\u201d Branch asked\u00a1 \u201cWho hit you?\u201d and he repeated \u201cThey hit me.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"ASJq\">Holman\u2019s testimony concerning division, of Merson\u2019s money was that after the attack Smith gave Bowden something over-twenty dollars but gave Holman only ten dollars commenting \u201cWhat do you expect for nothing. * * * if you just came across the street and searched-the man\u2019s pockets, you would have gotten, some more.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b937-7\">BAZELON, Chief Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AQhn\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b937-8\">To \u201cavoid all the evil implications of secret interrogation,\u201d McNabb v. United States, 318 U.S. 332, 344, 63 S.Ct. 608, 87 L.Ed. 819 (1943), Rule 5(a) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure requires police to bring an arrested person before a committing magistrate \u201cwithout unnecessary delay.\u201d Experience shows the temptation to violate this command is so great that police will not voluntarily comply, and the legislature and executive have been either unable or unwilling to employ effective methods to insure compliance.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> To protect the rights of arrested persons, the Supreme Court has found it necessary to exclude evidence obtained through violation of Rule 5(a). McNabb v. United States, supra; Mallory v. United States, 354 U.S. 449, 77 S.Ct. 1356, 1 L.Ed.2d 1479 (1957). The circumstances revealed by the record in this case plainly demonstrate that these rights will be a dead-letter unless courts continue to apply McNabb-Mallory when evidence is obtained in violation of the Rule.</p>\n<p id=\"b937-10\">Not only evidence directly obtained by illegal detention of a suspect but also the \u201cfruit\u201d or \u201cproduct\u201d of information so obtained must be excluded from use at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>trial.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> What is a \u201cfruit\u201d or \u201cproduct\u201d must be determined in the light of the need to discourage violation of the Rule. In the present case, police detained appellant Smith and questioned him intermittently for forty hours <footnotemark>3</footnotemark> before eliciting both his confession and substantial clues to the identity of an eyewitness. Since the clues thus obtained enabled the police to locate the witness Holman with little difficulty and thereafter obtain his testimony,<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> the link between the illegal questioning of Smith and the testimony of Holman was not attenuated.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> To admit Holman\u2019s testimony puts a premium on violation of Rule 5(a) and provides an incentive for continuing to violate it.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b938-4\">I would therefore reverse Smith\u2019s conviction and order a new trial. Since Holman\u2019s testimony implicated not only Smith but his co-defendant Bowden as well, I would also reverse and order a new trial as to Bowden. Anderson v. United States, 318 U.S. 350, 63 S.Ct. 599, 87 L.Ed. 829 (1943); see MacDonald v. United States, 335 U.S. 451, 69 S.Ct. 191, 93 L.Ed. 153 (1948).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b937-16\">.

Nor do I think attenuation is shown by the refusal of Holman, who testified against appellants at trial, to do so at the coroner\u2019s inquest.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b938-25\">. The majority would except the oral testimony of a \u201cliving witness\u201d from the \u201cfruit of the poisoned tree\u201d doctrine, on the ground that a witness is an \u201cindividual human personality\u201d possessing \u201cattributes of will, perception, memory and volition.\u201d The reasoning seems to be that since these human faculties operate in deciding what evidence the witness will give, the decision is an intervening voluntary act which dissipates the taint of the original illegality. But this contradicts Wong Sun v. United States. In that case, where an \u201cindividual human personality\u201d named Tee gave narcotics to the police, the Supreme Court excluded the narcotics as \u201cpoisoned fruit\u201d because the police learned of Tee from the illegally-arrested Toy. 371 U.S. 471, 487-488, 83 S.Ct. 407, 417, 9 L.Ed.2d 44 (1963). Thus it appears that the decision to give certain evidence is not the kind of intervening voluntary act of an \u201cindividual human personality\u201d that dissipates the taint of original illegality.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
