The trial court, without a hearing, denied relief. On his prior application appellant contended that his guilty plea was not made voluntarily and understanding^. The trial court held to the contrary and we affirmed. Bailey v. United States, 10 Cir., 312 F.2d 679.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-20\">Appellant now contends that the sentence should be vacated because the prosecution followed an illegal arrest and search. We have held to the contrary in a case brought by a codefendant. See Sullivan v. United States, 10 Cir., 315 F.2d 304.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-21\">Appellant says that the present application should not have been denied without a hearing. The contention is without merit. As we pointed out in Sullivan, if the guilty plea was voluntary, the allegedly illegal conduct is no ground for relief under \u00a7 2255. In the prior \u00a7 2255 application we held that the guilty plea was made knowingly and voluntarily.</p>\n<p id=\"b686-22\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
