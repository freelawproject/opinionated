He first urges that it was error to admit testimony that when he was arrested, about eight months after the offense, he gave a fictitious name. The evidence was admissible both as justifying an inference of guilt by hiding under an assumed name and as proof of identity.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-24\">The second point is that the argument of the prosecutor in addressing the jury that \u201cthe case must go without any contradiction that the defendant\u201d transported moonshine whiskey, was a prohibited comment on the appellant\u2019s failure to testify. The law is otherwise. Garcia v. United States, 5th Cir. 1963, 315 F.2d 133.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-25\">There is no showing of error. The judgment and sentence of the district court are</p>\n<p id=\"b232-26\">Affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
