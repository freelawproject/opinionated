In February 1963 the plaintiff moved to vacate the discontinuance and to grant judgment against Muse Products, Inc., for liquidated damages of $1,000. The motion was supported by plaintiff\u2019s affidavit. His obligation under the stipulation was to supply two successive sets of ten musical compositions, from each of which defendants were obligated to select at least one composition for commercial release. Plaintiff\u2019s affidavit lists the names of the musical compositions he supplied; states that defendants did not perform their obligation to select one from each set for commercial release and claims that they are obligated to pay liquidated \u2022damages of $500 for each default.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-14\">In opposition, the affidavit of Eric Bemay admitted that Muse Products, Inc. \u201cagreed to record and commercially release two original musical compositions composed by plaintiff pursuant to certain terms set forth in the stipulation.\u201d The affidavit continues:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b546-16\">\u201c(c) On or about November 9, 1961 the first of the plaintiff\u2019s compositions was recorded and a commercially acceptable phonograph recording was released through normal trade channels. In conjunction therewith, royalty payments have been made to the plaintiff as is indicated by the photostatic copy of a royalty statement annexed hereto as Exhibit \u20181.\u2019 \u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b546-17\">\u201cExhibit 1\u201d shows royalty payments of $11.24 on a musical composition entitled \u201cDream Girl.\u201d No composition by that name appears in plaintiff\u2019s 1961 list of compositions given to defendants. Without mentioning this fact the district judge denied the plaintiff\u2019s motion on the ground that he \u201chas failed to sustain his burden of proving non-compliance with the stipulation.\u201d Failure of the judge to mention that \u201cDream Girl\u201d was not included in plaintiff\u2019s 1961 list does not compel the inference that the judge overlooked that fact. He may well have inferred that the acceptance of royalty payments on \u201cDream Girl,\u201d which plaintiff did not deny, indicated plaintiff\u2019s consent to substituting that song for one that was listed, or to changing the name of a listed song. Plaintiff had the burden of proving defendant\u2019s breach of contract and his proof was insufficient to establish it.</p>\n<p id=\"b546-18\">With respect to the second set of compositions Bernay\u2019s affidavit states that one entitled \u201cFoggy Morning\u201d has been recorded and plaintiff \u201cagreed that it would be advisable not to release the second record, until such time as the greatest benefits could be derived from the sales thereof.\u201d The second set of compositions does not include one entitled \u201cFoggy Morning,\u201d but does have one entitled \u201cMist.\u201d Possibly the latter name was changed with plaintiff\u2019s consent. But however that may be, plaintiff accepted the recording of \u201cFoggy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"493\">*493</page-number>Morning\u201d as proper and agreed to postpone its release. Consequently with respect to the second set of compositions plaintiff also failed to carry his burden of proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b547-4\">Denial of plaintiff\u2019s motion for judgment is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
