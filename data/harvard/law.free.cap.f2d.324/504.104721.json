As the amounts involved are small and appellant\u2019s witnesses, or some of them, must travel from New York City to Vermont for the trial, we suggest that all allegations of the petition be deemed denied and that at least ten days notice of the time and place of the hearing be given to appellant at Fifth Floor, 2 John Street, New York 38, N. Y. If appellant prefers to serve an answer it may do so, at least five days before the date fixed for the hearing. Whether some of appellant\u2019s motion papers were lost on the subway in New York City has no relevancy to any of the issues arising out of the petition in bankruptcy, so far as we can see. Nor does the record disclose any reason to suppose that the statement that the papers were lost is a fabrication.</p>\n<p id=\"b558-22\">Remanded.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
