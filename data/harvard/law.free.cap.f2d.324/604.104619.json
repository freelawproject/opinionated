It appeals here from the District Court\u2019s dismissal of its complaint whereby it sought to have the order of the Commission set aside.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-14\">The articles involved are manufactured in a forging process. They are made to specifications required for installation in General Motors automobiles. As shipped, they are finished and ready for such installation. The terms \u201cforgings\u201d and \u201cautomobile parts\u201d are both descriptive of the articles involved. The Commission found that \u201cautomobile parts\u201d was the more specific designation for the shipments. If so, the Commission was correct in applying the \u201cautomobile parts\u201d tariff. United States v. Gulf Refining Co., 268 U.S, 542, 546, 45 S.Ct. 597, 69 L.Ed. 1082.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-15\">In published tariffs there is a general heading, \u201cManufactured Iron and Steel Articles\u201d under which is found a classification of \u201cforgings.\u201d Under another general heading, \u201cAutomobile Parts or Accessories\u201d are tariffs for \u201cbumper or bumper fittings\u201d and for \u201cautomobile parts, noibn,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> iron or steel.\u201d In its decision, the Commission held that, \u201cthe applicable rates on bumper back bars were, and are, those published for automobile bumpers and bumper fittings or, in the absence of such description, those on automobile parts noibn, iron or steel, and that the applicable rates on stabilizer bars were, and are, those published for automobile parts.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b659-16\"> Unless the Commission\u2019s findings were contrary to law, were arbitrary or capricious, or were unsupported by substantial evidence, neither this Court nor a District Court is at liberty to set them aside. General Motors Corp. v. United States, 299 F.2d 233, 236 (C.A. 6, 1962); Great Lakes Steel Corp. v. United States, 220 F.2d 751 (C.A. 6, 1955), cert. denied 350 U.S. 821, 76 S.Ct. 47, 100 L.Ed. 734. Cf. Universal Camera Corp. v. N. L. R. B., 340 U.S. 474, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456. From our review of the record, we are satisfied that the District Judge followed applicable law in concluding that, as to the Commission\u2019s decision, \u201cthere was substantial evidence based on the whole record to support the finding that the two ar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>tides in question were automobile parts and, in so finding, the Commission did not act arbitrarily, capriciously or abuse its discretion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">The opinion of the District Court more fully details the evidence. It adequately discusses the issues and the applicable law. It is reported as General Motors Corp. v. United States, D.C., 207 F.Supp. 641.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-5\">Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b659-17\">. The term \u201cnoibn\u201d as used means \u201cnot otherwise indexed by name * * * and not rated more specifically in this classification.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
