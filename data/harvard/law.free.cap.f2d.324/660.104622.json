SPENCER BELL, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b715-22\">The plaintiff, a longshoreman, brought this action against the shipowner, American Export Lines, Inc., for injuries which occurred during loading operations, alleging unseaworthiness, negligence, and violation of safety regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Labor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>under the Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act as amended. (33 U.S.C. \u00a7 941). The shipowner in turn filed a third party complaint against the stevedore employer of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p id=\"b716-4\">Plaintiff was working as a \u201crelief deck man\u201d when a draft of cargo being loaded into the No. 2 hatch of the SS EXAMINER swung back in a pendulum-like motion, striking some metal hatch beams which fell or tipped over on the plaintiff\u2019s legs and broke them. The beams had been removed from the square of the hatch and stored on the inshore side of the ship between the hatch coaming and the waistplate. The testimony was conflicting as to whether or not and, if they were, how securely the beams were lashed. The plaintiff was standing between the beams and the ship rail near the after end of the hatch, from which point he was signaling to the winch drivers and giving orders to the men on the pier. Two winches located at the forward end of the hatch were being used to work the cargo in cooperation. The \u201cinshore\u201d winch picked up the draft and raised it above the level of the ship\u2019s rail and the hatch coaming; the \u201cup and down\u201d winch then pulled the load over the hatch opening preparatory to lowering it into the hold. As the cables of both winches were attached to the same load, they were in effect pulling against each other as the load was pulled from the pier to the hatch, thus it was necessary for the inshore winch to pay out its cable as the \u201cup and down\u201d winch retracted its line. During this operation, the up and down winch cut out while the inshore winch continued momentarily to pay out its line. This relieved the tension on the \u201cjoint\u201d line, causing the load to swing down, striking the hatch beams, one or more of which struck the plaintiff. There was a conflict of evidence as to whether the \u201cup and down\u201d winch had previously cut out on several occasions that morning. There was also conflicting evidence as to whether the winch was in proper operating condition. The plaintiff contended both that the winch was in an unseaworthy condition and that both the manner and place of storing the hatch beams constituted the ship unseaworthy with respect thereto. The usual interrogatories on seaworthiness, negligence, and contributory negligence were submitted. The court charged the jury that if they found the ship to be seaworthy in all respects they need not reach the other interrogatories. The jury answered the first interrogatory as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-6\">\u201c1. Was the SS EXAMINER unseaworthy with respect to \u201c(a) the starboard winch of the Number 2 hatch?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-7\">\u201cAnswer (\u2018yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019) NO \u201c(b) the place and/or the manner of stowing the hatch beams on the deck of the vessel ?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-8\">\u201cAnswer (\u2018Yes\u2019 or \u2018no\u2019) NO.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-9\">The plaintiff appeals, alleging numerous errors in the trial of the case. Upon a reading of the charge as a whole we must reject the plaintiff\u2019s contention, which is the basis for many of his specific objections, that the charge devitalizes the doctrine of unseaworthiness. The charge is relatively long, and the court conscientiously undertook meticulously to present the contentions of each of the parties on the many points of law involved. It appears to us that the jury could not have failed to understand the court\u2019s statement that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b716-10\">\u201cLiability for an unseaworthy condition does not in any way depend upon negligence or fault or blame, that is to say, the shipowner is liable for all the injuries and consequent damage proximately caused by an unseaworthy condition existing at any time even though the owner may have exercised due care under the circumstances and may have had no notice or knowledge of the unseaworthy condition which proximately caused the damage.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b716-11\">The substance of this statement was repeated several times. We agree with the trial court that while the duty to furnish a seaworthy vessel is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"663\">*663</page-number>an absolute, inalienable, non-delegable and continuing duty of the shipowner it does not make him an insurer of the safety of his crew. A seaworthy ship is one which is reasonably fit for its intended use. Gutierrez v. Waterman Steamship Corp., 373 U.S. 206, 213, 83 S.Ct. 1185, 10 L.Ed.2d 297 (1963); Mitchell v. Trawler Racer, Inc., 362 U.S. 539, 550, 80 S.Ct. 926, 4 L.Ed.2d- 941 (1960); Grzybowski v. Arrow Barge Co., 283 F.2d 481, 484 (4 Cir. 1960); Ross v. Steamship Zeeland, 240 F.2d 820 (4 Cir. 1957). We find no such repetitive emphasis on the limitations to the standard of seaworthiness laid down by the Supreme Court as to create an imbalance in the charge. Ballwanz v. Isthmian Lines, Inc., 319 F.2d 457 (4 Cir. 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-5\">The court\u2019s charge concerning the possible interplay between the negligence of the stevedore, if any, and the nnseaworthiness of the equipment gave ample opportunity to the plaintiff to present all of his theories involving several combinations of the above factors.</p>\n<p id=\"b717-6\">We also agree with the court\u2019s conclusion that in the factual context of the \u2022 case a finding that the vessel was seaworthy obviated the possibility of negligence proximately causing the plaintiff\u2019s injury. \u201cSince unseaworthiness affords longshoremen recovery without fault and has been broadly construed by the courts, e. g., Mahnich v. So. S.S. Co. [321 U.S. 96, 64 S.Ct. 455, 88 L.Ed. 561], * * * it will be rare that the circumstances of an injury will constitute negligence but not unseaworthiness.\u201d Pope &amp; Talbot, Inc., v. Hawn, 346 U.S. 406, 418, 74 S.Ct. 202, 209, 98 L.Ed. 143 (1953) (concurring opinion of Justice Frankfurter).</p>\n<p id=\"b717-15\">We next come to the plaintiff's contention that the court erred in refusing to submit to the jury his claim of negligence and unseaworthiness predicated upon violation of the \u201cSafety and Health Regulations for Longshoring\u201d (29 C.F.R. \u00a7 9.1, et seq.) promulgated by the Secretary of Labor under the authority of Public Law 85-742, 72 Stat. 835, 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 941 et seq. The 1958 amendment to the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers' Compensation Act was Congress\u2019 effort \u201cto provide for establishing and enforcing an effective safety program in * * [the] hazardous occupation [of Long-shoring] * * <footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b717-16\">Plaintiff contends that the violation of these regulations<footnotemark>2</footnotemark>, no matter by whom <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"664\">*664</page-number>violated, ipso facto makes the shipowner liable either on the theory of negligence or unseaworthiness. He relies upon Kernan v. American Dredging Co., 355 U.S. 426, 78 S.Ct. 394, 2 L.Ed.2d 382 (1958). That action was an exoneration and limitation proceeding involving the death of a seaman who had lost his life in a fire on his employer\u2019s tug, which at the time was towing a scow on the Schuylkill River in Philadelphia. The accident occurred at night, and under the Coast Guard regulations applicable the scow was to carry a white navigation light not less than eight feet above the surface of the water. The purpose of this regulation was to prevent collisions. The regulation was not complied with by the shipowner, who, instead of carrying a light no less than eight feet above the surface carried an open flame lantern on the barge three feet above the water. Fumes arising from waste petroleum products floating on the surface of the water ignited and the scow and tug were enveloped in flames, which caused the decedent\u2019s death. The trial court found that there was no negligence in carrying.an open flame lantern on the barge three feet above the water, that since the danger encountered was not of the sort that the Coast Guard navigation regulation was designed to guard against, and since there was no negligence in having a light three feet above the surface, there could be no recovery under the Jones Act<footnotemark>3</footnotemark>. The Court of Appeals affirmed<footnotemark>4</footnotemark>. The Supreme Court reversed holding that recovery could be had under the Jones Act for the death which resulted from the violation of the statutory duty concerning lights even though there was no negligence in having the lantern three feet above the water and even though the character of the risk involved was not that which the statute was designed to guard against. In reaching this conclusion, the court relied on decisions under the Federal Employer\u2019s Liability Act, in which the court had held that recovery could be had for injuries resulting from the violation of the Safety Appliance Acts or the Boiler Inspection Act without regard to whether the injuries which flowed from the breach were the type the statute sought to prevent. Those principles developed under FELA were to be incorporated in construing the Jones Act, which grants to seamen the rights given to railroad employees under FELA.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"665\">*665</page-number>Kernan can be distinguished, as suggested by the defendants, because the regulation in that case applied to the shipowner, whereas here the regulations by their express terms apply only to the stevedore. Nevertheless, if the violation of the regulations by the stevedore created a dangerous condition then the law is clear that the shipowner is in turn also liable, even if he did not know of the dangerous situation created by the stevedore, for that is the nature of the owner\u2019s duty of seaworthiness. Pope &amp; Talbot, Inc. v. Hawn, 346 U.S. 406, 74 S.Ct. 202, 98 L.Ed. 143 (1953).</p>\n<p id=\"b719-5\">In Kernan the minority criticized the decision on the grounds that they saw no justification for applying the principles developed under FELA (absolute liability for violation of an \u201coff target\u201d regulation) to the violation of a Coast Guard regulation having no relationship to the cause of decedent\u2019s death. Such an argument may not be advanced here, since the regulation alleged to be violated related directly to the cause of plaintiff\u2019s injury.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-6\">We are unable to escape the conviction that it was error for the court not to read the regulations as requested and charge the jury that they were binding in law.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-7\">While the definition of seaworthiness laid down by the court<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> was correct as a general statement of law, we think the plaintiff was entitled to have put before the jury the definite standards set up in the regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Labor defining reasonably safe conditions in the exact area involved in this case. Furthermore, we are also forced to the conclusion that in the area covered by the regulations their violation would render the ship unseaworthy, and if such unseaworthiness was the proximate cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injury, it would also render the defendant shipowner liable. It follows, of course, that if the jury should find that the stevedore had violated the regulations such conduct could also constitute negligence. If in turn this negligent conduct of the stevedore were known, or by the exercise of reasonable care should have been known to the shipowner, and such negligence of the shipowner was a proximate cause of the plaintiff\u2019s injury, then he too would be liable to the plaintiff on the additional grounds of negligence.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-12\">Prior to the enactment of 33 U.S.C.A. \u00a7 941 and the promulgations of the regulations thereunder what constituted negligence or unseaworthiness was to be determined by the jury under the definitions laid down by the courts. Now, with respect to longshoring, the statute law of the United States has laid down definite standards, and we think the plaintiff longshoreman is entitled to have those standards applied to both the defendants in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-13\">The defendant insists that the regulation is entitled to no evidential value and that the judge was correct in declining to call attention to it in his charge to the jury. The basis for this is that the regulation declares that it is not intended to place additional responsibilities or duties on shipowners or to relieve them of responsibilities or duties. The argument has only a superficial plausibility and does not withstand analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b719-14\">The regulation casts upon the shipowner no new duty nor does it relieve him of any pre-existing duty. Now, as before the regulation was promulgated, it is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>incumbent on him to supply a seaworthy ship. Now, as before, if the ship becomes unseaworthy through the act of the stevedore or anyone else, and this condition is the proximate cause of an injury, the shipowner is liable. The legal duty is the same. All that the regulation does is to define how this well-established duty shall be discharged in particular circumstances by the stevedore who has undertaken to perform the shipowner\u2019s nondelegable duty: \u201cbeams shall be laid on their sides, or stood on edge close together and lashed\u201d. \u00a7 9.43(b). It prescribes a standard of safety, not a new duty. Nothing in the regulation forbids its being mentioned to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-4\">Of what possible use would a safety regulation be if its sanction is withdrawn by suppressing knowledge of it from the triers of fact? How can it be determined whether a condition complained of meets the standard of safety if the jury is kept in the dark as to what that standard is? To convert the provision which disavows an intent to add to or diminish the owner\u2019s duty into a direction to keep the safety provision secret is to make the entire regulation ineffective and meaningless. We cannot attribute to the draftsman any such fatuous and self-defeating design. The defendant\u2019s brief concedes that the purpose of the regulations was to make working conditions for longshoremen safer and thereby prevent accidents. We fail to see how it can possibly further this purpose to impose a rule of silence in respect to the regulations. We think the defendant\u2019s interpretation misreads the provision in question.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-5\">A more reasonable reading and one that observes both the language and the spirit is that <em>no new duty </em>is to be exacted where none existed before and, equally, <em>no existing duty </em>is to be excused by reason of the regulation; but the x-egulation\u2019s requirement may be considered by the trier of fact in determining whether its nonperformance has resulted in a failure to meet a duty incumbent upon the defendant \u2014 specifically in this instance whether an unseaworthy condition was created by leaving \u201cI beams\u201d loose on the deck where longshoremen were working. We so hold, for only such a reading avoids the incongruity contended for by the defendant and gives a rational effect to every part of the regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-7\">This still leaves ample scope to the language of section 9.2(b) under consideration. It is to be noted that the statute provides a criminal penalty of $100 to $3000 for each conviction of a willful violation of the safety regulations prescribed pursuant thereto. As we read the statute, it means that the owner (operator, agent or master) is not amenable to such criminal penalties for the stevedore\u2019s violations; but the owner\u2019s duty to provide a seaworthy ship remains unchanged. If the stevedore makes the ship unseaworthy by violating a prescribed safety regulation, the statute says nothing either to absolve the owner from liability or to foreclose reference to the regulation in an effort to show that the condition which the stevedore caused or permitted fell short of recognized safety standards. The owner\u2019s duty does not stem from the regulation, but the regulation may be shown just like other evidence to indicate that a certain practice is safe or unsafe. While such evidence is not conclusive, it is relevant. It would be equally available to a shipowner to defend against a claim of unseaworthiness by showing that, although a longshoreman had sustained injury, the stevedore\u2019s performance was not substandard and in fact complied with the prescribed regulations.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-8\">The judgment in favor of the shipowner is reversed, the third party claim against the stevedore is reinstated, and the case remanded for retrial.</p>\n<p id=\"b720-9\">Reversed and remanded.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b717-7\">. The House Report accompanying <em>the </em>1958 Amendment to the Longshoremen\u2019s and Harbor Workers\u2019 Compensation Act points out that stevedoring is the most hazardous of all industries which report their experience to the Bureau of Labor .Statistics, having an injury frequency rate of seven times that of manufacturing. (1958 U.S.Code and Cong.News, p. - 3843. Section 41 of the Act (33 U.S. 1-C.A. \u00a7 941(a)) reads:</p>\n<p id=\"b717-9\">\u201cEvery employer shall furnish and maintain employment and places of employment which shall be reasonably \u25a0safe for his employees in all employ\u2022ments covered by this chapter and shall \u25a0install, furnish, maintain, and use such \u25a0 devices and safeguards with particular \u25a0 reference to equipment used by and working conditions established by such \u25a0 employers as the Secretary may deter-mine by regulation or order to be reasonably necessary to protect the life, ; health, and safety of such employees, i and to render safe such employment and places of employment, and to prevent injury to his employees.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b717-18\">.

In defining unseaworthiness the court below said:</p>\n<p id=\"b719-9\">\u201cThe crucial consideration is whether the ship was in all respects pertaining to the injury reasonably fit to permit Provenza to perform his tasks aboard the ship with reasonable safety. What all this means is that the defendant, American Export Lines, owed to the plaintiff, Provenza, the duty to have the ship reasonably fit to permit him to do his work on board in the manner in which he intended to work, that is, with reasonable safety. This is true although Provenza was not employed by American Export and although other stevedores and not ship\u2019s personnel may have moved the beams and although other stevedores operated the gear, the winches furnished by the shipowner.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b720-10\">ALBERT V. BRYAN, Circuit Judge</author>\n<p id=\"AeQ\">(dissenting).</p>\n<p id=\"b720-11\">No error, it seems to me, can be found in the refusal of the trial court to submit to the jury the \u201cSafety and Health Regulations for Longshoring\u201d. In explicit language the regulations themselves exclude <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>\"this use of them. There is no ambiguity or contradiction in the exclusion, which is contained in \u00a7 9.2(b) in these words:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AqC\">\u201c(b) It is not the intent of the regulations of this part to place additional responsibilities or duties on owners, operators, agents or masters of vessels unless such persons are acting as employers, nor is it the intent of these regulations to relieve such owners, operators, agents or masters of vessels from responsibilities or duties now placed upon them by law, regulation or custom.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b721-5\">Its object is altogether plain: that the regulations should not be taken as adding to, subtracting from, or in any other way affecting the responsibilities of a \u2022ship, her owners or operators to one not in their employ. Intrusion into that area was studiedly avoided.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-6\">Yet, over the protest of the regulations themselves, the Court now applies them to place a duty on the defendant shipowner to a non-employee. Ordinarily, a breach of a regulation, it is true, may be evidence of a breach of the civil duty therein imposed, but certainly such proof cannot be adduced for this purpose when, as here, the regulations by their very terms affirmatively forbid the accordance of any such effect to them.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-7\">Argument that the regulations merely evidence standards of care and do not \u25a0create a duty is an over-nice distinction. The regulations were intended to, and \u25a0do, declare duties of an employer to a longshoreman. Their character does not \u25a0change when they are transplanted to the relationship of shipowner to non-employee. Even if there is no transfer of duty in this sense, there is obviously the creation of a duty upon the shipowner by the regulations, in that they establish a measure for determining whether the shipowner has met his general maritime and common law obligations. To fix criteria is to fix a duty.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-8\">The charge of the District Judge was, admittedly, fair and full. It embraced rules of care for the longshoreman equivalent to those demanded by the regulations. It laid upon the shipowner responsibility for any neglect by the stevedore of these safeguards. The trial judge would certainly have been at fault if he had instructed, as the majority now hold he must, that obedience of these rules should be measured by reference to safety measures promulgated by the Secretary of Labor but <em>from </em>which he deliberately excepted shipowners.</p>\n<p id=\"b721-10\">The exclusion cannot be erased by deriding it as \u201ca rule of silence\u201d. Nor are we free to adopt certain parts of the regulations and ignore others. I would affirm the judgment on review.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
