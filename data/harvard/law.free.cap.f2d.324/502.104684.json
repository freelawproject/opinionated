Federal juris\u25a0diction rests on diversity of citizenship. \u2019The facts are stated in detail in Judge Bonsai\u2019s opinion, reported in D.C., 220 F.Supp. 190. By way of introduction to \u2022the issue presented by the plaintiff\u2019s appeal it will suffice to say that plaintiff was a member of a union which had a collective bargaining agreement with the Railroad; that he caused the union to initiate proceedings pursuant to such agreement but instead of appealing to the System Board of Adjustment as required by the agreement, he brought action in the District Court. Judge Bonsai \u2022decided as a matter of law that he was precluded from doing so. Relevant authorities were cited. We have nothing to -add to his opinion except a decision of this court subsequently handed down which gives additional support for his conclusion. Satterfield v. The Pennsylvania Railroad Company, 323 F.2d 783 (2 Cir. 1963).</p>\n<p id=\"b557-7\">Judgment affirmed on opinion below.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
