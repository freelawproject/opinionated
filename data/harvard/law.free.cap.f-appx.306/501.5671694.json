After oral argument and careful record review, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-21\">I. Background</p>\n<p id=\"b524-22\">To resolve the issues on appeal, we first set forth both the procedural history and the trial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b524-23\">A. No Personal Tax Returns for 1998 through 2002</p>\n<p id=\"b524-24\">King was the president and majority shareholder of Civil Cadd Engineering, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>Inc. (Civil Cadd) and the president and sole shareholder of CCE Construction, Inc. (CCEC). King founded both companies.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-5\">King filed S-corporation tax returns, known as 1120Ss, with the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) for Civil Cadd and CCEC each year from 1998 to 2002. Because the S-eorporate tax returns passed the corporations\u2019 income or loss through to King personally, the returns showed that the corporations owed no taxes for years 1998 to 2002.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Barry Hechtman, King\u2019s accountant, prepared the corporate returns based on records King provided Hechtman. King signed the returns.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-6\">Although King filed S-corporate tax returns for 1998 to 2002, he initially did not file any personal tax returns for these years. When pressed by Hechtman, King told Hechtman that he had another accountant preparing his personal tax returns, even though at the time Hechtman was King\u2019s only accountant. The IRS began investigating King in 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-7\">B. IRS Investigation in March through April 2004</p>\n<p id=\"b525-8\">In March 2004, IRS criminal investigation agents visited King\u2019s home to discuss his personal and business tax information. The IRS agents served King with three grand jury subpoenas for the production of his companies\u2019 business records. King referred the agents to his attorney, Larry Handfield. The same day the agents interviewed King, other agents simultaneously interviewed King\u2019s accountant, Hechtman, and served him with a grand jury subpoena for the production of records used in preparing King\u2019s business and personal tax returns. These subpoenaed records were due by April 1,2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-12\">C. King\u2019s First and Second Returns in August 2004</p>\n<p id=\"b525-13\">Only after the IRS investigation began did King file personal returns for tax years 1998 to 2002. These returns (\u201cKing\u2019s first returns\u201d) were prepared by Hechtman and filed by King in August 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-14\">King\u2019s first returns indicated that King owed $88,887 in personal taxes for 1998, $50,218 for 1999, $36,647 for 2000, $29,703 for 2001, and $89,559 for 2002, for a total of $295,014. Hechtman treated both Civil Cadd and CCEC as S-corporations in preparing King\u2019s first returns, passing those corporations\u2019 income through to King in his personal capacity. King\u2019s first returns for 1998 to 2002 were introduced at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b525-15\">Later in August 2004, King hired Donald Cook, a new accountant, to \u201cstart[] from scratch\u201d with King\u2019s own records to prepare personal returns for tax years 1998 to 2002 (\u201cKing\u2019s second returns\u201d). King filed his second returns at various times between 2004 and 2005.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> King\u2019s second returns showed that King owed $50,398 for 1998, $45,165 for 1999, $131,611 for 2000, and $245,916 for 2001, for a total of $473,090. Like Hechtman, Cook treated both Civil Cadd and CCEC as S-corporations in preparing King\u2019s second returns, passing those corporations\u2019 income through to King in his personal capacity. King\u2019s second returns for 1998 to 2001 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"504\">*504</page-number>were introduced at trial. Cook also prepared a second return for year 2002, but it does not appear to be a part of the record at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-4\">D. Search Warrant in September 2004</p>\n<p id=\"b526-5\">On September 1, 2004, after failing to receive the subpoenaed records from King and Hechtman, IRS agents executed a consent search of King\u2019s office. The agents seized about 26 boxes of original records. After having those items copied, the agents returned them to King\u2019s office on September 15, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-6\">On February 11, 2005, Leonard Sands, King\u2019s other attorney, notified the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office that he represented King. Sands explained that (1) he was \u201cengaging a forensic accountant to assist me sort [sic] through King\u2019s financial situation\u201d and (2) King\u2019s behavior \u201c[d]uring the period under investigation\u201d did not warrant prosecution.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-7\">E. March 30, 2005 Conference</p>\n<p id=\"b526-8\">On March 30, 2005, King\u2019s two attorneys (Sands and Handfield) and two attorneys from the U.S. Department of Justice Tax Division met at Sands\u2019s request. The Tax Division attorneys told King\u2019s attorneys that they had recommended that King be prosecuted for tax evasion for the years 1998 to 2002. They also provided a copy of the IRS\u2019s computations of King\u2019s back taxes. King\u2019s attorneys informed the Tax Division attorneys that King had met with several IRS officers \u201cto still try and work the tax situation out.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b526-9\">On April 21, 2005, the Tax Division informed King\u2019s attorneys that the Tax Division had authorized prosecution against King and had transmitted the case to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office.</p>\n<p id=\"b526-13\">F. 2006 Indictment</p>\n<p id=\"b526-14\">On August 24, 2006, a federal grand jury indicted King. Counts I through IV of the indictment (one count for each year from 1999 to 2002) charged King with willfully attempting to evade paying his personal federal income tax for years 1999 through 2002 by (1) failing to make an income tax return on or before the applicable deadlines for those years, (2) failing to pay to the IRS said income tax, and (3) concealing and attempting to conceal his true and correct income through, among other things, paying personal expenses with corporate bank accounts, preparing and causing the preparation of business records that falsely and fraudulently overstated corporate expenses, and filing and causing the preparation and filing of a false and fraudulent U.S. Corporation Income Tax Return for the years 1999 through 2002, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7201<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. Counts V through VII of the indictment (one count for each year from 1999 to 2001) charged King with filing false returns by willfully representing on his U.S. Corporation Income Tax Returns for calendar years 1999 through 2001 an annual income for Civil Cadd that was substantially less than the amount he knew Civil Cadd to have earned, in violation of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7206(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b526-15\">On September 5, 2006, King pled not guilty. On September 6, the district court set King\u2019s jury trial to start 40 days later on October 16, 2006. Also on September <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"505\">*505</page-number>6, the district court issued a standing discovery order requiring the government to permit King to inspect and copy all discovery materials in its possession within 14 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-5\">G. SDO Response</p>\n<p id=\"b527-6\">On September 18, 2006, the government filed a response to the standing discovery order (\u201cSDO Response\u201d). The SDO Response explained that copies of the documents that the government intended to use at trial were placed on file at Xpedia Copy Service. Because King claims on appeal that he did not have adequate time to copy and review these documents, we outline what those documents were.</p>\n<p id=\"b527-7\">Paragraph 5 of the government\u2019s SDO Response advises generally what documents were at Xpedia as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b527-8\">Copies of books, papers, documents, photographs, tangible objects, and other items of \u201creal\u201d evidence not already returned to the defendant which the government intends to use as evidence at trial to prove its case in chief, or were obtained or belonging to the defendant have been placed on file with Xpedia Copy Service.... A detailed listing of the contents of the fifteen bankers boxes of materials on file with Xpedia is attached to this response as Atch C. Additionally, an eleven page listing of items originally seized via search warrant from Civil Cadd\u2019s office is also attached to this response as Atch D. With respect to this eleven page list, copies of these materials are NOT on file with Xpedia. All of the original materials were returned to the defendant by the IRS. They are already in his (and his company\u2019s) possession. Copies of those documents were retained by the IRS. Please advise the undersigned if you deem it necessary to review those copies.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b527-12\">Because there were 15 boxes worth of materials, Attachment C to the SDO Response identified them by box number with a description of the contents and bates numbers.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> It appears that at least 29,000 documents were in the boxes referenced in Attachment C. Sands obtained a cost estimate from Xpedia for copying which refers to 29,000 documents and calls it the \u201c1st Part of Production.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b527-13\">Attachment D to the SDO Response identified the documents that the government seized from Civil Cadd\u2019s office in the September 2004 search. Attachment D described those documents by the location where they were found in Civil Cadd\u2019s office, the evidence box in which they were stored, and the type of documents in each box.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The SDO Response noted that the documents in Attachment D were not on <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"506\">*506</page-number>file with Xpedia, but they in fact were. Sands also obtained a separate, second cost estimate that refers to 50,000 documents in \u201c26 boxes\u201d and calls it the \u201c2nd Part of Production.\u201d Although the government had returned the originals to King in 2004, the government placed its copies on file with Xpedia.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b528-4\">H. King\u2019s First Continuance Motion</p>\n<p id=\"b528-5\">On September 29, 2006, King filed both an unopposed motion to continue the trial date until May or June 2007 and an unopposed motion for additional time to file defense motions. King stressed that this was a paper-intensive criminal tax case under investigation for four years and Xpedia was holding 39 boxes totaling 80,-000 documents as discovery. Moreover, King wanted one or more forensic accountants to review and analyze the records. The review would take \u201cseveral months at the very least.\u201d On October 4, 2006, the district court summarily denied both motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-6\">I. The October 10, 2006 Exhibit List</p>\n<p id=\"b528-7\">On October 10, 2006, the government faxed King its trial exhibit list that identified 170 documents (which comprised nearly all of the government\u2019s exhibits at trial) and a draft proposed stipulation for King\u2019s business records. The October 10 Exhibit List identified each exhibit by its description and by the witness that would introduce each exhibit. For example, the list described Exhibit 173, which corresponded with witness Donald Cook, as \u201cCivil Cadd 1999 financial statements, 1120S for 1999 Civil Cadd, 1120S for 1999 CCEC, and King 1999 1040 Tax return.\u201d Similarly, the list described Exhibit 102 as \u201c2002 Blais Cycle invoices\u201d and stated that this exhibit would be presented through Kevin Blais, the owner of Blais Cycle, Inc. The government delivered copies of each marked trial exhibit to King\u2019s attorney on October 13, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-10\">J. King\u2019s Second Continuance Motion</p>\n<p id=\"b528-11\">On October 11, 2006, King renewed his motion to continue the October 16 trial and waived his speedy trial rights. Because there were only six weeks between indictment and trial and only four weeks between the government\u2019s September 18 discovery response and the October 16 trial, King argued that preparing a complex case was not possible, regardless of the capabilities and diligence of counsel. King reiterated that he had \u201cnot received \u2014 let alone reviewed \u2014 the enormous volume of discovery in [the] case.\u201d King\u2019s October 11 motion also noted that his counsel had scheduling conflicts. The district court granted King a trial continuance until October 24, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b528-12\">On October 17, 2006, King supplemented his two unopposed motions to continue the trial. King asserted that the indictment failed to allege the exact amounts of unreported income and the taxes owed. King noted that he received the government\u2019s discovery response on September 19. As of October 17, only 28,901 documents (out of 80,000) had been copied. King stated that he needed 10 to 14 more days to copy <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"507\">*507</page-number>the remaining 26 boxes of material.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Additionally, King noted that he had received copies of the government\u2019s 170 trial exhibits just four days ago. King\u2019s forensic accountant had not had time to review and digest the discovery, and therefore could not determine which of the 80,000 documents would be of value to the defense. Finally, King argued that the time taken by the government to investigate the case should not be charged to him, regardless of whether King knew the government was considering criminal charges.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-5\">The district court again denied King\u2019s motions, finding that \u201c[o]n September 6, 2006, this case was set on the October 16, 2006, trial docket, allowing a full 40 days (or more than 5 weeks of preparation time), to engage in discovery, file pretrial motions and otherwise conduct those matters set forth in Defendant\u2019s motion for continuance.\u201d In an apparent reference to the materials seized from, and returned to, King\u2019s office two years earlier in September 2004, the court noted that much of the documentary evidence the government relied on had been returned to King. It found that King had \u201cample time to examine and review the remaining evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b529-6\">K. The October 23, 2006 Revised Exhibit List</p>\n<p id=\"b529-7\">On October 23, 2006, the day before trial, the government provided King with a revised trial exhibit list and attached copies of all of the prospective government exhibits (other than transcripts of grand jury testimony of prospective witnesses that the government did not anticipate offering into evidence). The government\u2019s accompanying cover letter explained that the revisions to the list were revisions of form \u2014 not substance. The cover letter stated that the \u201cvast majority\u201d of marked exhibits were copies of exhibits already provided with the October 10 Exhibit List. A review of the two exhibit lists shows that the government added approximately 25 exhibits (including summary charts and photos of vehicles) and substituted approximately 10 exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-11\">L. Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b529-12\">King\u2019s trial commenced on October 24, 2006, and lasted until November 1, 2006. At the start of the trial, King\u2019s counsel moved for a continuance, explaining, \u201cI have never felt so inadequate and unprepared for a major case like I do.... For all practical purposes we have had about a month to get ready.... [Tjhis case was under investigation for a long time, but we had reason to believe that the case had gone away.\u201d He further stated, \u201cThese cases ordinarily take eight months to a year to get worked up, not 30 to 40 days____\u201d The court orally denied the motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b529-14\">In its case-in-chief, the government called approximately 30 witnesses and introduced approximately 170 exhibits. These witnesses included: accountant Hechtman, who prepared King\u2019s first returns; accountant Cook, who prepared King\u2019s second returns; and Joan Leavitt, an IRS forensic accountant.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b530-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"508\">*508</page-number>Hechtman, who prepared King\u2019s corporate tax returns from 1998 to 2002, testified that King failed to file any personal income tax returns from 1998 to 2002. Hechtman did not prepare or file any personal income tax returns on King\u2019s behalf from 1998 to 2002 because King told him that \u201che had another accountant doing his personal tax returns.\u201d Hechtman stated that, in August 2004, after he and King\u2019s office manager were subpoenaed to testify before a federal grand jury, King asked Hechtman to file King\u2019s first returns for 1998 to 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-4\">Hechtman used financial statements and ledgers provided by King to construct these personal tax returns. King ultimately reviewed and approved all of Hechtman\u2019s entries before filing the returns. As noted earlier, King\u2019s first returns for 1998 through 2002 showed King owed $295,014. Hechtman testified that when the IRS started the investigation, King \u201cdecided to make changes to [his previously filed S-corporate] tax returns\u201d and asked Hechtman to file his personal returns for 1998 through 2002. Hechtman also testified that, despite being warned by Hechtman of the impropriety of such activities, King commingled personal and business funds, labeled certain business assets and activities deceptively, and underreported his businesses\u2019 income.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b530-5\">The government also called Cook, King\u2019s accountant, who detailed each entry in King\u2019s second returns. Cook stated that he used \u201ccheck stubs[,] ... bank statements^] and cancelled checks\u201d to compile the second returns. King\u2019s second returns for 1998 through 2001 showed King owed $473,090. Cook reaffirmed that his ealculations were accurate and that he asked King to review them before filing.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-8\">After Cook described King\u2019s second returns figure-by-figure, he explained that King had not actually filed any individual tax returns from 1998 to 2002 because \u201che just hadn\u2019t gotten around to it.\u201d When Cook showed King that he owed hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxes, King did not appear surprised. Cook \u201cassumed [King] knew how much money he was making, so [Cook] assumed he knew how much tax liability he had.\u201d The government attorney asked Cook about the motorcycle purchases. Cook stated that he charged those expenses to King personally rather than to King\u2019s businesses.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-9\">During cross-examination by Sands, Cook explained that King was not worried about not having filed tax returns for 1998 to 2002 because \u201che had done it before and he didn\u2019t see what the big deal [was].\u201d Cook also explained that King had told him that both Civil Cadd and CCEC were S-corporations. As noted earlier, King\u2019s first and second returns treated both companies as S-corporations.</p>\n<p id=\"b530-10\">Leavitt, the IRS accountant, also testified about her detailed examination of King\u2019s financial records. Leavitt testified that King\u2019s inappropriate corporate ledger entries reduced Civil Cadd\u2019s ordinary income, and thereby reduced King\u2019s personal income that passed through Civil Cadd to him. She described several other inappropriate practices of King, such as: depositing payments from Civil Cadd customers into his personal accounts; having company checks written to an employee and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"509\">*509</page-number>demanding the employee immediately provide the cash back to King for his personal use; and commingling personal and corporate funds. Leavitt detected in King\u2019s bank records what appeared to be \u201cstructured transactions\u201d: attempts to evade currency transaction reports by cashing checks in the amount of $9,500 on a consecutive series of days. King\u2019s lawyer also cross-examined Leavitt about the subchapter S/C issue and then noted that, according to King\u2019s second returns, King had \u201cself-reported\u201d a greater tax liability for the tax years in question than Leavitt had calculated.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-5\">After the government rested, King moved for a mistrial, asserting that he had been denied the necessary processes of obtaining discovery, having an accountant review the discovery materials, and meeting with the government attorney to focus the issues and ask questions. King argued that the absence of these processes limited his ability to examine the government\u2019s experts. The court denied King\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-6\">King then called two witnesses who focused on King\u2019s lack of sophistication in accounting and economic matters. Of the 1,553 page transcript from the jury trial, 58 pages consist of King presenting his case.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-7\">The jury found King (1) guilty on three counts \u2014 the evasion of personal taxes for years 1999, 2001, and 2002 and (2) not guilty on four counts \u2014 the evasion of personal taxes for year 2000 and the filing of false corporate tax returns for years 1999 through 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-8\">M. Post-Trial Motions</p>\n<p id=\"b531-9\">Following the verdict, King renewed his motion for judgment of acquittal and/or for a new trial. King argued that his counsel had insufficient time to prepare for trial in light of the volume of discovery, and that he was effectively denied the services of a forensic accountant due to the limited time between his August 24 indictment and October 24 trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-12\">The government\u2019s response argued that King was unable to meet his burden of establishing that he suffered \u201cspecific, substantial prejudice\u201d because of the court\u2019s continuance denials. The government pointed out that since March 2005, King was aware that he failed to pay his taxes during the relevant tax years, knew how much he owed, and was aware of the IRS\u2019s computations of King\u2019s tax liabilities. According to the government, King had no plausible basis for claiming that a forensic accountant could impeach the IRS\u2019s computations or the evidence underlying the government\u2019s case. In addition to the IRS\u2019s computations, King\u2019s amended tax returns prepared in 2004 (i.e., King\u2019s second returns) showed gross underpayments and established tax deficiencies greater than those calculated by the government.</p>\n<p id=\"b531-13\">The government attached several exhibits to its response. For example, the government attached a memorandum from the March 30, 2005 conference between the Tax Division and King\u2019s attorneys.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> The memorandum stated that King\u2019s attorneys were informed that \u201cthe purpose of the conference [was] to provide the taxpayer with the opportunity to present explanations and evidence through his representatives that might assist the Government in reaching a decision regarding prosecution.\u201d The IRS recommended that King be prosecuted for evading taxes for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"510\">*510</page-number>years 1998 through 2002. King\u2019s attorneys were informed that the IRS used the specific items method of proof. They were-provided with a copy of the IRS\u2019s computations of King\u2019s tax deficiencies.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-4\">The government also attached: (1) an April 21, 2005, letter from the Justice Department\u2019s Tax Division to King\u2019s attorneys that notified them of its decision to authorize prosecution against King; (2) an October 10, 2006, fax from the U.S. Department of Justice that provided King\u2019s attorneys with the government trial exhibit list; and (3) an October 23, 2006, letter stating that the government had enclosed a complete copy set of its trial exhibits and a copy of its revised exhibit list.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-5\">The district court denied King\u2019s motion for a judgment of acquittal and/or a new trial. King filed a motion for reconsideration, which the court also denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-6\">N. Presentence Investigation Report</p>\n<p id=\"b532-7\">According to the presentence investigation report (\u201cPSI\u201d), King received substantial income between 1998 and 2002, but failed to timely file personal income tax returns or to pay income tax to the IRS for those years. The PSI indicated that King\u2019s personal income \u201ctax due and owing\u201d was $562,649, consisting of: (1) $50,398 for 1998; (2) $45,165 for 1999; (3) $131,611 for 2000; (4) $245,916 for 2001; and (5) $89,559 for 2002.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> Because the loss amount was greater than $400,000 but not more than $1,000,000, the PSI calculated King\u2019s base offense level as 20 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Tl.l(a)(l) and \u00a7 2T4.1 (Tax Table). A 2-level enhancement applied under \u00a7 2Tl.l(b)(2) because the offense involved sophisticated means, yielding a total offense level of 22. Based on King\u2019s offense level of 22 and criminal history I, his advisory guideline range was 41 to 51 months\u2019 imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-13\">The PSI also detailed some of King\u2019s conduct. For example, the PSI stated that King used Civil Cadd funds to pay for his personal expenses and that he claimed these personal expenses as Civil Cadd business expenses. King deposited Civil Cadd checks and transferred Civil Cadd funds into his personal account. He diverted Civil Cadd\u2019s receipts into his personal accounts and did not report these monies as Civil Cadd income. According to the PSI, King made payments from Civil Cadd\u2019s bank account to his mortgage company and to Blais Cycle, Cycle Race Tek, Inc., and Motoport USA, Inc., for the purchase and repair of motorcycles and automobiles. King also made payments from Civil Cadd\u2019s account to Morningstar Jewelers and Pawn Brokers, Pools by Andrew, and Ed Morse Cadillac of Pembroke.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-14\">The PSI found that because King deposited Civil Cadd\u2019s and CCEC\u2019s funds into his personal account without notifying his accountant, the funds were not included as King\u2019s ordinary income. King also caused his accountant to prepare false tax returns by not including as income numerous checks from Civil Cadd clients totaling $196,729.10.</p>\n<p id=\"b532-15\">King, still acting through his trial counsel Sands, filed objections to the PSI. First, King claimed that the PSI should have used the Tax Table in the 1998 Sentencing Guidelines manual and not the 2001 amended Tax Table in the 2006 manual. Second, King objected to the enhancement for sophisticated means, arguing that he personally never made a single accounting entry and that trial witnesses testified about his lack of sophistication as <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"511\">*511</page-number>to accounting and taxes. Third, King objected to the amount of tax loss attributed to him. King asserted that the PSI improperly included the tax loss for 1998, a year that was beyond the statute of limitations and for which King was not prosecuted, and for 2000, a year for which the jury found him not guilty of tax evasion. Excluding 1998 and 2000, his total tax loss (for 1999, 2000, and 2002) was less than or equal to $880,640.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-5\">Fourth, King\u2019s objections argued that the short amount of time provided to review King\u2019s tax situation \u201cmade any attempt to go behind the government\u2019s computations virtually impossible except in the most superficial of ways.\u201d King attached to his PSI objections a January 2, 2007 letter from Russell Dunn, his third accountant. Dunn\u2019s letter indicated that he began discussing the government\u2019s calculations of King\u2019s tax underpayments in late August or early September 2006. Dunn noted that he had visited Xpedia with Sands on October 17, 2006, and that, in light of \u201cthe approximately seventy-four thousand (74,000) pages of paper,\u201d he \u201cwould need a minimum of six to nine months to fully examine all of the documents and make a determination as to the propriety of the government\u2019s claims against Mr. King.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b533-6\">Although Dunn\u2019s letter pointed out some \u201cpotential problems\u201d with the IRS\u2019s computations, his letter also stated: \u201cI cannot give my opinion of the propriety of the government\u2019s adjustments to net income at this time.\u201d For example, as to the 1999 tax year, Dunn\u2019s letter noted that there \u201cappears to be an inconsistency in the government\u2019s computation.\u201d Dunn\u2019s letter asserted that the government made a reduction in King\u2019s shareholder loan account in Civil Cadd for 1999 without making a corresponding reduction in King\u2019s income for 1999. Dunn\u2019s letter, however, admitted that he \u201cha[d] not had the opportunity to determine the propriety of the government\u2019s proposed adjustment to loans from shareholder [King] due to time constraints.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b533-11\">Similarly, Dunn\u2019s letter acknowledged that King\u2019s first and second returns in 2004 showed tax underpayment totaling $562,649 for tax years 1998 to 2002, as stated in the PSI. Dunn\u2019s letter noted that, subsequent to the filing of those returns, \u201cthe IRS notified Mr. King that CCE[C] was not an S-corporation.\u201d Dunn\u2019s letter estimated that the effect of removing CCEC\u2019s income from King\u2019s personal income would reduce King\u2019s personal income taxes for 1999 to 2001 by $149,265 and that King would owe $362,986 instead of $562,649.</p>\n<p id=\"b533-12\">Beyond that reduction, Dunn\u2019s letter stated \u201cit has come to my attention that Donald Cook has prepared amended tax returns for the corporate entities as well as John King\u2019s 1040s for 2000, 2001, and 2002. These amended 1040s indicate that John King does not have <em>any </em>tax due and owing.\u201d At some point in 2006, Cook apparently prepared a third set of personal tax returns for King. However, there is no indication that King\u2019s third returns were introduced at trial in 2006 or even at the sentencing hearing in 2007. Moreover, Dunn\u2019s letter continues that \u201c[he] ha[d] not had an opportunity to examine the tax returns, interview Mr. Cook, nor examine the underlying supporting documentation to determine the validity of [King\u2019s third] returns.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b534-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"512\">*512</page-number>Dunn\u2019s letter concluded that \u201cadditional time [was] necessary to form [his] opinion regarding Mr. King\u2019s tax liabilities. There are too many conflicts at this time between the government\u2019s analysis of his tax obligation and those of Mr. King\u2019s current and former accountants. The substantially correct amount of tax is currently an elusive concept.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">O. Sentencing Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">At the sentencing hearing on January 30, 2007, King, for the first time acting through his current attorney, Roderick Vareen, renewed his objection to the court\u2019s denial of his continuance motions. King again listed the reasons for his objection, including his counsel\u2019s unpreparedness to cross-examine witnesses, as \u201cthey did not have the evidence that the government had beforehand.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">King also noted that the government\u2019s opening statement at trial referenced King\u2019s use of corporate assets to purchase motorcycles. However, since trial, King had provided counsel with documents showing that \u201cloans [ ] he took out through Colonial Bank [ ] show that he collateralized a 1962 Chevrolet Corvette in order to get substantial dollars to purchase motorcycles.\u201d That information did not come out at trial, however, because:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b534-7\">[T]his was something that was buried in flies that the defense were not aware that they were going to have to challenge at that time.... [T]hey could not meet the challenge that the government put forth in its evidence with regard to the five hundred some odd documents that were not spelled out essentially until the time of trial that they had to meet.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">Further, King asserted that it was not possible for his counsel to go through the 39 boxes of discovery material without help, and Dunn did not have sufficient time \u201ceven to address the issues spelled out in the PSI.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-10\">The government replied that because King and his counsel were involved with the IRS in 2005 and 2006 regarding payroll tax issues, King\u2019s attorneys \u201cwere given complete information regarding what the IRS [was] investigating criminally. To say they were caught by surprise in this case is simply not credible.\u201d King responded that the government informed him that, if he was going to be indicted, it would occur in March of 2006. When' that did not occur, he \u201cdidn\u2019t have any reason to believe ... that an indictment was still being sought for Mr. King\u2019s arrest on these charges.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b534-11\">The district court allowed King and the government to present witnesses about the continuance issue for the record on appeal. The government presented Lashell Williams, a revenue officer with the IRS. Williams collects delinquent income and employment taxes. Williams testified that the Civil Cadd collection was assigned to her in November 2006 but that IRS agents were in contact with Sands, King\u2019s attorney, beginning in October 2005 and with Dunn, King\u2019s accountant, beginning in January 2006.<footnotemark>14</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b534-12\">King presented no witnesses at sentencing. Instead, Sands spoke briefly about King\u2019s involvement with the IRS. Sands argued that it was unfair to consider King\u2019s initial meeting with the IRS in 2005 a \u201cmeeting\u201d because it occurred two years before the indictment and because King \u201cdid not know specifics\u201d and \u201cdid not have books and records.\u201d Sands claimed that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"513\">*513</page-number>all \u201c[the IRS] will tell you in those meetings and they are very careful not to disclose too much of them case is what they believe the prosecution years are, what the method of prosecution is going to be.\u201d Sands concluded by stating that because \u201c[t]here was such a long hiatus [between this first meeting and King\u2019s indictment,] ... we had foolishly convinced ourselves there was no case.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b535-5\">Also at sentencing, King renewed his objections to the PSI. Sands argued that the court should not rely on the 2006 Sentencing Guidelines manual because King\u2019s criminal conduct occurred from 1999 through 2001, the applicable Tax Tables changed in 2001, and the 2006 manual applied the 2001 Tax Table amendment, which punished King more stringently, thereby violating the Ex Post Facto clause. The court overruled King\u2019s objections, noting that he was convicted for the personal tax return due in 2002, the year after the applicable Tax Table was amended in 2001.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-6\">King next objected to the amount of loss and use of the Tax Table, arguing that Counts I, III, and IV did not specify a tax loss amount for which King was responsible, and thus the jury did not decide the tax loss amount. King argued that the court should apply a base offense level of six, under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2T4.1(b), and not enhance his offense level based on a tax loss amount of over $400,000. The court found that, regardless of the jury\u2019s verdict, it could include uncharged and acquitted conduct if it was satisfied that a preponderance of the evidence supported the PSI\u2019s calculations of the probation officer. The court noted that the PSI reflected tax liabilities of $562,649, \u201cs[o] just on the basis of the returns which essentially [King] filed himself, he has established he is in excess of the $400,000 base by $162,649.\u201d The court overruled King\u2019s objection, finding that a preponderance of the evidence showed the amount of taxes due exceeded $400,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-8\">Next, King objected to the two-level enhancement for sophisticated means. He argued that, at most, the government showed he commingled his personal and corporate funds. King did not create a fictitious corporation, maintain offshore accounts, reroute money, or create fictitious employees. Essentially, the government accused him of bad bookkeeping. The court overruled the objection, finding that King had \u201cused his company\u2019s shareholder loan account to conceal income or to hide income,\u201d classified vendor checks as loans, classified personal expenses as corporate expenses, and had an employee cash business checks and provide him personally with cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-9\">The court adopted the PSI calculations and sentenced King to a term of 41 months\u2019 imprisonment on each of the three counts of conviction, to run concurrently, followed by three years of supervised release, and a fine of $10,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-10\">II. Continuance Motions</p>\n<p id=\"b535-11\">We first address King\u2019s claim that the district court abused its discretion by denying his motions for continuance.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-12\">A. Circuit Precedents</p>\n<p id=\"b535-13\">\u201cThe Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantee that any person brought to trial in any state or federal court must be afforded the right to assistance of counsel before he or she can be validly convicted and punished by imprisonment.\u201d <em>United States v. Verderame, </em>51 F.3d 249, 251 (11th Cir.1995). \u201cImplicit in th[e] right to counsel is the notion of adequate time for counsel to prepare the defense....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 252. Whether a denial of a continuance motion amounts to a violation of due process depends on the circum<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"514\">*514</page-number>stances of the particular case. <em>Id. </em>at 251 (stating that \u201c[t]here are no mechanical tests\u201d for making the determination (quotation marks omitted)). \u201cTo prevail on such a claim, a defendant must show that the denial of the motion for continuance was an abuse of discretion which resulted in specific substantial prejudice.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">We have applied these principles on several occasions. <em>United States v. Valladares, </em>544 F.3d 1257, 1265 (11th Cir.2008); <em>Verderame, </em>51 F.3d 249; <em>United States v. Gossett, </em>877 F.2d 901 (11th Cir.1989). We review each case.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">In <em>Gossett, </em>we concluded that the defendants failed to show the \u201cspecific, substantial prejudice\u201d required to obtain relief. 877 F.2d at 906. Both defendants were convicted of murdering a ship\u2019s captain, attempted murder of his first mate, and mutiny. <em>Id. </em>at 903. The original six-count indictment was returned on August 28, 1987, and the trial was set for November 9. <em>Id. </em>at 905. On October 29, the grand jury returned a superceding indictment, which dropped two of the original charges and added a felony murder charge. <em>Id. </em>Upon the government and defendants\u2019 joint motion, the district court granted a continuance until November 23. The issue was whether the court abused its discretion in not granting the extra seven days until November 30 as requested by the parties. <em>Id. </em>at 906.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">The defendants in <em>Gossett </em>claimed that, \u201cdue to the changes in the superceding indictment,\u201d they \u201chad inadequate time to prepare for trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 906. In concluding that defendants failed to show \u201cspecific, substantial prejudice,\u201d this Court stated that the defendants \u201csuggested nothing to this Court, nor can we find anything in the record that would indicate the possibility of a different outcome if the defendants had been given an additional seven days to prepare for trial.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b536-10\">In <em>Verderame, </em>however, we concluded that the district court abused its discretion in repeatedly denying Verderame\u2019s unopposed motions for a continuance. 51 F.3d at 250. The government charged Verderame with participation in two separate conspiracies to import and distribute cocaine and marijuana and with criminal forfeiture. <em>Id. </em>On May 13, Verderame filed an unopposed motion for a continuance of his June 3 trial,<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> which the court denied. <em>Id. </em>On May 26, the government filed a bill of particulars listing for the first time the items subject to forfeiture (including Verderame\u2019s home, business, liquor license, and other personal property items). <em>Id. </em>Verderame filed two more continuance motions, arguing his counsel had inadequate time to prepare a defense and had not received copies of all relevant documents. <em>Id. </em>at 250-51. On June 3, the district court denied the motions. <em>Id. </em>at 251. The government then dismissed the cocaine conspiracy charge, but on the first day of trial (June 7) filed a second bill of particulars adding $2.4 million in cash to the list of forfeitable property. <em>Id. </em>At trial, \u201c[t]he bulk of the evidence which the government presented against Verderame consisted of the testimony of an internal revenue agent who had analyzed Verderame\u2019s financial records.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The analyst testified that Verderame spent more between 1988 and 1992 than he listed as income on his tax returns for those years, indicating Verderame derived income from illegal activities. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b536-11\">In reversing Verderame\u2019s conviction, we concluded that the 34 days between arraignment and trial failed to provide ample time to defend against \u201ca case which the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>government spent years investigating, ... which grew during the 34-day interval to encompass further property subject to forfeiture, ... which abruptly shifted focus away from the cocaine conspiracy a mere four days before trial.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 252. We also noted that the 34 days did not provide the government sufficient time to supply Verderame with the documents it had seized and to which he was entitled. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b537-5\">Finally, in <em>Valladares, </em>we concluded that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the defendant\u2019s unopposed motions to continue her trial because Valladares failed to show that \u201cspecific, substantial prejudice\u201d resulted from those denials. 544 F.3d at 1265. Indicted for participating in a Medicare fraud scheme, Valladares had 34 days between her arraignment and trial to plan her defense. <em>Id. </em>at 1261, 1264.<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> Because \u2018Valladares ha[d] not pointed to any specific documents or relevant, non-cumulative evidence she would have presented, nor ha[d] we found anything in the record that would indicate a different result had the motions been granted,\u201d we affirmed Valladares\u2019s three convictions. <em>Id. </em>at 1264 (quotation marks omitted). We distinguished a case like this from <em>Verderame, </em>\u201cwhere the government\u2019s case was based primarily on an IRS agent\u2019s testimony about the defendant\u2019s financial records and defense counsel argued that there were specific financial records that he needed to refute the agent\u2019s testimony but did not have time to obtain and review before the trial began.\u201d <em>Id. </em>We also noted that, \u201cin light of the extensive testimony by the pharmacy owners and two Medicare beneficiaries implicating Valladares in the Medicare fraud scheme, it is unlikely that presentation of these records [the government delayed producing or had not produced] would have changed the outcome of her case.\u201d <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>17</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">B. King\u2019s Continuance Motions</p>\n<p id=\"b537-9\">Here, 61 days separated King\u2019s indictment (August 24) and trial (October 24) in this relatively complicated tax evasion case. King\u2019s counsel moved for a continuance on three different occasions, each time explaining why he could not be prepared for the impending trial. The court granted King only an eight-day continuance (from October 16 until October 24) and denied his other requests. At the start of trial, King\u2019s counsel orally renewed his continuance motion, which the court also denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-10\">The difficulty in trial preparation was exacerbated by the fact that, little more than a month before trial, the government left 39 boxes containing 80,000 discovery <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>documents at Xpedia, a copy center. Although the government gave King its list of 170 exhibits two weeks before trial and copies of each exhibit 11 days before trial, King did not receive the revised exhibit list until the day before trial. Admittedly, the majority of the documents at Xpedia were copies of King\u2019s own documents and were itemized in the government\u2019s Attachments C and D. Nonetheless, this is a complicated tax fraud case involving voluminous records. King\u2019s request for more time to prepare was reasonable. While we understand the need to move cases expeditiously, this case was not a simple one. A 30- or 60-day continuance, for example, would not have unduly delayed the court\u2019s docket under these facts.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-4\">The problem for King, however, is that he has not shown that the district court\u2019s denials resulted in \u201cspecific, substantial prejudice\u201d to his defense, as required by our precedents. King\u2019s brief argues generally that he did not have sufficient time to fully develop a defense to the charges, to find and prepare his own witnesses, to effectively cross-examine the government\u2019s witnesses, or to rebut the government\u2019s case. King also claims that Dunn, his forensic accountant, did not have adequate time to review the government\u2019s calculations and exhibits.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-5\">However, King has not identified what new, specific information he would have presented to the jury with more preparation time, much less how that new information possibly would have affected the outcome in his case. Simply put, King\u2019s claims are primarily general allegations of a lack of time to prepare unaccompanied by a description of how more time would have changed the end result. King fails to name a single new witness, other than Dunn, he would have called if given more time to prepare. And, two years later, he does not point to a single question he would ask differently on cross-examination. Indeed, Dunn, his third accountant, admits in his January 2, 2007, letter that he cannot give any opinions about the amount of taxes owed by King. In fact, a total of five months elapsed from the indictment in August 24, 2006, until the sentencing on January 30, 2007, yet King still did not have an accountant develop any new information that would support a possibility of a different result. King has no accountant or evidence that would impeach his own two filed and signed tax returns, much less the government\u2019s calculations of his tax liabilities. At a minimum, King could have had an accountant in that five-month period take one of the tax years and prepare a computation of what King contends he actually owed. He never did.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-12\">The closest King gets to specifics are his allegations that he discovered post-trial (1) that CCEC is a C-corporation (and not an S-corporation) and (2) loan documents for some of his motorcycle purchases. Neither allegation helps King. First, at trial, both King\u2019s lawyer (Sands) and King\u2019s accountant (Cook) acknowledged knowing about the question regarding the corporate status of CCEC. Sands\u2019s cross-examinations of Hechtman, Cook, and Leavitt at trial indicate that King was aware of, and had the opportunity to fully cross-examine witnesses about, the subchapter S/C-corporation issue during trial.<footnotemark>18</footnotemark> All knew that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>the government\u2019s calculations, and even King\u2019s first and second returns, treated CCEC as an S-corporation that passed its income through to King. King\u2019s ignorance of CCEC\u2019s corporate status \u2014 an entity that he owns \u2014 cannot be blamed on the lack of time to prepare for trial.<footnotemark>19</footnotemark> Moreover, even if the income from CCEC was not passed through to King, Dunn\u2019s calculations, eliminating that pass through, show that King still owed $362,986 in personal taxes.<footnotemark>20</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b539-5\">In any event, at sentencing, the district court rejected the argument that CCEC should be treated as a C-corporation, not an S-corporation, and that King owed less or no taxes. King\u2019s own accountants, Hechtman and Cook, had prepared King\u2019s first and second returns, both treating CCEC as an S-corporation. Further, each return shows that King owed substantial personal taxes ($295,014 according to King\u2019s first returns and $473,000 according to King\u2019s second returns). Given that the jury also had King\u2019s first and second returns in evidence, King has not shown a possibility of a different result as to his convictions for the evasion of personal income taxes.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-18\">As to the motorcycle purchases, King was on actual notice that the government was going to rely on specific motorcycle purchase records. The October 10 Exhibit List, served on King\u2019s attorneys, specifically informed King that company checks that he used to pay for personal motorcycle purchases (Civil Cadd checks to Blais Cycles, Motoport USA, and Cycle Race Tek), as well as copies of the invoices he had been issued from Blais Cycle, Cycle Race Tek, and Motoport USA, would be introduced at trial. These checks supple-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>merited the government\u2019s earlier disclosure of the copies of King\u2019s Wachovia Bank and Colonial Bank records in its SDO Response. The government\u2019s draft of proposed stipulations also specifically refers to the records of the motorcycle purchases as government trial exhibits. The government delivered copies of each marked exhibit to King\u2019s attorney on October 13, 2006. King had time before the October 24 trial date to investigate this discrete set of his records. In any event, King\u2019s motorcycle purchases were but a single example of King\u2019s large-scale financial manipulations designed to hide his personal income, as established at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">This leads us to the final point. The trial evidence overwhelmingly showed that King had evaded paying personal income taxes in 1999, 2001, and 2002. King falsely told his original accountant Hechtman that another accountant was filing his returns for 1999 through 2002 and that Hechtman need not prepare them. Only after the IRS began its investigation and searched his office did King have Hechtman and his second accountant, Cook, prepare returns in 2004. Those two sets of returns both showed that King owed substantial personal income taxes for each of the years he was convicted. There was ample evidence that, <em>inter alia, </em>King (1) used Civil Cadd funds to pay the mortgage on his personal residence throughout 1998 to 2002 and to pay for the construction of a swimming pool at his residence, but booked those payments as Civil Cadd expenses or debts, (2) repeatedly commingled his personal and business funds, (3) channeled transactions through the Civil Cadd account that should have been handled as personal finances, and (4) paid himself hundreds of thousands of Civil Cadd\u2019s dollars and deducted them as corporate expenses or repayment of \u201cloans\u201d rather than listing them as salary or distributions. The trial evidence is replete with conduct designed to evade detection of personal income. We are convinced that King has not shown that more preparation time would have possibly changed the outcome in this case. In the absence of \u201cspecific, substantial prejudice\u201d to King and in light of the overwhelming evidence against King, we cannot say that the district court\u2019s denial of King\u2019s continuance motions require a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-7\">III. Sentencing</p>\n<p id=\"b540-8\">A. Sentencing Guidelines manual</p>\n<p id=\"b540-9\">As noted earlier, the 2006 Sentencing Guidelines manual contains the 2001 amendment to the Tax Table for computing the amount of loss for offenses involving taxation. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. app. C, amend. 617, at 714-15 (2006 ed., vol. 2) (effective Nov. 1, 2001). King\u2019s complaint is that the lower Tax Table in the 1998 manual should have been used.<footnotemark>21</footnotemark> We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-10\">First, the district court properly sentenced King under the 2006 Sentencing Guidelines manual because it was in effect at the time of his January 30, 2007 sentencing. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(4); U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lBl.ll(a)-(b)(l) (\u201cThe court shall use the Guidelines Manual in effect on the date that the defendant is sentenced .... If the court determines that use of the Guidelines Manual in effect on the date that the defendant is sentenced would violate the <em>ex post facto </em>clause of the United States Constitution, the court shall use the Guidelines Manual in effect on the date that the offense of conviction was committed.\u201d); <em>United States v. Aviles, </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>518 F.3d 1228, 1230 (11th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 129 S.Ct. 297, 172 L.Ed.2d 217 (2008) (\u201cA defendant is sentenced using the Guidelines Manual in effect at the time of sentencing, unless this would raise <em>ex post facto </em>concerns, in which case the defendant is sentenced using the Guidelines Manual in effect at the time the crime was committed.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b541-6\">Second, there is no <em>ex post facto </em>problem because King is being sentenced for a series of related crimes that went past 2001 and into 2002. <em>See United States v. York, </em>428 F.3d 1325, 1337 (11th Cir.2005) (\u201c[I]f related crimes are committed in a series, the date of the crime at the end of the series governs the date of the Manual to be used.\u201d). King had fair notice that continuing his crimes past 2001 subjected him to the Tax Table in effect when he committed the last of the crimes for which he was convicted. <em>See United States v. Bailey, </em>123 F.3d 1381,1405 (11th Cir.1997) (\u201c[A] defendant knows, when he continues to commit related crimes, that he risks sentencing for all of his offenses under the latest, amended Sentencing Guidelines Manual.\u201d). Because the 2001 Tax Table was in effect at the time King committed the last two offenses in his series of offenses and the 2006 manual still uses that 2001 Tax Table, there are no <em>ex post facto </em>concerns. Thus, the district court did not err in sentencing King under the 2006 Sentencing Guidelines manual.<footnotemark>22</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b541-8\">B. Special verdict forms</p>\n<p id=\"b541-9\">Even if the 2006 manual with the 2001 Tax Table applies, King proffers three reasons the district court improperly determined the amount of loss: (1) the jury did not return a special verdict; (2) the district court did not make a reasonable estimate of loss based on the available facts; and (3) the district court held King responsible for the 1998 and 2000 tax years despite not being prosecuted for 1998 and being acquitted of the year 2000 charge. Each claim lacks merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-10\">First, the district court did not err in making its own finding on the amount of loss instead of directing the jury to return a special verdict. \u201c[T]he sentencing Guidelines require a district court, at the sentencing stage, to make <em>independent </em>findings establishing the factual basis for its Guidelines calculations.\u201d <em>See United States v. Hamaker, </em>455 F.3d 1316, 1338 (11th Cir.2006). \u201cThe district court should ... assess[ ] independently the relevant loss for sentencing purposes rather than deferring to the jury\u2019s view of the scope of Appellants\u2019 guilt....\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b541-11\">Second, the evidence at trial fully supports the district court\u2019s findings that the tax loss amount from King\u2019s offenses exceeded $400,000.<footnotemark>23</footnotemark> For example, King\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>second returns for 1999 through 2002 are in evidence and alone show tax losses of $473,090. The district court aptly stated that \u201cjust on the basis of the returns which essentially he filed himself, he has established he is in excess of the $400,000 base by $162,649.\u201d The district court explained that it was relying on the trial evidence in finding that it was \u201csatisfied that there is certainly sufficient evidence to satisfy the burden which is a preponderance of the evidence.\u201d This clearly constitutes a reasonable estimate of loss based on the record.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">Third, the district court did not err in including the monies owed for the non-prosecution year of 1998 and the acquitted year of 2000 in its final estimate of amount owed. It is well established that a sentencing court may consider uncharged and acquitted conduct in determining an appropriate sentence. <em>Id. </em>at 1336; <em>United States v. Hasson, </em>333 F.3d 1264,1279 n. 19 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b542-5\">C. Sophisticated means enhancement</p>\n<p id=\"b542-6\">Lastly, we turn to King\u2019s claim that the district court erred in imposing a two-level sophisticated means enhancement because there was no evidence of fictitious employees, offshore accounts, or sophisticated bookkeeping.</p>\n<p id=\"b542-7\">Section 2T1.1(b)(2) provides, \u201cIf the offense involved sophisticated means, increase by 2 levels.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2T1.1(b)(2). For purposes of \u00a7 2T1.1(b)(2), \u201csophisticated means\u201d means \u201cespecially complex or especially intricate offense conduct pertaining to the execution or concealment of an offense.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 2T1.1 cmt. n. 4. The commentary includes a non-exhaustive list of sophisticated means such as \u201chiding assets or transactions, or both, through the use of fictitious entities, corporate shells, or offshore financial accounts.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b542-11\">We have affirmed a district court\u2019s sophisticated means enhancement where the defendant used multiple bank accounts, cash, checks, or other financial instruments to conceal income and the discovery of his tax evasion. <em>See United States v. Campbell, </em>491 F.3d 1306, 1315-16 (11th Cir.2007) (affirming sentence enhancement where tax evader \u201cutilized campaign accounts and credit cards issued to other people to conceal cash expenditures in a deliberate attempt to impede the discovery of both the existence and extent of his tax fraud\u201d (quotation marks omitted)); <em>United States v. Barakat, </em>130 F.3d 1448, 1457 (11th Cir.1997) (agreeing with district court\u2019s finding that defendant\u2019s practice of filtering funds through his attorney\u2019s trust account constituted a sophisticated means of concealing tax evasion); <em>United States v. Paradies, </em>98 F.3d 1266, 1292 (11th Cir. 1996) (concluding district court did not err in finding tax evader\u2019s transfer of funds through shell corporations in an attempt to conceal his transactions warranted sophisticated means enhancement).<footnotemark>24</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b543-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>Here, the record amply supports the district court\u2019s findings that King: (1) used Civil Cadd\u2019s shareholder loan account to conceal income; (2) misclassified checks from vendors as loans to hide income from the IRS; (3) paid personal expenses from his corporate accounts and classified them as business expenses; and (4) had employees cash business checks and give him the money. King did not merely fail to report income, but commingled and manipulated his corporate and personal finances in order to conceal the existence, or at least large amounts, of his personal income. There was also testimony that King structured his bank account withdrawals to avoid currency transaction reports. Like the defendant in <em>Campbell, </em>King \u201cconceal[ed] cash expenditures in a deliberate attempt to impede the discovery of both the existence and extent of his tax fraud.\u201d 491 F.3d at 1315 (quotation marks omitted). The fact that King did not use fictitious companies or bank accounts does not preclude him from receiving the enhancement. <em>See id. </em>at 1316 (stating \u201c[t]he fact that Campbell did not use offshore bank accounts or transactions through fictitious business entities is unavailing\u201d). We therefore conclude the district court did not err in finding that King\u2019s tax evasion involved sophisticated means and in imposing the two-level enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-5\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b543-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm King\u2019s convictions and sentences.</p>\n<p id=\"b543-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b525-9\">.
