HARTZ, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b447-11\">Dale E. McCormick was convicted of aggravated kidnapping, aggravated burglary, aggravated intimidation of a witness, and four drug-related charges in Kansas state court and sentenced to 213 months\u2019 imprisonment. He filed an application for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254 in the United States District Court for the District of Kansas. The district court dismissed the application because Mr. McCormick had not exhausted his state-court remedies on some of the grounds for relief raised in the application. Mr. McCormick seeks a certificate of appealability (COA) to appeal the dismissal. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c) (requiring COA to appeal dismissal of \u00a7 2254 application). Because a reasonable jurist could not debate the correctness of the district court\u2019s decision, we deny a COA and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-12\">Mr. McCormick\u2019s \u00a7 2254 application raised nine grounds for relief: (1) he was denied the right to a disinterested prosecutor; (2) the trial court erred in failing to suppress evidence seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment; (3) he was denied his Sixth Amendment right to counsel; (4) prosecutorial misconduct denied him the rights to due process and a fair trial; (5) the trial court denied his right to confront witnesses by refusing to allow him to use the victim\u2019s diary at trial; (6) the trial court\u2019s jury instruction on the bodily-harm element of the aggravated-kidnapping charge denied him the right to due process; (7) one of the prosecution\u2019s alternative theories on the aggravate-dintimidation-of-a-witness charge was invalid; (8) he received ineffective assistance of appellate counsel; and (9) cumulative error rendered his convictions unconstitutional.</p>\n<p id=\"b447-14\">Respondent filed a motion to dismiss for failure to exhaust available state-court remedies, arguing that Mr. McCormick had properly exhausted only three of the nine grounds raised in his application. In his response to the motion, Mr. McCormick contended that all his claims had been exhausted. Alternatively, he contended that if the district court found any of his grounds for relief to be unexhausted, the exhaustion requirement should be excused because of (1) an inordinate delay by the State courts in adjudicating his direct appeal, (2) ineffective assistance of appointed appellate counsel, and (3) the failure of the State courts to provide a \u201cfull and fair adjudication\u201d of his constitutional claims. R. Doc. 27 at 14 (internal quotation marks omitted). These failings, he asserted, rendered the State process \u201cineffective to protect the rights of the applicant\u201d and therefore came under the exception to the exhaustion requirement provided by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(l)(B)(2). <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b447-15\">The district court rejected Mr. McCormick\u2019s arguments and determined that he had exhausted only three of his claims for relief: (1) denial of his Sixth Amendment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"426\">*426</page-number>right to counsel; (2) failure to suppress evidence seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment; and (3) prosecutorial misconduct violating his rights to due process and a fair trial. It then granted Mr. McCormick 20 days to take one of two actions: (1) to dismiss or withdraw his \u201cmixed petition\u201d voluntarily to enable him to exhaust state remedies on all his claims, or (2) to file an amended petition with only his exhausted claims. Because Mr. McCormick chose neither option, the district court dismissed his \u00a7 2254 application without prejudice and denied his application for a COA.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-4\">A COA will issue \u201conly if the applicant has made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(2). This standard requires \u201ca demonstration that ... includes showing that reasonable jurists could debate whether (or, for that matter, agree that) the petition should have been resolved in a different manner or that the issues presented were adequate to deserve encouragement to proceed further.\u201d <em>Slack v. McDaniel, </em>529 U.S. 473, 484, 120 S.Ct. 1595,146 L.Ed.2d 542 (2000) (internal quotation marks omitted). In other words, an applicant must show that the district court\u2019s resolution of the constitutional claim was either \u201cdebatable or wrong.\u201d <em>Id. </em>If the application was denied on procedural grounds, the applicant faces a double hurdle. Not only must the applicant make a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional right, but he must also show \u201cthat jurists of reason would find it debatable ... whether the district court was correct in its procedural ruling.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cWhere a plain procedural bar is present and the district court is correct to invoke it to dispose of a case, a reasonable jurist could not conclude either that the district court erred in dismissing the petition or that the petitioner should be allowed to proceed further.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b448-5\">A habeas applicant ordinarily must exhaust the remedies available in state court before filing a \u00a7 2254 application in federal district court. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(b)(1)(A). The Supreme Court has held that a district court must dismiss a \u00a7 2254 application that contains both unexhausted and exhausted claims. <em>Rose v. Lundy, </em>455 U.S. 509, 522, 102 S.Ct. 1198, 71 L.Ed.2d 379 (1982). This total-exhaustion rule, however, may be excused under \u00a7 2254(b)(1)(B)(i) \u2014 (ii) if \u201cthere is an absence of available State corrective process\u201d or \u201ccircumstances exist that render such process ineffective to protect the rights of the applicant.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b448-6\">In his brief to this court, Mr. McCormick contends that the district court should have excused the exhaustion requirement under \u00a7 2254(b)(1)(B)(ii) because he proved that the State corrective process is ineffective to protect his rights. He asserts that the Kansas state courts failed to afford him a \u201cfull and fair adjudication,\u201d Aplt. Br. at 7 (internal quotation marks omitted), of two of the claims that he presented on direct appeal: (1) the legality of the search warrant used to search his residence, and (2) the legality of the search of his backpack at the time of his arrest. These two claims, however, were admitted by respondent to have been exhausted. Mr. McCormick\u2019s brief does not provide any reasons why the exhaustion requirement should be excused for the six grounds for relief in his \u00a7 2254 application that were found not to have been exhausted, and we discern none. No jurist of reason could debate the correctness of the district court\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b448-7\">Accordingly, we DENY a COA and DISMISS this appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
