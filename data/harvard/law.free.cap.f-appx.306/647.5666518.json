We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the procedural history, and the issues presented for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b670-12\"> The Cowards\u2019 due process claim was properly dismissed because, under the circumstances, they received adequate notice and opportunity to be heard. Notice of the state\u2019s temporary suspension of them operating certificate was received on September 8, 2004, and a temporary suspension hearing was held on October 6, 2004. (There is no claim that the Cowards were denied due process at the hearing). On November 4, 2004, the Cowards received notice of the state\u2019s intent to permanently revoke them certificate, and that they could request a hearing within thirty days. By failing to request such a hearing, the Cowards waived their right to challenge the adequacy of the revocation procedures. <em>See, e.g., Narumanchi v. Bd. of Trs. of Connecticut State Univ., </em>850 F.2d 70, 72 (2d Cir.88)(\u201cNarumanehi\u2019s failure to submit to the grievance procedures precludes consideration of the fairness of those proceedings in practice.\u201d); <em>Baird v. Bd. of Educ., </em>389 F.3d 685, 694-95 (7th Cir.2004)(\u201cWe have frequently held that terminated employees who do not avail themselves of pre-termination hearings waive their right to contest the adequacy of such hearings.\u201d) In light of what the Cowards knew from the earlier hearing, the letter contained sufficient notice of the state\u2019s allegations. Hence the Cowards received all process due under the circumstances. <em>Cf. Mathews v. Eldridge, </em>424 U.S. 319, 334-35, 96 S.Ct. 893, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b670-14\"> The district court\u2019s dismissal of the Cowards\u2019 First Amendment retaliation claim was also proper. Even assuming a causal connection between their speech and any adverse employment action, <em>see Washington v. County of Rockland, </em>373 F.3d 310, 320-321 (2d Cir.2004), the Cowards\u2019 speech did not address a matter of public concern. <em>See Gronowski v. Spencer, </em>424 F.3d 285, 292 (2d Cir. 2005)(\u201c[T]o prevail on a First Amendment retaliation claim, a public employee must demonstrate that her speech addressed a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"649\">*649</page-number>matter of public concern....\u201d). \u201cWhether an employee\u2019s speech addresses a matter of public concern is a question of law for the court to decide, taking into account the content, form, and context of a given statement as revealed by the whole record.\u201d <em>Lewis v. Cowen, </em>165 F.3d 154, 163 (2d Cir.1999) (citing <em>Connick v. Myers, </em>461 U.S. 138, 147-48 and n. 7, 103 S.Ct. 1684, 75 L.Ed.2d 708 (1983)). \u201cThe heart of the matter is whether the employee\u2019s speech was calculated to redress personal grievances or whether it had a broader public purpose.\u201d <em>Ruotolo v. City of New York, </em>514 F.3d 184, 189 (2d Cir.2008) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). In this case, the Cowards\u2019 speech was essentially personal in nature, as it concerned the medical care of one individual, even if one of their comments could be construed broadly to implicate broader matters. <em>Cf. Ezekwo v. New York City Health &amp; Hosps. Corp., </em>940 F.2d 775, 781 (2d Cir.1991).</p>\n<p id=\"b671-5\">Finding no merit in the Cowards\u2019 remaining arguments, we hereby AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
