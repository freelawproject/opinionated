First, appellant argues that the District Court\u2019s dismissal of his ease might be considered an acceptance by appellant of appellee\u2019s offer of judgment. Appellant objects to that because the offer apparently purported to include a release of unknown parties. With respect to the first argument, we do not constr\u00fae the district court\u2019s dismissal of the case as encompassing any order that appellee\u2019s offer of judgment was deemed accepted. Rather, we construe the district court\u2019s judgment as acknowledging that appellee had agreed to pay appellant $1,001 plus appellant\u2019s reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs up to the date of the offer of judgment, that same was the maximum recovery to which appellant was entitled, and that there was no longer a live case or controversy. In other words, appellant\u2019s concern in its first argument is resolved, because appellant is not deemed to have accepted appellee\u2019s offer of judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-20\">Appellant\u2019s second argument challenges the validity of the offer of judgment because it was faxed rather than mailed. We doubt the argument has merit, but in any event, the issue is moot. Appellant is entitled to be paid $1,001 plus reasonable attorney\u2019s fees and costs up to the date of the offer \u2014 the maximum to which appellant could have been entitled \u2014 and details <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"497\">*497</page-number>with respect to the offer of judgment are not material.</p>\n<p id=\"b519-5\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b519-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b519-21\">. Neither party shall be entitled to recover from the other any attorney\u2019s fees on this appeal, and each party shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
