Kurji also petitions this court for review of the BIA\u2019s denial of his motion to reconsider the denial of his motion to reopen.</p>\n<p id=\"b152-16\">Kurji does not dispute the BIA\u2019s determination that his motion to reopen was untimely and argues instead that the BIA erred in denying his motion to reopen because he did not become eligible for the adjustment of status justifying the reopening his proceedings until after the 90-day filing period set forth in \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2) had expired. He further contends that this court should toll the 90-day period because the BIA has been inconsistent and arbitrary in its decisions whether to sua sponte reopen proceedings in similar cases. However, this court does not have jurisdiction to consider the BIA\u2019s refusal to sua sponte reopen Kurji\u2019s proceedings. <em>See Ramos-Bonilla v. Mukasey, </em>543 F.3d 216, 220 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b152-17\">Although Kurji also argues that the BIA did not give sufficient reasons for its denial of his motion to reopen, the BIA\u2019s reasons for denial were adequate. Kurji additionally argues that the BIA violated the \u201cconstitutional avoidance doctrine\u201d by arbitrarily depriving him of his liberty and property interests when it denied his motion to reopen. However, this argument lacks merit because there is no liberty interest at stake in a motion to reopen. <em>See Altamirano-Lopez v. Gonzales, </em>435 F.3d 547, 550 (5th Cir.2006). Kurji further asserts that his motion to reopen\u2019s reliance on \u00a7 245 of the LIFE Act \u201cmay\u201d trump \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2), which would transform his motion to reopen into a statutory, rather than a regulatory, right and thus \u201craise[ ] concerns\u201d under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses. However, he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"131\">*131</page-number>has failed to brief this issue, and thus he has abandoned it. <em>See Soadjede v. Ashcroft, </em>324 F.3d 830, 833 (5th Cir.2003); <em>Beasley v. McCotter, </em>798 F.2d 116, 118 (5th Cir.1986).</p>\n<p id=\"b153-5\">Accordingly, Kurji\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b152-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
