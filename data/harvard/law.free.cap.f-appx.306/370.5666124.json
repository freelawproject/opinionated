R.App. P. 34(a)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b393-7\">MEMORANDUM <footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b393-8\">Felipe Miguel Lopez, Jr., appeals the sentence imposed following his guilty plea to importation of cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 952 and 960. He contends that the district court violated his right to due process by considering an adjudication of juvenile delinquency in denying him a \u201csafety valve\u201d reduction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f) and U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5C1.1. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b393-9\">This appeal is barred by Lopez\u2019s waiver, in his plea agreement, of \u201cany right to appeal ... the conviction and sentence ... unless the Court imposes a custodial sentence above the greater of the high end of the guideline range recommended by the Government pursuant to this agreement at the time of sentencing or statutory minimum term.\u201d <em>See United States v. Bibler, </em>495 F.3d 621, 623-24 (9th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 681, 169 L.Ed.2d 533 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-11\">In addition, Lopez\u2019s contention lacks merit. Lopez contends that the district court\u2019s consideration of his juvenile adjudication violated his right to due process because there was no right to a jury trial in the juvenile proceedings. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f) (providing for sentence without regard to statutory minimum if court finds, inter alia, that defendant does not have more than one criminal history point). Therefore, Lopez argues, the \u201cprior conviction\u201d exception of <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 488, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), did not apply, and the fact of the juvenile adjudication was required to be proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt. <em>See United States v. Tighe, </em>266 F.3d 1187, 1194-95 (9th Cir. 2001) (holding that sentence increase under Armed Career Criminal Act beyond statutory maximum violated due process when based on fact of prior juvenile adjudication not charged in indictment and found by jury beyond reasonable doubt). Lopez\u2019s contention is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Labrada-Bustamante, </em>428 F.3d 1252, 1262-63 (9th Cir.2005) (holding that facts allowing a decreased sentence below mandatory minimum pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f) need not be found by jury beyond reasonable doubt), <em>cert. denied, </em>- U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 318, 169 L.Ed.2d 224 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b393-16\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b393-12\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
