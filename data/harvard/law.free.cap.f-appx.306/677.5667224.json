Austin, President of the University of Connecticut, and Peter McFadden, Interim Director of the University of Connecticut Environmental Research Institute for violation of Liu\u2019s constitutional right to due process of law. The District Court concluded that Liu lacked a property right in continuing employment and that, even if he did possess such a right, the process through which he was terminated was constitutionally adequate. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, procedural history, and scope of the issues presented on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-9\">\u201cIn order to prevail on a due process claim, a claimant must [1] identify a constitutionally protected property ... interest and [2] demonstrate that the government has deprived that party of the interest without due process of law.\u201d <em>Weinstein v. Albright, </em>261 F.3d 127, 134 (2d Cir.2001). Constitutionally protected property interests \u201care created and their dimensions are defined by existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law....\u201d <em>Bd. of Regents of State Colls, v. Roth, </em>408 U.S. 564, 577, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972). A collective bargaining agreement may give rise to a property interest in continued employment. <em>See Ciambriello v. County of Nassau, </em>292 F.3d 307, 314 (2d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b700-11\">For substantially the reasons stated by the District Court, however, we agree that Liu did not possess a property right in continued employment. According to the arbitrator\u2019s interpretation of the Collective Bargaining Agreement (\u201cCBA\u201d), to which we owe substantial deference, under the terms of the CBA Liu waived his right to a contract that would have permitted his dismissal only \u201cfor cause.\u201d Liu cannot claim he can only be dismissed \u201cfor cause\u201d under the contract he signed, which specifically set forth the date on which his appointment would expire, or under any other provision of the CBA. Therefore, while Liu may have expected that his appointment would be renewed, he had no constitutionally protected property interest in his continued employment at UCERI. Liu\u2019s due process claim consequently fails. Having so concluded, we need not \u2014 and do not \u2014 reach the question of the adequacy of process in which Liu participated.</p>\n<p id=\"b700-12\">We have considered all of Liu\u2019s arguments and find them to be without merit. Accordingly, we AFFIRM the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
