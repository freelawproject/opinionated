Wilbourne, a teacher, alleged FCSD and Norton, FCSD\u2019s Human Resources Director, retaliated against her, in 2005, by issuing a \u201cletter of directive\u201d to be placed in her personnel file and filing a complaint against her with PSC for \u201cunprofessional conduct\u201d after she: (1) filed a complaint with PSC, in 2003, regarding an incident involving a teacher abusing her disabled son; and (2) confronted, in 2005, an administrator at her son\u2019s school about the school\u2019s projected discipline of her son. Wilbourne alleged PSC and Franklin, a PSC investigator, retaliated against her for her 2003 complaint by improperly investigating the 2005 complaint against <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"475\">*475</page-number>Wilbourne and issuing a reprimand as a result of that investigation.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-5\">Wilbourne makes several arguments on appeal. First, \u201cthe record contains evidence of retaliation.\u201d Second, the district court erred in granting summary judgment with respect to her First Amendment claim because she established her 2003 complaints to PSC were a matter of public concern in that she reported the abuse of her child to a public body and also reported the refusal of the principal to report the abuse. Third, she was \u201centitled to a due process administrative hearing\u201d to appeal PSC\u2019s decision to reprimand her for her actions in 2005 related to her confrontation with her son\u2019s principal. Fourth, the evidence establishes the defendants \u201cacted in concert and undertook actions together to cause harm to [her].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b497-6\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-7\">With respect to her retaliation claim, Wilbourne argues: (1) she engaged in protected conduct; (2) \u201cshe submitted evidence ... that she had not acted improperly and in fact was an excellent teacher;\u201d (3) she submitted evidence \u201cNorton arranged for a biased investigation;\u201d and (4) PSC \u201caltered the charges against [her],\u201d and FCSD and Norton, without informing her, \u201caltered [her] annual review after she had signed it.\u201d She also argues the defendants have not established a non-retaliatory reason for their decisions to discipline her. Wilbourne suggests if the defendants had acted in good faith, Norton would not have altered her annual review after she signed it. Wilbourne contends the \u201cPSC investigation was begun even before PSC had met to decide whether to investigate,\u201d and PSC falsely charged her with abandoning her class.</p>\n<p id=\"b497-8\">We review a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment <em>de novo. Rojas v. Florida, </em>285 F.3d 1339, 1341 (11th Cir. 2002). Summary judgment is proper when the pleadings and accompanying evidence show there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, </em>477 U.S. 317,106 S.Ct. 2548, 2552, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986); Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c). To survive a motion for summary judgment, the nonmoving party must show there is a genuine issue of fact for trial. <em>Cotton v. Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Inc., </em>434 F.3d 1227, 1231 (11th Cir.2006). We view \u201cthe evidence and all reasonable inferences drawn from it in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\u201d <em>Battle v. Board of Regents for Georgia, </em>468 F.3d 755, 759 (11th Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-10\">The ADA provides \u201c[n]o person shall discriminate against any individual because such individual has opposed any act or practice made unlawful by [the ADA] or because such individual made a charge ... under [the ADA].\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12203(a). \u201cThis provision creates a prohibition on retaliation under the ADA that is similar to Title VIPs prohibition on retaliation.\u201d <em>Stewart v. Happy Herman\u2019s Cheshire Bridge, Inc., </em>117 F.3d 1278, 1287 (11th Cir.1997). Accordingly, we assess ADA retaliation claims under the same framework employed for retaliation claims arising under Title VII. <em>Standard v. A.B.E.L. Servs., Inc., </em>161 F.3d 1318, 1328 (11th Cir. 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b497-11\">To establish a <em>prima facie </em>case of ADA retaliation, a plaintiff must show: \u201c(1) that [s]he engaged in statutorily protected activity; (2) that [s]he suffered an adverse employment action; and (3) a causal link between the protected activity and the adverse action.\u201d <em>Id. </em>\u201cOnce a plaintiff has established a <em>prima facie </em>case [of retaliation], the employer then has an opportunity to articulate a legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for the challenged employment <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"476\">*476</page-number>action.\u201d <em>Pennington v. City of Huntsville, </em>261 F.3d 1262, 1266 (11th Cir.2001). If this is accomplished, the plaintiff then bears the ultimate burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence the reason provided by the employer is a pretext for prohibited, retaliatory conduct. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b498-4\">The inquiry into pretext requires us to determine, when viewing <em>all </em>the evidence, whether the plaintiff has raised sufficient doubt as to defendant\u2019s proffered nondiscriminatory reasons to allow a reasonable factfinder to conclude the employer\u2019s proffered legitimate reasons were not the actual motives for its conduct. <em>Combs v. Plantation Patterns, </em>106 F.3d 1519, 1538 (11th Cir.1997). A plaintiff may not establish pretext simply by questioning the wisdom of the employer\u2019s reason. <em>Id. </em>at 1543. \u201cProvided that the proffered reason is one that might motivate a reasonable employer, an employee must meet that reason head on and rebut it.\u201d <em>Chapman v. AI Transp., </em>229 F.3d 1012, 1030 (11th Cir. 2000) <em>(en banc). </em>The inquiry into pretext centers on the employer\u2019s beliefs, rather than the employee\u2019s own perceptions. <em>Holifield v. Reno, </em>115 F.3d 1555, 1565 (11th Cir.1997). Where a defendant offers extensive evidence of legitimate, nondiseriminatory reasons for its actions, conclusory allegations by the plaintiff are insufficient to raise an inference of pretext. <em>Mayfield v. Patterson Pump Co., </em>101 F.3d 1371, 1376 (11th Cir.1996). Claims under Section 504 are subject to the same legal framework as ADA claims. <em>Holbrook v. City of Alpharetta, </em>112 F.3d 1522, 1526 n. 2 (11th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b498-5\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the briefs of the parties, we affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. The evidence Wilbourne presented was either conclusory or insufficient to establish that Norton\u2019s, FCSD\u2019s, and PSC\u2019s reasons for taking an adverse action against her were pretext for discrimination. Wilbourne also failed to cite to any evidence related to Franklin\u2019s actions or motives. We find the district court properly granted summary judgment to the defendants on her ADA and Section 504 claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b498-8\">With respect to her First Amendment claim, Wilbourne argues she established her speech was a matter of public concern because if PSC properly investigated her 2003 complaint by speaking to the child involved, other children in the class, -and other parents, then it would have prevented the teacher from discriminating or abusing more disabled children and would have caused the principal to report such incidents. She stresses this would not help her son at all, and therefore, shows she was acting \u201cfor the public good, and was speaking and petitioning a public agency on a matter of public concern.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b498-9\">A government employer may not retaliate against a public employee for speech protected under the First Amendment. <em>Mitchell v. Hillsborough County, </em>468 F.3d 1276, 1283 (11th Cir.2006). To establish a First Amendment claim of retaliation under \u00a7 1983, an employee must show that: \u201c(1) the speech involved a matter of public concern; (2) the employee\u2019s free speech interests outweighed the employer\u2019s interest in effective and efficient fulfillment of its responsibilities; and (3) the speech played a substantial part in the adverse employment action.\u201d <em>Cook v. Gwinnett County Sch. Dist, </em>414 F.3d 1313, 1318 (11th Cir.2005). The burden then shifts to the employer to show (4) that it would have made the same decision even absent the protected speech. <em>Id. </em>The \u201cthreshold question\u201d of whether the content of an individual\u2019s speech is a matter of public concern, also applies with respect to an alleged violation of an individual\u2019s First Amendment right to petition the govern<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"477\">*477</page-number>ment. <em>D\u2019Angelo v. Sch. Bd. of Polk County, Fla., </em>497 F.3d 1203, 1211 (11th Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-5\">\u201cIn determining whether an employee\u2019s speech touched on a matter of public concern, we look to the content, form, and context of a given statement, as revealed by the whole record,\u201d and determine \u201cwhether the \u2018main thrust\u2019 of the speech in question is essentially public in nature or private.\u201d <em>Mitchell, </em>468 F.3d at 1283 (quotations omitted). Although neither factor is dispositive, we look to: (1) \u201cwhether the speech was communicated to the public at large or privately to an individual;\u201d and (2) \u201cwhat the speaker\u2019s motivation in speaking was.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1283-84. Although \u201ccontent\u201d is the most important factor in assessing whether a particular type of speech is a matter of public concern, when context and motivation indicate that speech is private, speech that otherwise would be considered \u201ca matter of public concern\u201d can be deemed private. <em>Id. </em>at 1284. Complaints to official bodies do not constitute communication to the general public or an attempt to involve the general public. <em>Morgan v. Ford, </em>6 F.3d 750, 755 (11th Cir. 1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b499-6\">Wilbourne\u2019s motives in speaking were entirely personal, and the context of her speech was private. We find the district court properly granted summary judgment to the defendants on her First Amendment claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-7\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-8\">With respect to her due process claim against PSC, Wilbourne argues her right to seek a writ of mandamus from state court in order to obtain an appeal from PSC does not constitute \u201cdue process\u201d because it would mean \u201conly citizens with assets sufficient to retain an attorney to sue PSC in state court ... [would have] a real right to due process.\u201d She stresses that, although she has the right to sue in state court in order to \u201cforce the state agency to provide due process,\u201d there is no guarantee relief will be granted.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-10\">To state a claim under \u00a7 1983 for denial of procedural due process, an individual must show \u201cthe state refuse[d] to provide a process sufficient to remedy the procedural deprivation.\u201d <em>Cotton v. Jackson, </em>216 F.3d 1328, 1330-31 (11th Cir.2000) (quotations omitted). \u201cThis rule ... recognizes that the state must have the opportunity to remedy the procedural failings of its subdivisions and agencies in the appropriate fora \u2014 agencies, review boards, and state courts[ \u2014 ] before being subjected to a claim alleging a procedural due process violation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1331. \u201cUnder Georgia law, when no other specific legal remedy is available and a party has a clear legal right to have a certain act performed, a party may seek mandamus.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1332; O.C.G.A. \u00a7 9-6-20. The right to seek a writ of mandamus is an adequate remedy to ensure an individual is not deprived of her due process rights. <em>Cotton, </em>216 F.3d at 1333.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-11\">Wilbourne had a state court remedy to PSC\u2019s failure to consider an appeal of its decision to reprimand her. The district court properly granted summary judgment to PSC as to her due process claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-12\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-13\">Finally, Wilbourne argues the evidence establishes the defendants \u201cacted in concert and undertook actions together to cause harm to [her].\u201d She contends she has shown \u201cthe nexus between the parties and the common acts to further harm\u201d her.</p>\n<p id=\"b499-14\">To state a claim under \u00a7 1985(3), an individual must show: \u201c(1) a conspiracy; (2) for the purpose of depriving, either directly or indirectly, any person or class of persons of the equal protection of the laws, or of equal privileges and immunities under the laws; and (3) an act in furtherance of the conspiracy; (4) whereby a per<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"478\">*478</page-number>son is either injured in his person or property or deprived of any right or privilege of a citizen of the United States.\u201d <em>Park v. City of Atlanta, </em>120 F.3d 1157, 1161 (11th Cir.1997). \u201cIn order to establish a \u00a7 1985(3) conspiracy claim, [a plaintiff] must show an agreement between two or more persons to deprive [her] of [her] civil rights.\u201d <em>Dickerson v. Alachua County Comm\u2019n, </em>200 F.3d 761, 767 (11th Cir.2000). To prove a \u00a7 1983 conspiracy, \u201ca plaintiff must show that the parties reached an understanding to deny the plaintiff ... her rights and prove an actionable wrong to support the conspiracy.\u201d <em>Bailey v. Bd. of County Comm\u2019rs, </em>956 F.2d 1112, 1122 (11th Cir.1992). \u201c[T]he linchpin for conspiracy is agreement^]\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b500-4\">Wilbourne failed to present evidence the defendants had an agreement to violate-her rights. The district court correctly granted summary judgment on her claim of conspiracy. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b500-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
