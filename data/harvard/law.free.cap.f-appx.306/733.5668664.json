On April 18, 2007, as Fisher passed through one of the metal detectors it was activated and he was found to have a pointy shank in his coat lining. Thereafter, Fisher attempted to leave the building.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-6\">Fisher filed a pre-trial motion in limine to exclude or limit evidence of his prior conviction of conspiracy to distribute and possess with intent to distribute crack cocaine and marijuana and aiding and abetting the possession of firearms in furtherance of a drug offense. The District Court denied Fisher\u2019s motion, finding that the prejudicial effect of such evidence did not outweigh its probative value.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-7\">We have jurisdiction to hear this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. To the extent the review is based on the interpretation of a Federal Fule of Evidence (\u201cFRE\u201d), our review is plenary. <em>United States v. Serafini, </em>233 F.3d 758, 768 n. 14 (3d Cir.2000). Decisions to admit or exclude evidence under FRE 609(a)(1) are reviewed for an abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Johnson, </em>302 F.3d 139, 152 (3d Cir.2002) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b756-8\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-9\">On appeal Fisher raises two issues. First, Fisher contends that the District Court misinterpreted and misapplied FRE 609. He argues that the details of his prior conviction had no probative value and were unfairly prejudicial because of the similarity between the current and prior charges. Second, Fisher alleges that the District Court failed to charge the jury correctly on a matter of law. He contends that the consciousness of guilt instruction given was \u201cunnecessary, inaccurate and misleading.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 22.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-11\">In considering the first issue, we note that after the District Court\u2019s adverse ruling on Fisher\u2019s in limine motion, Fisher testified at trial introducing evidence of his prior conviction in his direct testimony. Because he did so, Fisher has lost his challenge to the admission of his prior conviction. \u201cOnly when the Government exercises its option to elicit the testimony is an appellate court confronted with a case where ... the defendant can claim the denial of a substantial right if in fact the district court\u2019s ... ruling proved to be erroneous.\u201d <em>Ohler v. United States, </em>529 U.S. 753, 759, 120 S.Ct. 1851, 146 L.Ed.2d 826 (2000). In this case, Fisher volunteered this information on direct. It is the defendant\u2019s choice whether to \u201cremove the sting\u201d by introducing a prior conviction on direct or wait to have the government elicit this information. <em>Id. </em>at 758, 120 S.Ct. 1851. Fisher made a tactical choice that produced a less than desired result.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-12\">It follows that \u2014 assuming <em>arguendo </em>that the District Court\u2019s in limine ruling permitting impeachment by prior conviction was erroneous \u2014 any possible harm from this ruling is speculative. <em>Luce v. United States, 469 </em>U.S. 38, 41, 105 S.Ct. 460, 83 L.Ed.2d 443 (1984). Arguably, Fisher may have believed that he had no choice but to \u201cremove the sting\u201d by introducing evidence of his prior conviction in light of the District Court\u2019s in limine ruling. However, Fisher did not even renew his objection at trial, and thus did not ascertain whether the trial court would change its mind about the in limine ruling. Therefore, it was not an abuse of discretion for the District Court to have ruled as it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b756-13\">Moreover, even if we were to review the issue on the merits, the result would be the same. The District Court reviewed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"735\">*735</page-number>the factors pertinent under FRE 609(a)(1), and we agree with its analysis.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-5\">Turning to the second issue, we review the Court\u2019s decision to give or \u201crefusal to give a particular instruction or the wording of instructions for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Jimenez, </em>513 F.3d 62, 74 (3d Cir.2008) (quoting <em>United States v. Leahy, </em>445 F.3d 634, 642 (3d Cir.2006)). The total instruction is considered, not just a sentence or paragraph in isolation. <em>Id. </em>at 74-75.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-6\">We disagree with Fisher\u2019s contention that the consciousness of guilt instruction to the jury was \u201cunnecessary, inaccurate and misleading.\u201d Appellant\u2019s Br. at 22. It is well established that evidence of flight is admissible as evidence of consciousness of guilt. <em>United States v. Green, </em>25 F.3d 206, 210 (3d Cir.1994). In this case, once Fisher activated the alarm when he walked through the metal detector, he made a U-turn in an attempt to exit the building. In light of the prison environment, that was akin to flight after commission of a crime. Fisher argues that the instruction on consciousness of guilt usurped the jury\u2019s fact-finding function, but we disagree. The Court specified in its instruction that \u201c[t]his conduct may indicate he thought he was guilty of the crime charged.... On the other hand, sometimes an innocent person may engage in such conduct for some other reason. Whether or not this evidence causes you to find that the defendant was conscious of his guilt of the crime charged, and whether that indicates that he committed the crime charged, is entirely up to you as the sole judges of the facts.\u201d App. at 254. This instruction was neither inaccurate nor misleading.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-7\">Further, Fisher\u2019s assertion that when he contemplated fleeing the crime had not been completed is without merit. The alleged crime was the possession of the shank. The shank was in Fisher\u2019s possession, hence the crime was completed.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-9\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b757-10\">For the above-stated reasons, we will affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
