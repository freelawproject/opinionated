RMJC operates the Show and Tel Show Bar, an adult nightclub, and was found liable in Pennsylvania state court for injuries suffered on an outside stairway by patron Mark Jaworski. The state court determined Jaworksi\u2019s injuries occurred as a result of his removal from the club after an altercation with its security personnel, also known as bouncers. The District Court declared Essex had no duty to indemnify RMJC against the state-court judgment and ordered RMJC to reimburse Essex for the $410,315.15 it had paid to satisfy the judgment. RMJC contends the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"751\">*751</page-number>District Court erred as a matter of law in finding Essex had no duty to indemnify. RMJC argues further that even if Essex was not obliged to pay the state-court judgment, it is not entitled to restitution for amounts it voluntarily paid. For the following reasons, we will affirm.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b773-5\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-6\">This case is before us for a second time. A more complete description of the facts can be found in our previous decision, in which we reversed the District Court\u2019s grant of summary judgment in favor of RMJC. <em>Essex Ins. Co. v. Starlight Mgmt. Co., </em>198 Fed.Appx. 179 (3d Cir.2006) (nonprecedential). The parties\u2019 dispute centers on an exclusion provision in the insurance policy:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-7\">This insurance does not apply to any claim, suit, cost or expense arising out of:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b773-8\">Assault and/or Battery or out of any act or omission in connection with the prevention or suppression of such acts, whether caused by or at the instigation or direction of any Insured, Insured\u2019s employees, patrons or any other person.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ApT\">The District Court originally granted summary judgment for RMJC on the ground that Jaworski\u2019s successful state-court action pursued only negligence claims, which are covered under the insurance policy. But because the state-court jury was not asked to consider whether there was an assault, we determined the jury\u2019s finding was not conclusive as to whether the policy exclusion applied. We vacated the summary judgment order and remanded for further factual development. After a hearing, the District Court found Essex had \u201cproven by a preponderance of the evidence that Jaworski\u2019s injuries at the Show and Tel ... arose out of an assault and battery and that there was \u2018but for\u2019 causation between the assault and battery and his injuries.\u201d Accordingly, it held the insurance policy did not cover the state-court judgment and awarded Essex restitution for having earlier paid the judgment on RMJC\u2019s behalf.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b773-13\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-14\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-15\">RMJC identifies five ways in which the District Court purportedly erred as a matter of law in declaring Essex had no duty to indemnify its insured against Jaworksi\u2019s injuries.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> None of its contentions have merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b773-16\">First, RMJC claims the District Court erred by construing the term \u201carising out of\u2019 in the insurance policy exclusion to refer to \u201cbut for\u201d causation rather than proximate causation. In RMJC\u2019s view, this interpretive difference could be dis-positive because a policy excluding from coverage only those injuries that are proximately caused by assaults will indemnify more broadly than a policy excluding from coverage any injury for which an assault is a \u201cbut for\u201d cause. Under Pennsylvania law, which both parties agree governs our interpretation of the insurance policy, am<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"752\">*752</page-number>biguous policy provisions are to be construed against the insurer. <em>Minn. Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Greenfield, </em>579 Pa. 333, 855 A.2d 854, 861 (2004). Pointing to cases in which Pennsylvania courts have construed \u201carising out of\u2019 to mean \u201cbut for\u201d causation where it describes the injuries or claims <em>covered </em>by an insurance policy, RMJC argues that where, as here, the same phrase describes <em>exclusions </em>from coverage, it should be construed against the insured to mean proximate causation.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-4\">The flaw in RMJC\u2019s argument is that \u201carising out of\u2019 is not an ambiguous term. \u201cWhere ... the language of the contract is clear and unambiguous, a court is required to give effect to that language.\u201d <em>Id. </em>RMJC does not identify a single case in which \u201carising out of\u2019 has been interpreted in terms of proximate causation. In fact, courts applying Pennsylvania law have held the phrase denotes \u201cbut for\u201d causation both where it defines what is included in coverage <em>and </em>where it delineates exclusions. <em>See, e.g., Forum Ins. Co. v. Allied Sec., Inc., </em>866 F.2d 80, 82 (3d Cir.1989); <em>Madison Constr. Co. v. Harleysville Mut. Ins. Co., </em>557 Pa. 595, 735 A.2d 100, 109-10 (1999). The District Court construed the phrase correctly.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-5\">Second, RMJC contends the District Court improperly relied on the state-court conviction of Terrence Benson, one of RMJC\u2019s security guards, for assaulting Jaworksi on the night in question. RMJC notes that Jaworski\u2019s injuries occurred when he fell (or, as the District Court concluded, was thrown down) the stairs, whereas Benson was convicted for earlier conduct inside the premises. In RMJC\u2019s view, Benson\u2019s assault could not be the proximate cause of Jaworski\u2019s injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-6\">Insofar as RMJC\u2019s argument hinges on a proximate causation standard, it misinterprets the language of the insurance policy, as explained above. Moreover, Benson\u2019s conviction is not the only evidence on which the District Court\u2019s judgment rests. On the basis of testimony from several witnesses, the District Court determined Jaworski was assaulted both inside the club and on the stairway. It did not find \u2014 nor, given the language of the policy exclusion, did it need to find \u2014 that Benson himself committed the assault on the stairway.</p>\n<p id=\"b774-8\">Third, RMJC asserts the District Court erred in applying the assault exclusion without finding a specific intent on the part of any actor to harm Jaworski. According to RMJC, an exclusion for assault requires a finding of actual subjective intent on the part of the alleged assailant to cause not just the act but also the resulting injury; inferring intent from conduct is impermissible. But all of the cases cited by RMJC in support of this proposition involve insurance policy language excluding coverage only for harm that is specifically expected or intended by the insured. <em>See Aetna Life &amp; Cas. Co. v. Barthelemy, </em>33 F.3d 189 (3d Cir.1994) (bodily injury or property damage \u201cexpected or intended by any insured\u201d); <em>Wiley v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>995 F.2d 457 (3d Cir.1993) (bodily injury or property damage \u201cexpected or intended by an insured\u201d); <em>Greenfield, </em>579 Pa. 333, 855 A.2d 854 (injuries \u201cexpected or intended by the insured\u201d); <em>Mohn v. Am. Cas. Co. of Reading, </em>458 Pa. 576, 326 A.2d 346 (Pa.1974) (\u201cintentionally self inflicted injury\u201d); <em>United Servs. Auto. Ass\u2019n v. Elitzky, </em>358 Pa.Super. 362, 517 A.2d 982 (Pa.Super.1986) (bodily injury or property damage \u201cexpected or intended by the insured\u201d). The exclusion provision at issue here contains no such language, and RMJC cites no cases indicating that specific intent to cause harm is a required element of the tort of assault. On the contrary, Pennsylvania courts have applied assault and battery exclusions without inquiring into the' assailant\u2019s specific intent. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"753\">*753</page-number><em>See, e.g., Acceptance Ins. Co. v. Seybert, </em>757 A.2d 380 (Pa.Super.2000); <em>Britanico Underwriters, Inc. v. Grzeskiewicz, </em>433 Pa.Super. 55, 639 A.2d 1208 (1994). The District Court\u2019s judgment requires only a finding \u2014 which the court made \u2014 that Jaworski\u2019s injuries arose out of an assault, not a determination of a particular actor\u2019s specific intent to inflict those injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-5\">RMJC\u2019s final two allegations of error relate to the fact that the District Court did not identify the specific assailants) who caused Jaworski\u2019s injuries. First, RMJC argues the exclusion would not apply if the assailant(s) was not an RMJC employee because RMJC\u2019s state-court liability was predicated only on the acts of its employees, not the acts of other parties. Second, RMJC contends the exclusion would not apply if the actor(s) who was negligent for purposes of the state-court judgment was distinct from the actor(s) who assaulted Jaworski. It is true that the District Court did not determine who assaulted Jaworski, but the applicability of the exclusion does not depend on the identity of the assailant. The exclusion applies as long as an assault was a \u201cbut for\u201d cause of Jaworski\u2019s injuries. It is irrelevant whether the assailant was an RMJC employee, a patron, or neither. Nor does it matter whether the assailant was also the negligent party for purposes of the state-court judgment, so long as the assault was a \u201cbut for\u201d cause of the injuries for which RMJC was held liable. The District Court determined Jaworski was assaulted not only inside the club but also on the stairway \u2014 indeed, it determined he was actually thrown down the stairs. This is a more than sufficient basis for the District Court\u2019s conclusion that an assault was a \u201cbut for\u201d cause of Jaworski\u2019s injuries. Accordingly, the District Court properly held Essex had no duty to indemnify RMJC against the state-court judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-8\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-9\">RMJC argues that regardless of whether Essex had a duty to indemnify, it is not entitled to restitution of the money paid to satisfy the state-court judgment against RMJC. Generally, a party can obtain the equitable remedy of restitution \u201cwhere the claimant [can] show that a benefit was wrongfully secured or passively received, and that it would be unconscionable for the party receiving the benefit to retain it without payment.... We must focus not on the intention of the parties but on the extent [to which] the enrichment is unjust.\u201d <em>Burgettstown-Smith Twp. Joint Sewage Auth. v. Langeloth Townsite Co., </em>403 Pa.Super. 84, 588 A.2d 43, 45 (1991). The District Court found RMJC was unjustly enriched by Essex\u2019s payment of the state-court judgment against it, since, as discussed above, Essex was not obligated to indemnify RMJC.</p>\n<p id=\"b775-10\">RMJC\u2019s argument that restitution is unavailable in this case rests on two different doctrinal grounds. First, RMJC notes that restitution is not available where an express contract governs the parties\u2019 obligations. The District Court endorsed this general principle but determined it did not apply here, since the insurance contract was silent on the question of reimbursement for unobligated payments.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> We agree. A plaintiff is not foreclosed from seeking restitution by the mere existence of a contract with the defendant, but only <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"754\">*754</page-number>where the plaintiff has an <em>\u201calternative right </em>on an enforceable contract.\u201d 26 Richard A. Lord, <em>A Treatise on the Law of Contracts [Williston on Contracts] </em>\u00a7 68:5 (4th ed.2003) (emphasis added). For example, \u201c[w]hen [a] non-breaching party-elects to sue on [a] contract, ordinary contract rules limit compensatory damages to his expectancy interest, even if this measure of relief fails to disgorge the breach-er\u2019s profits.\u201d <em>Curley v. Allstate Ins. Co., </em>289 F.Supp.2d 614, 621 (E.D.Pa.2003); <em>see also Hershey Foods Corp. v. Ralph Chapele, Inc., </em>828 F.2d 989, 999 (3d Cir.1987) (\u201c[W]here the contract \u2018fixes the value of the services involved,\u2019 there can be no recovery under a <em>quantum meruit </em>theory.\u201d). But where, as here, the terms of the contract do not address the compensation owed to a plaintiff for a particular benefit conferred on the defendant, the plaintiff may obtain restitution if the defendant would be unjustly enriched by retaining that benefit. RMJC does not dispute that it was unjustly enriched by Essex\u2019s payment of its liability to Jaworski.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-4\">RMJC\u2019s second argument against restitution presents a closer question. RMJC contends Essex cannot recoup the amount of the state-court judgment because it paid the judgment voluntarily under a mistake of law. Pennsylvania courts do not appear to have decided whether the voluntary payment doctrine precludes recovery of insurance indemnity payments.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b776-5\">When there is no Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision directly on point, we are charged with predicting how it would resolve the question at issue. In order to do so, we must take into consideration (1) what the Pennsylvania Supreme Court has said in related areas, (2) the decisional law of the Pennsylvania intermediate courts, (3) federal cases interpreting state law, and (4) decisions from other jurisdictions that have discussed the issue.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b776-6\"><em>Canal Ins. Co. v. Underwriters at Lloyd\u2019s London, </em>435 F.3d 431, 436 (3d Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b776-7\">Pennsylvania courts have endorsed the general doctrine prohibiting recovery for voluntary payments made due to a mistake of law. In <em>Acme Mkts., Inc. v. Valley View Shopping Ctr., Inc., </em>for example, the Pennsylvania Superior Court held the plaintiff, a tenant of a shopping center, could not recover payments it had made to its landlord for maintenance of the parking lot. 342 Pa.Super. 567, 493 A.2d 736 (1985). The plaintiff contended it had made the payments because it mistakenly believed it had a continuing contractual obligation to maintain the lot, when, in actuality, its lease required maintenance contributions only during an initial term. The court observed that \u201c[i]f this interpretation was erroneous, the mistake was one of law. Payments made pursuant to a mistake of law cannot be recovered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 738.</p>\n<p id=\"b776-8\">In an earlier case, we predicted the Pennsylvania Supreme Court would not allow an insurer to recover the cost of defending an insured if it was later determined the insurer had no duty to do so. <em>Terra Nova Ins. Co. v. 900 Bar, Inc., </em>887 F.2d 1213, 1219-20 (3d Cir.1989). We reasoned that \u201c[a] rule permitting such recovery would be inconsistent with the legal principles that induce an insurer\u2019s offer to defend under reservation of rights\u201d because such a rule would effectively require the insured \u201cto pay for the insurer\u2019s action in protecting itself against the estoppel to deny coverage that would be implied if it undertook the defense without reservation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Similarly, a district court has held that an insurer could not recover a payment made to settle a malpractice suit. <em>Coregis Ins. Co. v. Law Offices of Carole F. Kafrissen, P.C., </em>140 F.Supp.2d. 461 (E.D.Pa.2001). In that case, prior to the settlement payment, the underlying malpractice suit in state court had been stayed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"755\">*755</page-number>pending the outcome of the federal action determining whether the insurer had a duty to defend and indemnify.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-5\">Notwithstanding this case law, we are confident the Pennsylvania Supreme Court would allow Essex to recover its indemnity payment. \u201cThe rule disallowing recovery when payments have been made under a mistake of law is supported as a corollary of the criminal law maxim that one is presumed to know the law and that to hold otherwise would render legal accountability unenforceable.\u201d <em>Acme, </em>493 A.2d at 737. Consistent with this rationale, \u201c[t]he voluntary payment defense ... is inapplicable when money is paid by a person without \u2018full knowledge of the facts.\u2019 \u201d <em>Liss &amp; Marion, P.C. v. Recordex Acquisition Corp., </em>937 A.2d 503, 514 (Pa.Super.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-6\">Essex\u2019s payment falls into this excluded category. Essex was obliged to defend RMJC in state-court proceedings that resulted in an adverse judgment. <em>Essex Ins. Co. v. RJMC, Inc., </em>No. 01-4049, 2002 WL 32348287 (E.D.Pa. Jan. 17, 2002). Essex\u2019s payment of that judgment, unlike the plaintiffs payment in <em>Acme, </em>was not due to a misinterpretation of contractual language. Essex knew it had no obligation to indemnify RMJC against injuries arising out of an assault. Indeed, it was litigating its liability in federal court on the basis of that proper understanding of the contract. The important question to be resolved was factual: whether Jaworski\u2019s injuries were caused by an assault. To answer that question, the District Court had to make credibility determinations and evaluate witness testimony as to disputed facts. Essex\u2019s uncertainty over how the court would resolve those key factual issues is a far cry from cases where plaintiffs made payments under mistakes of pure law. <em>See, e.g., Home Ins. Co. v. Honaker, </em>480 A.2d 652 (Del.1984) (denying insurer\u2019s claim for recovery of overpayments made to insured in mistaken belief that policy limit was $25,000, rather than actual limit of $10,000).</p>\n<p id=\"b777-9\">Policy considerations also weigh in favor of allowing recovery of indemnity payments in cases like this one. Courts are mindful of the potential conflict of interest that lurks wherever insurers undertake the legal defense of their insureds. In some instances, permitting insurers to seek restitution would exacerbate those conflicts. For example, as <em>Terra Nova </em>and <em>Coregis </em>recognized, allowing restitution for an insurer\u2019s defense or settlement costs risks altering the incentives the law has created for insurers to provide vigorous and effective defenses.</p>\n<p id=\"b777-10\">This incentive structure would not be disrupted by permitting an insurer exhaustively to defend its insured under a reservation of rights, pay a resultant judgment, and then litigate its duty to indemnify. As the District Court observed, Essex\u2019s satisfaction of the state-court judgment protected the interests of all relevant parties. It ensured Jaworski suffered no further delay in receiving the compensation to which he was entitled. It also ensured neither Essex nor RMJC would have to pay the additional post-judgment interest that would have accrued while they litigated the issue of indemnity. Indeed, RMJC appears to miss the irony that it reaped this very benefit in this case, but would not have under the rule it urges. Under its proposed rule, Essex would almost certainly have declined to pay the judgment for fear of foreclosing its ability to seek restitution. RMJC would then have been saddled with a significantly larger debt to Jaworski once Essex was adjudged to have no duty of indemnification.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b778-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>Furthermore, unlike the insured in <em>Honaker, </em>RMJC was plainly on notice at the time of the payment that Essex disputed its obligation to indemnify. <em>Honaker, </em>480 A.2d at 653, 655. This federal action was then pending, and both parties have since litigated it energetically. Awarding restitution to Essex therefore works no unfairness to RMJC, which could not have reasonably changed its position in reliance on Essex\u2019s payment. Precluding recovery, on the other hand, would create inefficient incentives and disserve the interests of insurers, insureds, and injured third parties.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b778-4\">Accordingly, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b773-9\">. The District Court exercised jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332. We have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b773-10\">. Under a reservation of rights, Essex defended RMJC in the state-court tort action and in unsuccessful appeals. Essex satisfied the state-court judgment after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court denied a petition for allowance of appeal and while this declaratory judgment action was pending in District Court. The original judgment was for $350,000, but Essex paid an additional $60,315.15 in delay damages and other costs. <em>See </em>Pa. R. Civ. P. 238.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b773-18\">. We exercise plenary review over a district court\u2019s conclusions of law. <em>\u2019Wartsila NSD N. Am., Inc. v. Hill Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>530 F.3d 269, 273 (3d Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b775-6\">. RMJC notes that the contract does provide for reimbursement of the deductible amount in the event Essex pays to settle a claim or suit, but as the context makes clear, that provision applies in circumstances where the claim or suit falls within the scope of coverage. It cannot reasonably be read as foreclosing reimbursement in all other circumstances, including those in which Essex has no obligation to indemnify.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b777-7\">. The District Court attributed this hypothetical additional liability to delay damages, but these do not accrue after \"the date of the award, verdict or decision.\u201d Pa. R. Civ. P. 238(a)(2). But post-judgment interest would have continued to accumulate at a rate of six <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"756\">*756</page-number>percent per year. 42 Pa. Cons.Stat. \u00a7 8101; 41 Pa. Cons.Stat. \u00a7 202. Essex satisfied the state-court judgment no later than April 2005. If the judgment had remained unpaid up until now, it would have increased by more than $70,000.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"6\">\n<p id=\"b778-27\">. Because we find the bar on recovery of voluntary payments does not apply in these circumstances, we do not address Essex\u2019s contention that this argument has been waived.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
