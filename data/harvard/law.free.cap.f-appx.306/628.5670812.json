Underhill, United States District Judge for the District of Connecticut, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b651-8\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b651-9\">The Government has moved to dismiss the appeal of Gregory Moore on the ground that he had entered into an agreement to waive his appellate rights and then appealed his sentence. It is well-settled in this Court that \u201ca defendant\u2019s knowing and voluntary waiver of his right to appeal a sentence within an agreed upon guideline range is enforceable.\u201d <em>United States v. Djelevic, </em>161 F.3d 104, 106 (2d Cir.1998). This Court has also held that, \u201c[i]n no circumstance ... may a defendant, who has secured the benefits of a plea agreement and knowingly and voluntarily waived the right to appeal a certain sentence, then appeal the merits of a sentence conforming to the agreement.\u201d <em>United States v. Salcido-Contreras, </em>990 F.2d 51, 53 (2d Cir.1993); <em>see also United States v. Morgan, </em>406 F.3d 135, 137-38 (2d Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-10\">Moore pleaded guilty pursuant to a written plea agreement with the Government in which he stipulated that he would not appeal a sentence within or below the Guidelines range. Moore received a Guidelines range sentence. The record indicates that Moore\u2019s waiver was valid because he knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal.<footnotemark>**</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b651-15\">Moreover, as applicable to Moore\u2019s appeal we have previously held that a defendant who has waived his right to appeal and then attempted to challenge his sentence based on the Supreme Court\u2019s subsequent decision in <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), may not do so. <em>See United States v. Lee, </em>523 F.3d 104, 107 (2d Cir.2008) (noting that a defendant\u2019s \u201cinability to foresee that subsequently decided cases would create new appeal issues does not supply a basis for failing to enforce an appeal waiver\u201d and concluding that \u201cneither <em>Kimbrough </em>nor any other legal \u2018developments\u2019 constitute grounds for finding [the defendant\u2019s] appeal waiver unenforceable.\u201d) (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b651-18\">For the foregoing reasons, the Government\u2019s motion to dismiss Moore\u2019s appeal is GRANTED, and the appeal is DISMISSED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"AqcW\"> THE COURT: [B]ecause of your agreement with the government, if I do sentence you to 115 months or less, you have agreed with the government not to appeal or collaterally attack your sentence. Do you understand that?</p>\n<p id=\"b651-21\">THE DEFENDANT: Yes.</p>\n<p id=\"b651-22\">Moore Plea proceeding Tr. 11:6-11, Nov. 8, 2006.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
