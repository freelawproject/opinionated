Keenan, of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b687-20\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b687-21\">The defendant-appellant Altamont Sutherland appeals from a judgment of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (Pauley, J.) entered December 31, 2003, sentencing him primarily to 97 months\u2019 imprisonment, and an order of the district court entered December 22, 2006, declining to resentence Sutherland following a <em>Crosby </em>remand. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"666\">*666</page-number>facts, procedural history, and specification of issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-4\">Sutherland was convicted after a jury trial of conspiring to distribute and to possess with intent to distribute marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 841(a)(1) and 846, and sentenced principally to 97 months\u2019 imprisonment. Sutherland appealed, and the case was then remanded to the district court so that it could determine whether to resentence Sutherland pursuant to <em>United States v. Crosby, </em>397 F.3d 103 (2d Cir. 2005). The district court declined to re-sentence Sutherland, finding that it would not have imposed a materially different sentence on Sutherland if it had known the Sentencing Guidelines were advisory. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b688-5\">Sutherland raises two primary issues on-appeal. First, he argues that the district court erred at his trial by allowing the government to offer into evidence the plea allocutions of two alleged coconspirators, in violation of <em>Crawford v. Washington, </em>541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354, 158 L.Ed.2d 177 (2004). Second, Sutherland argues that the district court erred in declining to resentence him pursuant to <em>United States v. Crosby, </em>without first considering (1) Sutherland\u2019s post-sentencing rehabilitative efforts and (2) the Bureau of Prison\u2019s (\u201cBOP\u201d) decision denying Sutherland admission into its 1000 hour drug treatment program, despite the district court\u2019s recommendation at the original sentencing proceeding that Sutherland be admitted into the program.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b688-6\">As the government concedes, it was erroneous under <em>Crawford </em>to admit the plea allocutions of Sutherland\u2019s alleged co-conspirators at his trial. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Riggi, </em>541 F.3d 94, 102 (2d Cir. 2008) (\u201cIt is ... constitutional error to admit as substantive evidence a plea allocution by a co-conspirator who does not testify at trial unless the co-conspirator is unavailable and there has been a prior opportunity for cross-examination.\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)). Because Sutherland\u2019s counsel failed to object to the introduction of the plea allocutions on Confrontation Clause grounds, we review for plain error. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b688-10\">To establish plain error, there must be (1) an error, (2) that is plain, (3) and that affects substantial rights; if all three requirements are met, then \u201can appellate court [may] exercise its discretion to correct such error only if the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>United States v. Worjloh, </em>546 F.3d 104, 110 (2d Cir.2008) (per curiam) (alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b688-11\">We assume that the conceded error here was plain. It did not, however, affect substantial rights. \u201cAn error affects a defendant\u2019s substantial rights if it is prejudicial and it affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\u201d <em>Riggi, </em>541 F.3d at 102 (internal quotation marks omitted). The admission of the two plea allocutions, in the context of this case, was not prejudicial and did not affect the outcome of the proceedings.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> First, the portions of the plea allocutions read to the jury did not make any reference to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>Sutherland. They were admitted only for the purpose of establishing the existence of the conspiracy charged in the indictment \u2014 an element that was not disputed by defense counsel in more than a perfunctory manner \u2014 and the district court so instructed the jury, both before the allocutions were admitted, and again in its general jury instructions at the close of the case. The jurors must be presumed to have followed these instructions absent any evidence to the contrary, of which there is none here. <em>See United States v. Bermudez, </em>529 F.3d 158, 163 (2d Cir. 2008); <em>see also Tennessee v. Street, </em>471 U.S. 409, 415 n. 6, 105 S.Ct. 2078, 85 L.Ed.2d 425 (1985) (\u201cThe assumption that jurors are able to follow the court\u2019s instructions fully applies when rights guaranteed by the Confrontation Clause are at issue.\u201d). Second, the evidence of the existence of the conspiracy was overwhelming; indeed, Sutherland\u2019s counsel admits that even without the plea allocutions the record contained \u201cample evidence of a conspiracy,\u201d and \u201cthe only real question [was] whether Sutherland had joined it or whether he had merely associated with some of its members.\u201d Accordingly, the plea allocutions were merely cumulative. <em>See United States v. Snype, </em>441 F.3d 119, 129 (2d Cir.2006); <em>United States v. McClain, </em>377 F.3d 219, 223 (2d Cir.2004). Finally, the government made only extremely limited reference to the allocutions in its closing argument. On this record, we are confident that the admission of the plea allocutions was not prejudicial to Sutherland and that their admission did not have any effect on the outcome of Sutherland\u2019s trial.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Accordingly, there is no plain error here.</p>\n<p id=\"b689-7\">Turning to the second issue Sutherland raises, the district court did not err in declining to consider Sutherland\u2019s post-sentencing conduct and the BOP\u2019s decision about Sutherland\u2019s participation in the drug treatment program in making its determination whether to resentence Sutherland on the <em>Crosby </em>remand. We have held that on a <em>Crosby </em>remand, the first task of the district court is to \u201cmake a \u2018threshold determination\u2019 of whether, <em>\u2018based on the circumstances at the time of the original sentence, \u2019 </em>it would have imposed a different sentence had it known the Guidelines were advisory.\u201d <em>United States v. Ferrell, </em>485 F.3d 687, 688 (2d Cir.2007) (per curiam) (quoting <em>Crosby, </em>397 F.3d at 120). \u201cOnly if the district court answers the threshold determination in the affirmative does a resentencing occur.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 688-89. Thus, there can be no error in the district court\u2019s failure to consider Sutherland\u2019s post-sentencing conduct and the BOP\u2019s post-sentencing decision regarding Sutherland\u2019s participation in the drug treatment program, since by definition those facts could not have been taken into account at the time of the original sentence. Indeed, \u201cwe have repeatedly held that a district court <em>is not </em>to consider such evidence on a <em>[Crosby </em>] remand....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 688. (emphasis added).<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> Because the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>determined, <em>\u201cbased on the circumstances at the time of the original </em>sentence,\u201d that it would not have imposed a different sentence under an advisory Guidelines regime, \u201cthat is the end of the matter.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b690-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b688-7\">. To the extent Sutherland might seek to challenge the BOP\u2019s decision itself, this appeal is not the proper forum in which to raise such a challenge. <em>Cf. Levine v. Apker, </em>455 F.3d 71, 78 (2d Cir.2006) (holding that challenges to \"the execution of [a] sentence,\u201d as opposed to \"the lawfulness of [a] sentence,\u201d are properly brought under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b688-12\">. Sutherland was convicted prior to the Supreme Court\u2019s decision in <em>Crawford. </em>This Court has used a modified plain error rule in cases \"where, as here, the source of plain error is a supervening decision.\u201d <em>United States v. Henry, </em>325 F.3d 93, 100 (2d Cir. 2003) (internal quotation marks omitted). Under modified plain error review it is the government, not the defendant, that \u201cbears <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"667\">*667</page-number>the burden to demonstrate that the error ... was harmless.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(alteration in original) (internal quotation marks omitted). The government argues that our modified plain error rule has not survived the Supreme Court's decision in <em>Johnson v. United States, </em>520 U.S. 461, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997). We need not reach this issue, however, as \"we find the error did not affect the defendant's substantial rights even under our more lenient standard.\u201d <em>United States v. Lombardozzi, </em>491 F.3d 61, 74 n. 4 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b689-8\">. Both <em>Riggi </em>and <em>United States v. Becker, </em>502 F.3d 122 (2d Cir.2007), are easily distinguished by, among other things, the sheer number and detailed contents of the plea allocutions admitted in those cases and the cumulative nature of the allocutions admitted in this case.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"5\">\n<p id=\"b689-9\">. We express no opinion as to whether, had the district court determined that it would have imposed a different sentence had it known the Guidelines were advisory, it would <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"668\">*668</page-number>have been proper for the district court to consider the BOP\u2019s decision not to allow Sutherland to participate in the drug treatment program.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
