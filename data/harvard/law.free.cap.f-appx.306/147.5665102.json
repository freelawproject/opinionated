Rodriguez appeals the district court's order denying his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion to reduce his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b170-21\">Rodriguez argues that he is entitled to have his sentence reduced pursuant to Amendment 709, which clarifies, among other things, whether multiple prior offenses are to be counted separately or as a single sentence when calculating criminal history points under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.2(c)(1). He asserts that the application of this c1ari~ring amendment would dramatically lower his sentencing guidelines range and that the amendment should be applied retroactively pursuant to \u00a7 1B1.10(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-34\">Pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), a defendant may have his sentence modified if he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment based upon a sentencing range that subsequently was lowered by the Sentencing Commission. The district court may grant a reduction if consistent with the applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission. \u00a7 8582(c)(2); United States v. Gonzalez-Balderas, 105 F.3d 981, 982 (5th Cir.1997). Section 3582(c)(2) applies oniy to retroactive guideihies amendments, as set forth in the guidelines policy statement. See \u00a7 1B1.10(a); United States v. Shaw, 30 F.3d 26, 28-29 (5th Cir.1994).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-53\">The Sentencing Commission has stated in \u00a7 1B1.10 that unless an amendment is listed in \u00a7 1B1.10(c), a reduction based on the amendment under \u00a7 3582(c) is not consistent with the policy statement ol \u00a7 1B1.10. See \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.1(A)). Amendment 709 is not listed as an amendment covered by the policy statement in \u00a7 1B1.10(c). See \u00a7 1B1.10(c) (May 2008). Therefore, under the plain language of \u00a7 3582(c), a district court is not authorized to reduce a sentence based on Amendment 709 because that would be inconsistent with Sentencing Commission Policy. See \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.1(A)). Moreover, insofar as Rodriguez argues that he is entitled to a reduction of his sentence because Amendment 709 is a clarifying amendment, the court has held that, except on direct appeal, a clarifying amendment is not retroactively applied unless the amendment is listed in \u00a7 1B1.10(c). See United States v. Drath, 89 F.3d 216, 217-18 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b170-77\"> The district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Rodriguez's motion after determinIng that Amendment 709 is not retroactive. United States v. Shaw, 30 F.3d 26, 28 (5th Cir.1994). In any event, Rodriguez would not have been entitled to a sentence reduction because the provision in Amendment 709 that allows multiple offenses to be counted as a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"149\">*149</page-number>single sentence is not applicable in cases, such as Rodriguez\u2019s, where an intervening arrest occurred between offenses. U.S.S.G., App. C Supp., Amend. 709. Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b170-42\"> Pursuant to 5TH Cm. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5m Ciii R, 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
