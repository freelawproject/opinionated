We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b411-5\">Pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(3), we do not have jurisdiction to review the BIA\u2019s discretionary determination that an asylum application was untimely filed. <em>Hakeem v. INS, </em>273 F.3d 812, 815 (9th Cir.2001). Li admits he filed his asylum application on November 1, 1999, which was more than one year after his entry to the United States on September 3, 1998. Li\u2019s claim that he started to work on his application within one year of his entry does not excuse his failure to file within one year, and the facts underlying Li\u2019s claim that extraordinary circumstances allow tolling of the one-year deadline are in dispute. <em>Cf. Husyev v. Mukasey, </em>528 F.3d 1172, 1179 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-6\">The BIA denied Li relief because it found that he was not credible. We review the BIA\u2019s determination for substantial evidence. <em>Kumar v. Gonzales, </em>444 F.3d 1043, 1049 (9th Cir.2006). We must affirm the BIA unless we are compelled to find otherwise. <em>Singh v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 1100, 1110 (9th Cir.2006); <em>Wang v. INS, </em>352 F.3d 1250, 1257 (9th Cir.2003). We find that Li\u2019s inconsistent written statements and oral testimony concerning the duration of his incarceration and his conversation with Master Li are material and go to the heart of Li\u2019s claim. <em>Goel v. Gonzales, </em>490 F.3d 735, 739 (9th Cir.2007). Reviewing the IJ\u2019s determination concerning Li\u2019s knowledge of Falun Gong in light of our recent decision in <em>Cosa v. Mukasey, </em>543 F.3d 1066 (9th Cir.2008), we find that the IJ properly tested the scope of Li\u2019s understanding of his religion and based his adverse credibility finding on Li\u2019s admitted lack of knowledge of Falun Gong. <em>See id. </em>at 1070. In any event, even if this basis for the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding is discounted, there is still substantial evidence in the record to support the BIA\u2019s adverse credibility finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b411-10\">Accordingly, Li\u2019s claim for withholding of removal fails because the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility determination is supported by substantial evidence. Li\u2019s CAT claim also is denied because it is based on the same evidence that the BIA found not credible. <em>Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153,1156-57 (9th Cir.2003). Finally, Li is not entitled to relief on his procedural due process claims concerning ineffective assistance of counsel, judicial bias, and translation difficulties. These claims were not raised before the BIA, thereby barring review by this court. <em>Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 677-78 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b411-11\">DISMISSED IN PART; DENIED IN PART.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b410-16\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
