Benson, </em>193 F.3d 936, 939 (8th Cir.1999) (district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment reviewed de novo), we conclude that the district court properly dismissed Jones\u2019s complaint in No. 07-3282 because defendants established that he failed to exhaust his administrative remedies. <em>See </em>42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a) (\u201c[n]o action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions ... by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted\u201d); <em>Jones v. Bock, </em>549 U.S. 199, 211-17, 127 S.Ct. 910, 166 L.Ed.2d 798 (2007) (failure to exhaust is affirmative defense); <em>Nerness v. Johnson, </em>401 F.3d 874, 876 (8th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (defendant has burden of proving failure to exhaust); <em>Johnson v. Jones, </em>340 F.3d 624, 627 (8th Cir.2003) (inmate must exhaust all available administrative remedies before filing suit; \u201c[i]f exhaustion was not completed at the time of filing, dismissal is mandatory\u201d). However, we modify the dismissal to be without prejudice, <em>see Calico Trailer Mfg. Co. v. Ins. Co. of N. Am., </em>155 F.3d 976, 978 (8th Cir.1998) (affirming dismissal for failure to exhaust administrative remedies, but modifying to be without prejudice), and we affirm the dismissal as modified.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-19\">We further conclude in No. 07-3306 that Jones has waived any challenge to the district court\u2019s dismissal of his complaint <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>because he did not make any arguments related to this dismissal in his opening brief. <em>See Ahlberg v. Chrysler Corp., </em>481 F.3d 630, 634 (8th Cir.2007) (points not meaningfully argued in opening brief are deemed waived). Accordingly, we affirm the dismissal of his complaint.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b362-16\">.
