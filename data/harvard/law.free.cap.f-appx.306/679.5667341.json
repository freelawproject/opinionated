Mar. 27, 2008). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b701-19\">As an initial matter, to the extent that the Petitioner attempts to challenge the merits of the agency\u2019s underlying denial of her applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and Convention Against Torture (\u201cCAT\u201d) relief, and the agency\u2019s April 2004 and November 2007 orders, those orders are not properly before this Court and the petition for review must be dismissed to that extent. <em>See Stone v. INS, </em>514 U.S. 386, 405, 115 S.Ct. 1537, 131 L.Ed.2d 465 (1995); <em>Ke Zhen Zhao v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>265 F.3d 83, 89-90 (2d Cir.2001). Only the BIA\u2019s March 2008 decision denying the Petitioner\u2019s motion to reconsider is properly before us as that is the only decision from which a petition for review was timely filed. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(b)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b701-20\">We review the denial of a motion to reconsider for abuse of discretion. <em>See Ri Kai Lin v. BCIS, </em>514 F.3d 251, 253-54 (2d Cir.2008). The regulations provide that a motion to reconsider must specify errors of fact or law in the BIA\u2019s decision and be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"680\">*680</page-number>supported with pertinent authority. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(b)(1); <em>Jian Hui Shao v. Mukasey, </em>546 F.3d 138, 173 (2d Cir.2008). In her motion to reconsider, the Petitioner simply repeated her assertion that her membership in the Chinese Democratic Party would cause her to be persecuted upon her return to China. Because the Petitioner\u2019s motion simply repeated the same arguments the BIA rejected in denying her motion to reopen, the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying her motion to reconsider. <em>See Jian Hui Shao, </em>546 F.3d at 173 (finding no abuse of discretion where the BIA denied a motion to reconsider that did not point to errors of fact or law and simply repeated arguments); <em>see also Jin Ming Liu v. Gonzales, </em>439 F.3d 109, 111 (2d Cir.2006) (per curiam) (holding that \u201c[t]he BIA does not abuse its discretion by denying a motion to reconsider where the motion [merely] repeats arguments that the BIA has previously rejected.\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b702-4\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED in part and DISMISSED in part. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b702-6\">. We decline to reach Zhao\u2019s unexhausted arguments regarding her fear of persecution under China\u2019s family planning policy. <em>See Lin Zhong v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>480 F.3d 104, 119-20 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
