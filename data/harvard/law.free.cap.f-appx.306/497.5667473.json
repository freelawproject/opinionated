Therefore, he has abandoned those issues. <em>See Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1228 n. 2 (11th Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-7\">On appeal, Melgarejo-Sandoval argues that the BIA erred when it failed to find a nexus between his fear of persecution by the National Liberation Party of Colombia (\u201cELN\u201d) and either his political opinion or his membership in the particular social group consisting of relatives of his father, Arturo Melgarejo. He also argues that the IJ and the BIA erred when they failed to make clear credibility and persecution-factual findings, thus precluding meaningful review of the IJ\u2019s decision, and further erred when they found that relocation within Colombia was a reasonable option, because they failed to address the statutory factors set out in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(3), and because the 2005 and 2006 Country Reports stated that the ELN continued to engage in illegal activities in Colombia.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">\u201cWe review only the [BIA\u2019s] decision, except to the extent that it expressly adopts the IJ\u2019s opinion.\u201d <em>Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1284 (11th Cir. 2001). In the instant case, the BIA issued its own opinion with analysis and did not expressly adopt the IJ\u2019s decision. Therefore, we review only the BIA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-10\">To the extent that the BIA\u2019s decision was based on a legal determination, review is <em>de novo. D-Muhumed v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>388 F.3d 814, 817 (11th Cir.2004). The BIA\u2019s factual determinations, however, are reviewed under the substantial-evidence test, which requires us to \u201cview the record evidence in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision and draw all reasonable inferences in favor of that decision.\u201d <em>Adefemi v. Ashcroft, </em>386 F.3d 1022, 1026-27 (11th Cir.2004) <em>(en banc). </em>We must affirm the BIA\u2019s decision \u201cif it is supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\u201d <em>D-Muhumed, </em>388 F.3d at 818 (quotation omitted). \u201cTo reverse the ... fact findings, we must find that the record not only supports reversal, but compels it.\u201d <em>Mendoza v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>327 F.3d 1283,1287 (11th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b520-11\">I. BIA\u2019s finding that no nexus existed between Melgarejo-Sandoval\u2019s persecution and either his political opinion or his membership in a particular social group</p>\n<p id=\"b520-12\">An alien who arrives in or is present in the United States may apply for asylum. INA \u00a7 208(a)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(1). The Attorney General or Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security has discretion to grant asylum if the alien meets the INA\u2019s definition of a \u201crefugee.\u201d INA \u00a7 208(b)(1), 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(1). A \u201crefugee\u201d is: <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"499\">*499</page-number>any person who is outside any country of such person\u2019s nationality or, in the case of a person having no nationality, is outside any country in which such person last habitually resided, and who is unable or unwilling to return to, and is unable or unwilling to avail himself or herself of the protection of, that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion[.]</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(42)(A). An asylum petitioner must establish a nexus between the feared persecution and the statutorily listed factor. The alien must present \u201cspecific, detailed facts showing a good reason to fear that he or she will be singled out for persecution on account of\u2019 the statutorily listed factor. <em>Forgue v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.8d 1282, 1286 (11th Cir.2005) (quotation omitted). However, the alien does not need to prove that he would be \u201csingled out\u201d for persecution if (1) there is a \u201cpattern or practice\u201d of persecution against similarly situated individuals and (2) his or her inclusion within that group of individuals makes fear of persecution reasonable. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. 208.13(b)(2)(iii). Additionally, one of the five enumerated grounds need not be the only motivation for the persecution, as long as the applicant can show that the persecution is, \u201cat least in part, motivated by a protected ground.\u201d <em>Sanchez Jimenez v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>492 F.3d 1223, 1232 (11th Cir.2007) (citation omitted). The asylum applicant eames the burden of proving statutory \u201crefugee\u201d status. 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 208.13(a); <em>Al Najjar, </em>257 F.3d at 1284.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">Melgarejo-Sandoval testified that after he escaped from an ELN roadblock\u2014 which he encountered during his work as a BellSouth security guard \u2014 and refused to turn over his company\u2019s vehicle and weapons to the ELN, \u201cthat\u2019s when all the threats started.\u201d The BIA found that it was the encounter with the ELN that he had at the roadblock, while working for BellSouth, and his refusal to hand over the weapons and vehicle that led to his harassment. The BIA also agreed with the IJ\u2019s determination that corroboration existed for Melgarejo-Sandoval\u2019s assertion that he accompanied Liberal Party candidates during campaigns, but concluded that those party activities were unrelated to any persecution experienced by Melgarejo-Sandoval. This, there was sufficient evidence that his persecution by the ELN was unrelated to his Liberal Party membership or activities and therefore not \u201cbecause of his political opinion.\u201d <em>Rodriguez Morales v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>488 F.3d 884, 890 (11th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b521-8\">Based on the evidence and viewing the record in the light most favorable to the agency\u2019s decision, the BIA\u2019s determination that Melgarejo-Sandoval was not and will not be persecuted because of his political opinion or his membership in a particular social group is supported by substantial evidence and does not compel reversal.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-9\">II. BIA\u2019s credibility determination and factual findings</p>\n<p id=\"b521-10\">As to factual findings on credibility, the fact-finder must \u201cdetermine credibility, and we may not substitute our judgment for that of the fact-finder with respect to credibility findings.\u201d <em>Yang v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>418 F.3d 1198, 1201 (11th Cir.2005). When a fact-finder \u201csays not that [s]he believes the asylum seeker or [that] [s]he disbelieves her ... the reviewing Court is left in the dark.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citations omitted). If credible, an alien\u2019s testimony may be sufficient, without corroboration, to sustain her burden of proof in establishing her eligibility for relief from removal. <em>Forgue, </em>401 F.3d at 1287. However, our case law mandates that \u201cspecific, cogent reasons\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"500\">*500</page-number>for a credibility determination be given only in the context of adverse credibility findings. <em>See, e.g., id.; D-Muhumed, </em>388 F.3d at 819.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">Because the BIA presumed that Melgarejo-Sandoval\u2019s testimony was credible and therefore was not obligated to provide explicit reasons for its credibility determination, and because there was substantial evidence supporting the BIA\u2019s determination of whether persecution existed, we are not compelled to reverse the BIA\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">III. BIA\u2019s finding that relocation within Colombia was reasonable</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">As stated in 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13, \u201can immigration judge, in the exercise of his or her discretion, shall deny the asylum application of an alien found to be a refugee on the basis of past persecution if ... [t]he applicant could avoid future persecution by relocating to another part of the applicant\u2019s country of nationality ... and under all the circumstances, it would be reasonable to expect the applicant to do so.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(l)(i)(B). Furthermore, \u201c[a]n applicant does not have a well-founded fear of persecution if the applicant could avoid persecution by relocating to another part of the applicant\u2019s country of nationality ... if under all the circumstances it would be reasonable to expect the applicant to do so.\u201d 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(2)(ii). To determine the reasonableness of internal relocation under 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(l)(i) and (b)(2), 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(3) provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"A_R\">[Adjudicators should consider, but are not limited to considering, whether the applicant would face other serious harm in the place of suggested relocation; any ongoing civil strife within the country; administrative, economic, or judicial infrastructure; geographical limitations; and social and cultural constraints, such as age, gender, health, and social and familial ties. Those factors may, or may not, be relevant, depending on all the circumstances of the case, and are not necessarily determinative of whether it would be reasonable for the applicant to relocate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b522-8\">In cases in which the applicant has not established past persecution, the applicant shall bear the burden of establishing that it would not be reasonable for him or her to relocate, unless the persecution is by a government or is government-sponsored.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(3) and (b)(3)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-10\">We have stated that \u201cit is not unreasonable to require a refugee who has an internal resettlement alternative in his own country to ... establish that such an option is unavailable.\u201d <em>Mazariegos v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>241 F.3d 1320, 1327 (11th Cir. 2001). Furthermore, we found reversible error when the BIA failed to mention the factors of 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1208.13(b)(3) in making its determination of whether internal relocation was reasonable. <em>Arboleda v. U.S. Atty. Gen., </em>434 F.3d 1220, 1226 (11th Cir .2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b522-11\">In the instant case, the BIA concluded that no past persecution existed. Therefore, the burden was on Melgarejo-Sandoval to establish that it was unreasonable for him to relocate, and he offered insufficient evidence to this effect, testifying only that the guerrillas would find him in any part of Colombia. The IJ noted in his decision that Melgarejo-Sandoval\u2019s mother and two sisters continued to live in Bogota, Colombia, without government protection. The IJ also stated that the FARC operated roadblocks throughout the country, but Melgarejo-Sandoval failed to offer evidence of any persecution or threats of persecution by the FARC. Thus, he failed to meet his burden when he presented only vague testimony and relied on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>Country Report. <em>See Arboleda, </em>434 F.3d at 1224 (finding that the DHS\u2019s submission of two country reports and an asylum profile was insufficient to meet its burden).</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">Furthermore, Melgarejo-Sandoval\u2019s inability to establish that any past persecution or fear of future persecution was because of a protected ground is fatal to his asylum claim. <em>See Sepulveda, </em>401 F.3d at 1232 n. 7. Therefore, even if the IJ failed to properly analyze the relocation factors, the error was harmless. <em>(Id.).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">Because substantial evidence supported the BIA\u2019s conclusion that Melgarejo-Sandoval did not meet his burden of proving that internal relocation was unreasonable and because any failure by the BIA to apply the reasonableness factors was harmless error, the BIA did not err when it determined that internal relocation was reasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-7\">Upon review of the record and consideration of the parties\u2019 briefs, we find no reversible error. Accordingly, we deny the petitioners\u2019 petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-8\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
