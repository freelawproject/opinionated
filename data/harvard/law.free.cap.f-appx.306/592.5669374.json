We <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b614-22\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b614-23\">Mr. Lazaro unsuccessfully applied for several positions within the Department of Veterans Affairs (\u201cDVA\u201d) in 2006. After his attempts proved to be ineffective, Mr. Lazaro began to consider whether his failure to obtain the employment he sought might have been attributable to the fact that his employment file failed to reflect that he was entitled to veterans\u2019 preference status under 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3304(f). In an effort to have his employment file corrected, Mr. Lazaro filed a complaint, pursuant to 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3330a, with the Veterans\u2019 Employment and Training Service \u25a0within the Department of Labor. In that filing, he argued that he was a military veteran and that his form SF-50-B was incorrect in that it did not award him a five-point veterans\u2019 preference. A year later, when his veterans\u2019 preference status had still not been updated to reflect his military service, Mr. Lazaro appealed to the Merit Systems Protection Board pursuant to <em>5 </em>U.S.C. \u00a7 3330a(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b614-24\">In the course of the appeal, Mr. Lazaro explained to the administrative judge assigned to the case that he had applied for Position Number MP-06-150-AC-IT Specialist GS7-9 and that his nonselection for that position led him to inquire why his veterans\u2019 preference status was not reflected on his Form SF-50 and in his records with the DVA. Mr. Lazaro explained that he was not seeking redress of his nonselection for that particular IT Specialist position but simply wanted to have his veterans\u2019 preference status updated.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"593\">*593</page-number>In January 2008, the agency updated Mr. Lazaro\u2019s veterans\u2019 preference status to reflect a five-point preference and informed both Mr. Lazaro and the Board of the change. After that step was taken, Mr. Lazaro agreed to withdraw his appeal, and the administrative judge entered an order formally dismissing the appeal. However, in the opening sentence of the order dismissing the appeal, the administrative judge stated that the appeal arose from an allegation \u201cthat the agency violated his veterans\u2019 preference rights by not selecting him for a position as a GS-7/9 Information Technologist Specialist under Vacancy Announcement No. MP-06-150AC-IT.\u201d Mr. Lazaro objected to that characterization, claiming that the only issue in the case had been his entitlement to the five-point veterans\u2019 preference and that he had not alleged that the agency violated his rights by not selecting him for the Information Technologist Specialist position. Mr. Lazaro petitioned the full Board for review of the administrative judge\u2019s initial decision, asking the Board to \u201ccorrect the record in this case to reflect that the appellant agreed to drop his appeal regarding his entitlement to a five point Veterans\u2019 preference which was the only issue before the Board.\u201d The DVA responded that it did \u201cnot object to the Initial Decision being amended to reflect that Appellant filed his appeal alleging violation of his veterans\u2019 preference rights\u201d and that it was \u201camenable to an amendment of the Initial Decision, to correct what appears to be a clerical error.\u201d In response to the petition, the full Board found that there was neither new information presented nor any legal error in the administrative judge\u2019s initial decision and therefore denied Mr. Lazaro\u2019s petition for review. Mr. Lazaro petitions for review by this court.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b615-6\">Mr. Lazaro does not allege that the Board failed to take into account any facts, applied the wrong law, failed to consider any ground for relief, or committed legal error. Instead, he comes to this court in an attempt to have the \u201cAdministrative Judge\u2019s initial decision ... amended to reflect that the Appellant filed the appeal alleging violation of his Veterans\u2019 Preference rights.\u201d Mr. Lazaro notes that he had advised the administrative judge that he was not appealing from the agency\u2019s decision not to select him for the position that was the subject of a particular vacancy announcement, but instead was appealing from the agency\u2019s refusal to recognize his veterans\u2019 preference rights in general. We agree with Mr. Lazaro that the gravamen of his claim was that he was entitled to a five-point veterans\u2019 preference. The administrative judge\u2019s characterization of his appeal as \u201calleging that the agency violated his veterans\u2019 preference rights by not selecting him for a position as a GS-7/9 Information Technologist Specialist under Vacancy Announcement No. MP-06-150AC-IT\u201d is at minimum too narrow. While Mr. Lazaro referred to his nonselection for that position in the course of the proceeding before the administrative judge, his submissions in that proceeding make clear that his appeal was broader in scope than that and focused on the veterans\u2019 preference issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b615-7\">While it is unclear how the administrative judge\u2019s characterization of his claim on appeal could have any prejudicial effect on Mr. Lazaro in the future, we take this occasion to obviate that risk by clarifying that Mr. Lazaro\u2019s claim was directed to the failure to recognize his veterans\u2019 preference rights, not as directed at a single particular hiring decision. With that clarification, and in light of agency\u2019s agreement to recognize Mr. Lazaro\u2019s veterans\u2019 prefer<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"594\">*594</page-number>ence rights, we see no need to direct any further proceedings in this case. The Board\u2019s order dismissing the appeal is affirmed.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
