The Honorable David S. Doty, United States Senior District Judge for the District of Minnesota.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<author id=\"b371-9\">PER CURIAM.</author>\n<p id=\"b371-10\">Frank Waters, Jr., pled guilty to one count of Possession of a Stolen Firearm, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(j). The district court<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> sentenced him to 112 months and eight days imprisonment. Waters appeals, claiming sentencing error. Jurisdiction being proper under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742, this court affirms.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-11\">Waters burglarized a home, stealing numerous firearms. The presentence investigation report determined that his total offense level was 29 based upon: 1) a base offense level of 24 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2); 2) a two-level increase for the number of firearms; 3) a two-level increase for possessing stolen firearms; 4) a four-level increase for firearm possession in connection with another felony \u2014 burglary; and 5) a three-level deduction for acceptance of responsibility. Waters\u2019s guideline range was 140 to 175 months, but under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(c)(l), his range became 120 months due to the statutory maximum. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(a)(2) (maximum sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(j) is 10 years). Waters was sentenced to 112 months and eight days imprisonment, after credit for nearly eight months of time served on a state conviction for the same conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b371-15\">Waters argues that his sentence was unreasonable because the court\u2019s two-level increase under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4) for possessing stolen firearms is already incorporated in the base offense level for violating \u00a7 922(j). This court reviews de novo the district court\u2019s construction and application of the Sentencing Guidelines, and reviews for clear error any factual findings regarding enhancements. <em>United States v. Wintermute, </em>443 F.3d 993, 1004 (8th Cir. 2006). This court reviews sentencing decisions for an abuse of discretion. <em>See United States v. Garcia, </em>512 F.3d 1004, 1006 (8th Cir.2008), <em>citing Gall v. United States, </em>- U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). A sentence within the guidelines range is presumptively reasonable on appeal. <em>Id., citing Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b371-18\">Waters does not dispute that U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4) was properly applied. An enhancement under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4) does not impermissibly \u201cdouble count\u201d by applying a two-level increase to a defendant\u2019s sentence because the firearms were stolen. <em>See United States v. Hawkins, </em>181 F.3d 911, 912 (8th Cir.1999) (\u201cBy necessary implication ... two levels must be added if any firearm was stolen or had an altered serial number, unless the base level is determined under subsection (a)(7).\u201d) (internal quotation omitted); <em>see also United States v. Kenney, </em>283 F.3d 934, 938 (8th Cir.2002) (holding that the district court \u201cdid not impermissibly double count\u201d in applying a two-level enhance<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"350\">*350</page-number>ment under \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(4) where defendant possessed stolen firearms).</p>\n<p id=\"b372-4\">Waters also claims that the four-level enhancement under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.1(b)(6) for possessing firearms in connection with a burglary over-represents the seriousness of the offense. This court has upheld the enhancement where firearms were stolen during a burglary. <em>See id. </em>(affirming a sentence applying a four-level enhancement for the burglary of firearms). The district court did not abuse its discretion when sentencing Waters.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-6\">The judgment of the district court is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b371-19\">.
