EBEL, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b431-30\">Defendant-Appellant Saul Garcia Macias pled guilty to (1) violating 21 U.S.C. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>\u00a7 841(a)(1), possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance, (2) violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1546(1), possession of a false' immigration document, and (3) violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A, aggravated identity theft.Macias now appeals, raising issues with respect to his sentence as well as the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress. Macias\u2019s counsel filed a brief pursuant to <em>Anders v. California, </em>386 U.S. 738, 87 S.Ct. 1396, 18 L.Ed.2d 493 (1967), and moved for leave to withdraw; Macias submitted a supplemental brief in response to the <em>Anders </em>brief which argued ineffective assistance of trial counsel and request-, ed appointment of new counsel. Having thoroughly reviewed the record and considered each brief, we grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw, deny Macias\u2019s request for appointment of new counsel, and affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-4\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b432-5\">As stipulated in Macias\u2019s plea agreement, the conduct giving rise to his indictment occurred on February 2, 2006. On that date, Macias and his codefendant Jacqueline Fodness were driving his truck, with approximately six pounds of methamphetamine hidden within a secret compartment in the vehicle, from Los Angeles to Sioux Falls, South Dakota. At the time of Macias\u2019s arrest, in Utah en route, Macias was found in possession of the methamphetamine as well as a green card which had previously been issued to another individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-6\">Macias moved to suppress all of the evidence that the government had obtained against him from the search of his truck. The motion was referred to a magistrate judge pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B), who subsequently held an evidentiary hearing on the motion. The magistrate issued a report and recommendation on November 13, 2006, which recommended that Macias\u2019s motion be denied. Macias did not object to the report and recommendation, which the district court adopted on December 19, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-10\">Thereafter, Macias pled guilty to all three counts in the indictment: (1) violating 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), possession with intent to distribute a controlled substance, (2) violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1546(1), possession of a false immigration document, and (3) violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1028A, aggravated identity theft. Under the terms of the plea, Macias specifically reserved the right to appeal the denial of the motion to suppress.</p>\n<p id=\"b432-13\">Having accepted Macias\u2019s guilty plea, a Presentence Report was prepared, which determined Macias\u2019s total offense level was 35, and his criminal history category to be II. Macias\u2019s total offense level coupled with his criminal history category resulted in a guideline sentence range of 188 to 235 month\u2019s imprisonment. U.S.S.G. (2006). Macias filed a motion requesting the district court to grant a downward departure to the minimum mandatory sentence for his crimes, 144 months. The district court sentenced Macias to 166 months\u2019 imprisonment, 22 months below the guideline range. In so doing, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-14\">This is an interesting case. It\u2019s very rare that somebody just pleads straight up to all the counts, but he did what he did.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b432-15\">I\u2019m going to sentence him to 166 months.... The 166 months is a long time. I think it is correct there is some disparity under 3553 with this defendant <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"411\">*411</page-number>and [his co-defendant] Ms. Fodness [who received a sentence of 120 months],</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ArJ\">Macias now timely appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-6\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b433-7\">In <em>Anders, </em>the Supreme Court held that \u201cif counsel finds his case to be wholly frivolous, after a conscientious examination of it, he should so advise the court and request permission to withdraw.\u201d 386 U.S. at 744, 87 S.Ct. 1396. This court \u201cmust then conduct a full examination of the record to determine whether defendant\u2019s claims are wholly frivolous. If [we] conclude [ ] after such an examination that the appeal is frivolous, [we] may grant counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and may dismiss the appeal.\u201d <em>United States v. Calderon, </em>428 F.3d 928, 930 (10th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b433-8\">Counsel\u2019s brief appears to identify two potential issues for appeal: (1) the district court\u2019s denial of Macias\u2019s motion to suppress, and (2) the reasonableness of Macias\u2019s sentence. In addition to counsel\u2019s brief, Nelson has filed a supplemental brief asserting ineffective assistance of counsel. Each of these matters will be considered in turn.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-9\">A. <em>Motion to Suppress</em></p>\n<p id=\"b433-10\">Macias\u2019s counsel asserts that there is no non-fi'ivolous ground on which Macias may challenge the district court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress. Having engaged in a full examination of the record, as required by <em>Anders, </em>we agree.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-11\">Macias filed a motion to suppress, arguing that the stop and subsequent search of his vehicle violated the Fourth Amendment. Macias\u2019s motion was referred to a magistrate judge, and the magistrate recommended denying the motion in a report and recommendation. Macias did not object to the report and recommendation, and the district court adopted the magistrate\u2019s report. We agree with Macias\u2019s counsel that Macias\u2019s failure to object to the magistrate\u2019s judge\u2019s report and recommendation is fatal to this claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b433-13\">\u201cThis court has adopted a firm waiver rule under which a party who fails to make a timely objection to the magistrate judge\u2019s findings and recommendations waives appellate review of both factual and legal questions.\u201d <em>Morales-Femandez v. I.N.S., </em>418 F.3d 1116,1119 (10th Cir.2005). There are two exceptions to the waiver rule: \u201cwhen (1) a pro se litigant has not been informed of the time period for objecting and consequences of failing to object, or when (2) the \u2018interests of justice\u2019 require review.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The first exception does not apply, because Macias was represented by counsel before the district court and the magistrate\u2019s report warned that a \u201c[fjailure to file objections to factual and legal findings may constitute a waiver of those objections on subsequent appellate review.\u201d The second exception also does not apply. In <em>Morales-Femandez </em>we held that \u201c[i]n many respects, the interests of justice analysis we have developed, which expressly includes review of a litigant\u2019s unobjected-to substantive claims on the merits, is similar to reviewing for plain error,\u201d 418 F.3d at 1120, and that \u201c[a]t a minimum ... our \u2018interest of justice\u2019 standard for determining whether we should excuse a defendant\u2019s failure to object to a magistrate judge\u2019s recommendation includes plain error,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 1122. When there are no mitigating factors regarding a litigant\u2019s failure to object, the \u201cinterest of justice\u201d test requires only analysis for plain error. <em>See Zumwalt v. Astrue, </em>220 Fed.Appx. 770, 778 (10th Cir.2007) (unpublished). Here, there are no mitigating factors regarding Macias\u2019s failure to comply with the requirement to object to the magistrate\u2019s recommendation and report and, therefore, our only concern is plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"412\">*412</page-number>\u201cPlain error occurs when there is (1) error, (2) that is plain, which (3) affects substantial rights, and which (4) seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Morales-Femandez, </em>418 F.3d at 1122-23 (internal quotation marks omitted). \u201c[A]n error is \u2018plain\u2019 if it is clear or obvious at the time of the appeal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1124. Macias argued below that Officer Nick Bowles, the arresting officer, violated his Fourth Amendment rights by conducting both an illegal stop and an illegal search of Macias\u2019s vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-4\">We discern no plain error here. Officer Bowles was initially justified in stopping Macias because he observed Macias\u2019s pick-up truck following the vehicle in front of it too closely, which is a violation of Utah law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See United States v. Bote</em>ro-Ospina, 71 F.3d 783, 787 (10th Cir. 1995). After completing a check on Macias\u2019s license and registration, Officer Bowles issued Macias a warning, returned Macias\u2019s documents and told Macias that he was free to leave. When Macias reached his vehicle, Officer Bowles asked if could talk with Macias, thus turning the situation into a consensual encounter. <em>See United States v. Wallace, </em>429 F.3d 969, 974-75 (10th Cir.2005). After some questioning, Macias proceeded to grant Officer Bowles consent to search the vehicle. Macias contended that Officer Bowles exceeded the scope of that consent when he pulled up the carpet on the floor of the driver\u2019s side of Macias\u2019s truck and then used a crow bar to pry up a steel plate under the driver\u2019s seat, revealing a secret compartment. However, Macias never revoked consent and this court has \u201cupheld ... searches involving the partial dismantling of a vehicle pursuant to general consent when the defendant did not object.\u201d <em>United States v. Gregoire, </em>425 F.3d 872, 880 (10th Cir.2005) (upholding search \u201cthat began with the drilling of two holes in the interior and concluded with a large screwdriver used to pry away a portion of the undercarriage of the vehicle to reveal the contraband\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b434-8\">B. <em>Macias\u2019s Sentence</em></p>\n<p id=\"b434-9\">Macias\u2019s counsel asserts that there is no non-frivolous ground on which Macias may challenge either the procedural or substantive reasonableness of his sentence. Having engaged in a full examination of the record, as required by <em>Anders, </em>we agree. The district court properly calculated Macias\u2019s guideline range sentence and considered Macias\u2019s request for a downward departure, together with the \u00a7 3553(a) sentencing factors, and the uncontested facts in the presentence report. Thereafter the district court sentenced Macias to 22 months less than the advisory guideline range, \u201cdeparting lightly [from the guideline range] under 3553.\u201d The sentence imposed by the district court, which was <em>below </em>the guideline range, is entitled to a presumption of reasonableness when challenged by defendant. <em>See United States v. Contreras-Mireles, </em>299 Fed.Appx. 759, 761-62 (10th Cir.2008). Based on our review of the record, we find no basis on which this presumption can be overcome.</p>\n<p id=\"b434-10\">C. <em>Ineffective Assistance of Counsel</em></p>\n<p id=\"b434-11\">In his pro se filing, Macias argues that his trial counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to object to the magistrate\u2019s report and recommendation on Macias\u2019s motion to suppress. Macias\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel claim is more appropriately brought on collateral <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"413\">*413</page-number>review in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 motion. <em>See United States v. Brooks, </em>438 F.3d 1231, 1242 (10th Cir.2006). \u201cThe purpose of this rule is to ensure that we are provided with a developed factual record of the events.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Therefore, Macias\u2019s claims in this regard are premature.</p>\n<p id=\"b435-5\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b435-6\">Based on the foregoing, we GRANT counsel\u2019s motion to withdraw and DENY Macias\u2019s request for appointment of new counsel. This appeal is DISMISSED, and the judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b431-18\"> After examining the briefs and appellate record, this panel has determined unanimously to grant the parties\u2019 request for a decision on the briefs without oral argument. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(f) and 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"410\">*410</page-number>oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b434-5\">.
