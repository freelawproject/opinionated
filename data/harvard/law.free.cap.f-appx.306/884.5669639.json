Rodriguez-Caltzontzin argues that his sentence is procedurally unreasonable because the district court did not provide adequate reasons for the chosen sentence. Citing <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014\u2014, 128 S.Ct. 558, 574-75, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), and <em>Rita v. United </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"885\">*885</page-number><em>States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2464-65, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007), he also contends that his sentence is not entitled to a presumption of reasonableness because the illegal reentry guideline, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2, is not based on empirical data and national experience. Finally, Rodriguez-Caltzontzin argues that his sentence is substantively unreasonable because it is greater than necessary to meet the sentencing goals of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b907-5\">After <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), sentences are reviewed for \u201creasonableness.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 586, 594, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). An appellate court\u2019s review of a sentence must start with the issue whether the district court committed any \u201csignificant procedural error, such as ... failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 597. If the sentencing decision is procedurally sound, the appellate court then considers \u201cthe substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b907-8\">The district court\u2019s statements at sentencing were adequate to show that it considered Rodriguez-Caltzontzin\u2019s arguments and the pertinent sentencing factors. <em>See Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2468; <em>United States v. Rodriguez, </em>523 F.3d 519, 525-26 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 129 S.Ct. 624, 172 L.Ed.2d 616 (2008). We disagree with Rodriguez\u2019s reading of <em>Kimbrough. </em>The question presented in <em>Kimbrough </em>was whether \u201ca sentence ... outside the guidelines range is per se unreasonable when it is based on a disagreement with the sentencing disparity for crack and powder cocaine offenses.\u201d 128 S.Ct. at 564 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted) (ellipses in original). Speaking specifically to the crack cocaine guidelines, the Court simply ruled that \u201cit would not be an abuse of discretion for a district court to conclude when sentencing a particular defendant that the crack/powder disparity yields a sentence \u2018greater than necessary\u2019 to achieve \u00a7 3553(a)\u2019s purposes, even in a mine-run case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 575. In <em>Kimbrough, </em>the Court said nothing of the applicability of the presumption of reasonableness. Moreover, the appellate presumption\u2019s continued applicability to \u00a7 2L1.2 sentences is supported by our decision in <em>United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338-39 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 129 S.Ct. 328, 172 L.Ed.2d 236 (2008), which involved a similar challenge to \u00a7 2L1.2. The appellate presumption is therefore applicable in this case. After reviewing for procedural errors and considering the substantive reasonableness of the sentence, we conclude that Rodriguez-Caltzontzin has failed to rebut the presumption of reasonableness.</p>\n<p id=\"b907-14\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b906-7\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
