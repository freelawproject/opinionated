For the reasons that follow, we will affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-12\">Because we write primarily for the parties, it is not necessary to recite the facts or history of this case except insofar as may be helpful to our brief discussion. The guideline range for the two Grade C violations Purnell admitted was 8-14 months. The maximum statutory penalty was two years. On appeal, Purnell argues that the district court\u2019s sentence of 20 months incarceration was unreasonable because it was wholly punitive, disregarded his need for treatment, and ignored the sentencing factors set forth in Section 3558(a). We disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-13\">In <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007), <em>Id. </em>at 597. The Supreme Court clarified that we must first ensure that the district court \u201ccommitted no significant procedural error, such as ... failing to consider the 3553(a) factors ...\u201d <em>Id. </em>Absent any procedural error, we must \u201cconsider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under the abuse-of-discretion standard,\u201d taking into account the totality of the circumstances. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b815-16\">The district court is required to consider each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and \u201cset forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decision making authority.\u201d <em>United States v. Lessner, </em>498 F.3d 185, 203 (3d Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2468, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b815-17\">The record shows that the district court considered Purnell\u2019s criminal history and the seriousness of the underlying violation. <em>See. </em>App. 29-30. Despite Purnell\u2019s argument to the contrary, the court also considered his need for drug treatment. Understandably, the court discounted the value of treatment noting that Purnell had frustrated earlier \u201ctrusting and generous\u201d efforts at rehabilitation with \u201ccalculated deception.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 30.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-18\">Purnell also argues that the trial court did not reasonably apply the 3553(a) factors because the sentence exceeds the advisory Guideline range. That argument is frivolous.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-19\">Given Purnell\u2019s repeated infractions, and his repeated attempts to deceive his probation officers, drug counselors and the court, as well as the number of times he failed supervised release, the court acted quite reasonably in imposing a sentence that exceeded the recommended range.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-20\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b815-21\">For all of the above reasons, we will affirm the district court\u2019s sentence.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
