Both the Board of Immigration Appeals and immigration judge denied Joseph\u2019s applications based on a finding that Joseph was not credible. We deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b517-23\">We review credibility determinations under the substantial evidence test. <em>Chen v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>463 F.3d 1228, 1230-31 (11th Cir.2006). Adverse credibility findings will be reversed \u201c \u2018only if the evidence \u201ccompels\u201d a reasonable fact finder to find otherwise.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1231 (quoting <em>Sepulveda v. U.S. Att\u2019y Gen., </em>401 F.3d 1226, 1230 (11th Cir.2005)). An adverse credibility determination may be based on inconsistencies, inaccuracies, and falsehoods in the applicant\u2019s oral and written statements. 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(b)(l)(B)(iii).</p>\n<p id=\"b517-24\">Substantial evidence supports the finding that Joseph was not credible, <em>see Al Najjar v. Ashcroft, </em>257 F.3d 1262, 1283-84 (11th Cir.2001), and the immigration judge <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"496\">*496</page-number>and Board provided specific and cogent reasons to support that finding. <em>Chen, </em>463 F.3d at 1231. There were several inconsistencies between Joseph\u2019s application for asylum and his testimony. Joseph omitted from his original application for asylum that he fled Haiti after he was severely beaten with bats and a razor-tailed whip. Joseph wrote in his application that he was \u201cvery unpopular\u201d with supporters of the Mochrena party in Haiti, but Joseph testified at his removal hearing that he was popular among supporters of the party. Joseph also made inconsistent statements at his removal hearing regarding the failure of his wife to testify on his behalf and the location of a letter allegedly written by his employer that had warned Joseph to leave Haiti. Joseph offers no explanation for his inconsistencies that would \u201c \u2018compel\u2019 a reasonable fact finder\u201d to reverse the adverse credibility finding and conclude that he established eligibility for asylum and withholding of removal. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b518-4\">Joseph\u2019s petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b518-5\">PETITION DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
