Hall, entitled to an award of benefits pursuant to the Black Lung Benefits Act, 30 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 901-45. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">Bertha Hall Smith applied for survivor benefits pursuant to the Black Lung Benefits Act, 30 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 901-45 (the Act) on February 23, 2001 after her husband Herbert B. Hall\u2019s death. Hall was exposed to coal dust while working as a coal miner for Johnson Coal Company from October 1958 to July 4, 1988. He also smoked one pack of cigarettes per day for 37 years.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">Hall died on December 26, 2000 at the age of 60. Hall\u2019s treating physician \u2014 Dr. Koura \u2014 attributed his death to \u201cemphysema due to arterial insufficiency\u201d and \u201cblockage due to coal worker\u2019s pneumoconiosis.\u201d By contrast, Johnson Coal\u2019s experts \u2014 Drs. Westerfield and Caffrey\u2014 opined that simple coal worker\u2019s pneumoconiosis did not cause or contribute to Hall\u2019s death. Instead, they found that his tobacco use did.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">On August 8, 2006, the Administrative Law Judge found that pneumoconiosis caused Hall\u2019s death, and awarded surviv- or\u2019s benefits to Smith and her son pursuant to 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 718.205(c)(2). In so finding, the ALJ credited Koura\u2019s medical opinions and record of treating Hall for pneumoconiosis. The ALJ discredited Westerfield\u2019s and Caffrey\u2019s medical opinions in their entirety, finding that they were \u201ccontrary to the spirit of the Act\u201d because they expressly denied that simple pneumoconiosis could cause death.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-8\">On appeal, the Benefits Review Board affirmed. The Board held that substantial evidence \u2014 namely, Koura\u2019s opinions \u2014 supported the ALJ\u2019s decision to grant benefits. The Board also held that the ALJ properly discredited Westerfield\u2019s and Caffrey\u2019s medical opinions.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-10\">This petition followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-11\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-12\">Our review is limited to whether substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s conclusions. <em>See Gray v. SLC Coal Co., </em>176 F.3d 382, 387 (6th Cir.1999). Johnson Coal contends that substantial evidence does not support the ALJ\u2019s decision to grant benefits, because Koura provided no reasoning for his opinions. Whether a physician\u2019s opinion is sufficiently reasoned, however, is a matter of credibility. <em>See Peabody Coal Co. v. Groves, </em>277 F.3d 829, 836 (6th Cir.2002). And our court has expressly held that we lack authority to revisit an ALJ\u2019s credibility determinations in cases under the Act. <em>Id. </em>We also note that Koura did explain that pneumoconiosis caused Hall\u2019s death through \u201cblockage.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b246-13\">We are constrained to hold, therefore, that the ALJ\u2019s decision was supported by substantial evidence. And given that holding, we regard Johnson Coal\u2019s remaining argument concerning the Westerfield and Caffrey opinions as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-14\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-15\">For these reasons, we affirm.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
