The EEOC alleges that Defendant Serrano\u2019s Mexican Restaurants, LLC failed to reasonably accommodate former restaurant manager Terra Naeve\u2019s sincere religious beliefs. A jury determined that Serrano\u2019s did reasonably accommodate Naeve. The EEOC asserts that the jury\u2019s determination was against the clear weight of the evidence and, therefore, the district court\u2019s initial order granting a new trial on that basis was proper and reconsideration of that order erroneous. \u201cWe review for abuse of discretion a district judge\u2019s decision to reconsider an interlocutory order by another judge of the same court.\u201d <em>Amarel v. Connell, </em>102 F.3d 1494, 1515 (9th Cir.1996). We also review for abuse of discretion the decision to grant or deny a motion for new trial on the grounds that the verdict is against the clear weight of the evidence. <em>Landes Constr. Co., Inc. v. Royal Bank of Can., </em>833 F.2d 1365, 1372 (9th Cir.1987). We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b429-13\">The district court was not barred by the law of the case from reconsidering its prior order despite the reassignment of the case to a different judge. The law of the case is a guide to courts\u2019 exercise of discretion, rather than a rigid rule. <em>See Tahoe-Sierra Pres. Council, Inc. v. Tahoe Reg\u00ed Planning Agency, </em>216 F.3d 764, 787 (9th Cir.2000); <em>United States v. Miller, </em>822 F.2d 828, 832-33 (9th Cir.1987); <em>Castner v. First Nat\u2019l Bank of Anchorage, </em>278 F.2d 376, 379-80 (9th Cir.1960). There is no strict prohibition against one district judge reconsidering and overturning the interlocutory order or ruling of a prior district judge in the same case before final judgment, though \u201cone judge should not overrule another except for the most cogent reasons.\u201d <em>United States v. Desert Gold Min. Co., </em>433 F.2d 713, 715 (9th Cir.1970); <em>see also, e.g., Abada v. Charles Schwab &amp; Co., Inc., </em>300 F.3d 1112,1117-18 (9th Cir.2002); <em>Fairbank v. Wunderman Cato Johnson, </em>212 F.3d 528, 530 (9th Cir. 2000). Cogent reasons include a determination that a prior order was clearly erroneous and would result in a \u201cuseless trial.\u201d <em>Costner, </em>278 F.2d at 380; <em>see also Delta Sav. Bank v. United States, </em>265 F.3d 1017, 1027 (9th Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b429-14\">The district court exercised its discretion to reconsider the prior grant of a new trial because it found the prior order to be clear error requiring an unnecessary second trial.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> After carefully reviewing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"408\">*408</page-number>the record, we do not find this was an abuse of discretion. A new trial may be granted following a jury verdict pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59 only \u201cif the verdict is against the clear weight of the evidence.\u201d <em>Landes, </em>833 F.2d at 1371. At trial, conflicting testimony was presented by Naeve and Ric Serrano regarding whether Serrano\u2019s made an unconditional offer of a transfer to another store location to Naeve, which the EEOC concedes would have constituted a full accommodation. Though the EEOC attempted to impeach Ric Serrano, we do not find the impeachment to have been sufficiently serious to render his testimony substantially less believable than Naeve\u2019s. The parties also put forward on appeal conflicting interpretations of Ric Serrano\u2019s testimony concerning the basis on which his offer was rejected. The court does not find the EEOC\u2019s interpretation to be significantly more plausible than that offered by Serrano\u2019s. Therefore, we agree with the district court\u2019s final determination that the clear weight of the evidence does not support a finding that no unconditional accommodation was offered,</p>\n<p id=\"AmW\">AFFIRMED</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b429-15\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
