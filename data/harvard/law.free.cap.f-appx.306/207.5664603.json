(\u201cTaylor\u201d) sued Defendant Medical Mutual Services LLC (\u201cMedical Mutual\u201d) in Ohio state court, alleging breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and other state law claims. Medical Mutual removed the suit to federal district court, contending that Taylor\u2019s claims were completely preempted by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\u201cERISA\u201d), 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1001 <em>et seq. </em>The district court granted Taylor\u2019s motion to remand to state court, as well as Taylor\u2019s subsequent request, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c), for attorneys\u2019 fees and costs incurred as a result of the removal. On appeal, Medical Mutual challenges the award of attorneys\u2019 fees and costs to Taylor. Because the district court did not abuse its discretion in this matter, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-22\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b229-23\">In March 2003, Taylor created a self-funded health benefit plan (the \u201cPlan\u201d) for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>the purpose of providing medical benefits to its eligible employees and their dependents. The parties do not dispute that the Plan was an employee welfare benefit plan established and maintained in accordance with ERISA.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-4\">From March 2003 to 2005, Taylor and Medical Mutual entered into a series of administrative services agreements. Under the terms of these agreements, Taylor was obligated to establish the Plan, prepare a governing Plan document, and prepare and distribute a summary Plan description. Taylor was also financially liable for claims incurred by the Plan\u2019s participants and beneficiaries, or, as the Plan defined them, \u201cCovered Persons.\u201d Medical Mutual was to act as third-party administrator of the Plan. Among other things, Medical Mutual was required to receive and process claims for benefits and to disburse payments under the Plan. Upon payment of a claim, Medical Mutual would send Taylor a weekly invoice of the amounts expended. The agreements required Taylor to pay the invoiced amounts on the next business day following the date of the invoice.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">Taylor was also party to an excess loss reinsurance contract with American National Insurance Company (\u201cAmerican National\u201d) to protect itself from catastrophic financial loss. Although Taylor was still required to reimburse Medical Mutual for the entire amount of approved medical claims, Taylor was entitled to reimbursement from American National for any claims Taylor paid on behalf of a single Covered Person in excess of $50,000. To ensure that Taylor was reimbursed under its contract with American National, Taylor claims Medical Mutual was required to timely notify American National of any excess amount.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">On December 12, 2006, Taylor sued Medical Mutual in the Court of Common Pleas of Fairfield County, Ohio, alleging breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, negligence, unjust enrichment, fraud, and bad faith under Ohio law. Taylor\u2019s claims were based on two factual allegations. First, Taylor contended that Medical Mutual breached its duty to timely notify American National that Taylor had incurred costs of claims in excess of the $50,000 individual excess amount for at least four Covered Persons. Due to this alleged failure to notify, Taylor claimed American National had refused to pay Taylor $40,347.70 in reimbursement benefits that would have been covered by the reinsurance contract. Second, Taylor claimed that it had inadvertently made a double payment on a $50,031.13 invoice from Medical Mutual. Medical Mutual apparently applied the initial payment to the amount due and retained the second (double) payment in an account. It used the funds from this account to pay claims that became due under Taylor\u2019s former self-insured plan.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Taylor claimed that Medical Mutual breached its duty to inform Taylor of this overpayment for approximately one year, and accordingly owed Taylor $2,587.91 in interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">On January 25, 2007, Medical Mutual removed the case to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio. As the basis for removal, Medical Mutual claimed that the federal district court had subject matter jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331 because ERISA completely . preempted Taylor\u2019s state law claims. Taylor filed a motion to remand the case to state court, which the district court granted. The district court reasoned that ERISA did not completely preempt <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>Taylor\u2019s state law claims, because Taylor would have lacked standing to sue under ERISA\u2019s civil enforcement provision, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-5\">After its motion to remand was granted, Taylor filed a motion seeking attorneys\u2019 fees and costs under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c). The district court granted that motion as well, concluding that Medical Mutual had no objectively reasonable basis for removal. The parties stipulated to the amount of attorneys\u2019 fees Taylor had incurred, and the district court entered a final order awarding the fees. Medical Mutual timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-6\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b231-7\">Generally, a defendant may remove a civil case commenced in state court to federal district court if the case could have been brought there originally. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441(a). But \u201c[i]f at any time before final judgment it appears that the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the case shall be remanded.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(c). \u201cAn order remanding the case may require payment of just costs and any actual expenses, including attorney fees, incurred as a result of the removal.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Although \u201c[a]n order remanding a case to the State court from which it was removed is not reviewable on appeal or otherwise,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1447(d), we have jurisdiction to review a district court\u2019s decision whether to award attorneys\u2019 fees incurred as a result of improper removal under \u00a7 1447(c), <em>Stallworth v. Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Auth., </em>105 F.3d 252, 255 (6th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-8\">We review a district court\u2019s decision to award attorneys\u2019 fees under \u00a7 1447(c) for abuse of discretion. <em>Bartholomew v. Town of Collierville, </em>409 F.3d 684, 686 (6th Cir. 2005). A district court abuses its discretion when it relies on clearly erroneous findings of fact, improperly applies the law, or uses an erroneous legal standard. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b231-11\">The Supreme Court recently clarified the legal standard governing a district court\u2019s discretion in granting attorneys\u2019 fees under \u00a7 1447(c). \u201cAbsent unusual circumstances, courts may award attorney\u2019s fees under \u00a7 1447(c) only where the removing party lacked an objectively reasonable basis for seeking removal.\u201d <em>Martin v. Franklin Capital Corp., </em>546 U.S. 132, 141, 126 S.Ct. 704, 163 L.Ed.2d 547 (2005). \u201cConversely, when an objectively reasonable basis exists, fees should be denied.\u201d <em>Id.; see also Bartholomew, </em>409 F.3d at 687 (\u201c[A]n award of costs, including attorney fees, is inappropriate where the defendant\u2019s attempt to remove the action was \u2018fairly supportable,\u2019 or where there has not been at least <em>some </em>finding of fault with the defendant\u2019s decision to remove.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b231-12\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"b231-13\">Applying the standard set forth in Morir\u00e1, we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorneys\u2019 fees to Taylor under \u00a7 1447(c). A defendant may remove a state court action under \u00a7 1441(a) only if the action \u201coriginally could have been filed in federal court.\u201d <em>Caterpillar Inc. v. Williams, </em>482 U.S. 386, 392, 107 S.Ct. 2425, 96 L.Ed.2d 318 (1987). Although a civil action \u201carising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States\u201d may be brought originally in federal court, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331, Medical Mutual lacked an objectively reasonable basis for believing that Taylor\u2019s entirely state law complaint raised a federal question.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b232-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number>A. Federal Question Jurisdiction and ERISA Complete Preemption</p>\n<p id=\"b232-4\">Generally, a cause of action arises under federal law only when it appears on the face of the plaintiffs well-pleaded complaint. <em>Metro. Life Ins. Co. v. Taylor, </em>481 U.S. 58, 63, 107 S.Ct. 1542, 95 L.Ed.2d 55 (1987); <em>see also Franchise Tax Bd. v. Constr. Laborers Vacation Trust, </em>463 U.S. 1, 10-11, 103 S.Ct. 2841, 77 L.Ed.2d 420 (1983); <em>Gentek Bldg. Prods., Inc. v. Steel Peel Litig. Trust, </em>491 F.3d 320, 325 (6th Cir.2007). \u201cIf the complaint relies only on state law, the district court generally lacks subject matter jurisdiction, and the action is not removable.\u201d <em>Gentek, </em>491 F.3d at 325. A claim in which a federal question arises only as a defense to a state law action does not \u201carise under\u201d federal law. <em>See Franchise Tax Bd., </em>463 U.S. at 10-11, 103 S.Ct. 2841. Accordingly, because a defendant must ordinarily raise federal conflict preemption as a defense to the allegations in a plaintiffs complaint, it usually cannot serve as a basis for removal to federal court. <em>Caterpillar, </em>482 U.S. at 392-93, 107 S.Ct. 2425 (1987); <em>Metro. Life, </em>481 U.S. at 63,107 S.Ct. 1542.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-5\">The Supreme Court has developed two limited exceptions to the well-pleaded complaint rule: the complete preemption doctrine and the substantial federal question doctrine.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Complete preemption arises where Congress has so completely preempted a particular area \u201cthat any civil complaint raising this select group of claims is necessarily federal in character.\u201d <em>Metro. Life, </em>481 U.S. at 63-64, 107 S.Ct. 1542. In such cases, the plaintiff has essentially \u201cbrought a mislabeled federal claim.\u201d <em>King v. Marriott Int\u2019l, Inc., </em>337 F.3d 421, 425 (4th Cir.2003). The state law claims are converted into federal claims and, as such, may be removed to federal court. <em>Gentek, </em>491 F.3d at 325.</p>\n<p id=\"b232-11\">ERISA is one of the few statutes where both conflict and complete preemption may arise.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> ERISA preempts \u201cany and all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan.\u201d<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1144(a). But, as discussed above, the mere fact that a party may raise ERISA conflict preemption under \u00a7 1144(a) as a defense does not confer federal jurisdiction or authorize removal to federal court. <em>Warner v. Ford Motor Co., </em>46 F.3d 531, 534-35 (6th Cir.1995) (en banc) (noting that no removal jurisdiction exists under \u00a7 1144). A state law claim is not completely preempted or removable unless it falls within the scope of ERISA\u2019s civil enforcement provision \u2014 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a). <em>See Metro. Life, </em>481 U.S. at 67, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>107 S.Ct. 1542 (holding that ERISA completely preempted a state cause of action within the scope of \u00a7 1132(a)(1)(B)); <em>Aetna Health Inc. v. Davila, </em>542 U.S. 200, 209, 124 S.Ct. 2488, 159 L.Ed.2d 312 (2004) (noting that causes of action within the scope of \u00a7 1132(a) are removable); <em>Thurman v. Pfizer, Inc., </em>484 F.3d 855, 860 (6th Cir.2007) (\u201cActions that could have been brought under \u00a7 1132 ... are completely preempted by [ERISA].\u201d); <em>Smith v. Provident Bank, </em>170 F.3d 609, 613 (6th Cir. 1999) (holding that \u201c[a] claim for breach of fiduciary duty against the fiduciary of an ERISA plan\u201d under \u00a7 1132(a)(2) may be removed to federal court); <em>see also Sonoco Prods. Co. v. Physicians Health Plan, Inc., </em>338 F.3d 366, 371 (4th Cir.2003); <em>Toumajian v. Frailey, </em>135 F.3d 648, 654 (9th Cir.1998); <em>Rice v. Panchal, </em>65 F.3d 637, 639 (7th Cir.1995); <em>Dukes v. U.S. Healthcare, Inc., </em>57 F.3d 350, 354 (3d Cir. 1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b233-5\">B. Reasonableness of Removal on the Basis of Complete Preemption</p>\n<p id=\"b233-6\">To have an objectively reasonable basis for removal to federal court, Medical Mutual must have reasonably concluded that Taylor\u2019s claims fell within the scope of ERISA\u2019s civil enforcement provision, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1132(a). Such a conclusion obviously could not have been based upon any explicit reference to ERISA \u2014 on its face, Taylor\u2019s complaint referred only to violations of state law. Instead, Medical Mutual\u2019s argument centers on Taylor\u2019s state law cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty, in which Taylor alleged the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"Adi\">Given the relationship between the parties in this matter, Defendant Medical Mutual owed Plaintiff Taylor certain fiduciary duties arising under state law. The acts and omissions of the Defendant constitute breach of those fiduciary duties for which Defendant has liability. As a direct and proximate result of the breach of fiduciary duties, Defendant [sic] has been damaged, as set forth above.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b233-9\">Compl. If 13, J.A. at 15. Medical Mutual argues that this state law fiduciary duty claim arose under \u00a7 1132(a)(2), the subsection of ERISA\u2019s civil enforcement provision that authorizes \u201cthe Secretary\u201d or \u201ca participant, beneficiary or fiduciary\u201d to sue another fiduciary for breach of fiduciary duty.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b233-10\">Medical Mutual first argues that any claim by Taylor for breach of fiduciary duty must have arisen under \u00a7 1132(a)(2) because a fiduciary duty claim brought under state law would have been meritless. Because Medical Mutual had no fiduciary relationship with Taylor under Ohio law, it argues, it was reasonable in assuming that Taylor\u2019s complaint asserted a fiduciary duty claim under ERISA. But the supposed absence of such a cause of action under state law (a matter on which we express no opinion), standing alone, was not enough to provide a reasonable basis for assuming that the complaint stated a cause of action under ERISA. Medical Mutual needed an affirmative basis for such a conclusion.</p>\n<p id=\"b233-11\">Ultimately, Medical Mutual lacked an objectively reasonable basis for believing that Taylor\u2019s cause of action fell within the scope of \u00a7 1132(a)(2) and was therefore completely preempted by ERISA. As stated above, \u00a7 1132(a)(2) authorizes \u201cthe Secretary\u201d or a \u201cparticipant, beneficiary or fiduciary\u201d to sue another fiduciary for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"212\">*212</page-number>breach of fiduciary duty. The parties do not dispute that Taylor, as employer and Plan sponsor, could not have reasonably been characterized as a \u201cparticipant\u201d or \u201cbeneficiary\u201d within the meaning of ERISA.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> <em>See Cob Clearinghouse Corp. v. Aetna U.S. Healthcare, Inc., </em>362 F.3d 877, 881 n. 5 (6th Cir.2004); <em>Sonoco, </em>338 F.3d at 372 n. 8 (noting that \u201can employer can neither be a participant nor a beneficiary\u201d). And clearly, Taylor did not bring its claim as the Secretary of Labor. Thus, the only capacity in which Taylor could have had standing to sue was in its capacity as a \u201cfiduciary\u201d of the Plan.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-4\">A person is a fiduciary with respect to an ERISA plan to the extent that \u201c(i) he exercises any discretionary authority or discretionary control respecting management of such plan or exercises any authority or control respecting management or disposition of its assets, ... or (iii) he has any discretionary authority or discretionary responsibility in the administration of such plan.\u201d 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(21)(A). \u201c[0]nly discretionary acts of plan management or administration, or those acts designed to carry out the very purposes of the plan,\u201d are acts of a fiduciary capacity. <em>Hunter v. Caliber Sys., Inc., </em>220 F.3d 702, 718 (6th Cir.2000); <em>see also </em>29 U.S.C. \u00a7 1002(21)(A). Moreover, a party\u2019s status as a fiduciary \u201cis not an all or nothing concept\u201d; a court must ask whether an entity is a fiduciary \u201cwith respect to the particular activity in question.\u201d <em>Briscoe v. Fine, </em>444 F.3d 478, 486 (6th Cir.2006) (quoting <em>Moench v. Robertson, </em>62 F.3d <em>553, </em>561 (3d Cir.1995)).</p>\n<p id=\"b234-5\">Here, Taylor\u2019s complaint neither implied that Taylor was suing in its capacity as an ERISA fiduciary nor that Medical Mutual was being sued in its capacity as such. Rather, the relationship between Taylor and Medical Mutual was independent from any duties either party had to the Plan or its participants and beneficiaries. Taylor\u2019s claims related solely to Taylor\u2019s own injuries \u2014 not any injury to the Plan or its participants and beneficiaries \u2014 and Taylor was clearly seeking to enforce its rights under a separate, distinct administrative services contract with Medical Mutual. <em>See Sonoco, </em>338 F.3d at 373 (holding that where a plan sponsor\u2019s claims \u201crelate solely to its own injuries, and not to its fiduciary responsibilities to the plan or to the plan\u2019s participants and beneficiaries,\u201d it is not acting as a fiduciary under ERISA). Moreover, there was no allegation that Medical Mutual had failed to pay benefits to any participants or beneficiaries of the Plan, or that it had paid any claims in violation of the Plan\u2019s terms. Thus, any failure by Medical Mutual was not a failure to properly carry out its fiduciary duties of processing benefit claims and distributing Plan funds under the terms of the Plan. <em>See Geweke Ford v. St. Joseph\u2019s Omni Preferred Care Inc., </em>130 F.3d 1355, 1359 (9th Cir.1997) (noting that third-party administrator\u2019s \u201calleged failure was to file the claim with [the excess liability insurer] properly and in a timely manner, it was not a failure to administer the Plan\u201d). Even assuming that Medical Mutual had a duty to notify American National of any excess amount or to notify Taylor of its double payment, then, that duty could have only arisen out of the administrative services agreements between the parties and ran only to Taylor.</p>\n<p id=\"b234-11\">Because Taylor\u2019s claim involved neither Taylor\u2019s nor Medical Mutual\u2019s status as an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"213\">*213</page-number>ERISA fiduciary, Medical Mutual could not have reasonably concluded that it fell within the scope of \u00a7 1132(a)(2).<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> Accordingly, the district court did not abuse its discretion in awarding attorneys\u2019 fees and costs to Taylor under \u00a7 1447(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b235-5\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b235-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b230-6\">.

Centerior Energy Corp., </em>501 F.3d 555, 560 (6th Cir.2007) (en banc). Medical Mutual did not assert the substantial federal question doctrine as a basis for removal, and does not argue on appeal that it applies.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b232-8\">. In addition to ERISA, the Supreme Court has found that only two other statutes completely preempt state law: section 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, <em>Avco Corp. v. Aero Lodge No. 735, Int\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Machinists, </em>390 U.S. 557, 560, 88 S.Ct. 1235, 20 L.Ed.2d 126 (1968), and sections 85 and 86 of the National Bank Act, <em>Beneficial Nat\u2019l Bank v.

The Supreme Court recently narrowed the preemptive scope of the \u201crelate to\u201d language of \u00a7 1144(a) in <em>N.Y. State Conference of Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield Plans v. Travelers Ins.
