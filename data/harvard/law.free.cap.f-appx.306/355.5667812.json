We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence, <em>Zehatye v. Gonzales, </em>453 F.3d 1182, 1184-85 (9th Cir.2006), and we grant the petition for review and remand the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-13\">The BIA\u2019s order in this case contains a clear factual error that compromises our review of the decision. In its discussion of petitioner\u2019s past persecution, the decision includes consideration of \u201cthe destruction of her store in May 1998 and the other threatening incidents.\u201d These facts are not part of petitioner\u2019s case. Because it is not clear what facts the BIA considered when denying relief, we remand for the BIA to clarify its opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-14\">On remand, the government is advised to insure the BIA has a complete copy of the administrative record. The copies received by the court are missing pages AR 255-277.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-15\">Based on our conclusion, we decline to reach the remainder of petitioner\u2019s contentions.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-16\">PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b378-11\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
