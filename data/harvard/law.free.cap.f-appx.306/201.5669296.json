His sole defense to the action was that the mortgages were unenforceable because the statute of limitations had run on the underlying notes. For the reasons set forth below, we agree with the district court and AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-25\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b223-26\">This case was brought by the United States of America, acting through the Farmers Home Administration (\u201cFmHA\u201d), now known as the Farm Service Agency. The FmHA seeks to obtain an in rem judgment on the basis of two promissory notes secured by mortgages on Oliver\u2019s property. Within each mortgage, Mr. Oliver:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b223-27\">expressly agree[d] that the Government will not be bound by any present or future States laws ... (b) prohibiting the maintenance of an action for a deficiency judgment or limiting the amount thereof or the time within which such action must be brought [or] (c) prescribing any other statute of limitations.... <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"202\">*202</page-number>Borrower expressly waives the benefit of any such State laws.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b224-5\">There is no dispute that Oliver defaulted on the two notes; he has not made a payment since 1992. The FmHA accelerated the notes in 1997, but did not bring this in rem foreclosure action until 2007. On cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court granted summary judgment for the United States.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-7\">We review de novo the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>XL Specialty Ins. Co. v. Kiewit Offshore Servs., Ltd., </em>513 F.3d 146, 149 (5th Cir.2008); <em>see also </em>Fed.R.Civ.P. 56 (c). Summary judgment is appropriate if the summary judgment evidence shows \u201cthat there is no genuine, issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R. Crv. Proc. 56(c). Neither party contends that there are material fact issues. Instead, they disagree on the applicable law.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-9\">\u201cUnder a nationwide federal loan program like that of [the] FmHA, it is settled that federal law ultimately controls the government\u2019s rights and responsibilities.\u201d <em>Farmers Home Admin, v. Muirhead, </em>42 F.3d 964, 965 (5th Cir.1995) (citing <em>United. States v. Kimbell Foods, Inc., </em>440 U.S. 715, 727, 99 S.Ct. 1448, 59 L.Ed.2d 711 (1979)). In particular, the United States and its agencies are not subject to a statute of limitations unless Congress has provided otherwise. <em>Muirhead, </em>42 F.3d at 967.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-10\">Farm loans are subject to two statutes of limitations: 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2415 and 31. U.S.C. \u00a7 3716, although only \u00a7 2415 is relevant here.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Section 2415(a) reads that \u201cevery action for <em>money damages </em>brought by the United States or an officer or agency thereof which is founded upon any contract express or implied in law or fact, shall be barred unless the complaint is filed within six years after the right of action accrues ...\u201d (emphasis added). Section 2415(c) provides: \u201cNothing herein shall be deemed to limit the time for bringing an action to establish the title to, or right of possession of, real or personal property.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b224-13\">Oliver argues that the six-year statute of limitations under \u00a7 2415(a) applies to the present case, while the FmHA asserts that an in rem foreclosure action is excluded from the six-year statute of limitations under \u00a7 2415(c). This court, as well as every other United States Court of Appeals to consider the question, has concluded that \u00a7 2415(a) does not set a limitations period on mortgage foreclosure actions. <em>Muirhead, </em>42 F.3d at 966-67; <em>Davidson v. FDIC, </em>44 F.3d 246, 248-49 (5th Cir.1995); <em>see also UMLIC VP LLC v. Matthias, </em>364 F.3d 125, 134 (3d Cir.2004); <em>United States v. Omdahl, </em>104 F.3d 1143, 1145-46 (9th Cir.1997); <em>Westnau Land Corp. v. United States Small Bus. Admin., </em>1 F.3d 112, 114-16 (2d Cir.1993); <em>United States v. Ward, </em>985 F.2d 500, 500 (10th Cir.1993); <em>United States v. Alvarado, </em>5 F.3d 1425, 1429 (11th Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b224-14\">In spite of this precedent, Oliver asserts that the FmHA is precluded from foreclosing on his property under <em>Louisiana property law </em>because the FmHA is barred under the <em>federal statute of limitations </em>from asserting any claim for damages on the debt itself. This, court rejected almost identical arguments in <em>Muirhead. See </em>42 F.3d at 966-67.</p>\n<p id=\"b224-15\">Oliver argues that <em>Muirhead </em>involved Mississippi law, which he contends is dif<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"203\">*203</page-number>ferent from Louisiana law at issue here. He claims, \u201cLouisiana provisions do not read like a statute of limitations, and indeed, are not a statute of limitations.\u201d Contrary to Oliver\u2019s arguments, the relevant Louisiana statute functions almost identically to that of Mississippi. In <em>Muir-head </em>we noted that \u201c[i]n Mississippi, as in several other states, where a debt is barred, the mortgage cannot be enforced\u201d and that \u201c[t]he lien is incident to the debt and does not stand separately.\u201d 42 F.3d at 966 (internal quotations omitted). Louisiana Civil Code article 3498 provides a prescriptive period for promissory notes of five years \u201cfrom the day payment is exigible.\u201d Louisiana Civil Code article 3282 provides that a \u201c[m]ortgage is accessory to the obligation that it secures. Consequently, except as provided by law, the mortgagee may enforce the mortgage only to the extent that he may enforce any obligation it secures.\u201d Thus, Louisiana, like Mississippi, \u201cforecloses an action or proceedings to enforce a lien not brought within the time for commencing a suit on the debt involved.\u201d <em>Muirhead, </em>42 F.3d at 966. Oliver has failed to identify any difference between Louisiana and Mississippi law in this respect. Accordingly, Oliver\u2019s attempt to distinguish <em>Muirhead </em>fails.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b225-5\">In addition, article 3282 is not absolute. A mortgagee may enforce a mortgage if \u201cprovided by law\u201d even if the obligation secured by the mortgage is not enforceable. La. Civ.Code art. 3282. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2415 distinguishes between actions for recovery on the promissory note and actions to foreclose on the security, <em>Davidson, </em>44 F.3d at 249, and thus provides a basis for invoking the exception provided for in article 3282. Additionally, Oliver expressly waived the application of state law in signing the mortgages.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-8\">Oliver raises other issues, but all are a variation of the same theme: that Louisiana law somehow renders this mortgage unenforceable. All fail in the face of <em>Muirhead, </em>by which we are bound.</p>\n<p id=\"b225-9\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b223-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b224-11\">. Section 3716 concerns administrative offsets. 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3716(e)(1).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b225-6\">. On this point, to the extent that a recent Louisiana Court of Appeals decision can be read as reaching a contrary conclusion, we respectfully disagree. <em>LLP Mortg., Ltd. v. Food Innovisions, Inc., </em>997 So.2d 628, 629 (La.Ct.App.2008)(not yet released for publication)(addressing a claim by a private successor to a federal agency). Because the case before us involves a suit by a federal agency regarding interpretation of federal law, we are bound to follow <em>Muirhead, </em>rather than a state court decision. We note, too, that the mortgage at issue in the <em>Food Innovisions </em>case does not appear to have included the waiver language quoted above.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
