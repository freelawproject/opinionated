He argues that the BIA erred in holding that his father\u2019s knowledge of Mushtaq\u2019s inadmissibility at the time that Mushtaq entered the United States as a minor is imputed to Mushtaq, thereby disqualifying him from relief under \u00a7 1182(k). He also argues that the IJ erred in denying relief under \u00a7 1182(k) as a matter of discretion. In <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"884\">*884</page-number>dismissing Mushtaq\u2019s appeal, the BIA found only that the imputation of Mushtaq\u2019s father\u2019s knowledge to Mushtaq was proper for purposes of \u00a7 1182(k), and it did not address the IJ\u2019s alternative, discretion-based denial.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-4\">Because this court generally reviews only the BIA\u2019s decision, the issue whether the IJ erred in denying relief as a matter of discretion is not properly before us. <em>See Mikhael v. INS, </em>115 F.3d 299, 302 (5th Cir.1997). However, even if Mushtaq were to show that the BIA erred in imputing his father\u2019s knowledge to him, remand to the BIA for a determination of the propriety of the IJ\u2019s discretion-based denial would be necessary before this case could be decided. <em>See Nakimbugwe v. Gonzales, </em>475 F.3d 281, 284-85 (5th Cir. 2007). Further, the Government is correct that if the BIA were to affirm the IJ\u2019s discretion-based denial, this court would lack jurisdiction to review that denial pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii). <em>See Ayanbadejo v. Chertoff, </em>517 F.3d 273, 276-77 (5th Cir.2008) (holding that this court lacks jurisdiction to review denials when the applicable statute specifies, as does \u00a7 1182(k), that relief is discretionary). Accordingly, before this court reaches the complex question whether Mushtaq\u2019s father\u2019s knowledge was properly imputed to Mushtaq, judicial economy dictates that we REMAND this case to the BIA for the limited purpose of determining whether the IJ erred in denying relief under \u00a7 1182(k) as a matter of discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b906-5\">REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b905-16\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
