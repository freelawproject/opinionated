We affirm the judgment of the district court, and we award Canada Life attorney fees incurred on this appeal. We remand for the limited purpose of determining a reasonable amount for fees and costs covering this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"A67\">We may affirm the district court on any ground supported by the record. <em>Atel Fin. Corp. v. Quaker Coal Co., </em>321 F.3d 924, 926 (9th Cir.2003) (per curiam). Because we conclude Canada Life was entitied to summary judgment on the ground of LaPeter\u2019s material misrepresentations, we need not address the parties\u2019 other claims.</p>\n<p id=\"A_V\">Canada Life was entitled to cancel the parties\u2019 Loan Commitment Letter (\u201cLCL\u201d) because LaPeter made material misrepresentations concerning the Talbots lease, which entitled Canada Life to terminate the LCL. <em>See Robinson v. State Farm Mutual Auto. Ins. Co., </em>137 Idaho 173, 45 P.3d 829, 836 (2002). (\u201c[I]f a party\u2019s manifestation of assent to contract was induced by either a fraudulent or a material misrepresentation by the other party, upon which the recipient was justified in relying, the contract was voidable by the recipi-. ent.\u201d). Canada Life has provided clear and convincing evidence of LaPeter\u2019s misrepresentations. <em>See Faw v. Greenwood, </em>101 Idaho 387, 613 P.2d 1338, 1340 (1980). At the onset of refinancing negotiations LaPeter told Canada Life that Talbots would not renew its lease and that the Mall would thus generate less rental income. LaPeter later learned that Talbots decided to extend its lease, yet subsequently he told or represented to Canada Life on several occasions that Talbots was leaving the Mall. Moreover, even if we had determined to the contrary that La-Peter made no misleading statements, he still breached his affirmative duty under Idaho law to inform Canada Life of the Talbots lease extension because disclosure was necessary \u201cto prevent a partial statement of the facts from being misleading.\u201d <em>Sowards v. Rathbun, </em>134 Idaho 702, 8 P.3d 1245, 1250 (2000). LaPeter\u2019s misrepresentations were material because the Talbots renewal gave LaPeter substantially more rental income than he had represented to Canada Life; in fact, it had a larger impact on future rent than did the KeyBank lease modifications,</p>\n<p id=\"Ap1s\">LaPeter\u2019s other claims fail in light of his material misrepresentations regarding the Talbots lease. We affirm the district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment on La-Peter\u2019s claim that Canada Life breached the covenant of good faith because Canada Life was entitled to terminate the LCL once it discovered LaPeter\u2019s material misrepresentations. Similarly, we reject La-Peter\u2019s contention that whether the loan\u2019s five percent interest rate was below the market rate represents a genuine issue of material fact. The interest rate issue is not material because LaPeter\u2019s misrepresentations justified Canada Life\u2019s termination of the LCL regardless of whether the LCL\u2019s interest rate was below market.</p>\n<p id=\"b425-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"403\">*403</page-number>We hold that Canada Life is entitled to appellate attorney fees. This lawsuit concerns a commercial transaction for purposes of Idaho Code \u00a7 12-120(3). <em>Cf. Interform Co. v. Mitchell, </em>575 F.2d 1270, 1280 (9th Cir.1978) (\u201cWe must, of course, follow Idaho law as to attorney\u2019s fees in this diversity action.\u201d). Canada Life is the prevailing party because it has defeated LaPeter\u2019s claims through summary judgment. Under Idaho law it is entitled to reasonable attorney fees incurred on appeal. <em>See Blimka v. My Web Wholesaler, LLC, </em>143 Idaho 723, 152 P.3d 594, 599-600 (2007). We remand to the district court for calculation of fees. <em>Maljack Productions, Inc. v. GoodTimes Home Video Corp., </em>81 F.3d 881, 891 (9th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b425-5\">AFFIRMED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"A0K\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by Ninth Circuit Rule 36-3.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
