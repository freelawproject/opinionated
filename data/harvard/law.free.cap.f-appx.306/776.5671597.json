We will affirm his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-5\">Darby challenges the District Court\u2019s denial of his motion to suppress without holding an evidentiary hearing. The motion did not include any factual basis for suppression. Before trial, the District Court inquired as to whether such a basis existed, to which Darby responded, \u201cYour Honor, I\u2019ll submit to the Court\u2019s discretion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b799-6\">\u201cA defendant seeking an evidentiary hearing on a motion to suppress must provide sufficient information to enable the court to conclude that a substantial claim is presented and that there are disputed issues of material fact which will affect the outcome of the motion.\u201d <em>United States v. Juarez, </em>454 F.3d 717, 719-20 (7th Cir.2006) (citing <em>United States v. Coleman, </em>149 F.3d 674, 677 (7th Cir.1998)) (internal quotation mark omitted); <em>see also United States v. Voigt, </em>89 F.3d 1050, 1067 (3d Cir.1996) (a defendant is entitled to a pretrial hearing when his \u201cmoving papers ... demonstrate a colorable claim for relief ... [and] must consist of more than mere bald-faced allegations of misconduct\u201d (internal citations and quotation marks omitted)). Because Darby\u2019s counsel did not present a factual basis for suppression, the District Court did not err in failing to conduct an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-7\">Darby also complains about an allegedly prejudicial statement in the testimony of a government witness and a curative instruction the District Court gave the jury in response. During the direct examination of Sergeant Burgos of the Newark Police Department, he was asked \u201cwhat type of operation\u201d he was involved in at the time of the arrest, to which he responded, \u201c[n]arcotics investigation and gang investigation.\u201d Darby\u2019s counsel objected and requested a mistrial, which the Court denied. After conferring with counsel, the Court issued a curative instruction to the jury,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-9\">\u201cLadies and gentlemen, you just heard the sergeant mention the type of duty he was on that day involving narcotics and gangs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-10\">This case has nothing to do with gangs, so that\u2019s not to be dealt with in any way. This case has to do with what the prosecutor told you in his opening statement.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b799-11\">So I just want you to be aware of that. Okay?\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b799-12\">Darby did not object to the curative instruction. He now argues that the instruction exacerbated Sergeant Burgos\u2019s allegedly prejudicial testimony, \u201clending credibility to the prosecution\u2019s version of the events,\u201d and amounting to reversible error.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-13\">Any prejudice that may have resulted from Sergeant Burgos\u2019s testimony was eliminated by the District Court\u2019s curative instruction. \u201c[W]e ... presume that a jury will follow an instruction to disregard ... evidence inadvertently presented to it, unless there is an overwhelming probability that the jury will be unable to follow the court\u2019s instructions, and a strong likelihood that the effect of the evidence would be devastating to the defendant.\u201d <em>United States v. Thornton, </em>1 F.3d 149, 157 (3d Cir.1993) (quoting <em>Greer v. Miller, </em>483 U.S. 756, 766 n. 8, 107 S.Ct. 3102, 97 L.Ed.2d 618 (1987)) (internal quotation mark omitted). Darby has not demonstrated that this standard is met.</p>\n<p id=\"b799-14\">Darby contends that the curative instruction exacerbated the prejudice he allegedly suffered as a result of Sergeant\u2019s Burgos\u2019s testimony about gangs. We conclude that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in composing the curative instruction. Darby\u2019s trial counsel \u201cdid not object to the phrasing of the instruction, a fact which suggests that counsel agreed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"778\">*778</page-number>with the Judge\u2019s approach.\u201d <em>United States v. Hakim, </em>344 F.3d 324, 331 (3d Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b800-4\">Finally, Darby asserts that the District Court erred in admitting into evidence a' photograph taken of him on the day of his arrest because \u201cit further exacerbate[d] his possible gang affiliation\u201d and was unnecessary cumulative evidence. He also argues that the District Court erred in. permitting testimony about a narcotics field test of a plastic bag seized from him. He asserts that this testimony was \u201cneedless ... cumulative evidence.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b800-5\">\u201cWe review a district court\u2019s decision to admit or exclude evidence for abuse of discretion, and such discretion is construed especially broadly in the context of Rule 403.\u201d <em>United States v. Kemp, </em>500 F.3d 257, 295 (3d Cir.2007) (quoting <em>United States v. Mathis, </em>264 F.3d 321, 326-27 (3d Cir.2001)). Applying this deferential standard of review, we find that the District Court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that the probative value of the photograph was neither substantially outweighed by the spectre of unfair prejudice nor needless presentation of cumulative evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-6\">Because Darby\u2019s counsel did not object to the testimony regarding the narcotics field test, we apply the plain error standard. <em>United States v. Moore, </em>375 F.3d 259, 262 (3d Cir.2004). Other than making a conclusory assertion that this evidence was \u201cunduly prejudicial and a \u2018needless presentation of cumulative evidence,\u2019 \u201d Darby does not provide this Court with a' reason why we should find plain error.</p>\n<p id=\"b800-7\">In sum, we conclude that Darby\u2019s appeal lacks merit. Accordingly, we will affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
