Because the district court did not err in calculating his advisory sentencing-guidelines range, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-18\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-19\">On February 16, 2006, members of a DEA task force arrested Easley after watching him take part in an attempted drug sale. They found crack cocaine and other drugs on him and discovered more drugs, scales, a cooking tube, two handguns and a large quantity of cash in his home. In July 2006, a federal grand jury indicted Easley for possessing with intent to distribute at least 50 grams of crack cocaine and unspecified amounts of hydrocodone and marijuana. See 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1).</p>\n<p id=\"b1016-20\">The drugs seized during the February 2006 arrest, as it turns out, scratched the surface of Easley\u2019s drug trade. As Easley admitted to investigators in October 2006, he had been selling drugs for more than two decades. While he had sold a variety of drugs to his customers over the years, crack long had been his best seller. During one fifteen-year stretch, he sold four ounces (roughly 113 grams) of crack every week. Even the February arrest and July indictment did not curb his business: By <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"995\">*995</page-number>the time he met with the investigators, eight months after his arrest, he had been caught three more times selling crack and other drugs, each time resulting in a separate state-court indictment.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-5\">In August 2007, Easley pleaded guilty to the federal charges stemming from the February 2006 arrest. In calculating his advisory sentencing-guidelines range, the presentence report (PSR) considered the drugs seized in connection with the February arrest and his earlier drug sales dating back to 1988. Taking Easley at his word, the PSR added up Easley\u2019s estimates of prior weekly sales, attributing to him total sales of over 83 kilograms of crack along with sales of other drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-6\">Over Easley\u2019s objection, the district court accepted the PSR\u2019s drug-quantity finding. After addressing the statutory sentencing factors, <em>see </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a), the court imposed a bottom-of-the-guidelines sentence of 360 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-8\">In appealing his sentence, Easley argues that the district court miscalculated the guidelines range, which (if true) generally would establish that the sentence was procedurally unreasonable. <em>See Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 586, 596-97, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). As Easley sees it, the court\u2019s drug-quantity equation should not have included his earlier drug sales for two reasons: (1) They do not constitute \u201crelevant conduct\u201d under the guidelines, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3, and (2) the only evidence of the sales \u2014 Easley\u2019s account during the October 2006 interview \u2014 is unreliable, principally because it failed to account for his time in prison. We give fresh review to the district court\u2019s interpretation of the meaning of \u201crelevant conduct\u201d and review its factual findings for clear error. <em>See United States v. Maken, </em>510 F.3d 654, 656-57 (6th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-10\">A.</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-11\">One component of the sentencing calculus in a drug-trafficking case is the quantity of drugs involved, which requires the district judge to distinguish between drug-related activities that constitute \u201crelevant conduct\u201d (which affect the offense level) and unrelated misdeeds (which do not). <em>See United States v. Gill, </em>348 F.3d 147, 149, 151-52 (6th Cir.2003). As the guidelines explain, \u201cquantities and types of drugs not specified in the count of conviction\u201d must be included in the drug-quantity equation \u201cif they were part of the same course of conduct or part of a common scheme or plan as the count of conviction.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3 background note; <em>see United States v. Smith, </em>245 F.3d 538, 544 (6th Cir.2001). Prior drug transactions satisfy that standard if they are \u201csubstantially connected\u201d to the offense of conviction \u201cby at least one common factor, such as ... common accomplices, common purpose, or similar modus operandi,\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3 n. 9(A), or if they \u201care part of a single episode, spree, or ongoing series of offenses,\u201d taking into account the \u201cdegree of similarity of the offenses, the regularity (repetitions) of the offenses, and the time interval between the offenses,\u201d <em>id. </em>\u00a7 1B1.3 n. 9(B); <em>see also United States v. Hill, </em>79 F.3d 1477, 1481-82 (6th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b1017-12\">The district court legitimately concluded that Easley\u2019s prior drug transactions involved the same course of conduct as his crime of conviction. Easley pleaded guilty to possessing with intent to distribute crack and hydrocodone \u2014 the same two drugs he told investigators he had been peddling steadily since the mid-1980s. The drug paraphernalia found at his home \u2014 equipment, guns and cash \u2014 confirmed that his business was ongoing and thriving, and so did his three state-law arrests after the federal indictment. Even though the PSR provides few details about <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"996\">*996</page-number>the prior drug deals, Easley\u2019s own description of them establishes them similarity and regularity.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-4\">Easley\u2019s rejoinder is that the length of time between the first drag sales, which date back to 1988, and his offense stretches \u201crelevant conduct\u201d to the breaking point. Even shorter gaps between the offense of conviction and similar prior misdeeds, we have held, can break the common-plan or course-of-conduct link. <em>See, e.g., United States v. Kappes, </em>936 F.2d 227, 230-31 (1991) (holding that two instances of disability-benefits fraud six years apart were not part of the same course of conduct or common plan such that the first fraud could not constitute relevant conduct in sentencing the defendant for the second). But as <em>Kappes </em>and common sense tell us, two isolated offenses separated by a several-year delay differ from a long-running drug-distribution business operated by the same defendant for over a decade. <em>See id. </em>at 230. Doubtless, a time lapse between a defendant\u2019s first drug deal and the one that leads to his conviction may make it harder for the government to prove the facts of the earlier acts. But to the extent those acts are part of one steady, continuous pattern, a longer time span makes it more, not less, likely that the acts involve the same course of conduct. The district court did not err in considering Easley\u2019s earlier drug transactions in its drug-quantity calculation.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-5\">B.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-6\">But even if these earlier drug transactions may be considered relevant conduct as a matter of law, Easley argues that the district court clearly erred as a matter of fact in making the drug-quantity calculations. Easley takes issue not with the district court\u2019s arithmetic but with the reliability of the evidence purporting to support its figures because (1) his statement to investigators \u2014 describing the amount of crack he sold per week between 1988 and 2005 \u2014 does not supply adequate evidence to support the court\u2019s drug-quantity calculation, and (2) the district court\u2019s addition of prior drug sales based on this estimate did not account for the fact that Easley had been arrested several times in that period and had spent roughly six years between 1988 and 2005 behind bars.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-8\">That the district court accepted the PSR\u2019s account of Easley\u2019s prior acts, which in turn summarized what Easley told investigators, without hearing other evidence does not undermine its decision. In determining drug quantities, as in determining other sentencing facts, a \u201cdistrict court may rely on any competent evidence in the record\u201d so long as it \u201cha[s] some minimum indicium of reliability beyond mere allegation.\u201d <em>United States v. Hough, </em>276 F.3d 884, 891 (6th Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks omitted); <em>see also </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3661; U.S.S.G. \u00a7 6A1.3(a). An unrebutted statement by the <em>defendant </em>generally will satisfy this requirement. <em>See Gill, </em>348 F.3d at 156.</p>\n<p id=\"b1018-9\">Nor does it make a difference that Easley described his previous practices in an interview with the police, as opposed to testifying at the sentencing hearing or submitting a notarized written statement. A party admission is not hearsay, and at any rate the rules of evidence generally do not apply to sentencing hearings. <em>See </em>Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2)(A), 1101(d)(3); <em>United States v. Hamad, </em>495 F.3d 241, 246 (6th Cir.2007). A district court thus may consider hearsay statements contained in a PSR if they bear indicia of reliability and the court gives the defendant an opportunity to rebut them. <em>See United States v. Silverman, </em>976 F.2d 1502, 1511-13 (6th Cir.1992) (en banc); <em>see also United States v. Katzopoulos, </em>437 F.3d 569, 574-76 (6th Cir.2006). The district court gave Easley a chance to rebut or alter his statement, but aside from contesting the reliability of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"997\">*997</page-number>his own recollection in general terms, he neither presented any evidence of his own nor identified a specific, material inaccuracy in the PSR\u2019s summary of what he said. <em>See United States v. Swanberg, </em>370 F.3d 622, 625 (6th Cir.2004). He thus has no reason to complain about the district court\u2019s decision to accept his unrebutted account.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-5\">The district court\u2019s failure to account for Easley\u2019s six years of prison time during these 17 years of drug trafficking is a trickier matter. Whether Easley temporarily suspended his drug dealing while incarcerated, as he implies, or whether he continued to sell drugs through outside associates or \u201cresumed selling with a vengeance\u201d (to make up for lost sales) after his release, as the government speculates, Br. at 20, it is odd that the PSR and the district court never mentioned the point. Of course, Easley and his counsel share some of the blame because they did not mention it either in their written objections to the PSR or at the sentencing hearing; they argued more generally about the unreliability of Easley\u2019s memory. But we need not decide whether plain error applies because any apparent error could not have made a difference in Easley\u2019s sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-6\">A sentencing mistake is harmless when the record establishes that the district court would have imposed the same sentence with or without the error. <em>See United States v. Alford, </em>436 F.3d 677, 682-83 (6th Cir.2006); <em>see also United States v. Anderson, </em>526 F.3d 319, 330 (6th Cir.2008). Drug-quantity miscalculations that do not affect the defendant\u2019s guidelines range often fall into that category. <em>See United States v. Charles, </em>138 F.3d 257, 268 (6th Cir.1998); <em>United States v. Hettinger, </em>242 F. App\u2019x 287, 296 (6th Cir.2007). The guidelines after all contemplate something less than mathematical precision in this area, allowing a district court to \u201cestimate\u201d the quantities involved when police do not recover the drugs at issue. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1 n. 12; <em>see also Anderson, </em>526 F.3d at 326.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-8\">In this case, as the district court appreciated, the amount of drugs so far exceeded the threshold for the highest tier of the drug-quantity table that even excluding a great deal of them would not have affected Easley\u2019s offense level. Setting aside the other drugs Easley was pushing, his offense level would have reached the highest rung of the drug-quantity ladder even if the court had attributed 4.5 kilograms (as opposed to 83 kilograms) of crack to him \u2014 under the guidelines then in effect. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c)(l) (2007); <em>cf </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1(c)(1) (2005) (requiring only 1.5 kilograms of crack to reach the highest offense level). Moving that much merchandise would be no small feat for most sellers. But at the rate Easley acknowledged he was selling crack for well over a decade, he would have reached that amount in just over nine months. At Easley\u2019s pace, even if one excludes the time he was incarcerated, the amount of crack he sold would surpass the threshold for the highest guidelines range nearly thirteen times over. And even if the court had counted only the time since 1997 when Easley ended his last lengthy stay in prison (on the theory that activities before that imprisonment are too remote to be relevant conduct), he still would have sold over nine times the minimum needed to make it to the top tier of the drug-quantity table. Correcting the district court\u2019s mistake \u2014 if a mistake it was \u2014 would not have affected his advisory offense level.</p>\n<p id=\"b1019-9\">Nor is there any other reason to think that this correction would have affected his sentence. To the contrary: the court noted that, had the range not been so high already, it \u201cwould probably [have] adjusted] the range up,\u201d but it was \u201cnot <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"998\">*998</page-number>necessary to do that in this case because of the very high range.\u201d JA 60. The court\u2019s failure to account for Easley\u2019s imprisonment could not plausibly have affected his sentence, making any potential error harmless.</p>\n<p id=\"Aak\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"ABeG\">For these reasons, we affirm,</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
