Kellogg (\u201cKellogg\u201d) appeals from a district court order convicting him of being a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1), possession with intent to distribute cocaine hydrochloride in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1) and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). Specifically, Kellogg contends that the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress his statements to investigators; abused its discretion in admitting evidence of a previous armed robbery; and abused its discretion in admitting an in-court witness identification. For the following reasons, we REVERSE in part and AFFIRM in part the judgment of the district court, and REMAND the case to the district court for a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b939-18\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"A5M\">I. Factual Background</p>\n<p id=\"b939-19\">On October 12, 2005, a team of United States Marshals and two detectives with <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"918\">*918</page-number>the Marion County Sheriffs Department sought to execute a federal arrest warrant for Kellogg at a duplex located at 111 Old Jasper Highway in South Pittsburgh, Tennessee (the \u201cduplex\u201d). Kellogg was wanted for violating the terms of his supervised release on a prior bank robbery conviction, and was also suspected of a recent armed bank robbery in Guntersville, Alabama. Kellogg had been staying with Tiffany Huckabee (\u201cHuckabee\u201d), a \u201cfriend of an associate,\u201d for three or four nights. (Joint Appendix (\u201cJ.A.\u201d) at 367.) Three other adults and Huckabee\u2019s two children were also staying in the duplex while Kellogg was there.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-4\">From the parking lot outside the duplex, one of the detectives called Huckabee on the telephone and informed her that they had a warrant for Kellogg\u2019s arrest. Huckabee responded that Kellogg told her that \u201che had nothing[.]\u201d (J.A. at 345.) The detective instructed Huckabee and the other residents to come out of the duplex first, and for Kellogg to follow them out. The marshals secured Kellogg, placed him in handcuffs and took him into custody when he came out as instructed. The marshals searched him and found approximately $1,000 on his person.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-5\">The marshals contacted Federal Bureau of Investigation (\u201cFBI\u201d) Special Agents James Melia (\u201cMelia\u201d) and Stanley Ruffin (\u201cRuffin\u201d), who were helping FBI agents in Alabama investigate Kellogg\u2019s involvement in the Guntersville robbery. When Melia and Ruffin arrived at the scene of the arrest at approximately 7:00 p.m., the marshals informed Melia that they had conducted a security sweep of the duplex and had discovered drugs in one of its bedrooms. Melia spoke with Huckabee and obtained her consent to search the duplex. Melia then approached Kellogg, told Kellogg that he wanted permission to search the residence and presented him with a consent form to search. In response, Kellogg told him that his consent was not necessary, that anything illegal in the apartment was his, and that he did not want Huckabee to be blamed for whatever might be found. Kellogg nevertheless signed the consent form. Prior to conducting the search, the agents asked Kellogg if he had a gun on the premises, and if he had any drugs or drug paraphernalia. Kellogg told the agents where powder cocaine, marijuana, cash and a gun could be found in the residence. Melia also asked Kellogg if the cash drawer from the Guntersville bank robbery was in the duplex. Kellogg responded that the drawer was not in the residence because he \u201cgot rid of it in Alabama.\u201d (J.A. at 81) The agents recovered from the residence a number of items related to the Alabama bank robbery, including a wristwatch, a New York Yankees baseball cap, and tennis shoes that matched the general description of the robber\u2019s clothes and a shoe print taken from the counter of the robbed bank. Agents also recovered two packages of powder cocaine, digital scales and other drug paraphernalia, a nine-millimeter pistol and sixty dollars in cash.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-7\">Following the search, Melia and Ruffin transported Kellogg to the FBI office in Chattanooga, Tennessee, for further questioning. Kellogg signed a form waiving his <em>Miranda </em>rights at approximately 7:20 p.m., though it is unclear whether this occurred before or after he left with Melia and Ruffin.</p>\n<p id=\"b940-8\">At the FBI office, Melia and Ruffin questioned Kellogg about the Guntersville robbery. During the questioning, Kellogg stated that he knew he was in \u201cmajor trouble\u201d because he was caught with a gun and drugs. Regarding the bank robbery, Kellogg told them that \u201cyou can close it on me.\u201d Melia asked Kellogg if the firearm found at the duplex was the same one used during the Guntersville robbery. Accord<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"919\">*919</page-number>ing to Melia, Kellogg \u201ctold me that if we had ballistic testing on it that the gun would match the gun that was fired in the bank robbery.\u201d (J.A. at 83-84.) Melia and Ruffin also asked Kellogg about the $1,000 they found when searching him. Kellogg stated that \u201cit was proceeds from something else\u201d and that he did not want to discuss it. (J.A. at 86.)</p>\n<p id=\"b941-5\">On December 13, 2005, a grand jury sitting in the Eastern District of Tennessee issued a three-count indictment against Kellogg. Count one alleged that Kellogg was a felon in possession of a firearm, count two alleged that Kellogg possessed cocaine with intent to distribute, and count three alleged that Kellogg possessed a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-6\">II. Suppression Hearing</p>\n<p id=\"b941-7\">Prior to trial, Kellogg moved to suppress the statements he made outside the duplex and at the FBI office. A suppression hearing was held before a magistrate judge and Kellogg, Melia and Ruffin testified.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-8\">Kellogg testified that at the time of the arrest he was \u201con three [of] what you would call Xanaxes, footballs, the street name is ... blue footballs.\u201d (J.A. at 108.) Kellogg testified that he could not have consented to the search of his residence or waived his rights because \u201cI wasn\u2019t in my right frame of mind to waive my rights.\u201d (J.A. at 109.) Kellogg also contended that he did not make any statements regarding the ownership or location of drugs, weapons or any of the other items seized during the search of his residence; he had only overheard the marshals discussing items that were recovered during the protective sweep and relayed that information to Melia. Moreover, Kellogg testified that he felt coerced into signing the consent to search form because he wanted Huckabee and her children to be able to return to their home. According to Kellogg, Melia read him the <em>Miranda </em>rights waiver form and handed it to him to sign during the car ride to the FBI office.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-10\">Melia testified that he brought consent to search and <em>Miranda </em>rights waiver forms to Kellogg \u201cjust about immediately\u201d after arriving at the duplex, and at that time read Kellogg his <em>Miranda </em>rights. (J.A. at 92) Melia stated that although Kellogg signed the consent to search form, he may not have signed the <em>Miranda </em>waiver until \u201clater ... possibly in the car[.]\u201d (JA. at 92-93.) On redirect, Melia stated that he would never question a suspect in custody before he waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights, and added that he believed, \u201cafter reviewing these things,\u201d that he had Kellogg sign both forms before asking him any questions. (J.A. at 164.) Melia testified that Kellogg did not request an attorney or invoke his right to remain silent at any time during the interview at the FBI office.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-11\">Ruffin testified that he and Melia questioned Kellogg about the location of drugs and weapons in the duplex \u201cbecause of safety!.]\u201d (JA. at 146.) He stated that he and Melia executed the <em>Miranda </em>rights waiver form after Kellogg signed the consent to search form and the search was conducted, though he could not recall whether Kellogg signed the waiver before they departed for the FBI office.</p>\n<p id=\"b941-12\">Following the hearing, the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation denying Kellogg\u2019s motion to suppress. <em>United States v. Kellogg, </em>No. 05 Cr. 148, 2006 WL 3196902 (E.D.Tenn. Nov. 1, 2006). The magistrate judge did not find Kellogg credible, rejecting his testimony that he was intoxicated when he signed the consent to search and <em>Miranda </em>waiver forms. <em>Id. </em>at *6. The magistrate judge found that Kellogg had not received a <em>Miranda </em>warning prior to the agents asking <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"920\">*920</page-number>for consent to search, but that Kellogg\u2019s rights were not violated at that time because the request to search was \u201cnot an interrogation.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *8. The magistrate judge found that whether Kellogg was informed of and waived his rights prior to divulging the location of contraband and other items in the duplex was unclear from the record, but that those statements were nevertheless admissible under the public safety exception established in <em>New York v. Quarles, </em>467 U.S. 649, 656, 104 S.Ct. 2626, 81 L.Ed.2d 550 (1984). <em>Id. </em>The magistrate judge found that Kellogg signed the <em>Miranda </em>waiver form prior to the questioning at the FBI office in Chattanooga. <em>Id. </em>at *11. The magistrate judge\u2019s denial of the motion to suppress was subsequently adopted by the district court and Kellogg proceeded to trial on all three counts against him. <em>Id. </em>at *1.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-4\">III. Trial</p>\n<p id=\"b942-5\">Prior to Melia testifying at trial, the district court granted Kellogg\u2019s motion to exclude mention of Kellogg\u2019s alleged role in the Guntersville bank robbery, and to limit Melia to references that he was investigating Kellogg\u2019s role in \u201canother crime.\u201d (J.A. at 199-200.) During his testimony, Melia recounted his interaction with Kellogg outside the duplex and Kellogg\u2019s statements regarding the location of the gun, drugs, drug paraphernalia and cash in the duplex. Melia also testified that at the FBI office in Chattanooga, Kellogg had \u201csaid that if I did forensic testing on the gun it would match the shot that was fired during the other crime I was investigating.\u201d (J.A. at 231-82.) Kellogg moved for a mistrial, arguing that Melia\u2019s testimony was unfairly prejudicial; the court denied the motion. After other witnesses testified about the gun having been manufactured in Arkansas and about the drugs found at the residence, the government rested.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-6\">Kellogg testified in his own defense. He denied telling Melia outside the duplex about the location of contraband, stating that \u201cI told [the agents] what I heard as far as the officers when they found [the items], but I did not tell him those things were mine, or that I had first-hand knowledge of those things, items.\u201d (J.A. at 379.) A little later, he stated that Melia \u201cnever questioned me about whether the gun was mine or not, all he wanted to do was wrap this up, and let\u2019s get gone.\u201d (J.A. at 379-80.) He explained the discrepancy between his account and Melia\u2019s by stating, \u201cI\u2019m not going to call Mr. Melia a liar, I respect his position, but what they are doing, they are stretching the truth.\u201d (J.A. at 379.) Kellogg testified that he knew better than to possess the illegal items that Melia was attributing to him:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"ADTL\">[L]adies and gentlemen, during those eight-and-a-half years that I done in prison, possession of a firearm, possession of cocaine, -possession of any drug paraphernalia, or any weapon paraphernalia, even a bullet, possession of those items could amount to a term substantially because I\u2019m a two time offender, this would be a third strike, so I did not want to put myself in a situation to go to prison for the rest of my life.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b942-7\">(J.A. at 381.) At the close of his direct testimony, Kellogg categorically denied all of the charges against him. Following a cross-examination wherein Kellogg continued to dispute Melia\u2019s account of events and deny ownership of the items found in the duplex, the defense rested.</p>\n<p id=\"b942-8\">After the jury was excused, the government proffered evidence regarding the Guntersville bank robbery, including the testimony of the FBI agent investigating the robbery, photographs of Kellogg at the robbery wearing clothing items found at the duplex, and the shoe print on the bank counter matching shoes found at the du<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"921\">*921</page-number>plex. Kellogg objected to the government\u2019s evidence, arguing that the government\u2019s photographic evidence could not be authenticated and that the evidence was unfairly prejudicial. In response, the government stated that it would call the bank teller working during the robbery to authenticate the photographs. The district court ruled that the proffered testimony and evidence was admissible. The court noted that Kellogg had created a credibility issue in claiming that he did not possess the firearm or make statements to that effect, and that the photographs were also relevant to the interstate nexus of the firearm. The court concluded that the evidence would not be unfairly prejudicial, and that Kellogg \u201cby his own testimony has made the bank robbery evidence more critical to the government\u2019s case.\u201d (J.A. at 426-27.) The district judge stated he would give a limiting instruction to the jury that the bank robbery evidence should not be considered as evidence that the defendant is guilty of the crimes charged in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-5\">Prior to the bank teller\u2019s testimony, Kellogg\u2019s counsel conducted a voir dire examination of her outside of the jury\u2019s presence. During voir dire, the bank teller testified that she did not see the man who robbed her in the courtroom, even though Kellogg was sitting in the courtroom at the time.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-6\">On direct examination, the bank teller testified that on October 4, 2005, while working at the Colonial Bank in Guntersville, she was held up at gunpoint by a \u201ctall black man\u201d of \u201cmedium complexion\u201d wearing a striped shirt and New York Yankees baseball cap. (J.A. at 439, 452, 456.) She stated that the robber handed her a note, and she \u201clooked up at his face[.]\u201d (J.A. at 445.) She testified that when she told him she did not have the money in the front area where the tellers were, the robber threatened her and asked her if \u201cshe want[ed] to die.\u201d (J.A. at 454.) She testified that the robber\u2019s gun was \u201cbig and kind of squared off and dark in color.\u201d (J.A. at 447.) She stated that the robber stepped onto the bank counter and \u201cfired the gun into the ceiling\u201d because he got frustrated with the amount of time it was taking her to give him money from the cash drawer, at which point she gave him the entire cash drawer. (J.A. at 446-47.) The government presented the teller with a number of photographs from the bank robbery, and she testified that the photographs accurately depicted the bank and the events she described in her testimony. When the prosecutor asked if one of the men in the photographs was the robber, she stated: \u201cIt is. And I do recognize the man. I\u2019m sorry. He just, he had a hat on, but I do recognize the man. He\u2019s sitting at the table over there.\u201d (J.A. at 450.) On cross-examination, defense counsel challenged her regarding her prior inability to identify Kellogg as the bank robber; the teller responded that during voir dire she \u201cwasn\u2019t really looking that closely.\u201d (J.A. at 459-60.)</p>\n<p id=\"b943-8\">Another government witness, the FBI agent who had investigated the bank robbery, then testified that the bank robber wore shoes that had \u201czig zag lines in the shoe print along with a circular honeycomb print,\u201d and that shoes found at the duplex were \u201cconsistent with what I saw of the print.\u201d (J.A. at 466-67.) He also testified that three days after the bank robbery, FBI agents found ammunition matching the gun fired in the robbery in a car in Guntersville that was registered in Kellogg\u2019s name.</p>\n<p id=\"b943-9\">The government recalled Melia, who testified that when he questioned Kellogg about the bank robbery at the FBI office, Kellogg said that he \u201cdid it\u201d and used the robbery money to buy a car, among other things. (J.A. at 478.) Melia also testified <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"922\">*922</page-number>that Kellogg admitted to wearing the New York Yankees baseball hat and the wristwatch that were found in the duplex while committing the robbery. Finally, he restated his prior testimony that Kellogg admitted the gun found at the duplex was the gun he used during the robbery.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-4\">At the close of evidence, Kellogg moved for an acquittal, and the court denied the motion. Kellogg timely appeals his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-5\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"ANW\">I. Motion to Suppress</p>\n<p id=\"b944-6\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b944-7\">In reviewing a district court\u2019s suppression determination, we review findings of fact for clear error, and legal conclusions <em>de novo. United States v. Hudson, </em>405 F.3d 425, 431 (6th Cir.2005). Where a district court denies a motion to suppress, \u201cwe consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the government.\u201d <em>United States v. Carter, </em>378 F.3d 584, 587 (6th Cir.2004) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-8\">B. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b944-9\">\u201cThe Fifth Amendment guarantees that \u2018no person ... shall be compelled in a criminal case to be a witness against himself.\u2019 \u201d <em>New York v. Quarles, </em>467 U.S. 649, 654, 104 S.Ct. 2626, 81 L.Ed.2d 550 (1984). In <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966), the Supreme Court extended the protection against compulsory self-incrimination to individuals in police custody. <em>Quarles, </em>467 U.S. at 654, 104 S.Ct. 2626. \u201cAs a general rule, when a defendant is in custody, law officials must give him appropriate <em>Miranda </em>warnings before interrogation begins; otherwise, any statements resulting from the police interrogation will be inadmissible unless the defendant clearly and-intelligently waived his rights.\u201d <em>United States v. Clark, </em>982 F.2d 965, 967-68 (6th Cir.1993). Custody and interrogation are therefore the two \u201cprerequisites to the triggering of Fifth Amendment privileges.\u201d <em>United States v. Latouf, </em>132 F.3d 320, 330 (6th Cir.1997). For a defendant\u2019s statements during a custodial interrogation to be admissible, the government must demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights prior to questioning. <em>United States v. Nichols, </em>512 F.3d 789, 798 (6th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b944-11\">1. Kellogg\u2019s Intoxication Claim</p>\n<p id=\"b944-12\">Kellogg contends that he was under the influence of Xanax at the time he was questioned by officers and that he therefore could not consent to a waiver of his rights at any point during his interaction with police, either in signing the consent to search form, or in signing his waiver of rights form on the way to Chattanooga. \u201cEvidence that a defendant suffered, at the relevant time, from a condition or deficiency that impaired his cognitive or volitional capacity is never, by itself, sufficient to warrant the conclusion that his confession was involuntary for purposes of due process; some element of police coercion is always necessary.\u201d <em>United States v. Neuman, </em>889 F.2d 88, 94 (6th Cir.1989). Kellogg has not presented evidence refuting the testimony of Melia and Ruffin \u2014 who both said that he was coherent and appropriately responsive \u2014 or evidence that Melia and Ruffin coerced him into waiving his rights at any point. Thus, the district court\u2019s rejection of Kellogg\u2019s intoxication claim was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p id=\"b944-13\">2. Kellogg\u2019s Response to Consent to Search Request</p>\n<p id=\"b944-14\">Kellogg contends that, because Melia and Ruffin did not inform him of his <em>Miranda </em>rights prior to asking for his consent to search the duplex, his state<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"923\">*923</page-number>ment that anything illegal in the apartment was his, and that Huckabee should not be blamed, should have been suppressed.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-5\">\u201cA suspect is in custody for purposes of receiving <em>Miranda </em>protection if there has been a \u2018formal arrest or restraint of movement.\u2019 \u201d <em>Mason v. Mitchell, </em>320 F.3d 604, 631 (6th Cir.2003) (quoting <em>Oregon v. Mathiasm, </em>429 U.S. 492, 495, 97 S.Ct. 711, 50 L.Ed.2d 714 (1977)). It is undisputed that Kellogg was in custody for purposes of the <em>Miranda </em>inquiry when Melia sought Kellogg\u2019s consent to search the duplex.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-6\">Interrogation is defined as \u201cexpress questioning ... [and] any words or actions on the part of police ... that the police should know are reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect.\u201d <em>Rhode Island v. Innis, </em>446 U.S. 291, 301, 100 S.Ct. 1682, 64 L.Ed.2d 297 (1980). A simple request to search cannot be reasonably expected to elicit anything more than a \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno,\u201d and thus is not an interrogation. <em>United States v. Kellogg, </em>202 Fed.Appx. 96, 103 (6th Cir.2006)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> ; <em>see also United States v. Glenna, </em>878 F.2d 967, 971 (7th Cir.1989) (\u201c[Although the district court believed that the officers\u2019 request for consent ... was \u2018reasonably likely to evoke an incriminating response\u2019 and therefore ran afoul of <em>Miranda, </em>every federal circuit court that has addressed the question has reached the opposite conclusion.\u201d) (citation omitted) (collecting cases). Whether the agents \u201cinterrogated\u201d Kellogg is an issue of fact this Court reviews for clear error. <em>United States v. Sangineto-Miranda, </em>859 F.2d 1501, 1512 (6th Cir. 1988).</p>\n<p id=\"b945-7\">After introducing himself and Ruffin to Kellogg, Melia immediately requested Kellogg\u2019s consent to search the duplex and asked Kellogg to sign the consent form. These requests did not constitute an \u201cinterrogation,\u201d because they were not \u201creasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from [Kellogg].\u201d <em>See Clark, </em>982 F.2d at 968 (internal quotations and citation omitted). Rather, as the magistrate judge correctly observed, Melia should have reasonably expected a \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d from Kellogg in response to those questions. <em>Kellogg, </em>2006 WL 3196902, at *8. Accordingly, because the district court did not err in finding that Kellogg was not \u201cinterrogated\u201d for purposes of <em>Miranda, </em>it properly denied Kellogg\u2019s motion to suppress his statement taking responsibility for anything illegal in the apartment.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-10\">3. Statements Confirming Contraband in Kellogg\u2019s Residence</p>\n<p id=\"b945-11\">Unlike his request for consent to search, Melia\u2019s questions to Kellogg regarding the existence and location of the gun used during the robbery and the cash box taken from the bank during the robbery constituted an interrogation. A reasonable officer would know that such questions were likely to elicit an incriminating response. <em>See Innis, </em>446 U.S. at 301, 100 S.Ct. 1682. Thus, consistent with the Fifth Amendment, officers were required to inform Kellogg of his constitutional rights and to obtain a waiver of those rights in order for the incriminating statements to be admitted at trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b945-12\">Melia and Ruffin both testified that they could not recall whether Kellogg signed the <em>Miranda </em>waiver form prior to their departure for Chattanooga. Moreover, the magistrate judge noted that, although Melia testified that he generally reads arrested suspects their <em>Miranda </em>rights before questioning them, he did not testify that he considered his questions regarding the location of contraband in the house to be \u201cquestioning.\u201d <em>Kellogg, </em>2006 WL 3196902, at *8. Based on this record, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"924\">*924</page-number>magistrate judge\u2019s finding that it was <em>\u201cnot </em>clear as to whether Kellogg was given a <em>Miranda </em>warning and waived his rights\u201d prior to the interrogation was not clearly erroneous (emphasis supplied). Because the government has failed to demonstrate by the preponderance of the evidence that Kellogg waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights before this questioning began, <em>see Nichols, </em>512 F.3d at 798, this Court finds that Kellogg\u2019s statements identifying the location of contraband and robbery evidence in the duplex must be suppressed, absent an applicable exception. <em>Clark, </em>982 F.2d at 967-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b946-4\">As the magistrate judge noted, \u201cthere is a \u2018public safety\u2019 exception to the requirement that <em>Miranda </em>warnings be given before a suspect\u2019s answers may be admitted into evidence.\u201d <em>Quarles, </em>467 U.S. at 655, 104 S.Ct. 2626. The \u201cpublic safety\u201d exception applies to \u201ca situation in which police officers ask questions reasonably prompted by a concern for public safety.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 656, 104 S.Ct. 2626. This Court evaluates the reasonableness of an officer\u2019s belief that either the public or law enforcement officers were in danger <em>de novo. United States v. Williams, </em>483 F.3d 425, 428 (6th Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-5\">In determining the applicability of the public safety exception, this Court considers factors including \u201cthe known history and characteristics of the suspect, the known facts and circumstances of the alleged crime, and the facts and circumstances confronted by the officer when he undertakes the arrest.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 428. However,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b946-6\">\u201c[f]or an officer to have a reasonable belief that he [or the public] is in danger, at a minimum, he must have reason to believe (1) that the defendant might have (or recently have had) a weapon, and (2) that someone other than police might gain access to the weapon and inflict harm with it. The public safety exception is applied if and only if both of those two conditions are satisfied and no other context-specific evidence rebuts the inference that the officer reasonably could have perceived a threat to public safety.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b946-8\"><em>Id. </em>In <em>Williams, </em>where an arresting officer believed a gun to be in the defendant\u2019s room, this Court noted that \u201cif one were to believe that [the defendant] was seated outside of his room and handcuffed when an officer questioned him ... then the officers could not have had an objectively reasonable fear for their safety and the public safety exception would not apply.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 429. <em>See also United States v. Brathwaite, </em>458 F.3d 376, 382 n. 8 (5th Cir.2006) (rejecting application of public safety exception where police secured the suspect and his co-residents, conducted two security sweeps and gained control over the residence).</p>\n<p id=\"b946-9\">The public safety exception does not apply to the questioning of Kellogg about the contraband and robbery evidence in the duplex. The suspicion that Kellogg had recently committed a bank robbery at gunpoint was enough to satisfy the first prong of the <em>Williams </em>standard, i.e., that he might have had a weapon in the duplex. However, since the arresting officers had just ordered all of the occupants out of the duplex, handcuffed Kellogg and conducted a security sweep of the residence, there was no reason to believe that a weapon would be immediately accessible to individuals other than police. Thus, the immediate danger to the officers or the public was insufficient to justify the officers\u2019 failure to inform Kellogg of his rights prior to eliciting incriminating statements regarding the items in the duplex. <em>See Williams, </em>483 F.3d at 429 (finding officer\u2019s knowledge of the violent crime defendant was alleged to have just committed insufficient to justify a belief that the officer or the public was in danger).</p>\n<p id=\"b947-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"925\">*925</page-number>Moreover, in addition to asking Kellogg where the gun was, Melia also asked for the location of drugs and evidence from the bank robbery, neither of which could have been directed at alleviating the immediate danger of the situation. Certainly, those questions were \u201cdesigned solely to elicit testimonial evidence from a suspect,\u201d <em>Quarles, </em>467 U.S. at 658-59, 104 S.Ct. 2626, and further undermine the government\u2019s argument that the officers acted out of safety concerns alone.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-5\">This Court therefore finds that Kellogg\u2019s statements concerning the location of contraband and bank robbery evidence in the duplex violated his Fifth Amendment rights, and the district court erred in denying Kellogg\u2019s motion to suppress those statements.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-6\">II.

Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b947-10\">\u201cRule 403 governs whether evidence that is relevant under Federal Rule of Evidence 401 is admissible.\u201d <em>United States v. Caver, </em>470 F.3d 220, 240 (6th Cir.2006). \u201cAlthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.\u201d Fed.R.Evid. 403. The district court has \u201cvery broad\u201d discretion in weighing the evidence under Rule 403. <em>Caver, </em>470 F.3d at 240. \u201cThe term \u2018unfair prejudice,\u2019 as to a criminal defendant, speaks to the capacity of some concededly relevant evidence to lure the factfinder into declaring guilt on a ground different from proof specific to the offense charged.\u201d <em>Old Chief v. United States, </em>519 U.S. 172, 180, 117 S.Ct. 644, 136 L.Ed.2d 574 (1997) (citation omitted). Unfair prejudice \u201crefers to the evidence which tends to suggest [a] decision on an improper basis.\u201d <em>Caver, </em>470 F.3d at 240. Such an improper basis is \u201ccommonly, though not necessarily, an emotional one.\u201d <em>Old Chief, </em>519 U.S. at 180, 117 S.Ct. 644.</p>\n<p id=\"b947-12\">One factor in the \u201cRule 403 balancing is the availability of other means of proof, which would reduce the need for the potentially confusing evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Merriweather, </em>78 F.3d 1070, 1077 (6th Cir.1996). \u201cAnother consideration ... is whether the \u2018reverberating clang\u2019 \u201d of the prejudicial nature of the evidence will \u201cdrown [the] weaker sound\u201d of the probative value of the evidence. <em>Id. </em>(quoting <em>Shepard v. United States, </em>290 U.S. 96, 104, 54 S.Ct. 22, 78 L.Ed. 196 (1933)).</p>\n<p id=\"b947-13\">The district court initially determined that the only admissible testimony concerning the bank robbery was Melia\u2019s statement that he was called to the duplex because he was investigating Kellogg\u2019s role in \u201canother crime.\u201d The government argues that Kellogg\u2019s testimony opened the door to the more detailed testimony on the bank robbery by challenging Melia\u2019s credi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"926\">*926</page-number>bility and by putting his own credibility at issue. However, maximizing the probative value of the evidence of the bank robbery and minimizing its prejudicial nature, <em>see Zipkin, </em>729 F.2d at 389, this Court believes the district court abused its discretion in allowing the government to present as much evidence of the robbery as it did.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-4\">As a preliminary matter, although the government contends the testimony of the bank teller and the FBI agent investigating the bank robbery were necessary to rebut Kellogg\u2019s testimony, the government introduced prejudicial testimony concerning the robbery before Kellogg even took the stand. During Melia\u2019s direct testimony, he stated that Kellogg had told him that forensic testing of the gun found at the duplex would match the shot \u201cfired during the other crime I was investigating.\u201d This statement was highly prejudicial, as it informed the jury that Kellogg may have been involved in a recent shooting; the fact that a shot had been fired was of little to no probative value in proving that Kellogg possessed the gun in the duplex.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-5\">During his testimony, Kellogg accused Melia, in claiming that Kellogg admitted the gun and drugs were his, of \u201cstretching the truth,\u201d and denied that Melia had ever questioned him about the gun. Certainly, the government was entitled to rebut that testimony by allowing Melia to testify as to some of the details of his interrogation of Kellogg in the FBI office that contradicted Kellogg\u2019s account.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-6\">However, the court went too far in allowing a lengthy narrative of the bank robbery to be presented at trial. The bank teller testified in great detail about the course of the robbery \u2014 including that the robber pointed a gun at her, threatened to kill her, and jumped onto the counter to force her to hand over the money. Moreover, the jury was presented with strong evidence that Kellogg was the bank robber: the teller, who had closely interacted with the bank robber, identified Kellogg as the robber; the FBI agent who had investigated the robbery testified that the robber\u2019s Yankees hat and wristwatch were found at the duplex, as were shoes matching a shoe print the robber had left on the bank counter; the FBI agent also testified that ammunition matching the shot fired during the robbery was found in Kellogg\u2019s car in Guntersville; and Melia testified that Kellogg confessed to the bank robbery at the FBI office. The unmistakable conclusion to draw from all of this testimony was that Kellogg, on trial for gun and drug possession, had menacingly robbed a bank at gunpoint just a few days earlier. While this evidence may have been somewhat probative as to whether the gun found at the duplex was Kellogg\u2019s and whether it had traveled in interstate commerce, it was unfairly prejudicial because of its \u201cimproper basis:\u201d to convince the jury that Kellogg was a bank robber, on the loose and dangerous. <em>See Caver, </em>470 F.3d at 240. In our view, the evidence of the bank robbery likely \u201cdrown[ed] [the] weaker sound\u201d of Kellogg\u2019s gun possession, and could have led the jury to convict him based on a crime for which he was not charged. <em>See Merriweather, </em>78 F.3d at 1077; <em>Old Chief, </em>519 U.S. at 180,117 S.Ct. 644.</p>\n<p id=\"b948-8\">Further, the government presented plenty of other evidence proving Kellogg\u2019s possession of the gun \u2014 including its discovery at the duplex where he was staying and his statement to Melia at the FBI office that the gun was the same one fired during the other crime \u2014 and also presented unrebutted testimony that the gun had been manufactured in Arkansas. Thus, to the extent that the bank robbery evidence was admitted simply to rebut Kellogg\u2019s assertion that he did not possess the gun, or to prove that the gun had traveled in interstate commerce, it was largely unnec<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"927\">*927</page-number>essary. <em>See Merriweather, </em>78 F.3d at 1077.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-5\">\u201cA limiting instruction will minimize to some degree the prejudicial nature of other criminal acts; it is not, however, a surefire panacea for the prejudice resulting from needless admission of such evidence.\u201d <em>United States v. Haywood, </em>280 F.3d 715, 724 (6th Cir.2002). Although the district court instructed the jury not to consider the bank robbery as evidence of Kellogg\u2019s guilt for the crimes charged, the sheer weight of the evidence that was introduced regarding the robbery would have likely undermined that instruction in the mind of a reasonable juror.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-6\">Accordingly, this Court finds that the district court abused its discretion in admitting so much evidence of the bank robbery. The district court must conduct a new trial to remedy its error.</p>\n<p id=\"b949-7\">III. Identification of Kellogg as Guntersville Bank Robber</p>\n<p id=\"b949-8\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b949-9\">This Court reviews the admission of in-court identification testimony for abuse of discretion. <em>United States v. Hill, </em>967 F.2d 226, 230 (6th Cir.1992).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-11\">B. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b949-12\">The introduction of an unreliable identification of a defendant obtained through impermissibly suggestive procedures violates the defendant\u2019s right to due process. <em>Moore v. Illinois, </em>434 U.S. 220, 227, 98 S.Ct. 458, 54 L.Ed.2d 424 (1977). To determine whether identification evidence is admissible, this Court must first ask whether the \u201cidentification procedure was impermissibly suggestive.\u201d <em>United States v. Hill, </em>967 F.2d 226, 230 (6th Cir. 1992). Should the identification procedure be found impermissibly suggestive, this Court must determine \u201cwhether, under the totality of the circumstances, the testimony was nevertheless reliable.\u201d <em>Id. </em>An analysis of five factors guides the reliability determination: (1) the witness\u2019 opportunity to view the suspect at the time of the crime; (2) the witness\u2019 degree of attention; (3) the accuracy of the witness\u2019 prior description of the suspect; (4) the level of certainty displayed by the witness during the confrontation; and (5) the length of time between the crime and the confrontation. <em>Neil v. Biggers, </em>409 U.S. 188,199, 93 S.Ct. 375, 34 L.Ed.2d 401 (1972); <em>see Hill, </em>967 F.2d 226, 232 (applying <em>Biggers </em>factors to witness\u2019 in-court identification). \u201cAgainst these factors is to be weighed the corrupting effect of the suggestive identification itself.\u201d <em>Manson v. Brathwaite, </em>432 U.S. 98, 114, 97 S.Ct. 2243, 53 L.Ed.2d 140 (1977). However, \u201c[a]s long as there is not a substantial likelihood of misidentification, it is the function of the jury to determine the ultimate weight to be given to the identification.\u201d <em>United States v. Causey, </em>834 F.2d 1277, 1285 (6th Cir.1987) (quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-15\">The bank teller\u2019s in-court identification of Kellogg was not in response to any question from the prosecutor, who never asked her to identify the robber and had only asked her whether or not the bank robber was visible in one of the photos he was showing her. Accordingly, while the bank teller\u2019s sudden ability to identify the bank robber in the courtroom might raise a credibility issue, the identification does not appear to have derived from any suggestive <em>procedure, </em>and therefore did not violate Kellogg\u2019s due process rights. <em>See Hill, </em>967 F.2d at 230; <em>Causey, </em>834 F.2d at 1286 (\u201cThe prior failure of the witness to identify the defendant goes only to the weight to be accorded testimony, not its admissibility.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b949-16\">Moreover, even if the prosecutor\u2019s questioning of the bank teller could be considered suggestive, the identification seemed to be reliable enough that the district court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"928\">*928</page-number>did not abuse its discretion by allowing it. The bank teller, as the employee who had to listen and respond to the robber\u2019s demands, had ample opportunity to view the robber and pay close attention to him at the time of robbery. She testified that she \u201clooked up at his face\u201d when he handed her a robbery note, and exchanged several words with him before handing him the cash drawer. At trial, she demonstrated a detailed memory of the robbery before seeing the photos of the robbery scene, describing the robber\u2019s gun, his clothing and his movements in detail. While her prior description of the robber \u2014 that he was a tall black man with \u201cmedium complexion\u201d \u2014 was somewhat vague, its accuracy had not been questioned. She did not express any doubt that Kellogg was the robber, repeating twice that she recognized him sitting in the courtroom. Therefore, although significant time had elapsed since the robbery, the other <em>Biggers </em>factors tend to support the reliability of the identification. The district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the identification.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b950-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we REVERSE in part and AFFIRM in part the judgment of the district court, and REMAND the case to the district court with instructions to provide Kellogg a new trial.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b945-8\">. The defendant in the cited case is not the defendant appealing this action.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b950-6\">KETHLEDGE, Circuit Judge,</author>\n<p id=\"A8DH\">dissenting.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-7\">I respectfully disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that the district court\u2019s admission of evidence regarding Kellogg\u2019s involvement in a bank robbery requires a new trial in this case. The core issue at trial was whether the gun found at the duplex belonged to Kellogg. He took the stand to deny that fact, and to impugn generally the credibility of the government\u2019s lead witness, FBI Agent Melia. Having done so, it was fair game for the government to rebut Kellogg\u2019s testimony with proof that Kellogg used the same gun in a bank robbery only a few days before the gun was found. Virtually all of the evidence cited by the majority was admitted for precisely this purpose. That evidence did not merely show that Kellogg was a dangerous man; it instead all but certainly established that <em>the gun was his. </em>Which is to say, the evidence was highly relevant to the basic factual dispute in the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-9\">It is a tall order, then, for this court to say that the district court abused its discretion in admitting that evidence. That is particularly true given that \u2014 in an abundance of caution \u2014 the district court initially <em>excluded, </em>most of the evidence now cited by the majority. That evidence only came in when Kellogg chose to throw down the gauntlet in his own testimony \u2014 again, concerning the basic factual dispute in the case. I do not think the government was required to sit on evidence that proved Kellogg wrong.</p>\n<p id=\"b950-10\">All that said, I recognize that this case is a close one. The government\u2019s evidence on rebuttal was more colorful than necessary to prove that Kellogg used the gun in the prior robbery. But on balance, I think the admission of the cited evidence fell within the discretion afforded the district court. I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
