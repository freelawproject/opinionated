We conclude that the District Court erroneously applied New Jersey\u2019s entire controversy doctrine to bar the plaintiffs suit. Accordingly, we will reverse and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b746-17\">In May 2002, plaintiff (\u201cowner\u201d) filed a complaint in New Jersey state court to recover damages on a defaulted lease. The court entered summary judgment on liability against defendant (\u201ctenant\u201d) \u201cfor amounts due under the Lease through January 31, 2006\u201d and ordered that the matter \u201cproceed for a determination of damages due [owner].\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b746-18\">The lease provided choices for the recovery of damages in the event of default. Owner could seek back rent payable \u201cin monthly installments ... on the rent days specified in this Lease and any suit brought to collect the amount of the deficiency for any month [would] not prejudice in any way the rights of [owner] to collect the deficiency for any subsequent month by a similar proceeding.\u201d As an alternative, owner could pursue accelerated rent, <em>i.e., </em>\u201can amount equal to the difference <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"725\">*725</page-number>between the ... [rent] from the date of [the tenant\u2019s] default to the date of expiration of the [lease\u2019s] Term ... and the then fair and reasonable rental value (inclusive of ... [rent]) of the ... Premises for the same period.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b747-5\">Before the trial on damages began, tenant moved <em>in limine </em>to limit owner to the accelerated rent option. In denying the motion, the New Jersey court held that the terms of the lease allowed the issue of damages to \u201cbe addressed seriatim.\u201d The judge explained to counsel:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-6\">\u201cThere clearly has been liability determined by [the previous judge] that ... the [tenant], in fact, is liable up to inclusive of 2006. That\u2019s clear....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-7\">\u201cWe do find, in addition thereto, that there are two options for being relieved or being addressed in damages at this point: [ (1) ] ... [that] spells out for back rent at that time or which is less global or [ (2) ] for the rents projected.... [The second option] does require an expert [to prove]. There is no expert here and there is no judicial estoppel because those are the two options [owner] had.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-8\">\u201cAlthough the entire controversy rationale does \u2014 would indicate that we should resolve this all in one fell swoop, unfortunately with these leases in the [commercial context] as they were, they can be addressed seriatim.... [G]iven the terms of the lease, there is no judicial estoppel. [The previous judge] did not rule on anything other than liability attaching for the full period of time.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-9\">\u201cIt is up to the [owner] then, by their measure of proof, to prove that there is a quantum of damages, be that for the total period of 2006 or some salient portion thereof. The portion that they have elected to proceed with ... is up to August 1 st of 2003.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-10\">\u201cThey\u2019ve elected to go with back rent.... [T]here is no misleading [here]----</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b747-11\">\u201cThey\u2019ve also indicated ... that they ... will endeavor to prove damages to August the 1st, 200[3]----[T]his is one of the elections that [the] parties negotiated at arms length.... [The] application <em>[in limine </em>] is denied at this point.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AWI\">The matter then proceeded to a trial on damages. At its conclusion, the court filed an order that \u201cJudgment be ... entered in favor of [owner] Aldrich ... and against [tenant] Foot Locker ... for $1,150,632.75.\u201d Tenant appealed to the Appellate Division of the New Jersey Superior Court. There, tenant challenged the \u201corder granting partial summary judgment to plaintiff as to liability, a pre-trial ruling barring the report and testimony of an expert on behalf of [tenant], and some evidentiary rulings during the trial.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b747-14\">In November 2005, the Appellate Division concluded that the \u201ctrial court was correct to decide the liability issue on summary judgment\u201d and agreed with the evidentiary rulings. The court saw \u201cno merit sufficient to warrant further discussion\u201d of the remaining issues on appeal. There was no discussion of the seriatim damage ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b747-15\">In July 2006, owner filed a second complaint in the New Jersey court to obtain the remaining damages under the lease. Invoking diversity jurisdiction, tenant removed the action to the District Court for the District of New Jersey and filed a motion to dismiss asserting a violation of New Jersey\u2019s entire controversy doctrine and <em>res judicata.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b747-16\">The District Court granted the tenant\u2019s motion to dismiss. Explaining that the entire controversy doctrine controlled, the Court found it unnecessary to determine whether <em>res judicata </em>also precluded the owner\u2019s suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"726\">*726</page-number>Owner appealed and now argues that the District Court erroneously applied the entire controversy doctrine to bar the 2006 suit. Tenant counters that the District Court properly granted the motion to dismiss because both the entire controversy doctrine and <em>res judicata </em>prohibited owner from bringing the second action.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-4\">State court decisions are given \u201cthe same preclusive effect in federal court they would be given in the courts of the rendering state.\u201d <em>Del. River Port Auth. v. Fraternal Order of Police, Penn-Jersey Lodge SO, </em>290 F.3d 567, 573 (3d Cir.2002). Accordingly, we look to the preclusion law of New Jersey. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b748-5\">The entire controversy doctrine \u201crequires that a person assert in one action all related claims against a particular adversary or be precluded from bringing a second action based on the omitted claims against that party.\u201d <em>In re Mullarkey, </em>536 F.3d 215, 229 (3d Cir.2008) (quoting <em>Melikian v. Corradetti, </em>791 F.2d 274, 279 (3d Cir.1986)). \u201c[A] party cannot withhold part of a controversy for later litigation even when the withheld component is a separate and independently cognizable cause of action.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<blockquote id=\"b748-7\">Exceptions to the doctrine exist. It \u201cdoes not require that all claims and parties proceed to culmination in one litigation. Rather, all claims and parties must initially be joined together before one court. The court can determine for itself how best to proceed with the various claims and parties. In order to exercise this discretion, however, the court must be fully informed of the extent of the controversy before it.\u201d</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A2o\"><em>Petrocelli v. Daniel Woodhead Co., </em>993 F.2d 27, 31 (3d Cir.1993); <em>DiTrolio v. Antiles, </em>142 N.J. 253, 662 A.2d 494, 504-05 (1995). Thus, where a trial court \u201chas expressly reserved the plaintiffs right to maintain [a] second action or where [the court\u2019s] rulings on related issues indicate it was likely to have reserved that right, the preclusive effect of the entire controversy [doctrine] does not apply.\u201d <em>DiIorio v. Structual Stone &amp; Brick Co., </em>368 N.J.Super. 134, 845 A.2d 658, 661 (N.J.Super.Ct.App.Div.2004); <em>see also Brown v. Brown, </em>208 N.J.Super. 372, 506 A.2d 29, 35-36 (N.J.Super.Ct.App.Div.1986) (the doctrine does not apply when \u201cthe court in the first action has expressly reserved the plaintiffs right to maintain the second action\u201d (quoting Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 26(l)(b))).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-9\">A party\u2019s \u201cconduct may [also] estop him from relying on\u201d the entire controversy doctrine. <em>Brown, </em>506 A.2d at 35. Exempt from \u201cthe claim-splitting bar [are] those claims as to which \u2018the parties have agreed in terms or in effect that the plaintiff may split his claim, or the defendant has acquiesced therein.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>(quoting Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 26(l)(a)).</p>\n<p id=\"b748-10\">Our review of the record convinces us that the District Court erred in concluding that the entire controversy doctrine barred the owner\u2019s 2006 suit against tenant. All claims and parties had been joined in 2002 before the New Jersey trial judge, who understood the full extent of the controversy between the parties, exercised his discretion to allow owner to seek only back rent at that time, and preserved the owner\u2019s ability to pursue damages in the future. Accordingly, the District Court should not have applied the entire controversy doctrine to grant the tenant\u2019s motion to dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b748-11\">Though not addressed by the District Court, we find <em>res judicata </em>to be equally inapplicable. <em>\u201c[R]es judicata </em>refers ... to the common-law doctrine barring relitigation of claims or issues that have already been adjudicated.\u201d <em>Velasquez v. Franz, </em>123 N.J. 498, 589 A.2d 143, 147 (1991) (internal quotation marks omitted). New Jersey applies <em>res judicata </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"727\">*727</page-number>\u201cwhen three circumstances are present: \u2018(1) a final judgment on the merits in a prior suit involving (2) the same parties or their privies and (3) a subsequent suit based on the same cause of action.\u2019 \u201d <em>In re Mullarkey, </em>536 F.3d at 225 (quoting <em>Post v. Hartford Ins. Co., </em>501 F.3d 154, 169 (3d Cir.2007)).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-5\">A matter has been actually litigated when the \u201cissue [wa]s properly raised, by the pleadings or otherwise, and is submitted for determination, and is determined.\u201d <em>Velasquez, </em>589 A.2d at 147 (quoting Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 27 cmt. d). Furthermore, we have determined that in New Jersey <em>res judicata </em>would not bar a successive suit when a trial judge has \u201cexpressly preserved ... claims for a future action.\u201d <em>Venuto v. Witco Corp., </em>117 F.3d 754, 758 (3d Cir. 1997); <em>see also </em>Restatement (Second) of Judgments \u00a7 26 cmt. b (\u201cA determination by the court that its judgment is \u2018without prejudice\u2019 (or words to that effect) to a second action on the omitted part of the claim ... should ordinarily be given effect in the second action\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b749-6\">The record reveals that the judgment in the 2002 action established the tenant\u2019s liability through January 31, 2006, but awarded damages only for the period up to August 1, 2003. Losses from August 2, 2003, though January 31, 2006, were not submitted for determination nor included in the judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-7\">Therefore, a New Jersey court would not have used <em>res judicata </em>as a basis for granting the tenant\u2019s motion to dismiss. A final judgment as to all of the damages due to owner did not exist at the culmination of the 2002 suit, and owner had received permission to pursue a future action for the amounts owed from August 2, 2003, to January 31, 2006.</p>\n<p id=\"b749-8\">Accordingly, the District Court erred in granting the tenant\u2019s motion to dismiss. Because neither the entire controversy doctrine nor <em>res judicata </em>bar the owner\u2019s 2006 action, we will reverse and remand with directions that the tenant\u2019s motion to dismiss be denied.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
