Dep\u2019t of Veterans Affairs, </em>AT-0752-08-0051-I-1 (M.S.P.B. Feb. 15, 2008). Because the Board\u2019s decision was in accordance with law and supported by substantial evidence, we <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b625-15\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b625-16\">Abrams worked as a kinesiotherapist at the VA Medical Center in Memphis, TN. As a kinesiotherapist, Abrams prescribed and oversaw exercise treatments for veterans. On October 5, 2007, the Agency removed Abrams from his position on charges that he had engaged in a prohibited relationship with a patient and had committed patient abuse.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-17\">The charges stemmed from Abrams\u2019 relationship with Felicia Dukes, one of Abrams\u2019 patients. According to Dukes, she and Abrams had a five-year sexual relationship during the time that Dukes was being treated by Abrams. Sometime in 2006 Dukes contacted Abrams\u2019 supervisors and the VA police, alleging that Abrams had begun harassing her because of the breakup of their relationship. In October 2006, Dukes requested, and was assigned, a new therapist.</p>\n<p id=\"b625-18\">Abrams admitted that he and Dukes had a personal relationship, but denied that the relationship was of a sexual nature. Abrams claims that his and Dukes\u2019 relationship was limited to periodic kinesiotherapy group dinners, talking on the phone, accepting meals from her at his workplace, and occasionally attending church together. Abrams stated that his relationship with Dukes ended in October 2006 when he was instructed by his employer as well as the VA police to cease contact with Dukes.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"604\">*604</page-number>After the Agency removed him in October 2007, Abrams appealed the decision to the Board. In an initial decision dated February 15, 2008, an administrative judge affirmed the Agency\u2019s removal decision. The AJ found that Abrams and Dukes had engaged in a sexual relationship. That conclusion was based primarily on witness credibility determinations; the AJ found Dukes\u2019 testimony to be more persuasive than Abrams\u2019. Thus, the AJ found that because Abrams engaged in a prohibited sexual relationship, the Agency\u2019s removal decision was appropriate. However, the AJ did not sustain the Agency\u2019s alternative ground for removal: patient abuse. The AJ found insufficient evidence to support the Agency\u2019s charge that Abrams had harassed Dukes.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-4\">Thus, although only one of the Agency\u2019s charges against Abrams was sustained, the AJ upheld the decision to remove Abrams. The AJ upheld the Agency\u2019s removal decision based upon Abrams\u2019 behavior, his lack of potential for rehabilitation, and his past disciplinary record. The Board denied Abrams\u2019 petition for review; thus, the AJ\u2019s decision became final.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-5\">Abrams timely appealed the Board\u2019s denial. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b626-7\">The scope of our review in an appeal from a Board decision is limited. We can only set aside the Board\u2019s decision if it was \u201c(1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c) (2000); <em>see Briggs v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., </em>331 F.3d 1307, 1311 (Fed.Cir.2003). This court reviews rulings on evidentiary matters under an abuse of discretion standard. <em>Banknote Corp. of Am., Inc. v. United States, </em>365 F.3d 1345, 1358 (Fed.Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b626-9\">On appeal, Abrams resumes his claims that he never engaged in a sexual relationship with Dukes and that the AJ\u2019s decision was based entirely on \u201cshe said testimony.\u201d He further argues that he should be reinstated because the VA did not respond to his requests for VA policies regarding prohibited socialization with patients.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-10\">In response, the government contends that the evidence established that Dukes and Abrams had a sexual relationship and that such relationships were prohibited by the VA. Furthermore, the government argues that the AJ is given wide discretion regarding discovery requests and there is no evidence that that discretion was abused in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-11\">We agree with the government. This case hinges on the conflicting testimony of Dukes and Abrams. The former claimed that the pair engaged in a five-year affair that ended only after police and the VA intervened. The latter claimed that the relationship was strictly platonic. The AJ found Dukes\u2019 testimony to be \u201cmore persuasive\u201d than Abrams\u2019. This court will not overturn credibility determinations unless the testimony was \u201cinherently improbable or discredited by undisputed evidence or physical facts.\u201d <em>Hanratty v. Dep\u2019t of Transp., </em>819 F.2d 286, 288 (Fed.Cir.1987) (citation omitted). Abrams has not pointed to anything in Dukes\u2019 testimony that has been discredited or is inherently improbable. Thus, due to our deferential standard of review of credibility determinations, we must uphold the AJ\u2019s finding that Dukes and Abrams engaged in a sexual relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b626-12\">Abrams\u2019 argument that the AJ erred by refusing to grant his discovery request is similarly flawed. Abrams has not shown that the failure of the AJ to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"605\">*605</page-number>grant his discovery request was prejudicial to him. In fact, his discovery request only sought information as to the VA\u2019s policy regarding social relations with patients. In this case, it has already been established by the AJ that Abrams\u2019 relationship with Dukes was not of merely a \u201csocial\u201d nature; thus, the request for such a policy was irrelevant. <em>See Curtin v. Office of Pers. Mgmt., </em>846 F.2d 1373 (Fed.Cir.1988) (finding that an AJ may exclude irrelevant evidence). It was uncontested at the AJ\u2019s healing that sexual relationships with patients were prohibited by the VA. Therefore, Abrams\u2019 discovery request was properly denied by the AJ.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-5\">Accordingly, we <em>affirm </em>the Board\u2019s decision.</p>\n<p id=\"b627-6\">COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b627-7\">\n<em>No costs.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
