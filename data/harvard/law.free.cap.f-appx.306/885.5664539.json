Because Gomez-Caldera had a prior conviction for a drug-trafficking offense, his offense level was adjusted upward by 16 levels pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(A)(i). Gomez-Caldera requested a sentence at the bottom of the 57-to-71-month range of imprisonment under the Guidelines. The district court sentenced Gomez-Caldera to a 60-month term of imprisonment and a three-year term of supervised release.</p>\n<p id=\"b908-17\">Gomez-Caldera contends that his sentence was greater than necessary to accomplish the goals of sentencing listed in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a)(2). Gomez-Caldera concedes that this court ordinarily applies a presumption of reasonableness to within-guideline sentences. <em>See United States v. Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d 337, 338 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 129 S.Ct. 328, 172 L.Ed.2d 236 (2008); <em>United States v. Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d 554, 565-66 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 129 S.Ct. 624, 172 L.Ed.2d 617 (2008). Citing <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>\u2014U.S.\u2014, 128 S.Ct. 558, 574-75, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), he contends that the presumption should not apply in this case because \u00a7 2L1.2 is not empirically supported. Gomez-Caldera points out that the instant offense did not involve violent conduct and did not pose a danger to others and \u201cwas, at bottom, an international trespass.\u201d He contends also that the guidelines range did not account for his motivation for reentering the United States \u2014 to \u201cearn money.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b908-24\">The question presented in <em>Kimbrough </em>was whether \u201ca sentence ... outside the guidelines range is per se unreasonable when it is based on a disagreement with the sentencing disparity for crack and powder cocaine offenses.\u201d 128 S.Ct. at 564. Speaking specifically to the crack cocaine Guidelines, the Court simply ruled that \u201cit would not be an abuse of discretion for a district court to conclude when sentencing a particular defendant that the crack/powder disparity yields a sentence <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"887\">*887</page-number>\u2018greater than necessary\u2019 to achieve \u00a7 3558(a)\u2019s purposes, even in a mine-run case.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 575. In <em>Kimbrough, </em>the Court said nothing of the applicability of the presumption of reasonableness. Moreover, the appellate presumption\u2019s continued applicability to \u00a7 2L1.2 sentences is supported by this court\u2019s decision in <em>Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d at 338-39. The appellate presumption is therefore applicable in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b909-5\">The district court considered Gomez-Caldera\u2019s request for leniency in light of his personal circumstances, but it ultimately determined that a sentence at the bottom of the guidelines range was not appropriate. We note that the 60-month sentence was near the bottom of the applicable guidelines range. Gomez-Caldera\u2019s within-guidelines sentence is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of reasonableness. <em>See Campos-Maldonado, </em>531 F.3d at 338; <em>Gomez-Herrera, </em>523 F.3d at 565-66. Because Gomez-Caldera has failed to make a showing sufficient to rebut that presumption, the district court\u2019s judgment is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b908-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be' published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
