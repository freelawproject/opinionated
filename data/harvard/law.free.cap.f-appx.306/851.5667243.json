She was sentenced to two years of probation. As a special condition of her supervision while on probation, Davis was ordered to \u201cparticipate in a mental health program as deemed necessary and approved by the probation officer.\u201d Davis appeals, arguing that the district judge unlawfully and unconstitutionally delegated his statutory and Article III authority to determine sentencing conditions to a non-judicial officer.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-11\">Because Davis did not object at sentencing, this court reviews for plain error only. To show plain error, Davis must show an error that is clear or obvious and that affects her substantial rights. <em>United States v. Baker, </em>538 F.3d 324, 332 (5th Cir.2008). If she makes such a showing, this court has the discretion to correct the error but only if it seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b874-16\">Davis cites primarily <em>United States v. Albro, </em>32 F.3d 173 (5th Cir.1994), to support her position that the district judge plainly erred by delegating his authority to determine special conditions of release to a probation officer. In that case, Albro was convicted of bank fraud and ordered to pay restitution. Although the district judge himself determined the amount to be paid, he delegated the \u201cmanner of payment\u201d to a probation officer. We agreed with Albro that \u201c \u2018the amounts to be paid and the manner of payment should be recited in the [sentencing] order, rather than delegating these details to the probation officer.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 174 (citations omitted). We found plain error and reversed.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-17\">In <em>United States v. Warden, </em>this court held that it was not plain error to allow a probation officer to determine a. defendant\u2019s ability to pay for drug treatment; <em>Albro </em>concerned \u201crestitution payments,\u201d this court wrote, not the costs of drug treatment. 291 F.3d 363, 365-66 (5th Cir. 2002). In <em>United States v. Vega, </em>332 F.3d 849, 852 n. 3 (5th Cir.2003), this court determined that it was not plain error to allow a probation officer to determine the length of a defendant\u2019s drug treatment.</p>\n<p id=\"b874-18\">In light of our opinions in <em>Warden </em>and <em>Vega, </em>there could be no plain error here because our precedents do not plainly require the result Davis urges. Accordingly, Davis\u2019s sentence is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b874-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
