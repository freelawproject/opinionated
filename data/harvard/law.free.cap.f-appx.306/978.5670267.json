BATCHELDER, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b1002-7\">Defendant Gregory Wayne Conner appeals his conviction and sentence on two counts of bank robbery and one count of use of a firearm in committing a crime of violence. Conner contends that the evidence at trial was insufficient to support his conviction on the firearm charge, and that the district court erred in enhancing his sentence for brandishing a firearm during one of the robberies and in calculating his criminal history. Finding no merit to any of these claims, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-8\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-9\">Over the course of four months in 1996, Conner and his accomplice, Erica Walker, robbed two banks in Kentucky. In each robbery, Conner entered the bank, approached the teller, pulled out a gun, and demanded money. Conner escaped with $29,393 in the first heist, and $2,638 in the second. Each time, Walker drove the getaway car.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-10\">Approximately five minutes after the second robbery, Constable Richard Ban-field saw Conner and Walker\u2019s car, and recognized that it matched the description of the getaway car, which he had just received from dispatch. Banfield called for backup from the Sheriff and followed the car, activating his lights and sirens when the car turned off onto a side road. As Banfield pursued the car, Conner\u2014 according to Walker \u2014 threw an item that resembled a gun out the passenger side window. Banfield stopped the car and approached the driver\u2019s side window; at that point, he observed several one hundred dollar bills in the car. Banfield decided to wait for backup before confronting the occupants of the car further. Shortly thereafter, Kentucky State Police and Sheriffs Department officers arrived, and conducted a search of the car, which yielded the clothing that Conner had worn during the robbery, a Kentucky license plate, and a roll of duct tape. The officers arrested both Walker and Conner.</p>\n<p id=\"b1002-12\">Conner was indicted on charges of bank robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a) (Count One), armed bank robbery in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2113(a &amp; d) (Count Two), and use of a firearm in committing a crime of violence (i.e., the robbery charged in Count Two) in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1) (count Three). He was tried before a jury and convicted on all counts. At sentencing, the district court increased Conner\u2019s offense level by five levels pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(C), because Conner had brandished a firearm during the bank robbery charged in Count One. Although Conner had also brandished a firearm during the bank robbery charged in Count Two, no firearm enhancement was permitted on that count because Conner was convicted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1) for using a firearm during and in relation to that robbery. The district court calculated Conner\u2019s criminal history as Category II. The court imposed one criminal history point for a prior conviction for failing to pay child support; the court imposed two additional points pursuant to USSG \u00a7 4Al.l(d) because Conner committed the bank robberies while he was serving a five-year diversionary sentence for failure' to satisfy child support obligations. Conner timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"981\">*981</page-number>ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-5\">Conner advances three arguments on appeal: that there was insufficient evidence to convict him on Count Three; that the district court erred by enhancing his base offense level on Count One pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(C); and that the district court erred by enhancing his criminal history level by two points pursuant to USSG \u00a7 4Al.l(d). We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-6\">A. Sufficiency of Evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-7\">Conner argues that the evidence presented at trial was not sufficient to prove all elements of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1) beyond a reasonable doubt. In evaluating the sufficiency of the evidence, \u201cwe do not weigh the evidence presented, consider the credibility of the witnesses, or substitute our judgment for that of the jury.\u201d <em>United States v. Gonzalez, </em>512 F.3d 285, 293 (6th Cir.2008). Instead, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution and give the government the benefit of all inferences that could reasonably be drawn from the testimony. <em>Id. </em>We will uphold the judgment so long as <em>\u201cany </em>rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\u201d <em>Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 319, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979) (emphasis in original). This highly deferential standard can be satisfied by circumstantial evidence alone, even when that evidence fails to exclude every reasonable explanation except that of guilt. <em>Gonzalez, </em>512 F.3d at 294.</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-8\">Count Three charged Conner with using a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence \u2014 the armed robbery charged in Count Two \u2014 in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1). The thrust of Conner\u2019s sufficiency-of-the-evidenee argument is that \u00a7 924(c) criminalizes only the use of real firearms, not toys or fakes, and the evidence produced by the government is insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he used a real gun in the robbery. He contends that the government should be required to produce either the weapon itself or expert testimony to prove that the gun he used was real. Alternatively, Conner argues that even if the government is not required to produce the weapon or present expert testimony, the evidence that was produced in this ease was insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the gun he used was not a fake or a toy. In particular, Conner points to the vagueness of much of the testimony on this point, including one witness\u2019s description of the gun as \u201cblack plastic.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b1003-10\">We find no merit in Conner\u2019s arguments. The government is not necessarily required to offer the actual weapon into evidence in order to obtain a conviction under \u00a7 924(c)(1). <em>See United States v. Crowe, </em>291 F.3d 884, 887 (6th Cir.2002) (\u201c[t]he mere possibility that the object seen by witnesses may have been a sophisticated toy or other facsimile does not necessarily create a reasonable doubt, nor is the government required to disprove that theoretical possibility\u201d) (quoting <em>United States v. Jones, </em>16 F.3d 487, 491 (2d Cir.1994)). Here, the government produced the eyewitness testimony of two individuals working at the bank on the day in question, each of whom testified that Conner was holding a black gun. The government corroborated this testimony with video and photographs taken from the bank\u2019s surveillance camera showing Conner holding what appears to be a gun, and with testimony from Conner\u2019s co-defendant that she saw Conner throw an item that \u201clooked like a gun\u201d out the window of her car before they were apprehended by police. While Conner is certainly correct that none of this evidence conclusively proves that he used a <em>real </em>\u2014 as opposed to fake or toy \u2014 gun in the robbery, it is nonetheless sufficient to uphold his convic<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"982\">*982</page-number>tion given the limited scope of our review. <em>Cf. Gonzalez, </em>512 F.3d at 294 (\u201cCircumstantial evidence alone may be sufficient to sustain a conviction and such evidence need not exclude every reasonable explanation except that of guilt.\u201d); <em>see also United States v. Bowlson, </em>148 Fed.Appx. 449, 453 (6th Cir.2005) (eyewitness testimony and bank surveillance pictures were sufficient to support \u00a7 924(c) conviction).</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-4\">B. Enhancement for Brandishing a Firearm.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-5\">We review the district court\u2019s conclusions of law concerning the Sentencing Guidelines de novo and its findings of fact for clear error. <em>United States v. Davidson, </em>409 F.3d 304, 310 (6th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Tocco, </em>306 F.3d 279, 284 (6th Cir.2002). Conner makes a number of-arguments attacking the district court\u2019s decision to increase his base offense level pursuant to USSG \u00a7 2B3.1(b)(2)(C) because he brandished a firearm during the robbery charged in Count One. None of these arguments has any merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-6\">Conner first argues that it was \u201cunfair,\u201d under <em>Booker, </em>for the district court to enhance his sentence based on a fact\u2014 that he brandished a weapon during the first robbery \u2014 not charged in the indictment and found by the jury beyond a reasonable doubt. This argument is clearly unavailing. <em>See Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2465-66, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (\u201cThis Court\u2019s Sixth Amendment cases do not automatically forbid a sentencing court to take account of factual matters not determined by a jury and to increase the sentence in consequence.\u201d); <em>United States v. Ferguson, </em>456 F.3d 660, 665 (6th Cir.2006) (\u201c[T]his court and others have repeatedly held since Booker that district judges can find the facts necessary to calculate the appropriate Guidelines range using the same preponderance-of-the-evidence standard that governed prior to <em>Booker.\u201d).</em></p>\n<p id=\"b1004-8\">Conner also argues that the district court\u2019s application of the brandishing enhancement amounted to impermissible double-counting in light of his conviction on Count Three for carrying a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). But \u201ca brandishing enhancement and \u00a7 924(c) are not cumulative punishment when assessed for separate offenses.\u201d <em>United States v. Griffis, </em>282 F.3d 443, 447 (6th Cir.2002). In this case, the brandishing enhancement was applied solely to Count One while the \u00a7 924(c) charge was based on the conduct charged in Count Two. Therefore, this argument is baseless.</p>\n<p id=\"b1004-9\">Finally, Conner argues that the presentence report erroneously relied on Application Note 4 to USSG \u00a7 2K2.4 to justify application of the brandishing enhancement. That note provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b1004-10\">If a sentence under this guideline is imposed in conjunction with a sentence for an underlying offense, do not apply any specific offense characteristic for possession, brandishing, use, or discharge of an explosive or firearm when determining the sentence for the underlying offense. A sentence under this guideline accounts for any explosive or weapon enhancement for the underlying offense of conviction, including any such enhancement that would apply based on conduct for which the defendant is accountable under \u00a7 1B1.3 (Relevant Conduct). Do not apply any weapon enhancement in the guideline for the underlying offense, for example, if (A) a co-defendant, as part of the jointly undertaken criminal activity, possessed a firearm different from the one for which the defendant was convicted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c); or (B) in an ongoing drug trafficking offense, the defendant possessed a firearm other <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"983\">*983</page-number>than the one for which the defendant was convicted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c). <em>However, if a defendant is convicted of two armed bank robberies, but is convicted under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(c) in connection with only one of the robberies, a weapon enhancement would apply to the bank robbery which was not the basis for the 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(c) conviction.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b1005-5\">(Emphasis added.) The presentence report, responding to Conner\u2019s double-counting objection, relied on the italicized sentence to justify applying the brandishing enhancement in this case. Conner argues that this reliance is misplaced, because the last sentence deals with situations where the defendant is convicted of <em>\u201ctwo </em>armed bank robberies,\u201d and Conner only was convicted of one armed bank robbery and one robbery of a bank by force and violence or by intimidation. But Conner misunderstands \u00a7 2K2.4; that section applies in pertinent part to convictions under \u00a7 924(c), and Application Note 4 merely sets forth the rule that, if a defendant is convicted of an underlying offense (e.g., robbery) and of violating \u00a7 924(c) in relation to the same underlying offense, the sentencing court should \u201cnot apply any specific offense characteristic for possession, brandishing, use, or discharge of an explosive or firearm when determining the sentence for the underlying offense.\u201d Conner\u2019s sentence complies with this rule because the brandishing enhancement was applied only to the robbery charged in Count One, whereas his \u00a7 924(c) conviction related only to the robbery charged in Count Two. Moreover, the italicized portion of Note 4 simply provides an example of this general rule; it does not, as Conner contends, make being convicted of <em>armed </em>robbery a prerequisite to the application of a brandishing enhancement.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-6\">C. Criminal History.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-7\">Conner argues that the district court erred in calculating his criminal history category. Specifically, he argues that the district court should not have assessed two criminal history points pursuant to USSG \u00a7 4A1.1, which provides that a sentencing court should \u201c[a]dd 2 [criminal history] points if the defendant committed the instant offense while under any criminal justice sentence....\u201d USSG \u00a7 4Al.l(d). Conner acknowledges that at the time he committed the robberies, he was in a five-year diversion program for failing to pay child support, but he contends that such a diversion program is not a \u201ccriminal justice sentence,\u201d and therefore should not have triggered the two-point increase called for by \u00a7 4Al.l(d). This is a purely legal question, which we review de novo. <em>Davidson, </em>409 F.3d at 310; <em>Tocco, </em>306 F.3d at 284.</p>\n<p id=\"b1005-8\">Application Note 4 to \u00a7 4A1.1 provides that \u201ca \u2018criminal justice sentence\u2019 means a sentence countable under USSG \u00a7 4A1.2 (Definitions and Instructions for Computing Criminal History) having a custodial or supervisory component, although active supervision is not required for this item to apply.\u201d Section 4A1.2(f) then provides that \u201c[a] diversionary disposition resulting from a finding or admission of guilt, or a plea of nolo contendere, in a judicial proceeding is counted as a sentence under \u00a7 4Al.l(c) even if a conviction is not formally entered----\u201d USSG \u00a7 4A1.2(f). Conner\u2019s diversionary disposition resulted from a guilty plea he entered for flagrant non-support. Thus, under \u00a7 4A1.2(f), Conner\u2019s diversion program is a \u201csentence\u201d for the purpose of \u00a7 4Al.l(c). That the Guidelines section at issue in this case is \u00a7 4Al.l(d), not \u00a7 4Al.l(c), does not inure to Conner\u2019s benefit. Application Note 4 to \u00a7 4A1.1 specifically provides that a \u201ccriminal justice sentence\u201d for purposes of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"984\">*984</page-number>\u00a7 4Al.l(d) includes any \u201csentence countable under \u00a7 4A1.2 ... having a custodial or supervisory component.\u201d ' Conner\u2019s diversionary program is a sentence countable under \u00a7 4A1.2(f), and Conner himself describes that program as requiring \u201cperiodic reviews of child support to determine if the obligor is paying as ordered without having to commence a new case by complaint or indictment.\u201d We are convinced that such a program involves a \u201csupervisory component,\u201d and is therefore properly considered a \u201ccriminal justice sentence\u201d for the purposes of \u00a7 4Al.l(d).</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-4\">Conner also presents a cursory argument that the district court should have exercised discretion and chosen not to apply \u00a7 4Al.l(d), because in light of Conner\u2019s back injury and degenerative disk disease that left him disabled for a significant period of time, it was \u201cunderstandable\u201d that he was not able to remain current with his child support payments. We construe this as an argument that the district court should have granted Conner a downward departure on account of his physical ailments. But Conner has not provided us with any indication that he specifically asked for a downward departure; nor has he provided a transcript of the sentencing hearing. We will not review a district court\u2019s failure to grant a downward departure unless the record reflects that the court was unaware of or did not understand its discretionary authority to make such a departure. <em>United States v. Puckett, </em>422 F.3d 340, 345 (6th Cir.2005). Here we have no record to review.</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-5\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b1006-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
