Hernandez alleges that prior to the parties signing the contract, Ikon represented that it would \u201cservice and support your solution to ensure it continues to function at optimal capacity and meet the demands of your daily workflow.\u201d According to Hernandez, a few years into the contract, Ikon\u2019s poor service caused him to have to hire and pay outside vendors for maintenance of the copiers.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-19\">Hernandez sued Ikon alleging violations of the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices\u2014 Consumer Protection Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On Ikon\u2019s motion, the district court dismissed the suit with prejudice and denied Hernandez leave to amend. Hernandez appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b203-20\">We review the district court\u2019s dismissal pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) de novo.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Hernandez\u2019s complaint alleges that Ikon contracted to service Hernandez\u2019s copiers <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"182\">*182</page-number>to meet the demands of his work flow, but that Ikon did not provide services at this level. The district court dismissed the suit because these allegations amounted to a breach of contract claim, not the DTPA claim. We agree. The Texas Supreme Court has made clear that \u201c[a]n allegation of a mere breach of contract, without more, does not constitute a \u2018false, misleading or deceptive act\u2019 in violation of the DTPA.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Hernandez points to Texas law allowing DTPA claims alongside contract claims when the defendant makes an initial misrepresentation that was known at the time of the transaction and made to induce the consumer into the transaction.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> But Hernandez\u2019s complaint is devoid of any allegation that Ikon never intended to perform on the contract. Significantly, the complaint also affirmatively alleged that Ikon initially performed under the contract. The district court did not err in concluding that the high standard for dismissal set by Rule 12(b)(6) was met; we AFFIRM the dismissal of the DTPA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b204-4\">However, we find that the district court abused its discretion in denying Hernandez leave to amend, better described as discretion with a strong bias in favor of granting leave to amend.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The district court\u2019s rationale for denying leave \u2014 that \u201camendment would be futile\u201d \u2014 is incorrect because the allegations in Hernandez\u2019s complaint clearly add up to a breach of contract claim and the very basis for Ikon\u2019s Rule 12(b)(6) motion was that it was a breach of contract case. While Hernandez could have included a breach of contract cause of action in his initial complaint, he was entitled to proceed as he did with his DTPA claim.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> At the motion to dismiss stage of the proceedings, with a claim conceded to be viable, he should have been given at least one chance to amend. Ikon has no claim of prejudice; the original complaint gave it adequate notice of the transactions at issue. The Supreme Court\u2019s direction, given in a case in which it permitted an amendment that changed the theory of the case from enforcement of an oral contract to quantum meruit, is that \u201cleave to amend \u2018shall be freely given when justice so requires.\u2019 \u201d<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> Accordingly, we AFFIRM dismissal of the DTPA claim, REVERSE the denial of leave to amend, and REMAND to the district court.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b203-12\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
