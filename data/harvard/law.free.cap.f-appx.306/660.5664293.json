KEENAN,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> District Judge.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"7\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b683-12\"> The Honorable John F. Keenan, District Judge for the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"8\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b683-18\">\n<em>SUMMARY ORDER</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b683-19\">Samuel Sommer appeals from the judgment of the district court granting the defendants\u2019 motions to dismiss Sommer\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 complaint. The defendants-appellees assert that the district court\u2019s judgment should be affirmed. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts, proceedings below, and specification of issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b683-20\">This Court reviews <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s dismissal of a complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), construing the complaint liberally, accepting all factual allegations in the complaint as true, and drawing all reasonable inferences in the plaintiffs favor. <em>See Chambers v. Time Warner, Inc., </em>282 F.3d 147, 152 (2d Cir. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"662\">*662</page-number>2002); <em>see also Miller v. Wolpoff &amp; Abramson, L.L.P., </em>321 F.3d 292, 300 (2d Cir.2003). Even construing Sommer\u2019s complaint liberally and accepting its factual allegations as true, an independent review shows that the district court properly dismissed Sommer\u2019s complaint because (1) qualified immunity shielded defendant-appellee DiVincenzo from suit, (2) Sommer failed to allege personal involvement on the pai\u2019t of defendant-appellee Spotta, (3) as to defendant-appellee County of Suffolk, Sommer failed to allege that any allegedly unconstitutional actions were part of a municipality-wide practice or custom; and (4) Judge Crecca was shielded from suit by the doctrine of absolute immunity. Moreover, as Judge Crecca argues on appeal, Sommer\u2019s suit against Judge Crecca in his official capacity is barred by the Eleventh Amendment. <em>See Kimel v. Florida Bd. of Regents, </em>528 U.S. 62, 73, 120 S.Ct. 631, 145 L.Ed.2d 522 (2000); <em>Ying Jing Gan v. City of N.Y., </em>996 F.2d 522, 529 (2d Cir.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b684-4\">As the district court observed, much litigation would have been obviated if Suffolk County had given appellant the autopsy report he seeks. We are not ordering, but suggesting, that the County do so.</p>\n<p id=\"b684-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is hereby AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
