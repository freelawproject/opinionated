In a case involving 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), we review a district court\u2019s conclusions about the scope of its legal authority <em>de novo. United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1326 (11th Cir.2008)(citing <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"470\">*470</page-number><em>(per </em>curiam)). Section 3582(c)(2) authorizes a district court to reduce the sentence \u201cof a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission ...\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Amendment 706 to the Sentencing Guidelines reduced the base offense level for some crack cocaine offenses by two levels. <em>See </em>U.S. SENTENCING GUIDELINES MANUAL App. C, amend. 706 (2007). Amendment 713 made Amendment 706 retroactive effective March 3, 2008. <em>See </em>U.S. SENTENCING GUIDELINES MANUAL App. C, amend. 713 (Supp. May 1, 2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-4\">Section 3582(c)(2) also requires that any sentence reduction be \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\u201d Section lB1.10(a)(2)(B) of the Sentencing Guidelines states that a sentence reduction is not authorized if the relevant amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d The application note for this section provides that an amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s guideline range if the defendant was originally sentenced to a statutory minimum term of imprisonment. U.S. SENTENCING GUIDELINES MANUAL \u00a7 1B1.10, cmt. n. 1(A) (Supp. May 1, 2008). The-Supreme Court has also held that district courts remain \u201cconstrained by the mandatory m\u00ednimums\u201d in 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841. <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 558, 574, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-6\">Henry was originally sentenced to a statutory mandatory minimum sentence of 120 months in prison. Therefore, the district court did not err in ruling that Henry\u2019s guideline range was not reduced and that he was not eligible for relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-7\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-8\">Henry next argues, for the first time on appeal, that treating prisoners who, like himself, received a mandatory minimum sentence differently from those who do not, by declaring only the latter eligible for \u00a7 3582(c)(2) relief, violates the equal protection component of the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. Arguments raised for the first time on appeal are reviewed for plain error. <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b492-9\">A \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding does not constitute \u201ca full <em>de novo </em>resentencing.\u201d <em>United States v. Cothran, </em>106 F.3d 1560, 1562 (11th Cir.1997). We have previously held that constitutional claims are \u201cextraneous resentencing issues\u201d that a court cannot address in a context of a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding. <em>United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 782 (11th Cir.2000). Because a district court may not consider constitutional issues during a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, the district court did not plainly err by not considering, <em>sua sponte, </em>Henry\u2019s equal protection challenge. A defendant is entitled to raise constitutional challenges to a sentence by making a collateral attack under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b492-10\">Finding no reversible error with regard to Henry\u2019s sentence, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b492-11\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
