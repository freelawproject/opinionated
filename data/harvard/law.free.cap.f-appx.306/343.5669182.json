After determining that Priday was subject to an enhanced sentence under section 924(e)(1) as an armed career criminal, because he had three prior convictions for violent felonies, <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B 1.4(a), the district court sentenced him to 180 months in prison and 3 years of supervised release. On appeal, Priday argues that the district court violated the Sixth Amendment and acted contrary to <em>Apprendi v. New Jersey, </em>530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), when it concluded that his conviction for tampering with a motor vehicle was a violent felony.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-13\">We recently held the Missouri crime of tampering does not qualify as a \u201ccrime of violence\u201d for purposes of U.S. Sentencing Guideline \u00a7 2K2.1(a)(2), <em>United States v. Williams, </em>537 F.3d 969, 974-75 (8th Cir. 2008), a term we recognize as synonymous with the term \u201cviolent felony\u201d for purposes of the Armed Career Criminal Act, <em>see United States v. Johnson, </em>417 F.3d 990, 996 (8th Cir.2005) (\u201cThe statutory definition of \u2018violent felony\u2019 is viewed as interchangeable with the guidelines definition of \u2018crime of violence.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b366-15\">Based on the holding in <em>Williams, </em>we reverse the sentence and remand to the district court for resentencing.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
