(\u201cRODCO\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s summary judgment in RODCO\u2019s declaratory judgment action seeking a determination of the coverage obligations of Defendant-Appellee Arch Specialty Insurance Co. (\u201cArch\u201d) under a professional liability insurance policy issued to RODCO. Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b134-17\">I. Facts and Proceedings</p>\n<p id=\"b134-18\">In June 2004, RODCO and AXIS Surplus Insurance Co. (\u201cAxis\u201d) entered a Binding Authority Agreement, under which RODCO agreed to serve as an insurance agent and broker for Axis. Section 5.4 of the agreement provides in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b134-19\">[RODCO] will not accept proposals for insurance, underwrite, rate, quote, issue, deliver, and service binders, certificates, policies, or contracts of insurance and endorsements on ... risks which are unacceptable in accordance with this agreement or do not conform to the standards and guidelines set forth in the Schedule and Underwriting Guidelines or are in excess of the authority limits or in violation of any other limitations set out in the Schedule and Underwriting Guidelines....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b134-20\">Among other restrictions, the agreement and incorporated underwriting guidelines prohibited RODCO from issuing policies covering (a) property located anywhere other than Louisiana, or (b) greenhouses. RODCO nonetheless issued three Axis insurance policies for property located in Mississippi and one policy for property in Louisiana that included five greenhouses. After receiving notice of the three policies covering property located in Mississippi, Axis notified RODCO of its error in issuing those policies. RODCO canceled two of the policies but failed to cancel the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"113\">*113</page-number>third. Axis also received notice of the policy covering the property in Louisiana that covered greenhouses, but it did not immediately recognize the error.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-5\">Hurricane Katrina damaged the properties insured by the two erroneously issued policies that remained in force in August 2005. The owner of the policy insuring the Louisiana greenhouses submitted a claim to Axis for $618,442; the owner of the other policy, the Sweet Bay Condo Association of Pass Christian, Mississippi, submitted a claim for $687,587. Axis paid both claims and then sought to recover the amounts paid from RODCO, asserting that RODCO had \u201cbreached the terms of the [Binding Authority] Agreement and/or negligently placed the risk[s] outside the scope of its authority.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b135-6\">RODCO submitted Axis\u2019s claims to Arch for payment under a \u201cProslip Agents and Brokers Professional Liability Insurance Policy\u201d that Arch had issued to RODCO. Under the terms of the policy, Arch agreed to pay claims resulting from ROD-CO\u2019s negligence in \u201crendering or failing to render professional services\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-7\">We will pay on behalf of the insured damages which the insured becomes legally obligated to pay because of a claim first made against the insured for a negligent act, error or omission committed by the insured in the rendering or failing to render professional services ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-8\">(Emphasis in original). The policy defined \u201cprofessional services\u201d as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"APo\">Professional services means the operation, management and work performed by you or on your behalf in the conduct of the business named in the Declarations:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-9\">a. As a duly licensed:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-10\">(1) Insurance agent</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-11\">(2) Insurance broker</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-12\">(3) Insurance solicitor;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-13\">(4) Surplus line or excess line's broker;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-14\">(5) Reinsurance intermediary;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-15\">(6) General insurance agent; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-16\">(7) Managing general agent;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-17\">b. and when engaged in the following insurance related activities:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-18\">* * <em>*</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-19\">(6) Placement and sales of insurance products....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-21\">(Emphasis in original). The policy also, however, contained two exclusions relating to contractual liability, among others:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-22\">The insurance does not apply to any claim based upon, arising out of, or in any way involving:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-23\">* <em>* </em>*</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-24\">1. Any contractual liability.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-25\">* * *</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-26\">q. Any actual or alleged breach of any contract, warranty, guarantee, or promise unless liability would have attached to the insured even in the absence of such contract, warranty, guarantee, or promise____</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b135-28\">(Emphasis in original). Relying on these exclusions, Arch rejected RODCO\u2019s claims, asserting that they arose from RODCO\u2019s breach of the Binding Authority Agreement between RODCO and Axis.</p>\n<p id=\"b135-29\">RODCO filed a declaratory judgment action against Arch seeking a determination that its professional liability insurance policy covered Axis\u2019s claims. The parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, and the district court ruled in favor of Arch, finding that the terms of the policy excluded coverage for Axis\u2019s claims against RODCO:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b135-30\">The contractual liability exclusion located at subpart (q) of Arch\u2019s policy is broadly worded to exclude coverage for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"114\">*114</page-number>a claim \u201cbased on, arising out of, or in any way involving\u201d a breach of contract. AXIS\u2019s claim against RODCO unarguably arises out of or involves a breach of contract. RODCO became liable to AXIS solely because the contract that governed their business relationship expressly precluded the very actions that RODCO took. But for the terms of the Binding Authority Agreement, ROD-CO\u2019s actions would not have been negligent or in error. RODCO\u2019s acts were not negligent or erroneous in the abstract because if the Binding Authority Agreement had allowed RODCO to place the two policies then no party would have incurred damages as a result of RODCO\u2019s conduct.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b136-4\">RODCO filed a motion for new trial, which is \u201cproperly considered a ... Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e) motion for reconsideration.\u201d <em>Little v. Keirsey, </em>No. 94-50931,1995 WL 625429, at *1 n. 2 (5th Cir. Oct. 6, 1995). The court denied the motion \u201cfor the reasons previously assigned\u201d in its order granting Arch\u2019s motion for summary judgment. RODCO timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-5\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n<p id=\"b136-6\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s grant of summary judgment. <em>Hall v. Gillman Inc., </em>81 F.3d 35, 36 (5th Cir.1996) (citing <em>Neff v. Am. Dairy Queen Corp., </em>58 F.3d 1063, 1065 (5th Cir.1996)). Summary judgment is proper when \u201cthe pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-7\">III. Discussion</p>\n<p id=\"b136-8\">Although \u201cany doubt or ambiguity as to the meaning of a provision in an insurance policy\u201d must be resolved in favor of the insured, <em>Borden, Inc. v. Howard Trucking Co., </em>454 So.2d 1081, 1086 (La.1983), insurance policies are \u201csubject to the general rules of contract interpretation.\u201d <em>Broadmoor Anderson v. Nat\u2019l Union Fire Ins. Co., </em>912 So.2d 400, 404 (La.Ct.App. 2005). Thus, \u201c[t]he judicial responsibility in interpreting insurance contracts is to determine the parties\u2019 common intent ... as reflected by the words in the policy.\u201d <em>Louisiana Ins. Guar. Ass\u2019n v. Interstate Fire &amp; Cas. Co., </em>630 So.2d 759, 763 (La. 1994). Consistent with this responsibility, the district court in the present ease found that the \u201ccontractual liability exclusion located at subpart (q) of Arch\u2019s policy\u201d means what it says: the policy does not cover claims \u201cbased upon, arising out of, or in any way involving\u201d a breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b136-10\">Framing its first issue on appeal as \u201c[wjhether the contractual liability applies absent an assumption by RODCO of the liability of a third party,\u201d RODCO argues that \u201cthe \u2018contractual liability\u2019 exclusion is inapplicable and does not bar coverage under the Arch professional liability policy.\u201d In support of this argument, RODCO cites <em>Broadmoor Anderson v. National Union Fire Insurance Co. </em>for the proposition that under a \u201creasonable interpretation,\u201d contract liability exclusions apply only to a \u201cspecific assumption by the insured of liability that solely results irom the negligence or contractual breach of a third party.\u201d 912 So.2d at 407. Likewise, RODCO relies on <em>Estate of Patout v. City of New Iberia, </em>in which the court explained that the purpose of an exclusion at issue in that case was to \u201celiminate the insurer\u2019s liability when the insured has assumed liability.\u201d 849 So.2d 535, 541 n. 2 (La.Ct.App.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b136-11\">From these authorities, RODCO concludes that because it \u201cdid not assume liability in the Binding Authority Agreement for the errors RODCO made in plac<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"115\">*115</page-number>ing the [insurance policies at issue] that it would not otherwise have had for its own negligence, the contract exclusion liability is inapplicable.\u201d <em>Broadmoor </em>and <em>Patout, </em>however, provide no support for this conclusion. The contractual liability exclusion at issue in <em>Broadmoor </em>stated that \u201cwhen \u2018the insured is obligated to pay damages by reason of the assumption of liability in a contract,\u2019 coverage is excluded under the policy.\u201d 912 So.2d at 406. Similarly, the exclusion discussed in <em>Patout </em>provided that \u201c[t]his policy does not apply ... to liability assumed by the Insured under any contract or agreement except an incidental contract.\u201d 849 So.2d at 541. The meaning of these and similar \u201cassumed liability\u201d provisions has no bearing on the proper interpretation of the far broader exclusion provision in the policy Arch issued to RODCO.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-5\">RODCO also argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment for Arch because \u201cRODCO\u2019s actions give rise to an action in contract and in tort and therefore survive the \u2018breach of contract\u2019 exception.\u201d RODCO\u2019s framing of the issue\u2014\u201c[w]hether a negligent act by RODCO ... which may also constitute a breach of contract, gives rise to an action in tort\u201d\u2014misses the mark. The relevant question is not whether RODCO\u2019s actions give rise to tort claims in addition to claims for breach of contract, though its action may support tort claims given the \u201clong-standing rule that \u2018when a party has been damaged by the conduct of another arising out a contractual relationship, the former may have two remedies, a suit in contract, or an action in tort.\u2019 \u201d <em>Corbello v. Iowa Prod., </em>850 So.2d 686, 708 (La.2003) (quoting <em>Fed. Ins. Co. v. Ins. Co. of N. Am., </em>262 La. 509, 263 So.2d 871, 872 (1972)). Instead, the relevant question is whether RODCO\u2019s insurance policy excludes coverage for claims \u201cbased upon, arising out of, or in any way involving\u201d RODCO\u2019s breach of the Binding Authority Agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b137-7\"><em>Cute\u2019-Togs of New Orleans, Inc. v. Louisiana Health Service &amp; Indemnity Co., </em>386 So.2d 87 (La.1980), a case neither party cites, compels the conclusion that RODCO\u2019s policy does exclude coverage for such claims. In that case, Blue Cross agreed to insure Cute\u2019-Togs\u2019 subscribing employees under a group health insurance policy. <em>Id. </em>at 88. One of the company\u2019s employees quit after he discovered upon his wife\u2019s admission to the hospital that Blue Cross had failed to process his application for insurance under the policy. <em>Id. </em>Cute\u2019Togs sued Blue Cross, alleging that its negligence in failing to process the application caused a loss of production resulting from the employee\u2019s departure. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b137-8\">Blue Cross filed a third-party demand against its liability insurer, Aetna, asserting that Aetna had a duty to defend the suit. <em>Id. </em>Aetna moved successfully for summary judgment in the trial court on the ground that Blue Cross\u2019s policy provided no coverage for Cute\u2019-Togs\u2019 claim. <em>Id. </em>The court of appeals reversed, finding that \u201cassuming all of the allegations of fact in Cute\u2019-Togs\u2019 petition [were] true, negligent acts constituting an occurrence did take place and damage to property resulted, and that on the occurrence of these two events, Aetna had a duty to defend.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b137-9\">The Louisiana Supreme Court reversed, holding that the following exclusion in Blue Cross\u2019s policy with Aetna barred its claim: \u201cThis insurance does not apply ... to loss of use of tangible property which has not been physically injured or destroyed resulting from ... a delay in or lack of performance of the named insured of any contract or agreement....\u201d <em>Id. </em>In support of its holding, the supreme court explicitly rejected the lower court\u2019s reasoning that Aetna had a duty to defend Blue Cross <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"116\">*116</page-number>because the policy did not \u201cspecifically exclude negligence as a contractual ground of non-defense\u201d:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b138-4\">This reasoning overlooks the source of Cute\u2019-Togs\u2019 alleged damages. According to the allegations of plaintiffs petition, the duty/right relationship between the parties arose out of the insurance agreement between them, and the allegations of plaintiffs petition allege no more than a negligent failure of that duty.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b138-5\"><em>Id. </em>at 89. Because Cute\u2019-Togs\u2019 petition alleged \u201cno more than a negligent failure of that duty,\u201d the supreme court held, the unambiguous exclusion relied upon by Aetna was applicable. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b138-6\">The same is true here. As RODCO explains in its own brief, the \u201c[Binding Authority Agreement] established the agency relationship [between RODCO and Axis] and outlined the duties and limitations of the agency authority created by said agreement. AXIS\u2019[s] claims arise out of the alleged negligent manner in which the agency duties were performed by RODCO.\u201d <em>Cute\u2019-Togs </em>forecloses any argument that RODCO\u2019s policy provides coverage for such claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b138-7\">Finally, RODCO argues that we should reject the district court\u2019s interpretation of the insurance policy because it \u201cproduces absurd results as it would cause the operation of an exclusion to hinge upon the identity of the person asserting the professional liability claims against the insured.\u201d This argument is without merit. As the district court noted in its order, the contractual liability exclusion thwarting ROD-CO\u2014like all policy exclusions\u2014creates a \u201cpotential gap,\u201d but it leaves intact substantial coverage for \u201cnegligence ... in the rendering or failure to render professional services.\u201d The district court correctly determined that this is not a result \u201cso absurd as to allow the Court to rewrite a policy that is not ambiguous on its face.\u201d <em>See Succession of Fannaly v. Lafayette Ins. Co., </em>805 So.2d 1134, 1137 (La.2002) (\u201cWhen the words of an insurance contract are clear and explicit and lead to no absurd consequences, courts must enforce the contract as written.\u201d)</p>\n<p id=\"b138-9\">IV. Conclusion</p>\n<p id=\"b138-10\">For the reasons set forth above, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment to Arch, or in denying RODCO\u2019s motion for new trial. We therefore AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b134-15\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
