He also moves for oral argument on appeal and for the exclusion of evidence introduced in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b45-29\">Rollins argues on appeal that the evidence does not support the magistrate judge\u2019s determination, which the district court adopted, that Rollins\u2019s excessive <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"24\">*24</page-number>force claims against Officers Keith Bickham, Johnny Gerald, and Rick Warren were not supported by a preponderance of the evidence. However, Rollins has not demonstrated that the magistrate judge\u2019s factual and credibility determinations concerning these claims constituted clear error. <em>See Baldwin v. Stalder, </em>137 F.3d 836, 839 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-4\">Rollins does not challenge the district court\u2019s dismissal of his claims against the Washington Correctional Institute, Officer Robert Tanner, and Officer Wayne Kennedy for failure to exhaust administrative remedies or, in the case of Officer Kennedy, as barred by <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). Accordingly, he has abandoned these claims. <em>See Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b46-5\">AFFIRMED; ALL PENDING MOTIONS DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b45-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
