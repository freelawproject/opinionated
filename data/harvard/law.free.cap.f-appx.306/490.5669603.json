During a state-wide budget crisis in 2008, she was laid off. Nancy L. Worley was the appointing authority within the Secretary of State\u2019s office, and the person who informed Jenkins that she was laid off. In July 2005, Jenkins petitioned the State Personnel Board (\u201cthe Board\u201d) for a hearing regarding the propriety of the lay-off and whether Worley had impermissibly hired another employee to fill Jenkins\u2019s position after Jenkins was laid off. The Board responded both that Jenkins\u2019s petition was untimely and that the Board had conducted a review of its records and could find no factual support for Jenkins\u2019s claims.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-17\">In October 2005, Jenkins filed a lawsuit in the Montgomery County Circuit Court, alleging that Worley and the other Defendants, all members of the Board, had violated Alabama\u2019s Merit System Act and deprived Jenkins of her property interest in her job, in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. The Defendants removed the case to federal court. (R.l-1.) The magistrate judge denied Jenkins\u2019s motion for remand to state court and later granted Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment on all of Jenkins\u2019s claims.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Jenkins appeals, arguing that the federal court lacked subject matter jurisdiction and that genuine issues of material fact made summary judgment inappropriate.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-18\">First, we consider the jurisdictional issue. After review of the pleadings, we conclude that the federal court had jurisdiction. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1441(b), an action that \u201caris[es] under the Constitution, treaties or laws of the United States\u201d is generally removable. Each and every count of Jenkins\u2019s complaint alleges a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. Jenkins\u2019s argument that these claims are peripheral to her state claims is insufficient to deprive the federal courts of subject matter jurisdiction. Removal was proper.</p>\n<p id=\"b513-19\">On the merits, we find that summary judgment for the Defendants also was proper for the reasons stated in the magistrate judge\u2019s Memorandum Opinion and Order. (R.3-50 at 11-13.)</p>\n<p id=\"b514-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"492\">*492</page-number>For the foregoing reasons, summary judgment for the Defendants is affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b514-4\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b513-15\">. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(c)(1), the parties consented to entry of final judgment by the magistrate judge.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
