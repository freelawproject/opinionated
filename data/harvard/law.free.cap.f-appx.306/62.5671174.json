(\u201cWilson\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s Order Granting Appellee Notre Dame Investors, Inc.\u2019s Motion to Dismiss Appeal from Order Denying Relief from Automatic Stay Pending Arbitration and Denying Wilson Refining, L.P.\u2019s Motion to Disqualify. In the motion for relief from automatic stay, which was denied by the bankruptcy court, Wilson sought relief from the stay so that it could liquidate its claim against Notre Dame Investors, Inc. (\u201cNDI\u201d) in arbitration. In case number 08-50132, Wilson appeals the bankruptcy court\u2019s order denying its application for post-petition attorneys\u2019 fees, which was affirmed by the district court. For the reasons stated below, we affirm the orders in both cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-25\">On August 10, 2006, the bankruptcy court confirmed the plan of reorganization <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"64\">*64</page-number>in NDI\u2019s Chapter 11 case. Wilson did not appeal the bankruptcy court\u2019s confirmation order. Article 2.04 of the confirmed plan, which defines Class Four to include general unsecured claims, states: \u201cThis class of creditors specifically includes the Allowed Claims of Wilson Refining, as finally approved by the court.\u201d Pursuant to Article 12.01 of the plan, the bankruptcy court retained jurisdiction to \u201cclassify, allow or disallow Claims under the Plan and to hear and determine any controversies pertaining thereto\u201d and \u201cto liquidate or estimate damages in connection with any contingent or unliquidated claim.\u201d <footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Article 13.02 of the plan states, in relevant part, that \u201cthe consideration distributed under the Plan shall be in complete satisfaction, release and discharge of the Debtor and its assets from all claims of any creditor or interest holder, including claims arising prior to the Effective Date.\u201d On October 16, 2006, the bankruptcy court held a hearing on NDI\u2019s objection to Wilson\u2019s claim and valued Wilson\u2019s claim in the amount of $2 million, plus interest and fees.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> NDI has paid, and Wilson has accepted, the full value of this allowed claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-4\">The district court dismissed Wilson\u2019s appeal as equitably moot, finding that the plan had been substantially consummated and that granting Wilson\u2019s requested relief would affect third-party rights under the plan. We agree that this appeal should be dismissed, but we reach this conclusion based on res judicata principles, not equitable mootness.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">Res judicata requires the following four elements: (1) the parties must be identical in the two actions; (2) the prior judgment must have been rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction; (3) there must be a final judgment on the merits; and (4) the same cause of action must be involved in both cases. <em>Eubanks v. Fed. Deposit Ins. Corp., </em>977 F.2d 166, 169 (5th Cir.1992). A bankruptcy court\u2019s confirmation order is a final judgment for purposes of res judicata. <em>Republic Supply Co. v. Shoaf, </em>815 F.2d 1046, 1054 (5th Cir.1987). The confirmed plan itself is final and binding against all creditors pursuant to 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 1141(a) and (d). <em>See also Eubanks, </em>977 F.2d at 170-71.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-9\">Here, all of the elements of res judicata are satisfied: (1) Wilson and NDI were both parties before the bankruptcy court at the confirmation hearing and the hearing on the objection to the claim; (2) Wilson does not argue that the bankruptcy court was incompetent to value its claim, only that it was an abuse of discretion for the court to refuse to send the issue to arbitration; (3) the plan and confirmation order are final judgments discharging Wilson\u2019s claim after it accepted the distribution payment; and (4) all the issues raised by Wilson on appeal relate to the discharged claim against NDI and could have been raised at the confirmation hearing or at the hearing on the objection to the claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>Wilson wants to accept the $2 million distribution payment under the plan while continuing to pursue further recovery on the same claim. The plan, which is given the effect of a final judgment, provides that \u201cthe consideration distributed under the Plan shall be in complete satisfaction, release and discharge of the Debtor and its assets from all claims of any creditor or interest holder, including claims arising prior to the Effective Date.\u201d Thus, after Wilson accepted its $2 million distribution pursuant to the plan, its claim against NDI was discharged and it cannot continue to pursue further recovery on that claim in arbitration.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-5\">In case number 08-50132, Wilson appeals the bankruptcy court\u2019s denial of its application for post-petition attorneys\u2019 fees. Section 14.02 of the plan states that \u201c[n]o attorneys\u2019 fees will be paid with respect to any Claim ... except as specified herein or as allowed by a prior order of the Court.\u201d For the reasons articulated above, we find that the plan, combined with Wilson\u2019s acceptance of the distribution payment including the portion representing pre-petition attorneys\u2019 fees, is res judicata as to the issue of whether NDI may recover post-petition attorneys\u2019 fees.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b87-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s dismissal of Wilson\u2019s appeal from the bankruptcy court\u2019s order denying relief from the stay (case number 07-51164) and we AFFIRM the bankruptcy court\u2019s order denying Wilson\u2019s application for post-petition attorneys\u2019 fees (case number 08-50132).</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b85-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b86-5\">. Similar language appears in the confirmation order, which states that the bankruptcy court retains jurisdiction \u201cto classify, allow or disallow Claims and direct distribution of funds under the Amended Plan, and to hear and determine any controversies pertaining thereto.\u201d</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b86-6\">. Subsequently, Wilson applied for attorneys\u2019 fees as part of this allowed claim. The bankruptcy court approved the pre-petition attorneys\u2019 fees but disallowed the post-petition attorneys\u2019 fees. This decision was separately appealed in case number 08-50132.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b86-11\">. Although the district court did not rule on the issue of res judicata, it was raised by NDI in the context of its equitable mootness argument in both its motion to dismiss and its accompanying brief. Wilson addressed the issue in its response to the motion to dismiss.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b87-8\">. Wilson also appealed the district court\u2019s denial of its Motion to Disqualify counsel for NDI on the basis that such counsel was also acting as appellate counsel for a creditor. Because it dismissed the appeal relating to that creditor, the district court, in the same order, denied Wilson\u2019s motion to disqualify counsel as moot. We see no error.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
