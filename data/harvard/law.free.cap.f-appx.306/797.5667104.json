He was sentenced to 121 months of incarceration. The issue he has raised before us is whether the District Court erred when it added a two-level enhancement to his sentencing calculation because two firearms were found in the Appellant\u2019s residence. The District Court had jurisdiction over Sanchez\u2019 case pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"798\">*798</page-number>and we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291 and 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3742(a). We have subject matter jurisdiction over Sanchez\u2019 appeal, even though he agreed to an appellate waiver in his plea agreement. <em>United States v. Gwinnett, </em>483 F.3d 200, 203 (3d Cir.2007). However, we may refuse to exercise that jurisdiction upon a finding that the appellate waiver is valid. <em>Id. </em>We make a <em>de novo </em>determination as to the validity of Sanchez\u2019 appellate waiver. <em>United States v. Jackson, </em>523 F.3d 234, 237 (3d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b820-4\">We will dismiss the appeal because the record conclusively demonstrates that Appellant knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to appeal his sentence. We enforce an appeal waiver if such a waiver is entered knowingly and voluntarily, unless enforcement of the waiver would work a miscarriage of justice. The District Court complied with Fed.R.Crim.P. ll(b)(l)(N), which required it to \u201cinform the defendant of, and determine that the defendant understands [ ... ] the terms of any provision in a plea agreement waiving the right to appeal.\u201d As the District Court complied with the Rules of Criminal Procedure, and the Appellant has alleged no miscarriage of justice, we will dismiss the appeal.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
