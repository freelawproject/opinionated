We have jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. Reviewing for substantial evidence, <em>Pal v. INS, </em>204 F.3d 935, 937 n. 2 (9th Cir.2000), we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">Substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s adverse credibility finding that rested on material inconsistencies that went to the heart of Akcheirlian\u2019s asylum claim. <em>See id. </em>at 938; <em>see also Li v. Ashcroft, </em>378 F.3d 959, 964 (9th Cir.2004) (upholding adverse credibility finding where at least one of the IJ\u2019s identified grounds was supported by substantial evidence and went to the heart of petitioner\u2019s claim of persecution). Accordingly, Akcheirlian failed to establish eligibility for asylum.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">Because Akcheirlian failed to establish eligibility for asylum, she necessarily failed to meet the more stringent standard for withholding of removal. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153, 1156 (9th Cir. 2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">Because Akcheirlian\u2019s CAT claim is based on the same evidence that the IJ found not credible, and Akcheirlian points to no other evidence that the IJ should have considered, her CAT claim also fails. <em>See id. </em>at 1157.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-8\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b388-27\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
