He claims the district court erred in denying his motion to suppress his confession, contending that his signed waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights was not made intelligently or voluntarily because he had no food and little water for several days prior to signing the waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-7\">\u201c [Statements made by a defendant during custodial interrogation may not be used against him at trial unless procedural safeguards are employed to protect the defendant\u2019s Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination\u201d. <em>United States v. Andrews, </em>22 F.3d 1328, 1337 (5th Cir. 1994). Custodial interrogation may be used to elicit a confession where a suspect has validly waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights. <em>United States v. Cardenas, </em>410 F.3d 287, 292 (5th Cir.2005). The Government bears the burden of showing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that Baltazar\u2019s <em>Miranda </em>waiver was valid. <em>See United States v. Garcia Abrego, </em>141 F.3d 142,171 (5th Cir.1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-8\">\u201cA defendant\u2019s waiver of his <em>Miranda </em>rights is only effective if the waiver is knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily made.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The inquiry whether a waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights is valid contains two distinct dimensions: \u201cthe relinquishment of the right must have been voluntary in the sense that it was the product of a free and deliberate choice rather than intimidation, coercion, or deception\u201d; and \u201cthe waiver must have been made with a full awareness of both the nature of the right being abandoned and the consequences of the decision to abandon it\u201d. <em>Cardenas, </em>410 F.3d at 293 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-13\">A district court\u2019s determination regarding the validity of a <em>Miranda </em>waiver is a question of law that is reviewed <em>de novo, </em>but the factual findings underlying the district court\u2019s legal determination are reviewed only for clear error. <em>E.g., Garcia Abrego, </em>141 F.3d at 171. \u201cWhere a district court\u2019s denial of a suppression motion is based on live oral testimony, the clearly erroneous standard is particularly strong because the judge had the opportunity to observe the demeanor of the witnesses.\u201d <em>United States v. Santiago, </em>410 F.3d 193, 197 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b864-14\">The district court did not err, following a pretrial suppression hearing, in finding that Baltazar was not subjected to coercive conduct by Border Patrol Agents, and that he knowingly and intelligently waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights. <em>See Cardenas, </em>410 F.3d at 293; <em>Garcia Abrego, </em>141 F.3d at 171-72; <em>Andrews, </em>22 F.3d at 1340. Therefore, the district court did not err in denying Baltazar\u2019s motion to suppress the confession. <em>See Cardenas, </em>410 F.3d at 297. Accordingly, Baltazar\u2019s confession was admissible at trial because he knowingly, intelligently, and voluntarily waived his <em>Miranda </em>rights before giving his confession.</p>\n<p id=\"b864-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b864-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
