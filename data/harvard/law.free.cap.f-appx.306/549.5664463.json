Ball, a federal prisoner convicted of crack-cocaine offenses, appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his <em>pro se </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for a reduced sentence. On appeal, Ball argues that the district court denied his \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion under the erroneous belief that it had no authority to depart from the restrictions set forth by \u00a7 3582(c)(2) and the Sentencing Guidelines. He maintains that the limitations of U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10 conflict with the holding of <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), and that the district court\u2019s adherence to \u00a7 1B1.10 resulted in an unconstitutional mandatory application of the Guidelines. Further, he notes that the district court departed from his original sentence pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 35.</p>\n<p id=\"b572-15\">We review \u201ca district court\u2019s decision whether to reduce a sentence pursuant to [\u00a7 3582(c)(2) ], based on a subsequent change in the sentencing guidelines, for abuse of discretion.\u201d <em>United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir. 2003). However, in the \u00a7 3582(c)(2) context, we review <em>\u201cde novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264,1267 (11th Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b572-16\">A district court may not modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed except where expressly permitted by statute or by Fed.R.Crim.P. 35. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(1)(B). One statutory exception to this general rule includes relief under \u00a7 3582(c)(2), which provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b572-17\">[I]n the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"551\">*551</page-number>has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. [\u00a7 ] 994(o), upon motion of the defendant or the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, or on its own motion, the court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in [18 U.S.C. \u00a7 8553(a) ] to the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b573-5\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The Sentencing Commission\u2019s recently revised policy statement on retroactive amendments to the Guidelines provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b573-6\">In a case in which a defendant is serving a term of imprisonment, and the guideline range applicable to that defendant has subsequently been lowered as a result of an amendment to the Guidelines Manual listed in subsection (c) below, the court may reduce the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment as provided by [\u00a7 3582(c)(2) ]. As required by [\u00a7 3582(c)(2) ], any such reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment shall be consistent with this policy statement.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A0s\">U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(l) (made effective on March 3, 2008, by Amendment 712). The policy statement emphasizes that \u201c[a] reduction in the defendant\u2019s term of imprisonment is not consistent with this policy statement and therefore is not authorized under [\u00a7 3582(c)(2) ] if ... [a]n amendment listed in subsection (c) does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). In this regard, the commentary to \u00a7 1B1.10 explains that a reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) is not authorized if the \u201camendment ... is applicable to the defendant but the amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range because of the operation of another guideline or statutory provision <em>(e.g., </em>a statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment).\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment. (n.l(A)).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-8\">On November 1, 2007, the Sentencing Commission promulgated Amendment 706, which amended the Drug Quantity Table in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c). U.S.S.GApp. C, Amend. 706 (2007). The effect of Amendment 706 is to provide a two-level reduction in base offense levels for certain crack-cocaine offenses. <em>See id. </em>The Commission made this amendment retroactively applicable, effective as of March 3, 2008. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G., App. C, Amend. 713 (Supp. May 1, 2008) (listing Amendment 706 under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 IB 1.10(c) as a retroactively applicable amendment).</p>\n<p id=\"b573-9\">A district court lacks authority to grant a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) \u201c[w]here a retroactively applicable guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon which his or her sentence was based.\u201d <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323, 1330 (11th Cir. 2008). Although Amendment 706 would reduce a defendant\u2019s base offense level, it would not affect his guideline range where he was sentenced as a career offender under \u00a7 4B1.1. <em>Id. </em>This was also true when the district court had granted a \u00a7 5K1.1 downward departure motion that resulted in a lower sentence than the career offender minimum sentence but did not base the new sentence on the guidelines range that would have been appropriate had Moore not been a career offender. <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b573-10\">The district court did not err in finding that Amendment 706 had no effect on Ball\u2019s offense level because he was sentenced as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.1 and the court did not base his sentence adjusted by the downward departure on the guidelines range that would have been appropriate had he not been a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"552\">*552</page-number>career offender. Additionally, we have held <em>\u201cBooker </em>is a Supreme Court decision, not a retroactively applicable guideline amendment by the Sentencing Commission. Therefore, <em>Booker </em>is inapplicable to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motions.\u201d <em>United States v. Moreno, </em>421 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th Cir. 2005). Furthermore, the plain language of \u00a7 3582(c)(2) clearly authorizes a lower court to reduce a sentence only where a defendant\u2019s original sentencing range has been reduced by the Sentencing Commission. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b574-5\">AFFIRMED.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b574-7\">.
