We have jurisdiction pursuant to 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252, <em>Morales v. Gonzales, </em>478 F.3d 972, 980 (9th Cir.2007), and we grant the petition for review and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-19\">The BIA determined that Iniguez\u2019s failure to provide his criminal history record and fingerprints in advance of his removal hearing was a sufficient ground to deem his relief application abandoned. The BIA, however, did not have the benefit of our intervening decision in <em>Cui v. Mukasey, </em>538 F.3d 1289 (9th Cir.2008), which held that the denial of a continuance for fingerprint processing prior to April 2005 may be an abuse of discretion. We therefore remand for the BIA to reconsider its dismissal of Iniguez\u2019s appeal. <em>See id. </em>at 1292-95; <em>see also Karapetyan v. Mukasey, </em>543 F.3d 1118,1129-32 (9th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-20\">In light of our disposition, we need not address Iniguez\u2019s due process contention.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>PETITION FOR REVIEW GRANTED; REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b379-21\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
