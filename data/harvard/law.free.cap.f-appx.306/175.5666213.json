For the following reasons, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-12\">I</p>\n<p id=\"b198-13\">Merit Energy Company contracted with Appellant, Omega Natchiq, Inc., to perform construction repairs on Merit\u2019s platforms in the Gulf of Mexico. Their relationship was governed by a Master Service Agreement in which Omega agreed to \u201cfully and unconditionally release, protect, defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the indemnified Merit Parties and their respective insurers\u201d from any claims of illness, injury, or death of any Omega employees arising out of the contract work.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-14\">An Omega employee, James Stanfield, in the course of his work under the contract, allegedly sustained injuries when he struck a pole on the platform deck while being transferred from a vessel to the platform by way of a personnel basket suspended from a crane. Stanfield sued Merit. Merit moved for and was granted summary judgment, the district court finding that Merit was neither vicariously nor directly liable for Stanfield\u2019s alleged injuries.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-15\">Merit\u2019s cost of defense, $62,438.86, was borne by Merit\u2019s insurer, Appellee Travelers Insurance. Merit, at the outset of the suit, demanded that Omega provide for its defense pursuant to the Master Service Agreement. Omega, however, refused, pointing to the Louisiana Oilfield Anti-Indemnity Act.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Courts have interpreted the Act to prohibit a well owner from demanding indemnity from a contractor if there is any negligence or fault on the part of the owner.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Accordingly, Travelers, as Merit\u2019s primary insurer, shouldered the cost of defense. After summary judgment was entered finding Merit faultless, Trav<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>elers sought indemnity from Omega.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The district court granted Travelers\u2019 summary judgment motion, awarding the $62,438.86 in defense costs. Omega appeals and we review <em>de </em>novo.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">II</p>\n<p id=\"b199-6\">Omega contends on appeal, as it did at the district court, that despite the indemnity clause in the Master Services Agreement, Omega and Merit\u2019s insurer, Travelers, were solidary obligors under Louisiana law, each liable to pay Merit\u2019s defense in its entirety, but between themselves each liable for one-half.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> The district court disagreed, finding that Omega and Travelers were not solidary obligors because their obligations differed:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b199-7\">Travelers\u2019 obligation and duty to its insured is broad. It is to pay for the defense of its insured on the main demand. ... On the other hand, Omega\u2019s obligation is much narrower. Omega is to pay the indemnitee\u2019s defense costs if and only if, a finding is made that the indemnitee is free from fault.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b199-14\">Because of this timing difference as to when the obligations of Omega and Travelers arose, the district court found that they were not solidary obligors; that on paying Merit\u2019s cost of defense, Travelers became subrogated to the rights of Merit, and under the Master Services Agreement entitled to recover from Omega the full costs of defending Merit.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-15\">We review the district court\u2019s application of Louisiana law, without considering whether general maritime law applies, because this case involves analysis of a contract regarding repair work on an fixed structure and because the parties do not contend that maritime law applies.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> We hesitate to adopt the district court\u2019s reasoning for finding Omega and Travelers were not solidarity obligated to pay Merit\u2019s defense. Louisiana law is less clear on the matter than the district court order found. There are decisions from Louisiana appellate courts holding that separate insurers, liable to the same insured and for the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>same coverage, are<footnotemark>8</footnotemark> and are not<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> solidary obligors. And, in Louisiana \u201can obligation may be solidary though for one of the obligors it is subject to a condition or term.\u201d <footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Put plainly, the fact that an obligation may not be enforced against one obligor until a condition is fulfilled does not necessarily preclude solidarity between it and another obligor which is immediately liable.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">But we need not resolve whether Omega and Travelers were solidary obligors to decide this case. By the clear language of the Master Services Agreement, Omega is liable for Merit\u2019s defense costs whether or not Omega and Travelers are solidary obligors. If Omega and Travelers are solidary obligors, virile apportionment is merely a presumption and parties may agree to apportion liability differently.<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> That is the case here, as Omega agreed to \u201cunconditionally release, protect, defend, indemnify, and hold harmless\u201d Merit\u2019s insurers in precisely the situation presented. If, on the other hand, Omega and Travelers are not solidary obligors, Travelers, after paying for Merit\u2019s legal defense, became conventionally subrogated to Merit\u2019s right to enforce the indemnity clause in the Master Services Agreement.<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> Either way, Omega must honor its contractual obligation to indemnify Merit\u2019s insurer.
