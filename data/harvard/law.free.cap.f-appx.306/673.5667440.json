Nov. 30, 2007). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-18\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>Alt v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 517 (2d Cir.2006). Here, we conclude that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Chen\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b696-19\">An alien seeking to reopen proceedings is entitled to one motion to reopen and must file his motion no later than 90 days after the date on which the final administrative decision was rendered. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). There is no dispute that Chen\u2019s July 2007 motion was both untimely and numerically barred. <em>Id. </em>Moreover, the BIA properly found that Chen\u2019s motion did not qualify for any exception to the time and numerical limitations. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 lOOS^c)\u00ae)\u00a9.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> It is well-settled that a change in personal circumstances, such as the birth of Chen\u2019s two U.S. citizen daughters, is not evidence of changed conditions in China. <em>See Wei Guang Wang v. BIA, </em>437 F.3d 270, 273-274 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Li Yong Zheng v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>416 F.3d 129, 130-31 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-20\">The balance of Chen\u2019s arguments are entirely foreclosed by our decision in <em>Yuen Jin v. Mukasey, </em>538 F.3d 143, 156 (2d Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b696-21\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, any stay of removal that the Court previously granted in this petition is VACATED, and any pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot. Any pending request for oral argument in this petition is <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"675\">*675</page-number>DENIED in accordance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 34(a)(2), and Second Circuit Local Rule 34(b).</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b696-13\">. To the extent Chen argues that the BIA should have reopened his case under its <em>sua sponte </em>authority pursuant to 8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(a), we lack jurisdiction to consider his argument. <em>See Azmond Ali v. Gonzales, </em>448 F.3d 515, 518 (2d Cir.2006); <em>Cyrus v. Keisler, </em>505 F.3d 197, 202 (2d Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
