For the following reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-8\">Smith fled from a sheriffs deputy and a foot chase ensued. As the deputy closed in, Smith pulled a firearm and fired it, hitting no one. Smith was captured and found to be carrying crack cocaine. Pursuant to a written plea agreement, Smith pled guilty to carrying and discharging a firearm during a drug-trafficking crime in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(iii); other related charges were dismissed. The presentenee report (\u201cPSR\u201d) correctly stated that the advisory Guideline sentence was the 10-year statutory minimum sentence contained in \u00a7 924(c)(l)(A)(iii), <em>see </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2K2.4, but indicated that an upward departure might be warranted. The district court conducted a three-stage sentencing hearing, focusing primarily on the circumstances of the gun\u2019s discharge. The court determined that Smith\u2019s original story that the gun accidently fired in his pocket was contrary to the evidence and that Smith had intentionally fired the weapon. The court then imposed a 15-year sentence.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Smith appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b208-12\">We review sentences for reasonableness in light of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Sanchez-Ramirez, </em>497 F.3d 531, 534 (5th Cir.2007). A reviewing court must first ensure that the sentence is not unreasonable due to a procedural error \u201csuch as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence-including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). If the reviewing court deems the district court\u2019s sentencing decision to be procedurally reasonable, the court should then consider whether the sentence is substantively reasonable under \u201cthe totality of the circumstances, including the extent of any variance from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Id. </em>When a sentence is outside the Guidelines range, the reviewing court \u201cmust give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"187\">*187</page-number>justify the extent of the variance.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The Supreme Court has rejected \u201can appellate rule that requires \u2018extraordinary\u2019 circumstances to justify a sentence outside the Guidelines range\u201d as well as \u201cthe use of a rigid mathematical formula that uses the percentage of a departure as the standard for determining the strength of the justifications required for a specific sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 595.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-5\">Smith initially raises several procedural challenges to his sentence. Because he failed to object at sentencing, these challenges are reviewed for plain error. <em>See United States v. Peltier, </em>505 F.3d 389, 391-92 (5th Cir.2007) <em>cert, denied, </em>\u2014 U.S. \u2014, 128 S.Ct. 2959, 171 L.Ed.2d 892 (2008). To prevail on plain-error review, a defendant must show a clear or obvious error that affected his substantial rights. <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732-35, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993). If the defendant does so, we have discretion to correct the forfeited error if the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <em>Id. </em>at 736,113 S.Ct. 1770.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-8\">Smith first contends that the district court failed to set forth adequate reasons for his sentence. In explaining a chosen sentence, \u201c[t]he sentencing judge should set forth enough to satisfy the appellate court that he has considered the parties\u2019 arguments and has a reasoned basis for exercising his own legal decision-making authority.\u201d <em>Rita v. United States, </em>551 U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2469, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007). Where the record indicates that the court has considered the evidence and arguments, a short statement may be sufficient. <em>See id. </em>at 2468-69. Here, the district court held a three-stage hearing to determine whether Smith intentionally fired the weapon and thereby purposefully endangered the deputy. At the conclusion, the court explained that it had considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors and decided to impose 15 years because \u201cSmith used a firearm while committing or attempting to commit an offense which has as an element the attempted use or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another.\u201d Viewed in context of the sentencing proceedings, this statement clearly implicates the danger to the deputy created by Smith\u2019s intentional drawing and discharging of the firearm. Moreover, the court had previously stated that it (1) accepted expert testimony that the gun did not accidently discharge in Smith\u2019s pocket as Smith initially claimed; (2) found Smith\u2019s actions to be \u201cextremely dangerous\u201d; and (3) believed that Smith failed to adequately take responsibility for the danger to the deputy. Thus, viewing the proceedings as a whole, it is clear that the district court imposed the 15-year sentence based on the intentionally created danger to the deputy and Smith\u2019s failure to accept responsibility. No further explanation is necessary. <em>See Rita, </em>127 S.Ct. at 2468-69.</p>\n<p id=\"b209-10\">Second, Smith contends that court improperly relied on the inherent danger of using a firearm as a factor in enhancing his sentence. He argues that any such danger was previously taken into account in formulating the 10-year Guidelines sentence. It is clear that the district court relied on more than just the inherent danger of a firearm in selecting a sentence. Moreover, the district court was not precluded from imposing a non-Guidelines sentence based on a factor that the Guidelines had already taken it into account. <em>See United States v. Brantley, </em>537 F.3d 347, 350 (5th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b209-11\">Third, Smith asserts that the district court did not find facts to justify a departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5K2.21. Section 5K2.21 provides for an upward departure \u201cto reflect the actual seriousness of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"188\">*188</page-number>offense based on [uncharged] conduct.\u201d \u00a7 5K2.21; <em>United States v. Newsom, </em>508 F.3d 731, 734 (5th Cir.2007). There is no indication that the court attempted to justify a departure under \u00a7 5K2.21, and thus Smith has shown no error.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-4\">Smith also raises several challenges to the substantive reasonableness of his sentence. He contends that the sentence was \u201cunjustified\u201d because there was no compelling reason for the upward departure. However, the record supports the district court\u2019s implicit conclusion that Smith intentionally fired the gun as the deputy approached. The increased danger to the deputy presented by the gun\u2019s intentional discharge concerns \u201cthe nature and the circumstances of the offense\u201d under \u00a7 3553(a)(1) and the \u201cseriousness of the offense\u201d under \u00a7 3553(a)(2)(A). <em>See Sanchez-Ramirez, </em>497 F.3d at 535 (upholding above-Guidelines sentence where the conduct was \u201cmore egregious than the normal alien-smuggling case\u201d on account of the grave danger posed to the smuggled aliens). Furthermore, it is clear that Smith presented several different versions of the offense and failed to take full responsibility for the danger.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-5\">Finally, Smith contends that the degree of the departure or variance was excessive. Smith\u2019s contention that he would have received a lesser sentence had he gone to trial and been convicted on all counts is purely speculative. There is no indication in the record that, after a trial, the district court would not have increased the sentence based on danger to the deputy. Further, the statutory minimum of 10 years would have been imposed in addition to any punishment for the associated drug crime. <em>See </em>\u00a7 924(c)(1)(A). Finally, this court has upheld departures or variances similar to or greater than the 50% increase in Smith\u2019s sentence. <em>See, e.g., Brantley, </em>537 F.3d at 348-50 (variance from guideline maximum of 51 months to sentence of 180 months); <em>United States v. Williams, </em>517 F.3d 801, 811 (5th Cir.2008) (variance from guideline maximum of 121 months to sentence of 172 months); <em>United States v. Herrera-Garduno, </em>519 F.3d 526, 530 (5th Cir.2008) (departure or variance to 60 months, up from guideline maximum of 27 months). Smith has not shown that his sentence was unreasonable.</p>\n<p id=\"b210-7\">The judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b208-9\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b208-10\">. It is unclear whether the district court intended the five-year increase to be a Guidelines-based upward \"departure\u201d or a non-guideline upward \"variance.\u201d However, the characterization is irrelevant in this case because \"the sentence imposed was reasonable \u2018under the totality of the relevant statutory factors.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. Brantley, </em>537 F.3d 347, 349 (5th Cir.2008) (quoting <em>United States v. Jones, </em>444 F.3d 430, 441 (5th Cir. 2006)). Further, if the sentence was a departure, sufficient notice of a possible departure was supplied by the PSR and the government\u2019s response, which indicated that the physical evidence contradicted Smith\u2019s claim of accidental discharge. <em>See United States v. Singleton, </em>49 F.3d 129, 135 (5th Cir.1995).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
