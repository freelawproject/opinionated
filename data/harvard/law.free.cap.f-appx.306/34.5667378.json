The invoices bear both companies\u2019 names, and the conclusory affidavit of a lower level corporate agent fails to establish that the sales to and receipts from Body Masters were for the sole account of J M Tull Metals, Inc.</p>\n<p id=\"b57-22\">Contrary to appellee\u2019s argument, the ambiguous stipulation entered in the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"36\">*36</page-number>bankruptcy court effected no issue preclusion against Robert T. Cline (\u201cCline\u201d) because the issue of the corporate identity of the creditor, whether Ryerson Tull, Inc. or J M Tull Metals, Inc., was not actually litigated and decided in that claim determination proceeding.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-4\">We also see no merit, from the vantage point of summary judgment appellate review, in Cline\u2019s arguments that his 1984 letter guaranty to J M Tull Metals, Inc. is unenforceable.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-5\">Based on the foregoing conclusions, we also vacate the court\u2019s 60(b) ruling on evidence offered untimely by Cline, because the court should reconsider its admissibility in connection with further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b58-6\">Accordingly, the judgment of the district court is VACATED and REMANDED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b57-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
