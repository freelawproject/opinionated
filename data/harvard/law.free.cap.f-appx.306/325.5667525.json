Having carefully reviewed the record, we deny the petition. <em>See Carmenatte-Lopez v. Mukasey, </em>518 F.3d 540, 541 (8th Cir.2008) (standard of review).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-22\">We conclude that, given Vasquez\u2019s asserted bases for asylum and the record below, substantial evidence supports the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Vasquez did not establish past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution on account of a protected ground. <em>See INS v. Elias-Zacarias, </em>502 U.S. 478, 479-80, 482-84, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (upholding denial of asylum to Guatemalan citizen who claimed to have fled guerilla forces attempting to recruit him, as record did not show guerillas sought to recruit him based on his political opinion; it is not sufficient that guerillas were attempting to fill their ranks); <em>Gomez v. Gonzales, </em>425 F.3d 543, 545-47 (8th Cir.2005) (to reverse finding that alleged persecution was not based on protected ground, record must compel finding that protected ground motivated persecutors\u2019 actions; asylum applicants presented only conclusory allegation that soldiers\u2019 motivation in beating them was related to imputed political opinion, where soldiers said nothing about applicants\u2019 political opinions and no other event supported such an imputation). Vasquez\u2019s claim for withholding of removal \u2014 which carries a more rigorous burden of proof\u2014 necessarily fails as well. <em>See Makatengkeng v. Gonzales, </em>495 F.3d 876, 885 (8th Cir .2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b347-23\">Vasquez\u2019s remaining arguments provide no basis for granting his petition for review, and accordingly we deny it.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
