Del Sol contends that the existence of the statutory mandatory minimum did not prevent the district court from sentencing him in accordance with U.S.S.G. Amendment 706, which otherwise lowered the base offense level for crack cocaine offenses. He further asserts that the district court erred by not considering the \u00a7 3558(a) factors when ruling on his motion, particularly that his sentence was \u201cgreater than necessary\u201d to satisfy the purposes of sentencing. Finally, he argues that 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(b)(1)(A) violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p id=\"b484-8\">We review for abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s decision not to reduce a sentence, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2), based on a subsequent change in the Sentencing Guidelines. <em>United States v. Brown, </em>332 F.3d 1341, 1343 (11th Cir. 2003). In a \u00a7 3582(c)(2) proceeding, \u201cwe review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s legal conclusions regarding the scope of its authority under the Sentencing Guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. White, </em>305 F.3d 1264, 1267 (11th Cir.2002). \u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>questions of statutory interpretation.\u201d <em>United States v. Maupin, </em>520 F.3d 1304, 1306 (11th Cir.2008).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b484-13\">A district court generally may not modify a term of imprisonment once it has been imposed. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c). An exception, however, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b484-14\">[I]n the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 994(o), upon motion of the defendant or the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, or on its own motion, the court may reduce the term of imprisonment, after considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is consistent with applicable policy statements by the Sentencing Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AeX\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). A reduction of a term of imprisonment is not \u201cconsistent with applicable policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission\u201d \u2014 and is, therefore, not authorized under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) \u2014 if the retroactive amendment does not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b484-15\">When a district court sentences a defendant under the guidelines, and a statutorily required minimum sentence is \u201cgreater than the maximum of the applicable guideline range, the statutorily required minimum sentence shall be the guideline sentence.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5Gl.l(b). Furthermore, the district court is precluded from reducing a defendant\u2019s term of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"463\">*463</page-number>imprisonment under \u00a7 3582(c)(2) to a term that is less than the minimum of an amended guideline range. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(b)(2)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-5\">The Sentencing Commission amended the drug quantity table in U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2Dl.l(c), in November 2007, following Del Sol\u2019s sentence, to reduce offense levels in cocaine base (\u201ccrack cocaine\u201d) cases by two levels. <em>See </em>U.S.S.GApp. C, Amend. 706 (2007). The Amendment was made retroactive as of March 3, 2007, by incorporation into \u00a7 lB1.10(c). <em>See </em>U.S.S.G.App. C, Amend 713 (Supp. May 1, 2008).<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Although the retroactive effect of Amendment 706 allows some defendants to seek sentence reductions, a defendant whose original sentence ultimately was based on something other than the offense level calculation under \u00a7 2D1.1 is precluded from receiving a reduction because the amendment does not have the effect of lowering the applicable guideline range. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B). This occurs where, as here, the defendant was sentenced to a mandatory minimum sentence. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.10, comment (n.l) (noting that eligibility under \u00a7 3582 is \u201ctriggered only by an amendment listed in subsection (c) that lowers the applicable guideline range\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-6\">We have noted that \u201cCongress has only authorized departures from statutory mandatory m\u00ednimums in limited circumstances.\u201d <em>United States v. Ciszkowski, </em>492 F.3d 1264, 1270 (11th Cir.2007) (finding that the only two circumstances in which a court can depart downward from a statutory minimum sentence are when the government files a motion to recognize a defendant\u2019s substantial assistance pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(e), or a defendant falls within the provisions of the \u201csafety valve\u201d embodied in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(f)). Further, in <em>Kimbrough v. United States, </em>552 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), the Supreme Court held that a district court has authority to grant a variance based on the crack-to-powder cocaine disparity, but a district court must still follow mandatory statutory minimum sentences. <em>Kimbrough, </em>552 U.S. at-, 128 S.Ct. at 573-74 (noting that district courts remain \u201cconstrained by the mandatory m\u00ednimums Congress prescribed in the 1986 Act\u201d). Likewise, Booker;<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> did not affect the mandatory nature of statutory minimum sentences. <em>See Ciszkowski, </em>492 F.3d at 1270 (holding that, even after <em>Booker, </em>courts are still bound by statutory minimum penalties). Similarly, we have held that a \u00a7 3582 proceeding is not the forum in which to raise challenges to matters that are not related to the permissible grounds for departure, as defined in the text of \u00a7 3582. <em>See United States v. Bravo, </em>203 F.3d 778, 782 (11th Cir.2000) (rejecting defendant\u2019s Eighth Amendment-based argument in a \u00a7 3582 as an extraneous re-sentencing issue that should be brought in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 proceeding).</p>\n<p id=\"b485-14\">In <em>United States v. Moore, </em>541 F.3d 1323 (11th Cir.2008), we recently held that, if the defendant was sentenced as a career offender under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4Bl.l(a) and the sentencing range was not affected by U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2D1.1, then the sentence was not \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1325-30. We explained that \u201cwhere a retroactively applicable guideline amendment reduces a defendant\u2019s base offense level, but does not alter the sentencing range upon <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"464\">*464</page-number>which his or her reduction was based, \u00a7 3582(c)(2) does not authorize a reduction in sentence.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1330. Similarly, in <em>United States v. Thomas, </em>545 F.3d 1300, 1302 (11th Cir.2008), we found that the reasoning in <em>Moore </em>applied to a defendant sentenced under the guideline for armed career criminals, U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4B1.4. Most significantly, in <em>United States v. Williams, </em>549 F.3d 1337, 1339 (11th Cir.2008), we held that the same reasoning applied to a defendant sentenced pursuant to a minimum mandatory term of imprisonment.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-4\">Because Del Sol was sentenced to an applicable statutory mandatory minimum term of imprisonment, resulting in a sentence that ultimately was based on something other than the offense level calculation under \u00a7 2D1.1, Amendment 706 did not reduce his sentencing range, and he was precluded from receiving a sentence reduction under \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s denial of a reduction.</p>\n<p id=\"b486-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b484-9\">. For purposes of this appeal, we will assume that Del Sol presented each of the preceding arguments to the district court in the first instance, although that is not entirely clear from the present record.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b485-7\">.
