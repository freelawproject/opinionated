Acuna asserts he was unaware of the presence of any firearms in the house where the cocaine was found. A defendant\u2019s guidelines offense level may be enhanced under \u00a7 2D1.1(b)(1) if the possession of a firearm by a coconspirator was reasonably foreseeable. <em>See United States v. Hernandez, </em>457 F.3d 416, 423 (5th Cir. 2006). Because there is evidence that Acuna\u2019s codefendant possessed a firearm while he and Acuna were engaged in rewrapping a large quantity of cocaine, the district court did not clearly err by inferring that his codefendant\u2019s possession of a dangerous weapon was reasonably foreseeable. <em>See United States v. Thomas, </em>120 F.3d 564, 574 (5th Cir.1997); <em>United States v. Castillo, </em>77 F.3d 1480, 1498 (5th Cir.1996).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-6\">Acuna also argues that the district court erred by denying his request for a downward adjustment of his offense level based on his minor or minimal role in the offense. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3B1.2. One of Acuna\u2019s codefendants stated that, when he arrived at the stash house, Acuna stated that he had been sent by other conspirators to help with the impending cocaine delivery. In addition, Acuna acknowledged that he agreed to help rewrap a large quantity of cocaine, which was a step leading to its further distribution. Because the district court\u2019s finding that Acuna was not a minor or minimal participant is plausible in light of the record read as a whole, we conclude that the district court did not clearly err in finding that Acuna was not entitled to this reduction. <em>See United States v. Villanueva, </em>408 F.3d 193, 203 (5th Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b175-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b174-17\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
