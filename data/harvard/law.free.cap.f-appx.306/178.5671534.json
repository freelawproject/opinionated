However, disputes arose over his proper employment position, his seniority, and his backpay at the USPS. Smith, a member of the American Postal Workers Union, pursued grievances against the USPS. However, believing that the Union did not fairly represent him in these grievances, Smith changed his target and filed a pro se suit against the Union and a number of Union members. Smith\u2019s third amended complaint claims, in pari, breach of the Union\u2019s duty of fair representation, violation of the prohibition of political recommendations for employment within the postal service, violation of the National Labor Relation Act, discrimination based on race and sex, and breach of contract.</p>\n<p id=\"b202-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>We review the district court\u2019s dismissal of Smith\u2019s case de novo.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The district court did not err in dismissing the claims against the individual defendants as they were not proper defendants.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> We also affirm the district court\u2019s dismissal of Smith\u2019s suit against the Union for failure to state a claim on any of the alleged causes of action because, as stated in the magistrate\u2019s report, Smith\u2019s complaint is a combination of conclusory allegations and facts, that even when taken as true, are not sufficient as a matter of law to entitle him to relief.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> In so ruling, the district court, despite Smith\u2019s contention to the contrary, considered the affidavits and other documents attached to the complaint, as made clear in the magistrate\u2019s report. Smith also claims that the district court erred by refusing to grant his motion to transfer his case to another magistrate for pretrial proceedings. The consent of the parties is not required for a district court to refer a motion to dismiss to a magistrate under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B).<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> Moreover, the magistrate judge generously considered Smith\u2019s motion as a motion to recuse under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 144 and did not abuse her discretion in finding no personal bias against Smith.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b201-14\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
