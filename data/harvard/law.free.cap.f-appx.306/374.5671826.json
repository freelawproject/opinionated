Games was convicted in the California Superior Court of one count of attempted murder, Cal-Penal Code \u00a7\u00a7 664, 187; one count of simple assault, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 240; one count of assault with a deadly weapon, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 245(b); and one count of discharge of a firearm with gross negligence, <em>id. </em>\u00a7 246.3. The jury also found true several enhancements for use of a firearm. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(a), and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b397-16\">Because Garnes\u2019s claims are governed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d), habeas relief may be granted only upon a finding that the last reasoned state court decision rejecting Garnes\u2019s claims \u201cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(d); <em>see Avila v. Galaza, </em>297 F.3d 911, 917-18 (9th Cir.2002). We review de novo the district court\u2019s denial of the petition. <em>See Arredondo v. Ortiz, </em>365 F.3d 778, 781 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b397-17\">None of Garnes\u2019s claims warrants habeas relief under AEDPA. First, Games failed to meet the \u201cheavy burden\u201d of showing that there was insufficient evidence presented to the jury to support his attempted murder conviction.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>Juan H. v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"376\">*376</page-number><em>Allen, </em>408 F.3d 1262, 1274 (9th Cir.2005). A rational trier of fact could have found beyond a reasonable doubt that Games had the specific intent to kill the alleged victim, Ronald Burks. <em>See Jackson v. Virginia, </em>443 U.S. 307, 324, 99 S.Ct. 2781, 61 L.Ed.2d 560 (1979). Leading up to the shooting incident, Games and Burks were involved in several physical altercations. Games told his sister to \u201c[g]o get [his] gun.\u201d Burks testified that Games pointed a gun at him and said, \u201c[y]eah, you,\u201d and that Games shot at him from a distance of approximately twenty-two feet. Several prosecution witnesses testified that they saw Games shoot at Burks. Their testimony was corroborated by substantial physical evidence. We must presume that the trier of fact resolved conflicting inferences in favor of the prosecution. <em>Id. </em>at 326, 99 S.Ct. 2781. In light of the evidence presented, we conclude that the California Court of Appeal\u2019s decision was not an \u201cobjectively unreasonable\u201d application of <em>Jackson </em>to the facts of this case.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> <em>Juan H., </em>408 F.3d at 1275 n. 13.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-4\">Second, the trial court did not violate Garnes\u2019s constitutional rights to confront the witnesses against him or to present a complete defense by excluding relevant evidence of criminal charges pending against Burks. We agree with the district court that two of Garnes\u2019s arguments as to why the evidence should have been admitted were proeedurally barred, which precludes our review. <em>See Calderon v. U.S. Dist. Court (Bean), </em>96 F.3d 1126, 1129 (9th Cir.1996). Even if these arguments were not proeedurally barred, we would conclude that the Court of Appeal\u2019s decision upholding the trial court\u2019s exclusion of the evidence in question was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of <em>Delaware v. Van Arsdall, </em>475 U.S. 673, 678-84, 106 S.Ct. 1431, 89 L.Ed.2d 674 (1986), or any other Supreme Court precedent. <em>See California v. Trombetta, </em>467 U.S. 479, 485-91, 104 S.Ct. 2528, 81 L.Ed.2d 413 (1984); <em>Chambers v. Mississippi, </em>410 U.S. 284, 294-98, 93 S.Ct. 1038, 35 L.Ed.2d 297 (1973). The trial court allowed other impeachment evidence to be admitted against Burks. Further, the court based its ruling on the substantiated concern that Burks would invoke the Fifth Amendment, as well as the stated desires of both the prosecution and defense counsel that Burks testify in person.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-7\">Nor was the Court of Appeal\u2019s rejection of Games\u2019s third claim contrary to or an unreasonable application of Supreme Court precedent. <em>See Estelle v. McGuire, </em>502 U.S. 62, 67-68, 112 S.Ct. 475, 116 L.Ed.2d 385 (1991). Games argues that the trial court violated his rights to due process by admitting evidence that Games previously had sold drugs. However, the admission of this prior bad acts evidence was not \u201cclearly prejudicial,\u201d nor did it render Garnes\u2019s trial \u201cfundamentally unfair.\u201d <em>Drayden v. White, </em>232 F.3d 704, 710 (9th Cir.2000) (internal quotation marks omitted). The jury permissibly could have inferred from this evidence that Games intended to kill Burks to eliminate him as competition for selling drugs or to retaliate for selling on his \u201cturf.\u201d Moreover, Games admitted on direct examination that he previously sold drugs.</p>\n<p id=\"b398-8\">We also conclude that the Court of Appeal was not objectively unreasonable in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"377\">*377</page-number>rejecting Garnes\u2019s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel based on his failure to object to the admission of the prior drug sales against Games. We need not address whether Garnes\u2019s counsel provided ineffective assistance because Games failed to demonstrate prejudice. <em>See Strickland v. Washington, </em>466 U.S. 668, 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984) (\u201cThe defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\u2019s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different. A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\u201d); <em>see also Woodford v. Visciotti, </em>537 U.S. 19, 25, 123 S.Ct. 357, 154 L.Ed.2d 279 (2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-5\">Games also raises two claims of instructional error. The Court of Appeal summarily rejected Garnes\u2019s first claim that the trial court erred in giving the willfully false witness instruction pursuant to California Jury Instruction, Criminal (\u201cCALJIC\u201d) No. 2.21.2. The California Supreme Court previously has rejected an identical challenge to this instruction, <em>People v. Riel, </em>22 Cal.4th 1153, 96 Cal.Rptr.2d 1, 998 P.2d 969, 1002 (2000), and we have followed its approach, <em>see, e.g., Turner v. Calderon, </em>281 F.3d 851, 865-66 (9th Cir. 2002) (declining to issue a certificate of appealability on the habeas petitioner\u2019s claim that CALJIC No. 2.21.2 violated due process). Because the instruction did not \u201cby itself so infectf ] the entire trial that the resulting conviction violate[d] due process,\u201d <em>Estelle, </em>502 U.S. at 72, 112 S.Ct. 475 (internal quotation marks omitted), the Court of Appeal did not act unreasonably in rejecting Games\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-6\">We accept on habeas review the Court of Appeal\u2019s conclusion that the trial court erred as a matter of state law in instructing the jury pursuant to CALJIC No. 1.22 (defining malice), in addition to defining the jury pursuant to CALJIC No. 8.66 (defining elements of attempted murder). <em>See Estelle, </em>502 U.S. at 67-68, 112 S.Ct. 475 (\u201c[I]t is not the province of a federal habeas court to reexamine state-court determinations on state-law questions.\u201d). To determine whether this error entitles Games to habeas relief, we therefore consider only whether it had \u201ca substantial and injurious effect or influence in determining the jury\u2019s verdict.\u201d <em>Brecht v. Abrahamson, </em>507 U.S. 619, 623, 113 S.Ct. 1710,123 L.Ed.2d 353 (1993) (internal quotation marks omitted). We conclude that it did not. The jury was repeatedly instructed on the correct definition of malice, and there is no evidence that the jury believed the more general definition of malice applied to its decision as to whether Games was guilty of attempted murder. The Court of Appeal\u2019s conclusion that this error was harmless was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of any Supreme Court precedent.</p>\n<p id=\"b399-8\">Finally, we reject Garnes\u2019s claim that the cumulative effect of trial court errors rendered the trial fundamentally unfair. The Court of Appeal found only one error, which it reasonably concluded was harmless. Because there is no accumulation of errors here, the Court of Appeal\u2019s failure to explicitly address Garnes\u2019s cumulative error claim was not contrary to or an unreasonable application of any Supreme Court precedent, nor was its decision an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of substantial evidence presented by the government. <em>Cf. United States v. Frederick, </em>78 F.3d 1370, 1381 (9th Cir. 1996) (\u201cIn those cases where the government\u2019s case is weak, a defendant is more likely to be prejudiced by the effect of cumulative errors.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b399-9\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b397-13\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.

Games has not rebutted the factual findings of the Court of Appeal by clear and convincing evidence, so those findings must be presumed correct. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(1); <em>see Slovik v.
