Neither party challenges the ALJ\u2019s determinations that JK\u2019s Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (\u201cADHD\u201d), obesity, and migraine headaches are severe impairments, but that these impairments are not medically equivalent to a listed impairment. Brown, however, argues that (1) the ALJ failed to take into account JK\u2019s diagnosed learning disorder, and (2) JK\u2019s combined disabilities are the functional equivalent of a listed impairment.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-15\">In order for an impairment or combination of impairments to be the functional equivalent of a listed impairment, the child must show a \u201cmarked\u201d impairment in two functional areas or an \u201cextreme\u201d limitation in one area. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.926a(a). The relevant areas are: (1) acquiring and using information; (2) attending and completing tasks; (3) interacting and relating with others; (4) moving about and manipulating objects; (5) caring for oneself; and (6) health and physical well-being. 20 C.F.R. \u00a7 416.926a(b)(l). Brown contends that JK\u2019s combined impairments imposed mai'ked limitations on his abilities to acquire and use information and to attend and complete tasks. She also urges that the ALJ committed legal error by failing to determine whether JK\u2019s learning disorder was severe and to address its impact on his functioning.</p>\n<p id=\"b659-16\">We may set aside the ALJ\u2019s determination only if it is marred by legal error or unsupported by substantial evidence. <em>See Rosa v. Callahan, </em>168 F.3d 72, 77 (2d Cir.1999). The ALJ did not determine whether JK\u2019s learning disorder was \u201csevere,\u201d and substantial evidence indicates that it was. In particular, a school psychologist administered achievement and intelligence tests to JK and found that his bx'oad reading score was 65.94% below what would be predicted by his IQ. We <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"638\">*638</page-number>also are unsure whether the ALJ factored JK\u2019s learning disorder into his evaluation of JK\u2019s functional capacities. On the one hand, the ALJ stated that he had considered \u201cthe interactive and cumulative effects of all medically determinable impairments, including any impairments that are \u2018severe\u2019 and/or \u2018not severe\u2019 and referred to\u2019 the school psychologist\u2019s report when summarizing the evidence. On the other hand, the ALJ\u2019s specific assessment of JK\u2019s functioning in acquiring and using information and attending and completing tasks makes no mention of learning problems and emphasizes behavioral issues relevant to ADHD.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-4\">Notwithstanding these potential errors, we need not remand. As discussed, JK must show a \u201cmarked\u201d limitation in two-domains. While Brown argues that the learning disorder is relevant to both the contested domains, she fails to explain how it is relevant to the domain of attending and completing tasks, and the record contains no indication that it would impact this domain. JK\u2019s learning disorder affects his ability to read, not his ability to attend to tasks. Therefore, the ALJ\u2019s possible failure to consider the impact of JK\u2019s learning disorder did not infect his consideration of whether JK had a \u201cmarked\u201d limitation in attending and completing tasks. Further, substantial evidence supports the ALJ\u2019s determination that there was a \u201cless than marked\u201d limitation in this domain. The school psychologist gave generally positive ratings to attentional tasks after observing JK in his classroom.In addition, the consulting psychologist found that JK\u2019s attention and concentration were intact. The ALJ was entitled to credit this evidence over other evidence suggesting that JK\u2019s limitations were more severe.</p>\n<p id=\"b660-6\">We, therefore, affirm the order of the District Court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
