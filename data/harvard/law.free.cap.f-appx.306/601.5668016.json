Rolling appeals the decision of the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (\u201cVeterans Court\u201d) affirming the denial by the Board of Veterans\u2019 Appeals of her claim for service connection for her deceased husband\u2019s pancreatic cancer. <em>Rolling v. Nicholson, </em>No. 05-1268, 2007 WL 4967080 (Vet.App. Aug.29, 2007). Mrs. Rolling argues that the Veterans Court either erred in interpreting the law, or abused its discretion, in failing to require that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs fully comply with an earlier remand order issued by the Board requiring further development of her case. The Veterans Court had concluded that the Secretary, acting through a medical examiner, had substantially complied with the remand order. <em>Id. </em>at *6. We have carefully considered Mrs. Rolling\u2019s arguments and conclude that her appeal essentially seeks our review of a factual matter. The adequacy of the VA\u2019s compliance with a Board remand order for further medical examination is a factual matter and outside our statutory jurisdiction as provided by 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(a), (d)(2). <em>Dyment v. Principi, </em>287 F.3d 1377, 1381 (Fed.Cir.2002) (finding no jurisdiction to address claimant\u2019s argument that a VA medical specialist failed to comply with a Board remand order because the argument constituted a challenge to the Veterans Court\u2019s decision on factual matter).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b624-5\">The appeal is <em>dismissed </em>for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b624-8\">. While this court's <em>Dyment </em>decision preceded an amendment to the jurisdictional statute 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 7292(a) enacted December 6, 2002, <em>see </em>Veterans Benefits Act of 2002, Pub.L. No. 107-330, tit. IV, \u00a7 402(a), 116 Stat. 2832, that amendment did not alter the exclusion of factual matters from this court's review.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
