May 16, 2008). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"643\">*643</page-number>\u25a0with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-5\">We review the BIA\u2019s denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of discretion. <em>See Kaur v. BIA, </em>413 F.3d 232, 233 (2d Cir. 2005) (per curiam). We find that the BIA did not abuse its discretion in denying Pan\u2019s motion to reopen as untimely.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-6\">A motion to reopen must be filed within 90 days after the date on which a final administrative decision was rendered in the proceeding sought to be reopened. <em>See </em>8 C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(2). While it is well-established that the time limitation for motions to reopen may be equitably tolled to accommodate claims of ineffective assistance of counsel, a movant must demonstrate that he has exercised \u201cdue diligence\u201d in vindicating his rights. <em>See Jin Bo Zhao v. INS, </em>452 F.3d 154, 156-57 (2d Cir.2006). Here, the BIA concluded that Pan had failed to \u201cdiligently pursue his ineffective assistance claim such that equitable tolling of the filing deadline would be warranted.\u201d But even construing the arguments in Pan\u2019s pro se brief broadly, <em>see Bertin v. United States, </em>478 F.3d 489, 491 (2d Cir.2007), we find that he has failed to challenge that conclusion. Accordingly, we consider waived any argument that the BIA erred in declining to reopen Pan\u2019s proceedings based on his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel. <em>See Yueqing Zhang v. Gonzales, </em>426 F.3d 540, 545 n. 7 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n<p id=\"b665-7\">Further, we find that the BIA did not err in holding that Pan had failed to establish changed country conditions so as to qualify for an exception to the filing deadline for motions to reopen.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> <em>See 8 </em>C.F.R. \u00a7 1003.2(c)(3)(ii). We found in <em>Qin Wen Zheng v. Gonzales, </em>500 F.3d 143, 146-47 (2d Cir.2007), that the BIA may properly reject unauthenticated evidence of changed country conditions submitted with a motion to reopen where the agency made an adverse credibility determination in the underlying removal proceedings. <em>See also Siewe v. Gonzales, </em>480 F.3d 160, 170 (2d Cir.2007) (noting that \u201ca single false document or a single instance of false testimony may (if attributable to the petitioner) infect the balance of the alien\u2019s uncorroborated or unauthenticated evidence\u201d). Accordingly, the BIA properly declined to credit the unauthenticated evidence Pan submitted with his motion to reopen where the IJ had made an adverse credibility determination in the underlying proceedings. Because the BIA\u2019s finding in this regard is dispositive of Pan\u2019s petition for review, we need not reach the BIA\u2019s nexus finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b665-10\">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is DENIED. As we have completed our review, the pending motion for a stay of removal in this petition is DISMISSED as moot.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b665-8\">. We construe Pan's pro se brief as challenging the BIA's decision in this respect. <em>See Bertin, </em>478 F.3d at 491.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
