His plea agreement states \u201cdefendant knowingly and voluntarily waives any right to appeal or collaterally attack any matter in connection with [his] prosecution, conviction and sentence.\u201d Mot. to Enforce, Attach. 1 (Plea Agreement) at 119. The agreement further states \u201c[b]y entering into this agreement, the defendant knowingly waives any right to appeal a sentence imposed which is within the guideline range determined appropriate by the court.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The district court determined the advisory guideline range was 262 to 327 months and imposed a sentence of 262 months, at the low end of the range. Defendant has filed an appeal in which he seeks to challenge the district court\u2019s calculation of his sentence. The government has moved to enforce defendant\u2019s appeal waiver under <em>United States v. Hahn, </em>359 F.3d 1315 (10th Cir.2004) (en banc) (per curiam). We grant the motion and dismiss the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b457-15\">Under <em>Hahn, </em>we consider \u201c(1) whether the disputed appeal falls within the scope of the waiver of appellate rights; (2) whether the defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived his appellate rights; and (3) whether enforcing the waiver would result in a miscarriage of justice....\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1325. Defendant contends that his appeal falls within an exception to the appellate waiver. Aternatively, he argues that enforcement of the waiver would result in a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"436\">*436</page-number>Defendant\u2019s plea agreement contains the following exception \u201cdefendant waives the right to appeal the sentence imposed in this case except to the extent, if any, the court departs upwards from the applicable sentencing guideline range determined by the court.\u201d Plea Agreement at 119. It is undisputed that defendant\u2019s sentence did not involve an upward departure. Defendant argues, however, that evidence presented at his sentencing hearing supported a two to four level reduction from the guideline range determined by the court and that the use of a higher guideline level is \u201csubstantially equivalent to an upward departure.\u201d Resp. to Mot. to Enforce at <em>2.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b458-4\">Defendant\u2019s argument is precluded by the plain language of the plea agreement. In the waiver provision, he agreed to waive his right to appeal a sentence that was \u201cwithin the guideline range determined appropriate by the court\u201d and the exception applies solely to upward departures from the \u201capplicable sentencing guideline range determined by the court.\u201d Plea Agreement at U 9 (emphasis added). On appeal, he seeks to challenge the district court\u2019s findings of relevant conduct, which he admits are \u201cpart and parcel of the determination by the court of the guideline range for sentencing.\u201d Resp. to Mot. to Enforce at 3. Defendant\u2019s appeal is nothing more than a challenge to the district court\u2019s calculation of the appropriate sentencing guideline range, which was expressly waived in his plea agreement.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-5\">Defendant\u2019s miscarriage-of-justice argument also fails. He argues that there were inconsistent findings relating to the amount of methamphetamine that was attributed to him and that \u201c[t]hese inconsistent findings amount to error that seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 4 (quotation omitted). The miscarriage-of-justice exception, however, looks to whether <em>\u201cthe waiver </em>is otherwise unlawful,\u201d <em>Hahn, </em>359 F.3d at 1327 (quotation omitted and emphasis added), not whether some other aspect of the proceeding may have involved legal error. Defendant\u2019s argument that his appeal waiver should be excused due to alleged errors in the relevant conduct findings does not support the miscarriage-of-justice exception because his claim only concerns the correctness of his sentence. Because defendant has not asserted any claim regarding the relevant issue of whether the appeal waiver itself was unlawful, see <em>United States v. Porter, </em>405 F.3d 1136, 1144-45 (10th Cir.2005), defendant has not shown that enforcement of the waiver would seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b458-7\">Accordingly, we GRANT the government\u2019s motion to enforce the appeal waiver and DISMISS the appeal. Defendant\u2019s motion to file his response out of time is GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b457-13\"> This panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not materially assist the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument. This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
