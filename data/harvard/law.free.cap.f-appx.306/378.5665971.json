We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-16\">1. To establish the crime of illegal reentry after deportation, the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant entered the country \u201cfree from official restraint.\u201d <em>See United States v. Bello-Bahena, </em>411 F.3d 1083, 1087 (9th Cir.2005). Border Patrol Agent McManus described arresting Segundo approximately two miles north of the border, and identified the defendant as the person he arrested. This evidence was sufficient for a reasonable jury to have concluded that Segundo entered the United States free from \u201cofficial restraint.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 1088.</p>\n<p id=\"b401-17\">In addition, because McManus\u2019s testimony alone was sufficient to support a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"380\">*380</page-number>jury finding on this issue, the government did not rely solely, or even primarily, on Segundo\u2019s alleged confession to establish this element of the offense. The <em>corpus delicti </em>rule is therefore not implicated here. <em>See United States v. Norris, </em>428 F.3d 907, 913 (9th Cir.2005) <em>(\u201c[CJorpus delicti </em>evidence is required only when a confession is the sole basis for a conviction.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-4\">McManus also physically identified Segundo in court, thereby satisfying the government\u2019s burden to identify the defendant. <em>See United States v. Alexander, </em>48 F.3d 1477, 1490 (9th Cir.1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-5\">2. The district court did not plainly err when it admitted the fingerprint card dated 9/22/2005. The \u201claw en-' forcement exception\u201d to Fed.R.Evid. 803(8), the public records exception to the prohibition on hearsay, does not apply to the fingerprint card. Although \u201claw enforcement personnel\u201d observed and recorded the information on the card, they did so as part of the Border Patrol\u2019s \u201croutine\u201d process of booking arrestees. <em>See United States v. Weiland, </em>420 F.3d 1062, 1075 (9th Cir.2005) (\u201c[Fingerprinting and photographing a suspect ... are the types of routine and unambiguous matters to which the public records hearsay exception in Rule 803(8)(B) is designed to apply.\u201d). In addition, there was no evidence to \u201cindicate a lack of trustworthiness\u201d with respect to the card\u2019s authenticity. \u201c[T]he Government\u2019s need to keep accurate records of the movement of aliens\u201d provides a guarantee of the fingerprint card\u2019s trustworthiness, and the minimal discrepancies between the information on the 9/22/2005 card and the card dated 9/1/2005 do not raise doubts about the 9/22/2005 card\u2019s reliability. <em>See United States v. Hernandez-Rojas, </em>617 F.2d 533, 535 (9th Cir. 1980).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-6\">3. Nor did the introduction of the fingerprint card violate Segundo\u2019s Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses testifying against him. The Border Patrol rolled Segundo\u2019s fingerprints and recorded the date on the card as part of the administrative process it uses to book new detainees. As a result, the relevant information on the card was not \u201ctestimonial\u201d in nature, and therefore did not implicate the Confrontation Clause. <em>See Weiland, </em>420 F.3d at 1077 (holding that documents, even if \u201cprepared for the purposes of litigation,\u201d are not testimonial where they involve \u201croutine cataloguing of an unambiguous factual matter\u201d) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-8\">4. Segundo\u2019s final argument, that in-eourt identifications by Border Patrol Agents McManus and Frias violated his Due Process rights, also fails. Segundo argues that Agents McManus\u2019s and Frias\u2019s pre-trial review of Segundo\u2019s photograph was an impermissibly suggestive identification procedure. <em>See United States v. Montgomery, </em>150 F.3d 983, 992 (9th Cir. 1998).</p>\n<p id=\"b402-9\">Even if the pre-trial identification procedure was impermissibly suggestive, the \u201ctotality of the circumstances\u201d indicate that the agents\u2019 in-court identifications of Segundo were nonetheless \u201csufficiently reliable.\u201d <em>See id. </em>at 993. Both agents spent significant time with Segundo at the time of his arrest and detention, and both had a reason and opportunity to observe him closely. In addition, Agent McManus, who provided the crucial testimony against Segundo, testified that he had an independent recollection of Segundo\u2019s arrest. Because the agents\u2019 in-court identifications were \u201csufficiently reliable,\u201d no due process violation occurred. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b402-10\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b401-9\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
