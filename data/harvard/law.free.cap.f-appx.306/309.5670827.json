After an examination of the appellant\u2019s brief and the record, we have concluded that oral argument is unnecessary. Thus, the appeal is submitted on the appellant\u2019s brief and the record. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(A)(2).</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b332-19\">ORDER</p>\n<author id=\"b332-20\">BARBARA B. CRABB, Chief Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"b332-21\">Kairdin Alnoubani brought suit in district court claiming that he is eligible for early release from prison. Congress has granted the Bureau of Prisons discretion to reduce the sentences of inmates who complete a substance abuse treatment program, so long as they are not serving time for violent offenses. <em>See </em>18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3621(e)(2)(B). Using that discretion, the BOP has expanded by regulation the class of prisoners excluded from the sentence-reduction program. <em>See </em>28 C.F.R. \u00a7 550.58. Alnoubani now challenges the BOP\u2019s application of that regulation.</p>\n<p id=\"b332-22\">Alnoubani was convicted of conspiring to import pseudoephedrine and sentenced to 84 months in prison. While incarcerated, he completed a residential drug abuse treatment program created under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3621. After he finished the pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"311\">*311</page-number>gram, however, the prison warden concluded that he was ineligible to have his sentence reduced because he fell into one of the categories excepted by the BOP\u2019s regulation, that of offenders previously convicted for aggravated assault. <em>See </em>28 C.F.R. \u00a7 550.58(a)(iv). Alnoubani appealed that decision administratively, and finally filed this action pro se in federal court.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-5\">In his complaint, Alnoubani stated that the BOP\u2019s regulation interpreting \u00a7 3621 was unlawful for two reasons. He first alleged that the BOP \u201cviolated his right to equal protection of the laws\u201d by denying him early release but granting it to prisoners just like him. Alnoubani also claimed that the BOP\u2019s denial of early release was \u201ccontrary to law; arbitrary and capricious; an abuse of discretion.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b333-6\">Initially, the district court reviewed the complaint and concluded that Alnoubani had potentially stated two claims under the Administrative Procedure Act, which authorizes federal courts to set aside agency actions that are either unconstitutional, <em>see </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(B), or are \u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law,\u201d <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 706(2)(A). However, the court observed that Alnoubani\u2019s case was not ripe because he had not supplied proof of final agency action, <em>see id. </em>\u00a7 704; 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 542.10, and therefore granted him additional time to submit that proof.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-7\">Once Alnoubani provided the required documents, the district court screened his complaint and dismissed it for failure to state a claim. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A. The court focused primarily on his equal-protection claim, concluding that because Alnoubani had not alleged that he was a member of a protected class or stated any facts that might \u201covercome the presumption of rationality that applies to government classifications,\u201d he had not stated an equal-protection claim. The court did not, however, make any formal finding on Alnoubani\u2019s second claim, that the BOP\u2019s denial of early release was arbitrary and capricious.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-9\">We review a dismissal under \u00a7 1915A de novo, applying the same standard used for dismissals under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). <em>Lagerstrom v. Kingston, </em>463 F.3d 621, 624 (7th Cir.2006). Dismissal is appropriate only when the plaintiff can prove no set of facts that would entitle him to relief. <em>Marshall v. Knight, </em>445 F.3d 965, 968 (7th Cir.2006). All a plaintiff must do to survive dismissal at this stage is to provide a \u201cshort and plain statement of the claim showing that [he] is entitled to relief.\u201d Fed.R.CivP. 8; <em>see also Edwards v. Snyder, </em>478 F.3d 827, 830 (7th Cir.2007). Pro se complaints are liberally construed and need not meet the more exacting standards applied to pleadings prepared by lawyers. <em>Kaba v. Stepp, </em>458 F.3d 678, 681, 687 (7th Cir.2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b333-10\">On appeal, Alnoubani first challenges the dismissal of his equal-protection claim. That can be disposed of briefly. The district court correctly concluded that, in order to survive dismissal for failure to state an equal-protection claim, \u201ca plaintiff must allege facts sufficient to overcome the presumption of rationality that applies to government classifications.\u201d <em>St. John\u2019s United Church of Christ v. City of Chicago, </em>502 F.3d 616, 639 (7th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>Wroblewski v. City of Washburn, </em>965 F.2d 452, 460 (7th Cir.1992)). Alnoubani does not even attempt to argue that the BOP\u2019s regulation is not rationally related to some government purpose. <em>See id. </em>The district court therefore properly dismissed his equal-protection claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b333-11\">Alnoubani also argues, however, that the district court ignored his claim that the BOP was \u201carbitrary and capricious\u201d in relying on 28 C.F.R, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"312\">*312</page-number>\u00a7 550.58(a)(iv) to deny him early release. Alnoubani sharpens the point in his brief on appeal, clarifying that \u201cthe BOP never articulated a reasonable basis for its decision to deny [him] a sentence reduction.\u201d This claim closely tracks section 706(2)(A) of the APA, which requires that agencies provide a rationale when they exercise their discretion. <em>See Black v. Educ. Credit Mgmt. Corp., </em>459 F.3d 796, 799-800 (7th Cir.2006); <em>see also United States v. Sawyer, </em>521 F.3d 792, 794-95 (7th Cir.2008) (suggesting that a claim under the APA may be an appropriate method for appealing the BOP\u2019s administration of a prison program). As Alnoubani notes, it is a claim that the Ninth Circuit recently found persuasive. In <em>Arrington v. Daniels, </em>516 F.3d 1106 (9th Cir.2008), that court held that 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 550.58-the same provision under which the BOP denied Alnoubani early release \u2014 is arbitrary and capricious because the BOP did not offer any rationale for categorically excluding from the early-release program inmates with convictions involving firearms. <em>Id. </em>at 1111-13. As in <em>Arrington, </em>the administrative record here reflects no rationale for denying Alnoubani early release aside from the BOP\u2019s reliance on the regulation and a \u201cprogram statement\u201d interpreting it. <em>Id. </em>at 1112-13.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-4\">The district court, to the extent it considered the issue, seemed to think the APA claim barred by <em>Lopez v. Davis, </em>531 U.S. 230, 239-41, 121 S.Ct. 714, 148 L.Ed.2d 635 (2001), in which the Supreme Court endorsed the BOP\u2019s discretion to narrow the class of prisoners eligible for early release under \u00a7 3621. However, the court did not acknowledge <em>Lopez\u2019s </em>proviso that regulations promulgated by the BOP in its discretion must not be arbitrary or capricious. <em>See Lopez, </em>531 U.S. at 240,121 S.Ct. 714. Nor did the court note the APA\u2019s requirement that agencies articulate a rationale when they exercise their discretion. <em>See Black, </em>459 F.3d at 799-800. <em>Lopez </em>does not, therefore, bar Alnoubani\u2019s APA claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-6\">Alnoubani\u2019s complaint, construed liberally, alleges that the BOP has failed to provide any reason for excluding from the early-release program offenders previously convicted of aggravated assault. This is enough to put the BOP on notice of his claim, which is all that Rule 8 requires. <em>See Christensen v. County of Boone, </em>483 F.3d 454, 458 (7th Cir.2007). We take no position on the merits of the question taken up by the Ninth Circuit in <em>Arrington, </em>but conclude that it was premature for the district court to dismiss this claim. The district court\u2019s dismissal of Alnoubani\u2019s equal-protection claim is affirmed, and its dismissal of his APA claim is vacated and remanded for further proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b334-7\">AFFIRM in part, VACATE and REMAND in part.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
