Zambrano Nataren\u2019s sole argument is that the district court erred when it increased his offense level by sixteen levels pursuant to <em>U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual </em>(\u201cUSSG\u201d) \u00a7 2L1.2 (b)(l)(A)(ii) (2007). Finding no error, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b832-17\">Although Zambrano Nataren generally complained at sentencing that he was unhappy with his Guidelines range because it was greater than he anticipated, Zambrano Nataren filed no objections to his presentence investigation report (\u201cPSR\u201d) and specifically informed the district court that he had no objections to the PSR. Because Zambrano Nataren did not raise his claim of error before the district court, we review for plain error. <em>See United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b832-18\">To establish plain error, Zambrano Nataren was required to show that an error occurred, that it was plain, and that it affected his substantial rights. <em>See id. </em>at 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770. We have reviewed the record and have considered Zambrano Nataren\u2019s arguments. We conclude that it was not error, plain or otherwise, for the district court to adopt the PSR\u2019s calculation of Zambrano Nataren\u2019s Guidelines range and sentence him to the bottom of the properly calculated range. <em>See United States v. Go, </em>517 F.3d 216, 218 (4th Cir. 2008); <em>see also Rita v. United States, </em>551 <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"811\">*811</page-number>U.S. 338, 127 S.Ct. 2456, 2462-69, 168 L.Ed.2d 203 (2007) (upholding presumption of reasonableness for within-Guidelines sentence).</p>\n<p id=\"b833-5\">Accordingly, we affirm the district court\u2019s judgment. We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b833-6\">\n<em>AFFIRMED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
