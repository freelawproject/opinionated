HOLMES, Circuit Judge.</author>\n<p id=\"ArK\">Defendant-Appellant Duane Hamilton, appearing pro se, argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying his 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion for reduction of sentence. We exercise jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Reviewing Mr. Hamilton\u2019s filings liberally,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> we conclude that the district court properly denied Mr. Hamilton\u2019s \u00a7 3582 motion. Accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b445-7\">Mr. Hamilton pleaded guilty to possession with the intent to distribute 50 grams or more of cocaine base (\u201ccrack\u201d), in violation of 21 U.S.C. \u00a7 841(a)(1), (b)(l)(A)(iii), and carrying firearms during and in relation to a drug trafficking crime, in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(c)(1)(A)\u00ae. Mr. Hamilton was classified as a career offender. Accordingly, as applicable here, Mr. Hamilton\u2019s Guidelines range was determined under U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual (U.S.S.G.) \u00a7 4B1.1 by taking the greater of (1) the Guidelines range that results from adding the mandatory minimum penalty of the firearms count under \u00a7 924(c) to the minimum and maximum of the otherwise applicable Guidelines range for the drug offense, and (2) the Guidelines range determined using the table set forth in \u00a7 4Bl.l(c)(3). The former yielded the greater Guidelines range \u2014 specifically, 322 to 387 months. This Court affirmed Mr. Hamilton\u2019s sentence on direct appeal. <em>United, States v. Hamilton, </em>510 F.3d 1209 (10th Cir.2007), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 128 S.Ct. 1922, 170 L.Ed.2d 782 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"AP8\">Subsequently, Mr. Hamilton filed a motion for reduction of sentence pursuant to 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2). The district court denied Mr. Hamilton\u2019s motion, finding that Amendment 706 did not lower Mr. Hamilton\u2019s applicable Guidelines range. Mr. Hamilton appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b445-12\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b445-13\">\u201cWe review de novo the district court\u2019s interpretation of a statute or the sentencing guidelines.\u201d <em>United States v. Smartt, </em>129 F.3d 539, 540 (10th Cir.1997) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). \u201cWe review for an abuse of discretion a district court\u2019s decision to deny a reduction in sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>United States v. Sharkey, </em>543 F.3d 1236, 1238 (10th Cir.2008). When, as here, a \u201cmotion for sentence reduction is not a direct appeal or a collateral attack under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, the viability of (the] motion depends entirely on 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c).\u201d <em>Smartt, </em>129 F.3d at 540 (citation, internal quotation marks and alteration omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b445-15\">Section 3582(c)(2) states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b445-16\">[I]n the case of a defendant who has been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission ... the court may reduce the term of imprisonment, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"424\">*424</page-number>after considering the factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable, if such a reduction is <em>consistent with applicable policy statements </em>issued by the Sentencing Commission.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b446-4\">18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) (emphasis added). A reduction of a term of imprisonment is not authorized (i.e., not consistent with applicable policy statements) under \u00a7 3582(c) if the amendment \u201cdoes not have the effect of lowering the defendant\u2019s applicable guideline range.\u201d U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.10(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p id=\"b446-5\">\u201cAmendment 706 lowered the base offense level [under \u00a7 2D1.1] for drug offenses involving crack cocaine.\u201d <em>United States v. Leroy, </em>No. 08-5088, 298 Fed. Appx. 711, 713 (10th Cir. Oct.21, 2008). \u201cHowever, Amendment 706 had no effect on the career offender guidelines in \u00a7 4B1.1, which were the guidelines used by the district court in sentencing [Mr. Hamilton].\u201d <em>Sharkey, </em>543 F.3d at 1239. Since Amendment 706 does not have the effect of lowering Mr. Hamilton\u2019s applicable Guidelines range, his motion for relief pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2) was properly denied.</p>\n<p id=\"b446-6\">Further, we reject Mr. Hamilton\u2019s argument that <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), should apply to sentencing modification proceedings pursuant to \u00a7 3582(c)(2). Mr. Hamilton argues that the district court had the discretion to impose a non-guideline sentence under <em>Booker. </em>Aplt. Br. at 8. However, we rejected this argument in <em>United States v. Rhodes, </em>549 F.3d 833, 836-37 (10th Cir. 2008). In <em>Rhodes, </em>we noted that <em>\u201cBooker </em>made no alteration to \u00a7 3582(c)(2), which, as noted, provides the statutory basis for sentence modification proceedings.... Moreover, the Sixth Amendment concerns that gave rise to the <em>Booker </em>decision will not be replicated in sentence modification proceedings.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at *6. Accordingly, <em>\u201cBooker </em>simply has no bearing on sentencing modification proceedings conducted under \u00a7 3582(c)(2).\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b446-8\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b446-9\">For the foregoing reasons, the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying Mr. Hamilton\u2019s \u00a7 3582(c)(2) motion. Accordingly, we AFFIRM.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b445-8\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1. After examining the briefs and the appellate record, this three-judge panel has determined unanimously that oral argument would not be of material assistance in the determination of this appeal. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 34(a); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The case is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b445-18\">. Because Mr. Hamilton is proceeding pro se, we review his pleadings and filings liberally. <em>See Haines v. Kerner, </em>404 U.S. 519, 520-21, 92 S.Ct. 594, 30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972); <em>Howard v. U.S. Bureau of Prisons, </em>487 F.3d 808, 815 (10th Cir.2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
