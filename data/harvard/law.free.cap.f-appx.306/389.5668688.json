The BIA determined that Molina was inadmissible as an arriving alien who had been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1182(a)(2)(A)(i) (2008); 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v) (2006). We have jurisdiction under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\u201cINA\u201d) \u00a7 242, 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252; <em>see, e.g., Camins v. Gonzales, </em>500 F.3d 872, 876 (9th Cir.2007) (exercising jurisdiction under 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252(a)(2)(D)). For the reasons stated below, we deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-15\">This court has found that 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v) may reasonably be applied retroactively. <em>See id. </em>at 880. Molina argues that 8 U.S.C \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v) has an impermissible retroactive effect in his case under <em>Landgraf v. USI Film Products, </em>511 U.S. 244,114 S.Ct. 1483, 128 L.Ed.2d 229 (1994) because at the time of his conviction Molina\u2019s crime would not have rendered him inadmissible after a short trip abroad. Under <em>Landgraf, </em>this court employs a two-step analysis. <em>See Hernandez de Anderson v. Gonzales, </em>497 F.3d 927, 935-36 (9th Cir.2007). First, the court determines whether \u201cCongress has expressly prescribed the statute\u2019s proper reach.\u201d <em>Landgraf, </em>511 U.S. at 280, 114 S.Ct. 1483. If not, the court must then examine the statute to determine if its application impermissibly \u201cimpose[s] some burden on the basis of an act or event preceding the statute\u2019s enactment.\u201d <em>Fernandez-Vargas v. Gonzales, </em>548 U.S. 30, 37, 126 S.Ct. 2422, 165 L.Ed.2d 323 (2006). The attachment of new legal consequences to past actions is impermissible when it conflicts with \u201cfamiliar considerations of fair notice, reasonable reliance, and settled expectations.\u201d <em>Landgraf, </em>511 U.S. at 270, 114 S.Ct. 1483.</p>\n<p id=\"b413-16\">In <em>Camins, </em>this court found that Congress did not clearly indicate its intent to apply 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v) to prior conduct. <em>Camins, </em>500 F.3d at 882. <em>Camins </em>also found that the retroactive application of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v) undoubtedly attached new legal consequences to past actions. <em>Id. </em>The question <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"392\">*392</page-number>before us, then, is whether in Molina\u2019s case the retroactive application of 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(13)(C)(v) conflicts with any reasonable reliance interest Molina may have had in the state of the law at the time of his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-4\">To determine whether there is a conflict with a protected reliance interest, \u201cwe require that reliance on the prior law \u201cwould have been objectively reasonable under the party\u2019s circumstances.\u2019 \u201d <em>Id. </em>at 884 (citing <em>Hernandez, </em>497 F.3d at 941). Following the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in <em>I.N.S. v. St. Cyr, </em>533 U.S. 289, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001), we have generally found objectively reasonable reliance when a party pled guilty to a crime as part of a <em>quid pro quo </em>agreement with the government. <em>See Saravia-Paguada v. Gonzales, </em>488 F.3d 1122, 1130-31 (9th Cir.2007). Outside of the context of a guilty plea, we have also found reasonable reliance where a party acted affirmatively to apply for naturalization under the assumption that suspension from deportation would be available. <em>See Hernandez, </em>497 F.3d at 942-43.</p>\n<p id=\"b414-5\">However, we require that \u201can alien must demonstrate some affirmative reliance on a previously available immigration benefit to show impermissible retroactivity.\u201d <em>Saravia-Paguada, </em>488 F.3d at 1134. By simply going to trial, Molina showed no affirmative reliance on the state of the law at the time. Nor do any of Molina\u2019s subsequent actions indicate the kind of affirmative post-conviction reliance we found in <em>Hernandez.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b414-6\">Molina also contends that the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigration Responsibility Act section 304(b)\u2019s elimination of the former INA section 212(c) waiver from excludability was impermissibly retroactive in his case. His argument fails here for the same reason as above. In both <em>St. Cyr </em>and <em>Hernandez, </em>the petitioners relied directly on the existence of relief from deportation in making their decisions to plead guilty or to apply for naturalization respectively. Molina did not rely upon the existence of the 212(c) waiver, but rather passively relied upon the fact that conviction for his crime did not result in deportation at the time. Because he took no affirmative action that \u201cenhanced [the] significance [of section 212(c) ] to him in particular,\u201d he cannot claim to have reasonably relied on it. <em>See Saravia-Paguada, </em>488 F.3d at 1134 (citing <em>Fernandez-Vargas, </em>548 U.S. at 44 n. 10, 126 S.Ct. 2422).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-8\">Molina\u2019s final argument is that the elimination of section 212(c) relief violates his Equal Protection rights because the law denies non-citizens who went to trial the opportunity to apply for section 212(c) relief \u2014 even though there were no immigration consequences to their conviction at the time they chose to go to trial \u2014 while allowing non-citizens who pled guilty to the same offenses at the same time to apply for section 212(c) relief. However, as this court has recently stated, \u201cCongress has particularly broad and sweeping powers when it comes to immigration ... Our task, therefore, is to determine, not whether the statutory scheme makes sense to us, but whether we can conceive of a rational reason Congress may have had in adopting it.\u201d <em>Abebe v. Mukasey, </em>554 F.3d 1203, 1206 (9th Cir.2009) (en banc). A legislative classification must be \u201cwholly irrational\u201d to violate Equal Protection. <em>Mathews v. Diaz, </em>426 U.S. 67, 83, 96 S.Ct. 1883, 48 L.Ed.2d 478 (1976).</p>\n<p id=\"b414-9\">That is not the case here. Congress could rationally have concluded that it would be unfair to eliminate a particular form of relief from removal for aliens who could demonstrate an objective measure of past reliance \u2014 such as a guilty plea \u2014 on the previously available relief. Congress might also rationally conclude that honor<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"393\">*393</page-number>ing such past reliance could encourage future plea bargain agreements. Either way, Congress\u2019s distinction was not sufficiently irrational to violate Equal Protection in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b415-5\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b413-17\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
