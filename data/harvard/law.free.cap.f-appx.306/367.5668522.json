Our jurisdiction is governed by 8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1252. We review for substantial evidence adverse credibility findings, <em>Kaur v. Gonzales, </em>418 F.3d 1061, 1064 (9th Cir.2005), and we deny in part and dismiss in part the petition for review.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-4\">The BIA denied Yu\u2019s asylum application as time-barred. Yu does not challenge this finding.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-5\">Substantial evidence supports the agency\u2019s adverse credibility determination based on the demeanor finding as well as discrepancies regarding Yu\u2019s entry into the United States and the date of his detention in China, because the repeated and significant inconsistencies in Yu\u2019s testimony deprive his claim of the requisite \u201cring of truth\u201d. <em>See id. </em>at 1067; <em>Don v. Gonzales, </em>476 F.3d 738, 741-42, 743-44 (9th Cir.2007) (upholding an adverse credibility determination where petitioner demonstrated a lack of consistency about an important date and a propensity for dishonesty); <em>Singh-Kaur v. INS, </em>183 F.3d 1147, 1151 (9th Cir.1999) (demeanor-based adverse credibility determinations are entitled to \u201cspecial deference\u201d). Accordingly, Yu\u2019s withholding of removal claim fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b390-6\">Substantial evidence also supports the agency\u2019s denial of Yu\u2019s CAT claim because this claim is based on the same statements that the agency found to be not credible, and Yu points to no other evidence showing he will more likely than not be tortured. <em>See Farah v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 1153,1157 (9th Cir.2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-7\">We lack jurisdiction to consider Yu\u2019s contention regarding the adequacy of the notice prior to the agency\u2019s frivolous application finding because he did not raise this contention to the BIA. <em>See Ahir v. Mukasey, </em>527 F.3d 912, 917 (9th Cir.2008); <em>Barron v. Ashcroft, </em>358 F.3d 674, 678 (9th Cir.2004).</p>\n<p id=\"b390-11\">PETITION FOR REVIEW DENIED in part; DISMISSED in part.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b389-25\"> This disposition is not appropriate for publication and is not precedent except as provided by 9th Cir.
