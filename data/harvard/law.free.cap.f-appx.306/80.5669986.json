Burgess argues that the district court abused its discretion when it denied his motion to withdraw his guilty plea and failed to hold an evidentiary hearing.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-8\">In determining whether a district court has abused its discretion in denying a motion withdraw a guilty plea, this court considers a number of factors, including assertions of innocence, delay in moving to withdraw, the availability of close assistance of counsel, and the voluntariness of the plea. <em>See United States v. Carr, </em>740 F.2d 339, 343-44 (5th Cir.1984).</p>\n<p id=\"b103-9\">Burgess argues that, because his attorney severely underestimated his likely sentence, his guilty plea was involuntary and he was denied the close assistance of counsel. Burgess\u2019s contentions are belied by his \u201csolemn declarations in open court\u201d that he understood his maximum possible sentence and that he should not rely on any promises of a particular sentence. <em>Blackledge v. Allison, </em>431 U.S. 63, 74, 97 S.Ct. 1621, 52 L.Ed.2d 136 (1977); <em>see James v. Cain, </em>56 F.3d 662, 666 (5th Cir. 1995). Burgess also has not shown that his substantial delay in moving to withdraw his plea and his unsupported assertion of innocence weigh in favor of allowing withdrawal. <em>See </em>Carr, 740 F.2d at 344-45.</p>\n<p id=\"b103-10\">Burgess has not established that the district court abused its discretion in denying his motion to withdraw. <em>See United States v. Powell, </em>354 F.3d 362, 370 (5th Cir.2003). Because Burgess has not \u201calleged] sufficient facts which, if proven, would justify relief,\u201d the district court also did not abuse its discretion in failing to hold an evidentiary hearing on Burgess\u2019s motion to withdraw his plea. <em>See id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b103-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b103-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
