We conclude that Feurtado\u2019s notice of appeal is untimely. A notice of appeal in a criminal case must be filed within ten days of the entry of judgment being appealed. Fed. R. App. P. 4(b)(1). The district court, upon a finding of excusable neglect or good cause, may extend the time period for filing a notice of appeal an additional thirty days. Fed. R. App. P. 4(b)(4). The appeal periods established by Rule 4 are mandatory and jurisdictional. <em>Browder v. Dir., Dep\u2019t of Corr., </em>434 U.S. 257, 264, 98 S.Ct. 556, 54 L.Ed.2d 521 (1978); <em>United States v. Raynor, </em>939 F.2d 191, 197 (4th Cir. 1991). Feurtado\u2019s amended criminal judgment, correcting a clerical error under Fed. R. Crim. P. 36, was entered on December 12, 2007. He did not file a notice of appeal until, at the earliest, March 18, 2008, outside both the ten-day appeal and thirty-day excusable neglect periods. Thus, Feurtado\u2019s appeal is untimely. Accordingly, we dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction and deny as moot Feurtado\u2019s numerous pending motions.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-24\">We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the court and argument would not aid the decisional process.</p>\n<p id=\"b831-25\">\n<em>DISMISSED.</em>\n</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
