We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-21\">I</p>\n<p id=\"Ay\">On August 12, 2003, Dr. Bell performed surgery on Denise Versoy to remove a mass on her right kidney. However, instead of removing the mass, Bell removed <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>Versoy\u2019s entire kidney and did not perform a biopsy to determine if the mass was malignant. On August 9, 2004, Versoy sent a request for review of her medical malpractice claim to the Louisiana Patients\u2019 Compensation Fund (PCF). On August 24, the PCF notified Versoy that within forty-five days she needed to pay a $100 filing fee or obtain a fee waiver. Versoy neither paid the fee nor obtained a waiver.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">On September 27, 2004, Versoy filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection. She then wrote the PCF on October 18 to request dismissal of her proceeding with prejudice. The PCF notified Versoy on November 4, 2004, that because she failed to pay the filing fee, her claim was no longer under consideration.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">On February 17, 2005, Adler \u2014 the bankruptcy trustee \u2014 brought this action and paid the filing fee on Versoy\u2019s behalf. The district court granted Bell\u2019s motion to dismiss, holding that the one-year period applicable to Versoy\u2019s claim prescribed before Versoy filed for bankruptcy protection. Adler timely appealed.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">Because the district court relied upon discovery, its order must be construed as a grant of summary judgment.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> We review a grant or denial of summary judgment de novo, applying the same standard as the district court.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> Summary judgment is appropriate if \u201cthe pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> \u201cAny reasonable inferences are to be drawn in favor of the non-moving party.\u201d<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b89-11\">II</p>\n<p id=\"A8\">A</p>\n<p id=\"Ar-\">Adler claims the district court erred in concluding that Versoy\u2019s claim against Bell prescribed before Versoy filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Under Louisiana law, a medical malpractice action prescribes one year from the date the negligence occurred or one year from the date the plaintiff learned of the negligence.<footnotemark>5</footnotemark> As a prerequisite to filing a medical malpractice claim in court, Louisiana law requires a prospective plaintiff to file an administrative request for review with the PCF.<footnotemark>6</footnotemark> Such a request, if properly filed, tolls the one-year statute of limitations.<footnotemark>7</footnotemark> For a request to be properly filed, the plaintiff must either pay a $100 filing fee or obtain a fee waiver, by providing a physician\u2019s affidavit that states that the claim has merit or obtaining an <em>in forma pauperis </em>ruling.<footnotemark>8</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b89-14\">The district court found that Versoy learned of her claim no later than August 28, 2003; thus, her prescriptive period expired on August 28, 2004, unless the period was tolled. Versoy requested a medical review panel on August 9, 2004. The PCF <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>mailed its confirmation on August 24, 2004, giving Versoy an additional forty-five days \u2014 that is, until October 8, 2004 \u2014 to pay the filing fee.<footnotemark>9</footnotemark> She did not, however, pay her filing fee or submit a physician\u2019s affidavit or <em>in forma pauperis </em>ruling. Thus, the prescriptive period was never tolled.<footnotemark>10</footnotemark> Because the claim prescribed, the district court properly dismissed it against all parties.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">B</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">Adler also claims that 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 108(a) extends the prescriptive period by more than two years and thereby enables him to pay the fee after the payment period otherwise would have elapsed.<footnotemark>11</footnotemark> However, \u00a7 108(a) only applies if the prescriptive period \u201chas not expired before the date of the filing of the petition.\u201d<footnotemark>12</footnotemark> Because Versoy never paid her fee or complied with an exception, the one-year prescriptive period was never tolled. Versoy\u2019s prescriptive period had expired on August 28, 2004, prior to Versoy filing her bankruptcy petition on September 27, 2004; thus, \u00a7 108(a) does not apply.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-6\">To the extent that Adler claims \u00a7 108(a) tolls the forty-five-day filing period, this claim also fails. Section 108(a) only extends the time to commence an \u201caction.\u201d In <em>Ramming v. United States, </em>we held that \u201cthe filing of an administrative claim does not constitute the commencement of an \u2018action\u2019 under \u00a7 108(a)\u201d because the \u201cterm \u2018commencement of an action\u2019 in \u00a7 108(a) applies only to \u2018the bringing of suit in court\u2019 and not to administrative proceedings that may precede such a suit.\u201d<footnotemark>13</footnotemark> The forty-five-day filing period only applies to the administrative request, and therefore \u00a7 108(a) cannot suspend it.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-11\">Ill</p>\n<p id=\"AVI\">Adler further contends that the district court erred in failing to conclude that the PCF\u2019s November 4, 2004 notice explaining that it was no longer considering Versoy\u2019s claim violated the automatic stay. He contends that when Versoy filed for bankruptcy, her interest in the claim against Bell became property of the bankruptcy estate under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-13\">By the terms of 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 362(a), the automatic stay only applies to proceedings \u201cagainst the debtor.\u201d This court determines whether a proceeding is \u201cagainst the debtor\u201d by \u201cexamining] the posture of the case at the initial proceeding.\u201d <footnotemark><em>14</em></footnotemark><em> </em>If the debtor brings the initial claim, \u00a7 362 has <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>no effect.<footnotemark>15</footnotemark> Because Versoy filed the request for review, the proceeding is not \u201cagainst the debtor,\u201d and the stay does not prevent dismissal.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-5\">Moreover, the challenged notice has no legal effect. Louisiana law provides that \u201c[flailure to comply with the [filing] provisions ... <em>shall render the request for review of a malpractice claim invalid and without </em>effect.\u201d<footnotemark>16</footnotemark> The claim is invalid as a matter of law, regardless of whether the PCF sent notification of that fact. Therefore, the district court did not err in failing to find that the PCF\u2019s letter violated the automatic stay.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-6\">IV</p>\n<p id=\"b91-7\">Adler further argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment because a fact issue exists as to whether Versoy dismissed her claims against Bell during the forty-five-day filing period. According to Adler, such an \u201cassignment\u201d would be an avoidable preferential transfer under 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 547.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-8\">The district court did not err. Versoy\u2019s claim prescribed before Versoy sent the notice purporting to dismiss Bell. Because the claims no longer existed, the letter could not assign or transfer any interest to Bell.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-9\">V</p>\n<p id=\"Ahb\">Finally, Adler contends that the district court erroneously relied upon Louisiana Revised Statutes \u00a7 40:1299.39.1, which applies only to medical malpractice claims against the state, rather than Louisiana Revised Statutes \u00a7 40:1299.47, which applies to claims against private health care providers. According to Adler, \u00a7 40:1299.47 allows an applicant to obtain a fee waiver by filing an <em>informa pauperis </em>ruling, while \u00a7 40:1299.39.1 does not. However, both statutes contain identical provisions waiving the filing requirement for claimants who obtain an <em>informa pauperis </em>ruling.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-13\">The district court explicitly considered this provision in its opinion, stating that Versoy \u201cwas required to pay a $100.00 filing fee within 45 days, or provide a physician\u2019s affidavit or <em>in forma pauperis </em>ruling to obtain a waiver of the fee.\u201d Versoy did not comply with the requirements of these identical provisions. Thus, the district court\u2019s citation to \u00a7 40:1299.39.1 is harmless error.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-14\">* * *</p>\n<p id=\"b91-15\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b88-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
