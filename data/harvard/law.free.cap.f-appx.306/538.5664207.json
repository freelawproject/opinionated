Mastantuono appeals his 60-month sentence, which was imposed after he pleaded guilty to five counts of uttering and possessing forged securities in violation of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 513(a). Mastantuono\u2019s sentencing guidelines range was 15 to 21 months, and he contends that his 60-month sentence was unreasonable. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-23\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-24\">Mastantuono was a mortgage broker in Augusta, Georgia. In May 2002, he forged a client\u2019s signature and deposited five of her checks, totaling over $11,000, into his own account. Those five checks became the bases for a five-count information against Mastantuono. He pleaded guilty.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-25\">At his sentencing, Mastantuono did not make any objections to the Presentence Investigation Report (PSI), and the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"539\">*539</page-number>trict court adopted the PSI as its factual findings. <em>See United States v. Wade, </em>458 F.3d 1273, 1277 (11th Cir.2006) (\u201cIt is the law of this circuit that a failure to object to allegations of fact in a PSI admits those facts for sentencing purposes.\u201d). The PSI stated that Mastantuono had been previously convicted of four theft charges and four other charges based on writing bad checks. The PSI also described how, while his current criminal charges were pending, Mastantuono had befriended 95-year old widow Martha Beattie and removed more than $200,000 from her bank accounts, though the extent of that fraud remains unclear.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">The district court noted that Mastantuono\u2019s base guidelines range was 15 to 21 months\u2019 imprisonment, based on his offense level of 12 and his criminal history category of III. The district court also noted that the statutory maximum sentence under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 513(a) was ten years\u2019 imprisonment. After considering the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, the district court sentenced Mastantuono to 60 months\u2019 imprisonment on each of the five counts, to run concurrently. Mastantuono appeals his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-6\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-7\">When a sentence is based a variance from the guidelines under \u00a7 3553(a)<footnotemark>1</footnotemark>, we review it for reasonableness, which equates to abuse of discretion review. <em>United States v. Booker, </em>543 U.S. 220, 261, 125 S.Ct. 738, 765, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). A defendant who challenges his sentence bears the burden of establishing that the sentence is unreasonable. <em>United States v. Talley, </em>431 F.3d 784, 785, 788 (11th Cir.2005). Our reasonableness inquiry has two parts.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-10\">First, we must ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error. Possible procedural errors include \u201cfailing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence \u2014 including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.\u201d <em>Gall v. United States, </em>552 U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). In stating its reasons for a variance, a district court need not discuss or explain how it has considered each of the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. <em>Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786. Instead, \u201can acknowledgment by the district court that it has considered the defendant\u2019s arguments and the factors in section 3553(a) is sufficient.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b561-13\">Mastantuono concedes that the district court\u2019s sentencing process was \u201cprocedurally sound.\u201d Even if Mastantuono had not admitted it, the district court\u2019s reference to \u00a7 3553(a) was clearly sufficient. The district court reviewed the evidence and arguments presented by both parties, considered the guidelines, and examined the \u00a7 3553(a) factors. The court stated:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b562-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>It is my conclusion that a guideline sentence \u2014 in this case, fifteen to twenty-one months imprisonment \u2014 would, contrary to what my friend, Mr. Hawk [defense counsel], says, be perceived, in my estimation, as laughable by the public. The elements of Title 18, United States Code, Section 3558(a) provide that the Court should sentence [a] defendant ... to achieve all of the objectives and elements enumerated in 3553(a)....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b562-4\"><em>See also Talley, </em>431 F.3d at 786; <em>United States v. Scott, </em>426 F.3d 1324, 1329 (11th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Robles, </em>408 F.3d 1324, 1328 (11th Cir.2005) (noting that after <em>Booker, </em>district courts need not explain every \u00a7 3553(a) factor and expound on how each factor played a role in the sentencing decision).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">Second, having determined that the district court made no procedural error, we must consider whether Mastantuono\u2019s sentence is substantively reasonable, taking into account the totality of the circumstances. <em>Gall, </em>552 U.S. at-, 128 S.Ct. at 597; <em>United States v. Pugh, </em>515 F.3d 1179, 1190 (11th Cir.2008). We \u201cmust give due deference to the district court\u2019s decision that the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.\u201d <em>Pugh, </em>515 F.3d at 1191 (quotations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-7\">\u201cIn determining whether a sentence is reasonable, we are guided by the factors as set forth in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).\u201d <em>United States v. Valnor, </em>451 F.3d 744, 750-51 (11th Cir.2006). The \u00a7 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with educational or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the sentencing guidelines range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to avoid unwanted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3553(a).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-9\">Mastantuono contends that the district court acted unreasonably in sentencing him to 60 months\u2019 imprisonment, almost triple' the top end of the guideline range that applies to his case. Mastantuono argues that his behavior falls within the heartland of the conduct envisioned by the sentencing guidelines, and notes that his forged securities involved less than $12,000. Mastantuono also argues that, based on his criminal history category of III, he would have had to steal more than $400,000 to be subject to 60 months\u2019 imprisonment under the guidelines.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-10\">However, Mastantuono has failed to show that his 60-month sentence is substantively unreasonable. Mastantuono\u2019s background shows a long history of thievery and writing bad checks. Further, the clients from whom Mastantuono stole $11,000 testified that they remain in dire financial straits several years after their loss. Perhaps most importantly, Mastantuono continued his errant ways even after being investigated and charged in the present case. Though the details are not clear, it appears that Mastantuono befriended a 95-year old widow, diverted her mail, and drained her bank accounts of more than $200,000.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-11\">All of these considerations fit into the \u00a7 3553(a) factors: the circumstances of the offense were such that Mastantuono\u2019s crime caused more harm to his victims than some thefts of $11,000 might; his history of thievery and writing bad checks and his brazenness in stealing from an elderly widow even while his criminal charges were pending suggests that protecting the public, deterring crime, pro<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>moting respect for the law, and providing just punishment \u2014 all \u00a7 3553(a) factors\u2014 were reasonably served by varying Mastantuono\u2019s sentence upward.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">Finally, Mastantuono\u2019s 60-month sentence is significantly less than the statutory maximum of ten years for each count under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 513(a). Since Mastantuono pleaded guilty to five counts, his total maximum sentence was 50 years. <em>See Valnor, </em>451 F.3d at 751-52 (considering a statutory maximum of fifteen years in finding a twenty-eight month sentence reasonable); <em>United States v. Winingear, </em>422 F.3d 1241, 1245-46 (11th Cir.2005) (considering a statutory maximum of twenty years in finding a two-year sentence for mail fraud reasonable).</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">Mastantuono\u2019s sentence was both procedurally sound and substantively reasonable. Accordingly, we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b561-8\">. Mastantuono suggests that his sentence was based on an \u201cupward departure\u201d instead of a \u201cvariance.\u201d Although the probation officer did present evidence supporting an upward departure under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3 or \u00a7 5K2.21, the district court made it quite clear that the sentence was based on a \u00a7 3553(a) variance. During the sentencing hearing, the district court interrupted counsel to clarify that exact point. The court said. \"Actually, it's a variance; is it not, Mr. Dallas [probation officer]?\" The officer responded, \"Yes, Your Honor,\u201d and the district court then said, \"Not a departure, but a variance. 1 should have been more specific about that. Go ahead.\u201d <em>See also United States v. Eldick, </em>443 F.3d 783, 788 n. 2 (11th Cir.2006) (describing the difference between a variance and an upward departure).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
