On appeal, Republic raises two arguments. First, Republic contends that the District Court erred in concluding that plaintiff Charles M. Hallman\u2019s (\u201cHallman\u201d) suit was not barred by <em>res judicata. </em>According to Republic, Hallman was in privity, as New York law defines that term,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> with cross-defendant-appellee Benefits Express, LLC (\u201cBenefits\u201d) in an arbitration proceeding between Republic and Benefits that pre-dated Hallman\u2019s action against Republic. Second, Republic argues that the District Court erred in failing to deduct a portion of the jury\u2019s award to Hallinan. The District Court deducted $57,854.69 as an impermissible award of litigation costs; Republic maintains that an additional $38,840.76 must be deducted for the same reason. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history of this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b648-21\">We review <em>de novo </em>a district court\u2019s denial of a motion for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50(b) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. <em>See, e.g., Nat\u2019l Commc\u2019n Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. AT &amp; T Corp., </em>238 F.3d 124,127 (2d Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"627\">*627</page-number>Like the District Court, we hold that (1) Hallinan\u2019s suit was not barred, as a matter of law, by <em>res judicata, see Green v. Santa Fe Indus., Inc., </em>70 N.Y.2d 244, 258, 519 N.Y.S.2d 793, 514 N.E.2d 105, 108 (1987) (noting that a non-party to a prior action is not barred from bringing suit in a subsequent action unless either \u201cthe interests of the non-party can be said to have been represented in the prior proceeding\u201d or the nonparty \u201ccan be said to have controlled the conduct of the prior action to further his own interests\u201d); and (2) further reduction of Hallinan\u2019s award was not warranted, <em>see Ismail v. Cohen, </em>899 F.2d 183, 186 (2d Cir.1990) (\u201cIt is well settled that calculation of damages is the province of the jury.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b649-5\">Accordingly, the September 7, 2007 order of the District Court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b648-17\">. The District Court's jurisdiction was based on diversity of citizenship. <em>See </em>28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332. On appeal, both parties agree that the issue whether plaintiff's suit was barred by <em>res judicata </em>should have been decided under New York law. <em>See Erie R. Co. v. Tompkins, </em>304 U.S. 64, 58 S.Ct. 817, 82 L.Ed. 1188 (1938). As we have previously noted, \u201cthe federal doctrine [of <em>res judicata </em>] uses privity in a way similar to its use under New York law.\u201d <em>Chase Manhattan Bank, N.A. v. Celotex Corp., </em>56 F.3d 343, 346 (2d Cir.1995) (noting that application of either federal or New York definitions of \"privity\u201d would yield the same result in a diversity action).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
