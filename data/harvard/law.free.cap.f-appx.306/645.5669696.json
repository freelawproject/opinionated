Smith appeals from a judgment of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York (Seybert, J.), dismissing his complaint on numerous grounds. The court held, <em>inter alia, </em>that Smith\u2019s claims I \u2014 III were barred by <em>res judicata, </em>and that his claims IV-V were barred by the Tax Injunction Act (\u201cTIA\u201d), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and the procedural history.</p>\n<p id=\"b668-15\">Smith\u2019s initial brief to this Court challenges only the legal standards applied by the district court in assessing the defendant\u2019s motion to dismiss. Smith argues that the district court erred in evaluating the defendant\u2019s motion under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1) by declining to draw all inferences in his favor, and that the district court erred in evaluating the defendant\u2019s motion under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) by invoking the \u201cflexible plausibility standard\u201d set forth in <em>Iqbal v. Hasty, </em>490 F.3d 143, 157-58 (2d Cir.2007) (internal quotation marks omitted), <em>cert, granted sub nom., Ashcroft v. </em>Iqbal,-U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 2931, 171 L.Ed.2d 863 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b668-18\">Smith\u2019s initial brief fails to argue how his complaint would have avoided dismissal under the standards he advocates. Moreover, Smith\u2019s initial brief does not challenge certain rulings by the district court that are dispositive of this appeal and are unaffected by any of the challenged standards. Specifically, Smith does not challenge the district court\u2019s holding that his claims I \u2014 III were barred by <em>res judicata, </em>and (although he mentions the TIA in passing) he does not explain how different <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"647\">*647</page-number>standards would have altered the court\u2019s analysis of the TIA.</p>\n<p id=\"b669-5\">Accordingly, Smith has waived any challenge to the district court\u2019s application of <em>res judicata </em>and the TIA. <em>See </em>Fed. R.App. P. 28(a)(9); <em>LoSacco v. City of Middletown, </em>71 F.3d 88, 92-93 (2d Cir.1995) (holding that an issue is abandoned where not raised in appellate brief); <em>United States v. Joyner, </em>313 F.3d 40, 44 (2d Cir. 2002) (\u201cIt is well established that an argument not raised on appeal is deemed abandoned and lost, and that a court of appeals will not consider the argument unless it has reason to believe that manifest injustice would result otherwise.\u201d (internal quotations omitted)).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-6\">We decline to consider arguments that Smith raises for the first time in the reply brief or at oral argument. <em>See NLRB v. Star Color Plate Serv., </em>843 F.2d 1507, 1510 n. 3 (2d Cir.l988)(appellate court may reject any argument raised for the first time in a reply brief).</p>\n<p id=\"b669-7\">Accordingly, we hereby AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
