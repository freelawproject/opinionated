We have reviewed Judge Diamond\u2019s thoughtful and careful Memorandum, dated January 24, 2008, 2008 WL 219223, in which the district court explains why defendant is entitled to summary judgment and why plaintiff is not. We can add little to the district court\u2019s analysis and will therefore affirm substantially for the reasons set forth in that Memorandum.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
