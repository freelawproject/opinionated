Durham (\u201cDurham\u201d) appeals the district court\u2019s denial of his petition for a writ of habeas\u2019 corpus filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. The crux of Durham\u2019s claim is that the United States Parole Commission (\u201cthe Commission\u201d) erred in calculating the amount of time remaining on his 1983 bank-robbery conviction in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky. We disagree, and we therefore AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-7\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b248-8\">The tale of Durham\u2019s criminal history and his involvement in the federal criminal-justice system, both before and after the enactment of the Sentencing Reform Act, is a lengthy one. Fortunately, the parties essentially do not dispute the facts, and the events of only a short period of-time are relevant to Durham\u2019s appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-9\">In 1983, in the Eastern District of Kentucky, Durham was charged with and convicted of committing an armed bank robbery. Joint Appendix (\u201cJ.A.\u201d) at 82, 94.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> On December 2, 1983, Durham was sentenced to twenty years of imprisonment, but his term was later reduced to nineteen years after an appeal. J.A. at 94, 96. Durham spent the remainder of the 1980s bouncing back and forth between federal custody and parole.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-12\">On January 22, 1992, Durham was released on parole supervision until the expiration of his bank-robbery sentence on September 22, 2002. J.A. at 101; Resp\u2019t Br. at 3. Durham again violated his parole, and on August 23, 1994, the Commission revoked his parole, credited him with time spent on parole, and set a presumptive parole date of November 25, 1996. JA. at 102; Resp\u2019t Br. at 4.</p>\n<p id=\"b248-13\">On November 22, 1996, just three days before his presumptive date of parole, Durham escaped from a halfway house. J.A. at 104; Resp\u2019t Br. at 4. Durham, spent 107 days out of federal custody, returning to federal custody on March 9, 1997. Durham\u2019s escape led, eventually, to two new federal convictions, both of which were to run <em>consecutive </em>to his old, 1983 bank-robbery conviction. First, on the charge of escape, he received a thirty-three-month sentence in the Eastern District of Kentucky on October 30, 1997. J.A. at 89. Second, on February 24, 1999, Durham received an eight-month sentence in the Southern District of Indiana on a charge of resisting, opposing, impeding, intimidating/interfering with a law enforcement officer. J.A. at 89-90. Durham committed this offense on February 26, 1997, in the period after he had escaped from the halfway house and before he returned to federal custody on March 9, 1997. Durham then spent the entire period of March 9, 1997, to March 2, 2000, in federal custody. That nearly thirty-six-month period was credited toward, and fully served, his sentences of imprisonment for two new federal convictions.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>In its filing in the district court in response to Durham\u2019s habeas petition, the Commission acknowledged losing track of Durham around the time of his escape, apparently not learning until January 1998 that Durham had returned to federal custody. J.A. at 64. As a result, the Commission held a rescission hearing in June 1998. J.A. at 105. The hearing examiner noted that Durham had escaped three days prior to his presumptive date of parole and that he was currently then serving a thirty-three-month sentence for his escape. J.A. at 106. The examiner recommended \u201c[r]escind[ing] the effective date of [parole of] 11/25/96 to reparole effective 3/12/97, Nunc Pro Tunc, to the federal detainer only [Durham\u2019s new escape sentence].\u201d<footnotemark>2</footnotemark> J.A. at 107. The reasoning essentially seemed to be that because Durham escaped before serving the final three days before his presumptive parole date, the first three days of his return to federal custody would count toward that obligation and he would not start receiving credit toward his new federal sentence until his third day back in federal custody, March 12,1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-5\">The Commission agreed with the examiner\u2019s recommendation and, on June 29, 1998, issued a Notice of Action rescinding Durham\u2019s \u201cparole effective date of 11-25-1996\u201d and reparoling him \u201ceffective on 03-12-1997 <em>nunc pro tunc </em>to the federal detainer only.\u201d J.A. at 108. The 107 days that Durham spent on escape status would not be credited toward any sentence, <em>id., </em>and based on the Commission\u2019s decision, the Bureau of Prisons (\u201cBOP\u201d) thus extended the expiration of the sentence for Durham\u2019s bank-robbery conviction from September 2002 to a new expiration date of January 7, 2003, J.A. at 93; Resp\u2019t Br. at 5.</p>\n<p id=\"b249-9\">On July 20, 1998, the Commission issued a parole certificate granting Durham parole, <em>nunc pro tunc, </em>to March 12, 1997; the certificate stated that his bank-robbery sentence would expire on January 7, 2003. J.A. at 110; Resp\u2019t Br. at 5-6. Durham did not sign the certificate until September 4,1998.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b249-10\">On March 2, 2000, Durham was released from federal custody, having fully served his new federal sentences of imprisonment thanks to the <em>nunc pro tunc </em>parole device that permitted him to begin service of his new federal sentences on March 12, 1997. It appears that Durham was arrested again on October 30, 2000, and returned to custody. J.A. 133. On June 26, 2002, the Commission conducted a revocation hearing concerning Durham\u2019s parole violations that occurred between March 2000 and October 2000. J.A. at 130-34. The hearing examiner determined that Durham \u201cwas arrested on 10/30/2000 and has been in custody since that time.\u201d J.A. at 133. During a portion of that period in custody \u2014 from August 22, 2001, to November 29, 2001 \u2014 Durham was in custody specifically on a Commission warrant for a parole violation. J.A. at 113, 116; Resp\u2019t Br. at 6-7. The hearing examiner recommended <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"228\">*228</page-number>revoking Durham\u2019s parole and <em>also </em>recommended that \u201c[n]one of the time spent on parole shall be credited.\u201d J.A. at 133. Although Durham had only been released from federal custody on March 2, 2000, because of the Commission\u2019s <em>nunc pro tunc </em>Parole Certificate, Durham had technic\u00e1lly been \u201con parole\u201d since March 12, 1997. J.A. at 126 (April 1, 2002, Warrant Application) (stating Durham was \u201cReleased\u201d on \u201cMarch 12, 1997\u201d). Therefore, on July 2, 2002, when the Commission concurred with the examiner\u2019s recommendation and issued a decision revoking Durham\u2019s parole and finding that \u201c[n]one of the time spent on parole shall be credited,\u201d J.A. at 135, the period of uncredited, or forfeited, time extended all the way back to March 12, 1997. <em>See also </em>Resp\u2019t Br. at 8 (stating that the Commission\u2019s decision meant that Durham \u201cforfeit[ed] all of the time spent on parole\u201d). The Commission did credit Durham with the \u201c[t]ime. spent in confinement from 09-04-2001 to 11-29-2001 ... toward service of the maximum sentence.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b250-4\">Durham appealed the Commission\u2019s action to the National Appeals Board (\u201cNAB\u201d), J.A. at 138-45 (Appeal), which affirmed the Commission\u2019s decision. J.A. at 146. It rejected Durham\u2019s contention that \u201cyou were not paroled on March 12, 1997 because you refused to sign your parole certificate,\u201d noting that \u201c[y]ou signed the certificate on September 4,1998 stating that you fully understood your conditions of parole.\u201d <em>Id. </em>The NAB also clarified that Durham should receive custody credit for the period between August 22, 2001, and November 29, 2001, when his custody was due to a Commission warrant (the Commission had credited Durham only with the time between September 4, 2001, and November 29, 2001). <em>Id.; see also </em>J.A. at 135. As a result of the Commission and the NAB\u2019s actions, \u201cthe BOP calculated the expiration of Durham\u2019s [1983 bank robbery] sentence as November 17, 2007.\u201d Resp\u2019t Br. at 9 (citing J.A. at 85). The new calculation thus extended the expiration date of Durham\u2019s 1983 sentence by nearly five years-from January 7, 2003, to November 17, 2007. That period corresponds to the amount of time \u201con parole\u201d that the Commission declared \u201cnot credited,\u201d or forfeited, which in Durham\u2019s case became, on account of the \u201cnunc pro tunc\u201d parole certificate that he signed in September 1998, the more than five-year period between March 12, 1997, and May 1, 2002, when he was arrested on the warrant for his parole violation (minus the roughly three-month period in late 2001 that the Commission did credit).</p>\n<p id=\"b250-6\">On December 30, 2002, Durham was released on parole and signed a parole certificate. The certificate stated an expiration date of November 17, 2007, for the nineteen-year sentence for bank robbery that he received in 1983, and below his signature, Durham wrote that he \u201c[s]igned in protest of date.\u201d J.A. at 147.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-7\">Durham has continued to circulate in and out of custody, and according to the Respondent\u2019s Brief he is next eligible for parole on February 27, 2009, and as of November 26, 2007, the expiration date for Durham\u2019s 1983 sentence is January 15, 2012. Resp\u2019t Br. at 10; J.A. at 177.</p>\n<p id=\"b250-8\">On July 26, 2006, Durham filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241. J.A. at 8-15. Durham essentially contested the manner in which the Commission extended his sentence based on the forfeited parole time, arguing that \u201cthe Parole Commission acted improperly on July 20, 1998, in entering an order \u2018nunc pro tunc\u2019 restoring Durham to parole during the time when he was serving his federal sentence in federal custody.\u201d J.A. at 14 (Pet. at 7). Durham argued the effect was to \u201cimproperly ex<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"229\">*229</page-number>tend[ ] his sentence past his expiration full term date.\u201d <em>Id. </em>Durham noted that, pursuant to regulation, \u201c[a] grant of parole shall not be deemed to be operative until a certificate of parole has been delivered to the prisoner.\u201d 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.29(a); J.A. at 14 (Pet. at 7) (citing regulation). Durham therefore argued that \u201c[c]ontrary to the claim of the Parole Commission, [parole] did not become effective until September 4, 1998. At the bottom of the \u2018nunc pro tunc\u2019 order is the following sentence: \u2018The above-named person was released on the 12th day of March 1997 with a total of 2,127 days remaining to be served.\u2019 This computation theory was without foundation.\u201d J.A. at 14 (Pet. at 7). Durham therefore requested \u201ca hearing to take evidence to establish when Durham completed his sentence as the records of the Parole Commission are fraught with error.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b251-5\">On November 3, 2006, the Commission filed an answer to his petition. J.A. at 62-77. The Commission argued that \u201c [because [Durham\u2019s] parole was revoked [in 2002], in part for conviction of a crime that he committed while on parole which was punishable by a term of imprisonment, he must forfeit all of the time spent on parole following his parole grant on March 12, 1997 until his return to federal custody.\u201d J.A. at 70 (Answer at 9). The Commission also noted that Durham\u2019s conviction in Indiana state court, for conduct that occurred between March 2000 and October 2000, \u201cwas the basis for forfeiture of all of the time [Durham] spent on parole, which extended the expiration date of his sentence from January 7, 2003 to November 17, 2007. Therefore, the Commission properly forfeited [Durham\u2019s] street time when it revoked his parole in 2002.\u201d J.A. at 73.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-6\">On March 28, 2007, the district court denied Durham\u2019s petition. J.A. at 37-53. The district court held that Durham waived his challenge to the September 1998 parole certificate because he signed it, J.A. at 48, and continued to consider his petition on the merits but denied relief because it found the use of the <em>nunc pro tunc </em>certificate acceptable, citing an unpublished order in a Sixth Circuit case, <em>Milton-Vales v. LaManna, </em>2 FedAppx. 480 (6th Cir.2001); J.A. at 49. The district court held that it \u201cagree[d] with the USPC that its <em>nunc pro tunc </em>order should have the same retroactive effect of making [Durham\u2019s] parole effective as if entered on the earlier date.\u201d J.A. at 53.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-8\">Durham\u2019s counsel filed a notice of appeal, and Durham, acting pro se, filed a separate letter to the district court. J.A. at 57. After oral argument, Durham and the Commission both filed additional letter briefs at the request of the panel.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-9\">We now consider Durham\u2019s appeal, as the district court correctly noted that a certificate of appealability is unnecessary to appeal the denial of a petition for habeas corpus filed under \u00a7 2241. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2253(c)(1); <em>Massey v. Chandler, </em>No. 97-5389, 1998 WL 69109 (6th Cir.1998) (unpublished); J.A. at 156-57.</p>\n<p id=\"b251-10\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n<p id=\"b251-11\">Durham\u2019s appeal involves essentially a single issue: whether the Commission acted improperly in 1998 in issuing Durham a <em>nunc pro tunc </em>certificate of parole that purported to grant him parole as of March 12, 1997. As a preliminary matter, the Commission contends that Durham waived any challenge to the <em>nunc pro tunc </em>certificate of parole by signing the certificate, and we address that issue first. We hold that Durham has not waived his challenge to the Commission\u2019s actions.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"230\">*230</page-number>A. Preservation of the Issue</p>\n<p id=\"b252-4\">The district court \u201cdetermine[d] that [Durham\u2019s] signatures [on the September 1998 and December 2002 certificates] constituted knowing and voluntary agreement with the terms of the Certificates.\u201d J.A. at 48. In support of this determination, the district court cited our unpublished order in <em>Phillips v. United States, </em>No. 95-3823, 1996 WL 185791 (6th Cir.1996). In <em>Phillips, </em>an appeal contesting the denial of a motion filed pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255, we held that a defen-, dant\u2019s signature on a plea agreement, <em>coupled </em>with the advice of her attorney and the trial judge\u2019s careful explanation of the plea agreement and the rights to be waived, sufficed to waive certain rights. <em>Id. </em>at *1. The circumstances in which the' defendant signed the plea agreement in <em>Phillips </em>were manifestly dissimilar to those in which Durham signed the parole certificates, and <em>Phillips </em>does not support the district court\u2019s holding. The district court further cited two opinions in <em>civil </em>cases issued by district courts in our circuit; those cases held that a party waived various rights due to signing a contract. Those cases also obviously do not support the district court\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-5\">The Commission dedicates slightly more than a page of its brief to defending the district court\u2019s determination and cites only <em>Phillips </em>and one additional case, <em>Nagi v. United States, </em>90 F.3d 130 (6th Cir. 1996). Resp\u2019t Br. at 11 (citing <em>Nagi). </em>In <em>Nagi, </em>another appeal of the denial of a \u00a7 2255 motion, we held that a defendant waived an objection to being sentenced according to the 1988 Manual of the United States Sentencing Guidelines, instead of the 1987 version. <em>Id. </em>at 136. Unlike Durham, the defendant in <em>Nagi </em>had the service of counsel and also appeared before a U.S. District Judge for both a plea and a sentencing hearing. Again, we find <em>Nagi </em>easily distinguishable from Durham\u2019s case.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-7\">Based on the record, which consists only of copies of the signed documents, we cannot conclude that Durham waived any challenge to the Commission\u2019s actions and calculation of his sentence. The Supreme Court has long held that \u201cwaiver is ordinarily an intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right or privilege,\u201d <em>Johnson v. Zerbst, </em>304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938), and that \u201c[presuming waiver from a silent record is impermissible,\u201d <em>Camley v. Cochran, </em>369 U.S. 506, 516, 82 S.Ct. 884, 8 L.Ed.2d 70 (1962). The Commission has not advanced sufficient evidence to support the conclusion that Durham\u2019s signature on the parole certificates amounted to voluntarily, knowingly, and intelligently relinquishing his right to challenge the effect those certificates would have on calculating his sentence.</p>\n<p id=\"b252-8\">B. Whether The Commission\u2019s <em>Nunc Pro Tunc </em>Parole Certificate Was Improper</p>\n<p id=\"b252-9\">1. Legal Standards</p>\n<p id=\"b252-10\">\u201cWe review de novo a district court\u2019s denial of a petition for the writ of habeas corpus filed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2241.\u201d <em>Rosales-Garcia v. Holland, </em>322 F.3d 386, 400-01 (6th Cir.2003) (en banc); <em>see also Dietz v. U.S. Parole Comm\u2019n, </em>260 Fed. Appx. 763, 766 (6th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b252-11\">The proper standard of review for evaluating the Commission\u2019s actions in this case is a murkier question, but we conclude that we should review Durham\u2019s claim de novo. In <em>Hackett v. U.S. Parole Comm\u2019n, </em>851 F.2d 127, 129-30 (6th Cir. 1987), we stated that our \u201cscope of review over a decision by the Parole Commission is extremely limited\u201d and quoted approvingly from a Seventh Circuit decision that</p>\n<p id=\"b253-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"231\">*231</page-number>\u201capplied a limited \u2018abuse of discretion\u2019 standard when reviewing decisions of the Parole Commission.\u201d In <em>Hackett, </em>however, the petitioner\u2019s claim was \u201cthat the Commission improperly set the release date outside the range established under the recommended parole guidelines and that the Commission erred by relying on evidence which was not produced at trial and was specifically rejected by the sentencing judge.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 128. Durham\u2019s claim is clearly very different. His claim is that the Commission acted improperly and in violation of a federal regulation by issuing a <em>nunc pro tunc </em>parole certificate and accordingly treating Durham\u2019s date of parole as March 12, 1997, and that doing so increased the amount of time forfeited and extended the expiration date of Durham\u2019s sentence. Durham\u2019s claim essentially raises a question of law \u2014 whether the Commission\u2019s actions complied with relevant federal regulations \u2014 and in similar circumstances our sister circuits have applied a de novo standard of review. <em>See Hutchings v. U.S. Parole Comm\u2019n, </em>201 F.3d 1006, 1008-09 (8th Cir.2000) (\u201cWhether the Commission had jurisdiction to revoke Hutchings\u2019 parole and whether the Commission\u2019s proceedings violated Hutchings\u2019 due process rights are questions of law, and we therefore review de novo.\u201d); <em>Wallace v. Christensen, </em>802 F.2d 1539, 1551, 1552 n. 8 (9th Cir.1986) (en banc) (stating that \u201c[a] claim that the Commission has acted outside its statutory limits typically involves an issue of statutory construction which we review de novo\u201d and that \u201c[t]he Commission, like other agencies, is thus bound by its own regulations so long as they remain in force\u201d). In addition, our unpublished order in <em>Milton-Vales </em>supports reviewing Durham\u2019s claim de novo. In <em>Milton-Vales, </em>the petitioner \u201calleged that the Parole Commission had miscalculated the length of his federal parole-violator sentence and the amount of time that he had served before being paroled.\u201d <em>Milton-Vales, 2 </em>Fed.Appx. at 480. We began our analysis by referring to \u201c[a] <em>de 7iovo </em>review of the record.\u201d <em>Id. </em>In light of all these decisions, we conclude that a de novo standard of review applies to Durham\u2019s claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-6\">2. Analysis</p>\n<p id=\"b253-7\">Although Durham\u2019s briefing is not a model of clarity and seems to espouse a number of theories for relief, we understand the crux of Durham\u2019s complaint to be as follows. Federal regulations provide that parole is not operative until the delivery to the prisoner of a certificate of parole. 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 2.29(a). In Durham\u2019s case, that delivery occurred on September 4,1998. The certificate, however, purported to grant parole <em>nunc pro tunc </em>with an effective date of March 12, 1997, approximately eighteen months earlier. The Commission thus treated Durham as being \u201con parole\u201d from March 12, 1997, even though Durham was in fact in federal custody serving new federal sentences for escape and resisting a law enforcement officer, with his period in custody beginning on March 9, 1997, and extending to March 2,2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b253-8\">In its letter brief, the Commission states that employing the <em>nunc pro tunc </em>parole certificate was necessary for Durham to finish the service of his new federal sentences as soon as possible. The Commission explains that, had the Commission not used the <em>nunc pro tunc </em>parole certificate, Durham \u201cwould have spent additional time in prison\u201d because \u201c[i]f [Durham] had not been paroled until September 4, 1998, [the date of delivery of the parole certificate,] he could not have begun serving his escape sentence until this date.\u201d Comm\u2019n Letter Br. at 2. The Commission states that \u201c[a]s a result, Durham would not have been paroled until August 24, 2001, eighteen <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"232\">*232</page-number>months later than his actual release date\u201d of March 2, 2000.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-4\">Durham accepts this point that the <em>nunc pro tunc </em>parole certif\u00edcate permitted him to expedite service of his new federal sentences and enjoy an earlier release date, stating in his letter brief that \u201che would have been in prison an additional 17 months\u201d but for the use of the <em>nunc pro tunc </em>certificate. Pet\u2019r Letter Br. at 2. But Durham\u2019s letter brief then asserts that we should essentially view the seventeen-month period following his actual release from prison in March 2000 as time spent fulfilling what he claims was the remainder of his new federal sentences. <em>Id. </em>at 2-3. On the basis of that legal fiction, Durham then offers an alternative accounting for the following various periods of time that he spent in and out of custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-5\">In consideration of the fact that both the Commission and Durham understand that the Commission\u2019s use of the <em>nunc pro tunc </em>parole certificate afforded Durham the substantial benefit of expediting the service of his new federal sentences \u2014 as well as essentially providing him the opportunity simultaneously to serve time on parole toward his 1983 bank-robbery conviction\u2014 we decline to find error in the Commission\u2019s actions in this case. Furthermore, we are unable to accept Durham\u2019s argument that we must view the seventeen months following his release in March 2000 as time spent fulfilling his new federal convictions \u201cbecause of the mistake of the Parole Commission\u201d and his further alternative accounting of his time in and out of custody. Pet\u2019r Letter Br. at 3. Although Durham did not waive <em>any </em>challenge to the Commission\u2019s calculation of his sentence by agreeing to and signing the <em>nunc pro tunc </em>parole certificate, this challenge is meritless.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-6\">Accordingly, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment denying Durham\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p id=\"b254-7\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b254-8\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the district court\u2019s judgment denying Durham\u2019s petition for a writ of habeas corpus.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b248-11\">. In fact, Durham\u2019s first encounter with the federal criminal-justice system came even earlier, in 1977, when he was convicted of interstate transportation of motor vehicles and making a false statement in obtaining a firearm. J.A. at 39-40. Durham received an eight-year sentence, and the nineteen-year sentence he received for his 1983 bank robbery conviction was to run concurrently with the sentence for his 1977 offense.
