FDIC, </em>No. DC0752990690-C-1 (M.S.P.B. Apr.4, 2008) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"566\">*566</page-number><em>(\u201c2008 Decision </em>\u201d), <em>review denied, Elliott v. FDIC, </em>No. DC0752990690-C-1, 109 M.S.P.R. 697 (M.S.P.B. Aug. 5, 2008). Because the Board\u2019s decision is supported by substantial evidence and not contrary to law, we <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b588-5\">Elliott worked as a Computer Specialist at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (\u201cFDIC\u201d or \u201cagency\u201d) until his removal on June 18, 1999. He appealed his removal to the Board, which sustained his removal in an initial decision dated November 19, 1999. <em>Elliott v. FDIC, </em>No. DC0752990690-I-1 (M.S.P.B. Nov. 19, 1999) (\u201c1999 <em>Decision </em>\u201d). In reaching that decision, the Board sustained the agency\u2019s charges that Elliott (1) \u201cprovide[d] incorrect and false information with specific intent to defraud the agency\u201d and (2) \u201cengaged in inappropriate or disrespectful conduct.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 7. The initial decision became final on August 18, 2000. Elliott then challenged his removal in several federal district courts, which ultimately dismissed his claims. After his claims were dismissed, the FDIC issued an amended Standard Form 50 \u201cNotification of Personnel Action\u201d (\u201cSF-50\u201d) on June 18, 2002 indicating the following reasons for Elliott\u2019s removal: \u201cFALSIFICATION OF OFFICIAL FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS, AND INAPPROPRIATE OR DISRESPECTFUL CONDUCT.\u201d Five and a half years later, on February 20, 2008, Elliott filed a petition for enforcement with the Board, claiming that the amended SF-50 is \u201cfraudulent and libelous.\u201d The Board denied Elliott\u2019s petition. <em>2008 Decision </em>at 3. That decision became final on August 5, 2008, and Elliott timely appealed that decision to this court. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-6\">The sole issue in this appeal is whether the amended SF-50 correctly sets forth the reasons for Elliott\u2019s removal, which were previously sustained by the Board in its 1999 decision. The Board, in 2008, answered in the affirmative, finding that the amended SF-50 correctly states the reasons for Elliott\u2019s removal. <em>2008 Decision </em>at 3. We must affirm the Board\u2019s decision unless it was (1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b588-8\">We see no error in the Board\u2019s 2008 decision. In challenging the amended SF-50 in this appeal, Elliott does not argue that the agency lacks the general authority to issue or amend a former employee\u2019s SF-50 to reflect the grounds for removal sustained by the Board. Rather, his sole complaint is that the reasons for removal listed on the amended SF-50 are \u201cfraudulent and libelous.\u201d The amended SF-50 lists two reasons for Elliott\u2019s removal. Those two reasons \u2014 \u201cFALSIFICATION OF OFFICIAL FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS, AND INAPPROPRIATE OR DISRESPECTFUL CONDUCT\u201d \u2014 correspond nearly verbatim to the FDIC\u2019s two charges sustained in the Board\u2019s 1999 decision: (1) \u201cprovid[ing] incorrect and false information with specific intent to defraud the agency,\u201d and (2) \u201cen-gag[ing] in inappropriate or disrespectful conduct.\u201d <em>1999 Decision </em>at 7. Accordingly, the Board\u2019s conclusion that the amended SF-50 correctly states the reasons for Elliott\u2019s removal is supported by substantial evidence and is not contrary to law.</p>\n<p id=\"b588-9\">For the foregoing reasons, we <em>affirm.</em></p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
