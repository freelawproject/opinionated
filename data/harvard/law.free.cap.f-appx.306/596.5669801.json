Davis (\u201cDavis\u201d) petitions for review of a final order of the Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cBoard\u201d) denying Davis\u2019s petition for enforcement of a 1996 settlement agreement between Davis and the Department of the Treasury\u2019s Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d). <em>Davis v. Dept. of Treasury, </em>No. CH-0731-96-0040-C-1, 109 M.S.P.R. 28 (M.S.P.B. May 5, 2008). We <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b619-20\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b619-21\">On July 21, 1994, Davis was tentatively selected for a Criminal Investigator (Special Agent) position within the IRS, contingent upon successful completion of a drug test and a background investigation. According to a 1995 affidavit by the chief of the IRS Criminal Investigation Division, several issues identified during Davis\u2019s background investigation raised concerns, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"598\">*598</page-number>including financial delinquencies and alleged misstatements on Davis\u2019s federal employment applications concerning college degrees. As a result, Davis\u2019s selection for the Special Agent position was withdrawn. Davis appealed his non-selection to the Board on October 16, 1995, seeking \u201c[t]o be appointed to the position,\u201d and also filed an EEOC complaint. On-January 18, 1996, Davis and the IRS entered into a settlement agreement (\u201cAgreement\u201d) covering both the Board and EEOC actions. In the Agreement, the IRS agreed to \u201ccancel its negative suitability determination and select Mr. Davis for the position of Criminal Investigator (Special Agent) GS-1811, Grade 7.\u201d The agreement contained specific provisions stating that Davis would be given his highest previous rate of pay, that he would not be reimbursed for relocation expenses, that he waived all claims to attorney fees, and that he was required to satisfy all outstanding debts and judgments against him within six months. In addition, the Agreement noted that Davis would be required to \u201csatisfactorily complete all required training and satisfy all terms and conditions of employment as a Special Agent\u201d and that the agreement \u201ccontainled] all terms and conditions of the settlement. No other terms or conditions shall be binding unless placed in writing and signed by all of the parties.\u201d The Agreement contained no confidentiality provision and no provision expressly addressing Davis\u2019s alleged misstatements on employment applications. After the Agreement was entered into the Board\u2019s record for enforcement purposes, Davis was appointed as (and apparently remains) an IRS Special Agent.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-5\">The administrative record indicates that at some point in 2003, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Eastern District of Michigan requested that the IRS conduct a <em>Giglio </em>review for four Special Agents, including Davis, who were potential witnesses in a criminal investigation that appeared to be headed for trial (\u201cthe criminal tax case\u201d).<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Relying in part on Davis\u2019s alleged misstatements in his employment applications, the IRS concluded that Davis had potential <em>Giglio </em>problems and so informed the prosecutors. On December 4, 2003, Davis was informed by the IRS that his active cases, other than those already at the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for prosecution, would be transferred to another agent and that he would be reassigned to the intelligence section. After obtaining the necessary security clearance, Davis began work in that section.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-6\">Davis was ultimately not used as a witness in the criminal tax case, but discussions between the IRS and the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office concerning Davis continued for several years. Although the IRS apparently concluded that Davis had potential <em>Giglio </em>problems, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office declined to make an advance determination that it could not use Davis as a witness because of a <em>Giglio </em>problem. The U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office informed the IRS that it made <em>Giglio </em>determinations on a case-by-case basis, and that it would not make a determination whether Davis was <em>Giglio-imp&amp;ired </em>unless it became necessary to do so in connection with a case where his testimony was actually contemplated.</p>\n<p id=\"b620-7\">On March 21, 2007, Davis filed a petition with the Board seeking enforcement of the 1996 Agreement, contending that the IRS <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"599\">*599</page-number>\u201cbreached the settlement agreement and intentionally misrepresented [Davis\u2019s] professional record\u201d when on June 4, 2003, and on numerous subsequent occasions the IRS communicated to the United States Attorney\u2019s Office, in responding to a <em>Giglio </em>review, that Davis had falsified his federal employment application forms. For relief, Davis requested that the Board order the agency \u201cto remove and expunge all documentation ... that makes reference to [Davis] falsifying [his] pre-employment application forms.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b621-5\">An Administrative Judge (\u201cAJ\u201d) issued an initial decision on December 17, 2007. The AJ found that Davis was appointed as a Special Agent pursuant to the Agreement and that in the intervening years he had been promoted from GS-7 to GS-13. The AJ determined that the 1996 Agreement \u201ccontains no confidentiality clause\u201d and that \u201cno provision in the parties\u2019 agreement ... precludes the agency from transmitting information underlying the 1995 suitability determination and Board appeal, including the parties\u2019 settlement agreement, to the local United States Attorney to assist him or her in determining the scope, if any, of the appellant\u2019s potential <em>\u2018Giglio </em>impairment.\u2019 \u201d Finally, the AJ noted that the Agency had not actually proposed or taken an adverse personnel action against Davis based on the information underlying its 1995 suitability determination, but that if it did so in the future, Davis would be able to appeal that action. Accordingly, the AJ denied Davis\u2019s petition for enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b621-6\">On May 5, 2008, Davis\u2019s petition for review by the full Board was denied and the AJ\u2019s initial decision became the final decision of the Board. Davis timely petitioned this court for review, and we have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b621-8\">Our review of Board decisions is limited. We must affirm the decision of the Board unless it is \u201c(1) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law; (2) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or (3) unsupported by substantial evidence.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c); <em>see also Lary v. U.S. Postal Serv., </em>472 F.3d 1363, 1366-67 (Fed.Cir. 2006).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-9\">On appeal, Davis argues that the IRS breached the 1996 Agreement by \u201cmisrepresent[ing] the settlement agreement and [Davis\u2019s] professional history with the agency\u201d by disclosing to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office \u201cthat [Davis] falsified his pre-employment application forms when his suitability for employment as a special agent was being considered in 1995.\u201d We agree with the Board, however, that the Agreement, which states that it contains \u201call terms and conditions of the settlement,\u201d contains no confidentiality provision that would prohibit the disclosure of issues surrounding Davis\u2019s employment applications or settlement to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office. In addition, we would be reluctant to construe a confidentiality provision to limit the ability of an agency to disclose to the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office information necessary to allow the prosecutors to fulfill their obligations under <em>Giglio. </em>Such an interpretation would likely render the settlement provision unenforceable as contrary to public policy. <em>See Fomby-Denson v. Dep\u2019t of Army, </em>247 F.3d 1366, 1375-78 (Fed.Cir.2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b621-10\">Davis also argues that the Agreement should be interpreted to resolve the falsification dispute in his favor, stating \u201c[t]he parties!\u2019] understanding of the settlement agreement was that no falsification took place in the current or prior year background investigations which would pre<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"600\">*600</page-number>elude the appellant from being found suitable for employment and performing the full and essential duties and responsibilities of a law enforcement officer.\u201d No provision of the Agreement states that in agreeing to rescind its negative suitability determination, the IRS was additionally agreeing that the alleged falsifications had not occurred.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-4\">Davis additionally contends that the facts of this case are similar to <em>Conant v. Office of Personnel Management, </em>255 F.3d 1371 (Fed.Cir.2001), in which the court held that the IRS breached a settlement agreement when it later disclosed to another agency (the Office of Personnel Management) that the petitioner had not voluntarily resigned. Unlike the settlement in this case, however, the settlement agreement in <em>Conant </em>specifically required the IRS to rescind its original removal such that the legal record would reflect that Conant had resigned \u201cfor personal reasons.\u201d <em>Id. </em>at 1376. Moreover, disclosure of the original removal was inconsistent with a settlement agreement provision requiring the IRS to use \u201cbest efforts\u201d to assist Conant in obtaining disability retirement benefits from the Office of Personnel Management. <em>Id. </em>The Agreement reached by Davis and the IRS contains no such provisions.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-5\">Finally, Davis contends that the original 1995 suitability determination was procedurally deficient. The settlement agreement Davis entered into, however, was by its own terms a \u201cfull and complete settlement\u201d of his claims stemming from the 1995 events surrounding his initial non-selection as a Special Agent, and any alleged procedural irregularities that led to that negative suitability determination are no longer relevant. Having entered into an agreement representing a final settlement of issues stemming from the negative suitability determination in 1995, Davis may not now assert alleged procedural defects through this petition for enforcement.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-7\">Accordingly, we <em>affirm </em>the decision of the Board.</p>\n<p id=\"b622-8\">COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b622-9\">No costs.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b620-4\">. <em>Giglio v. United States, </em>405 U.S. 150, 153-54, 154, 92 S.Ct. 763, 31 L.Ed.2d 104 (1972), recognized the constitutional obligation of a prosecutor to disclose to the defendant evi-dence that affects the credibility of a government witness. <em>See Kahn v. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>528 F.3d 1336, 1340 n. 4 (Fed.Cir.2008).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
