Montante, Jr., denying Maldonado-Villatoro\u2019s request for voluntary departure. <em>In re Maldonado-Villatoro, </em>No. A97 913 234 (B.I.A. Feb. 8, 2008), <em>aff'g </em>No. A97 913 234 (Immig. Ct. Buffalo July 10, 2006). We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts and procedural history of the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b711-20\">We lack jurisdiction to consider the petition for review in this case. <em>See Carcamo v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>498 F.3d 94, 97 (2d Cir.2007) (\u201c[W]e now hold that the REAL ID Act ... does not grant us power to review the discretionary and factual determinations underlying the denial of an application for voluntary departure.\u201d). The Petitioner challenges the IJ\u2019s conclusion that he was not entitled to a favorable exercise of discretion by alleging that the IJ erred in failing to consider \u201cthe equities\u201d and focusing instead on the Petitioner\u2019s admitted use of marijuana as a basis for denying the Petitioner\u2019s request for voluntary departure. This argument \u201c \u2018merely quarrels over the correctness of the factual findings or justifications for the discretionary choices,\u2019 \u201d such that we lack jurisdiction to consider the petition for re<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"690\">*690</page-number>view. <em>Id. </em>at 98 (quoting <em>Xiao Ji Chen v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>471 F.3d 315, 329 (2d Cir.2006)). The Petitioner also argues that the IJ and the BIA violated his due process rights by \u201cfailing to apply the standards established by the immigration law.\u201d Although we have jurisdiction to review constitutional claims or questions of law in the context presented by the petition, <em>see Carcomo, </em>498 F.3d at 97-98, here, the Petitioner does not raise a colorable constitutional claim or question of law because he alleges neither a \u201ccolorable due process claim\u201d nor that the IJ\u2019s \u201cfact-finding [was] flawed by an error of law,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 98 (internal quotation marks omitted). Finally, that the Government did not oppose his request for voluntary departure, but left that determination to the IJ\u2019s discretion, presents no basis for concluding that the IJ committed either a constitutional violation or an error of law in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b712-4\">For the reasons stated above, the petition for review is DISMISSED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
