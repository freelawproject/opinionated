UNDERHILL,<footnotemark>*</footnotemark> District Judge.</p>\n<footnote data-order=\"9\" data-type=\"footnote\" id=\"x999-1\" label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b714-10\"> The Honorable Stefan R. Underhill, United States District Judge for the District of Connecticut, sitting by designation.</p>\n</footnote>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"majority\">\n<p id=\"b714-6\">SUMMARY ORDER</p>\n<p id=\"b714-7\">Plaintiff-Appellant Ashok Kashelkar appeals from the district court\u2019s September 2007 judgment adopting a report and recommendation (Katz, <em>Mag. </em>J.) that the district court grant the Defendants-Appellees\u2019 motions to dismiss Kashelkar\u2019s complaint. We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the remaining facts and the proceedings in the district court.</p>\n<p id=\"b714-8\">Kashelkar argues that the district court erred in granting the Defendants-Appellees\u2019 motions to dismiss his complaint for failure to state a claim pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6). We review <em>de novo </em>the district court\u2019s grant of a Rule 12(b)(6) motion. <em>See Chambers v. Time Warner, Inc., </em>282 F.3d 147, 152 (2d Cir.2002).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-9\">The district court properly dismissed Kashelkar\u2019s federal claims. Kashelkar failed to state a claim against any Defendant-Appellee under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, as he failed to allege that any of the Defendants-Appellees were state actors. <em>See Ciambriello v. County of Nassau, </em>292 F.3d 307, 323 (2d Cir.2002) (holding that, to state a claim under Section 1983 against a private party, a complaint must allege facts showing that the private party was acting \u201cunder color of state law\u201d). He also failed to allege sufficient facts to state a claim under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1985. <em>See Gyadu v. Hartford Ins. Co., </em>197 F.3d 590, 591 (2d Cir.1999) (\u201c[A] complaint containing only conclusory, vague, or general allegations of conspiracy to deprive a person of constitutional rights cannot withstand a motion to dismiss.\u201d) (internal quotation marks omitted). Kashelkar\u2019s 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981 claims fail as well, as he alleged neither that he was a member of a racial minority nor that the DefendantsAppellees had discriminated against him on that basis. <em>See Mian v. Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Sec. Corp., </em>7 F.3d 1085, 1087 (2d Cir.1993) (\u201cTo establish a claim under \u00a7 1981, a plaintiff must allege facts in support of the following elements: (1) the plaintiff is a member of a racial minority; (2) an intent to discriminate on the basis of race by the defendant; and (3) the discrimination concerned one or more of the activities enumerated in the statute .... \u201d). Finally, because 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1341 does not create a private right of action, Kashelkar failed to state a cognizable claim under the mail fraud statute. <em>See Official Publications, Inc. v. Kable News Co., </em>884 F.2d 664, 667 (2d Cir.1989) (noting that the Mail Fraud Act does not create a private right of action).</p>\n<p id=\"b714-13\">The district court also properly dismissed Kashelkar\u2019s state law claims. With respect to the fraud claim, Kashelkar alleged neither that he had relied on any Defendant-Appellee\u2019s misrepresentation, <em>see Cohen v. Houseconnect Realty Corp., </em>289 A.D.2d 277, 278, 734 N.Y.S.2d 205, 206 (2d Dep\u2019t 2001), nor any of the particulars required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b). Further, his complaint was not sufficient to state a claim that the Defendants-Appellees conspired to defraud him, as he did not allege specific times, facts or circumstances relating to the alleged conspiracy between the Defendants-Appellees, nor did he allege a wrongful act in furtherance of the conspiracy. <em>See Gold-</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"693\">*693</page-number><em>stein v. Siegel, </em>19 A.D.2d 489, 492, 244 N.Y.S.2d 378, 382 (1st Dep\u2019t 1963) (\u201cA bare conclusory allegation of conspiracy is usually held insufficient.\u201d). Kashelkar also failed to state a claim under New York Judiciary Law \u00a7 487, as his complaint articulated neither what damages he allegedly suffered as a result of the DefendantAppellees\u2019 alleged deceit nor any instance in which any Defendant-Appellee engaged in conduct intended to deceive Kashelkar or the relevant court. <em>See </em>N.Y. Jud. Law \u00a7 487 (providing for civil liability where an attorney \u201c[i]s guilty of deceit or collusion ... with intent to deceive the court or any party ...\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-5\">Finally, Kashelkar\u2019s remaining claims, which constitute an attack on the process by which this case was decided below, lack merit. To the extent that Kashelkar alleges that the district court judge was biased against him, he points to no evidence of judicial bias in the record other than his dissatisfaction with the court\u2019s rulings, and \u201cjudicial rulings alone almost never constitute a valid basis for a bias or partiality motion.\u201d <em>Liteky v. United States, </em>510 U.S. 540, 555, 114 S.Ct. 1147, 127 L.Ed.2d 474 (1994). There is also no evidence to support Kashelkar\u2019s claim that district court personnel mishandled his case or improperly decided his claims. The district court did not violate Kashelkar\u2019s constitutional rights by referring the case to a magistrate judge, as authorized by 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1)(B) and (C). <em>See United States v. Raddatz, </em>447 U.S. 667, 680-81, 100 S.Ct. 2406, 65 L.Ed.2d 424 (1980) (finding that the Federal Magistrates Act does not violate due process).</p>\n<p id=\"b715-6\">For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the judgment of the district court.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
