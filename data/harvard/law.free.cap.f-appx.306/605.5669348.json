Gowings petitions for review of an initial decision of the Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cBoard\u201d) dismissing Mr. Gowings\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction, <em>Gowings v. Dep\u2019t of Def., </em>No. DC315H080213-I-1 (M.S.P.B. Apr.l, 2008) <em>(\u201cBoard Decision\u201d), </em>which became final after the full board denied his petition for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"606\">*606</page-number>review. Because we agree that Mr. Gowings has not established jurisdiction, we <em>affirm.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b628-4\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b628-5\">On September 19, 2007, Mr. Gowings was appointed to a position in the Department of Defense (\u201cAgency\u201d), subject to completion of a one-year probationary period. Before expiration of that year, the Agency terminated Mr. Gowings, effective December 1, 2007, for \u201cundependability as evidenced by [his] pattern of using unscheduled leave.\u201d Mr. Gowings appealed his termination to the Board where he: (1) challenged the basis of his termination, asserting that his unscheduled leave was excused by medical certificates; and (2) alleged that, despite the Agency\u2019s asserted grounds, his termination was actually based upon a his failure to satisfy a preappointment condition.</p>\n<p id=\"b628-6\">During the proceedings, the administrative judge explained to Mr. Gowings that, because he was terminated during a probationary period, the Board\u2019s jurisdiction only permitted him to appeal on limited grounds, as provided by 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.806. After giving Mr. Gowings an opportunity to establish the Board\u2019s jurisdiction, the administrative judge found that the Board lacked jurisdiction and dismissed Mr. Gowings\u2019s appeal. <em>Board Decision </em>at 6. After the full Board denied Mr. Gowings\u2019s petition for review, he sought review by this court. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1295(a)(9).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b628-8\">The Board\u2019s jurisdiction is limited to those matters prescribed by the applicable laws, rules, and regulations. <em>Torain v. U.S. Postal Serv., </em>83 F.3d 1420, 1422 (Fed. Cir.1996) (citing 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7701(a)). Whether the Board has jurisdiction is a question of law that we review without deference, but we are bound by the Board\u2019s underlying factual findings \u201cunless those findings are not supported by substantial evidence.\u201d <em>Bolton v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., </em>154 F.3d 1313, 1316 (Fed.Cir. 1998); <em>see </em>5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703(c). Mr. Gowings has the burden of establishing the Board\u2019s jurisdiction. <em>See </em>5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1201.56(a)(2)(i).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-11\">An employee terminated during a probationary period has a limited right of appeal to the Board. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.806(a); <em>Pervez v. Dep\u2019t of the Navy, </em>193 F.3d 1371, 1375 (Fed.Cir.1999). First, the Board has jurisdiction over an allegation that the termination was based on partisan political reasons or marital status. 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 315.806(b). Mr. Gowings does not allege that his termination was based on either of these factors. Second, the Board has jurisdiction over an allegation that the termination was based on pre-appointment reasons, but was not effected in accordance with the procedural requirements of \u00a7 315.805. <em>Id. </em>at \u00a7 315.806(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b628-13\">In an attempt to establish jurisdiction under the latter provision, Mr. Gowings argues that his termination was based on a pre-appointment reason, despite the explanation in the termination letter that he was terminated because of post-appointment conduct. In rejecting this contention, the Board found that Mr. Gowings \u201cproffered no facts to show that his termination was based on circumstances other than those cited in the agency\u2019s termination letter.\u201d <em>Board Decision </em>at 4. On appeal, Mr. Gowings does not point to any evidence to the contrary. Rather, Mr. Gowings appears to contend that his failure to satisfy a condition of appointment (specifically, a residency requirement) rendered his appointment erroneous and unlawful and, thus, this pre-appointment reason must be considered because it occurred <em>prior </em>to his post-appointment conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"607\">*607</page-number>There is sufficient evidence to support the Board\u2019s factual finding that Mr. Gowings failed to show that his termination was based on a pre-appointment reason. Moreover, the Board correctly determined that it lacked authority, without more, to review the validity of Mr. Gowings\u2019s original appointment. <em>Board Decision </em>at 4-5. Accordingly, we perceive no error in the Board\u2019s conclusion that Mr. Gowings did not establish that the Board had jurisdiction. Finally, having concluded that the Board lacks jurisdiction, we do not reach Mr. Gowings\u2019s arguments regarding the merits of his appeal (e.g., whether the agency improperly disregarded medical certificates when it decided to terminate Mr. Gowings and whether he deserves compensation for expenses incurred when starting an allegedly erroneous appointment).</p>\n<p id=\"b629-5\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the Board\u2019s decision to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p id=\"b629-6\">COSTS</p>\n<p id=\"b629-7\">Each party shall bear its own costs.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
