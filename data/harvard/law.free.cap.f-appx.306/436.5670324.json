Docs. 10, 48 at 5 H 8(a), 57. He was sentenced to 51 months\u2019 imprisonment followed by five years\u2019 supervised release. R. Doc. 57 at 2-3. He now appeals the denial of his motion to suppress the marijuana, arguing that the traffic stop and subsequent search violated his Fourth Amendment rights. Our jurisdiction arises under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291, and we affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b459-22\">\n<em>Background</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b459-23\">On April 12, 2007, Agent Troy Wall of the Canine Interdiction Unit of the Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics observed a white Ford Expedition heading eastbound <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"438\">*438</page-number>on Interstate 40. Tr. (9/4/2007) 7-8. The agent testified that he had just completed a traffic stop and was preparing to merge into eastbound traffic with his rear emergency lights on. Tr. 8. The agent saw the Expedition approaching from behind at a slow rate of speed, and observed that the driver did not signal when he changed lanes to yield to the agent\u2019s emergency vehicle. Tr. 8. According to the agent, the Expedition then made \u201can exaggerated lane change\u201d back into its original lane, signaling for about 300 feet and then taking another 300 feet to change lanes. Tr. 8. The agent pulled into the eastbound lane of Interstate 40 and followed the vehicle. Tr. 10. As he did so, he checked its registration, discovering that it was registered to Clemente Bravo from Deming, New Mexico. The agent then stopped Mr. Bravo. Tr. 10-11.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-4\">When the agent approached the passenger side of the vehicle, he observed a male driver and a female passenger and smelled the \u201coverwhelming\u201d odor of air fresheners. Tr. 11-12. When he examined the insurance and registration documents, which were the only items in the glove box, the agent saw that the vehicle had been recently registered. Tr. 13. He also observed that the only luggage in the vehicle was a small blue duffel bag. Tr. 14, 37-38. The agent then had Mr. Bravo exit the vehicle, informed him that he had stopped him because of his unsafe lane change, and had him get into the patrol car as he filled out a warning. Tr. 14-15.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-5\">While the agent filled out the paperwork, he engaged Mr. Bravo in conversation about Mr. Bravo\u2019s travel plans. Mr. Bravo said that he was going on his honeymoon with his passenger, Ms. Felix, and was headed to Kansas. Tr. 15-16. According to the agent, Mr. Bravo would not tell him which city in Kansas he was headed to, instead telling him that he was going \u201cnowhere in particular\u201d and then talking about both Oklahoma and Kansas. Tr. 16. The agent testified that, while it is normal to be slightly nervous in these circumstances, Mr. Bravo displayed \u201can extreme form of nervousness\u201d; his hands were trembling, he avoided eye contact, he stammered, and his carotid pulse was abnormal. Tr. 17. Becoming suspicious of Mr. Bravo\u2019s story, the agent then returned to the Ford Expedition to talk to the passenger. Tr. 18. According to the agent, Ms. Felix said that they were on vacation and were going to Oklahoma, then said they were going to Kansas. Tr. 18. When asked about her relationship with Mr. Bravo, she indicated that he was her boyfriend and they were not married. Tr. 18.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-7\">Six minutes into the stop, the agent called for a drug dog. Tr. 41-43, 61. The agent simultaneously received notification that Mr. Bravo had been arrested for drug violations in 2006. Tr. 19, 61. The agent issued a warning to Mr. Bravo and the traffic stop ended approximately ten minutes after it had begun. Tr. 19-20, 61-62.</p>\n<p id=\"b460-8\">The agent then asked Mr. Bravo if he could ask him a few more questions, and Mr. Bravo agreed. Tr. 20. When the agent asked whether Mr. Bravo had any illegal drugs in his vehicle, Mr. Bravo said no and declined to consent to a search of his vehicle or to have a drug dog \u201cscan\u201d it. The agent then directed Mr. Bravo to return to the patrol car. Tr. 20-21. Shortly thereafter, another agent arrived with the drug dog \u201cJake\u201d and the dog alerted to the presence of drugs. Tr. 21-22, 63-64. At that point, six minutes had elapsed from the issuance of the warning to the point when the drug dog alerted. Tr. 62-64. Confronted with the information about the contraband, Mr. Bravo admitted that the vehicle contained marijuana. The agents searched the vehicle and ultimately discov<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"439\">*439</page-number>ered 482 pounds of bundled marijuana in hidden compartments. Tr. 22-24.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-5\">After an evidentiary hearing, the district court denied Mr. Bravo\u2019s motion to suppress after finding that (1) the agent\u2019s initial stop was justified, Tr. 66; (2) the continued detention of Mr. Bravo was lawful because it was based upon reasonable suspicion, Tr. 66-67; and (3) after the drug dog alerted, there was probable cause to search the vehicle, Tr. 67-68. The district court relied upon the following factors as giving rise to reasonable suspicion: (1) the agent\u2019s observation of numerous air fresheners in the vehicle, along with the strong smell of air fresheners; (2) the minimal amount of baggage in the vehicle, which was inconsistent with Mr. Bravo\u2019s honeymoon story; (3) inconsistent statements made by Mr. Bravo and Ms. Felix, including the inconsistency regarding their marriage and destination; (4) Mr. Bravo\u2019s extreme nervousness, including trembling, heavy carotid pulse, noticeable belching, avoidance of eye contact, rapid speech and stammering; and (5) information regarding Mr. Bravo\u2019s prior drug-related arrest.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Tr. 64-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-6\">\n<em>Discussion</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b461-7\">When reviewing a district court\u2019s denial of a motion to suppress, we view the evidence in the light most favorable to the government and accept the district court\u2019s findings of fact unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>United States v. Chavira, </em>467 F.3d 1286, 1290 (10th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Rosborough, </em>366 F.3d 1145, 1148 (10th Cir.2004). We review the ultimate issue of Fourth Amendment reasonableness de novo. <em>United States v. Alcaraz-Arellano, </em>441 F.3d 1252, 1258 (10th Cir. 2006). Mr. Bravo bears the burden to prove the challenged search and seizure was unlawful. <em>Rosborough, </em>366 F.3d at 1148.</p>\n<p id=\"b461-10\">The Fourth Amendment provides that \u201c[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.... \u201d U.S. Const, amend. IV; <em>see Mapp v. Ohio, </em>367 U.S. 643, 655-57, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081 (1961) (incorporating the Fourth Amendment to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment). A traffic stop is a seizure for the purposes of the Fourth Amendment. <em>Delaware v. Prouse, </em>440 U.S. 648, 653, 99 S.Ct. 1391, 59 L.Ed.2d 660 (1979); <em>United States v. Laughrin, </em>438 F.3d 1245, 1247 (10th Cir.2006). We analyze traffic stops under the \u201creasonable suspicion\u201d rubric set out in <em>Terry v. Ohio, </em>392 U.S. 1, 27, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968). <em>United States v. Callarman, </em>273 F.3d 1284, 1286-87 (10th Cir.2001); <em>United States v. West, </em>219 F.3d 1171, 1176 (10th Cir.2000). In making the <em>Terry </em>inquiry in the traffic stop context, we inquire as to whether the traffic stop was justified at its inception and whether it was reasonably related in scope to the circumstances that justified the interference in the first place. <em>Id.; United States v. Botero-Ospina, </em>71 F.3d 783, 786 (10th Cir.1995) (en banc).</p>\n<p id=\"b461-11\">Here, we conclude that, given the findings of the district court, the traffic stop was justified at its inception. \u201c[A] traffic stop is valid under the Fourth Amendment if the stop is based on an observed traffic violation or if the police <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"440\">*440</page-number>officer has reasonable articulable suspicion that a traffic or equipment violation has occurred or is occurring.\u201d <em>Botero-Ospina, </em>71 F.3d at 787. The district court found that Mr. Bravo \u201cchanged lanes without signaling\u201d and was observed by an agent doing so. Tr. 57. Thus, the agent observed a traffic violation, namely, Mr. Bravo\u2019s failure to comply with Okla. Stat. Ann. tit. 47 \u00a7 11-309(2) (2007). We do not look beyond the observed traffic violation to the subjective intent of the officer in order to determine whether the traffic stop is a \u201cpretext\u201d for pursuing some other investigatory purpose. <em>Whren v. United States, </em>517 U.S. 806, 809-16, 116 S.Ct. 1769, 135 L.Ed.2d 89 (1996); <em>see City of Indianapolis v. Edmond, </em>531 U.S. 32, 45, 121 S.Ct. 447, 148 L.Ed.2d 333 (2000) (recognizing that <em>Whren </em>has established that \u201can individual officer\u2019s subjective intentions are irrelevant to the Fourth Amendment validity of a traffic stop that is justified objectively by probable cause to believe that a traffic violation has occurred\u201d); <em>United States v. Burkley, </em>513 F.3d 1183, 1186 (10th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b462-4\">However, Mr. Bravo challenges the validity of the traffic stop by arguing that a stop conducted by the Canine Interdiction Unit of the Oklahoma Bureau of Narcotics is the equivalent of a roving drug checkpoint program that the Supreme Court struck down in <em>Edmond. </em>Aplt. Br. 8. However, Mr. Bravo did not preserve this issue for appeal. While Mr. Bravo reserved the right to appeal the denial of the motion to suppress, R. Doc. 48 at 5 118(a), we note that \u201c[a] reservation of the right to appeal a specific pretrial ruling by the district court extends only to theories raised in the challenged ruling,\u201d <em>United States v. Ochoa-Colchado, </em>521 F.3d 1292, 1299 (10th Cir.2008). Mr. Bravo did not argue that the initial stop violated <em>Edmond </em>in his written motion, supplement, or oral presentation to the district court; rather, he argued that the agent lacked reasonable suspicion to detain him after the traffic stop, that the agent lacked jurisdiction as a narcotics officer to stop him for a traffic violation, and that the agent\u2019s actions constituted selective enforcement violative of the Equal Protection Clause. <em>See </em>R. Doc. 18 at 3, 7, 14-15; R. Doc. 37. Accordingly, Mr. Bravo failed to preserve the <em>Edmond </em>argument for appeal.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b462-7\">Mr. Bravo further argues that, even if the initial stop was justified, its scope and length was unjustified. First, he argues that the agent converted the traffic stop into the functional equivalent of a custodial arrest by placing Mr. Bravo in the back of the agent\u2019s car and that, accordingly, any statements he made in response to the agent\u2019s questions should not have been used to justify his continued detention because they were taken in violation of <em>Miranda v. Arizona, </em>384 U.S. 436, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). Aplt. Br. 13-14; <em>see Rhode Island v. Innis, </em>446 U.S, 291, 297, 300-02, 100 S.Ct. 1682, 64 L.Ed.2d 297 (1980). This first argument was not properly preserved for appellate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"441\">*441</page-number>review, as it was not raised in the motion to suppress. R. Doc. 18. Accordingly, we do not reach this particular theory as to why Mr. Bravo\u2019s continued detention was unlawful.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> <em>See Ochoa-Colchado, </em>521 F.3d at 1299.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-5\">Second, Mr. Bravo argues that his continued detention cannot be justified by the factors the district court relied upon to find that the agent had the reasonable suspicion necessary to continue the detention once the traffic stop was complete. Aplt. Br. 15-18. \u201cOnce the warning or citation has been issued and the driver\u2019s license and registration have been returned, ... the officer generally must allow the driver to proceed without further delay.\u201d <em>United States v. Karam, </em>496 F.3d 1157, 1161 (10th Cir.2007); <em>see Illinois v. Caballes, </em>543 U.S. 405, 407, 125 S.Ct. 834, 160 L.Ed.2d 842 (2005) (stating that a traffic stop can become unlawful if prolonged beyond the time reasonably required for that purpose). \u201cFurther detention is permissible only if \u2018(1) the officer develops an objectively reasonable and articulable suspicion that the driver is engaged in some illegal activity, or (2) the initial detention becomes a consensual encounter.\u2019 \u201d <em>Karam, </em>496 F.3d at 1161 (quoting <em>Rosborough, </em>366 F.3d at 1148) (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). Here, the continued detention was not consensual after Mr. Bravo refused to grant consent to search his vehicle or run a drug dog around it. Tr. 20, 63-64. Accordingly, the case turns on whether the agent possessed objectively reasonable, articulable suspicion of criminal activity at that point in order to continue the detention without Mr. Bravo\u2019s consent. <em>Rosborough, </em>366 F.3d at 1148.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-8\">To determine whether an investigatory stop is supported by reasonable suspicion, this court \u201cmust look at the \u2018totality of the circumstances\u2019 ... to see whether the detaining officer has a \u2018particularized and objective basis\u2019 for suspecting legal wrongdoing.\u201d <em>United States v. Arvizu, </em>534 U.S. 266, 273, 122 S.Ct. 744, 151 L.Ed.2d 740 (2002); <em>see Karam, </em>496 F.3d at 1162. We assess each factor individually but consider whether the factors taken as a whole support a finding of reasonable, articulable suspicion. <em>Karam, </em>496 F.3d at 1162.</p>\n<p id=\"b463-9\">The factors the district court relied upon do in fact support the finding that the agent had reasonable, articulable suspicion to detain Mr. Bravo for the brief period between the moment the agent gave Mr. Bravo the traffic warning and the moment the drug dog alerted, giving probable cause to search the vehicle. <em>See </em>Tr. 62-63 (setting forth the district court\u2019s finding that this five or six minute period was the extended detention period for which reasonable, articulable suspicion was necessary). We have noted that each factor relied upon by the district court is a valid consideration, including (1) the air freshener, <em>United States v. West, </em>219 F.3d 1171, 1178-79 (10th Cir.2000); (2) the minimal baggage visible in a vehicle without a trunk, considering Mr. Bravo\u2019s honeymoon story, <em>United States v. Ledesma, </em>447 F.3d 1307, 1318 (10th Cir.2006); <em>United States v. Mendez, </em>118 F.3d 1426, 1431 n. 3 (10th Cir.1997); (3) the contradictory answers of Mr. Bravo and Ms. Felix, <em>United States v. Wallace, </em>429 F.3d 969, 976 (10th Cir.2005); (4) numerous physical manifestations of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"442\">*442</page-number>nervousness, <em>United States v. Bradford, </em>423 F.3d 1149, 1157 (10th Cir.2005); <em>United States v. Santos, </em>403 F.3d 1120, 1127 (10th Cir.2005); and (5) prior drug history, <em>Santos, </em>403 F.3d at 1132. Judging from these several factors<footnotemark>4</footnotemark> under the totality of the circumstances, we conclude that the agent was justified in briefly detaining Mr. Bravo while waiting for the arrival of the drug dog.</p>\n<p id=\"b464-6\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b459-24\"> This order and judgment is not binding precedent, except under the doctrines of law of the case, res judicata, and collateral estoppel. It may be cited, however, for its persuasive value consistent with Fed. R.App. P. 32.1 and 10th Cir. R. 32.1.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b461-8\">. Three other factors piqued the agent\u2019s suspicions: (1) the vehicle came from a narcotics source city and was traveling northeast, Tr. 10-11, 21; (2) the glove box was not \u201cfull of junk,\" and contained only insurance and registration papers, Tr. 12-13; and (3) the vehicle was recently registered, Tr. 13-14. The court did not list these as among \"the more cogent factors\u201d it relied upon. Tr. 64-65.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b462-5\">. Moreover, this case is easily distinguishable from <em>Edmond </em>and therefore the argument is without merit. <em>Edmond </em>involved a programmatic purpose to uncover evidence of ordinary criminal .wrongdoing (drug trafficking), <em>Edmond, </em>531 U.S. at 40-43, 121 S.Ct. 447, \u201cwithout individualized suspicion,\u201d <em>id. </em>at 45-46, 121 S.Ct. 447. Here, in contrast, the programmatic purpose of drug interdiction which the agent testified to, Tr. 29-32, is carried out only when there is individualized suspicion that a traffic violation has occurred. Because the stop was objectively justified, we do not look beyond that justification to the officer\u2019s unit assignment. <em>See United States v. Patterson, </em>472 F.3d 767, 775 (10th Cir.2006) (finding a stop to be justified even though the officer's unit assignment was to detect drug couriers).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b463-6\">. In any event, persons detained during a traffic stop typically are not \"in custody\" for purposes of <em>Miranda. Wilson v. Sirmons, </em>536 F.3d 1064, 1110 (10th Cir.2008). We do not believe Mr. Bravo has demonstrated that the agent's actions were sufficient to transform the traffic stop into a custodial interrogation. <em>See United States v. Raynor, </em>108 Fed.Appx. 609, 613 (10th Cir.2004) (unpublished opinion).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"4\">\n<p id=\"b464-4\">. We note that the contradictory statements regarding Mr. Bravo\u2019s marital status and travel plans were particularly cogent in terms of creating reasonable suspicion. As noted, the district court did not rely upon the source city and route (leaving Deming, New Mexico in a. northeasterly direction), the glove box containing only insurance and registration papers, and relatively recent registration papers in its reasonable suspicion analysis, nor do we.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
