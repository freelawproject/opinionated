In sentencing him, the district court<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> determined that Nunez was responsible for 310 pounds of marijuana seized from a car driven by a co-defendant. Nunez argues on appeal, as he did below, that he was responsible for only a portion of the 310 pounds, because the additional marijuana was not possessed in furtherance of a jointly undertaken criminal activity and was not reasonably foreseeable to him. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 IB 1.3(a)(1)(B) (relevant conduct for case involving \u201cjointly undertaken criminal activity\u201d includes all reasonably foreseeable acts of others in furtherance of criminal activity).</p>\n<p id=\"b350-21\">Foreseeability aside, we hold that Nunez was responsible for the additional marijuana under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(A) (relevant conduct includes all acts \u201ccommitted, aided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, procured, or willfully caused\u201d by defendant), because he pled guilty to aiding and abetting his codefendant\u2019s possession of marijuana with intent to distribute. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 1B1.3, comment, (n.2) (requirement of reasonable foreseeability does not apply to conduct that defendant personally undertakes, aids, abets, counsels, commands, induces, procures, or willfully causes; such conduct is addressed under subsection (a)(1)(A)); <em>United States v. Goings, </em>200 F.3d 539, 544 (8th Cir.2000) (this court may affirm sentence on any grounds supported by record); <em>cf. United States v. Strange, </em>102 F.3d 356, 358-61 (8th Cir.1996) (holding that defendant who <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"329\">*329</page-number>arranged for marijuana to be shipped from supplier to third party was responsible for quantity of cocaine shipped even though he was unaware that cocaine had been sent; under \u00a7 lB1.3(a)(l)(A), and without regard to reasonable foreseeability, defendant was accountable at sentencing for full quantity of all illegal drugs because he aided, abetted, and willfully caused shipment with expectation of receiving some type of illegal drug to distribute).</p>\n<p id=\"b351-5\">Accordingly, the district court\u2019s judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b350-22\">.
