On appeal, the Locketts procedurally contend that we should recuse ourselves and that we are without appellate jurisdiction. With respect to the substantive issues, the Locketts argue that the Tax Court improperly required them to substantiate then* deductions and incorrectly found that they had not substantiated the deductions claimed for tax years 2001, 2002, and 2003.<footnotemark>2</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b487-20\">I.</p>\n<p id=\"b487-21\">By statute, \u201c[a]ny justice, judge, or magistrate judge of the United States shall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 455(a). When considering whether recusal is appropri<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"466\">*466</page-number>ate, we consider \u201cwhether an objective, disinterested, lay observer folly informed of the facts underlying the grounds on which recusal was sought would entertain, a significant doubt about the judge\u2019s impartiality.\u201d <em>Bolin v. Story, </em>225 F.3d 1234, 1239 (11th Cir.2000) (citation omitted). Generally, the claim of bias under \u00a7 455 \u201cmust show that the bias is personal as distinguished from judicial in nature.\u201d <em>Id. </em>(citation omitted). Thus, unless \u201cpervasive bias is shown, a judge\u2019s rulings in the same or a related case are not a sufficient basis for recusal.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b488-4\">Because the record demonstrates that our only interaction with the Locketts has been the issuance of opinions resolving their cases in the course of judicial proceedings without a display of bias, we conclude that recusal is not necessary. <em>See Bolin, </em>225 F.3d at 1239.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-5\">II.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-6\">We review issues of jurisdiction <em>de novo. Federal Election Comm\u2019n v. Reform Party of United States, </em>479 F.3d 1302, 1306-07 (11th Cir.2007). Section 7429 of Title 26 of the United States Code authorizes the Tax Court to exercise jurisdiction over, and enter a judgment in, a civil action for determination of tax liability. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7429(b)(2)(B). Although its principal office is in the District of Columbia, the Tax Court may sit anywhere in the United States. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7445, 7446. Section 7482 of Title 26 of the United States Code provides for appellate review of a Tax Court decision to be in the circuit of the petitioner\u2019s legal residence or where stipulated in writing by government and petitioner. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7482(b)(1)(A) and (2); <em>Becker v. Comm\u2019r of Internal Revenue, </em>852 F.2d 524, 524-25 (11th Cir. 1988). If a Tax Court decision is appealed to the wrong circuit, the circuit may transfer the appeal to the appropriate circuit. <em>Becker, </em>852 F.2d at 525-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-11\">Having reviewed the record and the briefs of the parties, we conclude that jurisdiction is proper. The Locketts undisputedly live within the Eleventh Circuit. The Internal Revenue Service has not stipulated to review in another circuit. Therefore, the Circuit for the District of Columbia properly transferred this appeal for our review. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7482(b)(1)(A) and (2); <em>Becker, </em>852 F.2d at 525-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-12\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b488-13\">\u201cWe review <em>de novo </em>the tax court\u2019s conclusions of law and review findings of fact for clear error.\u201d <em>Davis v. Comm\u2019r of Internal Revenue, </em>210 F.3d 1346, 1347 (11th Cir.2000). The taxpayer bears the burden of submitting evidence that supports his claim of entitlement to a deduction and the amount of that entitlement. <em>Gatlin v. Comm\u2019r of Internal Revenue, </em>754 F.2d 921, 923 (11th Cir.1985). Further, unsupported allegations by a taxpayer of misconduct by the government and others is not considered as credible evidence to meet his burden. <em>Hradesky v. Comm\u2019r of Internal Revenue, </em>540 F.2d 821, 823 n. 2 (5th Cir. 1976).<footnotemark>3</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b488-14\">Section 6001 of the Internal Revenue Code (\u201cIRC\u201d) requires that a taxpayer must keep and maintain financial records sufficient to permit verification of income and expenses. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6001. When taxpayers\u2019 records are lost or destroyed through circumstances beyond their control, they are entitled to substantiate the claimed deductions by use of other credible evidence. <em>Villarreal v. Comm\u2019r of In</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"467\">*467</page-number><em>ternal Revenue, </em>76 T.C.M. (CCH) 920 (1998). However, the Tax Court is not bound to accept unverified, undocumented testimony of a taxpayer. <em>Id. </em>Although the Tax Court may estimate amounts, any estimations must have a reasonable evidentiary basis. <em>Id. </em>From our review of the record, we discern no evidentiary or burden of proof errors.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-5\">Discounting Mr. Lockett\u2019s incredible testimony, the record does not support a conclusion that the government had \u201cunclean hands\u201d in an equitable sense, or that the Locketts\u2019 property and possessions were illegally foreclosed upon, stolen, or otherwise coerced from them. Further, Mr. Lockett admitted that the family property was foreclosed due to failure to make mortgage payments, that he had seven days to remove belongings, and that he had \u201cseven warehouses\u201d of documents related to the case. Thus, the Locketts did not demonstrate that records were lost or destroyed due to circumstances beyond their control, so as to entitle them to substantiate their deductions through other credible evidence. Even so, the Tax Court did not require the Locketts to produce documents that were allegedly destroyed or stolen. Instead, the Tax Court requested that the Locketts present other credible evidence to support a reasonable estimate to determine the deductible amount of the losses. However, the Locketts did not offer any verification or documentation to support Mr. Lockett\u2019s testimony with respect to valuation.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-6\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-7\">In reviewing a Tax Court decision, we will only find clear error if we are left with a definite conviction that a mistake was made. <em>Coggin v. Comm\u2019r of Internal Revenue, </em>71 F.3d 855, 860 (11th Cir.1996). Further, \u201c[t]he Commissioner\u2019s determination of a deficiency is presumed correct, and the taxpayer has the burden of proving it is incorrect.\u201d <em>Webb v. Comm\u2019r of Internal Revenue, </em>872 F.2d 380, 381 (11th Cir.1989). Taxpayers must submit evidence that supports them claims of entitlement to a deduction and the amount of that entitlement. <em>Gatlin, </em>754 F.2d at 923.</p>\n<p id=\"b489-9\">IRC section 165 permits for a deduction for any loss that: (1) occurs during the taxable year; and (2) is not compensated for by insurance, or otherwise. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 165(a). Generally, the deductible amount is determined by the fair market value prior to the loss or the adjusted basis in the property. 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.165-7(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-10\">Individuals may claim losses of property arising from fire or theft. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 165(c). Individual casualty losses must exceed $600.00 ($100 for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2009); their value is reduced by the amounts of reimbursement received, and they may be claimed to the extent the loss exceeds 10% of the taxpayer\u2019s adjusted gross income. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 165(h). Theft losses are treated as being sustained during the taxable year in which they are discovered. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 165(e). We have defined theft as \u201cany criminal appropriation of another\u2019s property to the use of the taker.\u201d <em>Edwards v. Bromberg, </em>232 F.2d 107, 110 (5th Cir.1956); <em>accord with </em>26 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.165-8(d). Generally, foreclosures and repossession do not constitute theft or casualty loss. <em>Johnson v. Comm\u2019r of Internal Revenue, </em>81 T.C.M. (CCH) 1538 (2001).</p>\n<p id=\"b489-11\">Additionally, individuals may claim losses incurred in a trade or business. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 165(c). For a taxpayer to be carrying on a trade or business, the \u201ctaxpayer must be involved in the activity with continuity and regularity and ... the taxpayer\u2019s primary purpose for engaging in the activity must be for income or profit.\u201d <em>Comm\u2019r of Internal Revenue v. Groetzing</em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"468\">*468</page-number>er, 480 U.S. 23, 35, 107 S.Ct. 980, 987, 94 L.Ed.2d 25 (1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-4\">A taxpayer may deduct expenses that are ordinary and necessary in carrying on a trade or business, but may not deduct personal, living, or family expenses. 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 262(a). To be deductible, an item must: \u201c(1) be paid or incurred during the taxable year; (2) be for carrying on any trade or business; (3) be an expense; (4) be a necessary expense; and (5) be an ordinary expense.\u201d <em>Comm\u2019r of Internal Revenue v. Lincoln Sav. &amp; Loan Ass\u2019n, </em>403 U.S. 345, 352, 91 S.Ct. 1893, 1898, 29 L.Ed.2d 519 (1971) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-5\">IRC section 217 allows as \u201ca deduction moving expenses paid or incurred during the taxable year in connection with the commencement of work by the taxpayer as an employee or as a self-employed individual at a new principal place of work.\u201d 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 217(a). The new principal place of work must be at least 50 miles from the taxpayer\u2019s former residence. <em>Id. </em>\u00a7 217(c)(1)(A).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-6\">Based on our review of the record, we discern no error in the Tax Court\u2019s determination that the tax deficiencies for tax years 2001, 2002, and 2003 were correct. Although the Locketts submitted pictures of a burned residence, they did not present any documentary evidence to support the valuation they claimed for their residence and the personal property therein, to establish their adjusted basis for the residence and other items, to explain any insurance amounts that were paid or not paid, or to explain their failure to claim the loss until 2001. Further, Mr. Lockett admitted that he did not know the value and suggested that he had received some insurance reimbursement for the loss.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-7\">Similarly, the Locketts submitted pictures of the foreclosure of their real estate and eviction of their personal property that they characterized as a theft and destruction of their property. However, the theft claim form submitted to prove theft related to a theft alleged to have occurred in June 2003, which was not the year in which the theft losses were claimed. Moreover, the record shows that they were lawfully foreclosed upon for failure to pay their mortgage resulting in their eviction in 2001. Because foreclosure and eviction are not criminal acts, the Locketts did not demonstrate that they were victims of theft for purposes of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 165(c).</p>\n<p id=\"b490-9\">With regard to business losses and deductions, Mr. Lockett admitted that some of the deductions were incorrect. He suggested that he claimed business losses based on his inability to work while incarcerated for 22 months during the applicable period. Due to his incarceration and lack of sales activity, Mr. Lockett did not demonstrate that he was carrying on a trade or business during the applicable tax years to deduct expenses under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 262(a). Further, he failed to demonstrate, as required, that any amounts he paid or incurred during the claimed year were necessary or ordinary.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-10\">Lastly, the Locketts did not offer any documentary evidence or testimony to support the incurrence of $41,952.00 in moving expenses during 2002. Mr. Lockett\u2019s testimony supports that conclusion that he and his family moved in September 2001 because they were foreclosed upon, not due to new employment.</p>\n<p id=\"b490-11\">In summary, the Locketts failed to present credible evidence to substantiate the deductions they claimed for tax years 2001, 2002, and 2003 in order to overcome the presumption that the IRS had correctly determined the tax deficiencies. <em>See Gatlin, </em>754 F.2d at 923; <em>Webb, </em>872 F.2d at <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"469\">*469</page-number>381. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Tax Court.</p>\n<p id=\"b491-5\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b487-12\">. We liberally construe <em>pro se </em>pleadings and briefs. <em>See Finch v. City of Vernon, </em>877 F.2d 1497, 1504 (11th Cir. 1989).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b487-13\">. The Locketts also challenge the Tax Court's refusal to issue an order to enforce an agreement allegedly reached in a separate federal district court civil action. However, issuance of such an order would have exceeded the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction. <em>See </em>26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7429. Additionally, the Locketts request review of the Tax Court\u2019s denial of their motion for summary judgment. However, review of a motion for summary judgment is not appropriate where, as here, a judgment is entered following a full trial of the merits. <em>Lind v. United Parcel Service, Inc., </em>254 F.3d 1281, 1284 (11th Cir.2001).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b488-7\">. In <em>Bonner v. City of Prichard, Ala., </em>661 F.2d 1206, 1209 (11th Cir. 1981) <em>(en banc), </em>we adopted as binding precedent decisions of the <em>former </em>Fifth Circuit issued before October 1, 1981.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
