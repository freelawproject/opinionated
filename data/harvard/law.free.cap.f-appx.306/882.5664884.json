Lawler failed to properly and timely effect service, and the district court dismissed his suit for want of prosecution. Lawler appeals that dismissal. He argues that the dismissal of his suit was improper because his pro se status has resulted in several barriers to service and that the district court should have aided him in his attempts to serve the defendants. Lawler has not shown that the district court abused its discretion by dismissing his suit. <em>See Systems Signs Supplies v. United States Dep\u2019t of Justice, </em>903 F.2d 1011,1013 (5th Cir.1990). Consequently, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b904-18\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5ti-i Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
