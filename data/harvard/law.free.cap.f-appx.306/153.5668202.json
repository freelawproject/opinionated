Harris contended that he had been held in custody for 41 days too long due to a time-calculation error and that he brought this error to the attention of officials who refused to correct it. Harris subsequently sought leave to file an amended complaint to add two new defendants to his suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-15\">The district court determined that Harris\u2019s claim was barred by Eleventh Amendment immunity and <em>Heck v. Humphrey, </em>512 U.S. 477, 486-87, 114 S.Ct. 2364, 129 L.Ed.2d 383 (1994). The district court concomitantly determined that Harris\u2019s motion to amend was futile. The district court dismissed Harris\u2019s suit as frivolous and denied his motion to amend. Harris now appeals that judgment. We review both the dismissal of Harris\u2019s suit as frivolous and the denial of his motion to amend for an abuse of discretion. <em>Lowrey v. Texas A &amp; M University System, </em>117 F.3d 242, 245 (5th Cir.1997); <em>Siglar v. Hightower, </em>112 F.3d 191, 193 (5th Cir.1997).</p>\n<p id=\"b176-16\">Harris argues that the district court should have granted his motion to amend because it was timely filed and because he raised valid claims against the two individuals whom he wished to add as defendants. Harris also argues that the defendants are not entitled to qualified immunity because they should have known that they were violating his rights by keeping him incarcerated beyond his proper release date.</p>\n<p id=\"b176-17\">Harris does not address the issues whether the district court erred by concluding that his claim was barred by Eleventh Amendment immunity and <em>Heck, </em>nor does he analyze the propriety of the dis<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"155\">*155</page-number>trict court\u2019s corresponding determination that his motion to amend was futile because his claim was barred by <em>Heck </em>and Eleventh Amendment immunity. Harris has thus abandoned these issues. <em>See Yohey v. Collins, </em>985 F.2d 222, 224-25 (5th Cir.1993); <em>Brinkmann v. Dallas County Deputy Sheriff Abner, </em>813 F.2d 744, 748 (5th Cir.1987).</p>\n<p id=\"b177-5\">Harris has failed to show that the district court erred by dismissing his suit as frivolous and denying his motion to amend. Consequently, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b176-13\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has _ determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
