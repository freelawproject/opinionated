Ganun, </em>547 F.3d 46, 47 (1st Cir.2008) (per curiam). As recognized by the district court, defendant was statutorily ineligible for a sentence reduction under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(2) because his guideline range was based on the career offender guideline rather than the crack guideline and therefore was not \u201cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered\u201d by the recent crack cocaine amendments. <em>United States v. Ayala-Pizarro, </em>551 F.3d 84, 85 (1st Cir.2008); <em>United States v. Caraballo, </em>552 F.3d 6,11-12 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b644-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"622\">*622</page-number>Accordingly, the district court\u2019s order denying a sentence reduction is <em>affirmed.</em></p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b643-19\">. Amendment 706, effective November 1, 2007, reduced the base offense levels for crack offenses by two levels. Amendment 713, effective March 3, 2008, made amendment 706 retroactive.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
