Kenrick appeals the length of the term of supervised release authorized by the plea agreement.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b817-4\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"795\">*795</page-number>ii.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-5\">In May 2002, Kenrick began chatting with the victim, who was then 13 years old, in an internet chat room. Kenrick and the victim chatted on a frequent basis for approximately two years, and in 2004, having proposed marriage, Kenrick traveled to Pennsylvania to see her. He soon began living in the victim\u2019s home, giving her family cash, furniture, and other valuable gifts. During this time, he engaged in some sexual contact with the victim, apparently short of sexual intercourse. Kenrick was eventually told by the victim\u2019s parents to leave the victim alone, and he responded by threatening the victim\u2019s mother and falsely claiming to be a member of the armed forces and a police officer. Kenrick was apprehended in October 2004 and indicted for violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2423(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-6\">Pursuant to a plea agreement entered on July 7, 2005, Kenrick pled guilty to the charged offense. He was sentenced to 46 months imprisonment, followed by a life term of supervised release. Kenrick appealed the length and conditions of the supervised release and this court vacated the supervised release condition, holding, <em>inter alia, </em>that the District Court gave insufficient reasons for the imposition of the life term.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-7\">On remand, the District Court again sentenced Kenrick to a life term of supervised release, and Kenrick again appeals. This court exercises de novo review over the enforcement and interpretation of plea agreements, and Kenrick must prove a breach of the Plea Agreement by a preponderance of the evidence. <em>United States v. Williams, </em>510 F.3d 416, 424 (3d Cir.2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b817-8\">III.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-9\">A brief overview of the relevant Plea Agreement provisions is necessary before analyzing the issues raised in Kenrick\u2019s appeal. Paragraph C.l of the Plea Agreement states, \u201c[t]he penalty that may be imposed upon Derrick Kenrick is: ... (c) A term of supervised release of up to life, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3583(k).\u201d App. at 75-76. Paragraph C.3 of the Plea Agreement states, \u201c[t]he parties stipulate that the November 1, 2004, Sentencing Guidelines are applicable in this case.\u201d Lastly, paragraph C.4 states, \u201c[t]he parties agree that a sentence at the upper end of the guideline range is reasonable in this case.\u201d App. at 76.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-11\">The gravamen of Kenrick\u2019s claim is that the Plea Agreement does not authorize a life term of supervised release because the term \u201csentence,\u201d as it appears in paragraph C.4 of the Plea Agreement, refers only to imprisonment, not supervised release. However, the plain language of the plea agreement supports the District Court\u2019s conclusion that the parties agreed to a life term of supervised release. Plea agreements are analyzed under contract law standards, <em>United States v. Nolan-Cooper, </em>155 F.3d 221, 236 (3d Cir.1998), and, therefore, this court must \u201cexamine the plain meaning of the agreement itself and construe any ambiguities in the agreement against the government as drafter.\u201d <em>Williams, </em>510 F.3d at 424-25.</p>\n<p id=\"b817-12\">There is no ambiguity regarding Ken-rick\u2019s \u201csentence,\u201d nor does Kenrick proffer any other reasonable interpretation of that term. A \u201csentence\u201d encompasses many forms of punishment, including imprisonment and supervised release, and Kenrick cannot point to any language in the Plea Agreement indicating otherwise. Likewise, it strains common understanding to restrict the term \u201csentence\u201d to mean only the length of imprisonment. <em>See </em>The American Heritage College Dictionary 1242 (defining \u201csentence\u201d as \u201ca judicial decision of the punishment to be inflicted on one adjudged guilty\u201d) (3d ed.1993).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"796\">*796</page-number>Moreover, in paragraph C.l, Kenrick and the government agreed that the \u201cpenalty\u201d to be imposed on Kenrick includes (a) imprisonment; (b) a fine; (c) supervised release; (d) a special assessment; and (e) mandatory restitution. Because Kenrick\u2019s \u201cpenalty,\u201d by agreement, encompasses supervised release, the term \u201csentence,\u201d which is after all the penalty, necessarily does as well.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-4\">After a careful reading of the Plea Agreement, it is evident that the Plea Agreement is unambiguous and the term \u201csentence\u201d was intended to encompass more than just the length of imprisonment. Supervised release is a part of Kenrick\u2019s \u201csentence\u201d and the guidelines not only authorize a court to impose a life sentence of supervised release for sex offenses but expressly recommend it. U.S.S.G. \u00a7 5D1.2 (Policy Statement) (\u201cIf the instant offense of conviction is a sex offense, however, the statutory maximum term of supervised release is recommended.\u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b818-5\">Finally, when this case was before us previously we remanded this issue, saying</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AOn\">While we are mindful that the 2004 Sentencing Guidelines expressly provide for the possibility of a lifetime term of supervised release for Kenrick\u2019s offense, inasmuch as the district court did not provide adequate reasons for its decision, we also will vacate this provision of the sentence and remand the case so that the court may reconsider this issue during Kenrick\u2019s resentencing as well.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AYWRJ\"><em>United States v. Kenrick, </em>241 Fed.Appx. 10, 17-18 (3d Cir.2007). On resentencing, the District Court stated, <em>inter alia, </em>that (1) the maximum life term of supervised release \u201ccounterbalances the otherwise too lenient term of imprisonment\u201d to which the parties agreed; (2) the victim was only 13 years old when Kenrick contacted her; (3) he worked to meet other young girls on internet chat rooms and deceived them to garner their sympathy; (4) he threatened the victim\u2019s mother; and (5) lifetime supervision is the recommended term of supervised release for sex offenders such as Kenrick. We note that we are satisfied that the District Court provided adequate reasons for imposing a life term of supervised release on remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-7\">IV.</p>\n<p id=\"b818-8\">For the above mentioned reasons, we will affirm the District Court\u2019s sentence of a life term of supervised release.</p>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b816-26\">. This court has jurisdiction over this appeal pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
