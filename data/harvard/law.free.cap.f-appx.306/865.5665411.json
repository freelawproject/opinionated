He argues that the district court erred by denying him an acceptance of responsibility reduction to his offense level under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3E1.1 (2007). The district court denied the downward adjustment because of Huckabee\u2019s use of drugs while on pretrial release. The district court\u2019s determination that Huckabee\u2019s drug use was inconsistent with the acceptance of responsibility is not without foundation and not error, plain or otherwise. <em>See United States v. Juarez-Duarte, </em>513 F.3d 204, 211 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>-U.S.-, 128 S.Ct. 2452, 171 L.Ed.2d 248 (2008); <em>United States v. Watkins, </em>911 F.2d 983, 984-85 (5th Cir.1990).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-29\">Huckabee argues that his trial counsel provided him with ineffective assistance because counsel did not object to the presentence investigation report or the lack of a level reduction for acceptance of responsibility. \u201cThe general rule in this circuit is that a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel cannot be resolved on direct appeal when the claim has not been raised before the district court since no opportunity existed to develop the record on the merits of the allegations.\u201d <em>United States v. Higdon, </em>832 F.2d 312, 313-14 (5th Cir. 1987). Huckabee\u2019s argument is not reviewable on direct appeal in this case because the record is not sufficiently developed on the issue. We decline to address this claim of ineffective assistance on direct appeal without prejudice to Huckabee\u2019s right to bring it in a 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2255 proceeding. <em>See United States v. Gulley, </em>526 F.3d 809, 821 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 129 S.Ct. 159, 172 L.Ed.2d 116 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b888-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"866\">*866</page-number>For these reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED. The Government\u2019s motion to supplement the record is GRANTED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b887-23\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir.
