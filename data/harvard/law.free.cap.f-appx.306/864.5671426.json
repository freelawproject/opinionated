Estrada-Montalvo argues that the district court erroneously believed that it lacked the authority to vary from the advisory guidelines range based on the Government\u2019s refusal to move for an additional level decrease under U.S.S.G. \u00a7 3El.l(b). The district court\u2019s decision not to grant a variance does not indicate that it believed that it lacked the authority to impose a non-guidelines sentence. The totality of the circumstances reveals that the district court denied the requested variance because it believed that a within guidelines sentence was appropriate. <em>See United States v. Newson, </em>515 F.3d 374, 379 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014\u2014 U.S.\u2014\u2014 , 128 S.Ct. 2522,171 L.Ed.2d 802 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b886-25\">Estrada-Montalvo argues that the case should be remanded for resentencing because the Government declined to file a motion for an additional level decrease under \u00a7 3El.l(b), amounting to an \u201cincorrect application of the Guidelines.\u201d We review the Government\u2019s refusal to move for the additional level decrease to determine whether that refusal was based on an unconstitutional motive or was not rationally related to a legitimate end. <em>See Newson, </em>515 F.3d at 378-79. Estrada-Montalvo does not argue that the Government\u2019s refusal to file the motion was based on an unconstitutional motive; a defendant\u2019s refusal to waive his right to appeal is a basis rationally related to the purposes of \u00a7 3El.l(b). <em>See id. </em>Estrada-Montalvo argues that the district court erred in refusing to award him the additional level decrease for acceptance of responsibility under \u00a7 3El.l(b), but, as he concedes, the argument is foreclosed by <em>Newson. See Newson, </em>515 F.3d at 378.</p>\n<p id=\"b886-26\">Estrada-Montalvo argues that the district court erred in assessing the 16-level crime of violence increase based on his prior conviction for burglary of a habi<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"865\">*865</page-number>tation in reliance on his Texas judicial confession, but, as he concedes, his argument challenging the district court\u2019s reliance on his judicial confession is foreclosed by <em>United States v. Garcia-Arellano, </em>522 F.3d 477, 481 (5th Cir.), <em>cert. denied, </em>\u2014 U.S.\u2014, 129 S.Ct. 353, 172 L.Ed.2d 138 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b887-7\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b886-19\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir.
