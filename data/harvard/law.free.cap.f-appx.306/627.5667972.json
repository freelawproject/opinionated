We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the underlying facts, the case\u2019s procedural history, and the issues on appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b649-25\">Reviewing for abuse of discretion, <em>United States v. Verkhoglyad, </em>516 F.3d 122, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"628\">*628</page-number>127 (2d Cir.2008), we do not find the district court\u2019s sentence to be procedurally unreasonable. A sentencing judge is not required to make any \u201cspecific verbal formulation[ ] ... to demonstrate the adequate discharge of the duty to \u2018consider\u2019 \u201d the factors of \u00a7 3553(a). <em>United States v. Fernandez, </em>443 F.3d 19, 30 (2d Cir.2006); <em>see Verkhoglyad, </em>516 F.3d at 129 (\u201c[T]he law does not impose \u2018any rigorous requirement of specific articulation\u2019 on sentencing judges with respect to their consideration of \u00a7 3553(a) factors.\u201d <em>(quoting United States v. Crosby, </em>397 F.3d 103, 113 (2d Cir.2005))). In this case, the sentencing transcript shows that the district court properly considered the \u00a7 3553(a) factors, and did provide an adequate explanation of the basis for its sentence. The court acknowledged that Tchiapchis was entitled to a downward departure \u2014 because of the cooperation agreement \u2014 but concluded upon consideration of Tchiapchis\u2019s criminal history that a smaller departure than requested was warranted.</p>\n<p id=\"b650-4\">Nor was the sentence substantively unreasonable. The final sentence was below the advisory guideline imprisonment range of 121 to 151 months, and Tchiapchis advances no argument explaining why that range, or his specific sentence below it, was substantively unreasonable. <em>Cf. United States v. Eberhard, </em>525 F.3d 175, 179 (2d Cir.2008) (\u201cAlthough we do not presume that a Guidelines sentence is reasonable, we have recognized that \u2018in the overwhelming majority of cases, a Guidelines sentence will fall comfortably within the broad range of sentences that would be reasonable in the particular circumstances.\u2019 \u201d).</p>\n<p id=\"b650-5\">For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
