We assume the parties\u2019 familiarity with the facts and procedural history.</p>\n<p id=\"b727-5\">We review orders granting summary judgment <em>de novo </em>and focus on whether the district court properly concluded that there was no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>See Miller v. Wolpoff &amp; Abramson, L.L.P., </em>321 F.3d 292, 300 (2d Cir.2003). Under New York\u2019s substantive law, a plaintiff may prevail on a claim of negligent design or strict products liability only if she can establish that the alleged defect was a \u201csubstantial factor\u201d in causing her injuries. <em>See Kosmynka v. Polaris Industries, Inc., </em>462 F.3d 74, 80, 86 (2d Cir.2006); <em>see also Fane v. Zimmer, Inc., </em>927 F.2d 124, 128 (2d Cir.1991); <em>Jarvis v. Ford Motor Co., </em>283 F.3d 33, 45 (2d Cir.2002) (citing <em>Gargano v. Rosenthal, </em>100 A.D.2d 534, 473 N.Y.S.2d 225, 227 (2d Dep\u2019t 1984), and <em>Hunter v. Ford Motor Co., </em>37 A.D.2d 335, 325 N.Y.S.2d 469, 471 (3d Dep\u2019t 1971)).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-6\">The Alaimos were required to prove a causal link between use of the inhaler at issue and the injury, i.e., exacerbation of Minette\u2019s condition, by use of expert testimony. \u201cOrdinarily, expert medical opinion evidence ... is required, when the subject-matter to be inquired about is presumed not to be within common knowledge and experience....\u201d <em>Fane, </em>927 F.2d at 131 (internal quotation marks omitted). Under Federal Rule of Evidence 702:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b727-7\">If scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise, if (1) the testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data, (2) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods, and (3) the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b727-9\">Expert opinion \u201crequires some explanation as to how the expert came to his conclusion and what methodologies or evidence substantiate that conclusion.\u201d <em>Riegel v. Medtronic, Inc., </em>451 F.3d 104, 127 (2d Cir.2006), <em>aff'd on other grounds, </em>\u2014 U.S. -, 128 S.Ct. 999, 169 L.Ed.2d 892 (2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b727-12\">Here, Nurse Krivit\u2019s statement could not satisfy the requirements of expert testimony. <em>See Riegel, </em>451 F.3d at 127. Moreover, even if Nurse Krivit and Dr. Rodrigues could qualify as experts, their testimony did not establish any causal link between the allegedly defective inhaler and injury to Minette. First, Nurse Krivit\u2019s opinion was based solely on her personal observations of Minette, and she failed to explain the basis or methodologies for arriving at the conclusion that the inhaler led to a worsening of Minette\u2019s asthma. Dr. Rodrigues, who repeatedly indicated that he was not an expert, stated at most that there was a temporal link between the exacerbation of Minette\u2019s symptoms and her use of the inhaler. Equally as important, he repeatedly refused to draw a direct causal link between use of the recalled inhaler and Minette\u2019s condition, acknowledging that there were numerous other factors that could have led to a worsening of Minette\u2019s asthma. Thus, reading the evidence and record in the light most favorable to the Alaimos, the district court correctly granted summary judgment to 3M and Rite Aid. <em>See Miller, </em>321 F.3d at 300.</p>\n<p id=\"b728-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"706\">*706</page-number>We have reviewed appellants\u2019 remaining arguments and find them to be without merit. For the reasons stated above, the judgment of the district court is AFFIRMED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
