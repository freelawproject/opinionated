Based on several prior convictions, the presentence report calculated a criminal history category of V. At sentencing, the district court determined that the applicable offense level was 18; the recommended guidelines range was therefore 51-63 months\u2019 imprisonment. Because the court found that category V understated the seriousness of Rosario\u2019s criminal history, however, it made an upward departure to criminal history category VI,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> resulting in a new guidelines range of 57-71 months. The court then sentenced Rosario to 71 months.</p>\n<p id=\"b98-14\">Rosario appeals on the ground that he did not receive the required pre-sentencing warning that the court was contemplating an upward departure. He did not raise that objection in the district court, however, so we review only for plain error. Fed.R.CrimP. 52(b).</p>\n<p id=\"b98-15\">To prove plain error, Rosario must \u201cshow (1) there was error, (2) the eri'or was plain, (3) the error affected his \u2018substantial rights,\u2019 and (4) the error seriously affected \u2018the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\u2019 \u201d <em>United States v. </em>Jones, 489 F.3d 679, 681 (5th Cir.2007) (quoting <em>United States v. Olano, </em>507 U.S. 725, 732, 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993)). And to satisfy the \u201csubstantial rights\u201d prong, \u201cin most cases ... the error must have been prejudicial: It must have affected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\u201d <em>Olano, </em>507 U.S. at 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770. Further, \u201c[i]t is the defendant rather than the Government who bears the burden of persuasion with respect to prejudice.\u201d <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b98-16\">If a district court is contemplating a departure \u201con a ground not identified for departure either in the presentence report or in a party\u2019s prehearing submission, the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"77\">*77</page-number>court must give the parties reasonable notice that it is contemplating such a departure.\u201d Fed.R.Crim.P. 82(h). We considered whether failure to give such notice was plain error in <em>United States v. Jones, </em>444 F.3d 430, 443 (5th Cir.2006). There, the defendant claimed that the lack of notice prevented him from raising an objection to the upward departure. We found that even if the objection had been made, it was not \u201creasonably probable that the district court would have chosen a lesser sentence----\u201d <em>Id. </em>We therefore affirmed, because the defendant had not demonstrated prejudice. <em>Id.</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b99-6\">Although the court erred when it did not give notice of the potential departure,<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> Rosario has not borne his burden of persuasion with respect to prejudice. Specifically, he has failed to show (or even argue) that the error affected the <em>outcome </em>\u2014 ie., that he would have received a lower sentence had the district court properly given notice.</p>\n<p id=\"b99-7\">The judgment of sentence is therefore AFFIRMED.</p>\n<footnote label=\"**\">\n<p id=\"b98-11\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b98-12\">. Rosario argues that raising \"the criminal history category from V lo VI based on additional information does not constitute an upward departure under the definition from the Guidelines Manual.\u201d That is incorrect. If a district court determines that \"the defendant\u2019s criminal history category substantially under-represents the seriousness of the defendant\u2019s criminal history ..., an upward departure may be warranted.\" U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3(a)(l) (2004). Further, the term \"upward departure\u201d in \u00a7 4A 1.3 is given the same definition as it is elsewhere in the guidelines. <em>See </em>U.S.S.G. \u00a7 4A1.3 cmt. n. 1 (2004) (cross-referencing general guidelines definitions for the term \"upward departure\u201d).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"2\">\n<p id=\"b99-9\">. <em>See also United States v. Smith, </em>295 Fed.Appx. 611, 613-14 (5th Cir.2007) (per curiam) (unpublished) (affirming sentence where evidence defendant would have presented if given notice \"would [not] have changed the sentence given by the district judge\"), <em>cert, </em>denied,-U.S.-, 127 S.Ct. 2280, 167 L.Ed.2d 1114 (2007).</p>\n</footnote>\n<footnote label=\"3\">\n<p id=\"b99-29\">. We reject the government\u2019s argument that \u201cnotice was not required because the district court did not contemplate, nor did it impose, a sentence outside of the applicable Guidelines range.\" The government apparently read the guidelines table to provide a range of 57-71 months for a total offense level of 18 and a criminal history score of V. In fact, the table provides for 51-63 months.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
