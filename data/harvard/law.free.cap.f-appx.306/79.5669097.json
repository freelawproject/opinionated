The presentence report (PSR) recommended a base offense level of eight pursuant to U.S.S.G. \u00a7 2L1.2(a) and an increase of eight levels pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C) based upon his previous Arizona conviction for Aggravated Driving Under the Influence (DUI). Chaeon-Mar<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"80\">*80</page-number>quez argues that the district court erred in treating his Arizona conviction for Aggravated DUI federal drug conviction as an \u201caggravated felony\u201d under \u00a7 2L1.2.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-4\">Pursuant to \u00a7 2L1.2(b)(l)(C), a defendant\u2019s base offense level for the conviction of illegal reentry is enhanced by eight levels if the defendant has previously been convicted for an \u201caggravated felony.\u201d \u201cFor the purposes of subsection (b)(1)(C), \u2018aggravated felony\u2019 has the meaning given that term in section 101(a)(43) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)), without regard to the date of conviction for the aggravated felony.\u201d \u00a7 2L1.2, comment. (n.3(A)). Section 1101 provides, in pertinent part, that crimes of violence as defined under 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16 constitute aggravated felonies. \u00a7 1101(a)(43)(F). In <em>United, States v. Chapa-Garza, </em>243 F.3d 921, 927 (5th Cir. 2001), this court held that a felony DUI was not a crime of violence as defined by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-5\">The Government has confessed error on this point and requests that the sentence be vacated and the case remanded for resentencing. We agree. The Government\u2019s motion to vacate and remand is GRANTED. The Government\u2019s motions for dismissal or summary affirmance and extension of time are DENIED.</p>\n<p id=\"b102-6\">Chacon-Marquez\u2019s sentence is VACATED, and the case is REMANDED to the district court for resentencing. As Chacon-Marquez\u2019s sentence has been vacated there is no need to discuss or preserve any other issues related to that sentence.</p>\n<footnote label=\"*\">\n<p id=\"b101-22\"> Pursuant to 5th Cir. R. 47.5, the court has determined that this opinion should not be published and is not precedent except under the limited circumstances set forth in 5th Cir. R. 47.5.4.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
