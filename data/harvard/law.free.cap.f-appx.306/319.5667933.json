The immigration judge concluded that Benabbi\u2019s asylum application was time-barred, and denied his application for withholding of removal after finding that he had not established past persecution or a clear probability of future persecution. The BIA affirmed, and Benabbi petitions for review of his application for withholding of removal. Because the record does not compel the conclusion that Benabbi more likely than not will be persecuted if he returns to Algeria, we deny the petition.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-5\">Benabbi entered the United States as a tourist in June 1999 and when his visa expired three years later, he remained, and was placed in removal proceedings. Benabbi applied for asylum and withholding of removal on the basis of his Berber ethnicity, political opinion, and membership in a particular social group, namely \u201cthe pro-western group of Berbers who oppose the imposition of Islamic regime.\u201d Berbers are an ethnic minority comprising roughly one-third of the Algerian population, and, according to Benabbi, they are identifiable by their light skin and hair. Benabbi presented evidence that Berbers are associated with \u201cwestern\u201d values and secular culture and consequently are targeted by the Islamic fundamentalist movement in Algeria.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-6\">At his removal hearing, Benabbi testified that he operated a wholesale merchandise business in Kabylia, a Berber enclave approximately 100 miles from his home in Algiers. Benabbi testified that \u201con many occasions,\u201d self-described \u201crevolutionary people\u201d solicited him at his business and threatened to kill him when he refused to give them money for \u201cthe revolution.\u201d Although the men did not identify themselves as such, Benabbi testified without elaboration that he believes they were from the terrorist group GIA <em>(\u201cGroupe Islamique Arm\u00e9 </em>\u201d). According to Benabbi, he refused to give the terrorists money because he is \u201ccategorically against\u201d their anti-western, anti-democratic ideology. He did not specify whether he voiced these beliefs to the men or simply declined to give them money.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-8\">Although Benabbi testified generally that the terrorists asked him for money and threatened him \u201cmany times,\u201d when pressed he could recall only two such encounters. Once, in the summer or fall of 1998, he said, two men came to his business and asked him for money, but he refused. A second incident, he said, occurred at a caf\u00e9 near his business, where different terrorists asked him for money and again he refused. Benabbi did not elaborate on either encounter, but admitted that he was never harmed. He also testified that he was never threatened by terrorists at his home in Algiers.</p>\n<p id=\"b342-9\">As a result of these encounters, Benabbi explained, he decided to abandon his business, and within a year he traveled to the United States. Benabbi testified that he is afraid to return to Algeria because, since he refused to give the terrorists money, \u201cthey have my name, and I\u2019m on the list, so they may kill me.\u201d Benabbi testified that he speaks to his family in Algeria weekly and they warn him not to return because it is \u201ctoo dangerous\u201d for him there. But when asked to elaborate, Benabbi only reiterated that terrorists target \u201cprowestern\u201d people and his name is on \u201cthe list.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b342-10\">The IJ found Benabbi\u2019s asylum application time-barred because he did not file it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"321\">*321</page-number>within a year of arriving in the United States. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1158(a)(2)(B). Turning to Benabbi\u2019s application for withholding, the IJ fully credited Benabbi\u2019s testimony, but found that Benabbi\u2019s experiences did not rise to the level of past persecution, noting that \u201che was asked for money, he was not threatened with any weapon, he refused to provide these men money, and left without being harmed.\u201d The IJ also noted that Benabbi had not presented any evidence that he was targeted because he is Berber. The IJ thus concluded that Benabbi had not demonstrated a clear probability of future persecution. The BIA agreed.</p>\n<p id=\"b343-5\">In his petition for review, Benabbi challenges only the denial of his application for withholding of removal. Where, as here, the Board affirms the IJ\u2019s decision in a brief order, this court reviews the IJ\u2019s decision as supplemented by the Board. <em>See Bosede v. Mukasey, </em>512 F.3d 946, 950 (7th Cir.2008). We will uphold the agency\u2019s decision denying withholding of removal so long as it is supported by substantial evidence, and will overturn it \u201conly if the record compels a contrary result.\u201d <em>Mema v. Gonzales, </em>474 F.3d 412, 416 (7th Cir .2007).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-6\">To qualify for withholding of removal, an applicant must demonstrate a clear probability (\u201cmore likely than not\u201d) of future persecution on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership in a social group, or political opinion. <em>See </em>8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1231(b)(3)(A), (C); <em>Irasoc v. Mukasey, </em>522 F.3d 727, 729-30 (7th Cir.2008). If the applicant establishes that he suffered past persecution, as Benabbi attempts to do here, he is entitled to a rebuttable presumption of future persecution. <em>See Guardia v. Mukasey, </em>526 F.3d 968, 971 (7th Cir.2008).</p>\n<p id=\"b343-7\">Benabbi first argues that the IJ should have found that he suffered past persecution because he was \u201cthreatened with assassination\u201d by \u201cextortionists\u201d when he refused to support their cause. He emphasizes that his subjective fear was so strong that he abandoned his business \u201cfor the sake of saving his life,\u201d and cites U.S. Department of State Country Reports stating that terrorists often carry out violent reprisals against businessmen who refuse to pay them a \u201ctax.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b343-9\">To constitute persecution, conduct must rise above \u201cmere harassment.\u201d <em>Prela v. Ashcroft, </em>394 F.3d 515, 518 (7th Cir.2005). And unfulfilled threats will qualify as persecution \u201conly in the most extreme circumstances, such as where they are of a most immediate or menacing nature or if the perpetrators attempt to follow through on the threat.\u201d <em>Bejko v. Gonzales, </em>468 F.3d 482, 486 (7th Cir.2006). Although Benabbi testified that terrorists \u201cthreatened\u201d him on numerous occasions, when asked to elaborate, he described two unremarkable and apparently unrelated encounters in which men merely requested money for \u201cthe revolution\u201d and left him unharmed when he declined. Benabbi asserts generally that these encounters caused him to abandon his business, but he did not testify that the terrorists threatened to return or even exchanged any words with him beyond asking for money. In evaluating whether an applicant has suffered persecution, the IJ is entitled to take into account the applicant\u2019s failure to provide sufficient detail, and need not defer to the applicant\u2019s unsupported assertions of endangerment. <em>See Ahmed v. Ashcroft, </em>348 F.3d 611, 615-16 (7th Cir.2003); <em>Dandan v. Ashcroft, </em>339 F.3d 567, 574 (7th Cir.2003). Here, the generalized, subjective evidence that Benabbi presented would barely compel the conclusion that he was harassed, let alone persecuted. Accordingly, the IJ\u2019s conclusion that Benabbi did not suffer past <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"322\">*322</page-number>persecution is supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-4\">Benabbi also argues that, even if he has. not established past persecution, he has demonstrated a clear probability of future persecution because, he believes, \u201che was put on the assassination list, and upon his return to Algeria his old enemies would try to kill him.\u201d But Benabbi has failed to demonstrate that his subjective fear of future persecution is objectively reasonable. <em>See Zheng v. Gonzales, </em>409 F.3d 804, 809 (7th Cir.2005). He did not elaborate on this \u201cassassination list\u201d in his testimony, nor did he suggest that any terrorists' could identify him, let alone consider him an \u201cenemy.\u201d Although Benabbi testified that his family warns him that Algeria is \u201ctoo dangerous\u201d for him, those warnings are too generalized to be probative of future persecution. Furthermore, Benabbi\u2019s former business is 100 miles away from his home town, Algiers, and he admits that terrorists never confronted him at home during the year preceding his departure. Thus, he presented no evidence showing that terrorists sought him back in 1999 or would seek him today.</p>\n<p id=\"b344-6\">Because Benabbi\u2019s evidence falls far short of compelling a finding that he will more likely than not face persecution if returned to Algeria, the petition for review is DENIED.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
