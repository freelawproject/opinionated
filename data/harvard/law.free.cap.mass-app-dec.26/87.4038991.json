J.</em>\n</author>\n<p id=\"AbQ\">The report of the trial judge in this case appears inadequate as a record of the proceedings in the district court to enable us to determine whether there was any prejudicial error.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-9\">There is virtually no statement or summary of the evidence adduced at the trial. It fails to state in detail and accurately the rulings given or refused by which the party (plaintiff) claims to be aggrieved. The declaration alleges a written contract, but no copy of the same is annexed or set out.</p>\n<p id=\"b94-10\">The report is also objectionable as to form. It is unnecessarily encumbered by a verbatim statement of the declaration and the answer (the substance of the pleadings is sufficient). It contains contentions, argumentation and irrelevent matters. It concludes as follows \u201c. . . The plaintiffs, claiming to be aggrieved by the court\u2019s ruling, and his contradictory finding, <em>they </em>hereby report same to the Appellate Division for determination.\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"89\">*89</page-number>It is the judge who reports the case and not the party. <em>Perry v.
