Barbara also appeals the District Court\u2019s denial of her motions for summary judgment and for judgment as a matter of law.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Union Fidelity cross- appeals. We affirm in part, reverse in part and remand for further proceedings consistent with this Opinion.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-9\">\u00b62 For purposes of clarity, we have separated the two issues Barbara raised on appeal into the following three issues:</p>\n<p id=\"b182-10\">\u00b63 1. Whether the District Court erred in denying Barbara\u2019s motions for summary judgment and for judgment as a matter of law upon her claim that Union Fidelity breached its insuring agreement by rejecting her claim for benefits and rescinding her Certificate of Insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-11\">\u00b64 2. Whether the District Court erred in admitting into evidence at trial Clarence\u2019s medical records acquired by Union Fidelity after Barbara\u2019s claim had been denied and her certificate of insurance rescinded.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-12\">\u00b65 3. Whether the District Court erred in instructing the jury that Clarence\u2019s opinion as to the condition of his health was to be determined under both subjective and objective tests.</p>\n<p id=\"b182-13\">\u00b66 In addition, Union Fidelity raised the following three issues on cross-appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b183-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"163\">*163</page-number>\u00b67 4. Whether the District Court erred by denying Union Fidelity\u2019s motions for summary judgment and for judgment as a matter of law on Barbara\u2019s claims of fraud and bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-4\">\u00b68 5. Whether the District Court erred by granting Barbara\u2019s motion <em>in limine </em>precluding Union Fidelity from presenting evidence about Barbara\u2019s and Clarence\u2019s bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-5\">\u00b69 6. Whether the District Court erred by failing to give Union Fidelity\u2019s instruction setting forth its defense theory.</p>\n<p id=\"b183-6\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b183-7\">\u00b610 On December 7, 1996, Barbara and Clarence purchased a new pickup from Archie Cochrane Motors in Billings. As part of the deal, Barbara and Clarence purchased credit life insurance. The application for credit life coverage was incorporated into the Certificate of Insurance sold by Archie Cochrane Motors on behalf of Union Fidelity. It provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-8\">I hereby certify that I am in good health and am not under treatment for, or receiving medical advice for any illness, disease, or physical or mental impairment. In addition, I have not been diagnosed as having Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS), AIDS Related Complex, or tested positive for antibodies to the AIDS virus....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-9\">I make the above certifications with the intent of inducing Union Fidelity Life Insurance Company to issue this certificate of insurance. I understand that: ... (b) any untruthful answer or misrepresentation may be a basis for a denial of benefits or the voiding of this certificate of insurance.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-10\">\u00b611 While the application does not define \u201cgood health,\u201d Union Fidelity\u2019s Credit Insurance Manual states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-11\">Quite often, the question, \u2018WHAT IS GOOD HEALTH?\u201d is asked of the home office. Although opinions vary slightly, it is generally agreed that a person in good health is:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-12\">\u2022 Free from serious disease that could be expected to cause health problems in the foreseeable future.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-13\">\u2022 Able to perform the usual activities of a person of like age and build.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b183-14\">\u2022 Capable of working at least 30 hours per week.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b183-15\">There is no place on Union Fidelity\u2019s form to include detailed medical information. In addition, no additional forms, health questions, medical examinations, medical tests, medical screenings or authorizations for release of medical information are part of the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"164\">*164</page-number>application process. Once the Certificate of Insurance is signed by the applicant, credit life insurance coverage is issued, on the spot, by the dealership. Both Clarence and Barbara signed the application on December 7,1996.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-4\">\u00b612 Clarence died on September 20, 1997, and Barbara submitted a claim for death benefits to Union Fidelity totaling $34,000. The file was assigned to a claims analyst who requested copies of Clarence\u2019s past medical records. The death certificate had identified, as an underlying cause of death, \u201crenal cell carcinoma with metastasis\u201d which had existed for \u201cyears.\u201d On December 16, 1997, Union Fidelity denied the claim for benefits and rescinded the Certificate of Insurance on the basis that Clarence had misrepresented his health.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-5\">\u00b613 On June 21, 1999, Barbara filed a civil action against Union Fidelity and Archie Cochrane Motors, as an agent of Union Fidelity, alleging breach of contract; fraud; breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing; and breach of Union Fidelity\u2019s statutory obligations under the Montana Insurance Code and the Montana Unfair Claim Settlement Practices Act, \u00a7 33-18-201, MCA. The parties subsequently stipulated to dismiss Archie Cochrane Motors from this action with prejudice and the court so ordered.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-6\">\u00b614 Upon completion of discovery, Union Fidelity moved for summary judgment on the grounds that Clarence provided false information that was material to Union Fidelity\u2019s decision to issue the insurance certificate, hence Union Fidelity rescinded the certificate. Union Fidelity argued that because it rescinded, there is no insurance contract and all of Barbara\u2019s claims against Union Fidelity fail as a matter of law. Thereafter, Barbara filed a Cross Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on her breach of contract claim. Barbara also alleged that Union Fidelity engaged in postclaim underwriting, an unfair trade practice prohibited by \u00a7 33-18-215, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-7\">\u00b615 After a hearing, the District Court denied Union Fidelity\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment as well as Barbara\u2019s Cross Motion for Partial Summary Judgment. The court determined that there were several genuine issues of material fact, including whether Clarence\u2019s signature on the credit application signifying that he was in good health was a material misrepresentation.</p>\n<p id=\"b184-8\">\u00b616 The parties proceeded to trial on May 20,2002. At the close of the evidence, Barbara moved for judgment as a matter of law in her favor on her breach of contract claim and Union Fidelity moved for judgment as a matter of law in its favor on Barbara\u2019s fraud and bad faith claims. The District Court denied both motions and submitted the case to the jury. The jury\u2019s verdict form instructed it to first determine whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"165\">*165</page-number>Union Fidelity breached its contract with Barbara; if the jury found no breach, it was to sign and return the verdict form without reaching Barbara\u2019s other claims. The jury returned a verdict in favor of Union Fidelity on the breach of contract claim. Barbara now appeals and Union Fidelity cross-appeals.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-4\">Issue 1.</p>\n<p id=\"b185-5\">\u00b617 <em>Whether the District Court erred in denying Barbara\u2019s motions for summary judgment and for judgment as a matter of law upon her claim that Union Fidelity breached its insuring agreement by rejecting her claim for benefits and rescinding her Certificate of Insurance.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b185-6\">\u00b618 Our standard of review in appeals from summary judgment rulings is <em>de novo. Wendell v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co., </em>1999 MT 17, \u00b6 9, 293 Mont. 140, \u00b6 9, 974 P.2d 623, \u00b6 9 (citing <em>Ruckdaschel v. State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. </em>(1997), 285 Mont. 395, 398, 948 P.2d 700, 702). We apply the same criteria applied by the district court pursuant to Rule 56(c), M.R.Civ.P. The moving party must establish both the absence of genuine issues of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. Once the moving party has met its burden, the opposing party must present material and substantial evidence, rather than mere conclusory or speculative statements, to raise a genuine issue of material fact. <em>Hanson v. Water Ski Mania Estates, </em>2005 MT 47, \u00b6 11, 326 Mont. 154, \u00b6 11, 108 P.3d 481, \u00b6 11 (citing <em>Fair Play Missoula v. City of Missoula, </em>2002 MT 179, \u00b6 12, 311 Mont. 22, \u00b6 12, 52 P.3d 926, \u00b6 12; <em>Enger v. City of Missoula, </em>2001 MT 142, \u00b6 10, 306 Mont. 28, \u00b6 10, 29 P.3d 514, \u00b6 10).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-7\">\u00b619 This Court\u2019s standard of review of appeals from district court orders granting or denying motions for judgment as a matter of law is identical to that of the district court. <em>Marie Deonier &amp; Assoc. v. Paul Revere Life Ins. Co., </em>2004 MT 297, \u00b6 18, 323 Mont. 387, \u00b6 18, 101 P.3d 742, \u00b6 18 (citing Durden <em>v. Hydro Flame Corp., </em>1998 MT 47, \u00b6 22, 288 Mont. 1, \u00b6 22, 955 P.2d 160, \u00b6 22; <em>Ryan v. City of Bozeman </em>(1996), 279 Mont. 507, 510, 928 P.2d 228, 229-30). Judgment as a matter of law is properly granted only when there is a complete absence of any evidence which would justify submitting an issue to a jury and all such evidence and any legitimate inferences that might be drawn from that evidence must be considered in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion. <em>Marie Deonier, </em>\u00b6 18 (citing <em>Bevacqua v. Union Pac. R.R. Co., </em>1998 MT 120, \u00b6 46, 289 Mont. 36, \u00b6 46, 960 P.2d 273, \u00b6 46; <em>Durden, </em>\u00b6 21).</p>\n<p id=\"b185-8\">\u00b620 Barbara argues on appeal that the District Court erred in failing <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"166\">*166</page-number>to hold Union Fidelity liable as a matter of law on her breach of contract claim because Union Fidelity engaged in postclaim underwriting which is statutorily prohibited as an unfair trade practice in Montana. Barbara maintains that during the application process, an insurer must require fact-specific information regarding the applicant\u2019s medical history that the insurer considers to be material and absent such rudimentary \u201cunderwriting,\u201d a material misrepresentation cannot occur as a matter of law. Barbara points out that Union Fidelity\u2019s application form did not require any fact-specific information regarding past medical history.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-4\">\u00b621 Union Fidelity argues that postclaim underwriting is not an independent claim in Montana and that even if Barbara could assert an independent postclaim underwriting claim, \u00a7 33-18-215, MCA, does not support her argument that she was entitled to judgment as a matter of law based solely on Union Fidelity\u2019s application form. Union Fidelity maintains that because Clarence made a material representation on the application form, Union Fidelity was entitled to rescind the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b186-5\">\u00b622 In 1997, the Montana Legislature amended Montana\u2019s Unfair Trade Practices Act (UTPA) and expressly prohibited postclaim underwriting.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-6\">Postclaim underwriting prohibited - condition. An insurer, health service corporation, or health maintenance organization may not place an elimination rider on or rescind coverage provided by a disability policy, certificate, or subscriber contract after a policy, certificate, or contract has been issued unless the insured has made <em>a material misrepresentation or fraudulent misstatement </em>on the application or has failed to pay the premium when due.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b186-8\">Section 33-18-215, MCA (emphasis added).</p>\n<p id=\"b186-9\">\u00b623 Moreover, \u00a7 33-15-403, MCA, allows an insurer to deny coverage when an applicant fails to provide truthful and accurate information:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-10\">Representations in applications - recovery precluded if fraudulent or material. (1) All statements and descriptions in any application for an insurance policy or annuity contract or in negotiations for an insurance policy or annuity contract by or on behalf of the insured or annuitant are considered representations and not warranties.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-11\">(2) Misrepresentations, omissions, concealment of facts, and incorrect statements do not prevent a recovery under the policy or contract unless:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b186-12\">(a) <em>fraudulent',</em></blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"167\">*167</page-number>(b) <em>material either to the acceptance of the risk or to the hazard assumed by the insurer', </em>or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b187-4\">(c) the insurer in good faith would either not have issued the policy or contract or would not have issued a policy or contract in as large an amount or at the same premium or rate or would not have provided coverage with respect to the hazard resulting in the loss if the true facts had been made known to the insurer as required either by the application for the policy or contract or otherwise. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b187-5\">\u00b624 In this case, Barbara contends that Union Fidelity\u2019s application was ambiguous because it did not define \u201cgood health,\u201d nor did it require information on past medical treatment. Union Fidelity argues that credit life insurance applications typically don\u2019t require as much information as other types of insurance. Moreover, Union Fidelity contends that its rates and contract terms are regulated and any ruling that Barbara was entitled to judgment as a matter of law based solely on Union Fidelity\u2019s application form would violate the \u201cfiled rate doctrine.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b187-6\">\u00b625 The filed rate doctrine arose from a concern that a deviation from a rate filed with a federal regulatory agency can result in the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions by a court of law without sufficient knowledge or expertise of the rate-setting process of a regulatory agency. The purpose of the filed rate doctrine is to ensure that rates are both reasonable and evenly applied. It initially applied to common carriers, but was expanded to include telephone services, utilities and insurance.</p>\n<p id=\"b187-7\">\u00b626 The filed rate doctrine originated in <em>Keogh v. Chicago &amp; N. W. RY. Co. </em>(1922), 260 U.S. 156, 43 S.Ct. 47, 67 L.Ed. 183, wherein the United States Supreme Court held that a private shipper could not recover treble damages against railway companies that had set rates that were filed with and approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC). The Supreme Court set forth two rationales for its holding. First, the regulatory scheme already allowed for the recovery of damages for illegal rates in proceedings before the ICC and, second, carrier rate regulation was primarily intended to prevent the charging of discriminatory rates. \u201cWhere damages are sought under a state law, [the filed rate doctrine] may apply if the challenged rates or prices were set by a <em>federal regulatory authority. See, e.g., Knevelbaard Dairies v. Kraft Foods Inc. </em>(9th Cir. 2000), 232 F.3d 979, 992 (emphasis added) (citations omitted). Furthermore, the filed rate doctrine bars both state and federal claims that attempt to challenge a <em>rate </em>that a <em>federal agency </em>has reviewed and filed. <em>County of Stanislaus v. Pacific </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"168\">*168</page-number><em>Gas &amp; Elec. Co. </em>(9th Cir. 1997), 114 F.3d 858, 866 (emphasis added), <em>cert. denied, </em>522 U.S. 1076, 118 S.Ct. 854, 139 L.Ed.2d 754 (1998).</p>\n<p id=\"AFO\">\u00b627 In an amicus brief filed in the case <em>sub judice, </em>the Office of the Montana State Auditor acting as Commissioner of Insurance for the State of Montana (the Commissioner), argued that the filed rate doctrine is not applicable in this case because the rate charged for the insurance is not contested. The Commissioner maintained that the filed rate doctrine has not been extended to include insurance forms approved by a state agency and that the Commissioner\u2019s regulatory authority does not, and should not, immunize or otherwise preclude a claim against an insurance company for a violation of state law.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-4\">\u00b628  In this case, there is no evidence that Union Fidelity\u2019s rates for credit life insurance were set, reviewed or filed by a federal regulatory authority. Hence, Union Fidelity is not immunized under the filed rate doctrine for a claim for violation of state law. Based on the foregoing, we hold that the filed rate doctrine is not applicable in this case and we reject Union Fidelity\u2019s argument in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-5\">\u00b629 Union Fidelity also argues that the Montana Legislature limited the claims that an insured may bring against an insurer when it enacted \u00a7 33-18-242, MCA, and under that statute, postclaim underwriting is not an independent claim. Section 33-18-242(3), MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b188-6\">An insured who has suffered damages as a result of the handling of an insurance claim may bring an action against the insurer for breach of the insurance contract, for fraud, or pursuant to this section, <em>but not under any other theory or cause of action. </em>An insured may not bring an action for bad faith in connection with the handling of an insurance claim. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b188-7\">\u00b630 Contrary to Union Fidelity\u2019s contentions, Barbara points out that she is not asserting that postclaim underwriting is an independent claim, only that it has bearing upon the facts of this case because the Legislature has seen fit to define and prohibit postclaim underwriting in \u00a7 33-18-215, MCA. Barbara contends that while this prohibition is relevant to her claims of bad faith, fraud and malice, it bears most directly on her breach of contract claim and Union Fidelity\u2019s defense of rescission. Barbara maintains that absent such rudimentary underwriting as requiring fact-specific information regarding an applicant\u2019s medical history, a material misrepresentation cannot occur, hence Union Fidelity\u2019s rescission of Clarence\u2019s application was improper as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b188-8\">\u00b631 Relying on <em>Schneider v. Minn. Mut. Life Ins. Co. </em>(1991), 247 Mont. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"169\">*169</page-number>334, 806 P.2d 1032, the District Court denied Barbara\u2019s motion for summary judgment on the basis that \u201cthe bottom line question is a question of fact for a jury to determine.\u201d In that case, Jock Schneider (Jock) had purchased group life insurance through Minnesota Mutual Life Insurance Company (Mutual). In completing the application, Jock represented that he had not been hospitalized or consulted a physician during the last three years and that he had not been treated for the various health problems listed in the application. Sixteen days later, Jock died of an accidental gunshot wound to the head. During its investigation, Mutual learned that Jock had been under a physician\u2019s care for alcoholism and depression. Mutual rescinded the policy. <em>Schneider, </em>247 Mont. at 336-37, 806 P.2d at 1034.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-4\">\u00b632 Jock\u2019s wife, Darlene, sued Mutual alleging breach of contract and seeking punitive damages. Mutual argued that recission was appropriate because the misrepresentation was material and that Mutual in good faith would not have issued the policy if Mutual had known about the doctor visits. Mutual appealed the district court\u2019s judgment in favor of Darlene. On appeal, this Court expressly stated that questions of materiality and of good faith are both questions of fact. <em>Schneider, </em>247 Mont. at 339-40, 806 P.2d at 1036.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-5\">\u00b633  Therefore, we hold that the District Court did not err in denying Barbara\u2019s motion for summary judgment as there still remained genuine issues of material fact as to whether there was a misrepresentation on Clarence\u2019s part and, if so, whether that misrepresentation was material. We also hold that the District Court did not err in denying Barbara\u2019s motion for judgment as a matter of law because there was sufficient evidence to justify submitting those issues to the jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-6\">\u00b634 Accordingly, we hold that the District Court did not err in denying Barbara\u2019s motion for summary judgment and motion for judgment as a matter of law.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-7\">Issue 2.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-8\">\u00b635 <em>Whether the District Court erred in admitting into evidence at trial Clarence\u2019s medical records acquired by Union Fidelity after Barbara\u2019s claim had been denied and her Certificate of Insurance rescinded.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b189-9\">\u00b636 The District Court admitted Clarence\u2019s medical records at trial on the basis that it was for the jury to decide whether there was a material misrepresentation made by Clarence such that Union Fidelity could rescind the insurance contract and that type of review would necessitate reviewing the medical records.</p>\n<p id=\"b189-10\">\u00b637 Barbara argues on appeal that these records were allowed into <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"170\">*170</page-number>evidence absent any foundation establishing that they existed at the time Clarence purchased credit life insurance from Union Fidelity, or that they had been seen, read, or relied upon by Clarence, Barbara, or anyone at Union Fidelity.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-4\">\u00b638 Union Fidelity argues that the medical records for the time period prior to the insurance purchase were introduced as evidence of what Clarence knew. Union Fidelity further argues that the medical records for the time period after the insurance purchase were introduced as evidence that Clarence had not been successfully treated for cancer and that the cancer he was diagnosed with in 1996 caused his death in 1997.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-5\">\u00b639 We review a district court\u2019s ruling on evidentiary issues for an abuse of discretion. <em>Lopez v. Josephson, </em>2001 MT 133, \u00b6 14, 305 Mont. 446, \u00b6 14, 30 P.3d 326, \u00b6 14 (citing <em>Simmons Oil Corp. v. Wells Fargo Bank, </em>1998 MT 129, \u00b6 17, 289 Mont. 119, \u00b6 17, 960 P.2d 291, \u00b6 17). A district court has broad discretion to determine whether evidence is relevant and admissible. <em>Lopez, </em>\u00b6 14. The question is not whether this Court would have reached the same decision, but, whether the district court acted arbitrarily without conscientious judgment or exceeded the bounds of reason. <em>Lopez, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b190-6\">\u00b640  In the case <em>sub judice, </em>we conclude that the District Court did not act arbitrarily without conscientious judgment or exceed the bounds of reason when it admitted Clarence\u2019s medical records into evidence at trial. In her brief on appeal, Barbara failed to identify any allegedly prejudicial information contained in Clarence\u2019s medical records, or show how the introduction of those records harmed the case. On the contrary, the District Court was acting within its discretion by allowing the members of the jury to view the medical records for themselves and make their own determinations as to Clarence\u2019s condition at the time he signed the Certificate of Insurance.

Lentz had signed an insurance application declaring that \u201cto the best of my knowledge and belief I am now in good health.\u201d As the insurer later discovered, Lentz had been hospitalized just weeks before buying his insurance due to high blood pressure, back pain, abdominal aneurysm and because \u201chis kidneys weren\u2019t doing their full work.\u201d The insurer also learned that Lentz\u2019s doctor knew he was in terrible shape, but reassured Lentz that his health was improving in order to avoid frightening him to death. <em>Lentz, </em>164 Mont. at 199-200, 520 P.2d at 770.</p>\n<p id=\"b192-5\">\u00b649 This Court refused to find that Lentz had misrepresented his health and stated instead:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b192-6\">[WJhere the applicant for life insurance certifies that his health is good according to the best of his knowledge and belief, a recovery may be had, on the death of the insured, if it appears that he had reason to believe and did believe, that at the time he was in good health, although it subsequently develops that this was not in fact his condition, for <em>his statement was not unqualified, but only to the extent of his knowledge and belief.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"AIv\"><em>Lentz, </em>164 Mont. at 203, 520 P.2d at 772 (emphasis added) (quoting <em>Couch on Insurance 2d, </em>\u00a7 35:150).</p>\n<p id=\"b192-7\">\u00b650 In this case, the jury instructions did not, in their entirety, state the applicable law of the case.

As previously stated, to prevail on a motion for summary judgment, the moving party must first establish the absence of genuine issues of material fact. In like manner, judgment as a matter of law is properly granted only when there is a complete absence of any evidence which would justify submitting an issue to a jury. Union Fidelity has not met either burden in this case and, contrary to Chief Justice Gray\u2019s position, it is not our job to try to resolve the underlying issues-that is what trials are for.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-5\">Issue <em>5.</em></p>\n<p id=\"b194-6\">\u00b660 <em>Whether the District Court erred by granting Barbara\u2019s motion in limine precluding Union Fidelity from presenting evidence about Barbara\u2019s and Clarence\u2019s </em>bankruptcy.</p>\n<p id=\"b194-7\">\u00b661 Union Fidelity argues that evidence of Barbara\u2019s and Clarence\u2019s bankruptcy was relevant to the issue of damages as well as to Clarence\u2019s credibility and state of mind. Union Fidelity asserts that the bankruptcy evidence establishes that both Barbara and Clarence knew they could not pay for the truck on the day they purchased it-evidence that they were not acting in good faith.

The Court does not discuss <em>Thomas, </em>but it is my view that <em>Thomas </em>supports Barbara\u2019s position that \u00a7 33-18-242(3), MCA, does not bar her bad faith cause of action insofar as it pertains to alleged pre-claim conduct by Union Fidelity.</p>\n<p id=\"b196-10\">\u00b675 In <em>Thomas, </em>a business and its owners (collectively, the business) purchased a commercial insurance policy in 1989 and renewed it annually through 1993. <em>Thomas, </em>\u00b6 7. In 1990, the policy was amended to exclude coverage for pollution. <em>Thomas, </em>\u00b6 10. A customer sued the business over a fuel oil spill that occurred in 1992, and the insurer refused to defend or indemnify the business. After the customer received judgment, the business sued for indemnification. <em>Thomas, </em>\u00b6 8. The business alleged that, by failing to provide adequate notice of the amendment, the insurer acted negligently, breached an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and breached its fiduciary duty. <em>Thomas, </em>\u00b6 11. The district court granted summary judgment to the insurer. It reasoned in part that \u00a7 33-18-242(3), MCA-which delineates certain actions which an insured may bring as a result of an insurer\u2019s handling of an insurance claim and prohibits common law bad faith claims vis-a-vis the handling of a claim-precluded the business from <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"177\">*177</page-number>pursuing common law theories. <em>Thomas, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 12-13, 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-4\">\u00b676 On appeal, we determined that \u201cthe [UTPA] addresses the relationship between an insured and an insurance company once a claim has been filed,\u201d and stated the business\u2019 causes of action \u201cpertain to events that occurred prior to the handling of the claim.\u201d <em>Thomas, </em>\u00b6 33. Noting the insurer\u2019s argument that \u201csuit was filed by appellants only after their demand for insurance coverage was denied,\u201d we reasoned \u00a7 33-18-201, MCA-which generally prohibits unfair claim settlement practices-did not address the tort allegations raised in the complaint. <em>Thomas, </em>\u00b6 34. Distinguishing cases involving \u201cactual handling\u201d of claims, we noted that \u201c[h]ere, appellants allege pure common law claims without adding violations of the [UTPA].\u201d <em>Thomas, </em>\u00b6 36. We concluded that \u00a7 33-18-242(3), MCA, did not bar the common law causes of action. <em>Thomas, </em>\u00b6 37.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-5\">\u00b677 Since <em>Thomas, </em>we have recognized that \u201c\u00a7 33-18-242(3), MCA, \u2018explicitly prohibits bringing an action for bad faith in connection with the handling of an insurance claim.\u2019 \u201d <em>Watters v.

The distinction between pre-claim events in <em>Thomas </em>and claim handling in <em>Watters </em>is entirely consistent with the statutes and I would expressly apply it here.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-6\">\u00b678 In her complaint, Barbara asserted Union Fidelity \u201ctortiously breached the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing in connection with the application process and underwriting^]\u201d On appeal, Barbara contends Union Fidelity committed bad faith during the application and pre-claim underwriting process by failing to define terms such as \u201cgood health,\u201d failing to include health-specific questions on the application, and \u201cma[king] certain that neither rescission nor claim denial was discussed at the point of sale.\u201d These allegations refer to conduct before the claim, not to the handling of the claim once made. Therefore, I would apply <em>Thomas </em>and conclude that Barbara may proceed with her bad faith action only in relation to Union Fidelity\u2019s pre-claim application process and pre-claim underwriting.</p>\n<p id=\"b197-7\">\u00b679 Union Fidelity asserts, however, that \u201c[t]here can be no dispute that [Barbara\u2019s] claims arise from the denial of the insurance claim.\u201d As mentioned above, we noted a similar argument in <em>Thomas, </em>\u00b6 34, and stated the alleged torts at issue there were not contemplated in \u00a7 33-18-201, MCA. In my view, we improperly shifted the focus in <em>Thomas </em>from the insurer\u2019s argument about when the tort accrued to an analysis of whether the alleged tort was covered by the UTPA. I <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"178\">*178</page-number>would not follow <em>Thomas </em>in that regard.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-4\">\u00b680 The first sentence of \u00a7 33-18-242(3), MCA, limits causes of action available to \u201c[a]n insured who has suffered damages as a result of the handling of an insurance claim[.]\u201d Our recognition of non-UTPA tort actions involving pre-claim conduct in <em>Thomas </em>indicates the \u201cas a result of\u2019 language refers to the relationship between the insurer\u2019s conduct and the damages, rather than merely whether the damages arose before or after the claim. Indeed, as in <em>Thomas, </em>the insured\u2019s damages in nearly every case involving pre-claim conduct will not arise until the insurer handles the claim. Pursuant to <em>Thomas, </em>therefore, it is my view that Barbara\u2019s bad faith action may proceed to trial on the theory that the alleged damages occurred \u201cas a result of\u2019 Union Fidelity\u2019s alleged pre-claim conduct.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-5\">\u00b681 Union Fidelity also asserts, however, that the UTPA \u201cprecluded\u201d Barbara from alleging both UTPA violations and bad faith in her complaint, and it supports this assertion with our reference to \u201cpirre common law claims\u201d in <em>Thomas, </em>\u00b6 36. In my view, our observation of the \u201cpure common law claims\u201d in <em>Thomas </em>did not establish a rule that a plaintiff must choose between asserting UTPA violations and common law torts. Indeed, <em>Thomas </em>did not involve alleged UTPA violations. Moreover, we recognized in <em>Thomas, </em>\u00b6 35, that the UTPA is not an insured\u2019s exclusive remedy. Finally, of course, Rule 8(e)(2), M.R.Civ.P., specifically allows a plaintiff to plead alternatively. Here, Barbara has alleged various causes of action, some with respect to different factual assertions. I would conclude the UTPA does not prevent her from doing so.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-6\">\u00b682 In summary, I concur in the Court\u2019s conclusion that \u00a7 33-18-242(3), MCA, does not bar Barbara\u2019s bad faith cause of action, but I would limit the scope of that action to Union Fidelity\u2019s pre-claim conduct. Consequently, I disagree with the Court\u2019s apparent adoption in \u00b6 30 of Barbara\u2019s argument that the prohibition against post-claim underwriting in \u00a7 33-18-215, MCA, relates to her bad faith allegation. I would conclude that, while she may assert post-claim underwriting in relation to some allegations, she may not do so in relation to the alleged pre-claim bad faith.</p>\n<p id=\"b198-7\">\u00b683 With respect to Barbara\u2019s fraud cause of action, the Court notes in \u00b6 55 that Barbara argues her fraud allegation is \u201cwell supported as she and Clarence relied upon Union Fidelity\u2019s selling agent\u2019s promise of coverage[.]\u201d On appeal, Barbara points to the selling agent\u2019s deposition testimony that he promised \u201cpeace of mind.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b198-8\">\u00b684 A <em>prima facie </em>case of fraud consists of the following nine elements: (1) a representation; (2) the falsity of that representation; (3) the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"179\">*179</page-number>materiality of the representation; (4) the speaker\u2019s knowledge of the representation\u2019s falsity or ignorance of its truth; (5) the speaker\u2019s intent that the representation should be acted upon by the person and in the manner reasonably contemplated; (6) the hearer\u2019s ignorance of the representation\u2019s falsity; (7) the hearer\u2019s reliance on the truth of the representation; (8) the hearer\u2019s right to rely on the representation; and (9) the hearer\u2019s consequent and proximate injury or damages caused by relying on the representation. <em>See In re Estate of Kindsfather, </em>2005 MT 51, \u00b6 17, 326 Mont. 192, \u00b6 17, 108 P.3d 487, \u00b6 17 (citations omitted). I imagine insurance agents generally promise coverage at the time of sale, and I do not believe a reference to \u201cpeace of mind\u201d constitutes a guarantee of coverage in all circumstances. I would not permit this fraud claim to proceed to trial solely because a selling agent generally promised coverage and the insurer later denied a specific claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-4\">\u00b685 More importantly, the Court does not address Union Fidelity\u2019s reliance on Barbara\u2019s deposition testimony that the salesperson did not talk her and Clarence into buying insurance and did not make any misrepresentations or misleading statements. Thus, through Barbara\u2019s deposition, Union Fidelity established the absence of any genuine issue of material fact regarding, at least, the \u201cfalsity\u201d and \u201creliance\u201d elements of Barbara\u2019s fraud claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b199-5\">\u00b686 The burden then shifts to Barbara to present material and substantial evidence, rather than mere conclusory or speculative statements, to raise a genuine issue of material fact. <em>See Hanson v. Water Ski Mania Estates, </em>2005 MT 47, \u00b6 11, 326 Mont. 154, \u00b6 11, 108 P.3d 481, \u00b6 11 (citations omitted). From my perspective, Barbara\u2019s reference to the agent\u2019s \u201cpeace of mind\u201d statement and the general promise of coverage relied on by the Court do not constitute material and substantial evidence raising a genuine issue of material fact with respect to the \u201cfalsity\u2019 and \u201creliance\u201d elements of the fraud claim. Therefore, in light of Barbara\u2019s deposition testimony and the generic nature of the allegedly fraudulent representations, I dissent from the Court\u2019s conclusion that Barbara may proceed with her fraud claim.</p>\n<p id=\"AJe\">\u00b687 The Court\u2019s response to this concurring and dissenting opinion relating to Barbara\u2019s bad faith and fraud claims consists primarily of sweeping statements about my inability to recognize our standards of review of a district court\u2019s granting of summary judgment and judgment as a matter of law. There is no question that I understand those standards. Nor is the Court correct that I have faulted it for not performing an in-depth analysis of the fraud and bad faith claims or \u201cresolved\u201d the underlying issues which ought to be tried.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"180\">*180</page-number>\u00b688 With regard to the bad faith claim, I state clearly above that I concur in the result, but do not believe the Court presents an adequate analysis of whether the District Court erred in denying Union Fidelity\u2019s motion for summary judgment in that regard. Yes, we determine on appeal whether the moving party met its burden and was entitled to judgment as a matter of law. That standard generally requires us, however, to actually make determinations based on the record and the law. The Court\u2019s opinion on this portion of Issue 4 does neither.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-4\">\u00b689 The Court presents Union Fidelity\u2019s arguments in one paragraph, followed by Barbara\u2019s arguments in the next; the third paragraph properly sets forth the standards relating to summary judgment; and the fourth paragraph sets out the standards relating to judgment as a matter of law. The Court then immediately \u201cholds\u201d that the District Court did not err in denying the motion for summary judgment on bad faith or the motion for judgment as a matter of law because \u201cthere still remained genuine issues of material fact[,]\u201d and \u201cthere was sufficient evidence to justify submitting those issues to the jury.\u201d It further holds that \u00a7 33-18-242(3), MCA, does not bar Barbara\u2019s bad faith claim. My concern with the Court\u2019s opinion is that it sets forth nothing of record or of law in these regards.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-5\">\u00b690 What genuine issues of material fact or evidence sufficient to go to the jury has the Court located? What of the legal arguments and authorities advanced by the parties? Why does \u00a7 38-18-242(3), MCA, not bar the bad faith claim? These questions-and my attempt to provide legal analysis-are not failures on my part to recognize the standards relating to summary judgment and judgment as a matter of law; nor do I resolve in any way underlying issues which should go to the jury. The Court\u2019s opinion-in my view-is simply devoid of the substantive analysis we generally include to give appropriate guidance to the parties and the trial court in this case, and practitioners and trial courts in future cases.</p>\n<p id=\"b200-6\">\u00b691 On the off chance that the Court truly is missing the point of my concurring and dissenting opinion-especially with regard to providing an analysis to serve as a basis for its holdings-it is appropriate to look to recent opinions by this Court on summary judgment issues. Since the end of February this year, we have issued more than a dozen published opinions addressing summary judgment issues. <em>See, e.g., Hi-Tech Motors, Inc. v. Bombardier Motor Corp. of Am., </em>2005 MT 187, 328 Mont. 66, 117 P.3d 159; <em>Bonilla v. Univ. of Mont., </em>2005 MT 183, 328 Mont. 41, 116 P.3d 823; <em>Eves v.

None of those opinions addresses summary judgment/judgment as a matter of law issues without either factual or legal analysis or both.</p>\n<p id=\"A8u\">\u00b692 For these reasons, I cannot join the Court\u2019s opinion on Issue 4.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
