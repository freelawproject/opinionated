We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-15\">\u00b62 Bowser raises the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b241-16\">\u00b63 1. Whether the State violated Bowser\u2019s right to a speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-17\">\u00b64 2. Whether Bowser\u2019s counsel\u2019s failure to object to the search warrant denied him effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b241-18\">\u00b65 3. Whether the District Court erred in admitting certain <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"222\">*222</page-number>methamphetamine evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-4\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b242-5\">\u00b66 Butte-Silver Bow police officers John David Christie (Christie) and Ed Lester (Lester) witnessed a forensic interview at St. James Community Hospital on February 8,2001. Two Department of Family Services employees were interviewing Bowser\u2019s minor children, Lane Bowser and Kyla Bowser, regarding an alleged sexual assault. Lane and Kyla volunteered information during the interview regarding their father\u2019s drug use and the regular presence of drugs and paraphernalia in the home.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-6\">\u00b67 Officer Christie applied for and received a search warrant for Bowser\u2019s residence based on the information provided by Bowser\u2019s children. The search revealed evidence of drug use, including a marijuana pipe and thirteen small baggies containing a powdery white substance. The officers collected the evidence from Bowser\u2019s residence and sent it to the State Crime Lab for testing. Annalivia Bishop (Bishop), a forensic chemist for the State Crime Lab, tested one of the thirteen baggies and determined that it tested positive for methamphetamine.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-7\">\u00b68 The State charged Bowser with one count of felony criminal possession of dangerous drugs, one count of misdemeanor criminal possession of dangerous drugs, and one count of misdemeanor criminal possession of drug paraphernalia on September 19,2001. Bowser filed a motion to dismiss for violation of his right to a speedy trial on September 3,2003. The District Court held a hearing on the motion on October 29, 2003. The District Court denied the motion and jury trial commenced on December 1, 2003-a pretrial delay of 802 days.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-8\">\u00b69 The jury found Bowser guilty of felony criminal possession of dangerous drugs and misdemeanor criminal possession of drug paraphernalia. The District Court sentenced Bowser to two years in the custody of the Department of Corrections with all of the two years suspended. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b242-9\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b242-10\">\u00b610 Whether a defendant has been denied a speedy trial presents a question of law. <em>State v. Bertolino, </em>2003 MT 266, \u00b6 10, 317 Mont. 453, \u00b6 10, 77 P.3d 543, \u00b6 10. We review a district court\u2019s legal conclusions to determine whether its interpretations are correct. <em>Bertolino, </em>\u00b6 10. Claims of ineffective assistance of counsel present mixed questions of law and fact that we review <em>de novo. State v. Kougl, </em>2004 MT 243, \u00b6 12, 323 Mont. 6, \u00b6 12, 97 P.3d 1095, \u00b6 12. We review rulings on the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"223\">*223</page-number>admissibility of evidence for an abuse of discretion. <em>State v. Damon, </em>2005 MT 218, \u00b6 12, 328 Mont. 276, \u00b6 12, 119 P.3d 1194, \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b243-5\">\u00b611 1. Whether the State violated Bowser\u2019s right to a speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-6\">\u00b612 The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 24 of the Montana Constitution guarantee a criminal defendant\u2019s right to a speedy trial. We analyze speedy trial claims based on the general guidelines established by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Barker v. Wingo </em>(1972), 407 U.S. 514, 92 S.Ct. 2182, 33 L.Ed.2d 101. <em>State v. Blair, </em>2004 MT 356, \u00b6 14, 324 Mont. 444, \u00b6 14, 103 P.3d 538, \u00b6 14. We consider four factors under the <em>Barker </em>analysis: (1) length of delay; (2) reason for delay; (3) assertion of speedy trial right by the defendant; and (4) prejudice to the defense. <em>Blair, </em>\u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"AG1\">\u00b613  The State concedes that Bowser\u2019s claim satisfies the first three factors. The State acknowledges that the District Court properly attributed more than 275 days to the State by reason of institutional delay. The State therefore concedes that it bears the burden of proving that the delay did not prejudice Bowser. <em>Blair, </em>\u00b6 16. The sole issue is thus whether the district court erred in determining that the State met its burden of showing that the delay did not prejudice Bowser. A defendant can establish prejudice to the defense based on any of the following three factors: (1) pretrial incarceration; (2) anxiety and concern to the defendant; and (3) impairment of defense. <em>Blair, </em>\u00b6 27.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-7\">Pretrial Incarceration</p>\n<p id=\"b243-8\">\u00b614 The State argues that Bowser served 154 days of incarceration prior to the commencement of his trial in a federal prison regarding a separate offense, and thus no prejudice resulted from his pending charges in this case. Bowser counters that his 154 days of incarceration prejudiced him.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-9\">\u00b615  Incarceration on different charges negates any prejudice from incarceration while awaiting trial. <em>State v. Gould </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 207, 217, 902 P.2d 532, 539; <em>State v. Hembd </em>(1992), 254 Mont. 407, 414, 838 P.2d 412, 416. Officers arrested Bowser on December 20,2001, for violating the conditions of probation for a separate federal offense. The federal district court then resentenced Bowser to 154 days with the Bureau of Prisons. Bowser served this time while awaiting trial on the drug possession charges at issue here. Bowser\u2019s pretrial incarceration was for the separate federal charges, thus negating any prejudice in this case. <em>Gould, </em>273 Mont. at 217, 902 P.2d at 539.</p>\n<p id=\"b243-10\">Anxiety and Concern</p>\n<p id=\"b244-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"224\">*224</page-number>\u00b616 The State asserts that Bowser has failed to show that the delay aggravated his anxiety and concern above and beyond the fact of being charged with the crime in the first place. Bowser counters that he suffered anxiety and concern resulting from the pretrial delay. He further argues that he has been denied access to his children and the delay has caused his relationship with them to deteriorate.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-4\">\u00b617 Anxiety and concern are an inherent part of being charged with a crime. <em>State v. Jefferson, </em>2003 MT 90, \u00b6 32, 315 Mont. 146, \u00b6 32, 69 P.3d 641, \u00b6 32. We therefore consider the extent to which the pretrial delay aggravated a defendant\u2019s anxiety and concern. <em>Jefferson, </em>\u00b6 32.</p>\n<p id=\"ADe\">\u00b618 Dr. Tim Casey performed a mental health evaluation on Bowser at the State\u2019s request. The District Court referred to Dr. Casey\u2019s findings in its order denying Bowser\u2019s motion to dismiss on speedy trial grounds. Specifically, the court noted that Dr. Casey\u2019s psychological evaluation did not reflect a man suffering from great anxiety and concern. Dr. Casey reported that Bowser was not particularly anxious and that Bowser\u2019s reported distress was over his divorce and placement of his children in foster care.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-5\">\u00b619 We must defer to district court findings unless they are clearly erroneous. <em>In re Marriage of Mease, </em>2004 MT 59, \u00b6 50, 320 Mont. 229, \u00b6 50, 92 P.3d 1148, \u00b6 50. A district court finding is clearly erroneous if it is not supported by credible evidence, if the court misapprehended the effect of the evidence, or if a review of the record leaves us with a definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed. <em>Guthrie v. Hardy, </em>2001 MT 122, \u00b6 24, 305 Mont. 367, \u00b6 24, 28 P.3d 467, \u00b6 24. The District Court considered the results of Dr. Casey\u2019s psychological evaluation in concluding that Bowser was not unduly prejudiced by anxiety and concern from the delay. Bowser has failed to point to other factors to overcome this evaluation. We thus defer to the District Court\u2019s finding that the pretrial delay did not aggravate Bowser\u2019s anxiety and concern.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-8\">Impairment of Defense</p>\n<p id=\"b244-9\">\u00b620 The State finally asserts that Bowser\u2019s defense has not been impaired, as it had preserved all evidence through videotape, photographs, and written reports. Moreover, the State argues that all of Bowser\u2019s potential defense witnesses had been located and were available to testify at trial. Bowser contends that the pretrial delay prejudiced his defense. He makes general allegations that witnesses\u2019 memories are \u201cnecessarily impaired,\u201d and that he suffers from increased paranoia, causing impairment of his defense.</p>\n<p id=\"b244-10\">\u00b621 We analyze issues of evidence, witness reliability, and the defendant\u2019s ability to prepare a defense when determining whether <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"225\">*225</page-number>pretrial delay impaired a defense. <em>Jefferson, </em>\u00b6 36. We recognize that time may erode the accuracy of witness testimony and exculpatory evidence. <em>Jefferson, </em>\u00b6 36. Consequently, we give more weight to whether the defense has been impaired than any other basis for concluding that the defendant has been prejudiced by pretrial delay. <em>Jefferson, </em>\u00b6 36.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-4\">\u00b622 The District Court determined that the passage of time had not impaired Bowser\u2019s defense. Officer Christie testified at the hearing on Bowser\u2019s motion to dismiss that the State had preserved all of the potential evidence in this case. Specifically, he testified that the videotapes of the children\u2019s interviews, the photographs of Bowser\u2019s residence, the photographs of the officers\u2019 actions while searching Bowser\u2019s residence, the contraband seized, Bishop\u2019s forensic report, and Officer Christie\u2019s personal report of actions he took the day he searched Bowser\u2019s residence were available for use at trial. Moreover, Officer Lester testified that he easily located all of Bowser\u2019s potential witnesses. He further testified that these witnesses were available to testify at trial and possessed an adequate memory of the events in question. The court therefore concluded that the State met its burden of showing that the pretrial delay had not impaired Bowser\u2019s defense.</p>\n<p id=\"AQ\">\u00b623  We agree with the findings of the District Court. The State had preserved all of the physical evidence, and all of Bowser\u2019s witnesses were available to testify at the trial. Indeed, two of those witnesses did testify at trial. The State memorialized its evidence through written reports, videotape and photographs. Other than a general allegation that witnesses\u2019 memories are \u201cnecessarily impaired\u201d and a claim of increasing paranoia, Bowser offers no evidence and cites no particular instances in which the pretrial delay impaired his defense. We thus affirm the District Court\u2019s order denying Bowser\u2019s motion to dismiss for violation of his right to a speedy trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-5\">\u00b624 2. Whether Bowser\u2019s counsel\u2019s failure to object to the search warrant denied him effective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"AQL\">\u00b625 Bowser argues that his counsel's failure to object to the search warrant obtained for the search of his residence denied him effective assistance of counsel. He asserts that the District Court would have sustained an objection to the warrant, and all evidence resulting from the search would have been ruled inadmissible. The State counters that Bowser\u2019s claim is better suited for consideration in post-conviction relief proceedings.</p>\n<p id=\"b245-6\">\u00b626  Ineffective assistance of counsel claims fall into two categories: record-based and non-record based. <em>State v. Earl, </em>2003 MT 158, \u00b6 39, 316 Mont. 263, \u00b6 39, 71 P.3d 1201, \u00b6 39. A party may raise only record-<page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"226\">*226</page-number>based ineffective assistance claims on direct appeal. <em>Earl, </em>\u00b6 39. We distinguish record-based from non-record-based actions based on whether the record fully explains why counsel took, or failed to take, a particular course of action in providing a defense. <em>State v. White, </em>2001 MT 149, \u00b6 20, 306 Mont. 58, \u00b6 20, 30 P.3d 340, \u00b6 20. The claimant must raise a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel in a petition for post-conviction relief if the allegation cannot be documented from the record. <em>Earl, </em>\u00b6 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-4\">\u00b627 Although the record is clear that Bowser\u2019s counsel failed to object to the search warrant, the record is silent on the question of why he chose not to object. Bowser\u2019s claim is therefore non-record based and inappropriate for direct appeal. We dismiss the ineffective assistance of counsel claim without prejudice to its being raised in a post-conviction relief proceeding. <em>State v. Hendricks, </em>2003 MT 223, \u00b6 12, 317 Mont. 177, \u00b6 12, 75 P.3d 1268, \u00b6 12.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-5\">\u00b628 3. Whether the District Court erred in admitting certain methamphetamine evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-6\">\u00b629 Bowser argues that the District Court erred in admitting certain methamphetamine evidence because the State failed to establish a proper chain of custody. He argues that the District Court\u2019s exclusion from evidence of the marijuana pipe, shipped to the State Crime lab via UPS, likewise necessitated exclusion of the thirteen baggies, that also had been shipped to the State Crime Lab via UPS. The State counters that it met its burden of showing that a proper chain of custody existed with respect to the thirteen baggies.</p>\n<p id=\"b246-7\">\u00b630  The State bears the burden of showing a continuous chain of possession without any substantial change in the evidence while in its possession when identifying evidence by a chain of custody. <em>State v. Weeks </em>(1995), 270 Mont. 63, 75, 891 P.2d 477, 484. The burden then shifts to the defendant to show that the evidence has been tampered with while in the State\u2019s custody. <em>Weeks, </em>270 Mont. at 75, 891 P.2d at 484. The State does not need to show that it possessed the evidence at all times; rather, the State must establish a continuous chain of custody. <em>Weeks, 270 </em>Mont. at 75, 891 P.2d at 485. For instance, the postal service or parcel carrier may have possession of evidence at times. This does not break the chain of custody. <em>Weeks, </em>270 Mont at 76, 891 P.2d at 485. The State need only demonstrate to the court\u2019s satisfaction that no substantial change occurred in the evidence from the time that the State gathered it to the time that the State tested it or offered it into evidence. <em>Weeks, </em>270 Mont. at 76, 891 P.2d at 485.</p>\n<p id=\"AWd\">\u00b631 Officer Christie testified that the marijuana pipe was not in substantially the same condition as when he locked it into evidence. He <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"227\">*227</page-number>testified that the top of the pipe was on when he locked it into evidence. Officer Christie testified that at the time of trial, however, the top was off. Bishop, the State Crime Lab expert, testified that the top was off the pipe when she received and examined it. The pipe therefore was not in substantially the same condition at trial or when received for testing as when Officer Christie seized it from Bowser\u2019s residence. The District Court ruled that there had been a break in the chain of custody and correctly excluded the pipe from evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-4\">\u00b632 In contrast, Officer Christie testified that he seized the thirteen baggies from Bowser\u2019s house and put them into an evidence bag. He further testified that he placed the baggies into an evidence locker at the police station. He then sent the baggies to the State Crime Lab. Bishop testified that she received the baggies in a manila envelope sealed with tamper resistant evidence tape. She further testified that there was no sign of tampering with the outer package, and that each package on the inside of the manila envelope was properly sealed. Bishop then analyzed one of the baggies for the presence of controlled substances. She further testified that following her analysis she sealed the envelope with tape from the State Crime Lab and affixed it with a sticker bearing the laboratory case number, the date the evidence was opened, and her signature. Bishop also testified that at the time of trial none of the bags\u2019 seals appeared to have been broken. The baggies were returned to the custody of Butte-Silver Bow Law Enforcement Agency following Bishop\u2019s analysis. Officer Christie testified that he received the baggies from the State Crime Lab and placed them back into the evidence locker where they remained until trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-5\">\u00b633  The testimony from both Officer Christie and Bishop demonstrates that the baggies were in substantially the same condition as they were when Officer Christie first seized them. The fact that UPS possessed the items at times does not break the chain of custody. <em>Weeks, </em>270 Mont at 76, 891 P.2d at 485. The State must show only that the evidence was in substantially the same condition at trial as when it was first seized. <em>Weeks, </em>270 Mont. at 76, 891 P.2d at 485. The State has thus met its burden of showing a proper chain of custody for the thirteen baggies. The District Court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the baggies into evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b247-6\">\u00b634 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b247-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, WARNER and LEAPHART concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
