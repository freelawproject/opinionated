We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-5\">\u00b62 The State argues on appeal that \u00a7 61-8-731, MCA (2001), legally prohibits the District Court from granting Jivelekas approval to operate a motor vehicle. Jivelekas argues that the appeal should be dismissed because the State did not file its appeal within fourteen days of the District Court\u2019s original order and judgment filed April 25,2002, as mandated by Rule 5(b), M.R.App.P. Because we agree with Jivelekas that the State\u2019s appeal is untimely, we dismiss.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-6\">\u00b63 We state the issues as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b227-7\">\u00b64 1. Whether the District Court had jurisdiction to hear Jivelekas\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-8\">\u00b65 2. Whether the State is time-barred from appealing the District Court\u2019s order and judgment of April 24, 2002.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b227-10\">\u00b66 On April 25,2002, the Montana Thirteenth Judicial District Court of Yellowstone County filed judgment convicting Jivelekas of Count I, Driving Under the Influence of Alcohol and/or Drugs (Felony), and Count II, Driving while the Privilege to do so is Suspended or Revoked (Misdemeanor). The District Court sentenced Jivelekas to the Department of Corrections (DOC) for thirteen months, followed by five years of probation. Jivelekas completed his term with the DOC and, on October 21, 2002, successfully graduated from the Warm Springs Addiction Treatment and Change (WATCh) program. The next day, Jivelekas entered the department\u2019s probation program in Billings under the supervision of Probation Officer Mary Aggers.</p>\n<p id=\"b227-11\">\u00b67 The issue disputed by the parties stems from condition #13 of the District Court\u2019s original judgment and order filed April 25,2002, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b227-12\">The defendant shall not at anytime, anywhere, any place nor under any circumstances drive/operate a motor vehicle <em>unless approved by the sentencing Court and/or defendants Supervising Officer </em>at such period when determined defendant possesses a valid driver\u2019s license and insurance. At such period when determined defendant is legally able to drive/operate a motor <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"208\">*208</page-number>vehicle, defendant shall maintain an Ignition Interlock system on his motor vehicle for a period of no less than (1) one year while on supervised probation. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b228-4\">\u00b68 Nearly two years later, on April 8, 2004, Jivelekas filed with the District Court a motion asking for approval to operate a motor vehicle, pursuant to condition #13 of the judgment and order. Jivelekas informed the court that he had served his time with DOC, as well as successfully completed the WATCh program, along with sixteen weeks of Aftercare, eight weeks of Relapse Prevention, one year of monthly monitoring, and ninety Alcoholics Anonymous meetings in ninety days. He also had no incidences of drinking while on probation.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-5\">\u00b69 In his motion, Jivelekas explained that he worked full-time at Rocky Mountain Leisure Spas making repair calls at customers\u2019 homes. Because this employment requires driving to job sites, Jivelekas\u2019s inability to operate the company vehicle required his employer, Scott Oleson, or another employee, to serve as his driver. Due to this inconvenience, Jivelekas\u2019s hours dropped to almost half, and according to Oleson, created a hardship on the company. For these reasons, Jivelekas requested that the District Court authorize him to drive his personal vehicle to and from work as long as he maintained a valid driver\u2019s license and equipped his vehicle with an ignition interlock device. Jivelekas further requested permission to operate the company vehicle, not equipped with an interlock device, during work hours only.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-6\">\u00b610 The Yellowstone County Attorney did not object to Jivelekas\u2019s motion; however, Jivelekas\u2019s probation supervisor, Officer Aggers, opposed the motion. On behalf of Officer Aggers, the DOC filed an objection in District Court based in relevant part on \u00a7 61-8-731, MCA (2001):</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-7\">(3) The court shall, as a condition of probation, order:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b228-8\">(e) that the person may not operate a motor vehicle <em>unless authorized by the person\u2019s probation </em>officer. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"Aqu\">Pursuant to the above statute, the DOC argued that the District Court went beyond its authority by including condition #13 in its judgment and order, permitting Jivelekas to seek approval from the District Court to operate a motor vehicle. Despite the DOC\u2019s objection, the District Court granted Jivelekas permission to drive in an order filed May 3, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b228-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b228-10\">1. Whether the District Court had jurisdiction to hear</p>\n<p id=\"b229-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"209\">*209</page-number>Jivelekas\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-4\">\u00b611 Because jurisdictional challenges are not subject to time constraints, the DOC attempts to circumvent a time-bar on this appeal by arguing that the DOC \u201cdoes not allege the District Court imposed an <em>illegal sentence,\u201d </em>but rather, \u201cthe District Court did not have <em>jurisdiction </em>to hear Mr. Jivelekas\u2019s motion....\u201d (Emphasis added.) The DOC cites <em>Pe\u00f1a v. State, </em>2004 MT 293, \u00b6 22, 323 Mont. 347, \u00b6 22, 100 P.3d 154, \u00b6 22, in which this Court held that \u2018\u201cjurisdictional\u2019 claims are those which challenge a court\u2019s \u2018power\u2019 or \u2018capacity\u2019 to entertain the subject matter of the proceeding and render a determination therein.\u201d The DOC correctly cites <em>Pe\u00f1a </em>as precedent; however, further reading of the case fails to support the DOC\u2019s jurisdictional argument.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-5\">\u00b612 In <em>Pe\u00f1a, </em>the District Court sentenced seventeen-year-old Marcellino Pe\u00f1a to the Montana State Prison as an adult offender for a total of forty-five years on charges of deliberate homicide and aggravated burglary. Pe\u00f1a filed a petition for postconviction relief in the District Court, arguing that the court imposed an illegal sentence because, pursuant to \u00a7 41-5-206(6), MCA (1997), of the Youth Court Act, youths must be sentenced to the DOC, and, pursuant to \u00a7 46-18-201(l)(e), MCA (1997), the maximum sentence to which an individual could be sentenced to the DOC is five years. <em>Pe\u00f1a, </em>\u00b6 12. Pe\u00f1a further argued that pursuant to subpart (e) of the sentencing statute, \u00a7 46-18-201, MCA, the District Court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to sentence him to more than five years with the DOC. <em>Pe\u00f1a, </em>\u00b6 16.</p>\n<p id=\"b229-6\">\u00b613 In addressing Pe\u00f1a\u2019s argument, we looked to Article VII, Section 4, of the Montana Constitution, which provides the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-7\">Section 4. District court jurisdiction. (1) The district court has <em>original jurisdiction in all criminal cases amounting to a felony </em>and ... such additional jurisdiction as may be delegated by the laws of the United States or the state of Montana.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b229-8\"><em>Pe\u00f1a, </em>\u00b6 21 (emphasis added). We then explained that jurisdiction is the \u201c\u2018power\u2019 or \u2018capacity5 of a district court to hear a particular action as well as render a judgment therein.\u201d <em>Pe\u00f1a, </em>\u00b6 21. In conclusion, we held:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b229-9\">\u201c[J]urisdictional\u201d claims are those which challenge a court\u2019s \u201cpower\u201d or \u201ccapacity\u2019 to entertain the subject matter of the proceeding and render a determination therein. Thus, although Pe\u00f1a argues that the sentencing court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to sentence him to the DOC for more than five years by virtue of \u00a7\u00a7 41-5-206(6) and 46-18-201(1), MCA, Pe\u00f1a\u2019s argument is not properly characterized as a jurisdictional inquiry. <em>Whether a district court commits a statutory error in imposing a </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"210\">*210</page-number><em>sentence must not be confused with the question of whether the court had the \u201cpower\u201d or \u201ccapacity\u201d to impose the sentence in the first instance. An error in sentencing does not divest a district court of subject matter jurisdiction over the case before it.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b230-4\"><em>Pe\u00f1a, </em>\u00b6 22 (emphasis added). <em>See also Camarillo v. State, </em>2005 MT 29, \u00b6 17, 326 Mont. 35, \u00b6 17, 107 P.3d 1265, \u00b6 17; and <em>Sanders v. State, </em>2004 MT 374, \u00b6 15, 325 Mont. 59, \u00b6 15, 103 P.3d 1053, \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-5\">\u00b614  Despite the DOC\u2019s assertion that it \u201cdoes not allege the district court imposed an illegal sentence,\u201d only that the court \u201cdid not have jurisdiction to hear Mr. Jivelekas\u2019s motion,\u201d we find the former to be a more accurate characterization of the DOC\u2019s objection. The DOC argues that \u201cthe lower court did not have statutory authority because Montana explicitly gives a probation officer, not the district court, the discretion to determine when a felony DUI offender should operate a motor vehicle.\u201d As we have previously noted: \u201cA sentence not based on statutory authority is an illegal sentence.\u201d <em>State v. Ruiz, </em>2005 MT 117, \u00b6 12, 327 Mont. 109, \u00b6 12, 112 P.3d 1001, \u00b6 12 (citing <em>Pe\u00f1a, </em>\u00b6 24). \u201cAn error in sentencing does not divest a district court of subject matter jurisdiction over the case before it.\u201d <em>Pe\u00f1a, </em>\u00b6 22. Thus, even assuming, arguendo, that the District Court exceeded its statutory authority, it still had jurisdiction over Jivelekas\u2019s motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-6\">2. Whether the State is time-barred from appealing the District Court\u2019s order and judgment filed April 25,2002.</p>\n<p id=\"ACz\">\u00b615 Without question, the terms of condition #13 in the judgment and order grant both the probation officer and/or the sentencing court the authority to reinstate Jivelekas\u2019s driving privileges, creating a conflict with \u00a7 61-8-731, MCA. Jivelekas acknowledges as much, noting that the sentencing order\u2019s language conflicts \u201cwith the precise statutory language\u201d of \u00a7 61-8-731, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-7\">\u00b616 In accordance with subsection (2) of \u00a7 46-20-103, MCA, which provides \u201c[t]he State may appeal from any court order or judgment the substantive effect of which results in ... (h) imposing a sentence that is contrary to law,\u201d the DOC filed an objection to Jivelekas\u2019s motion requesting approval to operate a motor vehicle. The DOC argued that based on \u00a7 61-8-731, MCA, the District Court had no authority to entertain a motion to grant Jivelekas permission to operate a motor vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b230-8\">\u00b617  On appeal, the DOC asks this Court to conclude that the District Court exceeded its scope of authority when it granted Jivelekas\u2019s motion for approval to operate a motor vehicle. We are precluded, however, from addressing the merits of this argument because the DOC failed to file a timely appeal under Rule 5(b), <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"211\">*211</page-number>M.R.App.P. The Rule states that \u201c[a]n appeal from an order or judgment made appealable by section 46-20-103, Montana Code Annotated must be taken within 14 days.\u201d The District Court filed its judgment and order sentencing Jivelekas on April 25, 2002. Consequently, the DOC should have filed its appeal within fourteen days of April 25, 2002. Instead, the DOC filed an appeal on May 17, 2004. While \u00a7 46-18-116(3), MCA, provides that \u201c[t]he court may correct a factually erroneous sentence or judgment at any time,\u201d the statute clearly states that <em>\u201c[ijllegal sentences </em>must be addressed in the manner provided by law for appeal....\u201d (Emphasis added.) Since the DOC\u2019s appeal is not within the fourteen-day period provided by law, Rule 5(b), M.R.App.P., the appeal is time-barred.</p>\n<p id=\"b231-4\">\u00b618 This appeal is dismissed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b231-5\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES RICE, WARNER, COTTER, NELSON and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
