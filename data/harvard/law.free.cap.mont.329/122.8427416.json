Flynn appeals from the Order of the Montana Workers\u2019 Compensation Court denying both his Petition for Hearing and Motion for Reconsideration. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-10\">\u00b62 We consider the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b145-11\">\u00b63 Does Rule 6(e), M.R.Civ.P., add three extra days to the ninety-day period provided by \u00a7 39-71-520, MCA (2001), for a claimant to request mediation following a determination by the Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund that is mailed to the claimant?</p>\n<p id=\"b145-12\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b145-13\">\u00b64 On July 25,2002, Petitioner William H. Flynn (Flynn) injured his back while lifting his employer, Dean Casterline (Casterline), out of a wheelchair. As Casterline did not have workers\u2019 compensation insurance, Flynn filed a claim with the Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund (UEF).</p>\n<p id=\"b145-14\">\u00b65 Following review, UEF Claims Adjuster Bernadette Rice (Rice) issued a determination denying Flynn\u2019s claim, concluding that his injury resulted from household and domestic services, tasks which are statutorily exempted from the requirements of coverage under the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act. UEF\u2019s determination was dated November 21, 2002, and the mailing to Flynn was post-marked November 25, 2002, four days after the determination had been actually made.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-15\">\u00b66 The letter of determination cited \u00a7 39-71-520, MCA (2001), of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Act, explaining Flynn\u2019s option to \u201cappeal to mediation\u201d within ninety days of Rice\u2019s decision under that statute. The letter also explained that if Flynn did not request mediation within ninety days, the matter would be deemed closed.</p>\n<p id=\"b145-16\">\u00b67 Flynn contacted Rice by phone on December 10, 2002, to discuss her determination, but he did not request mediation until February 22, 2002-ninety-three days after UEF\u2019s determination of November 21, 2002. Nevertheless, the Mediation Unit undertook Flynn\u2019s claim, opining that the ninety-day time limit did not begin until either the <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"126\">*126</page-number>date of the determination\u2019s mailing, or the date that Flynn received the determination. Since the UEF\u2019s determination was mailed on November 25, 2002, use of that date allowed Flynn\u2019s February 22, 2003, request for mediation to be considered timely.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-4\">\u00b68 The Mediation Unit issued its report on May 7, 2003. In addition to its recommendations for resolution of the matter, it noted that Flynn\u2019s mediation request could only be timely if the ninety-day time period ran from his receipt of UEF\u2019s determination, rather than the date the determination had been issued.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-5\">\u00b69 Dissatisfied with the mediation report, Flynn filed a Petition for Hearing with the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court on May 12,2004, over one year after the May 7,2003, issuance of the mediation report. That court denied the petition, and Flynn\u2019s subsequent Motion for Reconsideration on the grounds that the request for mediation was untimely because it had been filed more than ninety days after the UEF\u2019s determination. The court concluded that, as a result, it lacked jurisdiction to hear the case.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-6\">\u00b610 Flynn appealed to this Court on November 19, 2004.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-7\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b146-8\">\u00b611 The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s order relied on conclusions of law. This Court reviews that tribunal\u2019s conclusions of law <em>de novo, </em>the standard being whether the interpretation of law was correct. <em>Stordalen v. Ricci\u2019s Food Farm </em>(1993), 261 Mont. 256, 258, 862 P.2d 393, 394.</p>\n<p id=\"b146-9\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b146-10\">\u00b612 The State of Montana created the Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund (UEF) in 1977 to protect workers employed by uninsured employers. The UEF claims process begins when an injured employee files a First Report of Injury, which is assigned to a UEF claims adjuster who reviews the claim and makes a decision denying or granting benefits. Section 39-71-520, MCA (2001), grants a claimant the right to appeal the decision to the Mediation Unit within a ninety-day period. It provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b146-11\">Time limit to appeal. A dispute concerning uninsured employers\u2019 fund benefits must be appealed to mediation within 90 days <em>from the date of the determination or the determination is considered final.</em></blockquote>\n<p id=\"b146-12\">Section 39-71-520, MCA (2001) (emphasis added). Thus, a claimant wishing to request mediation must do so within ninety days of UEF\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"127\">*127</page-number>\u00b613 If a claimant appeals to the mediation unit and is unsatisfied with the outcome, he or she may appeal to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court. However, \u00a7 39-71-2408, MCA (2001), requires mediation before \u201ceither party may file a petition in the workers\u2019 compensation court.\u201d As noted in \u00a7 39-71-2406, MCA (2001), the purpose of the mediation requirement is to:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-3\">prevent when possible the filing in the workers\u2019 compensation court of actions by claimants or insurers relating to claims under chapter 71 or 72 of this title if an equitable and reasonable resolution of the dispute may be effected at an earlier stage.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AsBl\">Section 39-71-2406, MCA (2001). Failure to request mediation within ninety days prevents a party from seeking review of a UEF determination by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court. See \u00a7\u00a7 39-71-2408 and 39-71-2905, MCA (2001). As such, if Flynn\u2019s February 22, 2003, request for mediation was beyond the ninety-day statutory period, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court\u2019s denial of Flynn\u2019s petition must be affirmed.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-4\">\u00b614 Flynn argues that his request for mediation was timely, and in contrast to the reasoning of the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court, argues that the ninety-day statutory period should begin to run, not from the date of the UEF determination, but rather, from the date the UEF determination was mailed. Further, Flynn argues that the three extra days provided by Rule 6(e), M.R.Civ.P., when service is by mail, is applicable to the time period under \u00a7 39-71-520, MCA (2001), citing <em>MCI Telecommunications Corp. v. Montana Dept. of Public Service Regulation </em>(1993), 260 Mont. 175, 858 P.2d 364, in support. Rule 6(e), M.R.Civ.P., states that:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b147-5\">whenever a party has the right or is required to do some act or take some proceedings within a prescribed period after the service of a notice or other paper upon the party and the notice or paper is served upon the party by mail, 3 days shall be added to the prescribed period.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b147-6\">For the following reasons, Flynn\u2019s argument fails.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-7\">\u00b615 First, <em>MCI Telecommunications </em>does not stand for the proposition that Rule 6(e), M.R.Civ.P., applies to every administrative appeal. To the contrary, <em>MCI Telecommunications </em>held that \u201c[w]here the time for filing an appeal is dictated by the statute which confers the right to appeal, Rule 6(e) cannot be applied to extend the time for filing as this would be an extension of the court\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d <em>MCI Telecommunications, </em>260 Mont. at 178, 858 P.2d at 366.</p>\n<p id=\"b147-8\">\u00b616 While the Court in <em>MCI Telecommunications </em>ultimately determined Rule 6(e), M.R.Civ.P., was applicable to the statute at issue <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"128\">*128</page-number>in that case, that statute differed significantly from \u00a7 39-71-520, MCA (2001). The statute at issue in <em>MCI Telecommunications, </em>\u00a7 2-4-702, MCA (1991), a provision of the Montana Administrative Procedure Act, required the filing of an appeal \u201cwithin 30 days <em>after service </em>of the final decision.\u201d Section 2-4-702, MCA (emphasis added). As we noted therein, the term \u201cservice\u201d was undefined in the statutory scheme at issue, and therefore created confusion as to when \u201cservice\u201d was effective. In response, the Court applied Rule 6(e), M.R.Civ.P., moving the statutory time window three days in favor of the appealing party. The Court reasoned that \u201c[i]n this case, the time to appeal is not dictated by any statute which prescribes that service is complete when placed in the mail ....\u2019\u2019MCI Telecommunications, 260 Mont. at 178, 858 P.2d at 366.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-4\">\u00b617  In contrast to the statute at issue in <em>MCI Communications, </em>\u00a7 39-71-520, MCA (2001), does not rely on \u201cservice\u201d as the basis for commencing the ninety-day time period. Instead, the statute\u2019s ninety-day mediation request window runs \u201cfrom the date of the determination ....\u201d Section 39-71-520, MCA (2001). Therefore, unlike the statute in <em>MCI Telecommunications, </em>\u00a7 39-71-520, MCA (2001), is not subject to, nor does it need, the assistance of Rule 6(e), M.R.Civ.P. For that reason, we conclude that Rule 6(e), M.R.Civ.P., is not applicable to \u00a7 39-71-520, MCA (2001), and hold that the ninety-day time period to request mediation under \u00a7 39-71-520, MCA (2001), begins to run on the date of the UEF\u2019s determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b148-5\">\u00b618  UEF\u2019s determination was made on November 21, 2002. As a result, Flynn had until February 19, 2002, to request mediation. However, Flynn did not request mediation until February 22,2002. As such, Flynn\u2019s request was time barred, and UEF\u2019s determination became unappealable. At that point, neither the Mediation Unit nor the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court could hear the matter. Therefore, the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court correctly denied Flynn\u2019s petition.</p>\n<p id=\"AvR\">\u00b619 Alternatively, UEF and Dean Casterline argue that because Flynn filed his petition with the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court more than one year after issuance of the mediator\u2019s report, the petition was time barred under \u00a7 39-71-520(2)(c), MCA (2003). That statute provides that parties must appeal to the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court within sixty days of a mediation report. However, because we have already concluded that Flynn\u2019s petition was time barred under \u00a7 39-71-520, MCA (2001), we need not address the application of \u00a7 39-71-520(2)(c), MCA (2003).</p>\n<p id=\"b148-6\">\u00b620 The Workers\u2019 Compensation Court is affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b148-7\">JUSTICES COTTER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"10\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-2\" type=\"concurrence\">\n<author id=\"b149-2\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"129\">*129</page-number>JUSTICE NELSON</author>\n<p id=\"Ayr\">concurs.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-3\">\u00b621 I concur in our resolution of this appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-4\">\u00b622 The Court refers to the ninety-day time period of \u00a7 39-71-520, MCA (2001), without noting the \u201cdispute\u201d requirement disclosed by the plain language of the statute. This is consistent with the Court\u2019s recent interpretation of \u00a7 39-71-520, MCA (1999), rendered in <em>Colmore v. Uninsured Employers\u2019 Fund, </em>2005 MT 239, 328 Mont. 441, 121 P.3d 1007.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-5\">\u00b623 I dissented as to the Court\u2019s statutory interpretation in <em>Colmore, </em>and I remain convinced that the Court erred in this regard. However, even if the Court had properly interpreted \u00a7 39-71-520, MCA (1999), in <em>Colmore, </em>the result in this case would not be different.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-6\">\u00b624 Thus, I concur.</p>\n</opinion>\n<opinion data-order=\"11\" data-type=\"opinion\" id=\"x999-3\" type=\"dissent\">\n<author id=\"b149-7\">JUSTICE WARNER</author>\n<p id=\"AR\">dissents.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-8\">\u00b625 I dissent from the dismissal of Flynn\u2019s claim under \u00a7 39-71-520, MCA (2001). The Court phrases the issue as whether Rule 6(e), M.R.Civ.P., adds three additional days to the ninety-day period provided in \u00a7 39-71-520, MCA (2001), for the claimant to request mediation following a determination by the UEF that is mailed to the claimant. I conclude that Flynn requested mediation within the ninety-day limit, and it is therefore unnecessary to address whether he had an additional three days.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-9\">\u00b626 As recognized by the Court at \u00b6 7, if the UEF determination was made the date the letter containing notice of such was mailed, the mediation request was then made within the ninety days provided. I would hold that the determination was indeed made on the date the letter was mailed, that is, left the offices of the UEF.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-10\">\u00b627 The only justification given by the Workers\u2019 Compensation Judge in holding that the ninety-day period began to run when the letter was dated is that he felt there was still plenty of time to request mediation, regardless of any delay by the UEF. The Court, for no stated reason, also holds that the ninety-day limit for appeal under \u00a7 39-71-520, MCA (2001), begins on the date typed in the letter notifying Flynn his claim was denied. I disagree.</p>\n<p id=\"b149-11\">\u00b628 Section 39-71-520, MCA (2001), provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b149-12\">A dispute concerning uninsured employers\u2019 fund benefits must be appealed to mediation within 90 days from the date of the determination or the determination is considered final.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b149-13\">\u00b629 To \u201cdetermine\u201d means \u201cto decide, to adjudicate, to come to a decision, to decide upon an investigation, to perform a judicial act.\u201d <em>Subsequent Injury Fund v. Ladow </em>(Colo.App., 1996), 923 P.2d 368, 369. In my view the ninety-day period was intended to begin when the UEF <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"130\">*130</page-number>\u201cdetermination\u201d was definite. In this instance the letter bearing the bad news for Flynn was typed and dated on Thursday, November 21, 2002. There is no indication in the record when it was signed. It likely sat on someone\u2019s desk Friday, November 22,2002, as well as Saturday and Sunday, November 23 and 24, 2002. Thus, it can hardly be said that the letter was a determination on Thursday, as all that was necessary to change it was to take it <em>off </em>the desk and throw it away. At some point on Monday, November 25, the signed letter was placed in the mail to Flynn. This is when it became a UEF determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-4\">\u00b630 The time to appeal an administrative decision should not begin to run until the appealing party knew or should have known of the decision. 2 Am. Jur. 2d <em>Administrative Law, </em>\u00a7 535 (2004). Section 37-71-520, MCA (2001), gives the appellant ninety days to appeal. Therefore the appellant should have his ninety days; not ninety days less the four days it took UEF to type, review, sign, and finally mail the letter. Such an objective standard seems reasonable, as once the determination is postmarked it is in the possession of the postal service, a neutral third-party, and it can no longer be changed or edited. Conversely, by using the date on the letter, the standard becomes subjective and arbitrary, as was the case here. In my view the Legislature did not intend to create a standard that would allow the UEF to burn several days of the ninety-day period simply by dating the notice and sitting on it for a few days prior to actually mailing it.</p>\n<p id=\"Amt\">\u00b631 The Court supports its conclusion by citing the purpose for the mediation requirement, specifically that mediation discourages unnecessary filings in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court where \u201can equitable and reasonable resolution [mediation] ... may be effected at an earlier stage.\u201d \u00b6 13.1 fail to see how using the date of the letter, as opposed to the date it was mailed, supports mediation. Either way, if the appellant misses the ninety-day period, no appeal can be taken from the UEF determination. The Court\u2019s rationale only serves to give Flynn less time to request mediation.</p>\n<p id=\"b150-5\">\u00b632 The mediator\u2019s report was issued May 7, 2003. Flynn filed his petition in the Workers\u2019 Compensation Court on May 12, 2004, over a year later. I would remand this matter to the WCC to consider whether Flynn\u2019s appeal of the mediator\u2019s determination was timely, and if so, the WCC must then consider the merits of his claim.</p>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
