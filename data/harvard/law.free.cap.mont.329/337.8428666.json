(Appellants), appeal the District Court\u2019s legal declaration of her biological father\u2019s paternity and Order directing the parties to devise a parenting plan for visitation and support. C.P. and G.P. also request a stay of judgment from the District Court Order, while Respondent, J.D., the biological father, requests costs and attorney fees associated with this Appeal. We affirm the District Court, and deny both the Appellants\u2019 request for a stay, and Respondent\u2019s request for costs and attorney fees.</p>\n<p id=\"b360-9\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b360-10\">\u00b62 The restated issues on appeal are:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-11\">1. Did the District Court err when it allowed a rebuttal of G.P.\u2019s presumed paternity?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-12\">2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it applied Montana\u2019s \u201cbest interest of the child\u201d standard to recognize J.D.\u2019s paternity?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-13\">3. Should this Court issue a stay of the District Court Order?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b360-14\">4. Is J.D. entitled to costs and attorney fees resulting from this appeal?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b360-15\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b360-16\">\u00b63 K.P., the now three-year old child at the heart of this paternity dispute, was conceived during an extra-marital affair between her mother, C.P., and J.D. The affair occurred while C.P. was temporarily estranged from her husband, G.P. Shortly after finding out she was pregnant, C.P. reconciled with G.P., who with full knowledge of the affair and C.P.\u2019s pregnancy, forgave his wife and then supported her through her pregnancy. G.P. participated in KP.\u2019s birth, signed KP.\u2019s birth certificate as her father, and thereafter held K.P. out as his child. During the eighth month of C.P.\u2019s pregnancy, C.P. and G.P. asked J.D. to relinquish any paternity claim and allow them to raise the baby in <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"341\">*341</page-number>their family. J.D. declined, and then fearing C.P. and G.P. would prevent contact between him and the child, on July 12, 2002, J.D. petitioned the District Court for a determination of paternity.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-4\">\u00b64 On August 1, 2002, the District Court held a hearing on J.D.\u2019s Petition for Determination of Paternity. At that time, C.P.\u2019s and G.P.\u2019s attorney acknowledged that under Montana law J.D. had a right to request genetic testing to determine whether he was the biological father of C.P.\u2019s yet unborn child. Neither C.P. nor G.P. objected to testing. Moreover, both knew it was unlikely G.P. was the biological father of the child because he had a vasectomy several years prior. As C.P., G.P., and J.D. all agreed to submit to DNA testing, the District Court ordered them each to provide samples for testing within 30 days of the child\u2019s birth.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-5\">\u00b65 DNA testing conclusively showed that J.D. was the biological father of K.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-6\">\u00b66 In October 2002, the District Court referred this case to Family Court Services (Family Court). In December 2002, J.D. began weekly visitation with K.P. who was then four months old. Initially J.D. was allowed one 30-minute visit per week supervised by the staff at the Nurturing Center in Kalispell, which supervision J.D. arranged. Gradually the duration of KP.\u2019s visits increased, and moved to J.D.\u2019s home as approved by Family Court. During the visits observed by Family Court\u2019s Director, J.D. was \u201ccontinually ... on time[,] ... interested in visits, [and] acted appropriately at visits.\u201d Then, in May 2003, following an incident between J.D. and C.P., G.P. disallowed subsequent visitation.</p>\n<p id=\"b361-7\">\u00b67 On May 29, 2003, Family Court filed its Parenting Plan Evaluation and Report with the District Court recommending K.P. be given \u201cevery opportunity to know, love, and be cared for by her biological father.\u201d Family Court\u2019s recommendation was based on: interviews, responses to questionnaires, joint meetings, and home visits with the parties; interviews with professionals involved with the case; interviews with the parties\u2019 personal references; observation of KP.\u2019s interactions with the parties; and reviews of criminal and other court information. Given KP.\u2019s young age, and the loving home provided by C.P. and G.P., Family Court further recommended that K.P. stay in her mother\u2019s primary care, so long as she and G.P. did not deny J.D. visitation, with gradual implementation of parenting time for J.D. Family Court emphasized that K.P. was at a \u201csignificant stage of her development,\u201d and that \u201cto date, the experiences [C.P.] and [G.P.] have provided in regard to [K.P.]\u2019s association with her natural <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"342\">*342</page-number>father are distorted and sad.\u201d Family Court recommended that should C.P. and G.P. continue to prevent meaningful interaction between J.D. and K.P., K.P. be placed in J.D.\u2019s primary care.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-4\">\u00b68 J.D. then filed a motion for implementation of an interim parenting plan, for which the District Court held a hearing on June 23, 2003. The court then appointed a guardian ad litem (GAL) to prepare a report regarding KP.\u2019s best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-5\">\u00b69 At the June 2003 hearing, Appellants\u2019 pastor and counselor both testified they believed K.P.\u2019s best interests would be served by C.P.\u2019s and G.P.\u2019s plan for KP.\u2019s upbringing. They expressed their hope that K.P. would grow up without contact with, nor knowledge of J.D., until she reached an age of maturity when C.P. and G.P. could tell her about the circumstances of her conception, and allow her to decide whether to establish a relationship with J.D. In the interim, C.P. would periodically inform J.D. of K.P.\u2019s well-being through photos, medical records, and letters from C.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-6\">\u00b610 The Director of Family Court also testified. On cross-examination, she stated that it is in KP.\u2019s \u201cbest interests to have a relationship with her father, [J.D.].\u201d The Director based her opinion on the investigation she conducted in preparing her written Report, as well as her professional experience and \u201cknowledge of children and their relationships with their parents ... where children seem to have some need-I would even go so far as to call it an innate need-to know their biological parents.... I believe that [K.P.] should be given the opportunity now, rather than to wait until she is 14 and [sic]-or 15 years old and put a decision like that on her....\u201d KP.\u2019s GAL, after extensive investigation including her own interviews with the parties and others, and observations of K.P. with the parties, agreed with the Director\u2019s assessment.</p>\n<p id=\"b362-7\">\u00b611 The District Court, after hearing the evidence, and considering the recommendations of Family Court and KP.\u2019s GAL, issued Findings of Fact, Conclusions of Law, and Judgment on December 9, 2003, concluding that \u201cthe best interests of [K.P.] would be served by recognizing the paternity of [J.D.] and by gradually establishing a parent/child relationship....\u201d Specifically the District Court found: J.D. maintains suitable housing, and acquired appropriate furnishings to care for his young daughter; both KP.\u2019s mother and J.D. provide a \u201cstable and healthy home environment\u201d for K.P; since before KP.\u2019s birth, J.D. demonstrated a \u201cfull commitment to the responsibilities of parenting [her];\u201d and J.D. has maintained continuous employment, purchased medical insurance for K.P., and paid child support into a <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"343\">*343</page-number>banking account in KP.\u2019s name. The District Court ordered that a parent-child relationship be established between K.P. and J.D., and that the parties exchange final parenting plans and develop a support plan for K.P.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-4\">\u00b612 Following the District Court\u2019s entry of judgment, C.P. and G.P. filed numerous motions, including an untimely motion for new trial, a petition to terminate J.D.\u2019s parental rights, a petition for adoption, and two consecutive motions to stay the District Court\u2019s Judgment. J.D. then filed a motion for contempt because C.P. and G.P. repeatedly resisted J.D.\u2019s attempts to exercise visitation. Notably, however, despite the flurry of motions filed by both parties, J.D. failed to file a notice of entry of judgment after the District Court ruled in his favor in December 2003. A year later, on December 13, 2004, C.P. and G.P. filed a Notice of Entry of the December 2003 Judgment, and immediately thereafter filed a Notice of Appeal?</p>\n<p id=\"b363-5\">\u00b613 We require prevailing parties to serve a notice of entry of judgment \u201cbefore the thirty day deadline for filing notice of appeal begins to run.\u201d <em>Quantum Electric, Inc., v. Schaeffer, </em>2003 MT 29, \u00b6 29, 314 Mont. 193, \u00b6 29, 64 P.3d 1026, \u00b6 29 (citations omitted). Moreover, such notice may be filed by either party. Rule 77(d), M.R.Civ.P., <em>In re Estate of Spencer, </em>2002 MT 304, \u00b6 18, 313 Mont. 40, \u00b6 18, 59 P.3d 1160, \u00b6 18. Because C.P. and G.P. filed a Notice of Entry of Judgment followed by a timely Notice of Appeal, this matter is properly before us. We now turn to the merits of the appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b363-7\">\u00b614 Did the District Court err when it allowed G.P\u2019s presumed paternity to be rebutted with genetic testing?</p>\n<p id=\"b363-8\">\u00b615 Appellants failed to preserve this issue for appeal when they did not object to the DNA testing at the hearing on J.D.\u2019s Petition for Determination of Paternity. To properly preserve an issue for appeal, a party must notify the court at the time the objectionable conduct is at issue. <em>Jenks v. Bertelsen, </em>2004 MT 50, \u00b6 12, 320 Mont. 139, \u00b6 12, 86 P.3d 24, \u00b6 12. Untimely objections are not heard on appeal, as the time for correcting the error has passed. <em>State v. Vandersloot, </em>2003 MT 179, \u00b6 23, 316 Mont. 405, \u00b6 23, 73 P.3d 174. \u00b6 23. Failure to make a timely objection constitutes a waiver. <em>Hunt v. K-Mart Corp., </em>1999 MT 125, \u00b6 10, 294 Mont. 444, \u00b6 10, 981 P.2d 275, \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b363-9\">\u00b616  Here, C.P. and G.P. voluntarily waived the presumption of G.P.\u2019s paternity when they failed to object to the District Court\u2019s order that the testing take place. Not only did they not object to the DNA <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"344\">*344</page-number>testing, but they both agreed to participate, even while they must have known G.P. was not likely the father because he had a vasectomy years prior. Only after the District Court made its final determination in this case did Appellants object for the first time to the rebuttal of G.P.\u2019s presumed paternity. We conclude that their failure to object at the hearing when the District Court ordered DNA testing constituted a waiver of Appellants\u2019 rights to appeal this issue.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-4\">ISSUE TWO</p>\n<p id=\"b364-5\">\u00b617 Did the District Court abuse its discretion when it determined it was in K.P.\u2019s best interest to recognize J.D.\u2019s paternity?</p>\n<p id=\"b364-6\">\u00b618 We review a district court\u2019s application of the \u201cbest interest of the child\u201d standard and declaration of paternity for an abuse of discretion. <em>Matter of Paternity of Adam </em>(1995), 273 Mont. 351, 358, 903 P.2d 207, 211. A trial court abuses its discretion when it \u201cact[s] arbitrarily without employment of conscientious judgment or exceed[s] the bounds of reason resulting in substantial injustice.\u201d <em>In re Paternity of C.T.E.-H., </em>2004 MT 307, \u00b6 16, 323 Mont. 498, \u00b6 16, 101 P.3d 254, \u00b6 16 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b364-7\">\u00b619 In <em>Paternity of Adam, </em>this Court explicitly adopted the \u201cbest interest of the child\u201d standard for resolving paternity disputes under Montana\u2019s Uniform Parentage Act (UPA). 273 Mont. at 357, 903 P.2d at 211. Later, in <em>Girard v. Williams, </em>we reviewed the statutory framework set out in Montana\u2019s UPA by which the legal parent-child relationship maybe established, and recognized that \u201conce a paternity action is initiated under the UPA, a court may determine whether a judicial declaration of a father-child relationship would be in the best interests of a child,\u201d which declaration may also provide for visitation, support, and other provisions. 1998 MT 231, \u00b6 21, 291 Mont. 49, \u00b6 21, 966 P.2d 1155, \u00b6 21, outlining \u00a7\u00a7 40-6-109, 40-6-111 to 114 and 116, MCA, reiterated in In <em>re the Parenting of D.A.H., </em>2005 MT 68, \u00b6 8, 326 Mont. 296, \u00b6 8, 109 P.3d 247, \u00b6 8.</p>\n<p id=\"b364-8\">\u00b620 This Court has consistently honored the rights involved in relationships between natural parents and their children. We have also recognized that mere biology does not automatically warrant the legal rights and responsibilities accompanying a determination of paternity. <em>Compare Girard, </em>1998 MT 231, 291 Mont. 49, 966 P.2d 1155, (where we discussed the \u201cbest interest of the child\u201d test\u2019s applicability to paternity disputes, and denied to non-parent caretakers the standing to challenge the natural father\u2019s request for custody of his two children who lived with the caretakers for an <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"345\">*345</page-number>extended period while he was incarcerated), with <em>Paternity of Adam, </em>273 Mont. 351, 903 P.2d 207, (where we affirmed that a judicial declaration of the natural father\u2019s paternity was not in the best interest of the child because the natural father did little to establish a parent-child relationship or provide care and support for his son despite financial ability and father\u2019s knowledge of paternity). In addition, we have relied on the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s guidance as well. <em>See Paternity of Adam, </em>273 Mont. at 354, 903 P.2d at 209, <em>Girard, </em>at \u00b6 67 (in dissent), and <em>In re C.R.O., </em>2002 MT 50, \u00b6 66, 309 Mont. 48, \u00b6 66, 43 P.3d 913, \u00b6 66 (in dissent), citing <em>Lehr v. Robertson </em>(1983), 463 U.S. 248, 103 S.Ct. 2985, 77 L.Ed.2d 614.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b365-4\">The significance of the biological connection is that it offers the natural father an opportunity that no other male possesses to develop a relationship with his offspring. If he grasps that opportunity and accepts some measure of responsibility for the child\u2019s future, he may enjoy the blessings of the parent-child relationship and make uniquely valuable contributions to the child\u2019s development. If he fails to do so, the Federal Constitution will not automatically compel a State to listen to his opinion of where the child\u2019s best interests lie.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b365-5\"><em>Paternity of Adam, </em>273 Mont. at 355, 903 P.2d at 209, quoting <em>Lehr, </em>463 U.S. at 262, 103 S.Ct. at 2993-94, 77 L.Ed.2d at 627.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-6\">\u00b621 In Montana, biology is a \u201cweighty factor\u201d in applying the best interest standard, but not the \u201ccontrolling consideration.\u201d <em>Paternity of Adam, </em>273 Mont. at 357, 903 P.2d at 211. Once a biological connection is established, a court must weigh that factor against other evidence of the parent\u2019s commitment to caring for the child, and fulfilling the role of a \u201cparent\u201d acting in the best interests of his child.</p>\n<p id=\"b365-7\">\u00b622 We require courts to evaluate specific criteria when determining the best interests of children in paternity disputes. In these cases, a court must consider: \u201cthe existence of a home environment; the stability of the present home and family; the extent to which uncertainty of parentage already exists in the child\u2019s mind; the efforts and commitments ... the putative father has taken to establish supportive and financial ties with the child; as well as any other factors which may be relevant in assessing the potential benefits or detriments to the child.\u201d <em>Paternity of Adam, </em>273 Mont. at 357-58, 903 P.2d at 211. A court\u2019s conclusion that a paternity declaration is in the best interest of a child must be based on facts in the record. <em>Paternity of Adam, </em>273 Mont. at 357, 903 P.2d at 210-11 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b365-8\">\u00b623 Here, the District Court evaluated the criteria sanctioned by this <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"346\">*346</page-number>Court for determining a child\u2019s best interest, and relying on evidence in the record, determined that recognizing J.D.\u2019s paternity was in K.P.\u2019s best interest. We find no abuse of discretion in this decision. The record reflects that J.D. maintains suitable housing and appropriate furnishings to care for K.P.; J.D. provides a \u201cstable and healthy home environment\u201d for K.P; since before K.P.\u2019s birth, J.D. has demonstrated a \u201cfull commitment to the responsibilities of parenting [her];\u201d and J.D. remains employed, provides K.P. with medical insurance, and pays child support into a banking account in K.P.\u2019s name.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-4\">\u00b624 Additionally, the District Court\u2019s determination of paternity comports with testimony provided at trial by the Family Court Director and K.P.\u2019s GAL, both of whom opined a parent-child relationship between J.D. and K.P. would best serve her long-term well-being. The Director testified that it is in K.P.\u2019s \u201cbest interests to have a relationship with her father, [J.D.],\u201d and that children have an \u201cinnate need\u201d to know their natural parents. K.P.\u2019s GAL concluded that legally recognizing J.D.\u2019s paternity, to immediately foster a meaningful relationship between K.P. and him, would serve KP.\u2019s best interests.</p>\n<p id=\"b366-5\">\u00b625 Further, the record reflects that throughout this dispute, J.D. has made consistent efforts to spend time with K.P. and develop a relationship with her. Despite C.P.\u2019s and G.P.\u2019s repeated efforts to stall and prevent visitation, J.D. consistently made his availability for visits known through counsel, arranged for the supervision of his visits with K.P. with the Nurturing Center when the District Court required it, and according to Family Services has \u201ccontinually been on time for visits, been interested in visits, [and] acted appropriately at visits.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"Alc\">\u00b626 This case stands in stark contrast to <em>Paternity of Adam, </em>where the district court applied the same criteria for determining the child\u2019s best interest but issued the opposite ruling. In <em>Paternity of Adam, </em>the blood bond between Adam and the petitioner was undisputed, as here. However, in that case, the natural father \u201cdemonstrated no personal commitment to or responsibility for Adam,\u201d the father had neither suitable housing nor employment, and he failed to provide support of any kind. Adam\u2019s mother and her husband, on the other hand, shared a \u201cstrong emotional relationship\u201d with Adam, a stable marital relationship with each other, and provided Adam with financial stability in a safe and suitable home where Adam was \u201cloved and well cared for.\u201d <em>Paternity of Adam, </em>273 Mont. at 358, 903 P.2d at 211. We affirmed that a declaration of paternity in Adam\u2019s natural father, who had failed to perform as a parent, was not in Adam\u2019s best interest. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"347\">*347</page-number>Here, while C.P. and G.P. unquestionably provide K.P. with an excellent home, we must analyze what J.D. brings to KP.\u2019s life. J.D. has demonstrated the qualities of parenthood which warrant a judicial declaration of J.D.\u2019s paternity, and which justify giving K.P. the opportunity to know and love her natural father.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-4\">\u00b627 Appellants maintain the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s ruling in <em>Michael H. v. Gerald D., </em>should control this Court. (1989), 491 U.S. 110, 109 S.Ct. 2333, 105 L.Ed.2d 91. We disagree. The seminal question addressed in <em>Michael H. </em>was whether the due process provisions of the U.S. Constitution grant a party other than a husband or wife the right to challenge the paternity of a child bom to the wife. Appellants here correctly contend that, in keeping with the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s ruling, neither the Constitution, nor the long-held social policy of protecting the legitimacy of children born to unitary families, offers natural fathers a vehicle for asserting paternity <em>where state law denies that opportunity. </em>However, the <em>Michael H. </em>Court expressly acknowledged that \u201cit is a question of legislative policy and not constitutional law whether [a state] will allow the presumed parenthood of a couple desiring to retain a child conceived within and bom into their marriage to be rebutted.\u201d 491 U.S. at 129-30, 109 S.Ct. at 2345, 105 L.Ed.2d at 110.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-5\">\u00b628 Montana\u2019s lawmakers have exercised their prerogative to allow the rebuttal of a husband\u2019s presumed paternity by third-parties to the marriage. In Montana, a husband is presumed to be the natural father of children born to his wife during their marriage. Section 40-6-105(l)(a), MCA. However, the husband\u2019s presumed paternity may be rebutted by a preponderance of evidence, or by blood test results which disprove his paternity. Section 40-6-105(3). Consequently, the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s ruling upholding a California law, which prevented Michael H. and his natural daughter from challenging the presumed paternity of her mother\u2019s husband, has no bearing on this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b367-6\">\u00b629  C.P. and G.P. also contend that, despite the copious evidence relied on by the District Court, recognizing J.D.\u2019s paternity still is not in KP.\u2019s best interest because J.D. did not pay medical expenses occasioned by K.P.\u2019s delivery. Section 40-4-212(j), MCA, specifies that if a parent knowingly fails to pay birth-related costs the parent is able to pay, it is not in the child\u2019s best interest. However, payment of \u201cbirth related costs are non-exclusive factors to be considered with all factors when determining the best interests of the child.\u201d <em>Paternity of C.T.E.</em>H., \u00b6\u00b6 40-41. In weighing the evidence before it, the District Court determined that, on balance, sufficient evidence was presented to <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"348\">*348</page-number>extend to J.D. the opportunity, uniquely afforded him by biology, to parent his child. We find no abuse of discretion by the District Court in making its determination.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-4\">ISSUE THREE</p>\n<p id=\"b368-5\">\u00b630 Should this Court issue a stay of the District Court Order?</p>\n<p id=\"b368-6\">\u00b631 Because we conclude the District Court did not abuse its discretion when it declared J.D\u2019s paternity, and ordered the parties to devise a parenting plan that would allow for both visitation with, and support for, K.P, Appellants\u2019 request for a stay of the District Court Order is denied as moot.</p>\n<p id=\"b368-7\">ISSUE FOUR</p>\n<p id=\"b368-8\">\u00b632  Is J.D. entitled to reasonable costs and attorney fees resulting from this appeal?</p>\n<p id=\"b368-9\">\u00b633 J.D. claims this appeal was intended to cause delay, and is an abuse of the judicial system.
