He appeals on the grounds that the jury was impaneled improperly and that the District Court gave an erroneous jury instruction for the charge of criminal endangerment. We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-9\">ISSUES</p>\n<p id=\"b559-10\">\u00b62 A restatement of the issues on appeal is:</p>\n<p id=\"b559-11\">\u00b63 Was Azure\u2019s jury venire improperly impaneled?</p>\n<p id=\"b559-12\">\u00b64 Did the District Court correctly instruct the jury on the elements of criminal endangerment?</p>\n<p id=\"b559-13\">FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b559-14\">\u00b65 Azure was charged with deliberate homicide, attempted deliberate homicide and criminal mischief on February 27,1997. He was tried in October 1997, and convicted of deliberate homicide, mitigated attempted deliberate homicide and criminal mischief. We affirmed his conviction in 2002. The underlying facts pertinent to Azure\u2019s original charges and earlier trial have been detailed in <em>State v. Azure, </em>2002 MT 22, 308 Mont. 201, 41 P.3d 899, and will not be repeated here.</p>\n<p id=\"b559-15\">\u00b66 In February 2003, Azure petitioned for postconviction relief claiming that the jury selection process of his 1997 trial violated his constitutional rights. The District Court granted Azure\u2019s Petition in November 2003. On December 9, 2003, the State filed an Amended Information charging Azure with deliberate homicide and felony criminal endangerment. In preparation for the January 12,2004, jury trial, the Cascade County Clerk of Court (clerk) began compiling the jury pool. On January 9, 2004, Azure challenged the panel, arguing it <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"540\">*540</page-number>had not been drawn randomly, as required by statute. The District Court heard the matter on January 12, 2004, and denied Azure\u2019s challenge. The trial commenced on the same day, and Azure was convicted on January 15, 2004. The court sentenced him on March 3, 2004, imposing the same sentence it had imposed six years earlier, i.e., one hundred (100) years to Montana State Prison (MSP) for deliberate homicide, with an additional ten (10) years for the use of a dangerous weapon in the commission of the crime, and ten (10) years to MSP for criminal endangerment, with an additional two (2) years for the use of a dangerous weapon. The sentences total one hundred twenty-two (122) years and run consecutively. Azure filed a timely appeal.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b560-5\">\u00b67 The District Court\u2019s decision to deny Azure\u2019s challenge to the composition of the jury was a conclusion of law. Our standard of review for a district court\u2019s conclusions of law is plenary and we must determine whether the court\u2019s conclusions are correct as a matter of law. <em>State v. Bingman, </em>2002 MT 350, \u00b6 55, 313 Mont. 376, \u00b6 55, 61 P.3d 153, \u00b6 55 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b560-6\">\u00b68 We review jury instructions to determine whether the instructions as a whole fully and fairly instruct the jury on the applicable law. A district court has broad discretion in formulating jury instructions, and our standard of review is whether the court abused that discretion. <em>State v. Meyer, </em>2005 MT 215, \u00b6 14, 328 Mont. 247, \u00b6 14, 119 P.3d 1214, \u00b6 14.</p>\n<p id=\"b560-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b560-8\">\u00b69 <em>Was Azure\u2019s jury venire improperly impaneled </em>?</p>\n<p id=\"b560-9\">\u00b610 Azure\u2019s jury venire was compiled by combining three separate jury panels that had been randomly selected by computer from the list of Cascade County registered voters. These panels were called for trials scheduled to occur around the same time as Azure\u2019s trial. When these other trials did not take place, the jury panels were held over and ultimately assigned to Azure\u2019s trial. Panels one and two each originally consisted of seventy persons. Panel three originally consisted of thirty-five persons. Prior to being assigned to Azure\u2019s trial, these panels were reduced to forty-six, forty-seven, and twenty-four persons respectively as a result of some jurors being excused by the clerk\u2019s office or the judge for legitimate reasons. Additionally, ten people were eliminated for failure to contact the clerk after the summons was mailed to them and the clerk was subsequently unable to reach them.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"541\">*541</page-number>\u00b611 Panel one was initially assigned to Azure\u2019s trial. However, the District Court notified the clerk several days before the trial that it wanted <em>at least </em>eighty prospective jurors in this case. To accommodate this request, the clerk\u2019s office added the twenty-four names from panel three to the forty-six names on panel one. This created a pool of seventy people. The clerk then added the first twenty-one names from panel two. However, because panel two had previously been alphabetized, the selected surnames began with the letters A through K, and the names beginning with the remaining letters of the alphabet were eliminated. Subsequently, one person from panel two was excused, leaving the District Court with ninety potential jurors from which to choose. These ninety names were placed in a box for additional random selection, and the first twenty-seven names selected comprised the venire for the jury and one alternate.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-4\">\u00b612 Azure\u2019s complaint on appeal arises from the manner in which panel two was split. He maintains that it was error to alphabetize this fist and then select only the first twenty-one persons based upon the first letter of their last names. He posits that once the list was put in alphabetical order and then not used in its entirety, it ceased to be random. He further asserts that when this list was combined with the other panels, the overall jury pool was tainted, he was denied a fair cross-section jury panel, and he is entitled to a new trial.</p>\n<p id=\"b561-5\">\u00b613 Section 3-15-503(l)(b), MCA (1995), upon which Azure relies, states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b561-6\">If the drawing of jurors is conducted by means of a computerized database, it must be conducted by use of a computerized random <em>selection process </em>that the judges of the district court of the county have approved in writing as satisfactorily fulfilling the requirements for the drawing of trial juries. [Emphasis added.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"ABz\">\u00b614  Azure complains his jury panel was not \u201crandomly\u201d selected. Using the ordinary meaning of the term \u201crandom,\u201d <em>i.e., </em>lacking a specific plan or pattern,<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> it could be argued that once the list was alphabetized, it was no longer random. However, to prevail, Azure must prove that the selection process was not random. This he has failed to do. Mere alphabetization of a randomly selected list of names and elimination of some of those names based exclusively on where they fall in the alphabet does not taint the random selection process. As a result, we conclude Azure\u2019s jury selection process did not violate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"542\">*542</page-number>\u00a7 3-15-503(l)(b), MCA (1995).</p>\n<p id=\"b562-4\">\u00b615 Without substantive analysis, Azure relies on <em>State v. Taylor </em>(1975), 168 Mont. 142, 542 P.2d 100, and <em>Taylor v. Louisiana </em>(1975), 419 U.S. 522, 95 S.Ct. 692, 45 L.Ed.2d 690, in arguing that the alphabetization and subsequent bifurcation of one jury panel \u201csystematically excluded an identifiable class of citizens.\u201d Our review of these cases leads us to share Justice Harrison\u2019s observation in <em>State v. Taylor, </em>\u201cWe have no disagreement with the case authority cited by defendant nor the law established by that authority, however, the case authority cited is not applicable to the instant case.\u201d While these cases stand for the proposition that a systematic exclusion of an <em>identifiable class of citizens </em>violates the requirement that the jury be a fair cross-section of the community, Azure failed to establish that the persons eliminated from the alphabetical list were eliminated based upon their \u201crace, color, sex, culture, social origin or condition, or political or religious ideas.\u201d <em>State v. Taylor, </em>168 Mont. at 144, 542 P.2d at 101. Moreover, Azure failed to show any prejudice against him or injury affecting his right to an impartial jury resulting from the alleged discriminatory selection of his jury. <em>State v. Taylor, </em>168 Mont. at 148, 542 P.2d at 103.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-5\">\u00b616  The elimination of panel members from a venire based exclusively on the first letter of the person\u2019s last name is not a systematic exclusion of a distinctive, identifiable class of the community. There was no discernible gender, ethnic, or other suspect grouping that occurred when certain names from panel two were used while others were not. Simply put, the twenty-six people from panel two who were not selected for Azure\u2019s jury pool do not comprise an \u201cidentifiable class of citizens,\u201d and the alphabetization of panel two and limited selection therefrom did not run afoul of the statute or applicable case law.</p>\n<p id=\"b562-6\">\u00b617  Lastly, as noted by the District Court in its Order, the jury selection process in the case before us is distinguishable from that utilized in <em>State v. LaMere, </em>2000 MT 45, 298 Mont. 358, 2 P.3d 204. In <em>LaMere, </em>the clerk notified prospective jurors of jury duty by telephone instead of through the mail. Noting that this method necessarily eliminated any person who did not have a telephone, or allowed persons with telephones to \u201cexcuse himself or herself from possible jury duty simply by failing to return the clerk\u2019s phone call,\u201d the Court held that the telephone summoning method was a \u201csubstantial failure to comply\u201d with relevant jury selection statutes, and materially undermined the purpose of these selection statutes to provide for <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"543\">*543</page-number>random selection of jurors on the basis of objective criteria. <em>LaMere, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 73 and 75. We vacated LaMere\u2019s conviction and remanded the matter for a new trial. <em>LaMere, </em>\u00b6 76. We conclude that Azure has not established that the jury summoning method employed by the clerk in this case was a \u201csubstantial failure to comply\u201d with the statutes governing the procurement of a trial jury.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-4\">\u00b618 Therefore, the District Court\u2019s decision to deny Azure\u2019s challenge to the jury venire was correct and will not be disturbed.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-5\">\u00b619 <em>Did the District Court correctly instruct the jury on the elements of criminal endangerment </em>?</p>\n<p id=\"b563-6\">\u00b620 A person commits the offense of criminal endangerment when he or she \u201cknowingly engages in conduct that creates a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury to another.\u201d Section 45-5-207(1), MCA (1995). When a criminal offense requires that a defendant act \u201cknowingly,\u201d the District Court must instruct the jury on what the term \u201cknowingly\u201d means in the context of the particular crime. The Montana Criminal Jury Instructions (MCJI) offer the following four separate definitions for \u201cknowingly:\u201d 1) when the person is aware of his or her conduct; 2) with respect to a specific circumstance defined by an offense, when the person is aware of that circumstance; 3) when the person is aware there exists the high probability that the person\u2019s conduct will cause a specific result; and 4) with respect to a specific fact, when the person is aware of a high probability of that fact\u2019s existence. We have previously said that courts may not present all four definitions to jurors and require the jurors to select the one definition it believes is most applicable. <em>See State v. Lambert </em>(1996), 280 Mont. 231, 929 P.2d 846 (Leaphart, J., concurring). Rather, the court must determine which of the four definitions is applicable to the case being heard, and instruct the jury accordingly.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-7\">\u00b621 In the case before us, the State proposed the first two definitions of \u201cknowingly\u201d cited above. Azure offered no proposed instructions on \u201cknowingly.\u201d During negotiations to settle jury instructions, however, Azure objected to the use of both definitions proposed by the State and proposed instead MC JI definitions three and four. The District Court initially decided to give instructions on definitions one through three, over Azure\u2019s counsel\u2019s continued objections. Immediately before argument, however, the District Court decided to give an instruction on MCJI definition three only. Azure\u2019s counsel agreed. Azure now complains that the District Court gave the wrong instruction and the case must be remanded.</p>\n<p id=\"b563-8\">\u00b622 Azure disingenuously implies on appeal that the District Court <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"544\">*544</page-number>gave all three definitions it originally indicated that it would. Azure submits that this \u201callowed the jury to select that definition which it believed was most applicable.\u201d The record confirms, however, that the District Court gave an instruction providing a single definition of \u201cknowingly.\u201d This complied with <em>Lambert, </em>satisfied Azure\u2019s objection, was approved by Azure\u2019s counsel, and was a proper instruction for the offense of criminal endangerment. The District Court\u2019s instruction was not an abuse of its discretion.</p>\n<p id=\"b564-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b564-5\">\u00b623 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the District Court\u2019s denial of Azure\u2019s jury challenge.</p>\n<judges id=\"b564-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES RICE, MORRIS and WARNER concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b561-7\"> The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language 1448 (4th ed. 2000).</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
