The motorcycle was driven by her uninsured fiancee. Becky, who was living with her parents at the time of her death, had an automobile insurance policy with American Economy Insurance Company (American Economy) that provided $300,000.00 uninsured motorist (UM) coverage. The Herns also carried a multi-car automobile insurance policy with Safeco, which insured four of their vehicles. The Safeco policy had a $500,000.00 UM limit per vehicle.</p>\n<p id=\"b372-18\">\u00b69 In March 1993, Ardell Hern, acting individually, as Personal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"353\">*353</page-number>Representative of the Estate of Becky Hem, and on behalf of the heirs, together with Robert Hern and Becky\u2019s sister, Lisa Hem, entered into a structured cash settlement with Safeco and American Economy valued at approximately $355,398.00.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Prior to settlement, Safeco took the position that the multi-car policy purchased by the Hems provided a maximum of $500,000.00 UM coverage. Had the Hems been able to \u201cstack\u201d the UM coverage provided for each of their four vehicles, the maximum UM coverage would have been $2,000,000.00.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-4\">\u00b610 In 1997, several Safeco and American Economy insureds, including Steven Seltzer, filed a class action suit against these and other insurance carriers. The claimants argued that Safeco charged them multiple premiums for providing UM coverage on multiple vehicles but had no intention of providing coverage beyond that afforded to a single vehicle. In other words, they maintained that Safeco had taken the same position with the class action claimants as it had with the Herns.</p>\n<p id=\"b373-5\">\u00b611 In August 2001, the parties to the class action entered into a Settlement Agreement and Stipulated Judgment <em>(Seltzer </em>Settlement or Settlement). As a result of the <em>Seltzer </em>Settlement, insureds who purchased UM coverage for multiple cars, but whose claims were negotiated under the premise that only a single UM coverage applied, were able to have their claims reopened and readjusted. The district corut defined the certified class action members as:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b373-6\">All Montana citizens who, prior to May 2, 1997, were insured by Safeco Insurance Company of Illinois [other insurers omitted] for uninsured motorist (UM) coverage and the named insured paid premiums on more than one vehicle under the same policy.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b373-7\">\u00b612 Under the terms of the Settlement, the insurers were required to identify and notify the class members. The notification informed them that \u201c</p>\n<blockquote id=\"AaE\">if a class member was injured in an accident involving an uninsured motorist, and it is believed that the damages are in excess of the policy\u2019s UM limits for a single vehicle, and, further, if the class member wishes to have the claim reexamined,\u201d he or she could obtain a proof of claim form, complete it and submit it to the insurer. If the claim was submitted within the time required, the insurers, including Safeco, were required <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"354\">*354</page-number>to reopen the claim and readjust it on the premise that the multiple UM coverages were capable of being stacked. If the claimant was subsequently dissatisfied with the readjustment, he or she could pursue legal action against the insurer.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b374-4\">\u00b613 Upon receipt of their notice of class member status, the Herns completed the necessary paperwork and submitted a claim for readjustment. Safeco denied the claim, presumably on the basis that the value of the Herns\u2019 claim was below the one policy limit of $500,000.00. After the Herns were notified that Safeco had denied their claim, and in accordance with the <em>Seltzer </em>Settlement terms, the Hems filed the instant action against Safeco, seeking full recovery of their damages.</p>\n<p id=\"b374-5\">\u00b614 The Herns filed a combined Motion for Summary Judgment and Motion to Strike Affirmative Defenses in the District Court. The Hems sought to preclude Safeco from asserting the defenses of \u201cstatute of limitations,\u201d \u201caccord and satisfaction,\u201d and \u201cpayment and release\u201d-affirmative defenses Safeco had preserved for future use, should they be appropriate, by declaring them in its Answer to the Herns\u2019 Complaint. Safeco had also included \u201cestoppel,\u201d <em>\u201cres judicata,\u201d </em>and \u201cwaiver\u201d in its preserved list of defenses. Safeco subsequently filed a Cross-Motion for Summary Judgement seeking an Order that the Herns were barred from relitigating the wrongful death/survivorship action. The parties agreed that there were no genuine issues of material fact relevant to these motions, and that they were amenable to summary judgment. The District Court granted the Hems\u2019 Motion, allowing their litigation to go forward, and denied Safeco\u2019s Motion.</p>\n<p id=\"Aq9\">\u00b615 A jury trial was held from June 14-16,2004. The jury determined that the Hems\u2019 damages totaled $3,810,034.10. Using a Special Verdict form that had been tendered by the Herns, the jury apportioned the damages as follows:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-6\">Damages for the Estate of Becky Hern</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-7\">1. Loss of earning capacity of Becky Hern $ 883,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AJL\">2. Pain and suffering experienced by Becky Hern 35,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AkO\">3. Value of household services performed by Becky Hern 140,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A7E\">4. Loss of established course of life for Becky Hern $1,500,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b374-11\">Wrongful Death and Emotional Distress Damages for [Robert] and Ardell Hern</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b375-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"355\">*355</page-number>1. Loss of society, comfort care, and companionship</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AeW\">[Robert] $ 200,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AFI\">Ardell 300,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"Aie\">2. Grief, sorrow and mental anguish</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"ANp\">[Robert] 300,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AN7\">Ardell 450,000.00</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"AGX\">3. Funeral and Burial Expenses 2,034.10</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"A8C\">Total $3,810,034.10</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b375-10\">\u00b616 After the jury returned its verdict, which exceeded $3.8 million, the District Court entered its judgment, reducing the award to $2 million, representing the amount of money available under the four stacked policies. Subsequently, on July 28, 2004, the District Court entered an Amended Judgment. In the Amended Judgment, the District Court expressly acknowledged that Safeco had already paid the Herns $156,250.00 in UM benefits. The court therefore subtracted that amount from the $2,000,000 owed by Safeco thereby reducing the Herns\u2019 recovery to $1,843,750.00. The District Court also noted that the <em>Seltzer </em>Settlement imposed an obligation on Safeco to pay interest at 10% per year on a claim from the date it was originally adjusted and closed to the date of payment of the reopened claim. The court calculated that such interest on the Herns\u2019 claim from February 1993 to June 16, 2004, was $2,085,710.62. The District Court added this interest calculation plus the $1,406.71 stipulated costs of the Herns\u2019 lawsuit to the balance of the UM benefits owed to the Hems. The court then ordered Safeco to pay the total amount of $3,930,867.33.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-11\">\u00b617 Safeco appeals the District Court\u2019s denial of its Motion for Summary Judgment, the use of the special verdict form and the instructions to the jury regarding the type of damages to be awarded, and the court\u2019s imposition of prejudgment interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b375-12\">STANDARDS OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b375-13\">\u00b618 Our standard of review of appeals from summary judgment is <em>de novo. </em>We apply the same criteria applied by the district court pursuant to Rule 56(c), M.R.Civ.P. The moving party must establish both the absence of genuine issues of material fact and entitlement to judgment as a matter of law. Once the moving party has met its burden, the opposing party must present material and substantial evidence, rather than mere conclusory or speculative statements, to raise a genuine issue of material fact. We review a district court\u2019s conclusions of law to determine whether the court\u2019s conclusions of law are correct. <em>Hanson v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"356\">*356</page-number><em>Water Ski Mania Estates, </em>2005 MT 47, \u00b6 11, 326 Mont. 154, \u00b6 11, 108 P.3d 481, \u00b6 11 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-4\">\u00b619  A district court has discretion regarding the instructions it gives or refuses to give to a jury and we will not reverse a district court on the basis of its instructions absent an abuse of discretion. In reviewing whether a particular jury instruction was properly given or refused, we consider the instruction in its entirety, as well as in connection with the other instructions given and with the evidence introduced at trial. The party assigning error to a district court\u2019s instruction must show prejudice in order to prevail, and prejudice will not be found if the jury instructions in their entirety state the applicable law of the case. <em>Kiely Const., L.L.C. v. City of Red Lodge, </em>2002 MT 241, \u00b6 62, 312 Mont. 52, \u00b6 62, 57 P.3d 836, \u00b6 62 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-5\">\u00b620 We also review the trial court\u2019s usage of a special verdict form for an abuse of discretion. \u201c[0]ur ordinary standard of review of a discretionary trial court ruling, including the use of a special verdict form, is whether the court abused its discretion.\u201d Ele <em>v. Ehnes, </em>2003 MT 131, \u00b6 18, 316 Mont. 69, \u00b6 18, 68 P.3d 835, \u00b6 18 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b376-6\">\u00b621 Lastly, a district court\u2019s award of prejudgment interest is a question of law which we examine for correctness. <em>Semenza v. Bowman </em>(1994), 268 Mont. 118, 127, 885 P.2d 451, 456.</p>\n<p id=\"b376-7\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b376-8\">\u00b622 <em>1. Did the District Court err in granting the Herns\u2019 combined Motion for Summary Judgment and Motion to Strike Affirmative Defenses and in denying Safeco\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b376-9\">\u00b623 Safeco asserts that \u201c[t]he first and most critical string of errors committed by the district court was its decision to grant the Hems\u2019 motion to strike SAFECO\u2019s affirmative defenses of estoppel and <em>res judicata </em>and to deny SAFECO\u2019s motion for summary judgment.\u201d Safeco argues that the District Court\u2019s decision to grant the Hems\u2019 Motion to Strike led it to erroneously deny Safeco\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment and grant the Herns\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment. Safeco further maintains that the <em>Seltzer </em>Settlement expressly allowed Safeco \u201cthe right to assert all applicable defenses,\u201d and that the District Court \u201csimply ignored the plain language of the <em>Seltzer </em>agreement.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b376-10\">\u00b624 The District Court\u2019s Order granting the Herns\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment and Motion to Strike Affirmative Defenses did not expressly address the Herns\u2019 request that certain affirmative defenses be struck. The Order concentrated instead on the factors supporting the Herns\u2019 right to summary judgment. The court noted that the <em>Seltzer </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"357\">*357</page-number>Settlement clearly allowed members of the certified class to reopen their claims. The District Court further observed that Safeco conceded that the Herns were class members. Addressing Safeco\u2019s argument that the Herns were \u201cnot injured,\u201d the court disagreed, explaining that Safeco\u2019s narrow definition of \u201cinjury\u201d to mean \u201cbodily injury\u201d only, was not in keeping with the legal definition of \u201cinjuiy\u201d used in the law of damages. The court reasoned that the legal definition of \u201cinjury\u201d encompasses physical injury as well as \u201cany wrong or damage done to another, either in his person, rights, reputation or property.\u201d The court further noted that \u00a7\u00a7 27-1-501, -512, and -513, MCA, recognize a right of a decedent\u2019s heirs to recover damages for the wrongful death of their child, including grief and sorrow. The court concluded, therefore, that the Hems were class members who were injured, thus entitling them to relitigate their wrongful death claims. On this basis, the District Court granted the Herns\u2019 combined Motion for Summary Judgment and Motion to Strike Affirmative Defenses, and denied Safeco\u2019s Cross-Motion.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-4\">\u00b625 As indicated above, summary judgment is proper only when no genuine issue of material fact exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Rule 56(c), M.R.Civ.P. The first prong of this test has been met-the parties and the District Court correctly concluded that no genuine issues of material fact relevant to these motions existed.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-5\">\u00b626 We also conclude that the District Court\u2019s legal analysis and conclusion were correct. Safeco conceded that the Hems were members of the class. Also, as the District Court correctly determined, the Herns were \u201cinjured.\u201d As a result of being \u201cinjured class members,\u201d under the express terms of the <em>Seltzer </em>Settlement they were entitled by law to have their claims reopened, and litigate in the event they were dissatisfied with Safeco\u2019s readjustment after reopening.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-6\">\u00b627 As to the affirmative defenses, we note that the Order, without explanation, granted the Herns\u2019 request to strike the defenses of \u201cstatute of limitations,\u201d \u201caccord and satisfaction,\u201d and \u201cpayment and release.\u201d No reference was made, however, to Safeco\u2019s affirmative defenses of estoppel and <em>res </em>judicata; thus, those defenses were not actually struck from Safeco\u2019s Answer.</p>\n<p id=\"b377-7\">\u00b628 It is also noteworthy that Safeco did not raise these defenses either in response to Herns\u2019 Motion for Summary Judgment or in support of its own cross-motion; therefore, the defenses were waived for purposes of summary judgment. This omission both justifies the District Court\u2019s actions, and makes sense. In light of the provisions of the <em>Seltzer </em>Agreement, which expressly allowed previously settled claims to be <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"358\">*358</page-number>reopened and relitigated, the defenses of estoppel and <em>res judicata </em>simply have no application.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-4\">\u00b629  Based on the foregoing, and because the District Court\u2019s rationale in granting summary judgment to the Herns was correct, we conclude the District Court did not err in denying summary judgment to Safeco or in granting summary judgment to the Herns.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-5\">\u00b630 <em>2. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by instructing the jury to award compensation to the estate of Becky Hern for the value of household services performed by Becky and for the loss of Becky\u2019s ability to pursue an established course of life?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b378-6\">\u00b631 Safeco argues that the District Court abused its discretion by giving a jury instruction that permitted the jury to award damages to the estate of Becky Hern for: 1) the loss of Becky Hern\u2019s ability to pursue an established course of life after the date of death and throughout the remainder of her life expectancy, and 2) the loss of Becky Hern\u2019s capacity to perform personal and household services after the date of death during the remainder of her life expectancy. Safeco asserts that Montana law does not allow these damages in a survival action because they are not damages suffered by Becky Hern. Safeco maintains that the court erroneously combined the elements of damage available in personal injury and wrongful death actions with those available in a survival action.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-7\">\u00b632 The Herns counter that damages recoverable in a survivorship action are identical to those available in a personal injury action and therefore it was not an abuse of the court\u2019s discretion to instruct the jury accordingly. They further note that they did not seek economic compensation for these particular losses in their wrongful death action, so there was no duplication of compensation.</p>\n<p id=\"b378-8\">\u00b633 We begin our analysis by briefly distinguishing the causes of action available in Montana to the survivors of a decedent whose death is caused by the negligence of another-i.e., survival and wrongful death. (For a detailed analysis of these causes of action, see <em>Swanson v. Champion Intern. Corp. </em>(1982), 197 Mont. 509, 646 P.2d 1166, and <em>Payne v. Eighth Judicial Dist. Court, </em>2002 MT 313, 313 Mont. 118, 60 P.3d 469.)</p>\n<p id=\"b378-9\">\u00b634 A \u201csurvival\u201d action arises from \u00a7 27-1-501, MCA, which states in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b378-10\">An action, cause of action, ... does not abate because of the death or disability of a party ... but whenever the cause of action or defense arose in favor of such party prior to his death or disability ..., it survives and may be maintained by his representatives or successors in interest.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b379-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"359\">*359</page-number>\u00b635  A survival action raises claims that came into existence while the decedent was still alive. These claims survive his or her death, and the cause may be pursued against the responsible party by the decedent\u2019s personal representative. Section 72-3-604, MCA. The damages that may be recovered in a survival action include lost earnings from the time of injury to death, the present value of reasonable earnings during the decedent\u2019s remaining life expectancy, medical and funeral expenses, reasonable compensation for pain and suffering, and other special damages. <em>Swanson, </em>197 Mont. at 515, 646 P.2d at 1169 (citations omitted). The source of the damages recoverable in the survival action are personal to the decedent and do not include damages suffered by the decedent\u2019s spouse, children or other heirs. <em>Swanson, </em>197 Mont. at 515, 646 P.2d at 1169 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b379-4\">\u00b636  Section 27-1513, MCA, creates a cause of action for wrongful death. Damages for wrongful death are non-specific and \u00a7 27-1-323, MCA, provides that \u201cdamages may be given as under all the circumstances of the case may be just.\u201d Generally, damages under a wrongful death claim will include loss of consortium by a spouse, loss of comfort and society of the decedent suffered by the surviving heirs, and the reasonable value of the contributions in money that the decedent would reasonably have made for the support, education, training and care of the heirs had she lived. <em>Swanson, </em>197 Mont. at 517, 646 P.2d at 1170 (citations omitted). Otherwise stated, survival damages are personal to the decedent but are pursued by her personal representative, while wrongful death damages are personal to those who survive her.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-5\">\u00b637 Safeco alleges the jury was wrongly instructed on these damages. First, Safeco asserts that the jury instruction used by the District Court to permit a damage award to Becky\u2019s estate for Becky\u2019s lost ability to pursue an established course of life, Montana Pattern Jury Instruction (MPI) 25.07, is specifically a \u201cpersonal injury\u201d instruction addressing a \u201cplaintiff\u201d who has been permanently injured, as opposed to a \u201cdecedent.\u201d Safeco maintains that this instruction is inappropriate to a survivor claim.</p>\n<p id=\"b379-6\">\u00b638  Analysis of relevant case law reveals that \u201closs of established course of life\u201d damages are unique to Montana, and that in all reported cases-which include dozens of Montana state and federal court cases-these damages have been confined to personal injury as opposed to survivor claims. <em>See, e.g., Henricksen v. State, </em>2004 MT 20, \u00b6 76, 319 Mont. 307, \u00b6 76, 84 P.3d 38, \u00b6 76 (A plaintiff is \u201centitled to recover, in the case of permanent injuries, a reasonable compensation for the destruction of his capacity to pursue an established course of life.\u201d) <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"360\">*360</page-number>(citation omitted); <em>Callihan v. Burlington Northern Inc. </em>(1982), 201 Mont. 350, 358, 654 P.2d 972, 977 (\u201cThe record shows plaintiffs life largely consists of experiencing intractable pain. Plaintiff cannot participate in the outdoor activities which he loved. He can no longer be an active, productive member of his family. Nor is he able to enjoy a physical relationship with his wife.\u201d). <em>See also Magart v. Schank, </em>2000 MT 279, 302 Mont. 151, 13 P.3d 390; <em>Anderson v. Werner Enterprisess., Inc., </em>1998 MT 333, 292 Mont. 284, 972 P.2d 806.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-4\">\u00b639 The rationale for limiting this species of damages to personal injury claims was succinctly expressed in <em>Oberson v. U.S. </em>(D. Mont. 2004), 311 F.Supp.2d 917, 961, \u201cWhen the plaintiff has been permanently injured and where he will continue to suffer in the future from his injuries, reasonable compensation for the loss of an established course of life is a proper element of damage.\u201d In other words, loss of established course of life damages are intended to compensate for an injured person\u2019s loss of what she once had, and the accompanying realization that she will live the rest of her life without ever recovering her previous course of life. We therefore agree with Safeco, and conclude that damages of loss of established course of living are not recoverable in survivor actions. Therefore, we conclude the District Court incorrectly instructed the jury that it could award loss of established course of life damages in this survivor action.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-5\">\u00b640 Additionally, Safeco asserts that compensation for lost household services is a legitimate damage available in a personal injury claim under MPI 25.04, or a wrongful death action under MPI 25.20, but it is not appropriate for a survivor action. Technically, Safeco is correct. Nonetheless, we conclude for the reason set forth below that it was not an abuse of the District Court\u2019s discretion to include such a damage instruction in the survivor action.</p>\n<p id=\"b380-6\">\u00b641  In 1987, the Legislature amended \u00a7 27-1-501, MCA, to require that \u201cactions brought under this section and 27-1-513 must be combined in one legal action, and any element of damages may be recovered only once.\u201d The primary purpose of this change was to prohibit double recovery in wrongful death and survivor actions. <em>Payne, </em>\u00b6 14. In the case before us, it is significant that the Herns, though entitled, did not seek to recover the value of household services performed by Becky as part of their wrongful death claim. As a result, there was no impermissible double recovery of these damages. Moreover, the damages awarded to the Herns are within the range of damages to which they were entitled. We conclude that the inclusion of the value of household services in the survivor action rather than the wrongful death action, while technically erroneous, does not constitute an abuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"361\">*361</page-number>of discretion under these circumstances. We caution, however, that in the future, damages available in wrongful death actions should be included in the wrongful death portion of the verdict form.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-4\">\u00b642 <em>3. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by instructing the jury on loss of consortium damages ?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b381-5\">\u00b643 The parties disagree as to which damage awards constitute the \u201closs of consortium\u201d award. Safeco asserts that the jury\u2019s award of $750,000.00, ($300,000.00 to Robert and $450,000.00 to Ardell) designated on the verdict form as \u201cgrief, sorrow and mental anguish,\u201d constituted an erroneous \u201closs of consortium\u201d award. The Herns argue that the $200,000.00 awarded to Robert and the $300,000.00 awarded to Ardell for \u201closs of society, comfort care, and companionship\u201d represented the \u201closs of consortium\u201d damages, and were correctly awarded.</p>\n<p id=\"b381-6\">\u00b644  Filial \u201cconsortium\u201d is defined in <em>Black\u2019s Law Dictionary </em>304 (7th ed. 1999), as \u201ca child\u2019s society, affection, and companionship given to a parent.\u201d Moreover, our cases have repeatedly utilized these same terms when describing loss of consortium damages. In <em>Pence v. Fox </em>(1991), 248 Mont. 521, 526, 813 P.2d 429, 432, we explained,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b381-7\">While the term \u201closs of consortium\u201d has been attached to the children\u2019s claim, the broader term, \u201closs of society and companionship,\u201d is equally appropriate. Use of the latter term avoids the narrower construction connoting this right derives primarily from the sexual relationship incident to marriage. While companionship may include sexual relations [See, <em>e.g. </em>Prosser, Torts \u00a7 125 at 889 (4th Ed. 1971) as cited in CJI-Civ.2d 6:7 (1980)], courts have continued to regard loss of consortium to embrace all of those values-tangible and intangible \u2014 inherent in the family relationship. In his treatise, [H. Clark, <em>Domestic Relations </em>\u00a7 10.1 (1968)], Clark asserts that the term loss of consortium is equally appropriate in reference to the parent-child relationship to summarize \u201cthe multitude of rights and duties binding parents to their children and vice versa.\u201d <em>Clark </em>at \u00a7 10.1.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b381-8\"><em>See also, Gunning v. General Motors Corp. </em>(1989), 239 Mont. 104, 107, 779 P.2d 64, 66 (\u201cConsortium includes a legal right to the aid, protection, affection and society....\u201d); <em>Bain v. Gleason </em>(1986), 223 Mont. 442, 445, 726 P.2d 1153, 1155 (\u2018We further agree with the court in Dutton,... that consortium includes a legal right to the ... affection and society of the other spouse.\u201d). We therefore conclude that the $200,000.00 damages awarded to Robert and the $300,000.00 awarded to Ardell for \u201closs of society, comfort care, and companionship\u201d constitute the \u201closs of consortium\u201d damages awarded in this case.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"362\">*362</page-number>\u00b645 Safeco maintains that Montana law does not recognize a parent\u2019s claim for loss of consortium for the death of an adult child. Furthermore, Safeco argues that Robert Hern, who was not Becky\u2019s personal representative, could not in any event lawfully assert a loss of consortium claim or a \u201cgrief, sorrow and mental anguish\u201d claim, as only the personal representative may pursue such wrongful death damages.</p>\n<p id=\"AYu\">\u00b646 As indicated above, under \u00a7 27-1-513, MCA, the personal representative of the decedent\u2019s estate is authorized to bring an action for wrongful death. This statute and its predecessor have been interpreted to mean that <em>only one </em>wrongful death action arising out of a wrongful death may be brought and the decedent\u2019s personal representative is the only person who may bring such an action. The personal representative holds the proceeds of any damage award for the heirs of the decedent and the award does not become part of the decedent\u2019s estate. <em>Renville v. Frederickson, </em>2004 MT 324, 324 Mont. 86, 101 P.3d 773.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-4\">\u00b647  In the case before us, Robert was not the personal representative of Becky\u2019s estate and, therefore, it was error for the District Court to instruct the jury that it could award damages of any kind to Robert personally, in the wrongful death claim. Therefore, we vacate the $500,000.00 awarded to Robert as part of the wrongful death claim, $300,000.00 of which was for grief, sorrow, and mental anguish, and $200,000.00 for loss of consortium.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-5\">\u00b648 We next review the damages awarded to Ardell as Becky\u2019s personal representative. As indicated above, the jury awarded $300,000.00 to Ardell for \u201closs of society, comfort care, and companionship,\u201d and $450,000.00 for \u201cgrief, sorrow, and mental anguish.\u201d The Herns maintain that a claim for loss of consortium of an adult child in the context of a wrongful death action is compensable under Montana statute, applicable case law, and for sound public policy reasons. Therefore, we turn to an analysis of the $300,000.00 loss of consortium award to Ardell.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-6\">\u00b649 Ardell maintains that \u00a7 27-1-323, MCA, recognizes a broad range of damages \u201cas under all the circumstances of the case may be just.\u201d Moreover, she urges us to adopt the rationale of the U.S. District Court in Montana (hereinafter the \u201cfederal court\u201d) in <em>Bear Medicine v. U.S., </em>(D. Mont. 2002) 192 F.Supp.2d 1053.</p>\n<p id=\"b382-7\">\u00b650 In <em>Bear Medicine, </em>the thirty-three year old son of George and Molly Kicking Woman, Leland Kicking Woman, was seriously injured at a logging site on the Blackfeet Reservation. Leland, who was at the site seeking a job, was getting a tour of the site by his friend, Malcolm New Robe. While the two men were watching another employee fell a tree, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"363\">*363</page-number>the tree being cut fell in an unintended direction. Leland saw the tree falling in his and Malcolm\u2019s direction but realized that Malcolm did not see it. Leland quickly pushed Malcolm to safety and the tree struck Leland, rendering him a quadriplegic. Approximately nine months later, Leland died from complications associated with his injuries. <em>Bear Medicine, </em>192 F.Supp.2d at 1058-60.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-4\">\u00b651 Leland was survived by his parents, his sister, his wife, and six children. In addition to other damages awarded to his wife and children, the federal court allowed Leland\u2019s parents to recover for loss of consortium. The federal court speculated, as well, that the Montana Supreme Court would adopt a cause of action for parents of adult children. <em>Bear Medicine, </em>192 F.Supp.2d at 1059-60 and 1067-69.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-5\">\u00b652 To understand the federal court\u2019s ruling, it is important to understand Leland\u2019s relationship with his parents. Leland\u2019s father is a bundle holder in the Blackfeet Tribe and is entrusted with important duties in their traditional culture. George had been tutoring Leland to perform various sacred rituals on behalf of the Tribe. Leland had been undergoing training for at least fifteen years to be a spiritual leader and holder of the \u201cThunder Pipe Bundle.\u201d The federal court explained that the Thunder Pipe is probably 400 years old and had come down through Molly\u2019s family, with George being the holder for fifty-three years. Leland had been groomed to replace his father in this very important cultural role since his early teens. Leland\u2019s death was a serious loss to his parents, his family and his Tribe. <em>Bear Medicine, </em>192 F.Supp.2d at 1062-63.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-6\">\u00b653 Moreover, Leland was a devoted son who ran his parents\u2019 ranch and lease holdings. In addition to being an active participating father of his six children, Leland spent many hours with his elderly parents offering comfort, care, counsel and companionship. His strong relationship with his parents reinforced the cultural ties that bind the generations of Blackfeet. Because of his unique personality, disciplined life style and deep cultural connections, his parents chose him to carry on the family\u2019s tradition of tribal and spiritual leadership. Both George and Molly underwent psychological counseling to help them deal with their grief and the tragic loss of their son. <em>Bear Medicine, </em>192 F.Supp.2d at 1064-65.</p>\n<p id=\"b383-7\">\u00b654 The federal court explained its rationale for expanding recovery to the parents of an adult child by stating:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b383-8\">The Montana Supreme Court has \u201crecognized repeatedly [its] authority and responsibility for the continued development of the common law\u201d in this area. Montana allows loss of consortium claims by a husband or wife whose spouse has been killed or <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"364\">*364</page-number>injured. Montana also allows loss of consortium claims by a minor child or a parent whose minor child or parent has been killed or injured. Allowing a loss of consortium claim for parents of adult children only furthers this development of the common law and is consistent with the purposes of the law recognized by the legislature of the State of Montana as interpreted by the Montana Supreme Court.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b384-4\"><em>Bear Medicine, </em>192 F.Supp.2d at 1067 (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b384-5\">\u00b655 In addition to the federal court\u2019s reliance on Montana policy in this area, it also relied <em>on Howard Frank, M.D., P.C. v. Superior Court </em>(Ariz. 1986), 722 P.2d 955. In <em>Frank, </em>the Arizona court reasoned that parents should be able to recover for the loss of consortium of an adult child because the grief and sorrow of losing a child does not end when that child turns eighteen. The federal court noted that we have previously followed the rationale of the Arizona Supreme Court in another important loss of parental consortium claim. <em>See Keele v. St. Vincent Hosp. &amp; Health Care </em>(1993), 258 Mont. 158, 162, 852 P.2d 574, 577, wherein we cited <em>Villareal v. State, Dept. of Transp. </em>(Ariz. 1989), 774 P.2d 213. <em>Bear Medicine, </em>192 F.Supp.2d at 1067.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-6\">\u00b656 In <em>Keele, </em>relying on <em>Pence, </em>the district court dismissed a minor\u2019s claim for loss of parental consortium because the parent who suffered the tortious injury was not rendered a quadriplegic. We concluded that the court\u2019s interpretation of <em>Pence </em>requiring quadriplegia was too narrow. We therefore crafted a new standard to be applied to loss of parental consortium claims and relied heavily on <em>Villareal\u2019s </em>rationale.</p>\n<p id=\"Ak-\">\u00b657 Lastly, the federal court recognized that \u201c[t]he loss of [the parent-child] relationship, not the arbitrary age of the individuals involved, determines whether a loss of consortium claim is appropriate. Once viewed in this manner, it is proof of the quality of the relationship that should logically govern the extent of any claim by a parent concerning their damages incurred by the death of their adult child.\u201d <em>Bear Medicine, </em>192 F.Supp.2d at 1067-68.</p>\n<p id=\"b384-7\">\u00b658  We conclude that under certain circumstances such as those evidenced by the relationship between Leland Kicking Woman and his parents, the bond between parents and an adult child, and the loss experienced by the parents at the death of or serious injury to their child, may be of such quality as to warrant recovery by the parents for loss of consortium. Having said this, we cannot craft a hard and fast set of facts or rule that will define exactly under what circumstances a loss of consortium claim by parents of an adult child will stand. Rather, each case must be determined on the facts and evidence presented. We conclude, however, that significant evidence of an extraordinarily close <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"365\">*365</page-number>and interdependent relationship must be presented before a court may consider awarding loss of consortium damages to the parents of an adult child.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-4\">\u00b659 Typically, it would be the province of the district court to determine whether evidence of such a quality parent-child relationship could be found; if insufficient evidence existed, the district court could so determine as a matter of law. If sufficient evidence of such a quality relationship existed in the court\u2019s view, it would then be the jury\u2019s responsibility to determine whether such a relationship actually existed and, if so, whether it warranted recovery under a loss of consortium claim. However, given the record here, we conclude that remand for further proceedings is unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-5\">\u00b660 Prior to trial, the parties submitted to the District Court briefs on the issue of whether Becky\u2019s parents could recover damages for the loss of consortium of their adult daughter. Herns argued entitlement to such damages on the basis of <em>Bear Medicine, </em>and Safeco likewise addressed the applicability of the case. At trial, Herns presented to the jury that evidence which they had claimed in their briefs entitled them to consortium damages under <em>Bear Medicine. </em>While the District Court never formally held that <em>Bear Medicine </em>was the standard, nonetheless <em>after </em>being briefed on the <em>Bear Medicine </em>standard, it instructed the jury that it could award consortium damages to the parents. Thus, the District Court had before it at trial the same evidence and law it would be called upon to consider in the event we were to remand this issue for farther consideration. We therefore conclude that remand is unnecessary.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-6\">\u00b661 Upon reviewing the evidence of the relationship between Becky and her parents, we conclude as a matter of law that the <em>Bear Medicine </em>standard has not been met. While we sympathize with the Hems for the loss of their daughter, we reiterate that a high level of proof must be met before such damages may be awarded. We note specifically that Becky did not contribute to the financial support of her parents, nor did she manage their property or holdings. Moreover, a critical factor in the federal court\u2019s ruling in <em>Bear Medicine </em>was the unique role Leland performed to the family\u2019s tradition of tribal and spiritual leadership. No similar factor is evident in the case before us. Therefore, we conclude that the award of $300,000.00 for loss of consortium damages to Ardell must be vacated.</p>\n<p id=\"b385-7\">\u00b662  However, we affirm the jury\u2019s award of $450,000.00 to Ardell for grief, sorrow, and mental anguish. It is well established that a jury may award \u201creasonable compensation for grief, sorrow and mental anguish\u201d in wrongful death actions. <em>See Busta v. Columbus Hosp. Corp. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"366\">*366</page-number>(1996), 276 Mont. 342, 916 P.2d 122; <em>Estate of Spicher v. Miller </em>(1993), 260 Mont. 504, 861 P.2d 183; <em>Dawson v. Hill &amp; Hill Truck Lines </em>(1983), 206 Mont. 325, 671 P.2d 589. <em>See also </em>MPI 25.22 (\u201creasonable compensation for grief, suffering and mental anguish\u201d may be awarded in wrongful death actions). As personal representative of Becky\u2019s estate, Ardell was entitled to pursue such damages on behalf of herself and Becky\u2019s heirs. We therefore decline to disturb this award.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-4\">\u00b663 <em>4. Did the District Court abuse its discretion by permitting the jury to apportion damages under a \u201cspecial verdict\u201d form?</em></p>\n<p id=\"b386-5\">\u00b664 Safeco argues on appeal that the special verdict form used by the District Court allowed the jury to award damages separately to Robert and Ardell Hem for: 1) the loss of society, comfort, care and companionship of their daughter, and 2) grief, sorrow, and mental anguish. Safeco maintains that this \u201cfour times apportionment\u201d amongst the heirs runs directly counter to this Court\u2019s previous pronouncement in <em>Swanson </em>that damages in a wrongful death action must be returned by \u201cgeneral\u201d verdict. It maintains that the use of special verdict forms can cause confusion and duplication of damage awards.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-6\">\u00b665 Having reversed the jury\u2019s awards to Robert under the wrongful death claim, and having reversed the loss of consortium award to Ardell, we have removed the obj ectionable entries of the special verdict. Therefore, we need not address this issue further.</p>\n<p id=\"b386-7\">\u00b666 <em>5. Did the District Court err in awarding the Herns damages in excess of the $2,000,000.00 policy limit through the addition of interest?</em></p>\n<p id=\"AHU\">\u00b667 Safeco maintains on appeal that it was error for the court to award interest on the Herns\u2019 verdict, because the award pushed Herns\u2019 recovery over the $2,000,000.00 policy limit. Our review of the record reveals that Safeco did not present this argument to the District Court. When Safeco filed its Response to Herns\u2019 Motion to Amend Judgment, Safeco argued that under the <em>Seltzer </em>Settlement only class members who <em>settled </em>their claims under the class action, as opposed to litigating them, were entitled to interest. The District Court rejected this argument and amended the judgment to include prejudgment interest. Safeco now argues-for the first time on appeal-that its maximum liability for damages, plus interest, cannot exceed the policy limits. This is an entirely new theory, and as such, we decline to address it. As we have held on many occasions, \u201cthis Court will not consider new issues or changes in legal theory on appeal.\u201d <em>State v. Yecovenko, </em>2004 MT 196, \u00b6 22, 322 Mont. 247, \u00b6 22, 95 P.3d 145, \u00b6 22 (citations omitted). Therefore, we decline to disturb the District Court\u2019s award of interest.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"367\">*367</page-number>CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b387-4\">\u00b668 For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the District Court on the following issues: 1) its grant of summary judgment to the Herns; 2) its instruction on \u201clost household services\u201d; 3) its award of damages to Ardell as personal representative for grief, sorrow, and mental anguish, and 4) its award of prejudgment interest. We vacate: 1) the $1.5 million award to Becky\u2019s estate for \u201closs of established course of life,\u201d 2) Robert\u2019s $500,000.00 in wrongful death damages, and 3) Ardell\u2019s $300,000.00 loss of consortium award. These vacated damages totaling $2,300,000.00 \u2014 deducted from the jury award of $3,810,034.10 \u2014 leave damages to the estate and Ardell in the net amount of $1,510,034.10.</p>\n<p id=\"AtE\">\u00b669 Unlike the situation before the District Court in post-judgment proceedings, the net damages are within the $2,000,000.00 aggregate damages available -under the Safeco policies pursuant to the <em>Seltzer </em>Settlement. It is then appropriate to subtract from the net damages, as the District Court properly did, the $156,250.00 representing the amount of UM benefits paid by Safeco to the Hems as part of the original proceeding, resulting in total damages to the Hems of $1,353,784.10. We therefore remand to the District Court for a calculation of prejudgment interest on $1,353,784.10, and order Safeco to pay to the Herns the principal and interest due them hereunder.</p>\n<p id=\"Ad6\">\u00b670 Affirmed in part and reversed and remanded in part.</p>\n<judges id=\"b387-5\">JUSTICES NELSON, LEAPHART and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b373-8\"> At the time of settlement, American Economy paid $93,750.00 to the Hems, and Safeco paid $21,648.00.

We are not constrained to fulfill the Federal District Court\u2019s prediction. <em>See Maney v. Louisiana Pacific Corp., </em>2000 MT 366, \u00b6 26, 303 Mont. 398, \u00b6 26, 15 P.3d 962, \u00b6 26 (citations omitted). I would not do so in the present case.</p>\n<p id=\"b387-8\">\u00b673 I do agree with Chief Judge Molloy\u2019s observation in <em>Bear Medicine, </em>192 F.Supp.2d at 1067, that this Court has \u201crecognized repeatedly [our] authority and responsibility for the continued development of the common law.\u201d In that regard, I take this opportunity to briefly review the development of Montana law concerning claims arising out of the parent-child relationship.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"368\">*368</page-number>\u00b674 In <em>Dawson v. Hill &amp; Hill Truck Lines </em>(1983), 206 Mont. 325, 671 P.2d 589, we answered a certified question asking whether damages for sorrow, mental distress or grief of the parents of a deceased minor were recoverable in a wrongful death action brought pursuant to \u00a7 27-1-512, MCA (1979). Two statutes were at issue. Section 27-1-512, MCA (1979), allowed a parent or guardian to bring an action for injury to-or the wrongful death of-a minor child or ward. Section 27-1-323, MCA (1979), provided: \u201c[i]n every action under 27-1-512 and 27-1-513, such damages may be given as under all the circumstances of the case may be just.\u201d We determined that parents may recover for sorrow, mental distress or grief resulting from the death of a minor child in a wrongful death action pursuant to \u00a7 27-1-512, MCA (1979). <em>Dawson, </em>206 Mont. at 332-33, 671 P.2d at 593-94.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-4\">\u00b675 In <em>Pence v. Fox </em>(1991), 248 Mont. 521, 813 P.2d 429, we were asked whether a minor child has a separate cause of action for loss of parental consortium when a parent is tortiously injured and rendered quadriplegic. In responding, we traced the history of consortium claims back to ancient Roman civil law, under which only a husband could bring a claim for loss of consortium. We observed that the law finally recognized a wife\u2019s right to bring consortium claims for loss caused by negligence in 1950. <em>Pence, </em>248 Mont. at 523, 813 P.2d at 430-31 (citations omitted). We also noted that minor children have been able to bring consortium claims for the death of a parent since 1983. <em>Pence, </em>248 Mont. at 524, 813 P.2d at 431 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p id=\"b388-5\">\u00b676 In discussing whether to broaden a child\u2019s consortium claim to encompass a parent tortiously injured and rendered quadriplegic, we focused on a minor child\u2019s legal rights to the support, aid, protection, affection, society, discipline, guidance and training of their parents. <em>Pence, </em>248 Mont. at 526-27, 813 P.2d at 432-33. On that basis, we held that minor children who have been deprived of those rights have a separate cause of action for loss of consortium when a parent is tortiously injured and rendered a quadriplegic. <em>Pence, </em>248 Mont. at 527, 813 P.2d at 433.</p>\n<p id=\"b388-6\">\u00b677 Finally, two years later in <em>Keele v. St. Vincent Hosp. </em>(1993), 258 Mont. 158, 852 P.2d 574, which I was proud to author for the Court, we expanded <em>Pence </em>under our authority and responsibility for the continued development of the common law. <em>Keele, </em>258 Mont. at 161, 852 P.2d at 576. We saw no rational basis for limiting loss of parental consortium claims to children whose parents are rendered quadriplegic. Ultimately, we held that a minor child may establish a claim for loss of parental consortium by showing (1) a third party tortiously caused the parent to suffer a serious, permanent and disabling mental or physical <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"369\">*369</page-number>injury compensable under Montana law; and (2) the parent\u2019s condition of permanent mental or physical impairment is so overwhelming and severe that it causes the parent-child relationship to be destroyed or nearly destroyed. <em>Keele, </em>258 Mont. at 162, 852 P.2d at 577.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-4\">\u00b678 This Court, over time, has properly developed the law regarding loss of consortium claims between parents and children. That we have expanded the law in this area in the past, however, does not require that we forever approve every expansion of the law presented to us. Nor, in my view, does wisdom support such an approach.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-5\">\u00b679 Loss of consortium is based on the recognition of a legally-protected interest in a personal relationship. <em>See United States v. Standard Oil Co. of Cal. </em>(1947), 332 U.S. 301, 311-12, 67 S.Ct. 1604, 1610, 91 L.Ed. 2067, 2074. Parents bear a natural and legal burden of care for their minor children. Similarly, minor children are legally entitled to the support, aid, affection and guidance of their parents. The same simply is not true for parents and adult children. Not every loss can be made compensable. Inevitably, lines must be drawn establishing the legal limits of liability for a tortious act. As a result, allowing tort claims for loss of consortium by parents of an adult child has less legal and logical support than allowing such claims by parents of a minor child.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-6\">\u00b680 In fact, the majority of jurisdictions which have addressed this issue have not recognized a cause of action for loss of consortium for a parent of an adult child. <em>Boucher v. Dixie Medical Center </em>(Utah 1992), 850 P.2d 1179, 1183. <em>See also Morris v. State </em>(Tenn. Ct. App. 1999), 21 S.W.3d 196, 200; <em>Cole v. Broomsticks, Inc. </em>(Ohio App. 1 Dist. 1995), 669 N.E.2d 253, 256, <em>appeal not allowed, </em>663 N.E.2d 1301; and <em>Counts v. Hospitality Employees, Inc. </em>(Iowa 1994), 518 N.W.2d 358, 361. Reasons for declining to judicially expand the law to recognize claims for parents\u2019 loss of consortium of an adult child include that the injury is too remote from the negligence or too out of proportion to the culpability of the negligent tortfeasor, and allowing recovery would place too unreasonable a burden on negligent tortfeasors and would enter a field that has no sensible or just stopping point. <em>See Morris, </em>21 S.W.3d at 200 (citations omitted). I agree with those reasons.</p>\n<p id=\"b389-7\">\u00b681 I would decline to judicially extend the common law to create a new tort action for a parent\u2019s loss of consortium of an adult child. As is clear from the present case, Ardell had \u2014 and successfully prosecuted \u2014 a claim for compensation for \u201cgrief, sorrow and mental anguish\u201d in the wrongful death action. There is simply no need for yet another judicially- created \u201cremedy.\u201d</p>\n<judges id=\"b389-8\">JUSTICE RICE and JUSTICE WARNER join in the foregoing concurring and dissenting opinion of CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
