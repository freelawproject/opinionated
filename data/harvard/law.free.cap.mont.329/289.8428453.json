Respondent cross-appeals the District Court(s denial of its costs. We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-9\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b312-10\">\u00b62 In 1983 Rodgers purchased a disability policy from defendant MONY Life Insurance Company (MONY). On Rodgers( application for the policy a box was checked indicating that COLA (Cost Of Living Adjustment) benefits were being requested. This application was not accepted by MONY because a policy with COLA benefits required a higher premium than that represented to Rodgers. So, MONY initially issued a policy with COLA benefits and a higher premium, but the terms of this policy required that it had to be accepted by Rodgers before becoming effective.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-11\">\u00b63 Soon thereafter MONY received in the mail a document called a \u201cnew business change,\u201d purportedly signed by Rodgers, which requested that the COLA rider be deleted. Pursuant to this request MONY issued a policy without COLA benefits at the premium rate initially discussed with Rodgers. A copy of this policy without COLA benefits was sent to Rodgers, along with a copy of Rodgers( application with the box checked indicating that Rodgers had requested COLA benefits. Rodgers then began paying premiums on the policy without the COLA benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b312-12\">\u00b64 In 1989, Rodgers became disabled and filed a claim for benefits under the policy. MONY accepted the claim and began paying benefits to Rodgers in 1989, and has continued to pay the policy benefits to Rodgers based on the policy without an increase in the amount paid as COLA benefits.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"293\">*293</page-number>\u00b65 In 1990, Rodgers requested another copy of his policy. In 1991 MONY sent him another copy of both the policy and the application. After receiving these copies, Rodgers raised no issue or complaint regarding lack of COLA payments. He simply continued to accept his benefit payments without COLA.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-4\">\u00b66 Rodgers alleges that he discovered for the first time in April, 2001, that a COLA rider had been requested on the original application for disability insurance. At some later time Rodgers obtained a copy of the new business document that was purportedly signed by him. Rodgers claims this was the first time he had seen the document, and that his signature was forged.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-5\">\u00b67 In 2002, Rodgers filed suit against MONY seeking COLA payments. The District Court granted summary judgment to MONY, finding that by no later than 1991, Rodgers could have, and should have, discovered that he was not getting COLA benefits. Thus, the period of limitations within which Rogers\u2019 complaint would have to have been filed commenced in 1991. Rodgers filed his complaint in 2002, beyond the period provided for by any applicable statute of limitations.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> The District Court dismissed Rogers\u2019 complaint as untimely. The District Court also denied MONY(s demand for costs, ordering that each party pay their own costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b313-6\">\u00b68 The parties raise the following issues on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b313-7\">\u00b69 1. Did the District Court err in granting summary judgment to MONY on Rodgers( COLA related claims?</p>\n<p id=\"b313-9\">\u00b610 2. Did the District Court err in not awarding MONY its costs?</p>\n<p id=\"b313-10\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b313-11\">\u00b611 We review a district court(s summary judgment ruling <em>de novo </em>and employ the same method of evaluation, based upon Rule 56, M.R.Civ.P., as applied by the district court. <em>Andrews v. Plum Creek Mfg., </em>LP., 2001 MT 94, \u00b6 5, 305 Mont. 194, \u00b6 5, 27 P.3d 426, \u00b6 5. Summary judgment is proper if the record discloses no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <em>Lutey Const. v. State </em>(1993), 257 Mont. 387, 389, 851 P.2d 1037, 1038. A party seeking summary judgment has the burden of establishing a complete absence of any genuine factual issues. <em>Howard v. Conlin Furniture No. 2, Inc. </em>(1995), 272 Mont. 433, 436, 901 P.2d 116, 118. Once the moving party has presented evidence to support its motion, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"294\">*294</page-number>the party opposing summary judgment must present material and substantial evidence, rather than conclusory or speculative statements, to raise a genuine issue of material fact. <em>Howard, </em>272 Mont. at 436-437, 901 P.2d at 119. All reasonable inferences that might be drawn from the offered evidence should be drawn in favor of the party opposing summary judgment. <em>Howard, </em>272 Mont. at 437, 901 P.2d at 119.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-4\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"A-yW\">ISSUE I</p>\n<p id=\"b314-5\">\u00b612 Did the District Court err in granting summary judgment to MONY on Rodgers\u2019 COLA related claims?</p>\n<p id=\"b314-6\">\u00b613 The District Court dismissed Rodgers\u2019 claim because he failed to file within the period allowed under any arguably applicable statute of limitations. Rodgers argues he falls within an exception to the general rule concerning when the period of limitations commences.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-7\">\u00b614 For purposes of statutes relating to the time within which an action must be commenced, \u2018a claim or cause of action accrues when all elements of the claim or cause exist or have occurred, the right to maintain an action on the claim or cause is complete, and a court or other agency is authorized to accept jurisdiction of the action[.] \u00a7 Section 27-2-102(l)(a), MCA. This Section further sets out an exception to the general rule concerning when the period of limitations commences:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-8\">(3) The period of limitation does not begin on any claim or cause of action for an injury to person or property until the facts constituting the claim have been discovered or, in the exercise of due diligence, should have been discovered by the injured party if:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-9\">(a) the facts constituting the claim are by their nature concealed or self-concealing; or</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b314-10\">(b) before, during, or after the act causing the injury, the defendant has taken action which prevents the injured party from discovering the injury or its cause.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b314-11\">Section 27-2-102(3), MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b314-12\">\u00b615  Rodgers argues that his claims fall within this exception because MONY allegedly concealed the new business change form from him and he was therefore unaware of any claim he may have had against MONY until he obtained a copy of that document in April 2001. However, as the District Court notes, in both 1983 and again in 1991, Rogers had in his possession both the disability insurance policy showing no COLA benefits and his application showing a request for COLA benefits. In addition, Rodgers had been receiving monthly disability payments under the policy containing no COLA since 1989. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"295\">*295</page-number>As the amount of the monthly payments did not increase, it should have been clear to Rodgers that he was not getting COLA increases under his disability policy. We agree with the District Court that by no later than 1991, Rodgers should reasonably have noticed that he was not receiving COLA benefits, regardless of any alleged forgery. By the time Rodgers filed his claim in 2002, the period of limitations for each of his claims had expired. We affirm the District Court\u2019s Order granting MONY summary judgment.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-4\">ISSUE II</p>\n<p id=\"b315-5\">\u00b616 Did the District Court err in not awarding MONY its costs?</p>\n<p id=\"b315-6\">\u00b617 The District Court ordered that both parties bear their own costs. MONY argues that judgment was entered in its favor and thus under \u00a7 25-10-102, MCA, the District Court was required to award its costs as a matter of course.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-7\">\u00b618 Section 25-10-102, MCA, provides:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-8\">Costs must be allowed, of course, to the defendant upon a judgment in his favor in the actions mentioned in 25-10-101.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-9\">\u00b619 MONY argues that it is entitled to its costs as this is an action included in \u00a7 25-10-101(3), MCA, which states:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b315-10\">[I]n an action for the recovery of money or damages, exclusive of interest, when plaintiff recovers over $50[.]</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b315-11\">\u00b620 Rodgers argues that this action cannot be one of those mentioned in \u00a7 25-10-101(3), MCA, because he is the plaintiff, and he did not recover over $50.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-12\">\u00b621  Section 25-10-102, MCA, specifically reads, \u201cjudgment in [defendant\u2019s] favor in the <em>actions </em>mentioned in 25-10-101.\u201d (emphasis added). The \u201caction\u201d specified in \u00a7 25-10-101(3), MCA, is \u201can action for the recovery of money or damages.\u201d The language, \u201cwhen plaintiff recovers over $50[,]\u201d does not change the type of action. This clause is only applicable to a plaintiff, and denies recovery when a plaintiff recovers less than $50 exclusive of interest. If this Court were to interpret \u00a7 25-10-101(3), MCA, as Rodgers requests, a defendant could never recover costs in an action for recovery of money or damages. Such is not the intent of the Legislature. We conclude that MONY is entitled to recover its costs.</p>\n<p id=\"b315-13\">\u00b622  With one possible exception, this Court has been consistent in affirming a district court\u2019s award of costs in actions for money or damages. <em>See, e.g., Roy v. Neibauer </em>(1981), 191 Mont. 224, 227-28, 623 P.2d 555, 557 (affirming award of costs where defendant prevailed on summary judgment in action for damages); <em>Frigon v. Morrison-Maierle, Inc. </em>(1988), 233 Mont. 113, 125, 760 P.2d 57, 65 (affirming district <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"296\">*296</page-number>court\u2019s award of costs to defendant). In <em>Erickson v. Dairyland Ins. Co. </em>(1990), 241 Mont. 119, 785 P.2d 705, which was not cited by either party to this action, the Court concluded, with no legal analysis or explanation, that the plaintiffs claim was not of the type mentioned in \u00a7 25-10-101, MCA, and thus affirmed the district court\u2019s denial of costs to defendant. <em>Erickson, </em>241 Mont. at 124-25, 785 P.2d at 708. We overrule any portion of <em>Dairyland </em>that interprets \u00a7\u00a7 25-10-101 and 102, MCA, as not requiring that a successful defendant in an action for money or damages recover costs, as such an interpretation would be inconsistent with \u00a7 25-10-102, MCA.</p>\n<p id=\"b316-4\">CONCLUSION</p>\n<p id=\"b316-5\">\u00b623 The judgment in favor of MONY is affirmed. The denial of costs to MONY is reversed. This case is remanded to the District Court for assessment of MONYs costs and entry of judgment therefore.</p>\n<judges id=\"b316-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, LEAPHART and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b313-12\"> The statute of limitations for breach of contract is eight years, fraud is two years, and tort is two or three years.
