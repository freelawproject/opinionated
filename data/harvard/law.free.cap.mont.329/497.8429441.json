We affirm.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-9\">\u00b62 We restate and address the issue on appeal as follows: Must the judgment against Johnson be vacated because the prosecution failed to disclose exculpatory information in its possession to the defense a sufficient time before trial?</p>\n<p id=\"b520-10\">\u00b63 On March 8, 2003, at approximately 2:35 p.m., the Lewis and Clark County Sheriffs Office received a call from a Patricia Granby (Granby). Granby said Johnson was pushing her around, and over the phone the dispatcher heard Johnson say that Granby had better leave before the bullets start flying. Granby left the residence.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-11\">\u00b64 Granby explained to law enforcement that Johnson had threatened her by pointing a gun at her. She also said that Johnson was carrying multiple weapons around the house, and ammunition was found at multiple windows. Johnson refused to come out of the house and threatened to shoot the officers.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-12\">\u00b65 After evacuating the neighbors, warrants to arrest Johnson and search the house were obtained. Tear gas was shot into the house at two different times. The second time tear gas was deployed, Johnson fired a shotgun from inside the house and some pellets hit a deputy sheriff and a police officer. Johnson surrendered at approximately 4:15 a.m. the next morning, and he was taken into custody.</p>\n<p id=\"b520-13\">\u00b66 Johnson was charged with assault with a weapon, two counts of attempted deliberate homicide, criminal possession of dangerous drugs, threats and other improper influence in official and political <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"501\">*501</page-number>matters, and criminal endangerment. A jury trial was held in September 2003.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-4\">\u00b67 On the first day of trial, Johnson filed a motion in limine to preclude the State from using a diagram that depicted the scene where the incident took place. This diagram included measurements and notations generated by a laser measuring program called Total Station. The defense objected to this diagram because it had no ability to review the exhibit, interview the Highway Patrol officers who ran the program, determine if the program was run correctly, research the reliability of the program or seek expert assistance for the interpretation of the program. The essence of Johnson\u2019s objection was that use of the diagram was unfair surprise and it could not fairly be allowed into evidence because his counsel had no opportunity to prepare to cross-examine and impeach the state\u2019s witnesses, or to attack the results generated by the Total Station program. Johnson did not argue that this evidence may have been exculpatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-5\">\u00b68 The motion in limine also asked the District Court to preclude the State from using certain photographs on the grounds that they had not been disclosed to the defense until shortly before trial. Johnson did not argue that this evidence may have been exculpatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b521-6\">\u00b69 The District Court held an evidentiary hearing on these matters on September 9, 2003. In considering the diagram, the following exchange occurred:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-7\">THE COURT: So do you have anything else to say on the Total Station business? I don\u2019t think we need to-in my view you got it too late, but I think they can still use a similar chart without the Total Station numbers. They can draw in what Detective Olson did and they can end up-I think it is going to be similar, but I guess I think the Total Station numbers should not be shown to the jury since you got them late Friday. Do you have anything to add on that?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-8\">JOHNSON\u2019S COUNSEL: That is what I was asking for.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b521-9\">THE COURT: Well, that is what you have. So I think you can-you know, I\u2019ll direct you, Mr. Gallagher, to cross off the numbers.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AhhX\">This decision seemed to satisfy Johnson, and he does not indicate that this decision was not followed.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> Also, at the evidentiary hearing, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"502\">*502</page-number>Johnson did not argue that the evidence objected to may have been exculpatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-4\">\u00b610 Concerning the photographs, Johnson\u2019s counsel objected to four or five photographs she had never seen. There was some dispute whether these photographs were made available to her. At the evidentiary hearing, Johnson did not argue that this evidence may have been exculpatory.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-5\">\u00b611 Johnson was found guilty on all counts except for assault with a weapon. Johnson was sentenced to life in prison on November 6,2003. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-6\">\u00b612  Suppression of material evidence favorable to the accused by the prosecution violates a defendant\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment guarantee of due process. <em>See Brady v. Maryland </em>(1963), 373 U.S. 83, 86, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 1196, 10 L.Ed.2d 215, 218. In Montana, a party seeking to establish a <em>Brady </em>violation must establish the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"At3\">(1) the State possessed evidence, including impeachment evidence, favorable to the defense; (2) the petitioner did not possess the evidence nor could he have obtained it with reasonable diligence; (3) the prosecution suppressed the favorable evidence; and (4) had the evidence been disclosed, a reasonable probability exists that the outcome of the proceedings would have been different.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b522-7\"><em>Gollehon v. State, </em>1999 MT 210, \u00b6 15, 296 Mont. 6, \u00b6 15, 986 P.2d 395, \u00b6 15. The burden of establishing a <em>Brady </em>violation in the present case rests with Johnson. <em>Gollehon, </em>\u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-8\">\u00b613  This Court has made it clear that a party\u2019s theory may not change on appeal. This is because it is fundamentally unfair to fault a district court for failing to rule correctly on an issue it never had the opportunity to consider. <em>State v. Mallak, </em>2005 MT 49, \u00b6 31, 326 Mont. 165, \u00b6 31, 109 P.3d 209, \u00b6 31.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-9\">\u00b614 The present case involves a change in theory on appeal. At the District Court, Johnson objected to the diagram because the information generated by the Total Station program was unfair surprise. Johnson objected to the photographs for basically the same reason. At no time before the District Court did Johnson object to either the diagram or the photographs because they were, or could have been, exculpatory evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b522-10\">\u00b615  Even were we to consider Johnson\u2019s <em>Brady </em>arguments, he makes no showing that the information generated by the Total Station program would in any way be exculpatory. He merely suggests that the information could be used to refute the State\u2019s contention that he <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"503\">*503</page-number>intended to shoot at the officers, but he fails to explain how. Since Johnson has failed to show that the numbers generated by the Total Station were favorable to him, he cannot establish a <em>Brady </em>violation regarding the diagram.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-4\">\u00b616 Also, Johnson failed to provide us with a copy of the photographs in question. We will decline to address an argument when the party fails to provide a sufficient record to enable us to rule upon the issue raised. Rule 9(a), M.R.App.P.; <em>Gentry Mont. Enters., Inc. v. McDonald, </em>2004 MT 322, \u00b6 39, 324 Mont. 67, \u00b6 39, 101 P.3d 767, \u00b6 39.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-5\">\u00b617 Further, Johnson makes no showing that the photographs Eire in any way exculpatory. Since Johnson has failed to show that the photographs were favorable to him, he cannot establish a <em>Brady </em>violation relating to their late receipt by his counsel.</p>\n<p id=\"b523-6\">\u00b618 Affirmed.</p>\n<judges id=\"b523-7\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES NELSON, COTTER and MORRIS concur.</judges>\n<footnote label=\"1\">\n<p id=\"b521-10\"> He does claim that witnesses testified to trajectories and measurements based on the Total Station, but we need not consider this claim since he fails to cite to where such testimony occurred in the record. <em>See State v. Kearney, </em>2005 MT 171, \u00b6 16, 327 Mont. 485, \u00b6 16, 115 P.3d 214, \u00b6 16; Rule 23(a)(4), M.R.App.P.</p>\n</footnote>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
