The court sentenced Cesnik to the Montana State Prison for a term of ten years with six of those years suspended. Cesnik appeals on two grounds. First, he argues that the District Court incorrectly admitted testimony at trial referencing offensive phrases displayed on Cesnik\u2019s truck and clothing. Second, Cesnik argues that the District Court improperly based the sentence on negative inferences drawn from his silence at the sentencing hearing. We affirm and reverse.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-5\">\u00b62 We restate the issues as follows:</p>\n<p id=\"b84-6\">\u00b63 1. Whether the District Court correctly admitted evidence of phrases on Cesnik\u2019s truck and clothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-8\">\u00b64 2. Whether the District Court imposed a legal sentence when it based Cesnick\u2019s punishment, in large part, on his refusal to accept responsibility and show remorse.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-9\">FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b84-10\">\u00b65 The weekend of July 26, 2003, the Flathead Valley Clay Target Club, a trap shooting club, sponsored a three-day registered shoot, sanctioned by the American Trapshooters Association (ATA) and the Montana State Trapshooters Association (MSTA). During the event, Robert Cesnik, Sr., became upset over a discrepancy involving a shoot his son won on Friday. Cesnik believed the club unfairly required his son to participate in a re-shoot because of a complaint filed by Keith Brian Sipe-a complaint Cesnik contends did not conform with ATA laws. On Saturday morning, Cesnik walked into the club and engaged in a verbal altercation with Sipe. Cesnik then exited the building and, according to witnesses, retrieved his shotgun from the shotgun rack, loaded it with what appeared to be a live round, closed the shotgun and motioned for Sipe to come outside. Some time after the incident, Sipe notified police, resulting in the State charging Cesnik with the crime of assault with a weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b84-11\">\u00b66 Throughout proceedings, Cesnik maintained his innocence, arguing that by the time he exited the building, he had begun focusing on his shoot and was not threatening Sipe. Consistent with his position regarding the events that transpired, Cesnik pled not guilty and requested a trial by jury. Cesnik filed a motion <em>in limine </em>prior to trial requesting that the court preclude any argument or testimony regarding inflammatory writings or expletives appearing on Cesnik\u2019s <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"65\">*65</page-number>truck and clothing. Cesnik\u2019s truck contained writings that stated \u201cFuck Liberals,\u201d but with the \u201cF\u201d reversed so that it apparently read, \u201cPuck Liberals\u201d (as in a hockey puck). His truck also contained the wording \u201cpro-gun,\u201d and a phrase with a Spanish expletive-\u201cchinga Calif. Liberals.\u201d Cesnik had also worn clothing with similar phrases. Because some club members objected to the visibility of such language on Cesnik\u2019s truck when parked in the club\u2019s lot, the board asked him to lower his tailgate and back in when attending the club. Cesnik complied with this request.</p>\n<p id=\"b85-4\">\u00b67 Cesnik filed a motion <em>in limine </em>to bar reference to these phrases at trial, arguing that the language on his truck and clothing had no relevance to the charges to be tried and that the introduction of such evidence created an unfair prejudice. The District Court did not rule on the motion <em>in limine. </em>Dining the two-day trial, Cesnik repeatedly objected to the State\u2019s attempts to solicit testimony regarding the language on his truck and clothing. Eventually, the court admitted the evidence during the testimony of Rick L. Craig, vice-president of the club. During direct examination of Craig by Cesnik\u2019s attorney, the following exchange took place:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-5\">Cesnik\u2019s Attorney: Okay. As a board member, do you know whether Mr. Sipe has been interested in getting Mr. Cesnik banned from the trap club?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-6\">Craig: Oh, I think there was definitely an interest on Mr. Sipe\u2019s part to have Bob removed.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-7\">Cesnik\u2019s Attorney: Has Mr. Cesnik ever been banned from your trap club?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-8\">Craig: No.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-9\">The State then cross-examined Craig:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-10\">State: You mentioned a discussion to possibly ban Mr. Cesnik from the gun club. That was a general discussion among several of the club members, correct?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-11\">Craig: I don\u2019t know what \u201cseveral of the club members\u201d means, but there was a discussion amongst a few of them.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-12\">State: And this has to do with different behaviors the Defendant has engaged in?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-13\">Craig: Yes.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-14\">State: Are they offensive behaviors?</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-15\">Craig: In my opinion, no.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-16\">State: In the opinion of some of the other club members?</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b85-17\">Cesnik objected to this questioning of Craig by the State:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b85-18\">Cesnik\u2019s Attorney: Objection, he can\u2019t testify to the opinions of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"66\">*66</page-number>other club members.\u201d</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-4\">Court: No, you asked him if-whether or not there was definitely an interest in Mr. Sipe-in having the Defendant removed from the trap club, and the State\u2019s entitled to inquire as to a basis for that. The door\u2019s been opened for that purpose, so the objection is overruled.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b86-5\">The State then proceeded to ask the witness specifically whether Cesnik\u2019s truck and clothing contained the phrases \u201cfuck Californians, fuck liberals.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b86-6\">\u00b68 Cesnik testified at trial, maintaining his innocence regarding the offense charged. When asked by his attorney if he picked up his weapon to threaten Sipe, Cesnik responded, \u201cNo, sir,\u201d explaining that he picked up his weapon in order \u201c[t]o proceed to the practice trap to shoot a round.\u201d At the end of the two-day trial, a jury found Cesnik guilty of assault with a weapon.</p>\n<p id=\"b86-7\">\u00b69 Prior to sentencing, the Department of Corrections, Office of Probation and Parole, prepared a presentence report. When interviewing Cesnik for the report, the probation officer asked Cesnik to provide his thoughts on how the court should proceed with his sentence. Cesnik responded: \u201cI\u2019m not being a smart-ass, my charges should be dropped.\u201d</p>\n<p id=\"b86-8\">\u00b610 While Cesnik testified at trial, he chose not to speak at the sentencing hearing. Cesnik\u2019s counsel did not invoke Cesnik\u2019s right to remain silent; nor did the District Court comment on his silence. After hearing testimony, the court stated the basis for its sentencing decision, in significant part, reflected its concern over Cesnik\u2019s tendency toward violent outbursts, and his continued denial and lack of remorse for such incidences.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-9\">[T]he Court has concern at page 4 of the presentence report where the Defendant is asked to give his own statement: \u201cIn your own words what did you do to get arrested on this charge?\u201d And quoting the Defendant-this isn\u2019t my language-he, Cesnik, \u201cI called Brian Sipe a motherfucker.\u201d That\u2019s not what he was convicted of, and that\u2019s not what the evidence indicated he did. He did do that, but that\u2019s not why we\u2019re here. ...</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b86-10\">And in further-giving rise to further concern as to a lack of acceptance of responsibility, when the officer, through this report, asked Mr. Cesnik, the Defendant, to give his recommendation as to what the Court should do, he says, \u201cI\u2019m not being a smart-ass, my charges should be dropped.\u201d This is after he has been convicted of threatening a person with a loaded shotgun.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"67\">*67</page-number>These are concerns that the court has. Refusal to accept responsibility is a big one.... [W]ithout remorse and acceptance of responsibility, you cannot have rehabilitation, it doesn\u2019t happen.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-4\">And the record will reflect the Judge agrees.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-5\">There is evidence here of a history of violence. As I have indicated, remorse is important. There is none here. A purpose in sentencing in the State of Montana is-it\u2019s many-fold, the Court must try to promote rehabilitation, it must impose a sanction for the behavior that the Defendant has been convicted of engaging in, it must consider protection of society. And what is contemplated here is something that hopefully will accomplish all that without taking away from this Defendant what he threatened to take away from Brian Sipe.... [T]here needs to be structure here so that acceptance of responsibility occurs.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-6\">And it is for that reason that the Court is inclined to follow more the recommendation made by the State than by the Defendant, or, in the middle, that made by the presentence investigation .... And I think under the totality of the circumstances, and having listened to all of the evidence, and clearly recalling the circumstances as they were portrayed and found to have occurred by a unanimous jury of 12 citizens, the Court is prepared to enter judgment here ....</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b87-7\">... The Court observed then, and it\u2019s affirmed by this presentence report, there was no remorse or even then acceptance of responsibility on the Defendant\u2019s part.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b87-8\">\u00b611 The District Court sentenced Cesnik to a term of ten years at the Montana State Prison, with six years of incarceration suspended. Cesnik appealed the decision to this Court, arguing that the District Court improperly admitted evidence regarding the material on Cesnik\u2019s truck and clothing, and improperly penalized Cesnik during sentencing for maintaining his innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b87-9\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b87-10\">\u00b612 \u201cThis Court\u2019s standard review of rulings on the admissibility of evidence, including oral testimony, is whether the district court abused its discretion.\u201d <em>State v. Snell, </em>2004 MT 334, \u00b6 17, 324 Mont. 173, \u00b6 17, 103 P.3d 503, \u00b6 17. <em>See also State v. Castle, </em>1999 MT 141, \u00b6 11, 295 Mont. 1, \u00b6 11, 982 P.2d 1035, \u00b6 11. \u201cThe determination of whether evidence is relevant and admissible is left to the sound discretion of the trial judge and will not be overturned absent a showing of abuse <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"68\">*68</page-number>of discretion.\u201d <em>Snell, </em>\u00b6 17. <em>See also State v. Monaco </em>(1996), 277 Mont. 221, 225, 921 P.2d 863, 866; <em>State v. Stringer </em>(1995), 271 Mont. 367, 374, 897 P.2d 1063, 1067; and <em>State v. Passama </em>(1993), 261 Mont. 338, 341, 863 P.2d 378, 380. \u201cA district court\u2019s ruling on a motion <em>in limine </em>is an evidentiary ruling and the court has broad discretion in determining whether evidence is relevant and admissible, and as such, we will not overturn a district court\u2019s determination absent an abuse of that discretion.\u201d <em>Snell, </em>\u00b6 17.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-4\">\u00b613 \u201cThis Court reviews a criminal sentence for legality only.\u201d <em>State v. Shreves, </em>2002 MT 333, \u00b6 8, 313 Mont. 252, \u00b6 8, 60 P.3d 991, \u00b6 8. <em>See also State v. Burkhart, </em>2004 MT 372, \u00b6 58, 325 Mont. 27, \u00b6 58, 103 P.3d 1037, \u00b6 58; <em>State v. J.C., </em>2004 MT 75, \u00b6 36, 320 Mont. 411, \u00b6 36, 87 P.3d 501, \u00b6 36; <em>State v.

Craig, vice-president of the club, and a witness for the defense, \u201cwhether Mr. Sipe has been interested in getting Mr. Cesnik banned from the trap club.\u201d Craig responded, \u201cOh, I think there was definitely an interest on Mr. Sipe\u2019s part to have Bob removed.\u201d During cross-examination, the State followed up on this line of questioning by asking Craig whether several club members discussed banning Cesnik due to perceived \u201coffensive behaviors.\u201d Cesnik objected to the State\u2019s questions, arguing that the witness \u201ccan\u2019t testify to opinions of other club members.\u201d The Court overruled Cesnik\u2019s objection, noting that Cesnik opened the door to inquiries about why Sipe and some other club members wanted to remove Cesnik from the trap club. Given permission by the court, the State proceeded to ask the witness about the phrases \u201cfuck Californians, fuck liberals\u201d on Cesnik\u2019s truck and clothing.</p>\n<p id=\"b88-8\">\u00b615 On appeal, Cesnik asserts that the District Court improperly allowed testimony referencing the phrases because the evidence had no relevance to the question of Cesnik\u2019s guilt, caused prejudice, and may have confused the issues. We must address whether the District Court abused its discretion by allowing into evidence the phrases on Cesnik\u2019s truck and clothing. Importantly, \u201c[t]rial courts have broad discretion to determine whether evidence is relevant and admissible, and, absent a showing of abuse of discretion, these determinations will <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"69\">*69</page-number>not be overturned.\u201d <em>State v. Strauss, </em>2003 MT 195, \u00b6 18, 317 Mont. 1, \u00b6 18, 74 P.3d 1052, \u00b6 18 (citing <em>State v. Osborne, </em>1999 MT 149, \u00b6 23, 295 Mont. 54, \u00b6 23, 982 P.2d 1045, \u00b6 23).</p>\n<p id=\"b89-4\">\u00b616 Rule 401, M.R.Evid., defines \u201crelevant evidence\u201d as \u201cevidence having any tendency to make the existence of <em>any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence. </em>Relevant evidence may include evidence bearing upon the credibility of a witness or hearsay declarant.\u201d (Emphasis added.) Since Cesnik opened the door to the question of whether Sipe wanted Cesnik banned from the club, testimonial evidence of certain phrases on Cesnik\u2019s truck and clothing were relevant to the jury\u2019s understanding of the strained relationship between the two men. The evidence that Sipe wanted Cesnik removed from the club was relevant to explaining additional motivation for Cesnik assaulting Sipe, and also, why Sipe would have had reason to experience fear and/or apprehension of Cesnik. The explanation of the ongoing conflict between Cesnik and Sipe necessarily referenced the language on Cesnik\u2019s truck and clothing. Cesnik argues that the evidence should have been excluded as prejudicial because it \u201cserved no purpose other than to inflame the passions of the jury and to confuse the issues.\u201d All relevant evidence is admissible, even that which is prejudicial. Relevant evidence is only excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of <em>unfair </em>prejudice. Rule 403, M.R.Evid. Here, the probative value of the evidence was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-5\">\u00b617  We conclude that the District Court did not err in admitting the evidence. It provided further context to the animosity between Cesnik and Sipe and explained why Sipe wanted Cesnik removed from the club-an issue which Cesnik\u2019s counsel broached on direct examination of Craig. The District Court did not abuse its discretion by admitting the disputed evidence.</p>\n<p id=\"b89-6\">ISSUE 2</p>\n<p id=\"b89-7\">\n<em>Whether the District Court imposed a legal sentence when it based Cesnick\u2019s punishment, in large part, on his refusal to accept responsibility and show remorse.</em>\n</p>\n<p id=\"b89-8\">\u00b618 On appeal Cesnik, noting his assertion of innocence and that he did not testify on his own behalf at the sentencing hearing, argues that the court improperly imposed a harsher sentence by interpreting his silence as a refusal to accept responsibility and show remorse. In support of his argument, Cesnik relies upon our decision in <em>State v. </em><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"70\">*70</page-number><em>Shreves, </em>2002 MT 333, 313 Mont. 252, 60 P.3d 991, in which we stated the following narrow rule: \u201ca sentencing court may not draw a negative inference of lack of remorse from the defendant\u2019s silence at sentencing where he has maintained, throughout the proceedings, that he did not commit the offense for which he stands convicted-i.e., that he is actually innocent.\u201d <em>Shreves, </em>\u00b6 22. We noted that our decision stood \u201cgrounded in state and federal constitutional protections against self incrimination.\u201d <em>Shreves, </em>\u00b6 22. <em>Shreves, </em>in other words, turned on the proposition that a court cannot impose a harsher sentence due to the defendant having invoked his constitutional right to remain silent.</p>\n<p id=\"Amc\">\u00b619 Unlike the defendant in <em>Shreves, </em>Cesnik did not invoke his right to remain silent at the sentencing hearing. \u201cA person claiming the protection of the Fifth Amendment generally must affirmatively invoke it.\u201d <em>State v. Fuller </em>(1996), 276 Mont. 155, 160, 915 P.2d 809, 812 (citation omitted). If a defendant \u201cfails to assert the privilege, it will be deemed waived.\u201d <em>Fuller, </em>276 Mont. at 160, 915 Mont. at 812 (citations omitted). Not only did Cesnik fail to expressly invoke his constitutional right to remain silent during sentencing, the court did not mention, nor allude to Cesnik\u2019s silence as a factor in determining punishment.</p>\n<p id=\"A99\">\u00b620 The court\u2019s harsher sentence was not based on what Cesnik <em>did not </em>say, but rather, on what he <em>did </em>say-that is, Cesnik insisted that he was innocent. At the outset of the sentencing hearing, the court observed that Cesnik refused to accept responsibility and show remorse, evidenced by his response during the presentence report interview when he told the probation officer that his \u201ccharges should be dropped.\u201d Dismayed by Cesnik\u2019s comment, the court spent the remainder of the hearing commenting on the need to impose a sentence that would instill acceptance of responsibility in Cesnik. To this end, the court imposed a sentence of ten years with six years suspended.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-4\">\u00b621 In <em>Shreves, </em>we held that, while \u201clack of remorse can be considered as a factor in sentencing, we cannot uphold a sentence that is based on a refusal to admit guilt.\u201d <em>Shreves, </em>\u00b6 20. Since Shreves expressly invoked his right to remain silent, we concluded that the sentencing court could not, based on that silence, infer lack of remorse and failure to accept responsibility. Here, although Cesnik did not expressly invoke his right to remain silent, he did maintain his innocence.</p>\n<p id=\"b90-5\">\u00b622 We discussed the above <em>Shreves </em>reasoning in <em>State v. Burkhart, </em>2004 MT 372, \u00b6 59, 325 Mont. 27, \u00b6 59,103 P.3d 1037, \u00b6 59. In <em>Burkhart </em>we determined that the record failed to \u201creflect that the court considered Burkhart\u2019s silence at the sentencing hearing as lack of <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"71\">*71</page-number>remorse\u201d or that \u201cBurkhart\u2019s sentence was in large part based upon the fact that he refused to take responsibility and admit his crime.\u201d <em>Burkhart, </em>\u00b6 60 (citing <em>Shreves, </em>\u00b6 13). We affirmed the court\u2019s careful consideration of many relevant factors in sentencing Burkhart. <em>Burkhart, </em>\u00b6 60.</p>\n<p id=\"b91-4\">\u00b623 In <em>State v. Imlay </em>(1991), 249 Mont. 82, 91, 813 P.2d 979, 985, we held that a defendant has a constitutional right against self-incrimination, \u201cwhich prohibit[s] augmenting a defendant\u2019s sentence because he refuses to confess to a crime or invokes his privilege against self-incrimination.\u201d In that case, after a jury convicted the defendant of sexual assault, the court sentenced him to prison with certain conditions, including the condition that he complete a sexual therapy program. <em>Imlay, </em>249 Mont. at 84, 813 P.2d at 981. In order to participate in the treatment program, an inmate had to admit committing the crime-an action Imlay refused to take. The District Court consequently revoked the defendant\u2019s suspended sentence. On appeal, we observed that \u201cthe defendant is being subjected to a penalty that he would not otherwise be subjected to if he would simply admit his guilt.\u201d <em>Imlay, </em>249 Mont. at 90, 813 P.2d at 985. We held this to be a violation of the defendant\u2019s right against self-incrimination.</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b91-5\">While the sentencing judge may take into account his belief that the defendant was not candid with the court, this is to be distinguished from the rule that a sentence may not be augmented because a defendant refuses to confess or invokes his privilege against self-incrimination.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b91-6\"><em>Imlay, </em>249 Mont. at 88-89, 813 P.2d at 984 (citations omitted). We then explained that because \u201cour system still provides ... for opportunities to challenge [the] conviction,\u201d compelling a defendant \u201cto admit guilt as a condition to his continued freedom\u201d would render meaningless our criminal justice system. <em>Imlay, </em>249 Mont. at 90-91, 813 P.2d at 985.</p>\n<p id=\"AKY\">\u00b624 Here, in imposing sentence, the court noted that Cesnik, even \u201c... after he has been convicted of threatening a person with a loaded shotgun,\u201d told the probation officer, \u201cI\u2019m not being a smart-ass, my charges should be dropped.\u201d Contrary to the situation in <em>Burkhart, </em>it is apparent that the court was dismayed at Cesnik\u2019s refusal to acknowledge the jury\u2019s verdict and that the court placed considerable weight on the fact that Cesnik, despite having been convicted of the offense, had not accepted responsibility for his acts. That is, he would not admit to having committed the crime. Given that Cesnik had consistently maintained his innocence and had a right to appeal his conviction, such an admission would have undermined his <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"72\">*72</page-number>constitutionally protected right not to incriminate himself and rendered his appeal meaningless.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-4\">\u00b625  We hold that a sentencing court may not punish a defendant for failing to accept responsibility for the crime when that defendant has expressly maintained his innocence and has a right to appeal his conviction.</p>\n<p id=\"b92-5\">\u00b626 We affirm the conviction and reverse the imposition of sentence and remand for a new sentencing.</p>\n<judges id=\"b92-6\">CHIEF JUSTICE GRAY, JUSTICES COTTER, MORRIS and NELSON concur.</judges>\n</opinion>\n</casebody>\n",
