Andy Skinner and Carol Skinner (Skinners) cross-appeal the denial of a post-trial motion for attorney fees and costs, and they join Daniel Glover (Glover), Intervenor, in responding to Allstate. The District Court held that the Skinners had insurance coverage under their Allstate Personal Umbrella Policy (umbrella policy) for a suit filed against them by Glover for injuries he sustained while working as a carpenter on the construction of the Skinners\u2019 residence. We reverse in part and remand.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-4\">\u00b62 We consider the following issue on appeal:</p>\n<p id=\"b534-5\">\u00b63 Did the District Court err in concluding that Allstate had a duty to indemnify Andy Skinner for damages he potentially owes in a separate action filed by Glover against Skinner?</p>\n<p id=\"b534-6\">BACKGROUND</p>\n<p id=\"b534-7\">\u00b64 The Skinners, as individuals, contracted with their business, Skinner Enterprises, Inc. (SEI), to build them a house at Hauser Lake near Helena, Montana. The Skinners are the sole shareholders of SEI, a C corporation which has been in construction and other businesses for thirty-five years. Glover was employed by SEI as a carpenter on August 14, 1998, when, during the course of his work on the construction of the Skinners\u2019 house, he was injured. At the time of the injury, the Skinners carried business insurance through other companies, but Andy Skinner also carried a homeowner\u2019s umbrella policy with Allstate.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-8\">\u00b65 On November 3, 1998, Glover filed a third-party claim seeking recovery from the Skinners. The Skinners sought defense to Glover\u2019s suit under a primary homeowner\u2019s policy from Safeco Insurance Company (Safeco) as well as under the umbrella policy from Allstate. Both companies refused either liability or defense coverage relating to Glover\u2019s suit.</p>\n<p id=\"b534-9\">\u00b66 On August 9, 1999, the Skinners filed a declaratory judgment action against Safeco, Allstate, United States Fidelity and Guaranty Company (USF&amp;G), and the State Compensation Insurance Fund (State Fund) to determine defense, coverage, and indemnification obligations to the Skinners for Glover\u2019s claim under their various business, workers\u2019 compensation, and personal liability policies. The State Fund was subsequently removed as a party by stipulation, and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"515\">*515</page-number>USF&amp;G was dismissed through summary judgment. On October 23, 2000, Glover joined the Skinners\u2019 declaratory judgment action as an Intervenor. In November 2001, Allstate began providing a defense for the Skinners in the underlying personal injury action filed by Glover. However, Allstate has maintained throughout the course of the declaratory action that it has no obligation to defend under the policy.</p>\n<p id=\"Ae3\">\u00b67 On July 15-16, 2002, the District Court held a bench trial for the purpose of determining whether coverage existed under the Skinners\u2019 Safeco or Allstate personal homeowner\u2019s insurance policies for Glover\u2019s claims. At trial, Andy Skinner testified that all of his actions on the Hauser Lake property regarding the construction of the home were pursuant to his position as an officer or employee of SEI, not as an individual.</p>\n<p id=\"b535-4\">\u00b68 The District Court thereafter determined that on August 14,1998, the date of the accident, the Skinners did not have a Safeco primary insurance policy in effect, and, therefore, Safeco had no duty either to defend or indemnify the Skinners for Glover\u2019s claims. However, the District Court, concluding that the Allstate homeowner\u2019s umbrella policy was in effect at the time of the accident and that it provided excess liability insurance coverage for the Skinners, stated the following:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-5\">Conclusions of Law</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-6\">9. Allstate contends that because Andy Skinner\u2019s involvement in the construction project was as a representative of Skinner Enterprises and not as an individual, the business pursuits exclusion of the Allstate policy applies. Glover was working for Skinner Enterprises and Skinner Enterprises was doing the work. However, the Skinners as individuals, not Skinner Enterprises, own the property. The evidence shows that Andy was building the home as a secondary residence. Therefore, he potentially could be personally liable as the homeowner for any injuries Glover may have sustained while working on the home. For these reasons, the Court concludes that the business pursuits exclusion does not apply.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b535-7\">10. Although no primary policy of insurance was in effect on August 14,1998, Andy would be considered to be self-insured for the first $50,000 of any potential recovery by Glover. Therefore, if Glover recovers a judgment against the Skinners, Allstate would be liable for any amount in excess of $50,000.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b536-3\"><page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"516\">*516</page-number>\u00b69 Allstate filed a motion to amend the trial court\u2019s judgment, seeking judgment in its favor. The Skinners filed a post-trial motion requesting attorney fees and costs. The District Court did not rule on the motions, which were deemed denied by operation of Rule 59(g), M.R.Civ.P. Allstate then appealed the District Court\u2019s findings of fact, conclusions of law and final judgment, as well as its denial of Allstate\u2019s post-trial motion to amend the judgment. The Skinners appealed the District Court\u2019s denial of its post-trial motion for attorney fees and costs. However, the Skinners joined the brief filed herein by Intervenor Glover, and did not separately brief issues raised in their post-trial motion. Those issues, therefore, have been abandoned on appeal, and we do not address them.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-4\">STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n<p id=\"b536-5\">\u00b610 \u201cOur standard of review pertaining to a district court\u2019s conclusions of law, in rendering a declaratory judgment, is to determine if the court\u2019s interpretation of the law is correct.\u201d <em>City of Great Falls v. Dir. of the Dep\u2019t of Pub. Health and Human Servs., </em>2002 MT 108, \u00b6 10, 309 Mont. 467, \u00b6 10, 47 P.3d 836, \u00b6 10.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-6\">DISCUSSION</p>\n<p id=\"b536-7\">\u00b611 Did the District Court err in concluding that Allstate had a duty to indemnify Andy Skinner for damages he potentially owes in a separate action filed by Glover against Skinner?</p>\n<p id=\"b536-8\">\u00b612 Allstate contends the District Court erred in concluding that the Skinners had coverage for Glover\u2019s claim under their umbrella policy because the Skinners produced no evidence at trial that Andy Skinner was acting in an individual capacity at the time of Glover\u2019s injuries; because the Skinners produced no evidence at trial that the SEI corporate veil should be pierced, thereby exposing the Skinners to individual liability; and because Glover\u2019s receipt of workers\u2019 compensation payments from the State Fund on behalf of Andy Skinner, individually, constitutes an exclusion under the umbrella policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b536-9\">\u00b6 13 The Skinners and Glover acknowledge that Andy Skinner believes his actions on the job site were performed exclusively in the capacity of officer or employee of SEI. They assert, however, that since the evidence at trial established that the Skinners were building the Hauser Lake home as a personal residence, the <em>potential </em>existed for the jury in the underlying action to disagree with Andy Skinner and <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"517\">*517</page-number>to find him personally liable. Thus, they argue that the District Court correctly ruled that the umbrella policy provided applicable coverage.</p>\n<p id=\"AL-\">\u00b614 The parties focus their arguments, understandably, on whether \u201ccoverage\u201d was due to the Skinners.<footnotemark>1</footnotemark> In this context, however, whether \u201ccoverage\u201d was due refers both to whether Allstate owed Andy Skinner a duty to defend him in the underlying action and to whether Allstate had a duty to indemnify Andy Skinner in the event he was found personally liable to Glover. The Skinners\u2019 Complaint in the declaratory action states in part:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-4\">[T]he Plaintiffs pray as follows:</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-5\">1. That the Defendants accept liability for and provide a defense with counsel in both of the actions referred to set forth [sic] above;</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-6\">2. To be indemnified for their expenses and damages awarded, if any, against them from either of the referenced actions herein ....</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b537-7\">The first part of this prayer for relief, as applied to Allstate as a defendant, requests the District Court to impose upon Allstate a duty to defend the Skinners against Glover. The second part specifically requests the District Court to rule that, if the court in the underlying action finds Andy Skinner personally liable for his injuries, then the umbrella policy would apply and Allstate would have a duty to indemnify Andy Skinner and would be responsible to pay any damages in excess of $50,000. Notably, the Skinners did not request the District Comb to decide whether Andy Skinner was <em>actually </em>personally liable for Glover\u2019s injuries. Indeed, in their response to Allstate\u2019s post-trial motion to amend the judgment, the Skinners stated, \u201cThe instant action was over insurance coverage, not one for determining liability or damages as that is left to the Glover action.\u201d Because it did not resolve the issue of Andy Skinner\u2019s liability, however, the District Court\u2019s ruling with respect to Allstate\u2019s duty to indemnify was speculative. Therefore, as explained below, Allstate\u2019s duty to indemnify was a non-justiciable question, and the District Court erred in considering it.</p>\n<p id=\"b537-8\">\u00b615 Justiciability is determined by a three-part test:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b537-9\">First, a justiciable controversy requires that parties have existing and genuine, as distinguished from theoretical, rights or interest. Second, the controversy must be one upon which the judgment of the court may effectively operate, as distinguished from a debate <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"518\">*518</page-number>or argument invoking a purely political, administrative, philosophical or academic conclusion. Third, [it] must be a controversy the judicial determination of which will have the effect of a final judgment in law or decree in equity upon the rights, status or legal relationships of one or more of the real parties in interest, or lacking these qualities be of such overriding public moment as to constitute the legal equivalent of all of them.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"AHM\"><em>Northfield Ins. Co. v. Montana Ass\u2019n of Counties, </em>2000 MT 256, \u00b6 12, 301 Mont. 472, \u00b6 12, 10 P.3d 813, \u00b6 12 (quoting <em>Brisendine v. State, Dept. of Commerce </em>(1992), 253 Mont. 361, 364, 833 P.2d 1019, 1020-21) (brackets in original). In addition,</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-4\">[w]e apply the justiciable controversy test to actions for declaratory judgment to prevent courts from determining purely speculative or academic matters, entering anticipatory judgments, providing for contingencies which may arise later, declaring social status, dealing with theoretical problems, answering moot questions, or giving abstract or advisory opinions.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-5\"><em>Northfield, </em>\u00b6 12. This Court may raise the question of justiciability sua sponte. <em>Dukes v. City of Missoula, </em>2005 MT 196, \u00b6 15, 328 Mont. 155, \u00b6 15, 119 P.3d 61, \u00b6 15.</p>\n<p id=\"b538-6\">\u00b616 In concluding that the umbrella policy did apply in the case before it, the District Court seems to have conflated the law on the duty to defend and the duty to indemnify, which are separate issues. In <em>Travelers Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. v. Ribi Immunochem Research, </em>2005 MT 50, \u00b6 40, 326 Mont. 174, \u00b6 40, 108 P.3d 469, \u00b6 40 (citations omitted), we explained when the duty to defend arises:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b538-7\">We apply the \u201cfourcorners\u201d rule as the policy\u2019s language determines an insurer\u2019s duty to defend its insured. The acts giving rise to the claim form the basis for coverage, not any legal theories contained in the underlying complaint. Simply put, if the asserted claim is not covered by the policy, then the insurer has no duty to defend the insured.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b538-8\">\u201cThe duty to defend is independent from and broader than the duty to indemnify created by the same insurance contract.\u201d <em>Farmers Union Mut. Ins. Co. v. Staples, </em>2004 MT 108, \u00b6 21, 321 Mont. 99, \u00b6 21, 90 P.3d 381, \u00b6 21 <em>(Staples).</em><footnotemark><em>2</em></footnotemark><em> </em>Thus, even when a court concludes that \u201ccoverage\u201d <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"519\">*519</page-number>applies such that an insurer must defend the insured, a fact-finder may later reach a decision on the disputed facts and conclude that an insurer has no duty to indemnify. <em>See Staples, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 22-26. However, in a declaratory judgment action, if there remain unresolved related issues in the underlying action that may ultimately affect whether an insurer has a duty to indemnify, issuing a ruling on indemnity obligations is premature. <em>See Northfield, </em>\u00b6\u00b6 11, 14, 23.</p>\n<p id=\"b539-4\">\u00b617  In <em>Northfield, </em>inmates at the Park County Detention Center filed a class action lawsuit in federal district court alleging negligence, violations of constitutional rights, and infliction of emotional distress on the part of the sheriff and several jailers in relation to alleged sexual abuse. <em>Northfield, </em>\u00b6 3. The Montana Association of Counties, Joint Powers Insurance Authority (MACO) was the insurer for the defendants, and Northfield Insurance Company (Northfield) and Lloyds of London (Lloyds) were secondary insurers for MACO. <em>Northfield, </em>\u00b6 4. Northfield and Lloyds brought a state action seeking a declaratory judgment that they had no duty to indemnify MACO for the claims before the federal court. <em>Northfield, </em>\u00b6 4. In affirming the district court\u2019s dismissal of the declaratory action for non-justiciability, this Court stated, \u201cIt simply is not appropriate to determine whether the conduct of the insureds in the present case falls within the exclusions of the Policy prior to a determination or stipulation as to the underlying facts <em>....\u2019\u2019Northfield, </em>\u00b6 23. In distinguishing the case from our holding in <em>Ridley v. Guaranty Nat. Ins. Co. </em>(1997), 286 Mont. 325, 951 P.2d 987 (reversing the district court\u2019s dismissal for non-justiciability and holding that an action for declaratory judgment need not resolve all issues between the parties), we noted that in <em>Ridley </em>the \u201clegal issue presented for declaratory judgment ... was separate from, and would not be affected by, a final resolution of the liability issue,\u201d and that \u201cwhile a declaratory judgment need not resolve all issues between the parties, it must resolve those issues addressed in a manner that will have the effect of a final adjudication.\u201d <em>Northfield, </em>\u00b6 27. This Court went on to hold in <em>Northfield </em>that</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b539-5\">[t]he judicial determination Northfield and Lloyds seek would serve only as speculative advice, subject to possible amendment or nullification upon final resolution of the underlying federal <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"520\">*520</page-number>case; it would not act as a final adjudication on the indemnification issue. The justiciable controversy test is designed to prevent judgments from resting on such shifting sands.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"A3D\"><em>Northfield, </em>\u00b6 28. Thus, where there remain unresolved relevant issues in the underlying case, inseparable from the issues presented in the declaratory judgment action, the duty to indemnify is not ripe for resolution.</p>\n<p id=\"b540-4\">\u00b618 Other jurisdictions support our law in this respect. In <em>Constitution Assocs. v. New Hampshire Ins. Co. </em>(Colo. 1996), 930 P.2d 556, the Supreme Court of Colorado considered two cases concerning actions for declaratory relief filed by insurance companies to determine their obligations to their respective insureds in the underlying lawsuits prior to the issuance of judgments in those cases. The Court provided a useful summary of the relevant concepts:</p>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-5\">[A]n anticipatory action for declaratory relief must ... concern issues that are independent of and separable from those in the underlying case. Without meeting this standard, a trial court should refuse to hear the action because of the potential prejudice to the parties in the underlying case.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-6\">For example, where it could unduly prejudice the insured in the underlying action, a declaratory judgment action prior to entry of a judgment against the insured is not independent and separable and is inappropriate.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"b540-7\">The independent and separable standard helps to clarify some confusion in the law regarding the interrelationship between an anticipatory declaratory judgment action and the insurer\u2019s duty to defend versus the insurer\u2019s duty to indemnify. The duty to defend pertains to the insurance company\u2019s duty to affirmatively defend its insured against pending claims. The duty to indemnify relates to the company\u2019s duty to satisfy a judgment entered against the insured. The duty to defend is triggered more easily than is the duty to indemnify. Generally, the duty to defend arises where the alleged facts even potentially fall within the scope of coverage, but the duty to indemnify does not arise unless the policy actually covers the alleged harm. Where there is no duty to defend, it follows that there can be no duty to indemnify. However, where there is a duty to defend, there is not necessarily a duty to indemnify.</blockquote>\n<p id=\"b540-8\"><em>Constitution Assocs., </em>930 P.2d at 562-63 (citations and footnotes omitted). This precept of law(that, in a declaratory judgment action, <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"521\">*521</page-number>the issue of an insurer\u2019s duty to indemnify lacks ripeness when the underlying case has yet to resolve inseparable issues(enjoys widespread support. <em>Pettit v. Erie Ins. Exch. </em>(Md. Spec. Ct. App. 1997), 699 A.2d 550, 554, aff'd, 709 A.2d 1287 (Md. 1998); <em>Nationwide Ins. v. Zavalis </em>(7th Cir. 1995), 52 F.3d 689, 693 (construing Pennsylvania law); <em>Guaranty Nat\u2019l Ins. Co. v. Beeline Stores </em>(M.D. Ala. 1996), 945 F.Supp. 1510, 1514-15; <em>David Kleis, Inc. v. Superior Court </em>(Cal. Ct. App. 1995), 44 Cal.Rptr.2d 181, 186-87; <em>North Pac. Ins. Co. v.

App. Ct. 1994), 629 N.E.2d 822, 825-26.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-4\">\u00b6 19 In the present case, the Skinners effectively requested two rulings from the District Court. First, they sought a judgment that Allstate had a duty to defend them in the suit against Glover. Second, they asked for a ruling that, should Andy Skinner be found personally liable in the underlying case, the umbrella policy would cover any damages in excess of $50,000. The first request was justiciable but was simply not addressed by the District Court\u2019s order.<footnotemark>3</footnotemark> The second was non-justiciable because it would be a speculative ruling based on issues inseparable from the underlying action. No court had yet decided the issue of Andy Skinner\u2019s personal liability to Glover, which was a relevant issue (perhaps the relevant issue) in Glover\u2019s action against Skinner. Therefore, the District Court could not properly find, based on the idea that Skinner could \u201cpotentially\u201d be liable, that the umbrella policy\u2019s business pursuits exclusion did not apply, nor could it conclude that \u201cif Glover recovers a judgment against the Skinners, Allstate would be liable for any amounts in excess of $50,000.\u201d In doing otherwise, the District Court\u2019s ruling was not \u201ca final adjudication on the indemnification issue\u201d but rather \u201cspeculative advice, subject to possible amendment or nullification upon final resolution of the underlying\u201d case. <em>Northfield, </em>\u00b6 28. Consequently, we reverse the District Court\u2019s order with respect to its conclusions of law regarding the Allstate umbrella policy.</p>\n<p id=\"b541-5\">\u00b620 We cannot discern from the record whether Allstate\u2019s duty to defend remains at issue because the District Court\u2019s order did not address the issue separately, focusing only on the duty to indemnify. <page-number citation-index=\"1\" label=\"522\">*522</page-number>Further, as noted in \u00b6 8 above, the District Court ruled that the Safeco policy was not in effect at the time Glover suffered his injury. The District Court also deemed Andy Skinner to be self-insured for the first $50,000 in any potential damages. However, the District Court did not resolve how these rulings bear on the interpretation of language in the Allstate umbrella policy that required an underlying primary policy to be in effect, leaving unsettled the status of any duty Allstate may have to defend the Skinners in the underlying action, apart from a duty to indemnify. It is inappropriate for this Court to resolve the question here without the benefit of a ruling by the District Court and briefing by the parties.<footnotemark>4</footnotemark></p>\n<p id=\"b542-4\">\u00b621 Therefore, we reverse the District Court\u2019s order with respect to its conclusions of law regarding the Allstate umbrella policy, and we remand the cause for any proceedings that may be necessary to resolve the question of Allstate\u2019s duty to defend, if it remains at issue.
